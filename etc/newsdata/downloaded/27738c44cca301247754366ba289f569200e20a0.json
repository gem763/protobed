But reports from the city suggested the attack had been small scale.\n\nHowever, it deepened Kurdish fears they would soon find themselves fighting on several fronts, against Turkey, Isis and possibly Iranian or Russian-backed units aligned with Damascus, all without US support.\n\n'People are panicking but life goes on': Syrian Kurds brace for war Read more\n\nA spokesman for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyap Erdo\u011fan, justified the impending invasion by saying that Trump, in a telephone conversation with Erdo\u011fan on Sunday, had handed Turkey the mantle of the counter-Isis battle that the US has been waging alongside Kurdish forces since late 2014.\n\nFahrettin Altun, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s communications director and one of his closest aides, suggested Trump had given the Turkish leader the green light for an invasion, contradicting denials from White House officials.\n\n\u201cDuring a phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Sunday, President Trump agreed to transfer the leadership of the counter-Islamic State campaign to Turkey,\u201d Altun wrote in a commentary in the Washington Post published on Tuesday evening. \u201cThe Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly.\u201d\n\nBrett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) This is not a surprise. The POTUS green-lighting a Turkish attack into NE Syria (that's how it's seen by all parties on the ground and in the region) opens Pandora's box. Expect Russian-backed forces to move as well. Total mess. https://t.co/DycWpDn7RD\n\nAltun portrayed the invasion as a counter-terrorism operation, and described Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria, the YPG, as \u201carmed thugs\u201d who should not resist the Turkish takeover of the area.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether YPG militants will agree to the change in the campaign\u2019s leadership,\u201d he wrote. He added in a later tweet: \u201cYPG militants have two options: They can defect or we will have stop them from disrupting our counter-Isis efforts.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said late on Tuesday night that Turkish forces were already attacking near the border. \u201cThe Turkish military is shelling one of our points on SereKaniye Border with Turkey,\u201d it said in a tweet, referencing the key border town of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nIt was one of the places from which US troops withdrew on Monday, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\n\u201cThere were no injuries to our forces. We didn\u2019t respond to this unprovoked attack,\u201d the SDF said.\n\nThe US withdrawal from northern Syria creates the perfect conditions for war crimes | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nEarly on Monday, US special forces near the Syrian-Turkish border were ordered to withdraw from their posts, to the surprise of Americans and Kurdish commanders. The Pentagon said on Tuesday the redeployment was necessary to avoid US troops being caught in the crossfire.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Turkey has chosen to act unilaterally,\u201d Jonathan Hoffman, chief Pentagon spokesman, said. \u201cAs a result we have moved the US forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish incursion to ensure their safety. We have made no changes to our force presence in Syria at this time.\u201d\n\nThere are also British and French special forces in the region and in the event of a major Turkish-Kurdish conflict the Guardian understands they would be tasked with the bolstering the security of camps where captured Isis fighters are being guarded by the Kurds.\n\n\u201cWe are nervous, and very much against this Turkish offensive,\u201d a European official said on Tuesday. The official expressed hoped that the offensive could be limited in scope and not trigger a full-scale conflict with the YPG (and its broader coalition, the SDF), that could lead to the scattering of Isis prisoners and the movement\u2019s resurgence.\n\n\u201cIf it is an unmitigated Turkish offensive, we are going to suffer serious consequences,\u201d the official said.\n\nMilitary analysts warn of the possibility of a multi-pronged attack on Kurdish-held areas, with Turkey advancing from the north, and militias aligned with the Damascus regime, supported by Iran and Russia striking from the south.\n\n\u201cRussia and Turkey have already discussed Turkey\u2019s upcoming operation,\u201d Jennifer Cafarella, research director at the Institute for the Study of War, said. \u201cRussia supports it at least tacitly and may actually have entered into a general agreement with Turkey on the shape of what is to come in the north-east.\u201d\n\nJoseph Votel, who headed US central command until March and was instrumental in establishing the partnership with the Kurds, said the abrupt policy decision to seemingly abandon Washington\u2019s Kurdish partners could not have come at a worse time.\n\nIn an article he co-written on the Defense One military news site, Votel said: \u201cThis policy abandonment threatens to undo five years\u2019 worth of fighting against Isis and will severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies.\u201d", "description": "Ankara says military will cross border \u2018shortly\u2019, and claims US president gave green light, contradicting US denials", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8de8d5834817be13770501080d484c2fa95d242/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c187efd1e853c3689ef09b380b3550f3", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
