(Al Bello/Getty Images)\n\nTorrey Smith, a former second-round pick out of the University of Maryland who won two Super Bowls during eight NFL seasons and was part of the league\u2019s wave of player activism, announced his retirement Friday in a lengthy and emotional video in which he thanked the sport \u201cfor being my way out.\u201d\n\nSmith, 30, was released by the Carolina Panthers, for whom he played last year, in the final week of the preseason, and did not find another team.\n\n\u201cYou and I both knew the game for me wouldn\u2019t last forever. It\u2019s the NFL circle of life, and I\u2019m prepared for what\u2019s next,\u201d Smith said in the video, which was addressed to the sport of football. \u201c\u2026 Thank you for providing me with the means to provide a better life for my family, for giving me the resources to break generational curses, for helping me set up a life where my kids can become all that they want to be without the struggles that I had to face. Thank you for trusting me with the responsibility of being a leader both on and off the field. My worth as a football player was never only about numbers, and if I was able to impact just one player, one kid, one person, I served my purpose.\u201d\n\nSmith was drafted out of Maryland with the 58th overall pick by the Baltimore Ravens in 2011, never missing a game during his four seasons with the Ravens while becoming one of the league\u2019s most dynamic deep threats. He was the team\u2019s second-leading receiver in its 2012 Super Bowl season, both during the regular season and the playoffs, and had at least 750 receiving yards in all four of his seasons in Baltimore.\n\n[From the archives: Through two decades of hardships, Torrey Smith and his mother helped raise each other]\n\nHe joined the San Francisco 49ers in 2015, again playing all 16 games and leading the NFL with a 20.1 average yards per catch, although he never replicated his Ravens productivity He remained with the 49ers in the 2016 season, when Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protests during the national anthem sparked a surge in NFL player activism. Kaepernick and teammate Eric Reid were at the forefront of that effort, and Smith also became a consistent voice of social activism and political criticism, even as he moved to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2017 and the Panthers last year.\n\nAfter he won his second Super Bowl, with the Eagles following the 2017 season, Smith went on CNN to discuss his decision not to visit the White House.\n\n\u201cIf I told you that I was invited to a party by an individual I believe is sexist, or has no respect for women, or I told you that this individual has said offensive things toward many minority groups and I don\u2019t feel comfortable about it \u2014 this individual also called my peers and my friends SOBs \u2014 you would understand why I wouldn\u2019t want to go to that party,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhy is it any different when the person has the title of president of the United States? It\u2019s really that simple to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that I personally feel inclined to be involved with.\u201d\n\nThe White House later canceled a scheduled visit with the Eagles.\n\nLast year, Smith urged the Panthers to give Reid \u2014 who had been out of the league \u2014 another chance. The Panthers later signed Reid, who remains with the team.\n\n\u201cEric Reid is a Pro-Bowl caliber safety, 26 years old with a first-round pedigree,\u201d Smith said last fall, before the signing. \u201cAnd he\u2019s one of the best men that I know.\u201d\n\n[Terry McLaurin spent his college days preparing for the unexpected. In the NFL, it\u2019s paid off.]\n\nSmith also became a part of the Baltimore community, working as an intern for U.S. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) while he played with the Ravens and remaining involved in the city after he left the team. He and his wife, for example, paid the adoption fees for 46 cats and dogs at an adoption event in Baltimore, and his foundation funded a variety of scholarship and mentorship programs. Last year, the Baltimore Sun named Smith one of 10 people \u201cwho make the Baltimore region better,\u201d writing that \u201che still considers his work in Baltimore a lifelong commitment\u201d and noting that he had been nominated for the NFL\u2019s Walter Payton Man of the Year award three times.\n\nDoug Pederson opened his presser by giving a shoutout to Torrey Smith, who announced his retirement this morning.\n\n\n\n\"Just want to congratulate him and his family. He helped us win a championship and he\u2019s a great man.\" \u2014 Reuben Frank (@RoobNBCS) September 13, 2019\n\nIn the retirement video, Smith said God put football in his life for a reason, \u201cand I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t about Xs and Os.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to using the platform that you\u2019ve given me to continue to serve my true purpose: changing my community for the better,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m blessed to be able to walk away from this game with most of my health, a clear mind and a grateful heart. Can\u2019t wait to begin my next phase of my life where my heart is and never left: Baltimore.\u201d\n\nSmith caught 319 passes for 5,141 yards and 41 touchdowns in his eight-year career.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nThe Raiders, believe it or not, are starting to look like a competent NFL team\n\nSean Payton is moving the Saints past the championship game no-call, but he hasn\u2019t forgotten\n\nAnalysis: The Miami Dolphins are handling their tank job the wrong way\n\nOdell Beckham plans to continue wearing his outrageously expensive watch during games", "description": "The former Maryland star won two Super Bowls during his eight-year NFL career.", "authors": ["Dan Steinberg", "Editor", "Columnist Focusing On Washington Sports", "Its History", "Washington Sports Media", "Sports Blogging", "September At Am", "Dan Steinberg Is An Editor", "Columnist For Sports", "The Founder Of The D.C.
