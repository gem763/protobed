That decision sparked heavy criticism from conservative activists, with many arguing Myeong\u2019s ruling was politically motivated.By contrast, Judge Song Kyung-ho\u2019s decision to grant an arrest warrant for Chung last Thursday invited similar accusations - but this time from the left.At rallies staged by both camps in recent weeks, participants were seen holding up signs mentioning the judges by name to protest their rulings. Far more alarming activity took place on the internet, where pictures of the judges circulated on forums along with threatening suggestions like \u201cexecution by burning\u201d or \u201cdecapitation.\u201dFormer and incumbent judges have expressed alarm at such public hysteria. One attorney who served as a high court judge said he had \u201cnever before seen such criticism\u201d targeted at individual judges, while a sitting judge who used to review warrant requests while serving in a district court said it was impossible for judges not to feel pressured by such public reaction.Another lawyer who used to sit on the bench noted the vulnerability of judges. \u201cUnlike prosecutors, judges do not have an organization to back them up and must deal with such personal attacks individually,\u201d he said.Myeong actually faced a similar public backlash in January when he convicted South Gyeongsang Gov. Kim Kyoung-soo for an opinion meddling case in the last presidential election. After receiving threats, the judge had to seek police protection.In the same statement, the Supreme Court commented on the Blue House\u2019s recent decision to appoint Kim Hyung-yeon, a former judge who served as presidential secretary for legal affairs, to head the Ministry of Government Legislation, a body responsible for supporting the government\u2019s legislative efforts. Since Kim retired as a judge only two years ago in 2017, the court expressed concern that such a short interval could affect judicial independence.BY PARK TAE-IN [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
