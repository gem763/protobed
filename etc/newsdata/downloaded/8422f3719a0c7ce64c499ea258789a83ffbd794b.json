However, he was taken aback when a recent guest let loose with a torrent of words never before heard on the show.\n\nIn a clip from the long-running game show, which was tweeted on Tuesday, as part of his duties as host, Sajak innocuously asked contestant Blair Davis about his family. It\u2019s the game show version of small talk, so what Davis said in response was quite unexpected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trapped in a loveless marriage for the last 12 years to an old battle-ax named Kim,\u201d Davis said, completely straight faced. While the studio audience laughed, Davis wasn\u2019t done yet. \u201cShe cursed my life with three step-children named Star, R.J., and Ryan and I have one rotten grandson.\u201d\n\nWhile the answer seemed to take Sajak by surprise, he has been doing his job a long time and had a quick retort. \u201cNo wonder you came here,\u201d he quipped. \u201cYou just wanted to get away from everybody.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Davis and his emotional well-being, his comments were all in jest, which Sajak confirmed. \u201cI know you\u2019re being facetious \u2014 one would hope,\u201d the host optimistically suggested and Davis admitted he was just joking. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Davis told him. \u201cI love \u2019em like nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nThe moment has gone viral, creating more buzz for the show than the time a contestant mispronounced \u201cflamenco\u201d and cost himself a victory or when a woman failed to solve the easiest puzzle ever.", "description": "Host Pat Sajak just wanted the man\u2019s bio.", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9tVs0H4mW8WZAGQNgXc2rA--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/7dd1e4e81478961dd212ce53d12628c7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
