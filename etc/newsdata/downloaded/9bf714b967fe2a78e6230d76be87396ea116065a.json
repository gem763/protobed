His family's Massachusetts home is up for sale, as is the home of his trainer, Alex Guerrero. All of those factors, according to ESPN's senior NFL insider Adam Schefter, point to Brady departing from New England \u2014 or the NFL as a whole \u2014 upon the culmination of this season.\n\n\"If he's selling his home and his trainer is selling his home and he's voiding his contract, what does that tell you?\" Schefter said on the set of \"Monday Night Football\" ahead of New England's 33-0 victory over the New York Jets.\n\n%InlineRelated-url=\"https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/10/18/former-patriot-chris-long-says-team-suffered-another-loss-that-was-as-big-a-deal-as-gronk/23838981/\" CTA=\"SEE ALSO\" title=\"Former Patriot Chris Long says team suffered another loss that was 'as big a deal as Gronk'\"%\n\nSchefter later made similar comments on his podcast, saying that he believes 2019 is \"shaping up\" to be Brady's \"last year in New England.\"\n\nHe then tripled down on that stance on ESPN's \"Get Up\" on Thursday morning, stating that the six-time Super Bowl champion has three options after this year \u2014 and that staying in New England appears to be \"the least likely.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\n\"He's either staying in New England, he's retiring or he's going to play somewhere else. ...

He has, however, remained with team owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick in New England for two decades now and has seen more success than any other player in league history. His Patriots are currently 7-0 on the season and could be headed for a fourth-straight Super Bowl, which would mark a record tenth appearance in the big game for Brady.\n\nBut father time is surely catching up to the quarterback.
