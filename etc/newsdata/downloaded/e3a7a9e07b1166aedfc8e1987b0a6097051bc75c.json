But neither company obeys it.\n\nInstead, each announced in 2018 that they would stop accepting advertisements for state and local political campaigns in Washington. This shutdown and a combined $450,000 payment were supposed to resolve a lawsuit Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed against the companies for failing to disclose political advertisement transactions.\n\nThe settlement had reasonable enough logic: If the two online advertising Goliaths couldn\u2019t manage to keep political advertising records available for public inspection, then they\u2019d get out of that line of business. But then Facebook and Google tossed the deal glibly aside and went right back to business. Washington needs stronger laws to hold campaigns as well as tech companies accountable for meeting disclosure requirements.\n\nSeattle Times reporter David Gutman reported Monday that Facebook and Google have each freely sold advertising across the political spectrum within Washington during this campaign season. This is their right, provided they follow the disclosure instructions in state law. Google and Facebook have shown no more willingness to obey the rules than before Ferguson first took them to court.\n\nIt defies belief to see companies that make billions of dollars from organizing millions of Americans\u2019 online lives claim they cannot adequately track the advertising. Google and Facebook are publishing advertisements and must obey regulations of venturing into that marketplace, or else withdraw from it.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWashington is among at least five states that have special political restrictions under new disclosure laws, according to Google\u2019s page of advertising restrictions. Yet in the real world, campaigns buy a torrent of ads, and the tech companies are serving them out to thousands upon thousands of users.\n\nThis state must ratchet up its response. Already, the state Public Disclosure Commission has filed a new complaint against Facebook over a fresh round of alleged inadequate record keeping. Spectacularly wealthy, tech-innovating companies can surely comply with a three-sentence state law.\n\nDo you have something to say? Share your opinion by sending a Letter to the Editor.

For much of October, a letter signed by more than 250 Facebook workers has aired a complaint within the company against its laissez-faire approach to political advertising, a situation that is mirrored far beyond the company\u2019s California campus.\n\nAmericans have watched one presidential election cycle dragged into the muck of disinformation and have deep concerns about further destabilization in 2020. For Facebook and Google, the time has arrived to map out terms for political advertising that can be productive in American\u2019s democratic process. If the companies and campaigns continue to fail at cooperation, lawmakers should impose new restrictions on how political business is done.", "description": "Google and Facebook are publishing advertisements and must face up to being accountable to the laws in place for venturing into that arena or else withdraw from the arena.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tsr-political-ads-color-780x501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
