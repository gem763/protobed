So if there is an import surge, that can be dealt with.\"\n\nThe RCEP loomed large at an event in Jakarta on Tuesday organised by IBER, along with the Asian Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nIn a global economy struggling to deal with the US-Sino trade war, the proposed deal should be looked at from a geopolitical, as well as an economic perspective, according to Chatib Basri, senior lecturer at the University of Indonesia and a former Indonesian finance minister.\n\n\u201cASEAN countries, when they have to deal with giants, they can\u2019t do it singly. They should be talking to China, for example, as a single entity. That\u2019s why RCEP is very important.\n\n\u201cAnd with China set to sign up, India is needed to balance the RCEP,\u201d Basri said.\n\nToshinori Doi, director of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research office in Singapore, said regional trade was more important than ever to ASEAN countries' economic expansion against signs of weakening global growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe conclusion of RCEP would be another way to diversify trade. It\u2019s not about decoupling from the US; it\u2019s about diversifying trade opportunities,\" he said.\n\nBut getting India over the line is going to be difficult. Another speaker at the IBER conference suggested an all-party agreed RCEP was only likely to be achieved through the direct intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"Neither China nor India can choose their neighbours,\" said Suman Bery, a non-resident fellow of the Brussels think-tank Bruegel who is based in New Delhi.\n\n\"Integration between the two would give the region a huge push. But cut the leaders a little slack; the issues are fiendishly complicated.\"\n\nNine months ago, the RCEP was just another free trade agreement but it has been elevated in importance due to global upheavals, said Peter Drysdale, head of the Asian Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n\"If it does get over the line at ASEAN, it will be because Prime Minister Modi has grasped the importance of RCEP for the global economic and political order,\" Mr Drysdale said.", "description": "India\u2019s regional partners hope that measures to deal with a fears of a potential 'import surge' from China and other countries will help get the government of Nerendra Modi over the line on a new trade agreement at this weekend's ASEAN summit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7564%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_561%2C$y_70/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/64c3d1d5bded88283a27f371cb283142df84a424", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
