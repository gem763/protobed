They didn\u2019t provide the exact number of residents who fled the camp, but said clashes broke out between Turkey-backed Syrian fighters and Kurdish forces.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com World Syria-Isis-Supporters-Escape-Camp-Kurds"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
