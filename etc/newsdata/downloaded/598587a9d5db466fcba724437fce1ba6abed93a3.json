Bolton, his third national security adviser, amid fundamental disagreements over how to handle major foreign policy challenges like Iran, North Korea and most recently Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cI disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton disputed the president\u2019s version of how the end came in his own tweet shortly afterward. \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote, without elaborating.\n\nResponding to a question from The New York Times via text, Mr. Bolton said his resignation was his own initiative, not the president\u2019s. \u201cOffered last night without his asking,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSlept on it and gave it to him this morning.\u201d", "description": "President Trump had complained privately in recent months that Mr. Bolton was too hawkish, a tension made worse in recent weeks over Iran and North Korea.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/us/politics/10dc-bolton-promo/10dc-bolton-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
