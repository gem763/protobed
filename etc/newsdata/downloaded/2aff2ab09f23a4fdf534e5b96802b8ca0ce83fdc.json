Prices are on track for a weekly gain of\n\nabout 0.8%.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were up 0.1% at $1,515.50.\n\n\"We've received more evidence that global growth is\n\nstruggling. We most likely have a global manufacturing recession\n\nand there is a risk that this spills over into the services,\n\nwhich is why gold has recovered quite rapidly after that\n\nsell-off last week,\" said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.\n\n\"Fundamentals for gold are still positive, we have slowing\n\nglobal growth, lingering trade tensions and we see more rate\n\ncuts by the Fed. So this is an environment where gold should\n\nprosper and prices should be at $1,575 towards the end of the\n\nyear.\"\n\nData from the United States showed services sector activity\n\nslowed to a three-year low in September, following the\n\nmanufacturing sector, which contracted to the weakest level in a\n\ndecade. Hiring by U.S. private employers also slowed further\n\nlast month. Investors will now scan the U.S. non-farm payrolls report\n\ndue at 1230 GMT for clarity on the health of the world's biggest\n\neconomy.\n\nEuropean stocks rose slightly, helped by hopes of easing\n\nmeasures by the Fed, but were on track for their worst weekly\n\nperformance in a year. Two U.S. Fed policymakers on Thursday signalled they are\n\nopen to delivering another rate cut, while Vice Chairman Richard\n\nClarida said the central bank \"will act as appropriate to\n\nsustain a low unemployment rate and solid growth and stable\n\ninflation\". \"Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated in July that this (rate cut)\n\nstep was just an insurance against international risks and not\n\nthe beginning of a new cycle, but in September it became clear\n\nit is a cycle and now more FOMC members are being supportive to\n\nrate cuts,\" said Quantitative Commodity Research analyst Peter\n\nFertig.\n\n\"Yields are declining again, stocks are not performing well,\n\nthe U.S. dollar is flat, which is all supportive to gold.\" US/\n\nUSD/\n\nLower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of\n\nholding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar.\n\nElsewhere, platinum XPT= fell 0.9% to $881.90 an ounce and\n\nwas down over 5% this week, its biggest weekly decline since\n\nMay.\n\nSilver rose 0.2% to $17.59, and palladium XPD=\n\nclimbed 0.3% to $1,658.99, but is set for a 1.3% fall on the\n\nweek, after eight weekly gains.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold gains on global growth fears, eyes on U.S. jobs data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_2_800x533_L_1412601599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
