Two of the patrol cars were set on fire.\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ran for office on promises to address the root causes of organized crime, a strategy he has called \u201cabrazos, no balazos\u201d \u2014 hugs, not bullets. Still, he pushed for the creation of a national guard, aimed at strengthening security in cities with weak local police.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMonday\u2019s attack cast more doubt on the effectiveness of his approach. There were 2,966 homicides in Mexico in August, the most ever recorded for that month. The national guard now has 70,000 members, but many have been dispatched to Mexico\u2019s southern and northern borders to deter migration to the United States, part of a bilateral plan with the Trump administration.\n\nOn Monday, before news of the attack was reported, L\u00f3pez Obrador planned to devote his morning news conference to the topic of security, touting his plan.\n\n\u201cWe are doing it in a professional way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a new strategy where the fundamental thing is to improve the living and working conditions of the people, never again to disregard the Mexicans.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlfonso Durazo, the country\u2019s secretary of public security, said Monday that L\u00f3pez Obrador had inherited a \u201cchronic crisis of insecurity\u201d from previous administrations. But the attack on police in Michoacan suggests that violence \u2014 particularly between criminal groups and the government \u2014 is deepening. The number of security personnel killed Monday was the most in a single incident in recent years.\n\nAD\n\nMichoacan state police were instructed by a local family court Monday to take a woman and her daughter from Aguililla to Morelia, the state capital, as part of a judicial order, Michoacan Gov. Silvano Aureoles said at a news conference. Authorities said they were still looking into the details of what Aureoles called the \u201ccowardly\u201d ambush.\n\nThe government\u2019s public security secretariat tweeted that it \u201ccondemns the attack in which 14 police officers died in Aguililla, Michoac\u00e1n. We are in communication and we will make available to the state government all of our human and technological resources to find the aggressors and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAuthorities did not confirm any arrests. In Mexico, the majority of homicides go unsolved.\n\nState police have been dispatched to several cities in Michoacan where local police have failed to stand up to criminal organizations. In some places, local police are accused of collaborating with organized-crime groups. As of last month, four state police officers had been killed on duty in 2019. But many more have come under attack.\n\nAD\n\nAcross Mexico, 421 officers were killed in 2018, according to the research organization Causa en Com\u00fan. So far in 2019, 308 have been killed. By comparison, 47 police officers in the United States were shot to death while on duty in 2018, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The U.S. population is 2\u00bd times bigger than that of Mexico.\n\nAD\n\nIn August, police in Michoacan discovered 19 bodies in the town of Uruapan. Nine were hung from a bridge along with signs with written threats.\n\nThe Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has gained ground across Mexico, has been outspoken about its intention to take control of parts of Michoacan. In one video, released in September, men claiming to be leaders of the cartel address residents of another of the state\u2019s towns, Tepalcatepec.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis fight is not against the citizens of Tepalcatepec, but it is with El Abuelo and his cartel,\u201d one masked man says in the video, referring to a rival. \u201cIf you want this war to end, take El Abuelo and his cartel out of Tepalcatepec.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "It was the deadliest attack on government security forces in recent years.", "authors": ["Kevin Sieff", "Latin America Correspondent", "Gabriela Mart\u00ednez"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-E4Ba2BifVyAugPh0qi5Djxrg7c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5WEICTHOXEI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
