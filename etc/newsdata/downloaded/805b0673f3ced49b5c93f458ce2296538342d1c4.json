That's what we're doing right now, with Facebook's plan for a new cryptocurrency, known as Libra, which it announced back in June,\" Vestager said in the text of a speech at a conference in Bergen, Norway.\n\n\"We're looking at whether those proposals create risks for competition, so we can be ready to act swiftly if an intervention were to prove necessary,\" she said.\n\nLast month, she sent questionnaires to the 28 members of the Geneva-based Libra Association set up to govern the new currency, asking about the conditions for membership, according to an EU document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe document also asked how Libra-backed products and services will be integrated into Facebook's platforms WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Calibra, how the consumer data would be used and who would own it.\n\nPoliticians, central bankers and regulatory watchdogs have in recent months sounded the alarm about Libra and the disruption risks to the global financial system and the possibility that it may be used for money laundering.\n\nFacebook could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.", "description": "While Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency is not yet available, the EU's Vestager said early scrutiny was justified.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d530f00cd9784221d0014e6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
