We have all seen that I have the potential to just run round the kitchen like a headless chicken.\n\nQ Best thing you have ever eaten?\n\nA I went to Gordon Ramsey\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen in Dubai and had the beef Wellington. Oh my god it was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The type that would make you jump on a seven-hour flight just for that.\n\nQ Who was the most helpful, John or Gregg?\n\nA They have a good cop, bad cop thing going on. Gregg and I got on really well but after a while you realise that John actually gives you loads of subtle hints on things and you really want to impress him.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA Thing you would never cook again?\n\nA Those cherry and duck confit cigars. I have got PTSD over that moment where I had over stretched myself and spread myself too thinly. I tried to do too much and had to drop them from the menu.\n\nAnd I read the comments online with people saying \u2018How did Vicky get through when she left an element out of her dish and Dom didn\u2019t and his was flawless\u2019. I was like no one feels more guilty about that than me. I feel terrible.\n\nQ Who were you closest to?\n\nA That is so hard to answer. I loved everyone I met on the show and it was a real close bond. It was really hard to say goodbye to Adam and Tomasz and Kellie \u2013 who were with me at the start. I think the world of my final four and I am so proud of Jenny going on to do X Factor .\n\nQ What would you cook for friends at a dinner party?\n\nA I would definitely stick to a steak. That is my happy place, my comfort zone and my strong suit.\n\nI\u2019d do a great steak with some potato dauphinois, honey baby carrots, wilted spinach and a nice red wine jus and also a chocolate cake.\n\nGreg Rutherford, 32 - Ex-Olympic long-jumper\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nQ What are your fears for the final of the competition?\n\nA Fundamentally I want to show Gregg and John all of the skills and techniques that I\u2019ve learnt throughout the show. The fear is taking on a little bit too much and getting it wrong.\n\nQ What was your high point of the series?\n\nA Getting to know the other great contestants. I have made life-long friends.\n\nQ What was your low point of the series?\n\nA Sweetbreads... and jam.\n\nQ Do your friends get nervous cooking for you?\n\nA No because nobody ever cooks for me.\n\nQ Worst culinary disaster?\n\nA Sweetbreads... Can you see a pattern here?\n\nQ Who was the most helpful, John or Gregg?\n\nA John with the cooking, Gregg with the comedy.\n\n(Image: BBC/Shine TV)\n\nQ What are they really like?\n\nA At the beginning of the show it was incredibly daunting meeting two people who are the face of such an important culinary show but you quickly learn that they are both remarkably kind and supportive.\n\nQ Do you ever cheat and use pre-made stuff? Things like Bisto, mash and chopped onions?\n\nA Sometimes if I can\u2019t be bothered to make a reduction or a sauce I might be forced to use a bit of Bisto.\n\nQ What do you cook when you are hungover?\n\nA I\u2019m very happy to order on a hangover! But if I have to... it\u2019d be pancakes.\n\nQ What is they strangest thing you have ever eaten?\n\nA Alligator.\n\nQ What would be your ultimate cooking ambition?\n\nA Installing my passion for healthy food in my children.\n\nQ What\u2019s your best cooking tip or hack?\n\nA Buy a meat thermometer.\n\nNeil \u2018Razor\u2019 Ruddock, 51 - Former footballer\n\nQ What are John and Gregg really like?\n\nA Gregg absolutely loves his flavours and is so enthusiastic. And with John there\u2019s no cutting corners \u2013 he\u2019d know if you were going out buying gravy granules! They both know how tough it is but they instilled in all of us that there\u2019s no such word as can\u2019t.\n\nQ What was your low point of the series?\n\nA When we finished filming. I enjoyed it so much I didn\u2019t want it to end. When I first started, I thought I was an all right cook. But there\u2019s so much more I could learn. If MasterChef was a school I\u2019d still be going there now.\n\nQ What is your worst culinary disaster?\n\nA After we had a new kitchen fitted and hand painted, I used our blender without the top on and it went absolutely everywhere.\n\nIt was a nightmare. There was bright orange mess on the ceilings, walls \u2013 a carrot and swede puree. Where I was standing, there was an outline of my body on the wall, it looked like a murder scene! My wife was not best pleased.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nQ What would you cook for a dinner party?\n\nA Pasta for starter, chicken kiev and pavlova.\n\nQ If you were an inmate on death row, what would your final meal be?\n\nA Pie and mash.\n\nQ What would be your ultimate cooking ambition?\n\nA To team up with my wife. I\u2019m such a fan of street food so I\u2019d like a proper posh food van. I\u2019d love a 1970s food van with dishes like meatballs, pastas, kievs and liver.\n\nAnd all those comforting desserts \u2013 angel delight, rice puddings with homemade jams!\n\nQ What are your fears before tonight\u2019s final?\n\nA I try not to panic and stay in control. John Torode is so good and trying to impress him was rather nerve-wracking.", "description": "Celebrity Masterchef finalists Greg Rutherford, Neil Ruddock and Vicky Pattison on hopes and fears ahead of big night", "authors": ["Mark Jefferies", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc", "Bbc Shine Tv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Masterchef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
