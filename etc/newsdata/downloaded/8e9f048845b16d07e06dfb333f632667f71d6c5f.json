Goods from EU countries that are not part of the Airbus consortium, such as Italy would still be targeted, a USTR official said, because European Union nations all bear responsibility for the situation.\n\nBroad selling amid worries over slowing global growth that had punished European stocks earlier on Wednesday accelerated as the ruling revived worries about damage to the already-ailing regional economy. The pan European STOXX 600 index finished down 2.7 per cent, its worst day since December 2018.\n\nAirbus shares closed down 2 per cent.\n\nWall Street's main indexes suffered their sharpest one-day declines in nearly six weeks on Wednesday after employment and manufacturing data suggested that the US-China trade war is taking an increasing toll on the US economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world's two largest planemakers have waged a war of attrition over subsidies at the WTO since 2004 in a dispute that has tested the trade policeman's influence and is expected to set the tone for competition from would-be rivals from China.\n\nThe WTO had already found that both Europe's Airbus and its US rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in the world's largest corporate trade dispute.\n\nThe global trade body is due to decide early next year on the level of annual tariffs the EU can impose on US imports.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said the decision would weigh on the European planemaker, which is one of Germany's largest industrial employers and is headquartered in France.\n\nBefore any tariffs can be imposed, the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body must formally adopt the arbiters' report in a process expected to take between 10 days and four weeks.\n\nIts next scheduled meeting is on October 28, but Washington's request could bring that forward to October 14.\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days worth of trade between Europe and the United States, importers led by US airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the US economy.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing US tariffs on steel and aluminium and a threat from US President Donald Trump to penalise EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration believes tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to US products.\n\nAirbus has said this would lead to a \"lose-lose\" trade war and has published a video stressing its contribution to the US industry through local assembly plants and 4000 direct jobs.\n\nNot all analysts see the WTO's aircraft subsidy row - with its thousands of pages of legal and aeronautical jargon - inflaming broader international trade tensions.\n\n\"In some ways it is a distinct issue from the rest of the Trump trade wars,\" said Constantine Fraser of UK research firm TS Lombard.\n\n\"I think the White House is going to be aggressive in pursuing this, but I don't think there is necessarily any kind of read-through from this to the prospect of tariffs on cars.\"\n\nReuters", "description": "A decision by the WTO pushes a 15-year dispute over illegal support for Airbus and Boeing to the centre of caustic world trade relations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_52/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/86b6541464384d2a7d1b96ff75206de5b7592941", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
