Since last week, the reelection campaign has sent out millions of emails and text-messages asking small donors to help fight back. The campaign said it had attracted 50,000 new givers in the 48 hours following the start of the investigation.\n\nThe party\u2019s cash on hand total is particularly substantial: Republicans pointed out that the $156 million figure is more than two times as much as former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at the same point in time before the 2012 election.\n\nThe RNC has consistently outraised the DNC by large margins this year, and the GOP committee had $53.8 million on hand at the end of August, compared to $8.2 million for the DNC. Four Democratic presidential candidates have released third-quarter fundraising numbers so far: Bernie Sanders ($25.3 million), Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), Kamala Harris ($11.6 million) and Cory Booker ($6 million).\n\nTrump\u2019s eye-popping third quarter shocked some Democrats who have been arguing that their party needs to do more to prepare for the general election, especially online. The president regularly pours millions into advertising on the internet, especially on Facebook: Trump spent $4.4 million on Facebook advertising alone over the last 90 days. The biggest Democratic group countering Trump online, Priorities USA Action, spent a quarter as much as the Trump campaign on Facebook during that time; other major Democratic organizations did not have major ad campaigns running on Facebook.\n\n\u201cDemocrats \u2014 especially Democratic outside groups \u2014 need to fill the void especially before we have a nominee, so that Trump does not use his massive war chest to define himself and the nominee before we know who that person is,\u201d said Patrick McHugh, executive director of Priorities USA.\n\nThe impeachment debate, McHugh said, will only make it more difficult for Demorats to break through to voters on messages that depart from the news of the day in Washington. \u201cIt makes it all the more imperative for us to continue communicating with voters in these states around health care and taxes and the economy. Because otherwise voters are not going to hear about the harm that Trump has done,\u201d McHugh said.\n\nThe bulk of Trump\u2019s online spending thus far has focused on acquiring new donors, not persuading voters to support his reelection in 2020. But Trump has built a highly sophisticated online fundraising machine, and Democrats fear he will soon spend the record sums he\u2019s raised on courting undecided voters in swing states \u2014 all before the Democratic Party decides on its nominee.\n\nRepublicans are also using their cash advantage to start a national field program now, with staffers being deployed to an array of swing states. The party is also investing in traditionally blue states the president is hoping to put into contention.\n\nThe Trump campaign and RNC have also begun a $10 million TV advertising effort aimed at highlighting former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine and at pressuring swing district Democrats who backed the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a statement, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said that \"boycotts from Hollywood liberals and Democrats\u2019 shameful attacks on private citizens\" had boosted GOP fundraising.\n\n\u201cWe are investing millions on the airwaves and on the ground to hold House Democrats accountable, highlight their obstruction, and take back the House and re-elect President Trump in 2020,\u201d McDaniel said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ab/ae/c30695a74270b4a6af1f20f456ae/191001-trump-rnc-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
