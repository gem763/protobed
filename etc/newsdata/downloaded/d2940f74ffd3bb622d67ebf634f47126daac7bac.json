Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said on Wednesday the United States could be facing a \u201cnational security disaster in the making\u201d after President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria ahead of Turkey\u2019s planned invasion of the region.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Graham appeared to respond to Trump\u2019s comments to reporters earlier on Wednesday that undermined the U.S.\u2019s longstanding alliance with Kurdish forces fighting the self-described Islamic State in Syria.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not angels,\u201d Trump said of the Kurds. The president also said the invasion of Syria is \u201cnot our problem,\u201d though Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to travel to Turkey on Wednesday to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nGraham, a frequent Trump cheerleader, urged the president to \u201cadjust his thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements, this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq,\u201d Graham wrote.\n\nI hope President Trump is right in his belief that Turkeys invasion of Syria is of no concern to us, abandoning the Kurds won\u2019t come back to haunt us, ISIS won\u2019t reemerge, and Iran will not fill the vacuum created by this decision. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nHowever, I firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nI worry we will not have allies in the future against radical Islam, ISIS will reemerge, & Iran\u2019s rise in Syria will become a nightmare for Israel.\n\n\n\nI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nThe statements by President Trump about Turkey\u2019s invasion being of no concern to us also completely undercut Vice President Pence and Sec. Pompeo\u2019s ability to end the conflict. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nTrump responded to Graham\u2019s comments during a joint press conference with the president of Italy, saying the South Carolina senator should \u201cfocus on [the] judiciary.\u201d\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers fighting other people\u2019s wars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to get out of the Middle East.\u201d\n\nGraham called Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d last week and said abandoning the U.S.\u2019s Kurdish allies would be \u201ca stain on America\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Monday to impose sanctions and visa bans on top members of the Turkish government as punishment for the country\u2019s offensive into Syria. The order came roughly a week after the president effectively greenlighted Turkey\u2019s invasion by withdrawing U.S. support for Kurdish allies. Trump also said Monday that a small garrison of U.S. troops would remain in Syria.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions have drawn widespread backlash from U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, world leaders and human rights groups.\n\n\u201cThis is a terribly unwise decision by the President to abandon our Kurdish allies, who have been our major partner in the fight against the Islamic State,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said in a statement last week.\n\nTrump has continued to stand by his decision, on Wednesday calling it \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRepublicans, Foreign Policy Experts Condemn Trump's Decision To Abandon Kurds\n\nTrump Signs Executive Order To Impose Sanctions On Turkey\n\nPresident Trump: Kurds Are \u2018No Angels\u2019\n\nLove HuffPost?
