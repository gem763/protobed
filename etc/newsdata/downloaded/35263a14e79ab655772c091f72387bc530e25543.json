You may take these declines in stride \u2014 after all, the Dow has returned 12% this year, while the S&P 500 has returned 18% (total returns include reinvested dividends). But this strong showing masks what has really been a recovery from the dismal fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nFactSet A 12-month chart gives a far different impression than the year-to-date gains for the benchmark indexes.\n\nFor 12 months through Oct. 3, the Dow was down 1.6%, and the S&P returned only 2.4%. This is because the indexes were down 11.8% and 13.5%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nAll this points to the utilities sector \u2014 the best performer in the S&P 500 over the past year. That may not be a surprise given the decline in interest rates, but the sector\u2018s performance over very long periods has been very good.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve again cuts long-term interest rates, dividend-paying utility stocks should have a fresh catalyst.\n\nHow tax-friendly is your state?\n\nConventional wisdom is that California is the worst state for taxes because it has the highest top income-tax rate. But that\u2019s too simple, because the top rate only applies to the relatively small number of households with annual income of more than $1 million. A Kiplinger\u2019s study that uses a model household that is neither rich nor poor rates the states for tax-friendliness. And by that method, California doesn\u2019t crack the top 10 for tax-unfriendliness.\n\nNarrowing down retirement choices\n\nCatey Hill once again suggests retirement cities to fit a MarketWatch reader\u2019s finances and interests. This time it\u2019s a person who wishes to live on Social Security in a small city on the coast. What\u2019s your advice?\n\nMaybe FIRE is the wrong goal\n\nChris Mamula suggests achieving a net worth of zero as the first step toward financial independence.\n\nRelated: Why we ditched the FIRE movement and couldn\u2019t be happier\n\nWhat worries this Blackstone co-founder\n\nBlackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman names five things investors should be concerned about in an interview with MarketWatch\u2019s Chris Matthews.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for \u201call-weather businesses\u201d to invest in, read how this fund manager finds them.\n\nReviewing Trump\u2019s economy\n\nRex Nutting looks at the ups and downs of the U.S. economy since President Trump took office, and MarketWatch readers add hundreds of comments, not all of which are strictly partisan. Join the conversation.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what economists have to say about Friday\u2019s closely watched jobs report and what might be behind the slowdown in wage growth.\n\nDrilling down, which cities have the fastest job growth? And where are wages rising the fastest?\n\nA big tech company in a sweet spot\n\nNeil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, argues that Microsoft MSFT, +0.90% is now a defensive stock.\n\nCutting commissions and disrupting an industry\n\nCharles Schwab\u2019s SCHW, +1.00% decision to eliminate most trading commissions on retail accounts was quickly followed by rivals TD Ameritrade AMTD, +0.85% and E-Trade ETFC, +0.46%. Schwab said its move was timed to coincide with the release of a new book by the company\u2019s founder. But it also comes amid a squeeze at its main profit center \u2014 interest income \u2014 which in turn led to 600 job cuts recently. This pressure on interest income is hitting all three companies, and their share prices have suffered accordingly over the past 12 months:\n\nFactSet Discount brokers\u2019 stocks have suffered as their interest income has been squeezed declining interest rates.\n\nBesides the damage to the discount brokers, some investment advisers are concerned that cutting the commissions may not be such a good thing for individual investors. Dozens of MarketWatch readers disagree.\n\nAn industry still on the upswing\n\nDespite some recent economic reports pointing to slower growth in the U.S., excellent numbers continue to come in for home builders.\n\nWant more from MarketWatch?
