All eyes are on the middleweight championship bout as current champion Robert Whittaker (20-4) fights in front of a home crowd against Israel Adesanya, who is undefeated on 17-0 and interim title holder.\n\nWhittaker was scheduled to fight Kelvin Gastelum in February, but an injury meant the fight was eventually cancelled.\n\nAdesanya did fight Gastelum and prevailed in what was arguably the fight of the year in April, triumphing over his American opponent at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. His sixth win maintained his 100 per cent record since joining the UFC. There will also be plenty of interest in the clash between Al Iaqinta and Dan Hooker who will face off in the co-main event.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Al Iaquinta versus New Zealand\u2019s own Dan Hooker, three rounds in the lightweight division. Expect a real back-and-forth contest. Here is Indy Sport's prediction for the big fight. Both Whittaker and Adesanya are incredibly versatile and dangerous, and the odds show this one is a \u2018pick \u2018em\u2019. The tall, rangy Adesanya is in the form of his life, having remarkably fought and won six times in just over a year since entering the UFC, and Whittaker\u2019s last bout \u2013 16 months ago \u2013 saw the Aussie take a lot of damage in his second consecutive win over middleweight monster Yoel Romero. That said, Gastelum \u2013 despite a distinct height and reach disadvantage \u2013 was able to land regularly and heavily on Adesanya earlier this year, and should have finished \u2018The Last Stylebender\u2019. Whittaker still has a shorter reach and height than his challenger this weekend, but not as severely as Gastelum. \u2018The Reaper\u2019 is also quicker and more well-rounded than Gastelum. Given Gastelum was able to damage \u2018Stylebender\u2019 as much as he did when the pair met, the experienced Whittaker should be able to inflict enough of an assault on his opponent to leave Marvel Stadium with his belt still around his waist. Expect a war, though.\n\nPlease allow a moment for updates to load\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThe event will be shown live on BT Sport 1, the BT Sport App and BTSport.com for subscribers.\n\nPrediction\n\nBoth Whittaker and Adesanya are incredibly versatile and dangerous, and the odds show this one is a \u2018pick \u2018em\u2019.
