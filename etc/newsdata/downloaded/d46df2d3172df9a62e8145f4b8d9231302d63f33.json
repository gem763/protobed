She covered her face with both hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving again. This time I\u2019m gonna stay and I\u2019m gonna burn in my house,\u201d she said on Sunday morning. \u201cPG&E has not learned anything? Are they trying to kill us?\u201d\n\nThe Kincade fire first erupted last Wednesday but doubled in size on Sunday, fueled by extreme wind conditions that saw gusts reaching over 100mph in some mountainous peaks. Authorities expanded evacuations throughout the week, extending them again throughout Sunday as the fire spread into the edges of the small towns of Windsor and Healdsburg. By Sunday evening, more than 185,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes, while the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) utility cut power to millions of people in an effort to prevent its wind-damaged equipment from sparking further blazes.\n\nFor many Sonoma county residents, Sunday\u2019s horror came in its unsettling similarity to the devastating 2017 North Bay firestorm that killed 44 people, destroyed thousands of homes and burned roughly 245,000 acres \u2013 a recent, ravaging trauma from which so many are still attempting to recover.\n\nThe Kincade fire remained a fraction of that size.\n\nCoffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is deep in the midst of rebuilding after it was all but destroyed in 2017. Freshly painted new homes stand next to naked wood frames, next to still empty lots, dry lumber piled on gravel. One homeowner evacuated with a hose still spraying over the fresh wood chips in their front yard.\n\nWith smoke from the fire bearing down, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated by Sunday morning, but Ken Herland stood outside, watering his yard and the new wooden fence surrounding it with a garden hose. Herland has only lived in this house since July.\n\n\u201cWe just put a new metal roof on the house,\u201d he said as he worked the hose. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I left the last time.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cThis time feels worse.\u201d\n\nThis time is, objectively, not worse, and the large evacuation zones and many repeated warnings left residents far more time to prepare and leave before danger approached.\n\nHerland\u2019s daughter Jessica evacuated the horses at her ranch by the Pepperwood Preserve, which by Sunday was burning in places. She watched a neighbor\u2019s video of the fire on her phone.\n\n\u201cThe ranch isn\u2019t on fire yet,\u201d she reported back. \u201cSo far, we\u2019re looking good. I\u2019ll be hopeful until they tell me not to be.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Kincade Fire approaches a herd of alpacas in Sonoma county, California, on Sunday.

Two CalFire firefighters filled their truck\u2019s tank from a hydrant. By early afternoon, the fire would push to the outskirts of the town, where hundreds of firefighters worked to protect homes from spreading embers.\n\nFurther south on Sunday, evacuees had gathered at the Sonoma county fairgrounds, a temporary shelter and incident command for firefighters who had traveled from across the state, and the country, to fight the Kincade. The site was littered with stacks of hay bales and multicolored pumpkins in anticipation of a weekend Halloween event and petting zoo, since cancelled. Instead, the grounds were overflowing with evacuees who had nowhere else to go.\n\nNew temporary residents watched the smoke billow up over town as the winds set the fire swirling at the edge of Windsor. The corrugated metal roofing on a barn building lifted and slammed down again with each gust.\n\nMichele Cochrane said she had evacuated her Camp Meeker home over 15 miles west of here to the sound of a second world war air raid siren, after officials had extended evacuation lines to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\u201cWe were in the middle of dinner and there it blasts. The fire\u2019s not even close to us, and yet we have to go through this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just loaded everything up and came on in. But now I\u2019m glad we did because if you look at where the wind went, if there are any embers that way \u2026\u201d she trailed off, shaking her head.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fire damage is seen from the air in the Coffey Park neighborhood in Santa Rosa, California, after the 2017 wildfire.

She, her two sons and a roommate, along with two cats and two dogs were set up with cots and cages in the corner of a county fairgrounds building. A chicken was staying with a friend nearby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather them do it this way than be like, knocking on people\u2019s doors at three in the morning,\u201d said her son John.\n\n\u201cAs much as we all really, really, really want to go home, we\u2019re staying until tomorrow morning. But then that\u2019s it,\u201d said Cochrane \u2013 they would be going back, past the evacuation lines. \u201cAnd I know the way.\n\n\u201cWest county is a hearty bunch of people. We survive,\u201d she said.\n\nThere is much to survive across Sonoma county, between the wild fires, the floods, and now, the rolling PG&E blackouts. As the sun set over the city, luminous gold and purple through the growing cloud of smoke, the new residents walked their dogs, ate tacos, chatted in the waning warmth of the evening.\n\nAnd then most of the region was again plunged into darkness.", "description": "The wind-fanned Kincade wildfire doubled in size on Sunday, threatening the north Bay area where 44 people died two years ago", "authors": ["Susie Cagle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94377fe84e74b5ae2aab6983f616ba3ac4615dc6/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=009a2b133fd67fb46a7954e8f53a770f", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
