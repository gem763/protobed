And Brite the Light Bulb, a U.S. Navy energy efficiency apostle. And the Green Reaper, an Energy Department mascot who even with a fear-mongering name and a rather scary visage is deployed to schools to encourage energy conservation.\n\nAnd it all comes at a cost \u2014 more than $250,000 spent in recent years with one Ohio-based costume company, according to Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican who says it\u2019s time to undress the government\u2019s lavish spending.\n\nHer target this time is the $1.4 billion the government spends each year on advertising and public relations campaigns \u2014 twice the amount dedicated to breast cancer research, for example.\n\n\u201cAs an Iowa State Cyclone fan, I\u2019ll be the first to say that mascots can be fun. But there is no justification for spending a quarter of a million dollars in taxpayer money on mascots and millions more on swag,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThese costs come at the expense of real national priorities.\u201d\n\nOther things taxpayers have shelled out for, in the name of Uncle Sam\u2019s self promotion, are coloring books ($605,000), key chains ($60,000) and drink koozies ($17,000). Another $25,000 went to buy give-away stress balls, and $16,000 for fidget spinners \u2014 2017\u2019s ridiculous summertime craze.\n\nMs. Ernst\u2019s bill, the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government Act \u2014 or SWAG Act \u2014 would ban the use of taxpayers\u2019 money on creating or using a mascot for self-promotion.\n\nMilitary mascots would be exempt, which is probably a relief to Bill the Goat, the U.S. Naval Academy\u2019s man in a costume.\n\nThe SWAG act would also ban distribution of swaggy giveaways, right down to stickers, stuffed animals and writing pens.\n\nPublic relations waste is by no means a new phenomenon, according to Ms. Ernst, whose office compiled a greatest hits list of questionable spending.\n\nIn one notorious incident flagged by an inspector general, the State Department during the Obama years shelled out $630,000 to pay for \u201cghost\u201d followers on Facebook.\n\nThe audit found that while some of the followers may have clicked on an ad or \u201cliked\u201d a department post, they had \u201cno real interest in the topic and have never engaged further.\u201d\n\nMs. Ernst \u2014 who won election five years ago with a famous ad recounting her youth castrating pigs on an Iowa farm, and her vow to bring those skills to Washington to make bureaucrats squeal \u2014 said not all PR spending is bad.\n\nNot only does the military need to promote itself for recruitment, but public health campaigns can warn of potential epidemics or safety risks.\n\nIt\u2019s the spending that appears to have little obvious value to the taxpayer, like a $30,000 NASA Martian-themed party, that irks her.\n\nThat NASA party featured a sci-fi costume contest.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful the Agriculture Department\u2019s Sammy Soil \u2014 a government mascot for the last 40 years \u2014 would have been able to compete.\n\nSame goes for Franklin, Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Fair Housing Fox \u2014 though his dance moves have garnered a few dozen views on YouTube.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
