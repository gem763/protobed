Euronews has taken a look, below.\n\nLast time out, in 2015, the right-wing coalition (\"Portugal Ahead, a coalition between the Social Democratic Party and the People's Party) won the most votes, but it was toppled after 11 days by the anti-austerity Socialist leader Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who governed in an alliance with other left-wing parties (the Left Bloc, the Communist Party, and the Greens).\n\nPolls suggest that on Sunday the Socialists will win the most seats but will fail to secure a parliamentary majority.\n\nRead more: Portugal elections: is it the end of the 'contraption' left-wing coalition?\n\nThe Portuguese political scene has been dominated by the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party since the 1974 Carnation Revolution, although the People's Party has been present in some governments.\n\nThis is how Portugal's parliament looked after the 2015 general election: Social Democratic Party (89 MPs), the Socialist Party (86 MPs), the People's Party (18 MPs), the Communist Party (17 MPs), the Left Bloc(19 MPs), and the People-Animals-Nature (1 MPs).\n\nThe Social Democratic Party (PSD)\n\nREUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\nLeader: Rui Rio\n\nThe name is misleading: the Social Democratic Party is a right-wing party, close to other European centre-right parties such as the British Conservatives, the Spanish PP, or the German CDU. It is the main opposition party and its leader, Rui Rio, is also the leader of the opposition.\n\nIt was founded in 1974, soon after the revolution, by figures of the \"liberal wing\" of the fascist regime such as Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro, Francisco Pinto Balsem\u00e3o and Joaquim Magalh\u00e3es Mota.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party has previously joined coalitions with electoral purposes, such as the AD - Democratic Alliance (PPD / PSD, CDS and PPM) between 1979 and 1981.\n\nThe People's Party (CDS)\n\nLeader: Assun\u00e7\u00e3o Cristas\n\nThe People's Party is a traditional Christian Democrat party, very similar to the German CSU.\n\nIt is to the right of the PSD and was also founded after the revolution.\n\nA strong advocate of social and religious conservatism, the People's Party was the only party that voted against the approval of a socialist constitution in 1976. It went into a more populist right-wing phase in the 1990s and early 2000s and has since returned to its centrist Christian Democrat roots.\n\nIt was named \"Party of the Social Democratic Center\" with the acronym CDS until 1981, when the name \"People's Party\" was added.\n\nThe Socialists (Partido Socialista, PS)\n\nREUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nLeader: Current Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who is seeking re-election.\n\nThe PS is a social-democratic party like the British Labour Party, the German SPD or the Spanish PSOE.\n\nIt was founded in 1973, before the Revolution, in Bad M\u00fcnstereifel, West Germany by M\u00e1rio Soares, one of the main opponents of the fascist regime, and by other personalities, through the transformation of the Portuguese Socialist Action which emerged in 1964.\n\nSocialist Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates (2005-2011) was arrested in Lisbon in 2014 on charges of corruption, tax evasion and money laundering, becoming the first head of government in the history of the country to face such accusations. He went to prison and remains under house arrest.\n\nUnitarian Democratic Coalition (CDU)\n\nLeader: Jer\u00f3nimo de Sousa\n\nThe Unitarian Democratic Coalition (CDU) is an electoral and political coalition between the Portuguese Communist Party (Partido Comunista Portugu\u00eas or PCP) and the Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"(Partido Ecologista \"Os Verdes\" or PEV).\n\nThe Communist Party\n\nThe Portuguese Communist Party is a left-wing party founded in 1921 as the Portuguese Section of the Communist International (Comintern). It played a major role in the opposition to the Salazar regime.\n\nThe Communist Party still enjoys popularity in vast sectors of Portuguese society, particularly in the rural areas of Alentejo and Ribatejo and also in the heavily industrialized areas around Lisbon and Set\u00fabal.\n\nThe Greens (Os Verdes)\n\nLeader: Helo\u00edsa Apol\u00f3nia\n\nOs Verdes is an eco-socialist party and a member of the European Greens.\n\nIt has had a close relationship with the Communist Party since its foundation in 1982.\n\nIt also edits a newspaper named Folha Verde.\n\nThe Left Bloc (Bloco de Esquerda, BE)\n\nLeader: Catarina Martins\n\nThe Left Bloc (Bloco de Esquerda, BE) is a left-wing party founded in 1999.\n\nCatarina Martins isn't exactly the party leader but more of a spokesperson for its six-member Permanent Commission.\n\nThe party is made up of several groups that remain separate political associations and retain some level of autonomy.\n\nOther parties\n\nPeople-Animals-Nature / Leader: Andr\u00e9 Silva\n\nAlian\u00e7a / Leader: Pedro Santana Lopes\n\nChega / Leader: Andr\u00e9 Ventura\n\nIniciativa Liberal / Leader: Carlos Guimar\u00e3es Pinto\n\nPartido Nacional Renovador / Leader: Jos\u00e9 Pinto-Coelho\n\nPartido Democr\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablicano / Leader: Marinho e Pinto\n\nPartido Comunista dos Trabalhadores / Leader: Arnaldo Matos\n\nPortugueses Partido Popular Mon\u00e1rquico / Leader: Paulo Est\u00eav\u00e3o\n\nPartido Trabalhista Portugu\u00eas / Leader: Am\u00e2ndio Madaleno\n\nLivre / Leader: Collective leadership\n\nReagir Incluir e Reciclar / Leader: Vitorino Silva\n\nPartido da Terra / Leader: Jos\u00e9 In\u00e1cio Faria\n\nPartido Unido dos Reformados e Pensionistas / Leader: Ant\u00f3nio Mateus Dias & Fernando Loureiro\n\nN\u00d3S, Cidad\u00e3os! / Leader: Mendo Castro Henriques\n\nMovimento Alternativa Socialista / Leader: Gil Garcia\n\nJuntos pelo Povo / Leader: \u00c9lvio Sousa", "description": "Portugal is holding its general election on October 6, with more than 20 political forces in the running.
