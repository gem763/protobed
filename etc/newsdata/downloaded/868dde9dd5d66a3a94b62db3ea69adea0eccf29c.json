The rookie drove in four runs and scored three times.\n\n\u201cI did know my dad had one,\u201d Cavan Biggio said. \u201cI have a ticket to the game he got it in in my room my whole life. I didn\u2019t think I was going to get up there for the opportunity.\u201d\n\nHe got his first hit off Chandler Shepherd, the second against Shawn Armstrong, the third versus Richard Bleier and the last off Mychal Givens.\n\nCraig Biggio hit for the cycle at Colorado\u2019s Coors Field on April 8, 2002, as part of a career that earned him induction into the Hall of Fame. He led off with a single against Denny Neagle, then tripled and homered off Neagle before doubling versus. Mike James in the eighth.\n\nThe only other father-son duo in major league history to hit for the cycle was Gary Ward for Minnesota at Milwaukee on Sept. 19, 1980, and Daryle Ward for Pittsburgh at St. Louis on May 26, 2004.\n\nCavan Biggio became the first player to hit for the cycle for Toronto since Jeff Fry against Texas on Aug. 17, 2001, and the first opponent to accomplish the feat in the 27-year history of Camden Yards.\n\n\u201cThat was a crazy scene,\u201d Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. \u201cThe whole dugout was cheering for him. A triple is hard to get in this ballpark. He was really going all out rounding second. He\u2019s aggressive at the plate and he\u2019s really doing better.\u201d\n\nTrey Mancini and Jonathan Villar homered for last-place Baltimore, which lost for the third time in four games and dropped to 49-102.\n\nMancini finished with four RBIs. He hit his 34th homer in the first and snapped a tie with a run-scoring single off Justin Shafer in the seventh.\n\n\u201cI think everybody wants to finish the year strong,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cIt sounds clich\u00e9 but it\u2019s honestly what I think about when I go up to the plate is to do what I can to help the team win and try to have a good at-bat.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Jays tied the game again when Biggio doubled, stole third and scored on a sacrifice fly by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. in the eighth.\n\nJustin Smoak put Toronto ahead when homered off Givens (2-6) leading off the ninth, Smoak\u2019s 21st homer and first since Aug. 27.\n\nBiggio tacked on two more runs with a triple to before an error by Villar at shortstop allowed the eighth run to score.\n\nDerek Law (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth inning.\n\nRandal Grichuk hit his 10th homer in 26 games against Baltimore.\n\nVillar hit his 22nd home run off Ken Giles in the ninth.\n\nOrioles manager Brandon Hyde was not happy about several gaffes his team made on the bases and defensively.\n\n\u201cI feel like for the most part this year we\u2019ve competed our tails off. Just fell short quite a few times,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cI just thought we made a lot of mistakes tonight. I thought we played like a really tired team. We need better effort.\u201d\n\nREED\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens safety and NFL Hall of Famer Ed Reed threw out a ceremonial first pitch - a strike down the middle. Reed also handled grounders at shortstop during Orioles batting practice.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: RHP Jordan Romano (elbow) is expected to throw Wednesday and could pitch this weekend if there are no setbacks, according to Montoyo.\n\nOrioles: DH Mark Trumbo was scratched because of neck and back tightness but was available off the bench. \u2026 INF Renato N\u00fa\u00f1ez was hit by a pitch in his left hand Monday in Detroit and was not in the lineup. . CF Mason Williams crashed headfirst into the wall on Biggio\u2019s triple but did not show any signs of a concussion, Hyde said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jays: RHP Clay Buchholz (1-5, 5.63 ERA) is 1-3 with a 4.47 ERA since returning from a shoulder injury Aug. 25. He is 11-7 with a 3.76 ERA over 23 games (20 starts) against the Orioles but is facing them for the first time since 2016.\n\nOrioles: RHP Dylan Bundy (6-14, 4.99 ERA) was pushed back a day and will make his team-leading 29th start. Bundy is 1-0 with a 2.25 ERA in two starts against Toronto this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cavan Biggio hit for the cycle, just like his dad.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Todd Karpovich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/blue_jays_orioles_baseball_69161_c0-212-5068-3166_s1770x1032.jpg?d5d07d457013ec9549577f859c7bf8b0a8b4a5e8", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
