The mass rallies were sparked by Spain\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s Monday ruling that sentenced nine Catalan pro-independence top brass to jail terms between nine and 13 years over their roles in the failed 2017 independence bid.\n\nUnrest is gripping #Barcelona, as well as other cities, for the third consecutive day https://t.co/oTN32Sb9fppic.twitter.com/ISUnxEVK5C \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 16, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, the demonstrators were seen throwing hundreds of white paper toilet rolls into the air during the gathering in central Barcelona. The bizarre performance meant \u201cthere is a lot that needs cleaning up,\u201d according to the protest organizers.\n\nRiot police were also dispatched to the scene en-masse. Law enforcement officers have been pelted with various projectiles as well, and scuffles between protesters and police have erupted multiple times.\n\nVenting their anger and trying to draw attention to their cause, the protesters also destroyed road signs and set improvised barricades alight.\n\nThe police, in turn, repeatedly charged at the protesters with batons drawn, and were also seen shooting at the crowds and in the air with pump-action shotguns and larger-caliber devices. The latter resembled the notorious \u2018Flash-Ball\u2019 launchers that left many maimed during the Yellow Vests protests in France.\n\n#Barcelona protest: Police were seen shooting at the crowds and in the air with pump-action shotguns https://t.co/oTN32Sb9fppic.twitter.com/T9lQ1pXAzI \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 16, 2019\n\nIt was not immediately clear what ammunition the law enforcement used. Several protesters were apparently injured and were seen being led away by their comrades while visibly limping.\n\nMore than 200 people have been reported injured over the past two days in Barcelona and other cities throughout Catalonia. On Tuesday, protesters occupied and later clashed with police at Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport, which led to the cancellation of multiple flights.\n\nThe Spanish government blamed \u201ccoordinated groups\u201d of protesters for the violence on the streets. Madrid said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t rule out any scenario\u201d and vowed to keep the order in Catalonia by any means it sees fit, yet with \u201cfirmness and proportionality.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Catalonia \u2018separatists\u2019 bad, HK \u2018pro-democracy protesters\u2019 good: Orwell\u2019s 1984 becomes user\u2019s manual for Western \u2018free media\u2019\n\nSuch statements might signal that the central government is readying for a widespread crackdown on pro-independence Catalan protesters. The 2017 failed independence referendum was met with an overwhelming police response that left hundreds of people injured.\n\nChaotic scenes with the police smashing into polling stations, snatching ballot boxes and plainly beating up people partaking in the vote, drew widespread condemnation from international humanitarian groups at the time.\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "Defying Madrid\u2019s demand to \u201cfirmly\u201d keep order, supporters of jailed Catalan pro-independence leaders launched a fresh rally in Barcelona.
