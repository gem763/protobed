It\u2019s all in the irony of trauma.\n\nJosh argues that while Joker is traumatic, it prompts change (Picture: DC Comics)\n\n\u2018A fine line between the resentment of wanting to hurt society back for raping you of a decent life, for not protecting you, and accepting what feels like alien feelings with softening to those others who seem freakish in our era of judgment, and digital damnation.\u2019\n\n\u2018Like kids in Middle School,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Man, they can just be mean. For no reason.\n\n\u2018And, sometimes, those awful little clicky kids breed an evil in someone that rages much later, when everyone pretends we are all back to normal, when we all thought it had just manned up and gone away.\u2019\n\nJosh concluded his statement by saying: \u2018We have a habit of hating and ostracizing and dividing and sweeping our problems under the rug.\n\n\u2018Joker, is simply lifting the rug and looking underneath it. Nothing more. Nothing less. It\u2019s there.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalk The Line star Joaquin has reportedly been tipped for an Oscar for his portrayal of Batman\u2019s enemy in the movie.\n\nJoker acts as an origins story for Joker set in 1981 and it follows failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck, who turns to a life of crime in Gotham City.\n\nWarner Bros, the studio behind the film, has defended it, saying \u2018neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
