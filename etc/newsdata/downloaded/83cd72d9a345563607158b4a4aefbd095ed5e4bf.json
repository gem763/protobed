New Caledonian crows have been observed turning twigs into hooks to catch prey. Dolphins use toys to capture the attention of humans. Octopuses have used discarded coconut shells as armor. Sea otters use stones to crack open shellfish. Elephants have been seen using logs and rocks to cover watering holes. Gorillas use sticks to measure the depth of rivers and ponds.\n\nRoot-Bernstein observed one pig try the spatula out on two separate occasions, but sticks seemed to be their preferred helper.\n\nTool use has long been considered a major milestone in animal intelligence.\n\n'It brings us closer to animals, and helps us realize it's all connected,' Root-Bernstein told National Geographic.", "description": "An ecologist at a zoo in Paris has observed an endangered species of pig using tools for the first time ever, something scientists consider one of the major signs of developed intelligence in animals.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19316806-0-image-a-23_1570225913006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
