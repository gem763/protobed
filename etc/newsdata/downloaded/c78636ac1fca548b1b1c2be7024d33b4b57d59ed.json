Moriyama lived in Kyoto city before dying in March at age 90.\n\nKansai Electric concluded in a report of its internal probe released last Wednesday that the three former vice presidents did not breach internal rules and their behavior was not inappropriate.\n\nA total of 20 people at the Osaka-based utility are known to have been given cash and gifts, including shopping coupons and gold coins, worth 318.45 million yen over a number of years by Moriyama, former deputy mayor of Takahama which has heavily relied on Kansai Electric's nuclear plant economically.\n\nThe recipients revealed initially were mostly those in the nuclear power business but the recent additional disclosure shows those in other operations were involved in the gifting.\n\nThe three were among the 20 people revealed by Kansai Electric to have received gifts. The company declined to disclose the names of the three.\n\nSix of the 20 people, meanwhile, returned gifts worth 159.08 million yen in February last year, shortly after tax authorities launched a formal investigation, sources familiar with the matter said Saturday.\n\nThe six included Chairman Makoto Yagi and then-Executive Vice President Hideki Toyomatsu, the sources said. The gifts were returned after the Kanazawa Taxation Regional Bureau opened an investigation in January last year into Yoshida Kaihatsu.\n\nThe widening money scandal has re-exposed collusion between Japan's nuclear industry and government officials. At a press conference on Wednesday, Yagi disclosed that Moriyama began offering even more gifts following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan, which triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis.\n\nOut of the 318.45 million yen, Toyomatsu, who was head of the utility's nuclear power division, received one of the biggest sums -- 110.57 million yen.\n\nThe taxation bureau found that Yoshida Kaihatsu had created slush funds by booking fictitious subcontracting fees and had provided a 300 million yen commission to Moriyama.\n\nThe bureau searched Moriyama's home several months after beginning its probe and found a large amount of cash and gifts, with memos confirming the six had returned them.\n\nThe authorities verified that the six had received some 180 million yen in total, of which a portion has not been returned.\n\nYagi said at the press conference that they returned the gifts when they did because \"it became an environment in which (Moriyama) would accept them.\"\n\nThe utility said the executives had been trying to return the gifts but could not as Moriyama had refused to accept them and became angry.\n\nMoriyama was deeply involved in the bidding process and construction of the Nos. 3 and 4 reactors at the Takahama nuclear plant, which began operation in 1985, according to Kansai Electric. He served as deputy mayor from 1977 to 1987.\n\nAfter retiring from the municipal government, he worked for Kanden Plant Corp, a subsidiary of the utility.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Managers of Kansai Electric Power Co's Kyoto branch received gifts worth 2.6 million yen from a former town official and allowed the office to place orders with a construction company that had close links to the official without the bidding process, the utility said.
