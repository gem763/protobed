It may apply a cheese grater to the nation\u2019s partisan wounds. The process may be conducted foolishly. It may feed a Republican thirst for revenge against a future Democratic president. It may motivate Trump\u2019s base to salivating enthusiasm. The broad, American middle may yawn and switch to ESPN.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll of this matters, especially if it increases the chances of Trump\u2019s reelection. But it matters like a fate, not like a choice. In T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cMurder in the Cathedral,\u201d a priest says of unfolding events, \u201cLet the wheel turn.\u201d Archbishop Thomas Becket later comments: \u201cThe fool, fixed in his folly, may think/ He can turn the wheel on which he turns.\u201d\n\nNo one in our unfolding drama can now turn the wheel on which they turn. Trump\u2019s clearly impeachable offense has given the partisan instincts of elected Democrats the added justification of principle. The whistleblower complaint has affirmed those concerns and expanded their scope. This makes the process of impeachment inevitable. Now the actors are merely choosing what roles they will play.\n\nTrump\u2019s role is to push and push until he meets firm resistance to his abuse of power \u2014 something he has rarely experienced. Note that Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky came during the denouement of the investigation of Russian influence. According to the readout, Trump said: \u201cAs you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsider this a moment. Trump gloated about beating the charge that he conspired with a foreign government to win an election, during a call in which he proposed to conspire with a foreign government to win reelection. The man is immune to ethical instruction. And further, Trump thought that releasing the readout of the call would somehow be exculpatory. He has spent so many years in the trash heap of corruption that he can no longer recognize the stench.\n\nBecause Trump tests boundaries of morality and legality, his defenders are, in effect, calling on Americans to ratify those changes. By all the evidence, Trump believes that politics, stripped of pretense, is the dirty, unethical pursuit of power, which is properly used to destroy your enemies. Republicans who defend or excuse him are providing permission for his radical redesign of public life. This is perhaps the saddest result of Trump\u2019s corruption: turning good men and women into the bodyguards of a petty, cruel, lawless, would-be autocrat.\n\nBecause Trump has chosen to be transparently corrupt, congressional Republicans cannot dispute the facts of the case (as they did during special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation). They may still insist: No quid pro quo . But this is more of a rally chant than an argument. Trump\u2019s request for foreign help to win the 2020 election was not like Belgium asking Uruguay for a favor. It was a global superpower asking a country dependent on U.S. military aid \u2014 which had just been withheld in a \u201creview\u201d \u2014 for favors. Trump pointedly reminded Zelensky that \u201cthe United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine.\u201d Trump\u2019s requests were made in an atmosphere of menace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the transcript, Trump\u2019s first request concerns the \u201cCrowdStrike\u201d investigation of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s security breach during the 2016 campaign. Conspiracy theorists allege that the inquiry was an elaborate hoax to fake a breach and that the evidence is contained in a computer server somewhere in Ukraine. Evidently the president of the United States believes this as well. His request will be long remembered at the State Department as one of the most incomprehensible and asinine of American diplomatic history.\n\nTrump\u2019s main request \u2014 a joint Ukrainian/U.S. Justice Department/Rudolph W. Giuliani investigation of Biden\u2019s (falsely) alleged role in preventing the Ukrainian prosecution of his son \u2014 is nearly as strange and specious. But it was made by the most visible representative of America, speaking in the name of the American people.\n\nThe American people will ultimately decide if this disturbs or bores them. Whatever the outcome, the wheel has begun to turn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more from Michael Gerson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook .\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: The acting director of national intelligence just showed how corrupt the Trump administration is\n\nJennifer Rubin: The \u2018perfect\u2019 call \u2014 and those dense enough to say so\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The Trump-Zelensky readout is a devastating indictment of our president\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
