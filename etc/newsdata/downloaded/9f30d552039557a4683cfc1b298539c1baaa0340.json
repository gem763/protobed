Early in his presidency, for example, Trump made headlines with a very ambitious claim that his administration would cut regulations by 75 percent. The statement may have been hyperbole \u2014 intended more to signal a desire to reduce burdens on business than an actual goal \u2014 but it nonetheless raises interesting questions. If an administration really did want to cut regulations by 75 percent, or even 10 or 20 percent, how would it go about doing that? How does one measure regulation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor too long, regulations have escaped scrutiny because researchers and policymakers didn\u2019t have good ways to measure them. Finally, that\u2019s all beginning to change.\n\nEconomists have experimented with different regulation measures over the years: page counts, agency budgets, and the number of steps it takes to start a business have all been used. No metric is perfect, and each has its own advantages and drawbacks.\n\nSince 2012, the Mercatus Center has been taking a different approach by using machine learning and text analysis to analyze the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, part of a project we call RegData. Parsing legal text, RegData technology identifies restrictive terms such as \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d \u201cmay not,\u201d \u201cprohibited\u201d and \u201crequired\u201d (i.e., regulations).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe RegData software also uses machine-learning algorithms to map each restriction to the particular industries and sectors of the economy it is likely to affect. To date, RegData has been used in numerous peer-reviewed academic journal articles, casting light on the causes and effects of regulation in ways never before possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Mercatus has completed an analysis of state-level regulation. State RegData 1.0 analyzes the administrative codes of 46 states plus the District of Columbia, and the results are informative. The average state has 131,000 restrictive terms and about 9 million words in its code, which would require roughly twelve work weeks to read at a normal reading pace.\n\nBut there is huge variation. The least regulated state is South Dakota, with about 44,000 regulatory restrictions, while the most regulated state is California, with 395,000. All told, the least regulated states are South Dakota, Alaska, Montana, Idaho, and North Dakota, while the most regulated states are California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, and Texas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to include Vermont, New Jersey, Arkansas, and Hawaii. Arkansas is the easiest to explain: It has no administrative code, at least not yet. Its state agencies produce regulations, but until this year no one had ever bothered to compile them in one place. Fortunately \u2014 perhaps partly in response to RegData \u2014 legislation was passed this year to create an official Code of Arkansas Rules by January 2023, so Arkansas\u2019s regulatory landscape will eventually come to light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew Jersey and Vermont have administrative codes, and the codes are freely available online for anyone to read, but they are managed by LexisNexis, a private company whose terms and conditions prohibit downloading the text. We tried repeatedly to get permission to analyze these public documents \u2014 which requires downloading them first \u2014 but the company never returned our calls or emails.\n\nFinally, Hawaii\u2019s online code is simply too disorganized to analyze for now. Each agency\u2019s rules are listed on a separate, unique website that would likely require writing a distinct computer program for each. Our hope is that these states will take action to make their codes more accessible to the public and to researchers in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite missing a few states, we\u2019ve learned a lot. For the most part, bigger, more populated states have more regulation. For example, many are surprised to learn that Texas is one of the most regulated states. Predictably, health and environmental regulations are among the dominant forms of state regulation \u2014 but in some cases, they\u2019re joined by things like occupational-licensing regulations. And there is less regulation in some areas than one might expect. For example, non-health care-related insurance-industry regulation, which is primarily a state responsibility, seems to be relatively light.\n\nWith all this regulation on the books, it\u2019s not surprising that many states are taking decisive action to streamline their codes, in some cases using RegData. In Missouri, former governor Eric Greitens set a one-third reduction target for agencies and used restriction counts to measure progress. Most recently, Idaho leaders claim to have cut more than 19,000 restrictions when the state\u2019s old regulatory code expire d on July 1. Expiration dates can be powerful tools for reducing regulatory burdens. Indeed, one of Trump\u2019s executive orders last week gives agencies 120 days to review all the various guidance documents and policy memoranda they issue. Any mandates they want to keep will have to move into a new online database; everything else will expire.\n\nThese examples also highlight the importance of measurement when cutting red tape. President Trump\u2019s goal of a 75 percent reduction may seem unrealistic, but other jurisdictions have cut regulatory requirements by as much as 50 percent without a dropoff in public health or safety. This leaves no question that large reductions in regulatory burdens are achievable so long as reformers have a clear measure of success. Now they finally have one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Broughel is a senior research fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and an adjunct professor of law at the Antonin Scalia Law School.
