Mann in The Contender, The Story of Marlon Brando, published by Harper.\n\nBrando needed different girlfriends for different days of the week.\n\nHe slept with the wives of his friends, parked his car around the corner, scaled the fence and snuck in the back way \u2013 believing married women were even more exciting to pursue.\n\nHe\u2019d say he\u2019d be faithful but he never could stop his tom-catting. But Brando didn't restrict himself to women.\n\nAnd he wasn't a guilt-ridden homosexual but utterly at ease with sleeping either sex.\n\nGirls and boys, straight and gay were besotted with Brando who exuded raw sexuality from an early age writes William J. Mann in The Contender, The Story of Marlon Brando\n\nAccording to several sources Brando and Marilyn had a romance in 1955 following the divorce from Joe DiMaggio and before her marriage to Arthur Miller\n\n\u2018To say that he was a great lover\u2019, said actress Rita Moreno, \u2018sensual, generous, delightfully inventive' would be gravely understating what he did'\n\nAfter his death, lovers came out of the woodwork: Richard Pryor\u2019s widow claimed the comedian had an affair with the actor as did record producer Quincy Jones\n\nGirls and boys, straight and gay were besotted with Bud who exuded raw sexuality from an early age.\n\nWhile at Shattuck Military academy, Bud slept with another young man on campus.\n\n\u2018The relationship was nothing extraordinary; sexual play between cadets at military schools was not uncommon\u2019, writes Mann.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s say sex has no sex\u2019, Brando later stated acknowledging sex with men.\n\nLiving was sex with whom and when you wanted \u2013 girls, gay men and he preferred inconsequential sex and took advantage of it.\n\nOccasionally escaping the city for Provincetown, an artist colony out on the tip of Cape Cod where \u2018gender and sex were rather fluid\u2019, Marlon slept with men.\n\nBack in New York, he was juggling three girlfriends: the tall willowy Ellen Adler, Celia, a window dresser who seemed like a mother substitute, and Blossom Plumb, a gorgeous petite blonde in Brando\u2019s acting class.\n\nBut even the merry-go-round got to him when he would walk through Grand Central Station and women would open their blouses and show him their breasts.\n\nThe petite, dark-eyed actress Rita Moreno met Brando on the 20th Century Fox lot when her star was on the rise and she was mesmerized by his perfume and found him \u2018swaggeringly irresistible\u2019.\n\nShe was his type \u2013 dark, vibrant, earthy, sensual and they quickly became lovers.\n\n\u2018To say that he was a great lover\u2019, Moreno revealed, \u2018sensual, generous, delightfully inventive \u2013 would be gravely understating what he did not only to my body but for my soul\u2019.\n\nHe awakened her political conscience but initially kept their relationship clandestine while he had a blistering affair with Josanne Mariani, a pretty 19- year old French girl and asked her to marry him which he had no intention of doing.\n\nAccording to several sources Brando and Marilyn had a romance in 1955 following her divorce from Joe DiMaggio and before her marriage to Arthur Miller in December of that year,\n\n\u2018Monroe was hardly Marlon\u2019s type but she had an earthy sense of humor that he would have liked\u2019, writes Mann.\n\nKnowing that he could seduce any woman he wanted, he did.\n\n\u2018I had a lot of affairs. Far too many to describe me as a perfectly normal, reasonable, intelligent person\u2019, Brando is quoted.\n\nJill Banner, an actress who met Brando when she had a bit part in the film, Candy, began a relationship with the actor, but their love affair suffered from Brando\u2019s multiple flings and her feeling that he was manipulative and selfish. There were rumors that she was also sleeping with his son, Christian.\n\nJill Banner (right, in film Spider Baby) met Brando when she had a bit part in the film, Candy, began a relationship with the actor, but their love affair suffered from Brando\u2019s multiple flings and her feeling that he was manipulative and selfish.\n\nWhen he thought he would reconnect with her, she was killed in an auto accident.\n\nHe later acknowledged that she was the only woman he really ever loved.\n\nAfter his death, lovers came out of the woodwork: Richard Pryor\u2019s widow claimed the comedian had an affair with the actor as did record producer Quincy Jones who was quoted as saying 'He'd f**k a mailbox.'\n\nMarlon Brando changed the way actors thought about their craft, but The Godfather star was never beloved because he was a rebel who thumbed his nose at Hollywood\n\n\u2018It was the 70s! Drugs were still good, especially quaaludes. If you did enough cocaine, you\u2019d f*ck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning\u2019, Pryor\u2019s widow, Jennifer Lee told TMZ.\n\nHe could never tell a woman he loved her \u2013 all thanks to his father who gave him no love and was \u2018a card-carrying pr*ck\u2019, a silent, brooding, angry man,\u2019 Mann writes.\n\nBrando never really escaped that trauma created by his father who beat him and his mother.\n\nHe was never exorcised from the post-traumatic stress that followed \u2013 despite years of psychotherapy.\n\nMarlon Brando Sr. \u2018was the golem that stomped across the geography of my psyche\u2019, Mann quotes Brando.\n\nBud, as Marlon was called, was born in Omaha in spring of 1924, but the family \u2013 along with his three older sisters --moved to Evanston, Illinois when he was six so that Marlon Sr., a traveling salesman, could be closer to company headquarters.\n\nBut it had been in the wheat fields and open landscape of Omaha that Bud grew close to his mother, Dodie Pennebaker Brando, who had the soul of an artist.\n\nShe sculpted, wrote poetry, acted and was \u2018just someone who saw the beauty in life\u2019.\n\nShe taught him to love nature, the frogs and tadpoles in the creek, the sunsets, \u2018the magic of the universe\u2019.\n\nDodie\u2019s disintegration was the sole reason Bud Brando would later turn to women for solace.\n\nBut with his father\u2019s miserliness, boozing and anger, that rage came to define their lives and they lived in fear.\n\nBud called his father a \u2018whore f**ker\u2019 because he paid $5 to a bellboy for a pint of whiskey and hooker while on the road.\n\nBrando Sr.\u2019s tirades screamed \u2018blame, shame and punishment that had no relationship to the crime\u2019, writes Mann.\n\nDodie tried to defend her son from these tirades but it was futile and affection was nonexistent from Marlon Sr.\n\nDodie took to the bottle and swallowed some pills in a suicide attempt but she recovered and soon left the tortured home.\n\nBud never forgave his father for the torment.\n\nThe intolerable home life made Bud \u2018an exploding firecracker.\n\nBud, as Marlon was called, was born in Omaha in spring of 1924, but the family \u2013 along with his three older sisters --moved to Evanston, Illinois when he was six so that Marlon Sr., a traveling salesman, could be closer to company headquarters\n\nBrando with his father, Marlon Brando, Sr. and mother Dorothy. Brando never really escaped that trauma created by his father who beat him and his mother\n\n\u2018He carried a knife and slashed tires. He shot his BB gun through the screens of his house hitting a man in the neck\u2019, writes Mann.\n\nDodie came back to the fold but she hadn\u2019t quit her drinking.\n\nMarlon Sr. brought her home one night drunk, carried her upstairs and began beating her.\n\nBud heard the punches, raced upstairs and promised to kill his father if he hit her again.\n\nSo he was sent off to Shattuck Military Academy in Minnesota \u2013 \u2018to straighten out\u2019.\n\nThere he was introduced to drama classes and encouragement from the head of the English Department, Duke Wagner, who championed cadet Bud Brando.\n\nSomething mysterious happened in their relationship that has never been revealed and they never spoke again.\n\nDuke would later be expelled for having relationships with cadets.\n\nBud had his own sexual flings with men on campus, cadets and made no judgments about anyone else\u2019s sexuality.\n\n\u2018He was a man utterly at ease with his fluid sexuality, someone who blithely disregarded the binaries of love and gender\u2019, writes Mann.\n\nBud was expelled but the best was yet to come.\n\nHe finally escaped the Midwest and headed for New York City and drama classes at the New School \u2013 at the suggestion of a sister.\n\nWith luck, he was in Stella Adler\u2019s class in her dramatic Workshop.\n\nOne of the founding members of the Group Theatre in New York, Stella created the Group and was committed to a modern, naturalistic American theatre that saw a connection to their goals and the traditions of the Yiddish theatre.\n\nShe believed \u2018Your life is one-millionth of what you know. Your talent is your imagination\u2019.\n\nBud identified with this.\n\nRecognizing Bud\u2019s talent, Stella became the nurturing and supportive mother that Dodie couldn\u2019t be and the Adlers made him an honorary Jew.\n\nHe leaned Yiddish, read the classics --- \u2018he found his tribe\u2019.\n\n\u2018I was never educated until I was exposed to Jews. I was introduced to a sense of culture\u2019, Brando is quoted.\n\nHe also developed a relationship with Stella\u2019s daughter, Ellen, who became one of his great loves.\n\nBut Ellen understood that no woman would be first in Brando\u2019s heart. There would be no proposal.\n\n\u2018There was a lot of f**king going on and I was in the thick of it\u2019, Brando remembered about that time.\n\nNow calling himself Marlon, he acted to survive but sex made him happy and that\u2019s all that mattered to him as he compulsively pursued sex.\n\n\u2018He\u2019d make his women indulge him in ways that his mother never did and then punish them for doing so by rejecting them\u2019, writes the author.\n\nIt was a pattern that almost destroyed him and damaged the women.\n\nHe chased girls, slept with gay men. He spent weekends with Ellen but during the week, led a wild life.\n\nHe began an affair with a window dresser, Celia, who became pregnant but agreed to an abortion.\n\nItalian actor Salvatore Corsitto kissing the hand of Brando in The Godfather, regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made and perhaps the actor's best performance\n\n\u2018I was killing myself and nearly killing everybody around me\u2019, Brando said.\n\nHe ran into Wally Cox, his childhood friend, in the Village who confessed that he was turned on by sadomasochism but never tried it.\n\nMarlon encouraged him to set up a trapeze in front of a mirror and have girls whip him so he could watch himself.\n\nBeing sexually happy was all that matter to Brando.\n\nYears of psychotherapy helped him focus on \u2018the dark paralyzing memories of childhood and he was diagnosed as \u2018psychoneurotic\u2019 with \u2018a chronic anxiety that stopped short of delusions or hallucinations\u2019.\n\nThe condition created panic attacks, depression and paranoia \u2013 despite the merry-go-round of sex he was on.\n\nThe post-traumatic stress of his youth left him in hell and consumed by a fear that he was being destroyed by his fame.\n\nHe just wished to be a \u2018normal person\u2019 so he fled from the press and hid from the public.\n\nHe only made movies because of a promise to his dying mother that he would. It was her dream to be an actress.\n\nWhile he had women he truly loved, he considered marriage to be \u2018bourgeois\u2019.\n\n\u2018It was only in the arms of strong, passionate women that Marlon ever found refuge from his childhood trauma\u2019, writes Mann.\n\nIn his later years, he realized he had to forgive his father if he was going to get on with his life.\n\nBut he believed there was a curse on him, the baby of the family.\n\nThe \u2018sins of the father\u2019 had come back to haunt him and his many children who didn\u2019t live with him.\n\nHe just had to learn how to love them.", "description": "Marlon Brando was not a guilt-ridden homosexual but utterly at ease with sleeping with men or women, writes author William J.
