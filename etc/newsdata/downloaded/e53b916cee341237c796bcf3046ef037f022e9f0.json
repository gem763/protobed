We think about creating amazing, compelling commerce experiences on the storefront or on your website or in your app. But I think a lot of brands don\u2019t necessarily think about the delivery experience as part of that customer experience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem is that order management involves so many different systems along with internal and external stakeholders. Trying to pull them together into a coherent system is harder than it looks, especially when it could also involve older legacy technology. As Ball pointed out, the process includes shipping carriers, warehouse management systems, ERP systems and payment and tax and fraud tools.\n\nThe Salesforce solution involves a few key pieces. For starters there is order lifecycle management, what Ball calls the brains of the operation. \u201cThis is the core logic of an order management system. Everything that extends commerce beyond the Buy button \u2014 supply chain management, order fulfillment, payment capture, invoice creation, inventory availability and custom business logic. This is the bread and butter of an order management system,\u201d he said.\n\nCustomers start by building visual order workflows. They can move between systems in an App Picker, and the information is shared between Commerce Cloud and Service Cloud, so that as customers move from sales to service, the information moves with them and it makes it easier to process inquiries from customers about an order including returns.\n\nBall says that Salesforce recognizes that not every customer will be an all-Salesforce shop and the system is designed to work with tools from other vendors, although these external tools won\u2019t show up in the App Picker. It also knows that this process involves external vendors like shipping companies, so they will be offering specific integration apps for Lightning Order Management in the Salesforce AppExchange.\n\nThe company is announcing the product today and will be making it generally available in February.", "description": "Salesforce certainly has a lot of tools crossing the sales, service and marketing categories, but until today when it announced Lightning Order Management, it lacked an integration layer that allowed companies to work across these systems to manage orders in a seamless way. \u201cThis is a new product built from the ground up on the [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Salesforce-Tower.jpg?w=707", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
