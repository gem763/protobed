In 2014, Michigan State cleared Nassar of wrongdoing after an alumna accused him of assaulting her during a medical examination. Nassar continued to work at the university until 2016, when he was fired following public accusations of sexual abuse reported by the Indianapolis Star.\n\nUnder the agreements with the Education Department, Michigan State will now be required to revamp its process for handling reports of sexual abuse.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

So, too, were the university\u2019s response to their crimes. This must not happen again, there or anywhere else.\u201d\n\nNassar was convicted of possession of child pornography and criminal sexual conduct, accused of sexually abusing dozens of girls under the guise of medical treatment over more than 20 years. The 56-year-old is now serving what amounts to a life sentence in prison.\n\nStrampel, who oversaw Nassar as dean of Michigan State\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, was found guilty of willful neglect and criminal misconduct. He was sentenced to one year in prison in August.\n\n\u201cMichigan State University did not adequately respond to complaints against Dr. Nassar and Dean Strampel and thereby subjected students to a sexually hostile environment that denied them access to\u2014and the ability to benefit from\u2014their education,\u201d DeVos said Thursday. \u201cToo many people in power knew about the behaviors and the complaints, and yet the predators continued on the payroll and abused even more students. The university repeatedly failed to take appropriate and prompt action to protect its students.\u201d\n\nThe fine and the agreement reached with the Education Department are the latest fallout from the Nassar scandal. The university paid a $500 million settlement to hundreds of Nassar\u2019s victims, and multiple university leaders have resigned, including former President Lou Anna Simon, Interim President John Engler, and on Thursday, Provost June Youatt. In announcing Youatt\u2019s resignation, current Michigan State President Samuel Stanley Jr. said the findings make \u201cvery clear that the provost and former president failed to take appropriate action\u201d in response to reports of inappropriate behavior by Nassar.\n\n\u201cThe agreements with U.S. Department of Education further remind us that we failed survivors and our community,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWhile we have made some improvements, it\u2019s by no means sufficient or the end of the road. I know the magnitude of our responsibility and am determined MSU will act thoughtfully with our focus on survivors and the safety of our community.\u201d\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "The Education Department gave Michigan State a $4.5 million fine, citing a \"systemic failure\" to protect students from Larry Nassar's abuse", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/larry-nassar-michigan-state-fine.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
