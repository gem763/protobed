Lewis\n\nS\u00c3O PAULO--Brazilian oil company Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, said third-quarter net income rose from a year earlier after the sale of a stake in its fuel-distribution unit.\n\nPetrobras said Thursday that net income increased to 9.09 billion reais ($2.25 billion) in the quarter, from BRL6.64 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Sales fell to BRL77.05 billion from BRL89.07 billion on lower oil prices, while adjusted Ebitda rose to BRL32.58 billion from BRL29.86 billion.\n\nThe company booked a 14.6% jump in output from a year earlier, as six platforms in the company's rich pre-salt fields ramped up production, which was partially balanced by the decline in oil prices.\n\nPetrobras also sold a 30% stake in Petrobras Distribuidora SA, which operates South America's biggest chain of gasoline stations, earning a capital gain of BRL13.9 billion. The gain from that sale outweighed the BRL3.2 billion that Petrobras provisioned for various legal processes and disputes.\n\nWrite to Jeffrey T.
