They finally found Katie thanks to the help of a community of strangers in a small town in another state.\n\nKatie managed to escape from a hotel room in July during a trip to Montana with owners Carole and Verne King. Though the dog loves people, she\u2019s also skittish, and was lost in a strange place near the vast open space of Glacier National Park \u2014 so the Kings knew they faced a challenge.\n\nThey reached out on social media, posted hundreds of flyers in the small town of Kalispell, tirelessly fielded calls, and drove and walked for miles, yelling Katie\u2019s name and whistling, KCRA-TV reported.\n\n'You can\u2019t give up': Woman reunited with dog after 57-day search https://t.co/lK4nMnp6nU pic.twitter.com/KzZsobDi20 \u2014 kcranews (@kcranews) September 22, 2019\n\nCarole finally spotted her a week ago in the shade of a tree with the help of strangers who pointed Katie out. \u201cI just bear-hugged her,\u201d she told the Daily Inter Lake newspaper. \u201cPeople are stopping in their vehicles, getting out and hugging us.
