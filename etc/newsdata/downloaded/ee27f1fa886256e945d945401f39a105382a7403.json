But he is in for a pay rise, especially with United eyeing a \u00a330million swoop.\n\nReds first-team coach Carrick was back on Tyneside yesterday opening a new pitch at his \u00adboyhood side Wallsend Boys Club, alongside Alan Shearer.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nBoth legends hailed the \u00adimpact of the Longstaff brothers and spoke of the importance of giving young English kids a chance in the first team.\n\nCarrick said: \u201cSean is a fantastic \u00adtalent and doing well at the \u00admoment. He hasn\u2019t played a awful lot of games yet, but the \u00adfuture is bright for him.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like \u00adcomparing his playing style to mine. It is not fair on Sean. He is \u00adcarving his own career out. He has his own traits and strengths. I \u00adalways enjoy seeing young \u00adplayers getting a chance.\n\n\u201cShearer and me needed a chance. Every player does, and it is up to you to take it.\u201d\n\nShearer said of Sean Longstaff: \u00ad\u201cDefinitely he has traits (of Carrick). He has had a good start. Newcastle are a better team with him in it, because of his energy and legs he gives the team, and his ability to receive the ball.\n\n\u201cHis passing ability is fantastic. A proud \u00admoment for the boys and the family. Maybe Newcastle have been missing that energy and vibrancy.\u201d", "description": "Sean Longstaff has been a transfer target for Man Utd for around a year and impressed in front of coach Michael Carrick on Sunday", "authors": ["Simon Bird", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Newcastle Chronicle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533358.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
