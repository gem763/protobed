Surely, we Republicans aren\u2019t that desperate for victory.\u201d\n\nSenator Smith surely knew her \u201cDeclaration of Conscience\u201d would not carry the day. Her appeal to the better angels of her party was not made in the expectation of an immediate change; sometimes the point is just to get people to look up. In the end, four more years passed before the bulk of the Republican Party looked up and turned on Senator McCarthy \u2014 four years of public show trials and thought policing that pushed the country so hard to the right that the effects lasted decades. The problem with politicians who abuse power isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t get results. It\u2019s that the results come at a high cost to the Republic \u2014 and to the reputations of those who lack the courage or wisdom to resist.\n\nThe Republican Party is again confronting a crisis of conscience, one that has been gathering force ever since Donald Trump captured the party\u2019s nomination in 2016. Afraid of his political influence, and delighted with his largely conservative agenda, party leaders have compromised again and again, swallowing their criticisms and tacitly if not openly endorsing presidential behavior they would have excoriated in a Democrat. Compromise by compromise, Donald Trump has hammered away at what Republicans once saw as foundational virtues: decency, honesty, responsibility. He has asked them to substitute loyalty to him for their patriotism itself.\n\nMr. Trump privately pressed Ukraine to serve his political interests by investigating a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as by looking into a long-debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic National Committee emails that were stolen by the Russians. Mr. Trump publicly made a similar request of China. His chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said publicly on Thursday that the administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine if it did not help \u201cfind\u201d the D.N.C. servers .", "description": "The G.O.P. will not be able to postpone a reckoning on Donald Trump\u2019s presidency for much longer.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/opinion/19gop2/19gop2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
