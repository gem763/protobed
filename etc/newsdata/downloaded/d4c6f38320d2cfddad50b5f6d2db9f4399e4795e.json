After years of corruption and economic mismanagement brought Lebanon to the brink of financial collapse, the government came up with a novel way to repair the damage: a tax on the popular messaging service WhatsApp.\n\nThe reaction to the tax was quick and furious. Spontaneous protests erupted late on Thursday, not just in Beirut but across the country. Demonstrators blocked roads, burned tyres and clashed with security forces throughout the night and into the morning.\n\nThe government quickly reversed course and abandoned the tax, but it was too late. The protests quickly transformed into an outpouring of rage against corruption, economic crisis and Lebanon\u2019s entire political class.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Thousands flocked towards the country\u2019s parliament while the government ordered all banks and schools to close.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

There are signs that the impact of the latest demonstrations could be even more significant.\n\nSimilar protest movements have been stymied in the past by Lebanon\u2019s deeply entrenched sectarian political system, which has been in place since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war. But Hanin Matta, a 30-year-old translator joining the demonstration, said this time felt different.\n\n\u201cNone of the protesters are working against each other this time. We are all here together,\u201d she said as she applied clown make-up to her face outside of parliament.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to say that the people have the power. We\u2019re sick of the system. They are all criminals,\u201d she added.\n\nAdding to the build-up of anger over the last few days, Lebanon had just witnessed some of its worst wildfires in decades, which were exacerbated by the fact that three of its firefighting helicopters were out of service due to missing parts.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In a rare display of cross-sectarian unity, protesters have targeted their own leaders as well as the Lebanese government.\n\nThe WhatsApp tax may have been the spark, but protesters are furious at a system that has enriched the country\u2019s political class and left normal people struggling to get by.\n\nCorruption, periodical political deadlock and a years-long refugee crisis have left Lebanon\u2019s economy battered. As part of its effort to balance the books, the government announced a plan this week to introduce a 0.22 cent tax on all calls made through WhatsApp and other voice messaging services, with a monthly cap of $6.\n\nWhatsApp is wildly popular in Lebanon. A Pew Research poll from 2018 found that 84 per cent of adults in the country use the platform, including 98 per cent of adults under 30.\n\nAs one protester succinctly put it in a television interview that quickly went viral: \u201cSoon, they\u2019ll put a metre on our asses so they can tax our shit too!\u201d\n\nThe levy was part of a package of austerity measures being discussed by the government as it works to prevent economic collapse and bring down one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world.\n\nThe crisis has had a dramatic impact on the lives of Lebanese people. In recent weeks, fears of a US dollar shortage has sparked panic for businesses across the country, especially those that use dollars to buy their product. Petrol stations have closed down in protest at the rising exchange rate, and bakeries have warned they will not survive.\n\nAt the end of the civil war, all the political and military leadership just moved from the streets to government Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre\n\nLebanon\u2019s parliament passed an austerity budget in June aimed at unlocking billions of dollars in international aid promised to it on the condition of structural reforms. These efforts have driven real anger among all Lebanese citizens, who see the country\u2019s political leaders as the architects of the crisis.\n\n\u201cRather than looking at ways to address corruption and leakages within the state budget to balance the books, politicians are taking the easy way out by taxing an already exhausted population,\u201d said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut.\n\nYahya added that the crisis has its roots in Lebanon\u2019s postwar political settlement, which has entrenched corruption and mismanagement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the entire post-civil war legacy, of how Lebanon has been managed both economically and politically. At the end of the civil war, all the political and military leadership just moved from the streets to government.\n\n\u201cRather than build up a state, many of them looked at state institutions as war bounty.\u201d\n\nWhere the protests go from here remains to be seen. But large numbers continued to pour onto the streets into Friday afternoon. Yara, a student from Tripoli, said she stayed in Beirut for the protests rather than going home.\n\n\u201cThere is no work, no electricity, sometimes no bread,\u201d she said. Like many young people, she and her friends have considered leaving the country because they fear they will not be able to find jobs. Like everyone else, she blamed the politicians.\n\n\u201cIt is our country, and it has been taken away from us. They stole our future,\u201d she said.", "description": "It was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.
