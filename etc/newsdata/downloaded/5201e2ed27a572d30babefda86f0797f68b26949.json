Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange were there. So were January Jones and Bob Balaban. Lucy Boynton appeared with her boyfriend Rami Malek. And, of course, there was the show\u2019s leading man, Tony-winning actor Ben Platt \u2014 alongside a life-size mannequin that looked just like him, a strange and dazzling effigy.\n\n\u201cIt was like being at Burning Man,\u201d laughs Heidi Berg, creative director with title design studio Elastic. \u201cAn enormous 3-D-printed version of Ben Platt \u2014 it seemed like we were going to set it on fire.\u201d Berg and her creative co-director, Felix Soletic, dreamed up an enormous wooden sculpture of Platt as the centerpiece of The Politician\u2019s mesmerizing opening title sequence, which imagines the hero of the series being put together piece by piece. Meticulously assembled and slickly tailored, the finished product is manufactured and manicured to perfection \u2014 an ideal presidential dummy, built from the ground up for the job. \u201cWe thought of it from the beginning as a person being artificially made,\u201d Soletic explains. \u201cHe\u2019s almost like a product to be sold later on.\u201d\n\nBerg and Soletic are veterans in the field of modern title design. Berg has worked on I Am the Night and The Alienist, while Soletic worked on Altered Carbon, Westworld, and The Crown. (Elastic, meanwhile, is one of the most popular and influential title design studios in the world, having done everything from Game of Thrones to True Detective, more or less setting the standard for prestige-TV title sequences in the process.) Both Berg and Soletic had worked with showrunner Ryan Murphy previously on his FX ballroom drama Pose, and were eager to collaborate with him again on The Politician. \u201cRyan always has a lot of ideas when he talks about opening title sequences, because he takes them seriously and loves them,\u201d Berg says. In this case, though, he didn\u2019t have anything specific in mind. He sent Berg and Soletic away with some scripts, and asked them to read, digest, and see how they were inspired.\n\n\u201cIn the scripts, you got a sense early on that this character has sociopathic tendencies and lives life by collecting things \u2014 the right experiences, friendships, and relationships, all to make him the perfect presidential candidate,\u201d Soletic says. \u201cWe abstracted those concepts into literal objects, and we compartmentalized them.\u201d Berg and Soletic landed on the idea of building the character out of all the little things he hoards and fixates on: school pins and Dale Carnegie books, blank checks and prescription drugs. We see all this identity-forming stuff come together to make the man. \u201cBut it was also about what else we collect as humans,\u201d Berg says. \u201cWe learn things. We have trauma. We collect these things and internalize them and they come to define us as human beings.\u201d\n\nIn the title sequence, this bric-a-brac has a tactile, handcrafted quality, and it\u2019s a lot more colorful and upbeat than other sequences of its kind, which tend to skew quite severe. That, too, was an intentional effort. \u201cWe like things dark and rimless and moody,\u201d Soletic laughs. \u201cWe wanted to make this one bright, saturated, and to hint at the darkness metaphorically rather than stylistically.\u201d The vivid colors and fussy arrangements are less Westworld and more Fantastic Mr. Fox. \u201cWe talked a lot about Wes Anderson,\u201d Berg says. \u201cWe wanted that attention to detail, but also for it to be colorful and sarcastic, and to embrace that influence.\u201d Soletic calls the look of it all \u201clived-in but precious.\u201d\n\nOnce the menagerie of identifying objects has been assembled, the mannequin is shut and sealed and stood upright, at which point hands descend on the wooden body to sand and carve. Unlike the tiny objects, which are entirely digital, Berg and Soletic actually shot the woodworking with real hand models and tools. \u201cThis is why Felix and I work together so well,\u201d Berg says. \u201cHe has a deep love of CG and I\u2019m obsessed with shooting things. We wanted to find a way to merge these two languages. The carving you see is real. The sanding you see is real. And some moments, like the rubbing of the wood, is a mixture of CG and real hand-model work.\u201d For Soletic, it was a matter of realism: \u201cThe subtlety of the wood grain and the dust that builds up, the way it splits open and carves \u2014 that level of nuance you just can\u2019t replicate in CG.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had people bringing their woodworking tools in from home,\u201d Berg adds. \u201cWe learned so much from them. And actually, the tools you see in the sequence belonged to members of our team.\u201d\n\nOf course, the question of the moment is whether they really built a full-blown, life-size carving of Ben Platt. Sadly, they did not: The 3-D-printed replica whipped up for the premiere was the closest they came to seeing it realized. \u201cWe so desperately wanted to do a full carving,\u201d Berg laments. \u201cThat was the goal. There was this German sculptor we were obsessed with and wanted to get. But there would have been no money left over for the actual titles.\u201d Instead, they got creative: A production designer found a fiberglass mannequin to use for inserts, and they had a small chunk of upper torso carved to for tight close-ups in the woodworking scenes. \u201cWe did do a full-body 3-D scan of Ben Platt, though,\u201d Solectic points out. \u201cWe have the CG mannequin of him and it pictured beautifully.\u201d", "description": "The Politician\u2019s mesmerizing opening title sequence imagines the show\u2019s main character being put together piece by piece into a presidential dummy.
