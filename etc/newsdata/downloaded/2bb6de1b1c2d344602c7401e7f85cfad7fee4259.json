Especially as Spanish developer Xixo Games Studio is composed of just two people.\n\nBut because the Internet only has two settings \u2013 love or hate \u2013 they\u2019ve come under increasingly hostile fire for daring to try and emulate Cuphead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the game obviously looks and plays like Cuphead you could argue it\u2019s no different from the legion of Call Of Duty clones or Mario Kart wannabes out there.\n\n\u2018Yes, of course Cuphead was a huge inspiration for Enchanted Portals\u2019, artist Gemma told Polygon. \u2018We\u2019re both avid fans and we wanted to make something similar, but always from a place of respect and admiration for the original.\u2019\n\n\u2018We were prepared for some backlash, but the trailer definitely reached way more people than we could ever anticipate, and all the hate and negativity coming our way has definitely had a huge impact on us.\u2019\n\nThe plan for Enchanted Portals is for it to become a Kickstarter project, although the crowd-funding campaign hasn\u2019t yet begun.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly already received enough publicity for the Kickstarter to be successful, but whether that will translate into money-paying backers remains to be seen.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "The developers of Enchanted Portals have admitted they\u2019re \u2018prepared for some backlash\u2019 over the similarities between their game and Cuphead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_2-a200_1570695874.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
