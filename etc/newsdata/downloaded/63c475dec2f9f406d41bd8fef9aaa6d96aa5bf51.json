But also he played as a right winger.\n\n\u201cI used him as a striker because in Brazil he played this position. It\u2019s not the best position for him, but the first (thought) in his mind is to help us... his performance and aptitude was amazing.\u201d\n\nMartinelli\u2019s brace followed a two-goal haul in their 5-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the League Cup last month and defender Hector Bellerin said the Brazilian was reaping the rewards of following Emery\u2019s advice in training.\n\n\u201cEveryone is pleased for him,\u201d Bellerin, who made his first start on Thursday after nine months out with a knee injury, told BT Sport.\n\n\u201cHe has been a player, he keeps his head down, he works really hard, he is doing what the coach wants him to do and it shows on the pitch.\u201d\n\nJoe Willock, 20, was also on target on Thursday for a youthful Arsenal lineup with an average age of 22.\n\n\u201cHistorically Arsenal have that responsibility with young players, and... my responsibility now is also speaking with the club and giving them chances,\u201d Emery added.\n\n\u201cWe want to give them chances, but we need to find our very high demands in our performance to achieve our targets. We\u2019re in one process and we want to do it as quickly as we can because our targets for the season are very important to achieve.\u201d", "description": "Arsenal manager Unai Emery hailed forward Gabriel Martinelli's hunger and aptitude after the Brazilian teenager fired in two goals and set up another in Thursday's 4-0 Europa League win over Standard Liege.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436908425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930BM", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
