There have been two evictions from the house but the latest eviction of Koena Mitra has been a bit shocking.\n\nIndiatimes got in touch with former actress and now BB contestant Koena to know about her point of view on her eviction, Salman Khan and Shehnaaz Gill and about the other contestants of the house.\n\nTwitter\n\nFirstly, we asked Koena about her short stint inside the show, \"I was never the first one to irritate or provoke people in the house. I don\u2019t have such qualities in me, I always gave reactions, and when you are mocked behind your back on your appearance, acting skills, your attitude by somebody who has zero body of work, and creditability who is not known by people. When I walked in, I was told it\u2019s a celebrity show where I recognised only three people and it will obviously disappoint you, I tried to handle it my way.\n\nDon't Miss 216 SHARES 405 SHARES 575 SHARES 9.5 K SHARES\n\nTwitter\n\nI don\u2019t know about my first or second week, I just reacted to the situations that arrived and I don\u2019t think I have never crossed the line. I have reacted but I have never really tried to provoke or attract someone just for the sake of it .\u201d\n\nWe informed her about how there is an ongoing debate that Salman was unfair with her by taking Shehanaaz's side and she said, \u201cIn the first Weekend Ka Vaar I felt he(Salman Khan) was cold with me and when Siddharth Dey started talking rubbish and then lied about it, thank god that video was aired. I tried to keep my point, where Salman didn\u2019t give me chance to keep my point. Salman didn\u2019t give me a chance to talk. First weekend, I was obviously offended by him, I felt it was one-sided, he should have given me the chance to talk.\"\n\nTwitter\n\n\"And in the second weekend, when I started talking about Shehanaaz mocking me, Salman immediately defended her saying people are loving it and when I came outside the house I saw the reality that no one is loving it. Everyone is criticising, everybody is questioning her credibility, what work has she done. No one knew about her before she entered the house, when I left the house I realised audiences reaction is exactly opposite of what Salman had said which means he was personally defending her and this didn\u2019t go down well with audiences. \"\n\nTwitter\n\n\"And when I questioned him that audiences won\u2019t like dignity, grace, strong values and principles, he said ye sabke liye alag platform hai, which means he officially said this show does not require dignity, then why are we showing it on national television. We are on national television to set an example for people. We try to inspire and motivate them so that they follow your path, that was my goal, that my personality should be appreciated and accepted and I am proud that I have done that\", she lashed out.\n\n\"In the entire conversation, Salman was not letting me talk and whenever I was talking and making sense, he was turning it upside down and he gave an idea to the Indian audience that this show doesn\u2019t require dignified, educated, wise women. He said it, 'Ye platform ye sabke liye nahi hai', toh ye platform kyun hai Hindustan mai? Kis cheez ke liye hai, aap kya promote karna chahte hai? When I was sitting there in the Weekend Ka Vaar, I felt Salman was against me and he was playing the guardian for Sana. I was extremely disappointed by Salman\u2019s attitude towards me\", she added\n\nShe even said, \u201cI know the show had a concept, but my job was not to nurture the concept of connection, my job for me was to bring my real personality and nothing else. \u201c\n\nTwitter\n\nWhen asked if she regrets being a part of the show and she says, \u201cI am extremely happy, you know why? I had gone out in a supermarket to buy something and I was overwhelmed with the public reaction when they saw me, I didn\u2019t see the time I had left half an hour before the show was on air, I saw the love for me in their eyes, they loved me the way I am, and now everyone is fighting for me as they are not happy with my eviction, and the reaction by Salman towards me, so my question is who has evicted me? If janta is showing me so much of love and support outside the house, then who evicted me?\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nWhen asked about Shehnaaz's performance in the show, she said, \u201cEverything about Shehnaaz is fake and annoying but according to Salman Khan this is what India wants to watch and I refuse to believe it.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nLastly, we asked her who can be a possible winner and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that, because many more people will walk in and I don\u2019t know who they are, right now most favourite is Paras, because he is honest, as he plays games and he says it on face. He is a true entertainer. He is very honest and transparent and has no mask. Sidharth is an intelligent man and he is the only fair person in the house. He needs anger management, minus his anger and temper problem I feel he is strong headed and fair player, he has no desperation.\u201d\n\nStay updated with us for all the Bigg Boss 13 updates.", "description": "It\u2019s just two weeks of Bigg Boss 13 and the audiences are already gripped and hooked with the concept and the drama of the show.
