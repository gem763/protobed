AFP/Getty\n\nChemsex is characterised by the use of drugs such as crystal meth, mephedrone and GHB, or gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, to enhance sexual arousal, performance and pleasure.\n\nA subset of chemsex is known as \u201cslamsex\u201d, where partygoers self-inject drugs rather than taking them as pills or via pipes.\n\nThe drugs \u201creduce inhibitions and increase feelings of horniness or lust\u201d, Mr Jaspal said, and contribute to \u201ca perfect storm\u201d in groups with high HIV rates for the virus to spread.\n\nIn a small study published in 2014 of people attending HIV clinics in England and Wales, 30 per cent of HIV-positive men surveyed reported chemsex in the previous year, and 10 per cent said they had engaged in slamsex.\n\nIgnacio Labayen de Inza, a chemsex specialist who works at several UK clinics and online as a counsellor for men seeking help, says \u201cthings have got much worse\u201d since then.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Rates of infections and high-risk sexual behaviour were higher among the 30 per cent who reported having engaged in chemsex or slamsex.\n\nGlobally, the fight against HIV and AIDS has made dramatic progress in the past decade. According to the UNAIDS agency, 1.7 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2018, a 16 per cent drop since 2010, driven mostly by reducing HIV rates in Africa.\n\nBut progress is stalling and the epidemic is tightening its grip in key groups. UNAIDS says more then half of new HIV cases in 2018 were in minority or marginalised groups such as men who have sex with men, transgender people and sex workers.\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS can\u2019t be cured, but can be kept in check for decades with cocktails of highly effective antiviral medicines. It\u2019s partly this advance that is behind the high-risk practice of chemsex, said Mr de Inza.\n\n\u201cPeople are not scared any more of HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people I see say they think \u2018it\u2019s only a matter of time anyway, so I might as well have some fun\u2019.\u201d\n\nShannon Hader, deputy director of UNAIDS, says the key to limiting chemsex and its consequences is to get the right protection messages and methods to those who need them.\n\nEncouraging use of HIV prevention drugs known as PreP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is one effective step, she said, and can give people who have chemsex some control over their health.\n\n\u201cIn this epidemic, we always have to be looking for what\u2019s coming next that we\u2019re not addressing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd with PreP, we need to ensure we\u2019re not missing people in the chemsex environment.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "A surge in \u201cchemsex\u201d parties, where some people spend days getting high on drugs and having sex with scores of partners, is refuelling epidemics of HIV among gay men in European towns and cities, doctors say.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/11/chemsex.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
