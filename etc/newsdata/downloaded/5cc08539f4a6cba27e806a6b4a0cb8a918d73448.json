(Twitter / @BradyTrett)\n\nWhen one of the toughest \u2014 if not the toughest \u2014 player in the league stares you down before throwing fists, it\u2019s understandable for the fight to end up being slightly one-sided.\n\nIn Thursday night\u2019s game between the Senators and Vegas Golden Knights, newcomer Scott Sabourin, representing the visiting Ottawa team, appeared to challenge the legendary Ryan Reaves to a fight before a neutral zone face-off.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLet\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t go well for the rookie.\n\nRyan Reaves drops the gloves with Scott Sabourin pic.twitter.com/s4qhY4ob9a \u2014 Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) October 18, 2019\n\nThis was the 66th fight in the NHL for Reaves, while this is the very first for Sabourin. What a way to introduce your ability to drop the gloves. The Knights skater stared the inexperienced Senator down and barely moved while his opponent scattered about, trying to find an angle to attempt the first blow. That was until Sabourin got a little too close, and Reaves was able to bring him right where he wanted him and landed two fists on the side of his helmet.\n\nTo be fair, the rookie was able to get in a couple of punches before being thrown down to the ground and pummelled until the linesman intervened. Reaves then did what he\u2019s loved for \u2014 showing some personality and getting the fans excited with a small \u2018that\u2019s it?\u2019 gesture.\n\nThrough his 585 games, the Golden Knights skater has a total of 863 penalty minutes. Comparing that to six total games and 11 PIMs, it was essentially the NHL\u2019s version of David and Goliath.\n\nMore NHL coverage from Yahoo Sports Canada", "description": "The two players battled it out, but Goliath won this round.", "authors": ["Thomas Williams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LW7lqUPQ3056l8_tWv6zpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DL3QaG31EKbyWjLcnkjB5w--~B/aD03NDY7dz0xMzI1O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/2e0ff200-f152-11e9-bbef-082b603d7e0d", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
