MGM is also selling its Circus Circus casino in the city to real estate mogul Phil Ruffin.\n\nChief Executive Officer Jim Murren said on a conference call Wednesday that he\u2019ll use the proceeds from the MGM Grand sale to reduce debt and invest in new growth opportunities, including a potential $10 billion casino in Japan and sports betting in the U.S.\n\nThe company\u2019s transition should result in higher free cash flow per share and a more flexible financial structure that allows MGM to better capitalize on its strengths as a casino developer and manager, Murren said.\n\nMGM Resorts is continuing to evaluate the sale of its remaining real estate assets -- including CityCenter, a joint venture with Dubai World that owns the Aria resort in Las Vegas. The company also plans to reduce its majority stake in MGM Growth Properties, a real estate investment trust, Murren said.\n\nA half-dozen large real estate investors considered buying the Bellagio before Blackstone won out, according to Murren. He said the company is committed to reducing its stake in MGM Growth Properties to under 50% or less. The REIT could be a buyer of the MGM Grand.\n\n\u201cIf it came down to a transaction between a third party and MGP, we\u2019re always going to favor MGP in a close race,\u201d Murren said.\n\nThe company has been under pressure from activist investors to boost its stock price over the past few years. Murren has taken steps to do so, including two rounds of companywide cost cutting.\n\nIn 2016, the company put the bulk of its properties into MGM Growth. That entity also has an option to purchase a Massachusetts casino, the MGM Springfield, which will become the company\u2019s last wholly owned casino in the U.S. once the MGM Grand sale is completed.\n\nSeparately, MGM reported third-quarter sales that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates as result of fewer Asian visitors playing baccarat in Las Vegas. Profit beat expectations on the acquisition of new regional casinos and the addition of new high-roller suites in Macau.\n\nThe shares were up 1.3% to $29 in extended trading. The stock initially fell, but recovered after the MGM Grand sale plan was announced.\n\nMurren reiterated his target of as much as $3.9 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization next year.\n\n(Updates sale plans starting in sixth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles at cpalmeri1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Rob Golum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- MGM Resorts International expects to announce a buyer for its flagship MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas by the end of year, marking one of the final steps toward its goal of becoming an \u201casset-light\u201d casino operator.The company agreed this month to sell the Bellagio resort in Las Vegas to", "authors": ["Christopher Palmeri"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
