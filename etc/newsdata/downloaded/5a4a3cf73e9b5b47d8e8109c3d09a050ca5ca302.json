Today it revealed some details about the hardware we\u2019ll be seeing when the console launches holiday 2020 \u2014 but not, frustratingly, what kinds of games we can expect to see.\n\nI suspect the specific titles will have to wait until next year\u2019s E3 or perhaps a State of Play reveal of the actual console. But I think I might have a hunch what one of those launch titles will be.\n\nI noticed, while reading the official blog post from Sony Interactive Entertainment President Jim Ryan, that he uses examples of particular games when speaking about the kinds of feedback offered by the new controller. He says of the haptic reponses that \u201ccrashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field.\u201d Sony has released at least one Gran Turismo game on every PlayStation console, and the Madden series always makes a perennial appearance, so those examples don\u2019t seem that unusual.\n\nBut when describing the new controller\u2019s \u201cadaptive triggers,\u201d Ryan said they would be able to simulate \u201cthe tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow.\u201d That\u2019s very specific language, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t see why he would choose such terms if that weren\u2019t one of the use cases they\u2019d already developed.\n\nNow who do we know, in Sony\u2018s army of exclusive characters, who uses a bow and arrow?\n\nOh right. Aloy, protagonist of one of the PS4\u2019s most successful first-party titles, uses a bow and arrow as her primary weapon. And, in case you think I\u2019m talking out of school, one of the voice actresses from the first game let the sequel\u2019s development slip earlier this year. It\u2019s not a sealed deal, but to me at least it\u2019s looking pretty likely that Horizon Zero Dawn 2 is in the works for the PS5.\n\nIt\u2019d be a smart move to make this a launch title. The PS4\u2019s launch lineup was a little lackluster, in my opinion. Of the console-exclusive titles on offer, only Resogun and Killzone: Shadowfall seem to have held up to any test of time. When\u2019s the last time you got a hankering to play Knack or Flower?\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn was more than just a great game \u2014 it sold well. 10 million copies within two years is nothing to sneeze at. Given the Uncharted series, Sony\u2019s dynasty on PS3 and PS4, pretty definitively wrapped up with the last two installments, the company will undoubtedly be looking for more games to spin into lucrative franchises. God of War and Spider-Man are options, but both were released in 2018, while HZD was released in February 2017. While I have no doubt sequels to all three are in the works, a theoretical HZD2 will have had the longest time to cook.\n\nAnd Sony has to announce something popular to draw in the buyers. Microsoft\u2019s already played the biggest card in its hand by announcing Halo: Infinite for Project Scarlett. While that game won\u2019t be next-gen exclusive \u2014 it\u2019s also coming to Xbox One and PC \u2014 it\u2019s at least a game and a face (or helmet in Master Chief\u2019s case) Microsoft can associate with its console.\n\nOf the rest of the games, I\u2019d stake my back teeth we\u2019ll see The Last of Us Part II Remastered within a year of launch. It\u2019d be foolish to release such an important tentpole game less than a year from the end of the console\u2019s lifecycle and not have some plan to extend its viability into the next generation. They did it with the first Last of Us, which came out on PS3 five months before the PS4 was released and which was remastered for the PS4 seven months later.\n\nWe\u2019ll also probably see a few new IPs. I was hoping Ghost of Tsushima would be a PS5 title, given how cool the sweet samurai moves would feel with a haptic controller, but Ryan confirmed in the announcement that it\u2019ll be released for the PS4. Everything else is up in the air.\n\nBut what do you think? Would Horizon Zero Dawn 2 entice you to buy a PS5?
