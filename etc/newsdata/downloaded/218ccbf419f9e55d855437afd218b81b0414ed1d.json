It was one of the toughest sporting sanctions by a sports body against the country for corruption and systematic doping.\n\nAsked about his hopes for his second term, Coe replied: \u201cNot to be dominated by Russia.\u201d\n\nThat is unlikely since Russia\u2019s ban was extended by the congress on Wednesday. It means for the second straight world championships the only Russians competing - 30 - will do so without their country\u2019s flag or uniform. That is 11 more Russian neutral athletes competing than the 2017 world championships in London.\n\nIAAF election day started with the Athletics Integrity Unit suspending one of the vice presidential candidates - Ahmed Al Kamali of the United Arab Emirates - for potential violations of the code of conduct.\n\nThe IAAF elected its first female vice president, with the vote won by Ximena Restrepo, the sprinter who collected Colombia\u2019s first Olympic medal in athletics at the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nThe other vice presidents are Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, Geoffrey Gardner of Norfolk Island and Prince Nawaf Bin Mohammed Al Saud of Saudi Arabia.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sebastian Coe marked his re-election as IAAF president on Wednesday by announcing Chinese conglomerate Wanda as the Diamond League title sponsor in what he called the biggest commercial deal for track and field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Harris"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
