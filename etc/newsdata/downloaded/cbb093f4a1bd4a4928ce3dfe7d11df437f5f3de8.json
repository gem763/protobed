The intention is not to kill coal producers, but to ensure that although they must make their money, they must not make obscene profits because of the pressure [to meet demand]. So, we are talking to both the producers of renewables and of coal,\u201d he said.\n\nMantashe said the approval of the IRP by Cabinet earlier this week had brought much-needed certainty to the economy and had, hopefully, put to rest the debate about the country\u2019s future energy mix.\n\n\u201cAs a department, we have been categorically clear from the outset that our task is not to be a lobby group for a particular energy technology, but rather, to execute our mandate of ensuring the security of energy supply using all available resources,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow that the energy mix has been outlined, we must work with the necessary speed and resolve to ensure its implementation.\u201d\n\nThe IRP was submitted in draft form to the National Economic Development and Labour Council, better known as Nedlac \u2013 the consensus-seeking body comprising government, business, labour and civil society \u2013 in August last year. It is the latest blueprint that sets out how the country will meet its energy needs until 2030.\n\nMantashe added that government would discuss the administering of prices with the National Energy Regulator of SA and the SA Nuclear Energy Corporation.\n\n\n\nHe said Eskom had been given the go-ahead to incorporate renewable energy, so now there was nothing stopping the state-owned power utility from competing and acquiring generation assets in that sector.\n\n\u201cEskom must have the freedom to expand its interests to renewable energy,\u201d he said.\n\nMantashe emphasised the current price charged by independent power producers (IPPs) was unsustainable, and government could not commit to not capping it.\n\n\u201cThe price of electricity is expensive. We are told that IPPs charge about R2.40 a unit, but the reality is that for window one photovoltaic [which is solar power], we are paying R4.25 a unit \u2013 because it was sold at R2.20 but was guaranteed an increase at CPI, and this has moved it to R4.25 a unit.\n\n\u201cThis is unsustainable for the economy, and all the energy-intensive sectors are battling,\u201d he said, adding that government would negotiate with the various sectors to find a solution, but would not impose anything.\n\nNUCLEAR\n\nMantashe said South Africa was not planning to install large nuclear units but rather, smaller, modular nuclear plants.\n\nSuch an intervention meant the following would have to be done:\n\n. According to Mantashe, the department was discussing with Eskom, which owns Koeberg power station, the possibility of extending its life by 20 years \u2013 from its projected end of life in 2024, until 2044.\n\n\u201cWhen we extend the life of Koeberg, we are not acquiring new capacity but merely extending the current capacity by 20 years,\u201d he said.\n\n. Immediately starting a nuclear build programme to add 2 500 megawatts of power \u201cbecause it is a no-regret option in the long term\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that government was not outsourcing electricity generation but merely diversifying sources of electricity generation.\n\nAny businesses that saw an opportunity would be welcome to contribute, he said.\n\nAccording to the IRP, the energy mix will continue to be heavily reliant on coal because it is the resource that the country has in abundance.\n\nHowever, greater investment will be directed at technologies that will make coal usage more efficient, with low emissions.\n\nMantashe said the department would also issue an urgent invitation for solutions to the country\u2019s deepening energy woes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe IRP recognises that because of challenges with Eskom\u2019s plant performance, there is an immediate supply-and-demand gap that needs to be addressed. The current load shedding attests to this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need to secure additional capacity to increase our reserve margins. The department will shortly issue a request for information regarding supply-and-demand options available that can be brought online in the shortest possible time, at a reasonable cost.\n\n\u201cAn increased focus on monitoring the supply-and-demand balance by the department and the regulator will ensure that we are proactive in dealing with the challenges posed by ageing plants and technological advancements,\u201d Mantashe said.\n\nThe IRP, which is supposed to secure the country\u2019s generation capacity for demand in both a low- and medium-growth economic environment, also aims to restore an improved reserve margin.\n\nThe plan proposes that the following capacity be added to the energy mix for the period up to 2030: 1 500MW of generation from coal, 2 500MW from hydropower, 6 000MW from photovoltaic, 14 400MW from wind, 2 088MW from storage and 3 000MW from gas.\n\nCoal, the plan indicates, will continue to play a significant but declining role in the future, accounting for 59% of output by 2020.\n\nNuclear will contribute 5%, hydro 8%, solar 6%, wind 18%, and gas and energy storage technologies 2% each.", "description": "Government has called on private energy producers to offer better prices and says it will soon issue an urgent call for energy solutions to mitigate Eskom\u2019s deepening supply crisis.", "authors": ["Lesetja Malope"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/73b2c5ed4ba94180bff649c6e3413498.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
