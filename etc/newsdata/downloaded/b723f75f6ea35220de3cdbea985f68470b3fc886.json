However, its recent economic achievement is largely on the back of higher export levels \u2014 something that could become a problem given the ongoing trade disputes worldwide.\n\nPortugal \"is more exposed (to global trade) than before the crisis,\" Ana Andrade, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC over the phone Wednesday.\n\n\"The share of exports has grown. Portugal is (now) more integrated in the global trade system,\" she said.\n\nIn 2010, one year prior to requesting financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU, Portugal exported about 37.3 billion euros ($40.88 billion). Since then, exports have increased almost every year, reaching about 58 billion euros in 2018, according to preliminary data. Portuguese exports accounted for more than 40% of the country's growth rate in 2018 compared to almost 30% in 2010.\n\n\"Whilst the Portuguese economy is projected to grow faster than that of the euro zone as a whole, a sharper than expected global and European downturn would expose the persistent underlying macroeconomic imbalances,\" Michiel van der Veen, an economist at RaboResearch, said in an email.\n\nHis forecasts point to a growth rate of 1.7% in 2019 and 1.2% in 2020. Portugal grew 2.8% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018.", "description": "Economists are questioning how long Portugal's economic recovery will last with a new political cycle about to begin.", "authors": ["Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106163889-1570167301554gettyimages-1178194446.jpeg?v=1570167360", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
