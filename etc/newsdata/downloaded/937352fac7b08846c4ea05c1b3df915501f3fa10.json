She likes the key lime pie.'\n\nPresident Trump (left) told a rally in Louisiana on Friday that Oprah Winfrey (right) 'used to be a big friend of mine'\n\nTrump and Winfrey are photographed together at a heavyweight boxing match in Atlantic City in 1988\n\nTrump posted an image on Instagram in 2011 showing him and his entire family during their appearance on Oprah Winfrey's talk show\n\nTrump said that he was the only major supporter of Kemp who helped defeat Abrams, the first black woman to be a major party's nominee for governor.\n\nThe president mentioned that Abrams was endorsed by Winfrey, Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nKemp defeated Abrams by some 50,000 votes in a hotly contested election. It was a controversial race since Kemp was also secretary of state, meaning he oversaw the very same election in which he was running.\n\nWinfrey supported Abrams (the two women are seen together in Marietta, Georgia, in November 2018). Abrams made history as the first black woman to run as the nominee of a major party in a state gubernatorial race\n\nTrump bragged about helping Brian Kemp (seen left with Trump in Macon, Georgia in November 2018) defeat Democrat Stacey Abrams in the Georgia gubernatorial race last year\n\nAbrams claimed that Kemp purged some 670,000 voter registrations.\n\nTrump has a long history with Winfrey dating back to his appearances on her daytime talk show.\n\nIn 1998, Trump appeared on her show and publicly wondered whether he should run for president.\n\nIn 1999, Trump appeared on CNN's Larry King Live and said he'd want Winfrey as his running mate if he ran for president.\n\n'I love Oprah,' Trump said.\n\n'She likes the key lime pie,' Trump said of Winfrey, who was a guest at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort (seen above)\n\nOprah's official web site includes a recipe for a 'Mar-a-Lago key lime pie'\n\nBefore running as Republican, Trump praised Winfrey, saying she 'knows how to win'\n\nTrump even posted an inspirational quote from Winfrey in May 2014\n\n'Oprah would always be my first choice. \u2026 I'll tell ya, she's really a great woman, though.\n\n'She is a terrific woman. She's somebody that's very special.'\n\nTrump has also posted numerous tweets in praise of Winfrey.\n\nWhen Winfrey launched her own television network, Trump tweeted in April 2012: 'Oprah will end up doing just fine with her network - she knows how to win.'\n\nTrump also posted an image showing his family appearing on Winfrey's show in 2011.\n\nWinfrey and Trump were even photographed together ringside at a heavyweight boxing match in Atlantic City in 1988.\n\nIt was also reported that Winfrey convinced Trump to allow her to use Mar-a-Lago to host a birthday party for Maya Angelou, who turned 80 in 2008.\n\nOn Oprah's web site, she has a recipe for key lime pie from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nLast year, Trump blasted Winfrey after she interviewed a focus group of voters during a 60 Minutes segment\n\nBut the two have not been close since Winfrey publicly expressed her support for Barack Obama while Trump has made a career of criticizing the 44th president.\n\nSince Trump became president, he has criticized Winfrey, who was rumored to be considering a run for the White House before saying she had no interest.\n\nThe president called Winfrey 'very insecure' after she interviewed a focus group of voters during a segment for 60 Minutes in February 2018.\n\n'The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!' Trump tweeted last year.\n\nWinfrey has never criticized Trump by name. She has made do with lamenting the 'noise' and 'vitriol' in current political discourse.", "description": "President Trump called out Oprah Winfrey at his rally in Louisiana on Friday, saying the daytime talk queen was once his friend who liked the dessert served at his Mar-a-Lago estate.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/04/19616298-0-image-a-56_1570850840724.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
