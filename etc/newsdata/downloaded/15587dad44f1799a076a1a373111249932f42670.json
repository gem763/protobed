You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe Letter from the People to the Powerful, backed by The Independent, states that the deal reached last week between Mr Johnson and EU27 leaders \u201ccannot meet the promises made [in the 2016 referendum campaign], nor be said to represent the will of the people\u201d.\n\nMr Johnson will on Monday make a second attempt to win MPs\u2019 approval for his deal in a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d, after his first bid on Saturday was thwarted by a 322-306 vote in favour of withholding the green light until all ratification legislation was complete.\n\nBut the speaker, John Bercow, is expected to reject the motion, after saying that it would be \u201cquite curious and irregular\u201d to allow a vote intended purely to invalidate Saturday\u2019s result.\n\nAnd sources close to the group of former Tories expelled from the party for rebelling against no deal said that if a meaningful vote was called, it would be countered with a similar amendment to the one tabled by Sir Oliver Letwin that forced Mr Johnson to write a letter to Brussels asking for an extension to the Brexit process.\n\nDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said he believed the government could get its deal through parliament. \u201cWe seem to have the numbers in the House of Commons. A lot of people say \u2018Get this done and move on\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s unsigned letter \u2013 accompanied by a signed message advising against a \u201ccorrosive\u201d delay \u2013 was described as a potential contempt of parliament by Labour\u2019s John McDonnell and will be the subject of legal action in Scotland\u2019s highest court on Monday.\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry, who led the successful legal challenge to the PM\u2019s unlawful suspension of parliament, branded his letters \u201cpathetic\u201d and confirmed she will pursue action in Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The party is expected to focus on amendments to boost ties with the EU\u2019s customs union and to prevent a no-deal cliff-edge at the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020.\n\nThe Final Say movement is increasingly hopeful of winning a Commons vote, with one source saying that a division on a referendum between Remain and Mr Johnson\u2019s plan was now \u201con a knife-edge\u201d, and one pitching Remain against no deal was comfortably winnable, in the event that the PM\u2019s deal fails.\n\n\u201cOf course we need an amendment to say that whatever deal gets through, it should be subject to a referendum where that deal is put to the public and they\u2019re asked, \u2018do you want to leave on these terms, or would you rather remain in the EU\u2019,\u201d said Sir Keir.\n\nAsked about the crucial Labour whip, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve already voted, I think, three times as a party for a second referendum with a three-line whip behind it. That\u2019s the clear policy.\u201d\n\nIt \u201cmakes sense\u201d that Labour would repeat the offer made to Theresa May when it said \u201cwe don\u2019t think your deal is very good, but if it\u2019s up against the safeguard of being able to remain, then we will allow it to proceed in that way\u201d, he said.\n\nFormer foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a backer of a people\u2019s vote, said Sir Keir\u2019s words were \u201csignificant\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is clear now that the party as a whole and the shadow cabinet are firmly behind a referendum in a way that people weren\u2019t sure of before,\u201d she told The Independent. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that quite a number of people who were very much opposed have come round to the idea.\u201d\n\nLabour\u2019s Peter Kyle said he would table an amendment for a confirmatory referendum \u201cas soon as politically appropriate\u201d, though timing was uncertain because of the unpredictability of the government\u2019s plans.\n\nAn \u201cindicative vote\u201d on a second referendum moved by Mr Kyle and fellow Labour MP Phil Wilson failed by just 12 votes earlier this year. But an amendment may struggle to improve on this result, as 45 Tories \u2013 including a number of government ministers \u2013 abstained in that division but could be expected to oppose it this time around.\n\nKey to success would be winning over pro-deal Labour MPs and exiled Tories sitting as independents. Most of these are likely to be swayed only if Tuesday\u2019s vote is close enough to suggest that Mr Johnson\u2019s package needs a referendum attached to be sure of passing.\n\nAnd there are also tentative feelers being put out to the Democratic Unionist Party after its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds suggested it was looking at options to amend the PM\u2019s deal, which they regard as unacceptable.\n\nThe party\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, Sammy Wilson, said the DUP was not seeking a second referendum.\n\nBut Sir Keir said: \u201cI would openly invite the DUP to talk to us, because anybody who wants to improve on the situation \u2013 and they do \u2013 should be working together.\u201d\n\nA pro-referendum source said the DUP might be swayed by the thought that they are faced with a choice between a general election which they do not relish \u2013 if Mr Johnson seeks to capitalise on his deal going through \u2013 or a referendum.\n\nSir Keir acknowledged that staging a fresh public vote would take as long as 22 weeks. But he said the PM was trying to hurry the process through in order to avoid having the flaws in his plan uncovered.\n\n\u201cThe more scrutiny there is of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, the more I think people are going to be persuaded that it\u2019s a very bad deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of the reasons I think he\u2019s trying to bounce us through this is because if you look at the detail it exposes his half-truths and untruths.\u201d\n\nBut a Downing Street source said: \u201cWe cannot allow parliament\u2019s letter to lead to parliament\u2019s delay \u2013 we must leave on 31 October and finally get Brexit done. The best way of doing this is for MPs to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal.\u201d\n\nIt is expected that the debate on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill will involve long hours in the Commons and potential weekend sittings in the Lords.\n\nA government source said: \u201cThe public will expect us to move at pace to get the withdrawal agreement passed so we can leave on 31 October. There will be time for parliament to consider the legislation and any amendments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine urged voters to sign the Letter from the People to the Powerful to put maximum pressure on politicians to give the public a say.\n\n\u201cOne million supporters of the people\u2019s vote marched outside parliament, while inside MPs from all parties stood firm against Boris Johnson\u2019s efforts to force his hard and bitter Brexit on our country,\u201d said Lord Heseltine.\n\n\u201cFrom the Highlands, to Belfast, from Cardiff to Penzance, people came from across every corner of the land to make themselves heard.\n\n\u201cWe will march on. We\u2019re sending a letter from the people to the powerful to demand they don\u2019t turn their backs and instead give the people the final say. Sign the letter. Send the message. Let\u2019s secure a people\u2019s vote.\u201d\n\nThe Final Say letter can be signed at http://www.peoples-vote.uk/letter", "description": "Labour is ready to whip its MPs to back a second Brexit referendum in crucial votes over the coming days, in what backers said was a \u201csignificant\u201d step forward in the push for a public vote.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/20/13/Final-Say-march-52.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
