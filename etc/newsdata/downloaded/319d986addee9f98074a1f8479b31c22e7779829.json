You just have to hope they will sulkily acquiesce\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Boris Johnson has been holding meetings with parliamentary factions he hopes will back any deal he reaches\n\nAs well as the DUP, Mr Johnson is also trying to secure support from Tory Brexiteers, most of whom are part of the European Research Group.\n\nERG chairman Steve Baker told reporters after a meeting in Downing Street on Wednesday evening his group \"hope [to] be with the prime minister, but there are thousands of people out there who are counting on us not to let them down and we are not going to\".\n\n\"We are just really wishing the prime minister well and hoping he has total success. We know there will be compromises, but we will be looking at this deal in minute detail with a view to supporting it, but until we see that text, we can't say.\"\n\nThe Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that if a deal cannot be completed at the two-day summit, European leaders could gather again before the end of the month to continue Brexit talks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson likened the Brexit talks to climbing Everest, saying the summit was \"not far\" but still surrounded by \"cloud\", according to MPs he addressed at the 1922 committee of backbenchers.\n\nAs Wednesday draws to a close, a deal is still DBP - difficult but possible, in case you haven't caught the lingo by now.\n\nI hear from both sides of the Channel that the issues between the UK, Ireland and the EU are pretty much ironed out.\n\nA schedule is in place for EU leaders to be able to sign off a deal tomorrow, discussing it as the first item on the agenda at the summit if the ink is dry.\n\nThe government has in place its plan to ask MPs to approve the hypothetical deal in Parliament on Saturday.\n\nDespite all the obstacles, all the warnings about the tightness of the timetable, it is not yet too late.\n\nRead more from Laura here\n\nMr Johnson faces another deadline on Saturday - the date set out in the so-called Benn Act, which was passed last month by MPs seeking to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf MPs have not approved a deal - or voted for leaving the EU without one - by Saturday, then Mr Johnson must send a letter to the EU requesting an extension to 31 January 2020 - something he has repeatedly refused to do.\n\nOn Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay confirmed Mr Johnson would write such a letter if no deal was in place by Saturday.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman confirmed the government will table a motion for Parliament to sit this Saturday from 09:00 to 14:00 BST.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the House of Commons will definitely sit on Saturday - the government could table the motion but not push it to a vote.", "description": "Boris Johnson travels to Brussels as efforts continue back home to win support for his Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/164C8/production/_109263319_40827874-4a88-42be-9380-8156a54430fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
