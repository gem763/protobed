Police recently stopped tallying the number of participants in public rallies, but store owners downtown said the crowds looked similar to those seen during candlelight protests two years ago that led to the ouster of President Park Geun-hye.\n\nSimultaneously, students at a dozen universities including Korea and Yonsei held their first combined candlelight vigil in Hyehwa-dong in northern Seoul.\n\nBut there was no reaction from Cheong Wa Dae.\n\nLast Saturday, when Moon supporters rallied in front of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office to demand it stop investigating Cho, the presidential office expressed support for the justice minister and insisted prosecutors should \"solemnly accept how many people had gathered\" and added that the sheer number of the crowd \"demonstrates the level of aspiration for prosecution reforms.\"\n\nIt remains a mystery why Moon railroaded Cho's appointment through despite massive protests and at the risk of fatally damaging his own approval ratings.", "description": "More Massive Protests Demand Justice Minister's Ouster", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/04/2019100401122_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
