But you could argue that everyone else involved has lost.'\n\nThe infamous land was described as 'dream inspiring' and was highly sought after by billionaires across the globe.\n\nOver its lifetime it had been owned by both Middle Eastern and Hollywood royalty, including a sister of the Shah of Iran the Princess Shams Pahlavi, and American TV host Merv Griffin in 1987.\n\nThe prime property had six plots of land, a helipad and stunning views of Los Angeles.\n\nOn a clear day it was claimed that you could see from the San Gabriel mountains to Catalina Island.\n\nDespite it's overwhelming claims, no one had ever built a house on the property.\n\nIt was owned by Mark Hughes, the founder of Herbalife, who at the time purchased the grounds for a record-breaking $8.5 million.\n\nHe intended to develop it himself but in 2000 Hughes died and ownership was passed onto the Mark Hughes Trust.\n\nFour years later Dickens had allegedly convinced the former lead trustee, Conrad Klein, to allow him full control.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the trust would lend Dickens $23 million to develop the land and ownership for a certain length of time.\n\nHughes had plans to develop the property for himself however he died in 2000 before any construction work began\n\nThe Mountain was once owned by a sister of the late Shah of Iran, the Princess Shams Pahlavi, (left), who had planned to build a lavish palace there, left, the property was later acquired by talk show host-turned-TV-producer Merv Griffin, (right)\n\nThe undeveloped parcel of land, known fittingly as 'The Mountain,' was acquired by the Mark Hughes Trust, with Herbalife Founder Mark Hughes, who had owned it previously and died in 2000\n\nBy 2007, Dickens and Noval had met and decided to partner up and would go onto fight battles from the Trust who wanted to take back property.\n\nThe trust suffered several legal defeats in the court, which further reinforced Dickens' right to continue to work the land.\n\nBy 2013, a judge removed Klein from the trust due to the deal with Dickens, which he described as 'imprudent,' Hollywood Reporter wrote.\n\nAt certain points during this real estate boom in Los Angeles, the property was claimed to have increased in value by up to $500,000 a week, Hollywood Reporter wrote.\n\nSeveral high profile suitors lined-up including Jeff Bezos who reportedly visited four times, often by helicopter.\n\nIn 2018, Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia toured the property alongside Oprah Windrey, Rupert Murdoch and Tim Cook.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers and ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer also looked at the property.\n\nWhile several offers were made, nothing came close to the asking price of $1 billion.\n\nThe property attracted the attention of royalty, celebrities and businessmen alike, including Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (left) who toured the property alongside Oprah Windrey (center).

Noval and Dickens thought it was around $80 million.\n\nBelieving another legal case was underway Hughes team filed for bankruptcy, which prompted the property to be sold at auction in August.\n\nThey allowed the property to be sold for $100,000, believing the further $200,000 million was still owed by Dickens.", "description": "Victorino Noval was a part of dealings with business partner Charles 'Chip' Dickens that would see the most expensive property in America sold for a tiny sum.", "authors": ["Josh Saunders For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19607242-0-image-a-79_1570828521713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
