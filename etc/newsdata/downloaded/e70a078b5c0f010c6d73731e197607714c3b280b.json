Navy pilots reported to their superiors that the objects had no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes, but that they could reach 30,000 feet and hypersonic speeds.\n\n\u201cThese things would be out there all day,\u201d said Lt. Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for 10 years, and who reported his sightings to the Pentagon and Congress. \u201cKeeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we\u2019d expect.\u201d\n\nIn late 2014, a Super Hornet pilot had a near collision with one of the objects, and an official mishap report was filed. Some of the incidents were videotaped, including one taken by a plane\u2019s camera in early 2015 that shows an object zooming over the ocean waves as pilots question what they are watching.\n\n\u201cWow, what is that, man?\u201d one exclaims. \u201cLook at it fly!\u201d\n\nNo one in the Defense Department is saying that the objects were extraterrestrial, and experts emphasize that earthly explanations can generally be found for such incidents. Lieutenant Graves and four other Navy pilots, who said in interviews with The New York Times that they saw the objects in 2014 and 2015 in training maneuvers from Virginia to Florida off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, make no assertions of their provenance.", "description": "No one at the Pentagon is saying that the objects are extraterrestrial, but the Navy has issued new classified guidance for reporting unexplained aerial phenomena.", "authors": ["Helene Cooper", "Ralph Blumenthal", "Leslie Kean"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/28/us/politics/00dc-ufo2/00dc-ufo2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-26"}
