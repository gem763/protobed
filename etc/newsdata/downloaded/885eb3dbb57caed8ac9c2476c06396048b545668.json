Clocking in at a Category 5 storm with gusting winds between 185 and 220 miles per hour, the storm is not a force to be reckoned with. So far, the Bahamas has received the most damage from the storm, causing the deaths of at least five people (not including those potentially trapped in rubble) according to the country's prime minister. About 13,000 homes have been destroyed by the storm, and the tally continues to rise as the damage is assessed.\n\nThe storm has since weakened to a Category 2, but the path of the hurricane is now pointed toward the United States. While the United States Coast Guard is helping out Bahamians affected by the hurricane, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina are preparing to be hit by the storm in some capacity.\n\nHere are the aerial images of the overwhelming destruction on Great Abaco Island that just aired on @CNN.

Here's what you can do:\n\nDonate to World Central Kitchen disaster relief\n\nChef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and his team are helping out four locations across the Bahamas to feed those affected by Hurricane Dorian. You might not be able to send food down there yourself due to the nature of the damage, but you can make a donation online on World Central Kitchen's website.\n\nMiami-Dade Community Emergency Operations Center, All Hands and Hearts Smart Response, and the International Medical Corps are assisting the Bahamas as well, and are accepting donations.\n\nSupport the City of Miami's donation drive\n\nMiami may or may not get hit by Hurricane Dorian, so they're collecting supplies that will allow them to stay prepared. In the event that Miami is not affected, donated supplies will be sent to Coconut Grove in the Bahamas to provide Bahamians relief as part of their BahamaStrong initiative. They need:\n\nWater\n\nDiapers\n\nCanned goods\n\nCan openers\n\nBaby formula\n\nFlashlights, batteries, and small generators\n\nFirst aid kits\n\nSunscreen\n\nMosquito spray\n\nFund Team Rubicon Disaster Response\n\nTeam Rubicon Disaster Response is a nonprofit disaster relief organization that is composed of military veterans and first responders that help rebuild houses, clean up debris, and mobilize large groups of volunteers. Ahead of Hurricane Dorian, they assisted the Bahamas by boarding up windows and putting down sandbags. Now, they're helping with the clean up and rebuilding phase. Donating to their cause can help them fix things faster.\n\nVolunteer at the Bahamas Red Cross\n\nIn addition to donating toiletries, non-perishable food items, and money to provide hurricane relief, you can also volunteer with the Red Cross. There are multiple volunteer programs you can join, listed here:\n\nDisaster Management\n\nTeam First Aid & CPR\n\nAmbulance Services\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nAdministration\n\nSocial Services\n\nGeneral Management\n\nYouth Services\n\nFundraising\n\nGoverning Board\n\nIf you wish to volunteer, you can sign up on the Bahamas Red Cross official website.\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The hurricane has killed five people and is headed toward the US.", "authors": ["Starr Bowenbank"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m9cXXgxJSuYbCgj5h18KrA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/house_beautiful_336/659d4ceb26185bcd8b363fba9960329b", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
