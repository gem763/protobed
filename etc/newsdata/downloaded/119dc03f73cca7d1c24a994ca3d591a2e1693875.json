Senator Helms was an ardent supporter of America\u2019s veterans and took particular pride in making sure that every former service member could rely on his assistance and intervention to make sure that they received the best possible care. Secretary Wilkie knows Senator Helm\u2019s commitment to this issue better than anyone having served as Counsel to the Senator.\n\nPlease join us as Secretary Wilkie discusses the progress he has made in reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs to make sure that the brave men and women who serve in America\u2019s armed forces who sacrifice so much for our safety and security receive the care and benefits they have earned.\n\nFor more information about the Jesse Helms Center, please visit online at www.jessehelmscenter.org.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-1157263286.jpg?itok=ZKYomnrJ", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
