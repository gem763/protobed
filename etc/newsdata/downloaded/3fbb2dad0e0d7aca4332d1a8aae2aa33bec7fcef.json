The Bahamas government issued a tropical storm warning for several islands, including the Abacos and Grand Bahama, which were hard hit by Dorian, forecasters said.\n\n\u201cThe disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm and bring tropical storm-force winds to portions of the northwest Bahamas within 36 hours,\u201d forecasters said.\n\nThat forecast was a major concern for officials in the Bahamas who are worried about the islands\u2019 ability to withstand another battering, even if not hurricane-strength. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take it seriously,\u201d said Duane Sands, minister of health in the Bahamas. \u201cIt also impacts the day-to-day reality of the people whose roofs have been blown off their homes. Now that they\u2019ve been traumatized, this could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201d Some 5,000 people had been evacuated because of Dorian as of Tuesday, according to the latest situation report from the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. Roughly 2,000 were staying in shelters, and an estimated 15,000 were in need of aid, it said. The death toll from Dorian stood at 50, though officials expect that number to rise significantly. Mr. Sands said he has seen lists of \u201cmany, many, many hundreds\u201d of people reported missing. Confirming whether those people perished is a daunting task. Search teams are combing the rubble, but they must move slowly to avoid damaging any human remains, Mr. Sands said. The health minister said he fears many people were swept into the sea by massive storm surges and may never be found. \u201cThe ocean came in during the storm and then it receded, so you don\u2019t know what happened to a number of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat their remains will definitely be on land may be a bit of a stretch.\u201d Write to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
