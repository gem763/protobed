It wasn\u2019t. https://t.co/0FTz9jj5Cf \u2014 Caitlin Yilek (@hausofcait) October 24, 2019\n\nConway warned Yilek that \u201cif you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here.\u201d\n\nShe also claimed her attorney husband \u201cgets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed. Not the other way around.\u201d\n\n\u201cKellyanne really covering herself in glory here,\u201d one person responded on Twitter. Others described Conway\u2019s call as \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and \u201cmostly embarrassing and sad.\u201d\n\nKellyanne really covering herself in glory here https://t.co/p4jI7E4RPf \u2014 Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) October 24, 2019\n\nmy favorite part is when Kellyanne says \u201cnobody read your story\u201d \u2014 in the middle of a 7+ minute call belittling the reporter for that story. \u2014 Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) October 24, 2019\n\nThis is about power... It's about powerful people (like Kellyanne) trying to push around and intimidate people they perceive to be less powerful. https://t.co/MECJVMm1uY \u2014 Matt Lewis (@mattklewis) October 24, 2019\n\nThe Kellyanne call is mostly embarrassing and sad. But it's also a senior official threatening to investigate the private lives of journalists who dare ask questions - from a White House with no scruples, facing impeachment for seeking dirt on an opponent's son. \u2014 Jon Lovett (respookted on BOOth sides) (@jonlovett) October 24, 2019\n\nin which Kellyanne Conway goes into detail on the attack at a reporter with the lead-in: \"nobody read your story\" https://t.co/Hz885ibS5N \u2014 Edward-Isaac Dovere (@IsaacDovere) October 24, 2019\n\nUS regime official threatens news reporter for doing her job. https://t.co/UHcrvSyFBh \u2014 Bahman Kalbasi (@BahmanKalbasi) October 24, 2019\n\nWhen you've lost The Washington Examiner ... https://t.co/I6eLsYwJar \u2014 Greg Toppo (@gtoppo) October 24, 2019\n\nKellyanne Conway thinks she's the Public Editor of the Washington Examiner https://t.co/avvhtLqeNX \u2014 marisa kabas (@MarisaKabas) October 24, 2019\n\nThe Apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the boss\u2019 tree. #kellyanneconway https://t.co/ncKMwCUZH1 \u2014 Front Page Live (@frontpage_live) October 24, 2019\n\nIt is good to know that Kelly Anne\u2019s values are both personally and professionally aligned. https://t.co/ChxazTRFQW \u2014 Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) October 24, 2019\n\nI wish I could be surprised, but the bar for surprises coming from the WH is tremendously high now.
