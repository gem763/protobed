Pranjal Patil, First Visually Impaired IAS Officer, Takes Charge", "language": "en", "text": "With passion and determination, anything is possible! Recently, Pranjal Patil became India's first visually impaired woman IAS officer, who took charge as sub-collector of Kerala\u2019s Thiruvananthapuram district. Here\u2019s her story...\n\nMeet Pranjal Patil, the country\u2019s new hero!\n\nPranjal, the country\u2019s newfound hero, hails from Ulhas Nagar in Maharashtra. She lost her vision at the age of six due to direct exposure to sunlight, but her spirit was undefeated. The relentless young woman studied in Kamala Mehta Dadar School for the blind, and during those years, underwent several operations to reattach her retinas, all of which were unfortunately unsuccessful.\n\nExplaining her journey to a leading daily, Pranjal said: \u201cI had high-powered glasses since I was a child, and then I lost sight in both my eyes in quick succession. Despite that, I was carrying on with my daily activities as usual, and because I was young, it didn\u2019t impact me as such. When the surgeries were done, I did suffer a lot. The pain did not subside until at least a year after the surgery.\u201d\n\nPranjal\u2019s inspiring journey to becoming an IAS officer\n\nAfter completing her schooling, followed by a B.A. in Political Science from St. Xavier\u2019s College, Mumbai, Pranjal went on to enroll for a masters in International Relations from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Post that, she was admitted into an integrated M.Phil. and Ph.D. programme.\n\nTalking about what motivated her to pursue a career in civil services, Pranjal revealed: \u201cMy exposure to the culture of JNU helped build confidence in my mind to work for the right cause. The vibrant environment of the university taught me to form opinions and ask the right questions; this gave me the courage to be a civil service officer. While I had decided to write the UPSC exam when I was doing my graduate degree, I had made up my mind by the time I was in JNU.\u201d\n\nLiving the life she imagined\n\nDuring her time at JNU, Pranjal claims she believed that attending too many coaching classes would have ruined her overall experience, and she would \u201cmiss out\u201d on all the fun. She said: \u201cIf I were to attend coaching classes, I would miss out on several aspects of my life as a JNU student. I did solve mock papers and attended discussions, though.\u201d Pranjal cracked the exam on her first attempt in 2016, where she was placed 773rd. She went on to securing the 124th place in 2017.\n\nIn a country like ours, where often, children are pushed into becoming doctors and engineers--the only socially acceptable jobs that Indian parents can enjoy boasting about--Pranjal\u2019s take is refreshing and relevant. She told a newspaper: \u201cNo individual should be pressured into doing something forcibly. Instead of succumbing to competition, one should focus on sharpening their skills and working on their weaknesses. This would, in turn, let a person function to their full potential.\u201d\n\nA solid support system\n\nAs Pranjal officially stepped into her role as sub-collector on 14 October 2019, she shared how her parents\u2019 support has played an important role in her success. \u201cMy parents have always supported me, despite the tough challenges we\u2019ve had to face. It\u2019s just that with effort, we all will get that one big breakthrough that we want. We never felt defeated and we never gave up.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old will hold the position of Assistant Collector for a year, as part of her training period, whose first leg she completed at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie. After her field-training in Kochi, she will head back to Mussoorie next year to wrap up her training, at the end of which she is expected to submit a dissertation.\n\n\u201cI expect a lot of support from the people of Thiruvananthapuram and the staff here to be able to work for the people,\u201d Pranjal said, post signing the Report of Transfer of Charge to take over from Sam Cleetus, the Deputy Collector (Land Acquisition), who had been holding charge of Sub-Collector.\n\nHere\u2019s wishing this go-getter all the best in her future endeavours!\n\n\n\n", "description": "Pranjal Patil has become India\u2019s very first visually impaired IAS Officer, who took charge as sub-collector of Kerala\u2019s Thiruvananthapuram district.
