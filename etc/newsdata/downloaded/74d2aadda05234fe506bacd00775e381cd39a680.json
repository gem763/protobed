Photo: Netflix\n\nFor decades, few things have been more vital to a TV network\u2019s bottom line than its ability to craft a strong comedy brand. ABC dominated the late \u201970s ratings in large measure because of Tuesday night sitcoms like Three\u2019s Company and Laverne & Shirley. Similarly, NBC\u2019s Nielsen hegemony through big chunks of the \u201980s and \u201990s and \u201900s can be traced back to the appeal of its \u201cMust-See TV\u201d formula of smart, sophisticated half-hours, ranging from Cheers and Seinfeld to The Office. These days, relative newcomer Netflix has also been trying to forge its own comedy connection with audiences \u2014 but not in the same way its linear competitors did. The streaming giant doesn\u2019t want to be known for any one particular kind of comedy. It wants to be the home of all the comedy brands.\n\nThis refusal to pick a particular comedy lane isn\u2019t surprising: The streamer\u2019s well-stated goal is not to simply become a better version of HBO or NBC, but to replace traditional TV as the dominant form of video entertainment. So just as Netflix\u2019s film slate varies widely from Oscar contenders like The Irishman to the tween-friendly Tall Girl, its current and upcoming half-hour comedy offerings strive to be equally eclectic. \u201cWe want to have everyone\u2019s favorite show,\u201d says Jane Wiseman, Netflix VP of original comedy series.\n\nThat maximalist goal means the same platform that made the critically acclaimed Master of None and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is equally invested in reaching viewers who might have watched ABC\u2019s TGIF comedies (had they been alive in the \u201990s) via shows such as Family Reunion and the upcoming Wanda Sykes/Mike Epps\u2013led The Upshaws. If adult-oriented animated comedies that would be right at home on Fox\u2019s Sunday lineup (Big Mouth, F Is for Family) aren\u2019t your jam, the Netflix comedy machine will soon offer The Crew, a Kevin James\u2013led family sitcom that sounds like it would be right at home on CBS. (The Eye\u2019s older audience is also likely to appreciate actors over 70 headlining the long-running Grace & Frankie and the Chuck Lorre\u2013created The Kominsky Method, whose second season just premiered). There\u2019s even a show for Must-See TV lovers who binge The Office on Netflix, but are already mourning its pending departure from the service: Steve Carell has signed on to star in Space Force, which is being produced by American Office creator Greg Daniels.\n\nWhile Netflix strives to tickle all the funny bones, its 2019 slate has been marked by several new shows that blur the lines between comedy, drama, and even sci-fi. Russian Doll, Dead to Me, and this month\u2019s Paul Rudd\u2013led Living With Yourself very much feel like projects that not long ago would\u2019ve been made into movies instead of episodic comedies. Indeed, Tim Greenberg, the creator of Living With Yourself, says he thinks Netflix has played a key role in expanding the definition of what makes a TV comedy. Ideas like the one at the heart of his show \u2014 Rudd plays a man who ends up co-existing with his own clone \u2014 have been a staple in cinema for at least a few decades, he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure it goes back even further, but all of Charlie Kaufman\u2019s movies, Groundhog Day, The Truman Show, those kinds of movies are very similar to this,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cThose are all comedies that really have a very central, interesting and strong point of view, call it existential or maybe metaphysical.\u201d\n\nAlthough Greenberg spent years working as an executive producer on The Daily Show, he had always figured a move into fiction would mean writing feature screenplays. \u201cFor years, I thought I was going to be doing movies. I couldn\u2019t see a place for myself in TV,\u201d he says. But the rise of platforms such as Netflix, with their big ambitions and even bigger budgets, means television \u201chas expanded tremendously what it\u2019s willing to do. I don\u2019t think [this] kind of genre is new, but I think TV\u2019s ability to deliver those kinds of stories has hugely changed.\u201d\n\nLiving With Yourself had originally been set up at cable\u2019s IFC, which actually paid Greenberg to write the entire first season. \u201cWe were going to film it, and then their money just went away,\u201d he says. \u201cThey got their budgets cut. Netflix has budgets, too \u2014 believe me, I know that very well now \u2014 but I just think that they have that kind of energy from the ground up that feels a little more daring.\u201d And despite Netflix\u2019s reputation of late as a programming colossus, Greenberg says working there didn\u2019t feel like toiling at a content factory. \u201cIt\u2019s not a giant,\u201d he says. \u201cAt least the executives I dealt with, it wasn\u2019t that many people. It feels like the whole department is fairly small, and that if you\u2019re talking to one person, you\u2019re kind of talking to everybody.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how Wiseman says she set up her comedy production and development engine. \u201cI\u2019ve structured my larger comedy team into three groups with their own strategies: adult live-action, adult animation, and family sitcoms and kids,\u201d she says. As at other Netflix divisions, the heads each unit has the power to greenlight projects without getting Wiseman to sign off. But Wiseman, whose past life a network development exec saw her working on shows such as Arrested Development, Community, and Parks and Recreation, still sets the overall direction for Netflix\u2019s domestic comedy output. Vulture recently caught up with Wiseman to talk about how Living With Yourself made its way to the service, as well as a broad range of other topics, including whether she still wants to make shows that run for more than a few seasons and why she\u2019s not giving up on multi-camera comedies even after canceling One Day at a Time.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not a big deal in an age where Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are doing TV, but getting Rudd to do a TV comedy really does feel notable. Do Netflix\u2019s huge budgets and big reach make it easier to go after someone like him for a show like Living With Yourself?\n\nWe always reach for the stars, literally. The idea that you can entice someone like Paul Rudd to do a television series is a testament to Netflix, I think, because we do attract talent. We have a platform that speaks to people on a global scale. And I think that\u2019s what excited Paul about it as well.\n\nThink about it: Steve Carell wanted to come back to TV and he was specifically looking for something on Netflix. The fact that we have Space Force in production right now, it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s so incredibly exciting, the level of talent that we can attract to us.\n\nBut is it getting harder to attract that talent? There are so many more platforms now willing to offer the same creative freedom and the financial resources.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of competition, and we welcome it. But we\u2019ve been doing this now for six years, so we really got ahead of it early. We\u2019ve been taking these huge swings, whether it\u2019s Russian Doll or Stranger Things or Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. We\u2019re giving these really talented people a place to tell their stories and have a great time doing it.\n\nBrendan Sexton III and Natasha Lyonne in Russian Doll.

You have the advantage of just charging ahead most of the time, making a ton of shows, and if something doesn\u2019t work, well, on to the next one. Is that how you think of it?\n\nI\u2019ve been working in comedy for 18 years. And for the first 12 that I worked in network comedy, I worked and developed five series that went a second season. At Netflix, in half that time, we\u2019ve launched over 20 series that have gone onto a second, third, and sometimes fifth, sixth, and seventh [season]. So I don\u2019t actually think about it in terms of, \u201cIs this show going to go one season or not?\u201d\n\nWhen you were in the network world deciding which projects to take up to your boss, you obviously did have more of a fear of failure, right?\n\nAre you kidding? [Laughs.] There is such a high failure rate in network TV. We did our best. The idea of making ten pilots a year and two series getting picked up, that\u2019s a different model than going straight to series. The time I spent in network before Netflix, I definitely had some real high points with Parks and Rec and Community and The Bernie Mac Show, and of course, Arrested Development, which I worked on both at Fox and at Netflix. But it\u2019s just a different world now.\n\nMy point is, when you were in network TV, you had to be a politician in terms of thinking about what\u2019s going to work and fit into the brand. Now you don\u2019t, at least not in the same way.\n\nIn my old jobs, it was about the demographics \u2014 the 18-to-49 [year-olds] \u2014 and trying to find this quote-unquote \u201cbroad comedy\u201d that would appeal to four quadrants and with advertisers. We don\u2019t have any of that. We don\u2019t have advertisers. I love to say we make shows for ages six to 106. So it is freeing. The first show that I did when I got to Netflix was Grace and Frankie. That felt unheard-of at the time, but it was an audience that people weren\u2019t capturing. I\u2019m so thrilled that we took a shot on that one, something that I don\u2019t think we would have done in my old job.\n\nLily Tomlin and Jane Fonda in Grace & Frankie. Photo: Netflix\n\nIs it safe to say that while Netflix doesn\u2019t have one specific comedy brand, it does have several brands?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWhat are those brands right now?\n\nOne, which really broke out this past year, is our elevated comedies, which we started five years ago with Kimmy Schmidt and Master of None.\n\nTell me what you mean by \u201celevated.\u201d\n\nThey are comedies with big ideas, often high-concept stories with universal truths and of course humor. There might be some drama or sadness as well. These stories are unafraid to tackle big life questions through a comedic lens. [In 2019], those really resonated for us. That\u2019s a great brand that we\u2019re going to keep doing.\n\nTim Greenberg said that Living With Yourself has its roots in movies such as The Truman Show and Groundhog Day. Do you think of these elevated comedies as bringing a feature film feel to a half-hour series format?\n\nIt depends on the creative vision for the show. You certainly have those themes of existentialism in Living With Yourself or in Russian Doll, but those connections are there because it\u2019s rooted in the story. We want the creative to drive the tone and length.\n\nIs it safe to call NBC\u2019s The Good Place an elevated comedy too?\n\nIt is. And I\u2019m a big fan of it, by the way! The show is high concept and tackles real-life questions.\n\nI know you won\u2019t talk specifics, but has that show worked well on Netflix and encouraged you to do more elevated comedies?\n\nIt\u2019s a Netflix original in many countries around the world and we air the show day after the U.S. broadcast. I don\u2019t think it was really an indicator that this type of content works because we had seen we could have success with shows like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Master of None back in 2015, before The Good Place was on linear TV or on Netflix.\n\nYou\u2019ve carved out two more groups within your division, adult animation and family sitcoms and kids. Tell me more about those.\n\nThe tried-and-true sitcom is something that we\u2019re really doubling down on. Mr. Iglesias, we just renewed. Family Reunion is a great show that is going into its second season. We have a show with Mike Epps and Wanda Sykes coming out called The Upshaws. We have a show with Kevin James called The Crew, set in the NASCAR world. We have a multi-cam with Dennis Quaid, Merry Happy Whatever, which will be Christmas time. There\u2019s also the live-action kids [comedy brand], where we just launched Team Kaylie. And then, of course, adult animation with Big Mouth and Disenchantment and F Is for Family and BoJack.\n\nWe just want to be the No. 1 comedy destination. We want to have everyone\u2019s favorite show. We know that people have lots of different tastes and we\u2019re aiming to really fulfill those needs. We have shows that\u2019ll make you laugh while you\u2019re crying, and we have shows that\u2019ll make you laugh from physical comedy. All of our shows have elements of humor. It\u2019s just different types of humor.\n\nBig Mouth. Photo: Netflix\n\nThe more conventional comedies don\u2019t get the buzz that a Living With Yourself or Russian Doll might, though. Have you considered doing weekly episodic releases for the sitcom-like shows? You could encourage families to get together to watch new episodes from several shows once a week, the way they did in the TGIF era. Make it a destination.\n\nWe do really want to leave it up to the consumer to watch as he or she sees fit. We\u2019ve definitely experimented with shorter orders released in batches.\n\nLike The Ranch?\n\nLike The Ranch. And you\u2019ll see a little bit more of that in the future. But as far as weekly, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s our model.\n\nGoing back to those \u201celevated\u201d comedies, what else do you have on deck?\n\n\ufeffI\u2019m really excited about Gentefied, which is coming out next year. It\u2019s about a group of people living in Boyle Heights [and] it shows a different Latinx point of view. It feels like it can break out. We have Space Force, which is ordinary people doing extraordinary things, or maybe it\u2019s extraordinary people doing ordinary things. It\u2019s a workplace comedy and it\u2019s a character piece, but it does have a big hook in the middle of it. And #BlackExcellence is a big family show from Kenya Barris \u2014 Kenya\u2019s actually playing the patriarch of the family, Rashida Jones is playing the mom, and there\u2019s six beautiful, wonderful, hilarious kids.\n\nLinear networks also do these sorts of comedies, but they often draw smaller audiences \u2014 shows like The Good Place or even HBO\u2019s Veep.\n\nPeople have the idea that an elevated comedy could feel a little bit more niche, [but] that\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019re doing. We do have those shows that appeal to smaller audiences, but shows like Dead to Me, Russian Doll, hopefully Living With Yourself really reach broad, big audiences around the world.\n\nSome of the shows you\u2019ve mentioned star comics who\u2019ve done stand-up specials for Netflix in the past, or even movies. Will there be more examples of talent doing multiple types of projects?\n\nThat\u2019s one of the beauties of Netflix: Our platform is open to cross-pollination between features, stand-up, sketch, docs. Aziz Ansari was on our service a long time ago with his stand-up specials, and we knew how special he was [before] Master of None. Bill Burr, who is one of our great stand-ups, we knew that people would love to see his story in F Is for Family.\n\nJane Wiseman.

Are shorter runs just the new reality of streaming, or do you think there\u2019s still a place to do shows that can run for seven years?\n\nWe try to let the creative dictate the length. It doesn\u2019t always happen. It just depends on the show, frankly. BoJack will have 80-plus episodes. Big Mouth we just renewed for six seasons. Dear White People is four years of college, [so] it\u2019s having its fourth and final season.\n\nBut some of the longer-running shows debuted years ago. Would you still greenlight a show today for Netflix that would run 80-plus episodes?\n\n\ufeffWe would! For sure.\n\nAt linear networks, development execs will sometimes telegraph to agents and showrunners what kinds of shows they want on their air. What\u2019s your role as the head of comedy in guiding the creative community? How do you shape the kinds of comedies Netflix makes?\n\nI don\u2019t just sit back and say, \u201cBring me a show with Paul Rudd in it.\u201d Or \u201cLet\u2019s come up with an idea for Steve Carell.\u201d [Laughs.] No, we have a strategy. It\u2019s something that has evolved tremendously over the last six years, listening to what our viewers want and what they\u2019re watching. Our biggest, most powerful tool is Netflix itself \u2014 the product. We really get a sense of what people are watching. Right now, we feel like there\u2019s a dearth of sitcoms that are really resonating.\n\nI know data is key at Netflix, but how do you figure out what it\u2019s saying? You said there\u2019s a need for more old-school sitcoms, and yet, One Day at a Time didn\u2019t seem to click and you canceled it after three seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s a little art versus science. There are many shows that were green lights based on gut. And there are also shows that, for example, people love The Office and they love workplace comedies when they\u2019re done well, so [we say], \u201cLet\u2019s try and find one. Let\u2019s have Steve Carell and Greg Daniels make the next great office comedy [with Space Force].\u201d It\u2019s a little bit of both, to be blunt. With One Day at a Time, we made three incredible seasons of that show. Yes, the cost outweighed the viewing, but we kept it on for three seasons because we loved it. It was a dream to work with Norman Lear, and I would work with him again in a second. So there are learnings for sure that you take away from [the data], but it doesn\u2019t keep you from taking more chances. That\u2019s the important thing.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "description": "Netflix doesn\u2019t want to be known for a particular kind of comedy.
