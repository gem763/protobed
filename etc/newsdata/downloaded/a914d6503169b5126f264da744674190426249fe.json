That\u2019s the presiding meta spirit of this magnificent, inventive, playful, exasperating film, Argentina\u2019s longest ever, shot over 10 years. In its nexus of stories, La Flor inevitably invokes the country\u2019s fabulist god Jorge Luis Borges \u2013 but as if Llin\u00e1s had given up on the metaphysics, stopped trying to exit the labyrinth and was content to watch folk passing through.\n\nThe director pops up at the beginning on a park bench to explain that its six stories, featuring the same four female actors, form a structure: four stories rising up with a beginning but no end (the petals), one totally enclosed central tale (the ovule), a closing one that proceeds from the middle to the end (the stalk), making a flower (hence the title).\n\nIt might add up, it might not. Even more than Borges, La Flor recalls Tristram Shandy, both in its loquacious literary bent (Llin\u00e1s has worked extensively as a screenwriter) and its gentle deconstruction of the purpose and proclivities of fiction. From the very first segment, a B-movie \u201cof the kind the Americans used to make\u201d, about a research institute that accepts the delivery of a sinister Inca mummy, most of the stories come larded with a melodrama that seems designed to foreground the artifice.\n\nLa Flor is terminally prone to digressions, tales interrupting other tales, such as the weird scorpion-milking immortality cult that juts into the second episode, until then a matinee tearjerker about a pair of singer-songwriters splitting up.\n\nLlin\u00e1s\u2019s fun, spirited writing stops these games from seeming arch. Unlike the social-message remit of Miguel Gomes\u2019s similarly sprawling 2015 trilogy Arabian Nights, Llin\u00e1s\u2019s motivation seems entirely philosophical. The third episode \u2013 a spy thriller, or, given its five-and-a-half-hour runtime, anti-thriller \u2013 may contain the nub regarding fiction and the point at which we suspend disbelief. One character talks fearfully of the \u201ctsetse fly\u201d, an existential affliction spies are prone to being stung by \u2013 in which either a disgust sets in with the fiction they are forced to live, or they start to over-identify with this false reality and go rogue. \u201cSuddenly that bunch of motherfuckers was her world,\u201d says the narrator of Pilar Gamboa\u2019s mute spook, undercover in Westminster. Anyone still sitting there after six hours will sympathise.\n\nGamboa is frequently extraordinary in the early instalments, especially as the spurned singer who unleashes an incredible torrent of verbal violence at the start of number two. Laura Paredes, whose serene melancholy seems to survive whatever character she plays, also stands out. Madness seemed to be setting in by chapter four, about a director under siege from his four principals, who are also witches. The fifth is a loose remake of Renoir\u2019s A Day in the Country, the sixth about 19th-century women escaping from captivity in the desert.\n\nYou will no doubt bail out at some point \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the deal. Llin\u00e1s has done enough to make sure we come back.\n\n\u2022 La Flor is released in the UK on 13 September.", "description": "Six stories featuring the same four actors unfold in inventive and exasperating style in an arthouse ultramarathon", "authors": ["Phil Hoad"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/584fc2010684e72ccb4b12cb185ae6540cae3751/181_0_2447_1468/master/2447.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8d4b09309dff50a13f5d953c0adcaead", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
