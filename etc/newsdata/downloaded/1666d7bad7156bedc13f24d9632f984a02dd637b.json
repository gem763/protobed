They would put on fashion shows in universities, schools and hospitals and would donate the money from the ticket sales and any drinks they sold back to where the show was held.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"But they would do two or three of these an evening and then be preparing all day. It was really hard work.\n\n\"They had six children and they were struggling to pay the bills and they just thought 'sod it, let's have a break' and that's what they did.\"\n\nThe family were all behind the decision to move to India.\n\nInitially, it was planned they would be away for six months, but based in Goa and travelling when they wanted to, it became a much longer adventure.\n\nPaul said: \"My dad had a Lonely Planet and he would talk to us about places and we would head there on a flight or haggling with a jeep owner to take us there, never knowing how long we would be there for.\n\n\"We went to villages where they had never seen white people, we did a lot of volunteering, we went to the slums and played a lot of cricket.\n\n\"We would meet up with other travellers. It was a really great life journey.\n\n\"We got to eat in different restaurants and go to different beaches and nature reserves.\n\n\"We were learning about nature while we were next to it, we were learning about religion while we were in a temple or a mosque.\"\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\nBut the time was coming to end the family's adventures and return to England for the next chapter in the Forkan's lives.\n\nKevin and Sandra were planning to set up a new social enterprise, this time working in schools, and the Forkans' were aiming to be back in the UK by March.\n\nTragically, the Boxing Day tsunami wiped away those hopes.\n\nThe family had spent what they didn't realise was their final Christmas together.\n\nPaul said: \"We'd had a lovely Christmas Day. We'd been surfing, playing chess and beach football.\n\n\"My sister, Jo, had visited for Christmas but left on Christmas night to travel back to India and then the UK.\n\n\"She flew from Colombo first thing on Boxing Day morning and missed the tsunami. She knew nothing about it until she got back to England.\"\n\nPaul remembers the morning the tsunami struck vividly - along with the acts of heroism from his own family and those who helped them to safety.\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHe said: \"The first thing I remember about that day is my brother, Rob, waking me up and I was telling him to leave me alone - I'm not a morning person.\n\n\"The water was coming in and he was going mental. We went to look out of the window and saw the waves.\n\n\"We stood on chairs and put our things on chairs to keep them dry.\n\n\"Then there was a much bigger wave and we just stood there, not realising what was going on or what was happening.\n\n\"Then the wave went out again, you could see there was no sea and it just felt really weird.\n\n\"You couldn't hear birds sing and everything had gone silent. It was so quiet.\n\n\"And then the big one came storming in. It tore everything out of its way. It was like an oil tanker.\n\n\"My brother saved my life. He grabbed my arm and pulled me up and out of the way. I don't know where he found the strength.\n\n\"It was ripping roof tiles off and there was a cable next to me, it was buzzing and if he had let go, I would have been electrocuted.\"\n\nKevin and Sandra were staying in a cottage in front of Rob and Paul with their two younger siblings.\n\nHeartbreakingly, the devoted mum and dad's final act was to sacrifice themselves to save their children.\n\nPaul said: \"They had lifted them on their shoulders to get them out of the room - they sacrificed their lives for them.\"\n\nRob and Paul, who were just 17 and 15, then had the harrowing task of looking for their younger brother and sister.\n\nPaul said: \"We walked out, still in shock, and found my little brother in a tree and then not long afterwards we found our sister with some surfers.\n\n\"It was such a relief to find them, Matt has chronic asthma so we were so worried.\n\n\"We were all cut up all over and we had no shoes.\n\n\"Someone told us our dad had passed but we didn't want to believe them. We didn't want to go to see.\"\n\nThen the siblings thought they had caught a glimpse of their mum and a bus and chased after it for a mile.\n\n(Image: LEE THOMPSON)\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\nBut when it finally stopped and they got on board she wasn't among the passengers.\n\nKnowing they needed to get themselves and their siblings to safety, Rob and Paul hitch hiked to Colombo and made it to the British Embassy.\n\nPaul said: \"We flew back to the UK and everything seemed to happened really quickly. We were in shock for at least a year.\n\n\"We would tell ourselves that our parents were coming home and we would wake up in the night, thinking we were going to be with them again.\n\n\"We were living in my sister's garage and after a year of that, Rob moved out. He was 18 and he went off travelling.\n\n\"I did a couple of years at college, training to be a plumber. I started working at B&Q and decided to go travelling again when I was 18.\n\n\"I travelled to Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, India, New Zealand, Fiji and America and was working in Australia.\"\n\nBut it was far from the end of the story for the Forkan family as Rob and Paul prepare to open their third project for orphaned children and local communities.\n\n(Image: JULIAN SIMMONDS FOR THE DAILY TE)\n\nA fourth scheme is already in the pipeline.\n\nThe brothers channelled both their grief for what the family lost on that day almost 15 years ago, along with the lessons their devoted parents taught them to turn tragedy into hope.\n\nRob first came up with the idea to sell flip flops and Gandys was born.\n\nPaul said: \"We used to live in flip flops in India so it seemed like the perfect concept.\n\n\"We were determined about what we wanted to achieve and we just kept pushing. We knew we wanted our products sold around the world and we wanted to keep it simple.\"\n\nRob and Paul launched their own company initially selling flip flops but now stocking clothing, bags and towels for interepid travellers.\n\nImmediately they started ploughing any profits into their projects - and have no plans to slow down.\n\nPaul said: \"We started this when we were in our 20s and I know we'll still be doing this when we're 80. This is our life forever.\n\n\"We funded a children's home in Colombo and covered all the running costs as it was on the brink of going under.\n\n(Image: LEE THOMPSON)\n\n\"We've also funded teachers. It was good for us as well because it taught us how charities operate.\n\n\"We didn't make much money for ourselves but we've always managed to scrabble something together to live off. We have people paid more than us at our company.\"\n\nBut the road to success hasn't been easy for the brothers.\n\nPaul said: \"At first, when we told people we were selling flip flops, many of them laughed at us.\n\n\"We were met with a lot of negativity but our parents always told us that we could achieve anything we wanted to.\"\n\nThe first project was opened in Sri Lanka on the tenth anniversary of the tsunami, just two-and-a-half years after Gandys had been created.\n\nPaul said: \"It felt amazing when we opened the first project. We knew we could go back to England and things were really getting done.\n\n\"It was a nice thing to do for everyone on the island. We lit candles and lanterns were let off into the sky and it was a lovely tribute to what had happened 10 years ago.\n\n\"The whole country was at the same point. It was a day of mourning and a day of remembrance.\n\n\"Everyone on the island had lost someone - a family member, a friend, someone they knew.\"\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\nAnd even the way the project is run is key to Rob and Paul, who leave the management to local people, saying they \"don't want to muscle in\".\n\nTheir company is also going from strength to strength, which they describe as a lifestyle and travel brand.\n\nPual said: \"Gandys is a lifestyle and travel brand. When you're travelling you need practical stuff but you can also wear this to the pub.\n\n\"It probably wouldn't get you to the top of Everest but it would certainly get to the basecamp.\"\n\nAnother project has already followed in Malawi, with a third opening soon in Nepal and a fourth in Brazil before the end of the year.\n\nAnd the charity will always been the main passion for Rob and Paul.\n\nPaul said: \"Opening the projects is always the thing that means the most and are our biggest achievements.\"\n\nHowever, some of Gandys collaborations has meant a lot to the family as a way of honouring their parents.\n\nPaul said: \"We're really proud of our collaborations. We've worked with the McLaren Formula One team because that was our dad's favourite, and Liberty, because that was our mum's favourite.\n\n(Image: Barcroft)\n\n\"We've collaborated with the Rolling Stones because they were our dad's favourite band.\"\n\nAnd they insist this is only the beginning for what they want to achieve.\n\nPaul said: \"We believe in getting our projects off the ground, that's what we want to spend our time and money on - not ourselves.\n\n\"Our parents instilled this in us. Mum and dad taught us that there's more to life than working.\n\n\"Losing them in the tsunami also taught us that there's more to life than material things - it's about doing things and living in the moment.\n\n\"You have to live in the moment and enjoy life. You are on the planet for such a short space of time and as long as we leave the planet in a better place than when we turned up, we'll be happy.\"", "description": "Paul and Rob Forkan were in Sri Lanka on Boxing Day 2004 when the devastating tsunami hit - it claimed the lives of their parents but the brothers have embarked on an incredible journey", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Julian Simmonds For The Daily Te", "Afp Getty Images", "Barcroft", "Lee Thompson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707535.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ROB_AND_PAUL.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
