Instead of backing a baseless impeachment effort, Biden should be answering for the only scandal that exists: Why a corrupt Ukrainian company paid his son $50,000 a month to lobby the Obama-Biden administration, and why Biden threatened the Ukrainians if they failed to fire a prosecutor investigating the company?\u201d", "description": "\u201cImagine our disbelief that Republicans called for Joe Biden to break the law,\u201d a spokesman says.", "authors": ["Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a3/73/605543f44fcba98cff7897154cff/190924-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
