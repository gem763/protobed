It's a disgrace.\n\n\"Today we are back in the birthplace of Asda, once a proud, family company, calling on bosses to respect workers and offer them a better deal.\"\n\nOne reader told Mirror Money the changes have left her feeling \"disposable\" as undervalued as an employee.\n\n\"I've been at Asda for just under five years and I\u2019m contracted to work 15 hours,\" she said.\n\nLeanne said she was given little choice in joining the new contract last year due to her university timetable.\n\n\"Everyone I've discussed it with has been told that if they don\u2019t sign the contract, they will be 'let go' of. The leaflet made that very clear.\n\nHave you been affected by these contracts? Get in touch: webnews@mirror.co.uk.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\"Most of them will be left out of pocket by it. It will especially hurt the older people that rely on that money.\"\n\n\"Some colleagues have already started looking for other jobs and others have complained to their managers who haven't done anything to ease their worries,\" Leanne said.\n\n\"We are being treated as disposable. I\u2019m trained in multiple departments and the new contract simply reduces us all to the same standard.\n\n\"You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re worth something to the store. I get more thanks from colleagues than managers.\n\n\"Being multi-trained just puts me at their disposal. It's very much drop and go and if they need me, I can\u2019t say no.\"\n\nWhat Asda says\n\n(Image: Bloomberg)\n\nAsda said the contract is about increasing the take-home pay of more than 100,000 employees through an investment of more than \u00a380million and ensuring that everyone doing the same job is on the same terms and conditions.\n\nA spokesman said: \"The overwhelming majority of our colleagues from across all our stores have signed onto the new contracts and while we appreciate that some of our colleagues find the changes more unsettling, we do not want any of them to leave.\n\n\"We understand colleagues have commitments outside of work and will not be asking them to constantly move the time they work, their days or departments.\"\n\nThe Asda spokesman added: \"This contract is an investment of more than \u00a380 million and increases real pay for over 100,000 colleagues in return for a level of flexibility that ensures we are able to adapt to the demands of the highly competitive retail industry.\n\n\"We have consulted extensively with our colleagues, the GMB and our own national colleague representatives to discuss their concerns and to give reassurances that we will always help them to balance their responsibilities outside of work.\n\n\"As a result, the overwhelming majority of colleagues have signed to this contract.\n\n\"We understand that change is never easy, but we are determined that Asda remains a sustainable business for its customers and colleagues - now and in the future.\"", "description": "Asda claims the controversial contract is about increasing the take-home pay of more than 100,000 employees and ensuring everyone doing the same job is on the same terms and conditions", "authors": ["Alan Jones", "Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Daily Record", "Bloomberg"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12941514.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Asda-store.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
