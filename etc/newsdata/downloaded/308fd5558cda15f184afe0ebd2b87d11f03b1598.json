You can form your own view.

A UK government source said he would instead do a clip in private with broadcasters away from the assembled public and press.\n\nAddressing the irregularity, Mr Bettel told the assembled media: \u201cDemonstrating is a right in democracy and it is also important to be able to exchange and listen to each other.\u201d Asked about Mr Johnson\u2019s openness to breaking the law to deliver Brexit, he added that such a move from the government \u201cwouldn\u2019t happen in Luxembourg\u201d.\n\nA Downing Street source said Mr Johnson had asked for the press conference to be moved inside away from the public, but that the request had been refused by Luxembourg\u2019s government.\n\nThe source said Downing Street took the view that the PM would not be able to be heard properly above the protests. \u201cWhat is the point of a press conference if the press cannot hear?\u201d they said.\n\nBut Luxembourg government officials said there was no room inside large enough to move the press conference to. They added that Downing Street had suggested selecting just a few handpicked journalists to come inside \u2013 but the hosts rejected this on the basis that it would have been unfair.\n\nSpeaking to reporters without Mr Johnson, Mr Bettel suggested there had been no progress in the meeting, telling reporters: \u201cI know that the UK government is unhappy with the withdrawal agreement as it stands.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We need more than just words.\u201d\n\nAn earlier meeting between Mr Johnson and Mr Juncker also ended without movement on the question of the Irish backstop. A European Commission spokesperson said: \u201cPresident Juncker recalled that it is the UK\u2019s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement. President Juncker underlined the commission\u2019s continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop. Such proposals have not yet been made.\u201d\n\nThe protesters who scared away Mr Johnson were mostly British nationals living in Luxembourg. About 200 people chanted loudly in the square outside the Luxembourg government headquarters, separated from the location of the press conference by a large iron fence and gate.\n\nThey held placards with slogans such as \u201cStop Brexit\u201d and \u201cWe are not your bargaining chips\u201d \u2013 a reference to comments by British government ministers. While they waited for Mr Johnson they listened to the EU anthem Ode to Joy played from a portable speaker system and chanted \u201cstop the coup\u201d.\n\nMr Johnson said in a private clip to broadcasters later: \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have been fair to the prime minister of Luxembourg [to attend]. I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise and points might have been drowned out.\u201d\n\nHowever, the protesters were quiet for Mr Bettel, and in fact cheered him when he came out.\n\nMr Johnson was immediately criticised by opposition politicians for the decision to skip the press conference.\n\nLabour MP Ian Murray told The Independent: \u201cBoris Johnson is proving to be such a liar that he probably promised himself to turn up to the press conference. It just shows that he has nothing to say so avoids the scrutiny.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t provide any answers to his empty promises so decides to hide. Chicken promises from a chicken PM.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has faced many anti-Brexit protesters at a number of public appearances around the UK in the past few weeks \u2013 comically dubbed by critics as a \u201cboos cruise\u201d.\n\nTom Brake, the Lib Dems\u2019 Brexit spokesperson, accused Mr Johnson of embarrassing the country in front of Luxembourg.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He is determined to drag us out of the EU, whatever the cost, and his disingenuous pretence otherwise is being revealed for all to see.\n\n\u201cThe image of the empty podium in front of the Union Jack says it all \u2013 Boris Johnson is embarrassing Britain on the world stage.\u201d\n\nBut Conservative MPs dismissed Mr Bettel\u2019s decision to conduct the press conference without the prime minister as a stunt.\n\nTory MP David Morris said: \u201cThe PM and his team are working day in and day out to deliver a deal for Britain \u2013 this is no time for childish stunts.\u201d\n\nNigel Evans, joint secretary of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, tweeted: \u201cPathetic grandstanding by Lux PM \u2013 another reason why the British people voted the way we did.\n\n\u201cWe will not be humiliated in this way \u2013 well done Boris .... you should be ashamed of your PM Luxembourg.\u201d\n\nThe trip to Luxembourg is part of a wider series of visits by Mr Johnson to European capitals in which the prime minister is trying to drum up support for dumping the Irish backstop from the Brexit deal.\n\nHe has so far had little success. Mr Johnson was told by Emmanuel Macron that a new backstop could not be very different to the old one, while Angela Merkel suggested it would be difficult to find a new policy within 30 days, considering negotiators had been trying for years.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u00a0failed to turn up to his own press conference\u00a0as noisy\u00a0anti-Brexit protesters vented their anger, in extraordinary scenes in Luxembourg on Monday.
