I always thought of it as a filthy secret, because I\u2019m northern, because I\u2019m male and because I\u2019m working class.\u201d\n\nThe 55-year-old said he had been ill with the eating disorder during the filming of Doctor Who. \u201cThe illness is still there raging within me as the Doctor,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cPeople love the way I look in that series, but I was very ill. The reward for that illness was the part. And therein lies the perpetuation of the whole sorry situation.\u201d\n\nChristopher Eccleston: \u2018I gave Doctor Who a hit show and then they put me on a blacklist' Read more\n\nEccleston wrote that he was diagnosed with clinical depression after separating from his wife in 2015, a period during which he considered killing himself.\n\n\u201cI was in a state of extreme anxiety, convinced I was either going to die or I was going to kill myself. In my despair I reached for my phone and looked up a psychiatric hospital, I rang ahead, grabbed my bag and ran.\u201d\n\nHe said that being prescribed antidepressants had helped his recovery. \u201cI am on them to this day. I could be on them for the rest of my days. I do have an issue with that,\u201d wrote Eccleston.\n\n\u201cI would like to attempt slowly to reduce the dose, to experience reality again, to see how I do \u2026 And yet, interestingly, I have received some of the best reviews of my life since I started taking them.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the eating disorder charity Beat said it took courage to speak about having anorexia. \u201cDoing so helps to combat the stigma and misunderstanding that exists around these serious mental illnesses, especially for men and boys,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWe hope that Christopher has received the support he needed and that his bravery will encourage others to seek help, as we know that the sooner someone gets help for an eating disorder, the better their chances of recovery.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For help and advice on eating disorders in the UK, contact Beat on 0808 801 0677; in the US, contact the NEDA on (800) 931-2237; and in Australia, contact the Butterfly Foundation on 1800 33 4673.
