We would like to express our deep sadness and sympathy for all those who have lost loved ones in the Lion Air Flight 610 accident,\u201d it continued.\n\nThe report released Friday by the Indonesian investigators found that Xtra Aerospace had done a repair job on a Lion Air sensor that was miscalibrated and gave a false reading that resulted in the activation of the plane's anti-stall system, according to Reuters.\n\nIt also reportedly said the company's lack of \u201cwritten procedure\u201d was not found by the FAA, showing an \u201cinadequacy of FAA oversight.\u201d\n\n\"We welcome the recommendations from this report and will carefully consider these and all other recommendations,\" the FAA said in a separate statement on the report.", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is revoking the repair station certificate of a Florida-based company that worked on a Boeing 737 Max plane that crashed last year, killing 189.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/newsletter-faa_031419getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
