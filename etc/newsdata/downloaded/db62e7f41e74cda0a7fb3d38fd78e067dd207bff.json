Mrs. Potter said she notices the senator proclaims she is \u201cwith Bernie\u201d on health care, although she has presented her own plans on many other topics, like higher education.\n\n\u201cFor such a smart person who thinks things out, that\u2019s kind of lazy for her to say,\u201d said Mrs. Potter, who wore a \u201cWarren\u201d ball cap. She and her husband said they plan to support Ms. Warren in the primary, and both expect the senator to release a health-care plan soon. Ms. Potter predicted a Warren plan would \u201cbe better than what the [other candidates] have out.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s campaign has declined to say whether it is drafting its own proposal. But her top aides have been calling health care experts in recent weeks as it examines revenue models to fund Medicare for All. A representative for the Warren campaign declined to comment for this article.", "description": "", "authors": ["Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
