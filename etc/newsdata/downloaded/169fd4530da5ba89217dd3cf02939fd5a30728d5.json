The conversations reportedly included looking into implementing restrictions on U.S. flows into Chinese companies and delisting Chinese stocks.\n\nFormer chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia Stephen Roach isn\u2019t sure if the Trump administration even has the ability to complete such a delisting, but it\u2019s clear to him that no one in the administration had thought through the potential repercussions of attempting such a coup.\n\n\u201cI think the Chinese regulatory authorities who are in charge of Shenzhen and Shanghai would be most reluctant to accommodate the misfortunes of investors disenfranchised by what\u2019s clearly an aggressive move by the U.S.,\u201d said Roach, who is currently a senior fellow at Yale University\u2019s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs as well as a lecturer in its school of management.\n\nWhen a company listed in multiple countries voluntarily delists its stock from a particular exchange, the standard practice is to relocate those shares to another exchange, Roach explained.\n\nBut China already warned the U.S. of \u201csignificant repercussions\u201d and in retaliation, could simply refuse to transfer shares, meaning investors would be susceptible to losing the entirety of the capital they invested in them, Roach said.\n\n\u201cYou pay your money, you take your chances and your deep pockets just got shallower.\u201d\n\nAs of February, 156 Chinese companies worth US$1.2 trillion were listed on the NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange and the NYSE American, according to U.S. government data. Chinese companies are able to list on U.S. exchanges through American Depository Receipts, with one ADR usually representing multiple shares of the foreign company. (In the case of Alibaba Holdings Ltd., for example, one share of its ADR gives investors eight shares of the actual company.)\n\nAlthough passing legislation to delist Chinese ADRs might be accomplished due to a bipartisan stance against China in the U.S., Roach doesn\u2019t foresee the scenario playing out. It would almost immediately lead to lawsuits from the owners of securities markets such as NASDAQ or the NYSE. In response to the threat of forceful delisting, a NASDAQ spokesperson would only say that, \u201cone critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies.\u201d\n\nClass-action lawsuits would likely be another avenue for the most powerful institutional investors to attempt to reclaim their lost capital from the U.S. government, Roach said. Blackrock, for example, is the largest shareholder in Alibaba\u2019s ADR, which trades on the NYSE, with more than 78 million shares worth approximately US$13 billion. The top seven investors each have more than US$7 billion in the name \u2014 and all but one of them is American.\n\nIn Canada, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board\u2019s third-largest investment in its disclosed equity portfolio to the SEC is in Alibaba at US$1.3 billion. According to its 2019 annual report, the pension fund has more than $50 billion invested in Greater China. A CPPIB spokesperson said the pension fund remained \u201cconfident\u201d in its portfolio but wouldn\u2019t \u201cspeculate on bilateral and multilateral trade tensions.\u201d\n\nThe reported conversations also confuse AxiTrader Asia Pacific market strategist Stephen Innes, who said that the U.S. delisting of Chinese ADRs and limiting investments in Beijing would significantly weaken the yuan. A weaker yuan would mean that U.S. tariffs in place, along with any additional ones levied in the future, would deal a much softer blow to Beijing.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want the yuan to weaken, they want the dollar to weaken,\u201d Innes said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense from day one.\u201d\n\nThe move to delist Chinese stocks would also seriously cramp the idea of a free market in the U.S., Innes said, potentially leading to other foreign companies fearing the same outcome and fleeing U.S. exchanges.\n\nBut while Innes expects Chinese retaliation should the move to delist its companies solidify, he doesn\u2019t see Beijing closing its markets off to the rest of the world. The reason China opened them in the first place, he suggests, was that it needed the additional flows to continue aggressive expansion plans.\n\nBoth Innes and Roach agree that U.S. officials likely began discussing the idea without realizing the potential for a self-inflicted blow more painful than any it could deal to China.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this has been well-thought of at all which is pretty typical of Trump administration trade initiatives,\u201d Roach said. \u201cThey rattle the sabre without understanding how sharp the edges are.\u201d\n\nEmail: vferreira@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VicF77", "description": "U.S. officials likely began discussing idea without realizing potential for a self-inflicted blow more painful than any it could deal to China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/yuan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
