Some experts say North Korea wants to show to the US what would happen if diplomacy fails again.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency said the test of the Pukguksong-3 missile in the waters off its east coast was successful and \"ushered in a new phase in containing the outside forces' threat to (North Korea) and further bolstering its military muscle for self-defense.\"\n\nIt didn't say which outside forces threaten its security. But North Korea has previously said it was forced to develop nuclear-armed missiles to cope with US military threats.\n\nThe US Defense Department in a statement said it was monitoring the situation and that it will be \"consulting closely with our South Korean and Japanese allies.\"\n\nNorth Korean and US officials are to meet on Saturday to restart diplomacy on how to end the North Korean nuclear crisis. That diplomacy largely remains stalemated after the February breakdown of a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam.\n\nRead more: Chinese troops apparently wore QR codes on their body armor in the massive 70th anniversary parade\n\nNorth Korea has recently warned its dealings with the United States may end if it fails to come up with new proposals to salvage the nuclear diplomacy by December.\n\nIn this Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, photo provided Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019, by the North Korean government, an underwater-launched missile lifts off in the waters off North Korea's eastern coastal town of Wonsan. North Korea fired a ballistic missile from the sea on Wednesday, South Korea's military said, a suggestion that it may have tested an underwater-launched missile for the first time in three years ahead of a resumption of nuclear talks with the United States this weekend.

KCNA via AP\n\nKCNA said the missile was launched in a vertical mode and that its test had no adverse impact on the security of neighboring countries. It said Kim sent \"warm congratulations\" to the national defense scientific research units involved in the test-firing.\n\nThe KCNA report didn't elaborate on whether the missile was fired from a submarine, a barge or other underwater launch platform.\n\nPukguksong, or Polaris, is a solid-fuel missile in the North's weapons arsenal. The country first test-launched a Pukguksong-1 missile from an underwater platform in 2016, and Kim said at the time his military had gained \"perfect nuclear-attack capability.\" A year later, the North test-launched a Pukguksong-2, a land-based variant of the missile.\n\nNorth Korea having an ability to fire a missile from a submarine is a threat to the United States and its allies because such launches are harder to detect early enough to respond. The use of solid fuel also increases a weapon's mobility.\n\nAfter Wednesday's launch, the US State Department called on North Korea \"to refrain from provocations, abide by their obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations to do their part to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve denuclearization.\"\n\nSouth Korea's military said the North Korean missile traveled about 450 kilometers (280 miles) at a maximum altitude of 910 kilometers (565 miles). Japan lodged an immediate protest, saying the missile landed inside its exclusive economic zone for the first time since November 2017.\n\nIf fired at a standard trajectory, the missile could have travelled 1,500-2,000 kilometers (930-1,240 miles), Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies, wrote on Facebook.", "description": "Some foreign policy experts say that North Korea wants to show the US what would happen if diplomacy fails again.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "David Choi"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d955ce6e28ccd17fd766b5f?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
