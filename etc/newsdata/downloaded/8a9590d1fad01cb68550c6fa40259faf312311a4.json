The odds are rising that he\u2019ll be convicted in the Senate.\n\nDid Trump commit a crime? The impeachment inquiry, explained Read more\n\nThere are only two questions at stake, and the answers to both are becoming more obvious to more Americans every day.\n\nThe first is whether asking a foreign power to dig up dirt on a political opponent is an impeachable offense. The answer is indubitably yes.\n\nWhen the framers of the constitution gave Congress the power to impeach a president, one of the high crimes they had in mind was acceding to what Alexander Hamilton called \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils\u201d. James Madison argued for impeachment lest a president \u201cmight betray his trust to foreign powers\u201d.\n\nThe second question is whether Trump did this. The answer is also an unqualified yes. In the published version of his phone conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump asks for the \u201cfavor\u201d of digging up dirt on Joe Biden.\n\nTrump\u2019s accusations, tantrums and defiance illustrate the need for parental control. Pelosi and Schiff are the adults\n\nEverything Trump has tried to do to divert attention from these two facts is further undermining his case and his credibility.\n\nHe\u2019s been acting like the spoiled child who gets caught with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar \u2013 denying his hand was there, blaming the person who caught him, blaming the cookie jar, blaming the cookie, throwing a tantrum, daring his parents to do anything about it.\n\nTrump denies he ever asked Zelenskiy for help, claiming it\u2019s all hearsay. He blames the whistleblower. He likens the witnesses who informed the whistleblower to \u201cspies\u201d. He blames it on a \u201cpolitical hack job\u201d. He accuses Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee and the person now in charge of the investigation, of \u201ctreason\u201d. He calls it a \u201ccoup\u201d and suggests that if he\u2019s removed from office there will be civil war. He dares the political system to stop him by publicly calling on China to help dig up dirt on Biden\u2019s son.\n\nTrump\u2019s off-the-wall accusations, tantrums and defiance illustrate the need for parental control. Pelosi and Schiff are the adults \u2013 somber and restrained. The more Trump is the out-of-control child, the more they look like responsible parents.\n\nA majority of Americans now support his impeachment.\n\nTrump refuses to allow any administration official to appear before the House committees considering impeachment. No matter, because Congress doesn\u2019t need more evidence. The cookie is in plain sight. Everyone has seen Trump\u2019s hand in the jar.\n\nHouse Democrats will vote to impeach, but will Senate Republicans vote to convict? Until now that seemed implausible. Democrats hold 47 Senate seats. If they all vote to convict, 20 Republicans would have to join them in order to have the necessary two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nWhat was implausible is now possible. If the vote were held in secret, says Republican strategist Mike Murphy, 30 Republicans would vote today for impeachment. Former Republican senator Jeff Flake puts the likely number at 35.\n\nWill they go public? Twenty-three Republicans are up for re-election next fall. Most are from red states that support Trump. But in a few months they\u2019ll be safe from primary challenges. They\u2019ll be free to vote him out.\n\nPlay Video Trump says Schiff should be forced to resign and looked at for 'treason' \u2013 video\n\nOthers \u2013 Susan Collins of Maine, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rob Portman of Ohio, for example \u2013 are from purple states where they\u2019ll be challenged by a Democrat and have every incentive to vote Trump out. Trump has no leverage over long-serving senators planning to retire, such as Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.\n\nHow impeachment works: the steps that could lead to Trump's removal Read more\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s losing support among responsible Senate Republicans like Mitt Romney of Utah, who calls his actions \u201ctroubling in the extreme\u201d, Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse, who urges colleagues not to \u201ccircle the wagons\u201d, and intelligence chair Richard Burr of North Carolina, who vows to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of what happened.\n\nTrump remains hugely popular among Republican voters but most of them care more about the economy than about Trump, and the economy is slowing \u2013 in large part because of Trump\u2019s trade wars.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is contracting. Spending on warehouses, offices and factories is falling. Agriculture is taking a big hit. A fifth of the economy is effectively in recession. In September, wage growth slowed to weakest pace in more than a year.\n\nIt\u2019s still unlikely Trump will be pushed out of office before the 2020 election but the odds are rising by the day. And Trump knows it, which is causing him to behave more like a wild child who deserves to be impeached.", "description": "Don\u2019t assume the Senate won\u2019t convict and remove a president who sees the danger and grows more desperate by the day", "authors": ["Robert Reich"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f573087b215f69e422e7c306ef29b6e5d3b811/0_64_4361_2616/master/4361.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ef6ff64bd930f4aafbe08d5fc93d6639", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
