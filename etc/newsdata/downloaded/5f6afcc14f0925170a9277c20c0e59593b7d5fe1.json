Ron DeSantis signed a law stating that only felons who had paid all fines, fees and restitution could register to vote, impacting as many as 800,000 people, according to voting advocates.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling affirms the governor\u2019s consistent position that convicted felons should be held responsible for paying applicable restitution, fees and fines while also recognizing the need to provide an avenue for individuals unable to pay back their debts as a result of true financial hardship,\u201d DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre said of Hinkle\u2019s decision.", "description": "Oct. 20 (UPI) \u2014 A federal judge temporarily blocked a Florida law preventing former felons from voting if they are unable to pay court-ordered fines", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
