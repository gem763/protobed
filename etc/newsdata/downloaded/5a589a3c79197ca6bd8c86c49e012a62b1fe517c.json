Photo: John Moore/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump Jr. went on Fox News last week and showed off his utter lack of self-awareness by criticizing Hunter Biden for profiting off of Joe Biden\u2019s role as vice-president.\n\nOn Saturday, his brother tried to outdo him. Eric Trump, also on Fox News, criticized \u201cevery\u201d family that goes into politics and tries to profit from it.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\u201d Trump asked Jeanine Pirro after he attacked Democrats for the two qualities most closely associated with is father: arrogance and dishonesty.\n\nEric Trump\u2019s accusation of corruption against every political family but his own is hard to fathom if you live in the real world and see the Trump family\u2019s near-daily graft and corruption. But as he showed in his next comment, Eric Trump doesn\u2019t live in the real world. \u201cWe stopped doing deals when my father \u2026 went into politics,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these kids, they started doing deals when their family went into politics. And it\u2019s sickening.\u201d\n\nJump to 2:20 in the video for the key quote.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Trump believes the words coming out of his own mouth. His claim that the Trump Organization \u201cstopped doing deals\u201d when Donald Trump went into politics is so demonstrably false that the evidence contradicting it is available on the younger Trump\u2019s own Twitter feed. Since Trump took office, the Trump Organization has done business in Ireland, Indonesia, and Scotland, among many other places.\n\nThe timing of Eric Trump\u2019s critique is particularly galling coming just days after the White House announced plans to hold the 2020 G7 summit at a Trump-owned resort in Florida. The summit would have brought seven world leaders, hundreds of their handlers, and global media attention to the Trump National Doral. But criticism from Democrats and Republicans, none of whom bought the claim that the hotel would not benefit from the summit, led Trump to back down. He announced Saturday that the summit will be held elsewhere, but he was still feeling cranky about it Monday.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump said: \u201cWhy is it that every family goes into politics and enriches themselves?\u201d", "authors": ["Adam K.
