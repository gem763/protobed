Just like January, February, March, April, May, June, and July, August was full of examples of how the right to keep and bear arms is essential to the protection of individual rights.\n\nAug. 1; Nashville, Tennessee \u2014A restaurant employee stopped an armed robber in his tracks by retrieving a co-worker\u2019s handgun and opening fire on the robber, causing him to flee the restaurant. No employees or patrons were injured, but the robber was struck by the employee\u2019s rounds and later died of his wounds.\n\n\u2014A restaurant employee stopped an armed robber in his tracks by retrieving a co-worker\u2019s handgun and opening fire on the robber, causing him to flee the restaurant.

Since other valuable items had been left behind, the homeowner feared that the burglar might return to finish the job armed with one of the stolen guns.

Aug. 28; Dallas\u2014An 84-year-old man protected himself and his sleeping wife by shooting an armed home intruder, who then fled the property. Burglars had targeted the couple in the past and the man told journalists that he had decided not to be a victim anymore. He explained that the police can\u2019t be everywhere at once, so \u201csometimes you\u2019ve got to take responsibility of your own to protect your own.\u201d The neighborhood crime watch leader agreed, saying: \u201cIf more people would shoot at the robbers or invaders, they would think twice about breaking into their homes. [They would think,] \u2018Hey this person might be armed.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese examples show that when firearms are in the hands of law-abiding citizens, the public is more secure. When the Second Amendment is flippantly treated as an antiquated measure and serious burdens are placed on the right to keep and bear arms, the people with the most to lose are not criminals, but jewelry store owners protecting the family business and elderly Texans defending their wives during home invasions.\n\nWe all want safer communities, and everyone agrees that criminals or objectively dangerous people should not have access to weapons. For the ordinary Americans most likely to face these threats and least likely to live in gated communities or afford armed security, the right to keep and bear arms is not an abstract ideal. It is, rather, an important tool in an everyday battle to secure their rights against those who care little for the life, liberty, or property of others.", "description": "It seems as though every day another celebrity or politician demands that we place more severe restrictions on the ability of law-abiding citizens to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.\u00a0\n\nUnlike many of these celebrities and politicians, most of us do not live in safe, gated communities or spend much of our day protected by professional armed security.", "authors": ["Amy Swearer", "Commentary By", "Senior Legal Policy Analyst", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation", "Fall Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-514618034.jpg?itok=a08nkGtv"}
