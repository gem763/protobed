I\u2019ll take [a kidney] off you.\u2019\n\nThe 45-year-old wanted to try and donate his own kidney, but discovered he wasn\u2019t a match. Blunt admitted expressing his emotions comes much easier to him through music.\n\n\u2018When you realise your father\u2019s mortality it\u2019s great to take the opportunity to say the things I\u2019d like to say to him so there\u2019s a song on [the album] called Monsters For Him,\u2019 Blunt continued.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re two grown men, we don\u2019t need to say goodbye, we don\u2019t need to forgive, we don\u2019t need to forget, I know your mistakes and you know mine.\u2019\n\nThough, the father-of-two assured it\u2019s not \u2018all misery\u2019 on his sixth LP.\n\nJames Blunt opened up about his sick father on Good Morning Britain (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got songs for my children, who are hugely inspiring to me. I go away on tour a lot and leave my wife to pick up the pieces of that new family so there\u2019s songs on there for her too,\u2019 he enthused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlunt \u2013 who came under fire last week for suggesting Brexit won\u2019t change lives \u2013 also defended pals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who opened up about their own mental health struggles during a candid ITV documentary last Sunday (October 20).\n\nGood morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV while James Blunt\u2019s new album Once Upon A Time will be available from Friday October 25.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
