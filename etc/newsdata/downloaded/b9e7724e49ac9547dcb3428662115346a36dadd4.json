Ilhan Omar as an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d before broadening his attacks to the local Somali refugee population as a whole.\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s racist rant targeting Somali-Americans is just the latest example of Donald Trump\u2019s use of white supremacist and anti-immigrant rhetoric to advance his twisted political agenda by dividing our nation along racial, ethnic and religious lines,\u201d Nihad Awad, CAIR\u2019s national executive director, said in a statement Friday. \u201cIt is all the more disturbing that the almost all-white audience welcomed this overt racism and that Republican political leaders remain silent or even support such bigotry.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech at Minneapolis\u2019 Target Center, Trump prompted boos from the audience when he said the state\u2019s Somali refugees had been welcomed by Washington politicians \u201cwithout considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he boasted of his plan to slash refugee resettlement by nearly 85% from 2016 levels, declaring that \u201cin the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country.\u201d\n\nTrump vows to crack down on Somali refugees in a city with one of the largest Somali populations in the country pic.twitter.com/xXM3pffCef \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 11, 2019\n\nRebuking Trump\u2019s scare tactics, Awad warned of their consequences.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s vile views and policies are having a corrosive effect on the ties that bind our nation together, and if left unchecked by those who value American traditions of inclusion and mutual respect, will do untold damage to our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nJaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR\u2019s Minnesota branch, also called out the president\u2019s \u201chate rhetoric,\u201d raising concerns that it \u201cplaces the entire Somali community in Minnesota and nationwide in danger from the growing white supremacist movement that looks to him for validation and encouragement.\u201d\n\nAwad and Hussein\u2019s remarks added to criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also represents Minnesota.\n\n\u201cImmigrants and refugees have helped make our state a wonderful place to live and work \u2014 which is far more than this President has done,\u201d she tweeted Thursday. \u201cStop using immigrants and refugees as political pawns!\u201d\n\nThe President just attacked Somali Americans in his rally in Minnesota. Immigrants and refugees have helped make our state a wonderful place to live and work \u2014 which is far more than this President has done. Stop using immigrants and refugees as political pawns! \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) October 11, 2019\n\nAnother 2020 hopeful, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) echoed Klobuchar\u2019s remarks, tweeting that next week, Trump will bring \u201cthis same message of hate\u201d at his Dallas rally next week, though O\u2019Rourke plans to hold a counter-rally titled \u201cRally Against Fear\ufeff\u201d to \u201cshow he doesn\u2019t represent our country.\u201d", "description": "The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the president's Minnesota rally speech in which he targeted the state's Somali refugee population.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da09e1a200000d406500043.jpeg?cache=jh7xqrjhdy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
