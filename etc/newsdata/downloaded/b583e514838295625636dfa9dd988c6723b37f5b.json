A number of tributes were staged before the start of Sunday's Grand Prix, including a minute's silence in memory of Hubert.\n\nWhen the race got underway, an immediate safety car was required when Max Verstappen collided with Kimi Raikkonen at the first corner and broke his Red Bull's suspension, which resulted in his driving uncontrolled into the tyre barrier at Eau Rouge.
