The resulting company is named Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc.

The Company manufactures its space vehicles in Mojave, California, through its aerospace development subsidiary The Spaceship Company, with commercial operations centered at Spaceport America in New Mexico.\n\nVG already has customer reservations from more than 600 people in 60 countries representing approximately $80 million in total collected deposits, and over $120 million of potential revenue. The completion of this merger and trading as a public company are the next milestones on the path towards building a thriving commercial service business and investing appropriately for the future.\n\nGeorge Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic Holdings said:\n\n\u201cToday is the start of a new era for the human spaceflight industry. VG has already pioneered several important space milestones, including sending the first test passenger to space onboard a commercial vehicle, and today\u2019s announcement is no different. Now that VG is a publicly traded company, anyone can invest in a human spaceflight company that is striving to truly transform the market and be part of the excitement of the commercial space industry. I am proud of the strong flow of customer deposits and interest we have earned to date, and look forward to making the dream of spaceflight come true for our amazing astronaut customers.\u201d\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, Founder and CEO of SCH, said:\n\n\u201cSince our founding, SCH set out to unite technologists, entrepreneurs and technology-oriented investors around a shared vision. What was once a pursuit is now a successfully completed mission. We are pleased to have reached today\u2019s monumental milestone and look forward to continuing to work with the Company to transform the commercial space industry.\u201d\n\nSir Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Galactic, said:\n\n\u201cTo fellow investors, employees of VG and The Spaceship Company, business partners and customers \u2013 thank you for your commitment to our great company, which has made today\u2019s exciting announcement possible. With our proprietary spaceflight system, special airspace access at Spaceport America, globally-recognized brand and broad investor interest, I believe VG is ideally positioned to capitalize on the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar commercial space market and ultimately open space to thousands of new astronauts. Today, we achieved one mission, and as we bring more and more future astronauts to space, we look forward to the future.\u201d\n\nTransaction Details\n\nAs a result of this transaction, Virgin Galactic has received over $450m of primary proceeds and as at market close on Friday 25th October, the business has a market capitalization of $2.3bn.
