In Japan they turned this into a 2-6 finish whilst in Mexico they fared marginally better, finishing second and fourth.\n\nFerrari may now be the team to beat in qualifying, but Mercedes' race pace and superior strategy has seen them come off second best. There were a few other stand-out midfield performers, too, in this period, with Sergio Perez scoring 13 points across the two rounds.\n\nWith all that in mind, we look at how the drivers performed in those two grands prix in the October edition of our driver power rankings.\n\nThe rankings are calculated by combining a variety of factors. They take into account the adjusted performance index we used for our ratings last year (where drivers are given a handicap and rating according to their machinery), race and qualifying performance, any penalties a driver receives and our subjective rating out of 100. From this they get a rating and from that we derive our rankings.\n\nSo, who did the business in rounds 17 and 18?\n\n10.
