The London market has faced additional volatility from uncertainty about Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nHelios Towers set its IPO size at 250 million pounds ($317 million) and gave the company a market capitalisation of 1.15 billion pounds ($1.45 billion). The size was short of the maximum target of $500 million.\n\n\"There was some availability to price it a bit higher but in the interest of best allocation, management wanted to size and price the transaction to create a long-term high quality shareholder base and to see it trade well,\" said a source familiar with the transaction.\n\n\"We know it's difficult IPO conditions out there,\" he added.\n\nHe said that over 85% of the transaction was placed with long-only investors, with the five biggest investors taking over half the transaction; usually taken as a sign of a stable investor base with a core group of committed shareholders.\n\nMemories of Airtel Africa also lingered in investor minds; that company's shares dropped as much as 12.5% on its London stock market debut in June and has dropped even further since.\n\nIt has been a challenging year for the European IPO market, with investor sentiment battered by expectations of a downturn in major economies across the continent, particularly that of Germany.\n\nIn the UK, concerns about the potentially disruptive effect of a no-deal Brexit has added to the worries, and there were concerns that London listings could suffer as a result, especially with the Oct. 31 deadline looming.\n\nHelios operates phone masts in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo, Ghana, South Africa and Tanzania.\n\nIt had shelved previous plans for its IPO amid concerns about political risks in DRC and Tanzania.\n\nHelios has said it will use the proceeds for expanding its services, including possibly into new countries.\n\nThe IPO values the company at 8.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda), said the source, adding it was a \"robust\" multiple compared to peers operating in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKash Pandya, Chief Executive of Helios, said the float \"signifies our commitment to spreading mobile infrastructure across Sub-Saharan Africa\".\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Jefferies and Standard Bank were joint global coordinators while EFG Hermes and Renaissance Capital were bookrunners.\n\n($1 = 0.7927 pounds) (Reporting by Iain Withers and Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Susan Fenton)", "description": "By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Iain WithersLONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Shares in African mobile networks  operator Helios Towers were up slightly on their market ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
