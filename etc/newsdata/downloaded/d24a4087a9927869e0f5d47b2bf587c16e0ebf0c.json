Other staff say they are constantly surveilled by managers, with every minute of their time accounted for, including noting how long they spend in the toilet.\n\n\u201cReading the Daily Mirror\u2019s account of the working conditions at the factory, the staff description of it as \u2018modern slavery\u2019 does not seem inaccurate.\n\n\u201cAs well as being generally concerning, these revelations should be of note to the Government because Amazon is currently in receipt of significant Government contracts.\u201d\n\nAmazon has won \u00a3500 million of Government contracts since 2015 and one third of government data is said to be stored on Amazon cloud services.\n\nThe government\u2019s cloud service contracts are said to have grown by more than 50% in the last year.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nWatson said the \u201cmonopolistic\u201d hold Amazon has on cloud services in the UK and across the world is \u201cvery concerning\u201d.\n\nHe said it was another reason for competition authorities to scrutinise tech giants and for regulation to be introduced as soon as possible.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cAs I have argued previously, our failure to regulate the tech giants and introduce robust competition measures directly impacts on the nature of work and working conditions for millions of people.\n\n\u201cIn the immediate term however, the Government must ensure that the abysmal working conditions detailed in the Daily Mirror article are not affecting any amazon workers servicing Government contracts, and the Government should not award any further contracts to any of Amazon\u2019s business arms until working conditions have improved.\n\n\u201cI look forward to your response detailing how the Government is inspecting working conditions and confirming that no further contracts will be awarded to Amazon until conditions in their UK sites have improved.\u201d", "description": "The move comes after a Mirror investigation into working conditions at the Amazon facility in Tilbury, Essex", "authors": ["Matthew Young", "Image", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20691663.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FRANCE-US-ECONOMY-TECHNOLOGY-AMAZON.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
