News Group, which published the News of the World until its closure as well as the Sun, confirmed a claim had been issued.\n\nThe claims could refer to historical cases. Harry and his brother, Prince William, were at the centre of a series of hacking allegations after it emerged in the early 2000s that tabloid journalists were routinely accessing public figures\u2019 voicemails to find stories.\n\nThe claims were filed by Clintons, a law firm that has brought multiple phone-hacking claims in the past and won substantial payouts on behalf of its clients.\n\nThe filings were made days before Meghan launched a separate legal action against the Mail on Sunday for alleged breach of privacy and copyright infringement over its decision to publish a private letter she had sent to her estranged father.\n\nCourt filings of 27 September, first reported by Byline Investigates, suggest two separate claims were made in the prince\u2019s name against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers and the Reach plc subsidiary MGN Ltd last week.\n\nHarry and Meghan are celebrities, but that doesn\u2019t mean they owe us everything | Gaby Hinsliff Read more\n\nIssuing proceedings is the first court step of possible legal action against a defendant. Once papers are lodged with the court, the claimant has four months to decide whether to proceed with the action by serving the defendant. Until that action has been taken, it would be possible for a defendant to be unaware of the content of the claim.\n\nMeghan\u2019s decision to sue the publisher of the Mail on Sunday \u2013 announced as Harry launched a deeply personal attack on the British tabloid press \u2013 was widely viewed as a significant shift in the couple\u2019s approach to privacy issues.\n\nIn that case, Meghan and Harry, who are on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, employed the libel lawyers Schillings using private funds.\n\nHarry accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d.\n\nEmphasising his respect for the importance of \u201cobjective, truthful reporting\u201d, he added: \u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\n\n\u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nHostilities between Harry and the tabloid press have been escalating since his relationship with Meghan began. When the story that the two were a couple broke, he criticised \u201cracial overtones\u201d in reporting.\n\nLast week, it emerged he had complained to the BBC for broadcasting and publishing online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a \u201crace traitor\u201d and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head.\n\nAlthough the BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog, Ofcom, rejected the complaint, ruling the use of the image in a report about the activities of the group was in the public interest, the BBC apologised for not warning the prince in advance.", "description": "Royal continues fight with UK newspapers after attacking treatment of his wife, Meghan", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Caroline Davies"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f855f0d65bc60b501e1a5be275fbe4215ae9351/0_190_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=217e7a8d21b7c841ec20d4c98ea0c7ac", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
