According to a new set of terms and conditions for the plan that the company published back in August, Spotify is now requiring the primary account holder and everyone else on the plan to show proof that they reside at the same address, which it will now confirm from \u201ctime to time\u201d by asking users to verify their addresses, as spotted by CNET.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Spotify has tried to crack down on customers taking advantage of family plan sharing. The company sent out a similar warning last year that asked users to confirm their exact GPS coordinates, but it ended the test shortly afterward, following privacy concerns.\n\nNow, a slightly less invasive version of the policy is part and parcel of the terms and conditions for using the family plan. That suggests it\u2019s here to stay.\n\nAs Spotify\u2019s fine print notes, the shared family plan \u2014 which costs $15 and allows six users to access Spotify\u2019s Premium service \u2014 is only for \u201cfamily members residing at the same address.\u201d New accounts will be required to verify their address using Google Maps, and Spotify \u201cmay from time to time ask for re-verification\u201d of your home address. If you fail to meet those criteria, Spotify notes that it can terminate or suspend your family plan.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear to what extent Spotify will be pursuing this kind of account verification or if it actually intends to cancel accounts that are violating the geographic limits. But the new terms do state that it can.\n\nFamily plan sharing obviously costs Spotify a lot of money. A Billboard report from last year claims that nearly half of all streaming customers are on family plans, which cost far less per user than the standard $10-per-month individual plans.\n\nBy cracking down on family plan members who aren\u2019t living in the same home, Spotify is presumably hoping to drive those users to pay for their own subscription instead of glomming on to their old roommate\u2019s plan from across the country. There is the possibility, however, that these customers might be driven to a competitor\u2019s more lenient family plan, like Apple Music or even Tidal, that doesn\u2019t demand location verification.", "description": "Spotify is cracking down on family plan sharing \u2014 again.
