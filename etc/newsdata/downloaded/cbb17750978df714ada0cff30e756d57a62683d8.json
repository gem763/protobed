The form of the race was franked on Sunday when Armory, the distant runner-up, finished less than a length behind Victor Ludorum in third in Sunday\u2019s Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp and Pinatubo is already as short as 1-3 for Saturday\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come out of the National Stakes in good shape and, as per usual, he\u2019s been straightforward at home,\u201d said Appleby yesterday. \u201cI\u2019d say he has frightened off most of the opposition but, from what we have seen at the races, he has been very impressive and improved with each run.\n\n\u201cIt was great to see Earthlight win the Middle Park and he\u2019s there as one of the potential champion two-year-olds but if Pinotubo wins the Dewhurst I think that [title] is signed, sealed and delivered.\u201d\n\nAidan O\u2019Brien, who does not appear to have a vintage crop of two-year-olds, has left five in the race, headed by Wichita. Clive Cox\u2019s Solario winner Positive, who was beaten five lengths by Pinatubo at Goodwood, and Roger Varian\u2019s Doncaster winner Molatham look the pick of the others.", "description": "Pinatubo, Charlie Appleby\u2019s unbeaten two-year-old, is one of 11 horses to stand their ground for Saturday\u2019s Darley Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket.", "authors": ["Marcus Armytage", "Racing Correspondent", "Charlie Brooks", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000209609751-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1TYULLf6uJ0HC15x5gRMXPRHlEWgcACQH02ls8s96XU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
