Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D-MA) frontrunner status does not appear to have lasted longer than the time it takes to boil water.\n\nThe big news today is a poll from the far-left CNN, which shows former Vice President Joe Biden surging to a 34 to 19 percent lead over Warren, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) hanging on \u2014 heart attack and all \u2014 to third place with 16 percent support.\n\nGranted, this is only one poll, and it is CNN, but if Biden is indeed at 34 percent nationally, that is about where a frontrunner needs to be. Thirty-five percent is considered the safe zone in a crowded race.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t have an enormous amount of faith in CNN\u2019s polling, comparing the trends within a particular poll is always useful, and those look especially bad for America\u2019s Favorite Fake Indian. Since June, in this same poll, Warren\u2019s favorability number has climbed just two points, from 36 to 38 percent, but her unfavorable rating has also climbed, from 38 to 41 percent.\n\nMost importantly, she is upside down on favorability, 38 to 41 percent, and the only top tier Democrat candidate with that problem.\n\nBy comparison, Sanders enjoys 48 to 45 percent favorability rating. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is right-side up at 28 to 23 percent. Joe Biden enjoys an incredible advantage at 74 to 20 percent.\n\nOn the top four issues of the day, Biden enjoys a wide lead among Democrats. On foreign policy, 56 percent say Biden will do the best job, compared to 13 percent for Sanders and just 11 percent for Warren. On the economy, it\u2019s Biden 38 percent, Sanders 19 percent, and Warren 16 percent. On guns , it\u2019s Biden 27 percent, Sanders 13 percent, and Warren 11 percent. On immigration, it\u2019s Biden 29 percent, with Warren and Sanders tied at 16 percent.\n\nIn worse news for Chief Lies-Like-a-Rug, Warren is slipping everywhere else. Two weeks ago, in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Warren was tied with Biden nationally and even led in a number of polls.\n\nIn the seven most recent polls, however, Biden has a steady lead; in six of those polls he leads anywhere from 8 to 15 points.\n\nThe real problem for Warren, though, is that she wilts under scrutiny. As soon as the \u201cfrontrunner\u201d status swung the spotlight her way, everything that makes Elizabeth Warren a terrible candidate was once again magnified times ten.\n\nOn top of her extremist policies, she\u2019s a weak, shrill, dishonest neurotic. During this last debate, there was nothing to instill confidence among those looking for someone tough enough to take on Trump, especially when she dissembled over and over again when asked a simple question about how she intends to pay for her Medicare For All plan without raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nThe primary thing voters look for in a candidate is strength and competence. Are they strong, unable to be rattled? Are you the alpha male (or female)? But whenever she\u2019s under pressure Warren unravels like Lucy Ricardo when Ricky catches her sneaking into his nightclub.\n\nIn short, Elizabeth Warren is a mess. This was obvious \u2014 hell, everything was obvious about Warren\u2019s inability to handle pressure after she bungled the release of her DNA results last year. As I said at the time, that was the single worst political debacle since John McCain suspended his 2008 presidential campaign to run off and save the economy. She made a fool of herself, and that is almost impossible to overcome.\n\nFor that reason, I was legitimately surprised when she became the frontrunner earlier this month, but I was not at all surprised when she immediately fell apart as soon as the scrutiny arrived.\n\nShe just doesn\u2019t have The Stuff.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
