And less chatting with strangers means less flirting with strangers. The weirdly stranger-free dating world that Millennials have created provides the backdrop for a new book titled, revealingly, The Offline Dating Method. In it, the social-skills coach Camille Virginia, who works with private clients and also holds workshops, attempts to teach young people how to get dates not by browsing the apps, but by talking\u2014in real life, out loud\u2014to strangers.\n\nRead: The overprotected kid\n\nThe Offline Dating Method bills itself as a guide for single women on \u201chow to attract a great guy in the real world,\u201d as opposed to on Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or any of the other myriad dating apps on the market. At surface level, you could say, it\u2019s a guide to getting asked out Sex and the City\u2013style (that is, by attractive and friendly strangers who make their approaches anywhere and everywhere), though at times it veers into some of the same questionable gender-essentialist territory the HBO show often trod: For example, Virginia cautions her female reader against simply asking a man out herself if he isn\u2019t making a move, and advises readers to ask attractive men for information or directions because \u201cmen love feeling helpful.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy to mistake a number of tips from The Offline Dating Method for tips from a self-help book about finding love in an earlier decade, when people were idle and more approachable in public, their energy and attention directed not into the palms of their hands but outward, toward other people. The first of the guide\u2019s three chapters is all about how to become more approachable, and suggestions include wearing interesting jewelry or accessories that invite conversation, and holding the mouth open slightly to eliminate \u201cresting bitch face.\u201d (One of the book\u2019s first pieces of advice, however\u2014to simply go to places that you find interesting and make it a point to engage with your surroundings\u2014struck me as both timeless and newly poignant.)\n\nThe Offline Dating Method also gestures only fleetingly at what some might argue is one of the chief deterrents against flirting with strangers in 2019: the fact that it\u2019s sometimes perceived as, or can quickly devolve into, sexual harassment. But later parts of the book mark it as a hyper-current artifact of the present\u2014of a time when social-media skills are often conflated with social skills, and when the simple question of what to say out loud to another person can be anxiety-inducing for many. In the second and third chapters, The Offline Dating Method could virtually double as a guide for how to talk to and get to know strangers, full stop.", "description": "Meet-cutes are hard when nobody wants to talk to strangers.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_924233656/facebook.jpg?1567632139", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
