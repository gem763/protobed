But, thanks to a growing number of murals, world-renowned galleries and the Malecon \u2013 its instantly-recognizable coastal promenade dotted with photo-worthy sculptures \u2013 the city has also become a destination for those who collect art and those who simply appreciate it.\n\n\"Puerto Vallarta has always had a vibrant art scene, from the naif paintings that Manuel Lepe sold Elizabeth Taylor back in the 1960s to the modern mural movement,\" says Kevin Simpson, an expat who owns three prominent art galleries in the city.\n\n\"Traditional folk art handcrafted in small villages by Indigenous people has become extremely collectible, and new infrastructure, cellular technology and access to the Internet have made it easier to connect with these artists. This change can also be seen in their art, with new colors and materials enabling them to express their ancient traditions and beliefs in a way that rivals contemporary art. It\u2019s very exciting.\"\n\nHere are 10 must-see pieces that represent the eclectic artwork that defines Puerto Vallarta.\n\n\"Caballito de Mar\" and Puerto Vallarta Letters\n\nThe famous Seahorse Statue welcomes you to Puerto Vallarta \u2014 Photo courtesy of Ben Matthews\n\nThe original sculpture, \"El Nino sobre el Caballo de Mar\" by Rafael Zamarripa, is located in Las Pilitas in Playa Los Muertos. After a heavy storm, it was lost at sea and the artist recreated a larger replica. The original was eventually recovered and relocated to its home, where it still stands.\n\n\"Caballito de Mar,\" as the newer one is known, pays tribute to Puerto Vallarta\u2019s welcoming nature and the fact that people always return. The letters were created by Carlos Terres and feature design elements based on the art of Manuel Lepe Macedo, the city\u2019s most beloved artist.\n\nParque de los Azulejos\n\nParque de los Azulejos is Puerto Vallarta's first tile park \u2014 Photo courtesy of Puerto Vallarta Tourism Board\n\nParque L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas has been transformed into Puerto Vallarta\u2019s first tile park, and artist Natasha Moraga has filled this mosaic oasis with lots of symbolism, meaning and vibrant color.

The beads are painstakingly set in place one at a time in a spiritual movement, creating patterns and images that were meaningful to their ancestry. Today, they also make more contemporary beaded figures.\n\nCaf\u00e9 des Artistes by Thierry Blouet\n\nAt Cafe des Artistes, the food and the decor are all works of art \u2014 Photo courtesy of Cafe des Artistes by Thierry Blouet\n\nThis iconic restaurant has been a Puerto Vallarta treasure for more than a quarter of a century, and its d\u00e9cor is as much a work of art as its award-winning culinary delights.\n\nGorgeous artwork fills the walls, ceilings and floors of Caf\u00e9 des Artistes\u2019 interior, but its outdoor space, where the beauty of nature sets an incomparable aesthetic, is just magical.\n\nViva Frida\n\nChannel your inner Frida Kahlo at a painting class at the Marriott Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa \u2014 Photo courtesy of Marriott Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa\n\nAfter being inspired by all the art you see around the city, check in to the Marriott Puerto Vallarta Resort & Spa, where the Viva Frida Package gives you exclusive access to a Frida Kahlo Portrait Art Class, complete with a flower crown.\n\nTaught by resident artist Ernesto Aguirre, this step-by-step class helps you channel your inner Frida and bring home your own masterpiece which pays homage to one of Mexico\u2019s most beloved painters.", "description": "You can't spell Puerto Vallarta without \"art\"!
