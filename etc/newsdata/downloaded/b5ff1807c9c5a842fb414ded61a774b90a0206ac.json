horizon. In our exploitation of natural resources, we are borrowing from the future, so one should treat our Earth with respect, as something ultimately sacred, something that should not be unveiled totally, that should and will forever remain a mystery, a power we should trust, not dominate.\n\nWhile we cannot gain full mastery over our biosphere, it is, unfortunately, in our power to derail it, to disturb its balance so that it will run amok, swiping us away in the process. This is why, although ecologists are all the time demanding that we make radical changes to our way of life, underlying this demand is its opposite: a deep distrust of change, of development, of progress. Every radical change can have the unintended consequence of catastrophe.\n\nThings get even more difficult here. Even when we profess the readiness to assume responsibility for ecological catastrophes, this can be a tricky stratagem to avoid facing the true scale of the threat. There is something deceptively reassuring in this readiness to assume the guilt for threats to our environment: we like to be guilty since, if we are guilty, then it all depends on us, we pull the strings of the catastrophe, so we can also save ourselves simply by changing our lives.\n\nWhat is really difficult for us (at least for us in the west) to accept is that we might be reduced to a purely passive role of impotent observers who can only sit and watch our fate. To avoid this, we are prone to engage in frantic activity, we recycle old paper, buy organic food, whatever, just so that we can be sure we are doing something, making our contribution.\n\nWe are like a soccer fan who supports his team in front of a TV screen at home, shouting and jumping from his seat, in a superstitious belief that this will somehow influence the outcome.\n\nIt is true that the typical form of fetishist disavowal around ecology is: \u201cI know very well (that we are all threatened), but I don\u2019t really believe it (so I am not ready to do anything really important like changing my way of life).\u201d\n\nBut there is also the opposite form of disavowal: \u201cI know very well that I cannot really influence the process which can lead to my ruin (like a volcanic outburst), but it is nonetheless too traumatic for me to accept this, so I cannot resist the urge to do something, even if I know it is ultimately meaningless.\u201d\n\nIs it not for that reason we buy organic food? Who really believes that the half-rotten and expensive \u201corganic\u201d apples are really healthier? The point is that, by way of buying them, we do not just buy and consume a product \u2013 we simultaneously do something meaningful, show our care and global awareness, we participate in a large collective project.\n\nThe predominant ecological ideology treats us as a priori guilty, indebted to Mother Nature, under the constant pressure of the ecological superego agency which addresses us in our individuality: \u201cWhat did you do today to repay your debt to nature? Did you put all your newspapers into a proper recycling bin? And all the bottles of beer or cans of Coke? Did you use your bike or public transport instead of your car? Did you open the windows wide rather than firing up the air conditioning?\u201d\n\nThe ideological stakes of such individualisation are easy to see: I get lost in my own self-examination instead of raising much more pertinent global questions about our entire industrial civilization.\n\nEcology thus lends itself easily to ideological mystification. It can be a pretext for New Age obscuration (the praising of the pre-modern etc), or for neocolonialism (developed world complaints of the threat of rapid growth in developing countries such as Brazil or China), or as a cause to honour \u201cgreen capitalists\u201d (buy green and recycle, as if taking into account ecology justifies capitalist exploitation). All of these tensions exploded in our reactions to the recent Amazon fires.\n\nThere are five main strategies to distract from the true dimensions of the ecological threat. First there is simple ignorance: it\u2019s a marginal phenomenon, not worthy of our preoccupation, life goes on, nature will take care of itself.\n\nSecond, there is the belief that science and technology can save us. Third, that we should leave the solution to the market (with higher taxation of polluters, etc). Fourth, we resort to the superego pressure on personal responsibility instead of large systemic measures (each of us should do what we can \u2013 recycle, consume less, etc).\n\nAnd fifth, perhaps the worst, is the advocating of a return to natural balance, to a more modest, traditional life by means of which we renounce human hubris and become again respectful children of our Mother Nature.\n\nThis whole paradigm of Mother Nature derailed by our hubris is wrong. The fact that our main sources of energy (oil, coal) are remnants of past catastrophes which occurred prior to the advent of humanity is a clear reminder that Mother Nature is cold and cruel.\n\nThis, of course, in no way means that we should relax and trust our future: the fact that it is not clear what is going on makes the situation even more dangerous. Plus, as it is fast becoming evident, migrations (and walls meant to prevent them) are getting more and more intertwined with ecological disturbances like global warming. The ecological apocalypse and the refugees apocalypse are more and more overlapping in what Philip Alston, a UN special rapporteur, described entirely accurately:\n\n\u201cWe risk a \u2018climate apartheid\u2019 scenario,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.\u201d\n\nThose least responsible for global emissions also have the least capacity to protect themselves.\n\nSo, the Leninist question: what is to be done? We are in a deep mess: there is no simple \u201cdemocratic\u201d solution here. The idea that people themselves (not just governments and corporations) should decide sounds deep, but it begs an important question: even if their comprehension is not distorted by corporate interests, what qualifies them to pass judgement in such a delicate matter?\n\nWhat we can do is at least set the priorities straight and admit the absurdity of our geopolitical war games when the very planet for which wars are fought is under threat.\n\nIn the Amazon, we see the ridiculous game of Europe blaming Brazil and Brazil blaming Europe. It has to stop. Ecological threats make it clear that the era of sovereign nation states is approaching its end \u2013 a strong global agency is needed with the power to coordinate the necessary measures. And does such the need for such an agency point in the direction of what we once called \u201ccommunism\u201d?", "description": "Talk of a climate crisis moves to the top of the agenda again, just as the burning of the Amazon forests drifts from our headlines.
