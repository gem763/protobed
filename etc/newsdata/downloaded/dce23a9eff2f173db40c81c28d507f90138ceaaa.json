I\u2019m not comfortable with that, I\u2019m just not. It\u2019s really in your face,' Republican State Representative Curt Webb of Utah told the Salt Lake Tribune.\n\nThe legislation in Idaho only exempted breastfeeding women from indecent exposure and obscenity laws, rather than establishing a right, a compromise that had to be reached in order to placate Republicans in the statehouse.l\n\nSpeaking her mind: The Charmed star has long been an advocate for feminist social causes. In October 2017 she helped re-launch the #MeToo movement, created in 2006 by Tarana Burke, with a tweet; pictured October 16\n\nIn addition to her advocacy to normalize breastfeeding, Alyssa has been a vocal advocate in defense of legal abortion and the US Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nEarlier this year she revealed that she had two abortions within months of each other in 1993 after her birth control methods failed.\n\nShe's also noted for re-launching the #MeToo movement, which was originally created in 2006 by Tarana Burke.\n\n'If you\u2019ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write \"me too\" as a reply to this tweet,' she tweeted in October 2017.\n\nShe also shared a screenshot of text reading, 'If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote \"Me too.\" as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.'", "description": "Alyssa Milano shared a throwback photo of her nursing to celebrate the legalization of public breastfeeding in all 50 states.
