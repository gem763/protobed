Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) took the stage Saturday, a huge roar came from the left bleachers, where his supporters had packed the stadium seats at the SNHU Arena. And later, when the name of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was announced, the entire area erupted, with thousands banging together inflatable \u201cthunder sticks\u201d emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cWin With Warren.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people are looking for a safe harbor, it\u2019s Joe Biden. If they\u2019re looking for change \u2014 which really won\u2019t be much quieter than what we have now \u2014 then it\u2019s Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Howard Cunningham, a New Hampshire delegate. \u201cIt depends what you want out of your government in terms of the near future.\u201d\n\nWhile Sanders and Warren, who are the most liberal in the field, don\u2019t lead in early polls, the overwhelming response suggested some blend of superior organization from the campaigns and untapped excitement from the most plugged-in voters and party activists who attended Saturday\u2019s event. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that both are from states that border New Hampshire.\n\nBoth are potent forces who are likely to continue to matter as the massive Democratic field narrows over the next few months.\n\nWarren, who has struggled with a notion in the minds of many voters that she won\u2019t be able to beat President Trump, tried to harness the affection that voters are showering on her and use that as an argument that she should lead the party.\n\n\u201cWe need to win in 2020. Anybody in here want to win in 2020?\u201d Warren asked. \u201cI get it, there is a lot at stake and people are scared. But we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nSanders also made case that he can win. \u201cWe are beating Donald Trump in every poll that\u2019s ever been done,\u201d Sanders said to supporters gathered to see him at a bar across the street from the convention center. \u201cThe last poll, I believe, had us up by 12 points.\u201d It was a reference to a recent national poll by Quinnipiac University, which also found Biden and Warren leading Trump by double digits.\n\n[Joe Biden, Gary Hart and the perils of being atop the polls]\n\nBiden, the former vice president, was the first presidential candidate to address the convention, and he hit many of the same themes that he\u2019s talked about before in his campaign.\n\n\u201cFolks, Wall Street did not build this country. You built this country,\u201d Biden said, offering a riff similar to one that Warren first gave during her 2012 Senate campaign.\n\nBiden made an emotional appeal to stand up to a president he feels is \u201cmore similar to George Wallace than George Washington.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s speech was met with polite applause, but his supporters said it\u2019s a mistake to read too much into crowd reaction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019d much rather have Joe, who maybe makes a misstatement now and then than a president who lied to the American people virtually every day,\u201d said Harold A. Schaitberger, who leads the International Association of Firefighters and came with a large contingent of union members to cheer for Biden.\n\nHe downplayed the outward shows of enthusiasm for other candidates: \u201cThe voting population within the Democratic Party, I believe, resides in the lane that Joe Biden commands.\u201d\n\nBut in a reminder of why some Democrats are concerned, Biden drew chuckles from the crowd when he misstated the president\u2019s name during his speech here.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Hump \u2014 if Donald Trump is reelected, Freudian slip, if Donald Trump is reelected he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden\u2019s verbal miscues prompted one competitor, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), to question the former vice president\u2019s fitness for office.\n\nIn an interview published by Bloomberg News, Ryan said he believes Biden is \u201cdeclining.\u201d On Saturday, when pressed by reporters, Ryan said: \u201cI\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s unclear sometimes when he is articulating positions. There\u2019s a lack of clarity, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nKate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman with Biden\u2019s campaign, declined to comment on Ryan\u2019s remarks.\n\nMany of the candidates with lower-tier polling numbers moved into more of a pundit role about their own campaigns.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about his lagging poll numbers, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said \u201cthank God\u201d he\u2019s low in the polls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a candidate who is ahead of the polls this far out who\u2019s ever gone on to be president,\u201d Booker said, adding that former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were \u201clong shots\u201d at this point in the race.\n\nFormer Obama administration housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said he believes his campaign will pick up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new phase in the campaign with these September and October debates as people look at these 10 candidates,\u201d Castro said. \u201cI believe they\u2019re going to try to figure out who can reassemble that Obama coalition.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has been forced to play pundit more than she might prefer lately, as reporters begin to ask about her stagnant polling numbers more and more \u2014 at almost every one of her public appearances in the past two weeks.\n\nOn Saturday, she answered again.\n\n\u201cThe issue of polls to me, depending on the polls, sample size, the day of the week \u2014 I\u2019m not riding polls,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI don\u2019t ride on that roller coaster. I\u2019m working hard. We are steady. I don\u2019t get high with the polls, I don\u2019t get low with the polls.\u201d\n\nCleve R.
