She will face Democrat Buta Biberaj, a defense attorney and substitute judge who is one of several candidates hoping to reform the criminal justice system in Northern Virginia. A group of Democratic voters had challenged Wittmann\u2019s residency, noting that her family lived in Fairfax County through August.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased; I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Wittmann, now chief deputy in the prosecutor\u2019s office, said after the trial in Loudoun circuit court. \u201cI did everything right. I think it\u2019s a testament to my devotion to Loudoun County \u2014 I uprooted my family.\u201d\n\nWittmann testified at the day-long civil trial that she moved in with a colleague, Alejandra Rueda, the same week in February that she learned that Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Jim Plowman had been appointed a judge and would leave his job open. Wittmann also changed the address on her pay stubs to Leesburg in February and acquired a remote for her co-worker\u2019s garage, she testified.\n\n\u201cI knew I needed to move into Loudoun County immediately,\u201d she testified. \u201cI moved to Leesburg as quickly as I could.\u201d\n\n[GOP candidate for top Loudoun prosecutor accused of lying about residency]\n\nOn Feb. 21, Wittmann changed her car and voter registration to Rueda\u2019s home and filed her candidacy papers. Potter cited those moves in his decision from the bench, along with the fact that Wittmann and her husband had considered moving to Loudoun in both 2013 and 2018.\n\n\u201cHer conduct clearly indicates her intent to move to Loudoun County from Fairfax County,\u201d Potter said. \u201cShe took numerous steps.\u201d\n\nPotter is a Prince William judge brought in to hear the case to avoid a conflict of interest given Wittmann\u2019s long career in Loudoun.\n\nWittmann testified that she had long wanted to move to a bigger home in Loudoun but had trouble selling her house in Herndon, a historic Victorian. She and her husband sold the house in July and, with their children, moved into a house in Sterling at the end of the month.\n\nRueda testified that she told Wittmann it would be \u201csilly\u201d to rent an apartment when she \u201chad an extra bedroom that I didn\u2019t use\u201d in her Leesburg townhouse. Wittmann only paid her one rent check in March, for $205; Rueda said she was \u201cvery uncomfortable with being paid rent\u201d because her colleague helped clean and take care of her two dogs.\n\nBoth women said Wittmann only stayed in the Leesburg house for about two week-long stretches between February and August. Otherwise, Rueda said, Wittmann\u2019s presence was \u201cerratic.\u201d She got a key made for Wittmann in March, according to the court records.\n\nAttorneys for Wittmann argued successfully that it was irrelevant how often Wittmann slept in Leesburg or whether she paid rent there \u2014 what mattered was her intention to live in Loudoun. Wittmann testified that she was in Leesburg as often as she could be and considered it her home \u2014 \u201cwith the exception of going back to care for my children.\u201d She had primary responsibility for taking her kids to school and picking them up, she said, and was also often in Fairfax to care for two elderly relatives.\n\nThe plaintiffs were allowed to analyze Wittmann\u2019s cellphone data, which showed dozens of examples of location data around the Herndon home and only two around Rueda\u2019s Leesburg home. But Wittmann\u2019s attorneys noted that she shared some phone applications with the rest of her family and that metadata can also be pulled in from downloaded images \u2014 for example, one image on her phone traced back to a location in the Bahamas.\n\nShown the longitude and latitude data on Google Maps, Wittmann testified that she did not recognize the location as her former home on Nash Street in Herndon, saying, \u201cI\u2019m familiar with multiple Nash and Spring streets.\u201d The judge did not reference the cellphone records in his decision.\n\nMichael York, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment after the hearing other than to say he would examine a possible appeal. If that happens, no decision is likely to be made before the November election.\n\nRead more:\n\nBefore he died in prison, prosecutors were trying to cut down his 40-year sentence\n\nWith a letter of support from Kim Kardashian-West, D.C. man convicted of murder gets a second chance\n\nProsecutors in Prince George\u2019s will no longer recommend cash bail for defendants\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Nicole Wittmann properly registered to vote in Loudoun County, a judge ruled.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Bhlv6RVZQC20dm7dBkiPGnXR-0s=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LDP6YJWZSAI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
