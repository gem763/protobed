Lo got in shape for her new film, Hustlers, about strippers who con Wall Street execs out of thousands of dollars. (She plays the mastermind behind the operation, Ramona.) In order to prepare for the role, J.Lo learned how to pole dance, a favorite workout among models like Helena Christensen.\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for people who do the pole,\" J. Lo told Jimmy Kimmel. In order to train for the film, J. Lo enlisted an acrobat from Cirque du Soleil to teach her how to pole-dance. She even installed a portable pole in her house. \"It's, like, acrobatic, it's a different muscle group,\" she told the late night talk show host. \"And the things that they do with their legs and everything and go upside down...it's hard.\"\n\nShe and fianc\u00e9 A-Rod also completed a 10-day no carbs, no sugar challenge (major props), which J.Lo later revealed on Ellen was to get her body ready for Hustlers.\n\nAnd while filming has wrapped, Jennifer's commitment to her health certainly has not. Just last month, her trainer told O, the Oprah Magazine that J.Lo's ab workout consists of a set of 50 hanging ab raises follower by 50 rope crunches and 50 incline sit ups with a 45-pound plate (wowza). Then, she does another set of 35 each, followed by a third set of 21 each\u2014without taking breaks.\n\nBut J.Lo's hard work doesn't just end there. The actress, singer, and dancer stays away from caffeine or alcohol, skips anything containing sugar, and tries to avoid processed foods as much as she can. For protein, she sticks to egg whites, white meat turkey, chicken breast, grass-fed beef, and salmon or sea bass. She also sneaks protein into any snack foods, like smoothies or pancakes made with protein powder.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Friendly reminder: She's 50.", "authors": ["Kate Dwyer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uqJBVEX4q1w9RLuoXEjoJg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/1a0f6670df8c45b6d3da6f4fb0416fd2"}
