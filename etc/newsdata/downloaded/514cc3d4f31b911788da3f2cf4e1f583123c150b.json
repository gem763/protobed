And the top-tier \u2014 no longer five candidates, but three \u2014 is becoming more insurmountable.\n\nFor more than a year, Democrats had approached their nominating contest with a widely-shared belief that \u2014 like Republicans in the earliest stages of their primary four years ago \u2014 they, too, might take turns rising and falling in an expansive field. That expectation sustained the campaigns of more than two dozen contenders this year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in recent weeks, the leading band of candidates has contracted unexpectedly early. Heading into the fall, only three contenders are polling above single digits: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nKamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg remain at the periphery, while lower-polling candidates have largely failed to muster sustained, upward movement in fundraising or polling.\n\nAccording to interviews with about two dozen Democratic operatives and consultants, there is little reason to expect any of them will.\n\n\u201cIt was legitimate to say \u2018Top 5\u2019 for a long time, but with the exception of Kamala Harris being at the outer perimeter of the top three \u2026 you\u2019d have to have a strange confluence of events for someone outside those four to win,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a longtime Hillary Clinton confidant. \u201cIt would require all four failing. Like, you would need all four of them to be in a plane crash or something.\u201d\n\nFor every other candidate, Reines said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late in the game to keep saying it\u2019s too early.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders speaks during a town hall meeting about climate change on August 22 in Chico, California | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBy this point in the Republican primary in 2016, Jeb Bush was already cratering. Scott Walker had risen and fallen. Donald Trump was in first, still to fend off a surge from Ben Carson before running away from the field.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic primary, by contrast, has been defined by its relative stability, with two full fundraising periods and two sets of debates now done.\n\nAnna Greenberg, a pollster who advised former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s since-aborted presidential bid, said there was no boom-and-bust for Democrats because the primary \u201cstarted so early, before voters really started paying attention,\u201d and because of \u201cthe sheer volume of candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit surprising because compared to \u201816 on the Republican side, where it seemed like a number of people had their moment in the sun \u2026 there hasn\u2019t really been anybody who\u2019s taken a meteoric rise,\u201d said Scott Brennan, an Iowa Democratic National Committee member and former state party chairman.\n\nBrennan said he's spoken with several campaigns recently whose advisers \u201cfeel like they\u2019re poised and ready, they\u2019re poised and they're waiting for their moment.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cfor whatever reason,\" he said, \"they haven\u2019t had that.\u201d\n\nIn a spate of campaigning over the holiday weekend, Amy Klobuchar released a plan to address climate change, Sanders previewed his plan to cancel Americans\u2019 medical debt and Beto O\u2019Rourke reiterated his call for stricter gun laws, telling CNN of the nation's recent mass shootings, \u201cYes, this is f----- up.\u201d\n\nOn Labor Day, the candidates fanned out across the country, with Biden heading to Iowa, Warren to New Hampshire, Cory Booker to Nevada and Harris to California. The activity came on the heels of several candidates dropping out after failing to get traction \u2014 and speculation about more to follow \u2014 reinforcing the advantage held by the frontrunners.\n\nLast week, Kirsten Gillibrand became the latest campaign casualty, a week after Jay Inslee abandoned his effort. With five months before Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses, six candidates have already dropped out.\n\nDemocratic strategist Matthew Littman, a former speechwriter for Biden who now backs Harris, described the field as \"mostly settled\" among five candidates, including Harris and Buttigieg in that group. Unlike in 2016, when many Republicans were wary of, if not opposed to, Trump, Democrats are \u201cmostly satisfied\u201d with the range of ideologies and experiences represented by the top tier, he said.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates are SOL, and it has been that way for a couple of months,\u201d Littman said.\n\nFor Biden, Sanders and Warren, the advancing calendar appears likely to compound their advantage, as early fundraising success and staff hiring allows them to begin advertising and to intensify voter outreach.\n\nThe debates have contributed to the early winnowing of candidates. Lower-tier candidates can barely focus on anything else besides meeting the Democratic National Committee\u2019s increasingly arduous fundraising and polling benchmarks for debates.\n\n\u201cIn a weird way because of the format of these debates and what it took to deal with the debates,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, \u201conly recently has anyone started spending any significant money in the early states. So, there wasn\u2019t any reason why there would be significant [poll] movement] \u2026 until now. And now, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nSen.

No one really told them, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re in a race where it\u2019s impossible for you to grow at all. There is no room.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to make the next debate, in Houston, Tim Ryan and John Delaney were compelled to release statements confirming they were still running. Michael Bennet shredded the Democratic National Committee on stage at its summer meeting, while Steve Bullock defiantly released a new round of staff hires. Campaign aides for both said they\u2019d redouble their efforts in Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe rules became a proxy for success at a moment when campaigns were just getting started,\u201d Bennet said in an interview with POLITICO. \u201cThe DNC is only interested in well-known candidates running.\u201d\n\nEven for candidates who have made the debates, their turns on the national stage haven't sparked enduring swings in the campaign. As a result, they've spent recent weeks spinning their position in the polls.\n\n\u201cWhich is more unlikely \u2013 1) going from being a complete unknown to 6th in the polls or 2) going from 6th in the polls to winning the whole thing?\u201d tweeted Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who's enjoyed improbable success but is still running at 2 percent in the latest Morning Consult poll.\n\nHickenlooper, Inslee and Gillibrand all participated in previous debates, before dropping out. Juli\u00e1n Castro sparked interest with his chiding of fellow Texan O\u2019Rourke in the first set of debates, in June. And Harris surged in public opinion polls when she criticized Biden for his past opposition to busing and former associations with segregationist senators.\n\nBut for both candidates, the effect was short-lived. Harris is now back at 8 percent, according to the latest Morning Consult survey. Castro is stuck at 1 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that they happened so quickly,\u201d said Doug Herman, a Democratic strategist. \u201cTrump has changed the timeline. Scandal doesn\u2019t last. Problems don\u2019t last. Success doesn\u2019t last. Everything\u2019s a little more vaporized in this timeframe.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden at a town hall event at Clinton College on August 29 in Rock Hill, South Carolina. | Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nThe progressive wing of the party already has two viable candidates in Sanders and Warren. For more moderate Democrats, only a Biden implosion is likely to create room for advancement.\n\n\u201cSomebody like Buttigieg or Harris, at this moment, they can only succeed with a Biden collapse,\u201d Herman said. \u201cThey have an if-then strategy. They are not in control of their destiny.\u201d\n\nMore movement will also require candidates to adopt a change in tone, said Tom McMahon, a former DNC executive director.\n\n\u201cEveryone \u2014 both in the top-tier and among the also-rans \u2014 have to start developing when and how they\u2019re going to go negative,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, this race is going to continue to remain status quo.\u201d\n\nIt is possible the dynamic will shift. Former Iowa Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack, who briefly ran for president in 2008, said that even in Iowa, \u201cmost people, other than those who are ultra-interested, and ultra-focused, most people are not paying attention to this at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an open game here,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cHaving said that, the folks who are at the bottom end of the spectrum here have got to have their moment relatively soon, and here\u2019s why: Because Warren, Sanders and Biden and Mayor Pete have a foundation of fundraising that\u2019s going to continue to pump money into their campaigns.\u201d\n\nOf other candidates, Vilsack said, \u201cThey\u2019ve got to move now, but there\u2019s still time for them to move.\u201d", "description": "'It\u2019s too late in the game to keep saying it\u2019s too early,' a former Hillary Clinton adviser says of the Democratic presidential primary.", "authors": ["David Siders", "Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/9c/e7e23a524fbab4f8b7ef5be3d76a/1992-candidates-gty-773.jpg"}
