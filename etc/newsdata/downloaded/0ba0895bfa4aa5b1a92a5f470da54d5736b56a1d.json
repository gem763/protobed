The play was initially ruled incomplete before being overturned on replay review.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were a second-half team\u201d Proche said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was anything with Tulsa\u2019s defense. We just stayed the course and played SMU football.\u201d\n\nSMU (6-0, 2-0 American) this week moved into the AP poll for the first time since October 1986, before NCAA sanctions that included the death penalty. The Mustangs didn\u2019t field a team in 1987 and 1988.\n\nThe Mustangs are 6-0 for the first time since the Pony Express days in 1982, when it went on to an unbeaten season (11-0-1) with running backs Eric Dickerson and Craig James.\n\n\u201cReally proud of the way our guys hung in there and battled,\u201d second-year SMU coach Sonny Dykes said. \u201cFor us to go down 21 and just for them to keep playing, hang in there and figure out a way to win the game, it\u2019s a real credit to their character.\u201d\n\nXavier Jones ran for 121 yards and scored two game-tying touchdowns for SMU before he fumbled in the second overtime. But Tulsa couldn\u2019t take advantage when Jacob Rainey missed a 43-yard field goal attempt wide left.\n\nTulsa (2-3, 0-1) had the ball to start the third overtime, and used a different kicker after failing to get a first down. But Zack Long was wide left on a 42-yard attempt.\n\n\u201cA tough game to come out on the wrong side of,\u201d Tulsa coach Philip Montgomery said. \u201cI thought our guys played extremely hard. I thought they emptied their tanks, didn\u2019t leave anything out there.\u201d\n\nJones had a 4-yard TD run on a fourth-down play with 1:02 left in regulation. His 3-yard score forced the second overtime after Zach Smith\u2019s fourth touchdown pass, a 7-yarder to Josh Johnson, opened the overtime scoring.\n\nThe Mustangs were down 30-9 before touchdowns on their last three possessions in regulation. They Mustangs went at least 73 yards and converted fourth downs on each of those possessions. They converted 6-of-7 fourth downs overall.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a very talented team, a team that\u2019s been playing extremely well. We know that they can catch fire and do some things,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI think it helped them a little bit in the fourth quarter being down, because every possession is crucial, so they\u2019re really playing four-down territory all of the way through it. \u2026 One stop here or there and we\u2019re off the field and it could be a different story.\u201d\n\nBuechele, the former Texas quarterback, finished 23-of-40 passing for 280 yards with both of his TDs to Proche, who had 11 catches for 153 yards.\n\nSmith was 23-of-41 for 346 yards, but also threw three interceptions before halftime. The first was returned 64 yards by Ar\u2019mani Johnson for a touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nKe\u2019Mon Freeman had a 1-yard scoring run for SMU on the first play of the fourth quarter, capping a 19-play drive with two fourth-down conversions, one near midfield on a run and the other a pass interference penalty in the end zone on fourth-and-goal from the 1. Buechele threw a 30-yard TD to Proche with 8:24 left, two plays after the quarterback\u2019s 3-yard keeper on fourth-and-1.\n\nTulsa had a 16-6 lead early in the second quarter after scoring two touchdowns with only one second ticking off the clock. Smith threw the first of his two TDs to a wide-open Keylon Stokes for a 58-yard catch-and-run. On the ensuing kickoff, SMU didn\u2019t secure the loose ball and Kendarin Ray dove on it in the front corner of the end zone for another touchdown.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTulsa: The Golden Hurricane will bemoan the mistakes that cost them a chance for the upset on the road, considering the 23-9 halftime lead despite the three interceptions and the missed field goal that would have ended the game in the second overtime. They have lost 17 in a row to Top 25 teams since a 62-35 over No. 24 Hawaii in the Hawaii Bowl on Christmas Eve nine years ago. Tulsa won the regular-season finale at home against SMU last November to keep the Mustangs from getting bowl eligible in coach Sonny Dykes\u2019 first season.\n\nSMU: This matched the second largest comeback in school history, the largest being a win at Baylor in 1975 after being down 25 points. \u2026 The Mustangs have scored at least 41 points in their last five games. While they needed two overtime touchdowns to do that against Tulsa, they clearly have plenty of offense with AAC passing leader Buechele, rushing leader Jones and two of the top receivers in Proche and Reggie Roberson Jr.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTulsa is home next Saturday night to play Navy (2-2, 1-1), which is coming off a home loss to Air Force.\n\nSMU has an open date before hosting Temple (4-1, 1-0) on Oct. 19.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Shane Buechele threw a 25-yard touchdown to James Proche in the third overtime and No. 24 SMU beat Tulsa 43-37, coming back from a three-touchdown deficit in the fourth quarter Saturday night to win in its first game as a ranked team in 33 years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/tulsa_smu_football_15837_c0-97-2316-1447_s1770x1032.jpg?65ae5d55cdd506b4b2f364736e573eeaa16c19df", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
