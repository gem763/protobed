We hope the ruling is sustained, because it is a clear and convincing affirmation of the importance of diversity \u2014 to individuals, institutions of learning and, most critically, the country.\n\n\u201cHarvard\u2019s admission program passes constitutional muster in that it satisfies the dictates of strict scrutiny,\u201d U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs wrote in a Sept. 30 ruling that rejected claims that the school had intentionally discriminated against Asian American applicants. The much-watched case was brought by a long-standing critic of affirmative action on behalf of a group of Asian American plaintiffs, and it was backed by the Justice Department. Students for Fair Admissions, which has filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, did not offer up a single Asian American applicant who was overtly discriminated against or was better qualified than a white student who won admission but instead argued that Asian Americans, who as a group get higher test scores and grades than other races, were held to standards that depressed their numbers.\n\nAdmission officials responded that they could easily fill the freshman class with students with perfect test scores but instead have adopted a \u201cwhole person\u201d review that weighs a number of variables of which race is one factor. Such an approach \u2014 in which there are no quotas or numerical scores assigned to racial groups or lowered academic standards \u2014 tracks with Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action.\n\nAnd it recognizes the positive contribution of diversity. The 130-page opinion outlines how diversity fosters \u201ctolerance, acceptance and understanding.\u201d Students who are admitted and choose to attend Harvard, wrote Judge Burroughs, \u201cwill live and learn surrounded by all sorts of people, with all sorts of experiences, beliefs and talents. They will have the opportunity to know and understand one another beyond race, as whole individuals with unique histories and experiences. It is this, at Harvard and elsewhere that will move us, one day, to the point where we see that race is a fact, but not the defining fact and not the fact that tells us what is important, but we are not there yet.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s admissions process, as the judge pointed out, is not perfect. Indeed, that the greatest advantages continue to go to those with wealth or connections \u2014 who are mainly white \u2014 underscores the need for improvement. But there must be no retreat from efforts to create classrooms that reflect the diversity of the country and that will help produce a more just and caring society.", "description": "The university is right to create a diverse student body.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0nfOaNerdD8EplXgakVpDn0fftU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3TW46BEWBUI6TELNTRQWA7MBSA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
