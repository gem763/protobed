The bilateral agreements aim to eliminate government interference in commercial airline decisions about fares, routes and capacity in order to create a competitive, freer market.\n\nThe agreements have been largely successful in liberalizing air services to the benefit of consumers, airlines and economies.\n\nA 2015 Brookings Institution study found that the agreements have saved passengers at least $4 billion by stimulating competition that lowered fares 15 percent and increased flight frequency.\n\nRELATED: Federally subsidized air service strains meaning of \u2018essential\u2019\n\nBut coalition spokesperson Jill Zuckman tells Watchdog.org that unlike profit-driven airlines, subsidized Gulf carriers can afford to add vastly more capacity than the demand in their own countries.\n\n\u201cIt is no accident, for example, that U.S. airlines offer no flights to Qatar or the UAE and only two nonstop flights to India \u2013 the second-largest country in the world. Gulf overcapacity has made it commercially non-viable for U.S. airlines to serve either market,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the Gulf carriers continue to leech passengers from routes already served by U.S. airlines, failing to stimulate their own demand and instead only feeding off their fair-playing competitors.\u201d\n\nZuckman cites recent data showing international travel on U.S. carriers and their joint venture partners fell sharply after the most recent entries by Gulf carriers in Seattle, with a 21.4 percent drop, 14.3 percent in Washington, D.C., 13.3 percent in Orlando, 13.1 percent in San Francisco, 10.8 percent in Boston, 8.8 percent in Chicago and 7.6 percent in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nAnd every route lost or foregone due to Gulf carrier subsidies costs 1,500 U.S. jobs, Zuckman said.\n\nThe Big Three domestic airlines have spent the past two years appealing to the federal government to address the disparity caused by the Gulf carriers subsidies.\n\nThe Middle East airlines have repeatedly denied accusations of subsidies and unfair competition. They say U.S. airlines simply want to protect a market that\u2019s slipping away to fast-growing foreign competition.\n\nEmirates President Tim Clark has insisted the carrier has not received more than $10 million in seed money, with the company earning profits for 28 straight years.\n\nAnd Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Akbar said in a 2015 news release that Gulf carriers\u2019 presence in the U.S. creates rather than destroys American jobs:\n\n\u201cAirways passengers support local economies in the US. In 2014 alone, the airline brought 248,000 visitors to the United States and made a significant contribution of $900 million to US economies and employment, all thanks to Open Skies. Qatar Airways currently operates over $19 billion worth of direct-purchase Boeing aircraft with future deliveries of another $50 billion to come.\u201d\n\nGovernment officials from the three countries eventually met last summer but took no formal action, effectively leaving the matter in a holding pattern.\n\nBut the battle is being drawn anew under President Donald Trump\u2019s watch, and could come to a head within days.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the CEOs of the domestic Big Three airlines sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, urging him to pick up where his predecessors had left off.\n\nThen this week, 25 members of Congress from New York and New Jersey sent a letter to Trump insisting that he take quick and decisive action \u201cto defend U.S. interests abroad and ensure that U.S. Airlines and their American workers have a fair and equal opportunity to compete.\u201d\n\nThe letter asks the president to bar Emirates from the March 12 launch of its new daily flight from Dubai to Newark. (Emirates announced the flight Jan. 23, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration.)\n\nEmirates is also dealing with the PR aftermath of its first annual sales decline in 10 years, prompting the recent Bloomberg headline, \u201cIs Emirates Airline Running out of Sky?\u201d\n\nRELATED: Feds may soon yank subsidized air service to Lewistown\n\nAs the two sides gear up for what could be a decisive confrontation in Washington, one scholar says there\u2019s a third side that\u2019s chronically ignored by politicians and airlines.\n\n\u201cWhen everyone starts talking about leveling the playing field, where are the consumers in all of this?\u201d asks Clifford Winston, Brookings Institute senior fellow and co-author of the 2015 OSA cited above.\n\n\u201cThe public does not tend to have a representative,\u201d he said in an interview with Watchdog.org. \u201cThat\u2019s the tragedy.\u201d\n\nWinston adds that given the economic success of the 1970s airline deregulation and OSAs, the U.S. should do something that would likely not fly with Trump \u2014 push for one giant, global marketplace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to finish the job and open the whole thing up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is it that GM and Chrysler have to compete with foreign automakers on our soil. Why don\u2019t the carriers have to do that? Pick an industry. We have to take the lead and negotiate and say, \u2018open up, and we\u2019ll open up.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Jennifer Aniston, the Sydney Australian Symphony Orchestra, Formula One motor .09/02/2019 3:18:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Kathy Hoekstra", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/03/Emirates-airline-300x187.jpg"}
