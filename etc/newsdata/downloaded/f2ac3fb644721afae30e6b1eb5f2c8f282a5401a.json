A statement Tuesday by the Transportation Authority says other changes to the holiday construction schedule include having crews work 24/7, promoting offers for drivers who travel at nonpeak times and moving to all-electronic tolling.\n\nThe changes come weeks after Gov. Larry Hogan directed state officials to expedite the two-year rehabilitation project that\u2019s already caused miles-long traffic jams. But transportation officials haven\u2019t said how much the changes will speed up the project, or their cost.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Maryland transportation officials have announced that major construction work on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge will no longer pause during the Thanksgiving holiday, meaning drivers should \"expect major delays\" during one of the busiest travel times of the year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
