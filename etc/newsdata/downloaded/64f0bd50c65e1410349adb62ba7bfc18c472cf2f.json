(AP) - Teddy Bridgewater probably should have had another multi-touchdown day for the New Orleans Saints.\n\nHe\u2019ll gladly settle for remaining unbeaten as the starter.\n\nBridgewater missed wide-open receivers Michael Thomas and Ted Ginn for would-be scores in the 13-6 victory Sunday, two of just a handful of mistakes for the backup quarterback.\n\nBridgewater was on target when it mattered most, connecting with Jared Cook for a 4-yard touchdown on a third-and-4 play early in the fourth quarter and improving to 4-0 in place of injured star Drew Brees.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple struggles early in the game, but great teams always try to find a way to win each football game,\u201d Bridgewater said.\n\nBridgewater closed out the victory by gaining 2 yards on a quarterback sneak just after the two-minute warning.\n\nComing off a 300-yard, four-touchdown performance against Tampa Bay, Bridgewater was less effective against the Jaguars (2-4). But he did enough for New Orleans\u2019 defense, which turned Minshew Mania into mush.\n\nThe unit sacked Minshew twice, kept him from scrambling and took away his top target. Minshew completed 14 of 29 passes for 163 yards and an interception.\n\n\u201cI told our defense I felt like if they played eight quarters they were not going to score a touchdown today,\u201d coach Sean Payton said.\n\nBridgewater was considerably more efficient than Minshew, finishing 24 of 36 passing for 240 yards.\n\nThomas caught eight passes for 89 yards and Cook finished with three receptions for 37 yards.\n\nRunning back Alvin Kamara was limited because of an ankle injury and left the game late after tweaking a knee. He finished with 31 yards on 11 carries to go along with seven catches for 35 yards.\n\nBackup Latavius Murray added 44 yards on eight carries, most of it coming in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe know that when we\u2019re out there playing it\u2019s going to take all 11 guys on the football field to win these football games,\u201d Bridgewater said.\n\nThe Saints (5-1), who play at Chicago next week, have won games a variety of ways since Brees went down with a thumb injury in Week 2. They beat Dallas and Jacksonville with defensive gems and outscored Seattle and Tampa Bay.\n\n\u201cEach week we just talk about how do we win that game,\u201d Payton said. \u201cHonestly, in a week or two weeks from now, we\u2019re not going to look specifically to how we win certain games. Hopefully, we\u2019re going to learn and get better from how we won. The key is understanding wins in our league.\u201d\n\nBridgewater hasn\u2019t put the offense on his back. He hasn\u2019t had to, either.\n\nBut he\u2019s been fairly consistent and played mostly turnover-free football.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely getting comfortable just with all the guys,\u201d Bridgewater said. \u201cWe work extremely hard throughout the week just trying to continue to build that chemistry. \u2026 It\u2019s good to just continue to get those guys involved and they help this team win football games.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Teddy Bridgewater probably should have had another multi-touchdown day for the New Orleans Saints.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/saints_jaguars_football_22885_c0-98-2388-1491_s1200x700.jpg?5352ba04bd8145c2a6a2f3681d7a0fab596137a1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
