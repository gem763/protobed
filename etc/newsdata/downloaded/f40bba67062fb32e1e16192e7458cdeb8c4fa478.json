But since then, the team lost at home to Schalke and Lyon, drew at Bayer Leverkusen, and then allowed Wolfsburg to come back for a 1-1 draw last Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a defeat,\u201d Leipzig chairman Oliver Mintzlaff had said of the last disappointment, when he criticized the team for not living up to expectations.\n\n\u201cNot only could we have won points, but we could have boosted our self confidence. It annoys me, it was totally unnecessary,\u201d Mintzlaff said. \u201cWe have a coach, a brilliant coach. He will draw the right conclusions and speak with the team.\u201d\n\nNagelsmann made four changes to his team for the match against Zenit, dropping Marcelo Saracchi, Yussuf Poulsen, Christopher Nkunku and Diego Demme for Nordi Mukiele, Kevin Kampl, Ademola Lookman and Emil Forsberg, who was celebrating his 28th birthday. It was Lookman\u2019s first start of the season.\n\nDespite an early setback when Yaroslav Rakitskiy put the Russian visitors ahead, Leipzig managed to turn the game around with Marcel Sabitzer setting up the equalizer and then scoring a sublime goal for the win.\n\n\u201cWe stayed calm despite falling behind and were rewarded in the end,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cWe did well against the high balls from Zenit, which are not so easy to defend against. If we win in St. Petersburg in two weeks, we\u2019ll be in a very good position for the rest of the group phase.\u201d\n\nLeipzig also has ambitions of challenging for the Bundesliga title in Nagelsmann\u2019s first season in charge following his switch from Hoffenheim.\n\nThe team was boosted by the arrivals of Nkunku from Paris Saint-Germain, Czech forward Patrik Schick from Roma, Brazilian defender Luan Candido from Palmeiras, and goalkeeper Philipp Tschauner from Hannover.\n\nLookman\u2019s loan move from Everton was made permanent, while British prospects Ethan Ampadu and Emile Smith-Rowe joined on loan from Chelsea and Arsenal, respectively.\n\nPerhaps the biggest transfer coups were in convincing Forsberg and Germany forward Timo Werner to stay despite attention from other clubs.\n\nThe team had started the season well but injuries and also some bad luck have taken their toll.\n\nFortunately for Leipzig, rivals have also been struggling - Bayern Munich hasn\u2019t won either of its last two Bundesliga games - and Nagelsmann\u2019s team is just one point behind leading clubs Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Wolfsburg.\n\nLeipzig next plays at Freiburg on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After a winless month, Leipzig is back to its best.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/aptopix_germany_soccer_champions_league_62097_c0-199-3057-1982_s1200x700.jpg?ddc3828f72a7c0aefd22b929f183e2a28c640299", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
