But in one swoop, the chief of staff had given Democrats fodder and undermined weeks of administration talking points that there had been no quid pro quo on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI didn't find it the least bit credible,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffHouse Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment Kasich says he'd back impeachment The Hill's 12:30 Report: White House does damage control after Mulvaney remarks MORE (D-Calif.) said Friday when asked about Mulvaney\u2019s walk-back.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s remarks came as witness after witness appeared behind closed doors with Schiff and other lawmakers to talk about the administration\u2019s actions in Ukraine, despite a White House letter to Democrats last week that pledged an end to cooperation with the probe.\n\nMany of those testifying have served up more damaging headlines for Trump \u2014 including U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, a donor to Trump whose testimony, it was thought, might be more helpful to the White House.\n\nEven as it dealt with the impeachment circus, Trump\u2019s advisers were trying to sell skeptical Republicans on a cease-fire deal with Turkey as a win.\n\nThis only churned up fresh criticism over the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, which various Republicans and outside observers have criticized as an abandonment of Kurdish allies, a ceding of U.S. power and an act that have given new energy to ISIS.\n\nIn a rare rebuke of Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell: Trump's troop pull back in Syria a 'grave strategic mistake' Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump insists Turkey wants cease-fire | Fighting continues in Syrian town | Pentagon chief headed to Mideast | Mattis responds to criticism from Trump TSA head rules himself out for top DHS job MORE (R-Ky.) penned an op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday afternoon labeling the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria a \u201cgrave strategic mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe combination of a U.S. pullback and the escalating Turkish-Kurdish hostilities is creating a strategic nightmare for our country,\u201d McConnell wrote in the op-ed, which did not mention Trump\u2019s name. \u201cEven if the five-day cease-fire announced Thursday holds, events of the past week have set back the United States\u2019 campaign against the Islamic State and other terrorists.\u201d\n\nThere is no link between impeachment and the crisis in Syria, but it is hard not to see political connections between the two. And the Syria fight certainly does not make it easier for Republicans to defend Trump on impeachment.\n\nRep.

It was absolutely correct.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a frequent Trump critic, said he\u2019d back impeaching Trump on Friday.\n\n\u201cLook, I fought with people on air over, \u2018Is there a quid pro quo\u2019 and \u2018Does this rise to the level of impeachment.\u2019 I now believe that it does,\u201d Kasich said during an interview on CNN on Friday. \u201cAnd I say it with great sadness. This is not something I really wanted to do.\u201d\n\nWhile Republicans in the Senate are highly unlikely to support impeaching the president, some say they may be less willing to defend him as he disregards their opinions on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it directly makes it more likely that he\u2019ll be removed from office. I do think it makes his political standing significantly weaker in the Senate,\u201d said GOP strategist Alex Conant, who served as communications director for Sen.
