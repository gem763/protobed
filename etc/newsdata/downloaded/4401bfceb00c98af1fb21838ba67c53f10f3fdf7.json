After we dumped them, the Kurds have fallen into the arms of the Assad regime, while Turkey will be as hostile to the United States as ever, once Congress gets done trying to punish it for its invasion.\n\nJust like Obama\u2019s withdrawal from Iraq, Trump\u2019s pullback in Syria is a belated reaction to the Iraq war.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Nypost.Com Trump-Is-Repeating-Key-Obama-Middle-East-Mistakes"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
