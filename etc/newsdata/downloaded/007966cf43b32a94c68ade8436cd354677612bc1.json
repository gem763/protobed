In the case of the 737 MAX, that absolutely did not happen,\" said SWAPA president, Captain Jon Weaks.\n\nHe said it is \"critical\" that Boeing takes whatever time is necessary to safely return the MAX to service, but added that pilots \"should not be expected to take a significant and ever-expanding financial loss as a result of Boeing's negligence.\"\n\nSouthwest, with around 10,000 pilots represented by SWAPA, had 41 more MAX jets on order for this year alone. The budget-friendly carrier is scheduling without the MAX until at least early January, pending regulatory approval for commercial flight.\n\nPilots at American Airlines Group <AAL.O>, which so far has cancelled MAX flights through early December, have also demanded compensation for lost pay related to the 737 MAX grounding, but have not filed a lawsuit.\n\nLast month Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly promised the airline would share any reimbursement from Boeing over the MAX grounding with its employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tracy Rucinski; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Eric M.
