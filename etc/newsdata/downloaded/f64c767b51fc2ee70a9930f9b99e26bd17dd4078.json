The leak was later stopped, IRNA reported.\n\nThe state-run IRNA news agency, quoting Iran\u2019s National Iranian Tanker Co., identified the stricken vessel as the Sabiti. It turned on its tracking devices late Friday morning in the Red Sea, putting its location some 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Jiddah, according to data from MarineTraffic.com. The ship is carrying some 1 million barrels of crude oil, according to an analysis from data firm Refinitiv.\n\nImages released by Iran\u2019s Petroleum Ministry appeared to show no visible damage to the Sabiti visible from its bridge, though they did not show the ship\u2019s sides. Satellite images of the area showed no visible smoke.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s SHANA news agency said no ship nor any authority in the area responded to its distress messages.\n\nThe Sabiti last turned on its tracking devices in August near the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas. Iranian tankers routinely turn off their trackers as U.S. sanctions target the sale of Iran\u2019s crude oil.\n\n\u201cThe oil tanker ... sustained damages to the body when it was hit by missiles 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the Saudi port city of Jiddah,\u201d IRNA said.\n\nThe agency did not say whom Iranian officials suspect of launching the missiles.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi described the incident as an \u201cattack\u201d carried out by those committing \u201cdangerous adventurism.\u201d In a statement, Mousavi said the Sabiti was struck twice in the span of a half hour and an investigation was underway.\n\nLt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet overseeing the Mideast, said authorities there were \u201caware of reports of this incident,\u201d but declined to comment further.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude oil rose over 2% in trading Friday to reach some $60.40 a barrel.\n\nThe reported attack comes after the U.S. has alleged that in past months Iran attacked oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, something denied by Tehran.\n\nFriday\u2019s incident could push tensions between Iran and the U.S. even higher, more than a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions now crushing Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nThe mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone and other incidents across the wider Middle East followed Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nThe latest assault saw Saudi Arabia\u2019s vital oil industry come under a drone-and-cruise-missile attack , halving the kingdom\u2019s output. The U.S. has blamed Iran for the attack, something denied by Tehran. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, whom the kingdom is fighting in a yearslong war, claimed that assault, though analysts say the missiles used in the attack wouldn\u2019t have the range to reach the sites from Yemen.\n\nMousavi also said that Iranian tankers have been targeted by \u201cdamaging activities\u201d over recent months in the Red Sea. He did not elaborate.\n\nIn May, an Iranian oil tanker carrying more than 1 million barrels of fuel oil suffered a reported malfunction in the same area as the Sabiti came under attack. The kingdom helped the Happiness 1 reach anchorage off Jiddah, where it was repaired and later left.\n\nIn its analysis Friday, Dryad Maritime said the incident involving the Happiness 1 bore \u201cthe hallmarks of a potential explosive incident.\u201d\n\nIran said in August another oil tanker, the Helm, faced a technical failure while passing through the Red Sea, without elaborating.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/05/579c909a4ba494c2ba0579700f4e/191011-oil-tanker-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
