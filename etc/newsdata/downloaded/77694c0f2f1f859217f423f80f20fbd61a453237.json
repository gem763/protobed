Biden.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman for Texas, called out Mr. Trump on Twitter Friday after the president\u2019s re-election campaign released an attack ad characterizing Mr. Biden as corrupt.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s ad about Joe Biden is a disgrace. Every one of us needs to call this exactly what it is: propaganda. Doing anything less is playing right into his hands,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke tweeted.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign announced earlier Friday that $10 million is being spent on ads highlighting how Mr. Biden had threatened, while vice president, to withhold U.S. funding for Ukraine unless it fired its top prosecutor at the time, Viktor Shokin.\n\nMr. Shokin had been investigating a company with business ties to Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, when he was eventually dismissed in 2016, and Mr. Trump has accordingly accused the former vice president of having pressured Ukraine to protect his son.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged earlier this week that he asked newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate the Bidens. Democrats within the House of Representatives responded by accusing Mr. Trump of abusing his power as president and launching an official impeachment investigation.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged earlier this week that he asked newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate the Bidens.
