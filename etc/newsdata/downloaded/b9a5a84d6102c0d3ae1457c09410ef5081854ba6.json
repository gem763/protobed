Never leave your belongings unattended\n\nIf you are travelling with valuable items, make sure these are with you at all times, or you have taken the precautionary measure of locking them in a hotel safe.\n\nMr Etkind explained insurers won't honour a claim if items have been stolen or gone missing if they've been left unattended in public places.\n\nThese include airports or hotel rooms after you've checked out.\n\n'As long as you carry your belongings with you, or they are locked in a safe at your accommodation, you can be reimbursed by your policy for items that are lost, stolen, or damaged during your trip,' he said.\n\nHe said insurers will also deny a claim when you've left your belongings with someone who isn't travelling with you for more than 50 per cent of your trip.\n\n2. Keep all your receipts and travel details handy\n\nOne simple way to avoid travel insurance problems when making a claim is to ensure you keep all receipts for expenses, as well as itineraries and travel contacts.\n\n'The key thing is to ensure you keep a copy of anything that will verify that your lost, stolen or damaged possessions are yours,' Mr Etkind said.\n\nIf you need to make a claim, your insurer will request proof of purchase, although it is likely you will be able to provide this once you have returned home.\n\n3. Don't assume expensive items are automatically covered\n\nItems such as phones, laptops, cameras and jewellery are not automatically covered by your insurer.\n\nMr Etkind said these items are often excluded from standard or basic travel insurance policies or cover is capped at just a few hundred dollars.\n\n'However, each insurer has a maximum benefit or limit they will pay for high-value items, and some have the option of customising the sub-limit on each individual item,' he said.\n\nMr Etkind said if you are travelling with anything extremely valuable, it would be better to insure this under a separate policy.\n\nOne simple way to avoid travel insurance problems when making a claim is to ensure you keep all receipts for expenses, as well as itineraries and travel contacts (stock image)\n\nHow can you easily retrieve your IMEI number? The IMEI number can be found printed inside the battery compartment of the phone. It can also be displayed on-screen on most phones by entering *#06# on the keypad. After you've entered the number press Call or Send as if making a call. Your IMEI number will be retrieved and displayed on your screen Source: Optus.com.au\n\n4. Keep details of your mobile separate from your phone\n\nIf you lose, or have your mobile phone stolen, to make a claim you will need to be able to provide a Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number.\n\nThis is a 15 - 17 digit unique number found within settings of mobile devices, and used to identify them.\n\n'You will also need to provide proof that you have blocked this number by an Australian telecommunications provider, to be eligible for a claim,' Mr Etkind said.\n\nWhen blocked, your device is inoperable, preventing its misuse and minimising call costs to you if it is being operated by another user.\n\nDon't automatically assume you are covered for all injuries by your insurer when you are travelling\n\n5. Most self-inflicted injuries won't be covered\n\nWhile travelling, if you injure yourself or contract an illness through high-risk activities, it's possible your insurer won't cover the cost.\n\n'In general, reckless activities will not be covered by your travel insurer,' Mr Etkind said.\n\n'Likewise, if you ignore official advice by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) Smartraveller website, and suffer an incident, your claim could be invalid.'\n\nFor instance, if you were to catch a tropical disease because you did not get the recommended vaccinations, your claim for medical services may be denied.\n\n6. Read the fine print on cancellation claims\n\nYou cannot make a cancellation claim because of the illness of a close relative or friend, and your claim may also be rejected if the person knew about an existing medical condition, when you purchased your policy.\n\nHowever, if the person wasn't ill before you purchased your policy, you may be able to make a cancellation claim.\n\n'It's also important to note that some providers may not provide coverage for close relatives that aren't Australian residents, who are present in Australia at the time the illness occurs,' Mr Etkind said.\n\n7. Travel delay cover applies to flights only\n\nOne thing to be careful of when taking out standard insurance is travel delay cover.\n\nMr Etkind said standard insurance policies will only cover flight delays, not delays with other forms of transport.\n\n'The reimbursable costs in relation to flight delays will include accommodation and meals that you had to pay for, as a result of the delay,' he said.\n\nThe expert said those planning on taking a cruise should be aware there is a specific type of cover for this mode of transport.\n\n'With InsureandGo, cruise-goers can purchase a tailored cruise travel insurance policy that will cover them for any delays on their trip,' he said.", "description": "An Australian travel insurance expert has revealed how to best protect yourself on holiday.
