New ideas and technology frightens a lot of people, especially the old school types that have made their money in other investments.\n\nBitcoin Holding Steady\n\nWe are now into the fifth day since the epic market surge that briefly took BTC back to five figures again. A little has been added since yesterday but Bitcoin is still consolidating around the $9,300 level. Aside from a brief dip below $9,100 yesterday there has been no attempt to break out of this channel.\n\nSpending some time on crypto twitter you get the impression that some would actually revel in a massive collapse of digital assets. Peter Schiff is one of those characters that appear to post just to get a reaction, and he usually does. He almost changed stance on crypto last week but is back on the attack again.\n\nHis latest comments are still suggesting that the entire Bitcoin market is being manipulating by whales that are feeding off the ambitions of the hodlers.\n\n\u201cBitcoin hodlers won\u2019t sell as they believe they\u2019ll get rich when #Bitcoin moons. Bitcoin whales get rich by selling now to realize their paper gains before a market crash wipes them out. The whales must make sure the hodlers don\u2019t lose faith and cash out so that they can cash in!\u201d\n\nBitcoin hodlers won't sell as they believe they'll get rich when #Bitcoin moons. Bitcoin whales get rich by selling now to realize their paper gains before a market crash wipes them out. The whales must make sure the hodlers don't lose faith and cash out so that they can cash in! \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 29, 2019\n\nThis makes sense partially in that there has been a bit of pumping and dumping by day traders but this usually occurs during periods of consolidation. There is also the notion that this can apply to any market such as stocks or gold. Anyone with enough of the asset can cause wider market movements through manipulative tactics.\n\nHodler to Whale\n\nWhat Schiff fails to realize is that Bitcoin has \u2018mooned\u2019 a couple of times in recent years so those hodlers would have got rich if they sold at the right time. Additionally hodlers usually have more faith in the technology than day traders who are just looking for a quick buck.\n\nThis belief in Bitcoin will prompt them to buy back at lower levels which is known as accumulation. If this is repeated over time through a number of market cycles the hodlers will soon become whales themselves.\n\nCrypto analyst \u2018Rhythm Trader\u2019 pointed out that there is another ethos to holding Bitcoin and that is freedom from the current financial system which, and Schiff agrees, is totally flawed.\n\n\u201cBitcoiners don\u2019t see it as a get rich quick scheme Peter, we see it as a get free quick scheme. It\u2019s one of the only tools to escape this Orwellian future.\u201d\n\nNot sure how that fits in with the goldbug\u2019s latest rhetoric but he has been singing the same tune since BTC was in double digits.\n\nImage from Shutterstock", "description": "Sometimes you get the feeling that certain industry pundits would rejoice if Bitcoin and crypto markets crashed and everyone got wiped out.
