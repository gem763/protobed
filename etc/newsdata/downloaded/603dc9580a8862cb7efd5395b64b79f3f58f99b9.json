The post notes the exploit requires no or minimal customization to root a phone that\u2019s exposed to the bug.\n\nThe research group has listed some of the devices affected that are running Android version 8.x or later:\n\nPixel 2 with Android 9 and Android 10 preview\n\nHuawei P20\n\nXiaomi Redmi 5A\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 5\n\nXiaomi A1\n\nOppo A3\n\nMoto Z3\n\nOreo LG phones\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7, S8, S9\n\nThe bug was fixed in earlier versions \u2013 3.18, 4.4, and 4.9 \u2013 of Android kernel, but it has resurfaced again.\n\nThe attacker can\u2019t use Remote Code Execution (RCE) to exploit the vulnerability. However, if you install an application from an untrusted source, attackers can take advantage of that. Attackers can also take advantage of the bug if they pair it with vulnerabilities in the Chrome browser to render content.\n\nA statement from Android team says it has informed phone makers to issue a patch:\n\nWe have notified Android partners and the patch is available on the Android Common Kernel. Pixel 3 and 3a devices are not vulnerable while Pixel 1 and 2 devices will be receiving updates for this issue as part of the October update.\n\nThe researchers speculate the bug is being used by NSO, an Isreal-based group known to sell tools to authorities to exploit iOS and Android.\n\nIt\u2019s advisable that you don\u2019t install apps from non-trustworthy sources, and use an alternate browser such as Firefox or Brave till the issue is fixed. We\u2019ll keep you posted on any updates issued by phone makers.\n\nRead next: Coinbase reinstates GBP bank transfers, but ups fees for low-volume traders", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F01%2FV%C3%ADrus.jpg&signature=8beb66c629a1d03c42803ebfb98c455c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
