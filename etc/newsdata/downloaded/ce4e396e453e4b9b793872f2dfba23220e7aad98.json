So, he has typecast himself as an action hero, and the audiences simply love seeing him perform some high-octane stunts.\n\nIn his latest release, which starred his idol Hrithik Roshan alongside him, Tiger Shroff once again showed what he is capable of. The fact that the film has minted Rs 200 crores already proves that the audiences love him too.\n\nTwitter\n\nBut isn\u2019t Tiger Shroff doing the same thing in every movie? He also fears about being repetitive. For his next, Baaghi 3, he believes his competition isn\u2019t only with films like Mission Impossible and Avengers, but he has to also compete with himself.\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 357 SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 695 SHARES 706 SHARES 704 SHARES\n\n\u201cIt is a problem, no doubt. I don\u2019t only have to compete with Mission Impossible and The Avengers but also with myself. I am expected to raise the level of action with every film. It is a challenge but a welcome challenge,\u201d he told Bollywood Humgama in an interview.\n\nThe report further added that in Baaghi 3, the makers wanted to take Tiger Shroff\u2019s action scenes to another level. But seemingly, that has already happened in War. So, now there is a change in plan.\n\nTwitter\n\nIt was earlier said that Tiger would go to Israel to learn Krav Maga, which is a form of martial arts. But than plan has been seemingly scrapped because that could look similar to the action sequences we saw in War.\n\nBaaghi 3 is slated to hit the screens on March 6, 2020.", "description": "But isn\u2019t Tiger Shroff doing the same thing in every movie?
