Participants had an average age of just over 50, and those with health conditions such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes at the outset were not included in the analysis.\n\nIndividuals joined the study between 1992 and 2000 and were then followed up for an average of 16 years, during which time more than 41,600 deaths were recorded.\n\nWhen participants signed up they were asked a number of questions about aspects of their lifestyle such as exercise, smoking and weight as well as diet and nutrition \u2013 including their average consumption of drinks such as fizzy drinks, fruit squash and energy drinks. Fruit juice consumption was not included.\n\nThe results show 9.3% of those who drank less than one glass of soft drink a month died during the study, compared with 11.5% of those who drank two or more 250ml glasses a day.\n\nThe team say that once factors such as body mass index, diet, physical activity, smoking and education were taken into account, that translates to a 17% higher risk of death among those consuming two glasses a day compared with those drinking less than one glass a month.\n\nThe trend was seen for both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages. Similar results were seen for both men and women.\n\nSugar in fruit juice may raise risk of cancer, study finds Read more\n\nWhile sugary drinks have previously been linked to obesity, the researchers say that did not fully explain the association of high consumption with an increased risk of death.\n\nWhen the team looked at specific causes of death they found frequent consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks was associated with a higher risk of death from circulatory diseases, while sugar-sweetened soft drinks were associated with a higher risk of death from digestive disease. Soft drinks overall were also associated with a greater risk of death from Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nMurphy said it might be possible that those frequently consuming artificially sweetened drinks have a sweet tooth and might be eating more sugary snacks, but that there was no sign of such an effect in the data.\n\nDr Mathilde Touvier of Inserm, the French national institute of health and medical research, welcomed the latest study.\n\nThe results \u201cdefinitely strengthen the recommendations of public health authorities to limit artificially [sweetened] beverages \u2013 and not only sugary drinks\u201d, she said, adding that some advisers to public health bodies were questioning the scientific evidence behind a tax on sugary drinks.\n\nHowever, the latest study has a number of limitations, including that participants were only asked about their drinks and lifestyle at one point in time, and the study relies on self-reporting.\n\nAmelia Lake, a professor in public health nutrition at Teesside University, said the finding that artificially sweetened drinks were associated with an increased risk of death was interesting, not least since they were often marketed as \u201chealthier\u201d than sugary drinks.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely an area that we need to have more evidence and a clear message about,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the study reinforced the need to increase the availability of the best alternative: water. \u201cWe need to make it easy for people to choose the healthier option,\u201d said Lake.", "description": "Drink more water, say experts as they argue study proves need for curbs on consumption", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79e53155848a76530fe0e168bdd63635aaa488c0/0_148_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=76c699e604ff1a29e28c272e279e4fdb"}
