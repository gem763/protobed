The Supreme Court is set to hold a hearing on April 23 to review the government's appeal of a New York federal judge's decision in January to eliminate the question.", "description": "If addressed in census, it \"poses a significant risk of distorting\" congressional representation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/kcjMwea9HwlRHu2H8miVrp9tSGg=/0x104:3000x1791/1920x1080/2019/03/06/1551901688708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-06"}
