By even saying a supermax will be on the table, Horst ran afoul of the guidelines.\n\nESPN's Malika Andrews shared the league's official statement, which said, \"Teams cannot commit to offer a 'supermax' extension prior to the summer following a player's seventh season in the NBA.\"\n\nAntetokounmpo becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2021, and the Bucks will be allowed to officially begin negotiations next summer.\n\nEverybody expects them to pull out all the stops to keep the three-time All-Star. He averaged 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game en route to winning MVP.\n\nESPN's Bobby Marks estimated Milwaukee will be able to pay him $247 million over five years. That would be the biggest contract in NBA history, surpassing the five-year, $206 million extension Russell Westbrook signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nOf course, Antetokounmpo staying with the Bucks is far from a foregone conclusion.\n\nKyrie Irving and Kevin Durant signed with the Brooklyn Nets, turning down the chance for more money with their old teams. Anthony Davis forced his way to the Los Angeles Lakers when he made it clear he wouldn't re-sign with the New Orleans Pelicans in 2020 should he opt out of his current deal.\n\nMax and supermax extensions no longer provide much of an advantage for teams hopeful of retaining their best unrestricted free agents.\n\nAlthough they let Malcolm Brogdon go to the Indiana Pacers in a sign-and-trade, the Bucks gave a combined $258.2 million this summer to the trio of Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and George Hill.\n\nOwnership is clearly willing to spend what's necessary to remain a title contender, and that includes giving Antetokounmpo every penny it can under the NBA's salary cap.", "description": "Stating the obvious apparently costs $50,000 in the  NBA .
