Blame 40% of America", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Why are Christmas decorations put up so early? Wochit, Wochit\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2013 Frost hasn't yet settled on the pumpkins on your porch, but that hasn't stopped hordes of shoppers from getting a jump start on purchasing gifts for the winter holidays.\n\nRoughly 40% of consumers begin their holiday shopping before Halloween, according to the National Retail Federation's2019 holiday forecast. Further, a full 19% are \"early bird\" shoppers who started in September or earlier.\n\nThat's because people want to \"spread out their spending,\" says Katherine Cullen, senior director of consumer and industry insights for the federation. Cullen added that early shopping has been a consistent trend for the past 15 years or so.\n\nNot only are shoppers starting earlier, but they're spending more, too. The National Retail Federation predicts holiday retail sales during November and December will increase by about 4% over 2018 to a total of around $730 billion.\n\nSooner than you think: Why you should start saving for the holiday season now\n\nSo whether you like it or not, the holiday shopping season is upon us. Here's everything you should know ahead of the 2019 holiday shopping season:\n\nWhy do so many people shop early?\n\nThere's a couple of reasons why people choose to shop for the holidays months in advance. For starters, some customers think they are \"going to see ...deals and promotions all season long,\" so they choose to shop early for some stores and later for others, Cullen said.\n\nAnother reason people hit the stores early is to avoid the frenzy of shoppers. Holiday sales are tallied by the National Retail Federation from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 \u2013 a high-volume shopping period nationwide.\n\nFor those who choose to shop early, they may be trying to \"get away from crowds and hectic shopping environments,\" Cullen told The Courier Journal.\n\nFord recalls nearly 300,000 vehicles in the US: Here's what you need to know\n\nShould you spread out your shopping or do it all at once?\n\nChristmas and Halloween shopping side-by-side in many stores this season including At Home in Jeffersontown.

Even those who come into the season most prepared, and start shopping months in advance, might still be getting some last-minute gifts in December.\n\nBut, for Cullen, one thing is clear: stay alert.\n\n\"Being an informed shopper goes a long way,\" she said. \"It\u2019s definitely worth watching what retailers are doing throughout the season.\"\n\nMore specifically, Cullen said shoppers should pay attention to retailers' catalogs and websites for holiday sales and promotions.\n\nHow do local stores deal with earlier shoppers?\n\nTo deal with an increased volume of shoppers, retailers will hire between 530,000 and 590,000 temporary workers during the 2019 holiday season, according to a National Retail Federation estimate.\n\nAccording to Cullen, retailers have \"gotten a head start on holiday hiring\" due to the early-bird shoppers \u2013 with some choosing to keep employees they hired for the back-to-school season.\n\nSo if you're looking for seasonal holiday employment, now is the right time to start.\n\nIs your credit card spending out of control? Here's how to tell\n\nHow much will people spend this year?\n\nHoliday retail sales are expected to increase between 3.8% and 4.2% over 2018 to a total of between $727.9 billion and $730.7 billion, according to the National Retail Federation's forecast of holiday sales.\n\nMore specifically, consumers say they will spend an average of $1,047.83 this holiday season, up 4% from the $1,007.24 of 2018.\n\nCullen said he overall economic health and the absence of a government shutdown, which plagued the 2018 shopping season, will contribute to this increase in spending.\n\nDue to shutdown fears over tariffs and market volatility, holiday sales only grew 2.1% in 2018 from the year before, which was an abnormally small increase, according to the NRF. That was less than half the 5.2% growth seen during the 2017 holiday season.\n\n\u201cAll of that uncertainty can make consumers a little bit shy about spending that extra money,\" Cullen said. \"They want to make sure they have a great holiday season, but they don\u2019t want to overspend and break their budget.\u201d\n\nWhat are people spending money on this holiday season?\n\nOf the $1,048 the average person will spend during the 2019 holiday shopping season, $659 of that will be spent on gifts for family, friends or co-workers, according to the National Retail Federation report.\n\nAbout $227 will be spent on non-gift holiday items such as food and decorations and $162 will be spent on other non-gift purchases for family or self, according to the report.\n\nMen are projected to spend more at $1,152.17, while women will spend closer to $948.90 this holiday shopping season.\n\nAdditionally, the biggest spenders are shoppers age 35 to 44 at an average of $1,158.63, just narrowly ahead of the average $1,157.95 that shoppers ages 45 to 54 will spend in 2019, according to the report.\n\nAnd if you're wondering where pocketbooks are deepest, shoppers in the Northeast will spend $1,178.96 on average. Shoppers in the South will spend $1,027.80.\n\nAnalysis: Nike made a surprising choice for its next CEO. Here's why it happened\n\nWhere will people do their holiday shopping?\n\nOnline shopping comes out on top, with 56% of consumers saying they'll shop online in 2019. The National Retail Federation estimates online and other non-store sales to increase between 11% and 14% to between $162.6 billion and $166.9 billion this season.\n\nBut fear not: the era of the big-box store is not completely over. Though 56% of holiday shoppers say they will shop online, 53% say they will also shop in department stores, along with 51% at discount stores and 44% at grocery stores/supermarkets.\n\nOf online shoppers, a full 73% said they plan to use their smartphone or tablet to research or make a purchase. Roughly one-third of consumers say they'll also shop at clothing or accessory stores, and 23% say they'll shop at local/small businesses and at electronic stores.\n\n\u201cPeople are spreading out their shopping across different destinations,\" Cullen said. \"They don\u2019t necessarily distinguish between in-store and online.\"\n\nFollow Ben Tobin on Twitter @TobinBen.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/30/holiday-shopping-forecast-2019-how-much-money-people-spend/2498802001/", "description": "Santa 'claws' his way into October as 40% of shoppers start the holiday shopping season early.
