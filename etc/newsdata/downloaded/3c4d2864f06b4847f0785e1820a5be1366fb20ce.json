It says, \u201cWhoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\u201d An explanation to this section clarifies that penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.\n\nThe section uses the words, \u2018against the order of nature\u2019. Order of nature means events that are normal and expected to occur naturally if there is no artificial or manmade impediment to the same. Unnatural is something, an act or behaviour, contrary to that considered as natural. As per Section 377, only the peno-vaginal sexual intercourse is natural, all other forms of carnal intercourse such as anal or oral are unnatural. One reason could be that since only the former leads to perpetration of life, so it is logical to construe the same as \u2018in the order of nature\u2019, but can it be understood to imply that all else is perverse to nature. Going by this logic contraception and abortions should be outlawed as they both run contrary to the natural course of events. Not only euthanasia, but the entire medical science also interferes with nature. Should we stop treatments and criminalize medical research?\n\nIf we have to swear by all things natural, then we need to give up technological advancements- our computers, smartphones, usage of electricity, automobiles etc., all contributing towards destruction of nature\u2026 the list is endless. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, almost everything around us is artificial. Should we go back to the pre-historic Paleolithic period? Even the concept of a modern state is a human construct. It monopolizes State violence and grants protection to the weak thus goes against nature\u2019s principles of \u2018might is right\u2019 and \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019.\n\nNatural versus unnatural is a perennial debate. Who decides what is natural and what is not, since there are human interventions in every sphere of nature. If the majority is allowed to dictate terms and impose its choices upon the minority, wouldn\u2019t that trample our sacrosanct human rights Studies prove that the majority of early human societies were polygamous. If humans are polygamous by nature then the institution of marriage which imposes monogamy is unnatural and should be abolished. Monogamy is a choice and so are sexual preferences. Matrimony cannot ensure monogamous behaviour. Judiciary acknowledged the same last year when it decriminalized Adultery, which continues to be a ground of divorce but is no longer a crime. Similarly, Section 377 could not stop homosexual behaviour, rather caused it to be practised clandestinely with innumerable health hazards in tow. Law cannot regulate personal individual choices unless they disturb others in the exercise of their freedom, in which case reasonable restrictions can be imposed.\n\nSection 377 is an archaic relic. In September 2018, a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court decriminalized consensual homosexual sexual activity among adults (Navtej Singh Johar v.UOI). In doing so the court restored the Delhi High Court\u2019s 2009 Naz Foundation judgment which was overruled by a two-judge bench of the SC in Suresh Kumar Kaushal v. Naz Foundation (2013).\n\nThere is a misconception amongst the majority of the people that Section 377 has been repealed, but that is nowhere close to the truth. S. 377 has only been watered down and now sexual activity of whatever nature among consenting adults, is not punishable under the law. In doing so the court has introduced the element of consent as a ground for exemption from criminal prosecution under Section 377. Non-consensual sexual activity among adults; and all sexual activity irrespective of consent with minors or with animals continues to be a punishable crime. In addition to S. 377; POCSO Act, 2012 also provides blanket protection to minors against sexual offences. Dilution of S. 377 is a much-awaited and welcome move, as earlier this provision was utilized as a tool for harassing people with unconventional sexual orientation. Adults are capable of making their own choices and decisions. Law needs to be invoked only in the absence of consent. Penalising consensual sexual acts among adults amounts to a clear violation of their right to life, personal liberty and privacy. No modern State can afford to continue with such oppressive laws and India is no exception.", "description": "Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code criminalizes homo-sexuality and bestiality.
