But as the members of the cartel took to the streets, apparently freeing dozens of prisoners and turning the city into an urban war zone, Mexican authorities decided to release Ovidio Guzman.\n\nSecurity Minister Alfonso Durazo told Reuters that Guzman was released to protect lives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decision to detain and then almost immediately release one of Mexico\u2019s most wanted drug traffickers \u2014 who has also been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department \u2014 would be a shocking display of weakness for Mexico\u2019s government, revealing how entrenched the country\u2019s leading drug cartel remains, even after the arrest of El Chapo.\n\nIn a video statement, top officials from Mexico\u2019s security agencies described how agents came under attack by armed men from a house while on patrol.\n\n\u201cThe personnel fired back and took control of the house, in which they found four occupants. During that action, one of them was identified as Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez,\u201d said Durazo. \u201cThis resulted in various groups of organized crime groups who surrounded the house with a greater firepower than that of the patrol. In addition, other groups carried out violent actions against residents in various parts of the city, creating panic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDurazo did not initially confirm that Guzman was arrested or freed, offering a vaguely worded description of events that bewildered many security experts.\n\n\u201cBut Ovidio was arrested or returned to the narcos?\u201d asked analyst H\u00e9ctor de Maule\u00f3n in a tweet.\n\nWithin an hour, Reuters and several Mexican news outlets reported that Guzman had been released.\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrado did not issue any statements about the attack. But he was stopped at the airport by people who filmed him while asking questions about Sinaloa. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow,\u201d he replied.\n\nVideos circulating on social media appeared to show heavily armed civilians firing machine guns mounted in pickup trucks.\n\nAD\n\nSinaloa\u2019s public security director, Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda, told Milenio television that between 20 and 30 prisoners had escaped during the operation, although some had been recaptured.\n\nAD\n\nAnother video on social media purported to show inmates running through the streets, forcing drivers out of their cars.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re freeing them,\u201d exclaims a woman in one video. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave here.\u201d\n\nBy 9 p.m., the fighting appeared ongoing. Improvised roadblocks were constructed with vehicles set on fire. Some people sprinted through the streets holding their children to make it from one building to another to avoid gunfire.\n\nGovernment officials warned residents not to venture into certain parts of the city.\n\nAD\n\nCuliacan in northwestern Mexico is the stronghold of the Sinaloa cartel and where the organization has ample support and firepower \u2014 demonstrated Thursday across that city.\n\nThe cartel has remained the largest organized crime group in the country for nearly three decades and continues to be the most prominent cartel across major parts of the country. Its biggest rival, the New Generation cartel of Jalisco, is growing fast and has been expanding its territory across Mexico, seeking to fill the void El Chapo left.\n\nAD\n\nSince the capture of El Chapo, the Sinaloa cartel has been led primarily by Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada and El Chapo\u2019s sons Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n and Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n.\n\nAD\n\nIn February, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment against two more of El Chapo\u2019s sons, Ovidio Guzman and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, for \u201cknowingly, intentionally, and willfully\u201d distributing drugs to be exported into the United States. They would have to be extradited to the United States to face trial on those charges.\n\nDuring El Chapo\u2019s trial in New York this year, prosecutors said that the sons had played a role in facilitating their father\u2019s escape in 2015 from a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juarez, Mexico.\n\nEl Mayo has long remained an elusive figure who, unlike El Chapo, has stayed largely out of the spotlight. There have been reported tensions between the leader and the two Guzm\u00e1n sons in recent months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDrugs continue to flow into the United States unabated as the Sinaloa cartel has ramped up its production of methamphetamines and fentanyl.\n\nLopez Obrador has backed away from an aggressive military-led strategy to defeat the cartels, which many of his predecessors championed. On Thursday, Mexican officials were quick to depict the day\u2019s incident as security forces acting in self-defense, rather than a planned takedown of one of Mexico\u2019s most wanted men.\n\nAD", "description": "The battle turned the streets of a major city into what appeared to be an active war zone, leading to the arrest and release of Ovidio Guzman.", "authors": ["Kevin Sieff", "Latin America Correspondent", "Steve Fisher"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RlCV7SatvbgItcI6u0mqBuJYEik=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7CX6YDHRLEI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
