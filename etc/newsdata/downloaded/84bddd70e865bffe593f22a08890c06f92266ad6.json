This time, he\u2019s explaining why institutional players have been so reluctant to get involved in digital assets.\n\nLee: Crypto\u2019s Not Big Enough for Institutions\n\nIn a recent interview, Tom Lee explains:\n\nThere\u2019s a mechanical issue for crypto in terms of infrastructure that\u2019s needed, but there\u2019s probably also a size of market issue.\n\nHe believes that cryptocurrency might be \u201ctoo small\u201d for institutional players, who are used to investing in major stocks, precious metals and other assets that are larger or have more range to them. He states:\n\nGold is nine trillion. The stock market is 66 trillion. The bond market is 86 trillion. Bitcoin is not even half a percent of the total assets. If you\u2019re asking someone to allocate one percent to bitcoin \u2013 that\u2019s like triple the market weighting, like you\u2019re asking someone to make a massive bet even though it\u2019s one percent of their assets because bitcoin is that small. It\u2019s probably correct I think about one percent of the United States owns bitcoin and at that size, it\u2019s too small for an institution. It\u2019s a hobby.\n\nAnother problem? Lack of regulation. While this is an age-old argument, it\u2019s still one that applies in that laws are relatively scarce when it comes to monitoring and regulating the crypto market. As it stands, Lee says that there\u2019s nothing getting in the way of the U.S. just initiating a full ban on crypto activity, a step recently taken by countries like China.\n\nHe comments:\n\nThere\u2019s not enough legal and regulatory protection for bitcoin in the U.S. to prevent a White House executive order banning bitcoin, like nothing today would prevent bitcoin from being outlawed in the U.S.\n\nAs it stands, he doesn\u2019t believe institutional players are confident enough to take part in a market that doesn\u2019t have federal backing.\n\nAt the same time, while Lee brings up some interesting and harsh points, they do somewhat go against other reports or evidence that suggests a growing institutional presence in the crypto space. For example, in London, OTC firm known as the BCB Group has recently submitted a new report suggesting that institutional interest in crypto within the U.K. has expanded greatly over time despite the mess of last week\u2019s crypto bloodbath.\n\nEvidence Proving Otherwise?\n\nOverall, BCB Group suggests that it has well over $100 million in assets being traded each week, and that it\u2019s not out of the question to see \u201ctens of millions of pounds\u201d traded in a single day.\n\nFurthermore, several Wall Street and institutional firms are getting more involved in crypto and blockchain. One such company is Morningstar, a credit ratings agency that is now looking to offer a wide range of \u201ccustom crypto services\u201d to its customers.", "description": "Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame is once again in the news, this time talking about why institutional players don't get involved in crypto.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/06/cnbc-tom-lee.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
