It was the most Fed dissents in three years.\n\nThe divisions on the policy committee underscored the challenges confronting Chairman Jerome Powell in guiding the Fed at time of high uncertainty in the U.S. economy.\n\nStock prices fell after the Fed issued its policy statement, reflecting investor disappointment that the central bank had declined to indicate that more rate cuts were likely this year. The Fed did leave the door open to additional rate cuts \u2014 if, as Powell suggested at a news conference, the economy weakens.\n\nFor now, the economic expansion appears durable in its 11th year of growth, with a still-solid job market and steady consumer spending. But the Fed is trying to combat threats including uncertainties caused by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, slower global growth and a slump in American manufacturing. The Fed noted in its statement that business investment and exports have weakened.\n\nAt his news conference, Powell acknowledged that Fed officials are sharply divided about the wisest course to take on interest rates.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of difficult judgments and disparate perspectives,\u201d the chairman said. \u201cI really do think that is nothing but healthy.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s modest rate cut Wednesday irritated Trump, who has attacked the central bank and insisted that it slash rates more aggressively. The president immediately signaled his discontent:\n\n\u201cJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\u201d\n\nUpdated economic and interest rate forecasts issued Wednesday by the Fed show that only seven of 17 officials foresee at least one additional rate cut this year. And at least two Fed officials expect a rate hike next year.\n\nNone of the policymakers foresee rates falling below 1.5% in 2020 \u2014 a sign that the turbulence from a global slowdown and Trump\u2019s escalation of the trade war is viewed as manageable.\n\nThe median forecasts show the economy is expected to grow a modest 2.2% this year, 2% next year and 1.9% in 2021. Those forecasts are well below the Trump administration\u2019s projection that the president\u2019s policies will accelerate growth to 3% annually or better. But they also suggest that policymakers do not envision a recession.\n\nUnemployment is projected to be 3.7% and inflation 1.5%, below the Fed\u2019s target level of 2%\n\nA resumption of trade talks between the Trump administration and Beijing and a less antagonistic tone between the two sides have supported the view that additional rate cuts might not be necessary. So has a belief that oil prices will remain elevated, that inflation might finally be reaching the Fed\u2019s target level and that there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy remains sturdy.\n\nThe job market looks solid, wages are rising, consumers are still spending and even such sluggish sectors as manufacturing and construction have shown signs of rebounding.\n\nYet no one, perhaps not even the Fed, is sure of how interest rate policy will unfold in coming months. Too many uncertainties exist, notably the outcome of Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nTrump has meantime kept up a stream of public attacks on the central bank\u2019s policymaking, including referring to Powell as an \u201cenemy\u201d and the Fed\u2019s policymakers as \u201cboneheads.\u201d Even though the economy looks resilient, the president has insisted that the Fed slash its benchmark rate more deeply - even to below zero, as the European Central Bank has done \u2014 part to weaken the U.S. dollar and make American exports more competitive.\n\nPowell has said that the policymakers remain focused on sustaining the expansion and keeping prices stable without regard to any outside pressures.\n\nThe Fed is monitoring the global slowdown, especially in Europe, and Britain\u2019s effort to leave the European Union. A disruptive Brexit could destabilize not just Europe but the U.S. economy, too\n\nU.S. inflation, which has long been dormant, has begun to show signs that it is reaching the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target and might remain there. If the Fed\u2019s policymakers conclude that inflation will sustain a faster pace, it might give them pause about cutting rates much further.\n\nThe most serious threat to the expansion is widely seen as Trump\u2019s trade war. The increased import taxes he has imposed on goods from China and Europe \u2014 and the counter-tariffs other nations have applied to U.S. exports \u2014 have hurt many American companies and paralyzed their plans for investment and expansion.\n\nIn recent days, the Trump administration and Beijing have acted to de-escalate tensions before a new round of trade talks planned for October in Washington. Yet most analysts foresee no significant agreement emerging this fall in the conflict, which is fundamentally over Beijing\u2019s aggressive drive to supplant America\u2019s technological dominance.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A sharply divided Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate Wednesday for a second time this year but declined to signal that further rate cuts are likely this year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/federal_reserve_25570_c0-0-3079-1795_s1770x1032.jpg?28568899722d4896573f3c25028468edea21ab76", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
