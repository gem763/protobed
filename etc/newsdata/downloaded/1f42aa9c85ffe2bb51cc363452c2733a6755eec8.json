Handre Pollard cut the deficit to four points with a drop goal but penalties from Richie Mo'unga and Beauden Barrett consigned South Africa to their first defeat of 2019.\n\nThe All Blacks, who have an 11-day break before their next game against Canada, should go on to top Pool B and hope for an easier quarter-final as a result. South Africa next face Namibia in Toyota City.\n\nThe Springboks had the physicality to match New Zealand but not the precision, with too many missed tackles, at times aimless kicking and poor hands under the high ball gifting away territory.\n\nAfter a long-range penalty from Pollard opened the score, he missed a simple opportunity to add another when he struck the post.\n\nNew Zealand rallied and produced the sucker-punch that knocked the stuffing out of the Boks as the world champions showed clinical finishing with two tries in just a few minutes.", "description": "Four minutes of first-half brilliance led an otherwise unconvincing New Zealand to a 23-13 victory over South Africa in a clash between two World Cup favourites on Saturday that never quite lived up to its billing.", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/17/39/74/1000x563_cmsv2_6bedeb99-7d38-57d0-9b81-7493a775b69a-4173974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
