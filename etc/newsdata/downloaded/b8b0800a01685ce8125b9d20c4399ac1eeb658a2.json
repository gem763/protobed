The film stars Robert Redford as an older man who can\u2019t stop robbing banks (and being incredibly charming while doing it).\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely little movie, and watching it, I continually felt stunned that it was made in 2018. It has a warmth, low stakes, and casual pacing that make it feel like a film from an older era, when special effects were harder to do and budgets where much lower as a rule. (It also has a relatively brief hour-and-a-half runtime.)\n\nI wish I could pinpoint exactly what it is that gives the film its throwback feel, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s any one thing. But watching the movie certainly made me wish there was more like it coming out \u2014 movies with not-too-enormous budgets that are content to tell a simple genre story and leave.\n\nCheck out nine trailers from this week below.\n\nOnward\n\nPixar put out the first full trailer for Onward this week, and you know what, it looks more fun than I expected. It\u2019s a road-trip movie \u2014 just one that\u2019s set in a fantasy universe \u2014 about saving a lost father with a big ticking clock of tension hovering over everything (now that I type it out... that is nearly a description of Coco, too). It comes out March 6th next year.\n\nJungle Cruise\n\nCan a Disney theme park ride with as dry a name as \u201cJungle Cruise\u201d be turned into as successful a series as Pirates of the Caribbean? Jungle Cruise\u2019s source of inspiration may be a little ridiculous, but it looks like it\u2019ll be a fun adventure film. It comes out next year on July 24th.\n\nThe Walking Dead spinoff\n\nI kind of watch in horror as The Walking Dead universe continues to endlessly expand into AMC\u2019s entire programming slate, but I have to say, the addition of a YA spinoff seems like one of the smarter moves. The show doesn\u2019t have a proper name yet, but it\u2019s supposed to start next spring.\n\nCharlie\u2019s Angels\n\nThere\u2019s a new trailer out for Elizabeth Banks\u2019 take on Charlie\u2019s Angels, which looks like a very modern and funny take on the classic series. It comes out November 15th.\n\nTruth Be Told\n\nOctavia Spencer plays a true-crime podcaster in Truth Be Told, which has her character questioning whether her podcast led to someone being wrongly convicted. There\u2019s been more and more crossover between podcasts and TV series lately, and this premise offers a lot to explore. The show starts December 6th.\n\nThe Elephant Queen\n\nAs the launch of Apple TV Plus closes in, Apple continues to push out trailers for its first shows. The Elephant Queen isn\u2019t exactly prestige TV, but it looks like the exact kind of heartwarming and adorable fare that Apple is likely to go heavy on. The show premieres November 1st.\n\nJudy & Punch\n\nMia Wasikowska stars as a puppeteer seeking revenge in this wonderfully odd and unexpected feature debut from writer and actor Mirrah Foulkes. It comes to the UK on November 21st.\n\nWeathering With You\n\nI failed to include trailers for Your Name when it came to the US a couple years back because I thought it looked kind of cheesy and too deep of a genre cut, but I should have included it given how enormous of a hit the film was and how much bigger it\u2019s become since. So here\u2019s the trailer for the next film from Your Name\u2019s director and producer, which is also Japan\u2019s submission to the 2020 Oscars. It comes out January 17th.\n\nEarthquake Bird\n\nNetflix has a strange thriller coming up that has Alicia Vikander and Riley Keough in the leading roles. It\u2019s sort of just about normal love triangle drama... but also there\u2019s nonstop creepy music and potentially some questionable use of culture shock. Also someone accuses another person of being \u201caddicted\u201d to cameras? They say it in a sexy whisper? I\u2019m kind of lost. It comes out November 1st.", "description": "Watch this week\u2019s best new trailers from Netflix, Disney, Apple TV Plus, Pixar, and more, including the first trailer for Jungle Cruise starring The Rock.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gM0EjvYYOXUrjpSVq7Lf3oUIdDo=/333x0:2621x1198/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19280341/junglecruise.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
