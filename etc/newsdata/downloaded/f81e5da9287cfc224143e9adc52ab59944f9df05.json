Opulent, expensive, untouchable.\n\nAnd mostly secretive. For all the rest of us know, life on board these vessels could be an endless stream of wild parties peopled with Bond villains, supermodels, soccer players and movie stars.\n\nNot quite, says Spanish businessman Joaqu\u00edn Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n, the proud owner of superyacht Buka, a gleaming 36.8-meter vessel that spends most of its time sailing the sunnier waters of southern Europe.\n\nIn a rare interview, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n gave CNN Travel the rundown of what it's actually like to own one of these lavish leviathans, why he's willing to spend his millions keeping it afloat, what he uses it for -- and whether his friends are jealous.\n\n\"We feel like it's our second house,\" Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n, told CNN Travel via phone from his yacht, parked somewhere in the Mediterranean.\n\nNeed for speed\n\nBuka goes at a speed of up to 31 knots. Courtesy Heesen Yachts\n\nBuka, built in 2006 by Dutch luxury ship manufacturer Heesen , has a top speed of 31 knots (about 36 mph), four generously proportioned cabins and is valued at an estimated $10 million.\n\nIncredibly, by today's superyacht standards, that's pretty modest.\n\nAt the 2019 Monaco Yacht Show , where Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n will be rubbing shoulders with fellow superyacht owners later this month, Buka will be dwarfed by oceangoing titans such as the six-deck, 106-meter Amadea, which comes complete with a helipad on the prow.\n\nFor the Spaniard, owning a custom-built superyacht was all about continuing a passion passed down by his late father, who bequeathed him a wooden motor yacht -- also called Buka -- that he'd bought in the 1970s.\n\nSpanish businessman Joaqu\u00edn Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n, the owner of superyacht Buka. Courtesy Heesen Yachts\n\nBitten by the fancy boat bug, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n upgraded in 2000 to his first superyacht, a 32-meter vessel built by Heesen that, in keeping with family tradition, he again called Buka.\n\nWhen it came to the third and current incarnation of Buka, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n drew upon his engineering background to contribute to the design process. His wife -- whose name he says he'd prefer to keep private -- gave input on the interior design.\n\n\"Building the boat -- obviously with the yard -- was one of the nicest periods of our life,\" he recalls.\n\nThe couple is based in Barcelona, in Spain . Their proximity to the water was, says Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n, an influence on Buka's streamlined, open design. \"We were always close to the seas,\" he says.\n\nBut as a self-confessed adrenaline junkie who also races cars and motorcycles, his principal concern was how fast the vessel could go. \"Speed was, for us, a main priority,\" says Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n. \"But also, we wanted a boat [that] can cruise at low speed.\"\n\nBuka was created with a semi-displacement hull, which allows the boat to rise up in the water, decreasing drag and increasing potential speed to more than 30 knots, faster than the standard cruising pace of about 20 knots.\n\n\"But for example, today, we left the marina and we were doing 12-13 knots at very low rest,\" he adds. \"So it's quite versatile.\"\n\nRelated content This floating entertainment hub could be biggest superyacht in the world\n\nHome away from home\n\nThe interior of the yacht was designed by Omega. Courtesy Heesen Yachts\n\nThe yacht's interior, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n says, is \"personal.\" His wife collaborated with Dutch yacht design company Omega to create something to match the family's taste.\n\nIts four cabins, he says, typically never accommodate more than six guests. The couple has two sons and two young grandchildren, so \"it's a perfect size,\" he adds.\n\nThe family lives on the yacht, in some combination, from early May to the beginning of October.\n\nTheir favorite hangout? The Balearic Islands, not too far from the yacht's base in Barcelona.\n\nBut if you're imagining a summer of beach clubs and cava, think again.\n\nThe family are more into sports than partying.

On the contrary, we go to bed early, wake up very early, gym, swimming, bicycling, running.\"\n\nBuka doesn't have the crazy-cool features that some of the giant superyachts have, insists Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n. No helicopter pads or submerged underwater lounges.\n\nSo, would he consider getting a bigger yacht?\n\n\"Well, I mean, if our business continues to do well, yes, it might be possible that we go for something -- not much larger, because otherwise, you are restricted on marinas, you are restricted on some anchorage places, so it's a balance,\" he says.\n\n\"If in the future we go for a new project, it would be probably, I don't know, four meters more, but no more than that.\"\n\nRelated content Confessions of a VIP private jet flight attendant\n\nSwanky lifestyle\n\nThe superyacht is based in Barcelona. Courtesy Heesen Yachts\n\nWhile some superyachts and their owners often find themselves the focus of tabloid photographers, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n says the kind of lifestyle he and his family lead doesn't lend itself to attention.\n\n\"If you are in Ibiza, with all the paparazzi going around and all these famous Russian millionaires and so on, you might have this approach, but we try to keep a very low profile,\" he says.\n\nDuring the winter months, Buka is based in the Royal Yacht Club of Barcelona, where the family occasionally take her out, weather depending.\n\n\"When we have some winter, sunny, nice days, we go out with the boat towards Tarragona or towards the south,\" he says.\n\nFolch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n is also a judge in the annual World Superyacht Awards.

Courtesy Heesen Yachts\n\nAs a Superyacht Award judge, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n is expected to stay up to date with the latest trends in ship building, such as the emergence of \"eco\" superyachts like the Black Pearl, a distinctive vessel powered by huge black sails and diesel-electric hybrid system.\n\nFolch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n says there's definitely been a move towards more fuel-efficient yachts and he's taking note.\n\n\"If we decide to build a new one, it will be, for sure, on these parameters,\" he says.\n\nOne thing the superyacht owner knows for certain? He still harbors a dream of sailing to the small spot in the Pacific where his family's yachting journey began.\n\nBuka is named for an island in Papua New Guinea, where, Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n says, back in the '60s his mother and father got temporarily stranded when their boat was caught in a storm.\n\nThe couple were put up by locals and always remembered the experience fondly.", "description": "Spanish businessman Joaqu\u00edn Folch-Rusi\u00f1ol Corach\u00e1n, owner of the Buka, tells CNN Travel about life on board his vessel.
