They are a lot more than that. It's not me being offended by the whole mascot thing. It's not. It's about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we're perceived in that way, or used as mascots.\"\n\nIn response to these remarks, the chant was discouraged and foam tomahawks were not placed in every seat like usual on October 9th.\n\nA Step Forward\n\nThe Braves released a statement about the situation ahead of the game expressing their alleged desire to evolve their brand.\n\n\"Out of respect for the concerns expressed by Mr. Helsley, we will take several efforts to reduce the Tomahawk Chop during our in-ballpark presentation today. Among other things, these steps include not distributing foam tomahawks to each seat and not playing the accompanying music or using Chop-related graphics when Mr. Helsley is in the game.\n\nAs stated earlier, we will continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the overall in-game experience. We look forward to a continued dialogue with those in the Native American community after the postseason concludes.\"\n\nHelsley was told about the decision ahead of the game and expressed his gratitude to ESPN.", "description": "Braves fans should probably rethink this tradition.", "authors": ["Lynne Versluys"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yLvFwHl8bsZznd6DD7WL4g--~B/aD0yMjQyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/3fd92edeacffff684fd089e6a6e329f4", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
