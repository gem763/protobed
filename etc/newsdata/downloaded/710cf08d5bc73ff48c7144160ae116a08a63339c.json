It would be catastrophic.\"\n\nBut Tory MP Caroline Johnson said it was a \"political bill\" that postpones no deal - rather than ruling it out - and made it \"virtually impossible\" for the prime minister to negotiate with the EU.\n\nWhat does the no-deal bill say?\n\nThe bill says the prime minister will have until 19 October to either pass a deal in Parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOnce this deadline has passed, he will have to request an extension to the UK's departure date to 31 January 2020 - and, unusually, the bill actually includes the wording of the letter he would have to write.\n\nIf the EU responds by proposing a different date, the PM will have two days to accept that proposal. During that time, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date.\n\nThe bill also requires ministers to report to the House of Commons over the next few months. potentially providing more opportunities to take control of the timetable.\n\nBe aware though, this could all change over the next few days because MPs and peers have the power to pass amendments to any law.\n\nMr Johnson had said he would use the Fixed Term Parliaments Act to call for an early general election on 15 October - before the EU summit and the proposed law's imposed deadline - if the bill got through the second vote on Wednesday night.\n\nThe prime minister said the MPs' bill would \"hand control\" of Brexit negotiations to the EU, and he had no choice but to press ahead with efforts to call an October election, adding: \"The people of this country will have to choose.\"\n\nHowever the prime minister's motion calling for an early election failed to gain enough support from MPs to pass.\n\nUnder the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a prime minister must have the backing of at least two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs before a poll can be called outside of the fixed five-year terms.\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the issue with the negotiations was that Mr Johnson's government had not come forward with any alternatives for the backstop to guarantee an open border.\n\n\"This is a problem that's real, that's complex and needs a solution,\" he said.\n\nThe government lost its majority on Tuesday when one of its MPs - Dr Phillip Lee - quit the Conservatives to join the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIt dropped further after No 10's decision to remove the party whip from the 21 Tory MPs who voted in favour of taking over Parliament.\n\nOne of those booted out of the party, Margot James, has publicly questioned the role played by Dominic Cummings, the PM's senior aide, in the decision.\n\nRaising the issue at PMQs, she urged Mr Johnson to bear in mind his predecessor Margaret Thatcher's famous adage that \"advisers advise and ministers decide\".", "description": "The bill passes the House of Commons by 327 votes to 299 votes and it now heads to the House of Lords.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mgcx8.jpg"}
