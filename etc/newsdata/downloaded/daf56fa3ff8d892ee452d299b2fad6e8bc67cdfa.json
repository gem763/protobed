The U.N. health agency said there is no established link between the Zambia case and the ongoing Congo outbreak but said increased surveillance and vaccination efforts are needed, warning that \"there is a potential for international spread.\"\n\nIn rare cases, the live virus in oral polio vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks.\n\nNine African countries are currently battling polio epidemics linked to the vaccine as WHO and partners struggle to keep their efforts to eradicate polio on track. Elsewhere, cases have been reported in China, Myanmar and the Philippines.\n\nOn Thursday, WHO and partners are expected to announce they have rid the world of type 3 polio virus.\n\nThere are three types of polio viruses. Type 2 was eliminated years ago. That now leaves only type 1. But that refers only to polio viruses in the wild. Type 2 viruses continue to cause problems since they are still contained in the oral polio vaccine and occasionally evolve into new strains responsible for some vaccine-derived outbreaks.\n\nThe global effort to eradicate polio was launched in 1988 and originally aimed to wipe out the potentially fatal disease by 2000. While cases have dropped dramatically, the virus remains stubbornly entrenched in parts of Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. This year there have been 72 cases of polio in Pakistan after only eight in 2018.\n\nIn meeting notes from an expert polio oversight board in September, WHO's Michel Zaffran said the status of eradication was \"of great concern,\" noting the Taliban's ban on house-to-house vaccination in Afghanistan. Officials described the program in Pakistan as a \"failing trajectory.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
