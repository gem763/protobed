What started as the country\u2019s definitive restaurant guide 22 years ago has evolved into a brand covering all aspects of food, operating on multiple media platforms. 01 Oct 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nFood, art, fashion and fun are set to collide on Sunday, 17 November 2019 at GrandWest in Cape Town, as the date and venue have been set for the 2019 Eat Out Mercedes-Benz Restaurant Awards. Following the exciting changes in the Top 10 line-up last year, it\u2019s the event every South African foodie is anticipating with bated breath.\n\nIn 2018, The Restaurant at Waterkloof walked away with the Restaurant of the Year title, moving up two places from number three in 2017, and disrupting The Test Kitchen\u2019s six-consecutive-year reign as the number one restaurant (since 2012). Chef Gregory Czarnecki, known for his famous bonbons, managed to sneak a hug from his wife before being tackled by his overjoyed team members, who accompanied him onto the stage to receive the award.\n\nThe shake-up means that anticipation is higher than ever before to see who, of all the country\u2019s culinary geniuses and fantastic restaurants, will receive the top honours of being announced the 2019 Eat Out Restaurant of the Year and the Eat Out S.Pellegrino & Acqua Panna Chef of the Year.\n\n\u201cThe South African culinary scene grows from strength to strength every year,\u201d says Chief Judge Margot Janse. \u201cThis awards ceremony is the ideal platform to acknowledge and celebrate our extraordinary chefs and all they have accomplished in the industry.\u201d Janse, who is highly respected by chefs in the industry, has been involved with the Eat Out Mercedes-Benz Restaurant Awards since 2018. Aside from Janse, all judges will remain anonymous, as done in previous years and in line with international restaurant assessments.\n\nIn addition to naming the hotly contested Top 10 restaurants, the 2019 Eat Out Mercedes-Benz Restaurant Awards will recognise the Eat Out S.Pellegrino & Acqua Panna Chef of the Year, the Eat Out Retail Capital New Restaurant of the Year and the Eat Out Nederburg Rising Star. Winners will also be announced for the Eat Out Graham Beck Chefs\u2019 Chef Award, the Eat Out Service Excellence Award, the Eat Out Wine Service Award, the Eat Out John Psillos Award for Outstanding Contribution to Service, the Eat Out Lannice Snyman Lifetime Achievement Award, the Eat Out Woolworths Sustainability Award, the Eat Out Nespresso Innovation Award and the Eat Out Style Award.\n\nThe limited tickets are in high demand, having sold out rapidly in previous years. For this year\u2019s event, the theme is A Grand Garden Party, which will reflect in the event\u2019s sustainable focus. Guests will be welcomed with canap\u00e9s and Graham Beck MCC, after which they will be seated in the Grand Arena for a multiple-course lunch created by some of the country\u2019s top chefs to be enjoyed throughout the ceremony.\n\nTickets are now available for the 2019 Eat Out Mercedes-Benz Restaurant awards for R1 795 per person Howler: www.howler.co.za", "description": "SA\u2019s best guide to SA\u2019s best food, Eat Out is one of South Africa\u2019s most loved and respected food brands.
