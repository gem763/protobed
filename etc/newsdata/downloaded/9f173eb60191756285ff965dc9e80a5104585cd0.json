Their timing is off; their unison is breaking. Rather than releasing a majestic unified blizzard of eggs and sperm at precise moments, they now spawn in pathetic, erratic drizzles across weeks and months. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look promising for those species,\u201d Shlesinger says.\n\n\u201cThis study is heartbreaking,\u201d says Shayle Matsuda of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve all worried might be true.\u201d\n\nRead: There is no escape for corals\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the case that the probability of fertilization goes way down if they don\u2019t spawn at the same time, and really at the same time,\u201d says Nancy Knowlton, a coral researcher at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. There\u2019s a huge evolutionary pressure for them to be synchronized, \u201cso to not be synchronized is a really big thing.\u201d\n\nShlesinger first realized something was wrong when he and Loya tried to rear some well-known coral species in large outdoor aquariums. To their surprise, some didn\u2019t spawn at the expected times\u2014an abnormality that Shlesinger initially blamed on his setup. \u201cIt took me two or three years to realize that things are completely off,\u201d he says.\n\nAcross 225 nights spread over four years, Shlesinger snorkeled through the Gulf of Eilat for hours, recording the number of spawning corals. Several species, he realized, had abandoned their regular year-on-year patterns. It\u2019s not that they had shifted to a different time window. One of them spawned at a full moon in 2015, but at a new moon in 2016. Two others spawned in fits, on almost every night over several months. \u201cThey were completely unsynchronized,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery night, I just saw a few individuals spawn, and they released just a few drops of material. It\u2019s meant to blast into the ocean, but I just saw dribbles.\u201d\n\nOn land, climate change has repeatedly screwed with nature\u2019s schedules, making once-synchronized species out of step with each other. In parts of Alaska, brown bears are abandoning their usual feasts of salmon. Songbirds are struggling to feed their chicks as hatching periods become uncoupled from gluts of insects. Earlier snowmelts mean that snowshoe hares are becoming dangerously conspicuous as their still-white fur contrasts against exposed earth. Shlesinger\u2019s work \u201csupports the idea that natural patterns in the ocean are changing in similar ways to what we\u2019ve observed on land,\u201d says Erika Woolsey of the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.\n\nThe worst bit about this is that no one really knows why it\u2019s happening. Light pollution from nearby cities could throw the corals off, as could plastics, pesticides, or human-made pollutants that resemble hormones. Then again, Shlesinger found that corals in isolated nature reserves had become just as desynchronized as those growing near urban areas. Whatever\u2019s making them misfire is widespread in its reach, and rising temperatures seem like a likely culprit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we hear about this phenomenon elsewhere in the next few years,\u201d Shlesinger says. (Woolsey adds that scientists might be able to use crowdsourced data from dive-tour operators, Facebook groups, and apps like iNaturalist to check on coral-spawning patterns around the world.)", "description": "Certain species of coral release their eggs and sperm with perfect synchronization.
