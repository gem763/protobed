It was that bad. It was horrible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was like, \u201cThis is uncomfortable for me, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s awkward for her (casting director), no one\u2019s going to enjoy this experience.\u201d\u2018\n\nThe star then joked that she should have stopped the audition there and then, and asked to be called back later \u2013 for a different role!\n\nElizabeth isn\u2019t the only person who missed out on appearing in the fantasy epic, as Mark Strong also could have been cast.\n\nMark Strong also could have been in the fantasy saga (Picture: Rex)\n\nThe 56-year-old spoke to Metro.co.uk about potentially being in the saga \u2013 but was too coy to reveal which character he was offered.\n\nHe told us: \u2018I was offered a role in it but I can\u2019t ever say who it was.\n\n\u2018Because I don\u2019t want to belittle the person who eventually did it because they may have no idea they weren\u2019t first choice.\u2019\n\nAsked if he turned the role down, Mark added: \u2018No it came my way and we were flirting a while with it, but I didn\u2019t have to turn it down.\u2019\n\nGame of Thrones seasons one to eight are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
