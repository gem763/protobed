She was so happy about her pregnancy, but she developed a life-threatening infection in her second trimester. It didn\u2019t respond to antibiotics and rapidly spread through her body. It was impossible to save both her and her pregnancy, and I perfor med h er abortion in the hospital.\n\n\u201cYou saved my life that night!\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou are my God Sent Angel.\u201d In the E.R., she had asked her grandmother whether God would punish her if she ended her pregnancy. Her grandmother, through tears, reassured her that God would understand. And now Kendra writes that perhaps we were brought together by God. I reach for tissues, humbled by the knowledge that sometimes abortion is lifesaving, even as many understand it to be life-ending.\n\nIt\u2019s 10:30 and the first patients are ready to see me now. I see each person twice \u2014 first to meet her, review her medical history, revisit her decision to end the pregnancy, and review and confirm that she has completed the state\u2019s required 24-hour waiting period and consent process.\n\nLater in the day I see them for the abortion procedure. For those who request medication abortion, I provide a mifepristone pill that stops the pregnancy from continuing. Then I give them a bottle of misoprostol to take home.\n\nMy youngest patient of the day is 14 and here with her parents. The oldest patient is 41, here with her husband. As on all days, my patients come from every walk of life. Most have children already; many have arranged their appointment so that they\u2019ll be done in time to pick them up after school. They assure me, again, that they are certain about their decision.\n\nBy the end of the day, I\u2019ve seen 17 people, and made sure each received the care and time she needed. After counseling, two others left without having an abortion. One decided to continue her pregnancy and become a parent. Another appeared to need more time to think about it, and I encouraged her to do that. I support all of my patients\u2019 decisions and needs; doing so is core to my work.\n\nThis was a typical day, and on the way home some of it plays back in my mind. A mother of three crosses herself and then takes the mifepristone pill she requested. Another requests a copy of the ultrasound picture for her memory box. After the abortion procedure, one asks to se e what had been in her uterus and is relieved that the fetus is less than an inch, so much smaller than she had imagined.", "description": "A thank you, a prayer for my soul, a 14-year-old and a 41-year-old.", "authors": ["Lisa H.
