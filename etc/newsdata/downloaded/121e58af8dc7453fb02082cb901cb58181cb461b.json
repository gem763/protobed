It\u2019s not second hand, but it\u2019s not new either. \u201cDeadstock is \u2018new\u2019 old stock from another era,\u201d as Bella puts it. \u201cIt\u2019s like when it\u2019s brand new, from another decade. Whenever I unearth some deadstock I freak out!\u201d\n\nBella isn\u2019t the only high profile fan of deadstock. When they\u2019re not making music with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, British band The 1975 are now giving used and deadstock T-shirts a make-over, instead of creating new tour merchandise.\n\nAre there problems with vintage clothing?\n\nIt\u2019s not all good news. The Textile Recycling Association estimates that only about 30% of the clothes we donate to charity get sold in the UK. The rest are exported to other countries, which some say is having a negative impact on their garment industries by putting local makers out of business.\n\nHowever, buying vintage means you\u2019re not using up more resources and creating more pollution to make something new, so most would argue that the positives outweigh the negatives!", "description": "Plus find out the difference between vintage, thrift and deadstock", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07q4d1b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
