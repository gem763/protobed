Just a few weeks ago, for example, Tesla demonstrated its next-gen AEB system which can more ably apply the brakes when a pedestrian or cyclist is detected.\n\nWith that said, we recently stumbled across a new video which shows a Tesla Model 3 abruptly hit the brakes when a police officer on a motorcycle runs a red light and turns left into oncoming traffic. The officer was presumably chasing someone but his sirens were off at the time.\n\nMore from BGR\n\nAs you can see in the video below, the Model 3 owner begins to accelerate at a green light and doesn\u2019t see the police officer swooping in from the right-hand side. Luckily, the Model 3 detected the officer and swiftly applied the brakes.\n\nDescribing the incident, the Model 3 owner posted the following on his YouTube channel.\n\nHappened this morning; I was rolling about my way when the light turns green, and out of nowhere a cop without their audio on for their sirens runs a red light. If not for Tesla\u2019s emergency stop safety features this would not have been a good day. Thank you #Tesla and #ElonMusk for making the #Model3 the safest car ever or I might\u2019ve scarred myself for life with a horrible accident.\n\nAnother angle of the incident can be seen below.\n\nOf course, this is hardly the first time we\u2019ve seen a Tesla take evasive action and avoid a potentially serious collision. In the video below, a Tesla that was rear ended quickly swerves to the left to avoid the car directly ahead.\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "description": "Tesla's automated emergency braking (AEB) system, which was first introduced in 2017, has improved markedly in a relatively short amount of time.
