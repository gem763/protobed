The four-day expo won\u2019t be open to the public until Sunday. Let\u2019s have a look inside.\n\nNeither Nintendo nor Microsoft attends the show. Traditionally, Sony has dominated, but this year, Sega (and Atlus), Konami, and Square Enix all have booths of roughly equal size \u2014 or even, a smidge larger.\n\nInterestingly, while Cyberpunk 2077 isn\u2019t playable, it does have an enormous booth, with people lining up to watch a promotional clip.\n\nDeath Stranding is not playable, either, but while its presence is large, it doesn\u2019t have the massive floor space that Cyberpunk 2077 does. No other single game does in the entire show.\n\nAs expected, the Square Enix booth is dominated by Final Fantasy VII Remake. Lines are long already on the press day. Expect them to be even longer \u2014 and the booth to be even more crowded \u2014 on the public ones.", "description": "Thursday was the first press day for this year\u2019s Tokyo Game Show.
