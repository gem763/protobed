With a tadpole taking the place of a pocket monster, Craig learns a Pok\u00e9mon-inspired lesson about the benefits of evolving as a person.\n\nCraig of the Creek centres on a trio of young friends growing up in a magical throwback neighbourhood where children go out and play instead of sitting inside fiddling with screens.\n\nThe woods and waterways surrounding Craig\u2019s neighbourhood are home to a vast society of children whose imaginations cast them as adventurers, explorers, inventors, and defenders of their domain.\n\nNine-year-old Craig is a cartographer, mapping his magical land with his constant companions Kelsey, a red-headed eight-year-old who fancies herself a warrior, and J.P., a tall, bumbling, 10-year-old with a Southern accent and a kind heart.\n\nThe show reminds me of my own childhood, roaming or biking through the woods surrounding my suburban Atlanta street, going on tiny adventures that seemed so much larger back in the day. My friends and I were a little older and some of our adventures involved beer or pot, but the vibe is the same.\n\nIt\u2019s a show adults can appreciate, as demonstrated by Kotaku contributor Ben Bertoli\u2019s article on one of the show\u2019s earlier video game-themed episodes and subsequent interview with its creators.\n\n\u201cThe Evolution of Craig\u201d, which aired on August 25 never directly mentions Pok\u00e9mon. Craig and his grandfather, fresh from a visit to the library to pick up a book for the boy\u2019s fifth-grade summer reading assignment, stumble upon a tadpole stranded in a puddle. With a predatory bird lurking dangerously close, Craig\u2019s grandfather urges him to take the baby home to protect it as it grows.\n\nIn response, Craig hurls a plastic capsule from a vending machine at the puddle, disappointed when it doesn\u2019t work \u201clike in that show.\u201d Craig ends up collecting the tadpole by more conventional means, taking it home and placing it in an aquarium.\n\nThe tadpole is a welcome distraction for Craig. With the summer coming to an end and fifth grade looming, the imaginative youngster is worried about his future. His fifth-grade summer reading assignment is an adult book. Soon he\u2019ll have adult responsibilities.\n\nInstead of going on adventures, he\u2019ll have to do adult things like driving around for no reason. Will his friends still be his friends? Will the creek still be his haven? Unfortunately for Craig, his distraction doesn\u2019t last long. His tadpole friend, as tadpoles do, is slowly transforming into an adult frog.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon parallels in this episode are plentiful. The evolution cards are brilliant. The chiptune musical cues are wonderfully subtle. Commercial breaks feature hilarious \u201cWho\u2019s That Creek Kid?\u201d segments featuring incidental characters no one remembers.\n\nAt one point, worrying that he\u2019s turning into his stodgy older brother Bernard, Craig imagines himself evolving like a Pok\u00e9mon and getting into a turn-based battle with his friends when they don\u2019t recognise his older, more mature self.\n\nThe tadpole inevitably becomes a frog. Craig tries to hide the now-adult amphibian from his grandfather but gets caught. The frog doesn\u2019t want to leave. Craig wants to play with his friends. He\u2019s not ready to go to fifth grade and evolve into Bernard.\n\nGrandpa sets his grandson straight. \u201cI know change is scary, but just because you\u2019re growing up doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to stop being you,\u201d the old man explains. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be Craig. You\u2019ll just know more and be able to do more.\u201d\n\nChange is indeed scary. I first discovered Craig of the Creek in the hospital last year following a harrowing health issue. I turned on Cartoon Network figuring it would bring me closer to my children, who were too young to come see me in the intensive care unit. Watching Craig of the Creek I imagined them outside playing in the woods, but I also saw myself. Newly-paralysed from the chest down, I was struggling with my own scary change. The show helped. I only wish \u201cThe Evolution of Craig\u201d had aired a bit sooner.\n\nThe episode ends with an exciting battle between the evolved tadpole and his nemesis, and Craig one step closer to being the very best Craig he can be, like no one ever was.", "description": "In \u201cThe Evolution of Craig\u201d episode of Cartoon Network\u2019s refreshingly pure animated series Craig of the Creek, our young hero struggles with the idea of growing up and the fear of transforming into a different, older person.
