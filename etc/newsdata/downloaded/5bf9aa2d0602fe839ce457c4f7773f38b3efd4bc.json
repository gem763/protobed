But it\u2019s too early to tell, but we definitely have seen that with millennials.\u201d\n\nKlein said research found that the average millennial consumed about 24 drinks a month in 2013, but in 2019 that\u2019s gone up to 29 drinks a month.\n\nHe added that Gen Z \u2014 those 21 to 24 \u2014 are drinking at a lower rate, but favoring higher quality brands. \u201cI think what we have is people saying that they\u2019re drinking less or drinking better,\u201d he said.\n\nConstellation shares STZ, -2.50% are up 27% year to date, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +1.30% 19% gain.", "description": "Your kids really do drive you to drink.", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ799_badmom_ZG_20190905204631.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
