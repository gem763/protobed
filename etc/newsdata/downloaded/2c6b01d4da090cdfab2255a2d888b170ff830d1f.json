Rockwell plunges deeper into the first mode, with the producer Jack Antonoff forgoing the \u201980s synth shimmer he\u2019s known for. Del Rey\u2019s lyrics\u2014always a serial-killer-note collage of quotations\u2014reference Baby Boomer rock and So Cal hip-hop. But musically, Rockwell more so channels patient, spaced-out troubadours across generations\u2014Simon and Garfunkel, Mazzy Star, Built to Spill\u2014with a hint of anthemic pop. Against smearing guitar, piano, and horns, Del Rey sings with recital-ready stateliness, even though her melodies are quavering and fragile. She\u2019s confronting something, and it\u2019s scaring her.\n\nThat something can include bad boyfriends. Rockwell\u2019s opening title track fires off against a \u201cman-child,\u201d \u201cknow-it-all\u201d poet\u2014\u201cYou talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s very funny: Steal the lines for your next fight. But for Del Rey, comedy and irony rarely have their usual effects of keeping emotion at a distance. At one point, it sounds like someone has fainted on the piano, which creates a clamor not unlike an ohm. Her voice turns the word blue into swirling birdsong, calling back to Joni Mitchell both lyrically and sonically. She can\u2019t quit the man-child. What does that make her?\n\nDel Rey\u2019s great theme continues to be unwise love, the romantic vision that American rock has sold for decades now but that she is perhaps coming to understand as toxic on more than just a personal level. She still yearns for the \u201clime green\u201d highs of booze and drugs, and still she yearns for the Norman Rockwell ideal of \u201cone dream, one life, one lover.\u201d In the past, she synthesized those two impulses with a creepy vision of daddy/girlie gender relations and a creepier romanticization of death. Now she\u2019s chasing dignity rather than doom. The benediction-like \u201cMariners Apartment Complex\u201d asks for room to air \u201cthe darkness, the deepness.\u201d But it also issues this statement of strength: \u201cI ain\u2019t no candle in the wind.\u201d\n\nIndeed, though Del Rey still sounds very sad, her narrators\u2014it\u2019s best to assume that she\u2019s not always her \u201cI\u201ds\u2014are growing steelier as they prop up men who are lost and sapped in all-too-current ways. After the waltzing \u201cHow to Disappear\u201d moves from verses about dysfunctional working-class hunks to one about having cats and a kid, the final coda\u2014\u201cI whisper in your ear / I\u2019m always going to be right here / no one\u2019s going anywhere\u201d\u2014represents a cry-worthy happy ending\u2014not only because she\u2019s found peace, but also because she can provide it for someone else. \u201cBartender\u201d imagines a debutante who buys a new car for anonymity\u2019s sake and steals away with a guy her peers would sneer at. The stunning \u201cCalifornia\u201d\u2014Del Rey and Antonoff train all their power on a glorious, heaving melody\u2014reaches out to an ex who\u2019s spiraling. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to be stronger than you really are,\u201d she sings, a genuinely tender offering.", "description": "Heavy and beautiful, the singer\u2019s new album, Norman Fucking Rockwell, tells of women holding on in desperate times.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/Screen_Shot_2019_08_30_at_10.35.15_AM/facebook.png?1567190348"}
