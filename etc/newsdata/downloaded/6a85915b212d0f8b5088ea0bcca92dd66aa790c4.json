The stock was then worth more than $37 billion.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates (left) once again became the world's richest man on Thursday, overtaking Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (right)\n\nAmazon's stock price dropped sharply in after-hours trading on Thursday, bringing Bezos' net worth down with it\n\nBefore the divorce, Bezos' net worth reached a peak of $150billion in 2018.\n\nSoftware pioneer Gates spent 24 years atop the list of world\u2019s richest people, but he was overtaken by Bezos last year.\n\nBezos, who owns 57.6 million shares of Amazon, lost nearly $7billion overnight last night as a result of the drop in company stock price, which analysts say was caused by Amazon's push for faster delivery.\n\nThe online retailer said its third-quarter net income fell 26 per cent from a year ago, missing Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie Bezos, pictured here in February 2017, finalized their divorce at $38 billion\n\nIts sales outlook for the holiday shopping season also disappointed analysts.\n\nAmazon is moving to cut its delivery time in half to one day instead of two.\n\nTo do that, it's adding more workers in its warehouses and expanding its shipping network with more trucks, jets and package sorting facilities.\n\nThe effort is costing the company about $1.5billion, nearly double what it previously said it would cost.\n\nBut Amazon said the one-day shipping is attracting more customers and gets shoppers to spend more.\n\n'It's a big investment,' Bezos said in a statement.\n\n'And it's the right long-term decision for customers.'\n\nThe Seattle-based company reported net income of $2.1billion in the three months ending on September 30, down from $2.9billion a year ago.\n\nEarnings per share came to $4.23. That's 36 cents less than what analysts expected, according to FactSet.\n\nThe company, which used to report razor-thin profits, has seen its quarterly profits grow in the past two years as it expanded into fast-growing businesses, such as cloud computing and advertising.\n\nSales at its cloud computing business, which powers video-streaming service Netflix and other companies, rose 35% from a year ago.\n\nAnd revenue in its 'other' category, which the company said is mostly made up of its advertising business, jumped 44 per cent.\n\nBut as Amazon grows it faces increasing scrutiny from regulators.\n\nThe Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation of major tech companies and whether their platforms have hurt competition and stifled innovation.\n\nBezos said on Thursday that Amazon's drop in net income is due to its decision to expand its workforce and fleet of delivery trucks in order to cut delivery time for Prime customers from two days to one day. An Amazon truck is seen above at a fulfillment center in Phoenix\n\nThe department didn't name any companies, but it said online retailers were an area of 'widespread concern.'\n\nAnd the European Union is investigating how Amazon uses data from the small businesses that sell goods on its site.\n\nOn Thursday during a call with reporters, Amazon executives declined to answer any questions about regulation.\n\n'I have nothing to report on that,' said Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky.\n\nRevenue for the quarter beat expectations, rising 24 per cent to $70billion.\n\nThe third quarter included Amazon's made-up sales holiday 'Prime Day,' which has become one of the company's biggest shopping events of the year.\n\nAmazon also saw a jump in headcount.\n\nIt had 750,000 worldwide employees at the end of September, up nearly 100,000 from the previous three months.\n\nBesides adding workers in its warehouses to pack and ship boxes, the company said it's been hiring more software engineers and salespeople for its cloud business.\n\nAmazon is the second-biggest U.S.-based private employer, just behind rival Walmart.\n\nFor the current quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, Amazon expects revenue between $80billion and $86.5billion.\n\nThat's below the $87.4billion analysts expected.\n\nThe personal life of Jeff Bezos was thrust into the spotlight with the announcement in January that he and his wife were divorcing after 25 years of marriage and the revelation by the National Enquirer that he had been having an affair with a former news anchor, Lauren Sanchez.\n\nJeff and MacKenzie Bezos married in 1993 and have four children. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in their Seattle garage in 1994 and turned it into a colossus that dominates online retail.", "description": "After reporting less-than-expected third quarter earnings, Amazon's stock nosedived by 7 per cent in after-the-bell trading, dragging down Jeff Bezos' net worth to $103.9billion.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20183252-0-image-a-6_1572013980460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
