(Chris Kleponis/Pool/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nMedia columnist\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d NBC News moderator Chuck Todd was insistent.\n\nHe had asked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) a simple question, and he was determined to get an answer: Why did Johnson tell the Wall Street Journal that he \u201cwinced\u201d when he learned that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was linked to that country investigating former vice president Joe Biden?\n\nWhen Johnson instead launched into an obfuscating attack on the news media \u2014 and floated President Trump\u2019s fact-averse talking points about Biden \u2014 Todd pushed back hard.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why a Fox News conspiracy . . . is popping up on here,\u201d Todd said as he tried again \u2014 and again \u2014 to get an answer from the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nThe result was a contentious shoutfest that went on for several minutes.\n\nAnd though it didn\u2019t make for enjoyable television or helpful civil discourse, it was the right thing for Todd to do.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more of this \u2014 and, pretty clearly, Trump and his communications team don\u2019t like it.\n\nIn fact, they apparently don\u2019t like it so much that the White House did not send its usual representatives out to the Sunday shows this past weekend.\n\nSure, the administration may have offered policy adviser Stephen Miller \u2014 a proven troll \u2014 but was turned down. But it did not offer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, nor acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. (Trump\u2019s lawyer and frequent attack dog Rudolph W. Giuliani did make a typically unhinged appearance on Howard Kurtz\u2019s media show on Fox News.)\n\nWhat you did see, instead, on many of the Sunday shows, were Trump\u2019s TV ads, where his false \u201cBiden is corrupt and so is the news media\u201d message could go unchallenged.\n\nEven more extreme are the Trump video ads that are appearing on Twitter, where anything goes given the platform\u2019s lax standards.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here is a notable change in Trump\u2019s long-running war against the news media. Here\u2019s how New York University professor and press critic Jay Rosen told me he sees the \u201csignal\u201d coming from the White House:\n\n\u201cThe signal is one of uncertainty: We don\u2019t know where this is going. We don\u2019t know that our normal tactics will work. We aren\u2019t confident that \u2018partisan witch hunt\u2019 still works the way it did. And we\u2019re not sure what the show hosts will do if we try to gaslight them.\u201d\n\nTodd, for one, didn\u2019t allow any gaslighting. (I asked him about this in a phone conversation Monday morning, but he declined to be quoted on the specifics: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for us to become the story.\u201d)\n\nFrank Sesno, director of the George Washington University media school, told me Todd had no choice:\n\n\u201cJohnson came to the interview to change the subject, attack the media, undermine the basic premise and the reality itself surrounding the president\u2019s call to Ukraine to investigate his political foe,\u201d he said.\n\nSesno, a former anchor and Washington bureau chief at CNN, added, \u201cAs a former Sunday talk show host, I can tell you that about the only thing you can do if a guest comes on determined to grab the mic and filibuster is to grab the mic back and insist that the question, not the distraction, is what matters.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Todd did \u2014 and we\u2019re happily seeing much more of that in recent weeks.\n\nReuters reporter Jeff Mason, too, did an admirable job last week of pushing for an answer to a Ukraine question \u2014 in his case, directly from Trump at his news conference with the president of Finland.\n\nThe questioning, which was polite but insistent, didn\u2019t turn out well for Trump, who came off looking like a movie thug as he rudely responded to Mason, \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d\n\nThese exchanges are ugly.\n\nAs the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry escalates, and as more whistleblowers come forward, they aren\u2019t about to get better.\n\nIn some cases, TV interview shows need to rethink the idea of live interviews with Trump surrogates. Arguably, they are no longer serving the public interest.\n\nAnd in all cases \u2014 print and TV interviewers, including those on cable news \u2014 need to cut through the obfuscation at every opportunity.\n\nBy ending the daily press briefing \u2014 it\u2019s now been well over 200 days since the last one \u2014 the Trump White House has shown clearly that it\u2019s not interested in being responsive to questions asked on behalf of the public.\n\nThe near-withdrawal from the Sunday programs is another step in that direction.\n\nTrump likes his message to go out raw: unfiltered and unquestioned.\n\nThe voting public, though, knows the difference between journalism and advertising. Or at least, let\u2019s hope they do.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan", "description": "Under siege, the president wants his message put out raw and unfiltered \u2014 not subject to media questioning.", "authors": ["Margaret Sullivan", "Media Columnist", "October At Am", "Margaret Sullivan Is The Washington Post S Media Columnist.
