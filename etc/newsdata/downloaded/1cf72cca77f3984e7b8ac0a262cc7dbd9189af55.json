This remains a priority for us, as the number of child pedestrians killed in road accidents have risen from 22 in 2017 to 28 in 2018.'\n\nThe new data showed that the total number of child casualties \u2013 including car passengers \u2013 fell by 9% to 14,266, the lowest year on record\n\nThe report also said that the rising number of people aged 60 and over could explain why more elderly people were killed or injured on Britain's roads.\n\nIt added: 'This relatively rapidly growing population may partly explain the upturn in fatalities and killed or seriously injured casualties seen for this age group in the last few years.'\n\nThe RAC said the new data made 'disappointing reading' and that there had been 'no meaningful reduction in fatalities' nationally for seven years in a row.\n\nIts head of policy Nicholas Lyes said: 'Of particular concern are the rises in fatalities among older age groups and a spike in fatalities on motorways \u2013 some worrying trends are emerging here that require immediate investigation, to understand the reasons for these increases and what can be done to reduce them.\n\n'In addition, the Government's data suggests an increase in motorway collisions where at least one driver has been under the influence of illegal drugs.'\n\nThe statistics showed that motorway fatalities had risen by 8% to 107 in 2018, while the number of reported accidents on motorways where a driver had been impaired by illicit or medicinal drugs rose by nearly 50% from 39 in 2017 to 57 in 2018.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: 'Any death on our roads is one too many and as these statistics show, there is still work to be done.\n\n'We are progressing more than 70 different measures to help improve safety at pace, for everyone from infants in car seats to those with years of driving experience.\n\n'I have also asked the department to urgently look at technological interventions to help reduce the number of young drivers killed, and I look forward to progress on this work in the coming months.'", "description": "Road safety groups said they have 'serious concerns'  about a rise in the reported number of child pedestrians and older motorists dying on Britain's roads following the release of the latest casualty stats.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
