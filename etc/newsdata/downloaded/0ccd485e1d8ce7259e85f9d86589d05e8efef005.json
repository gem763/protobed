The location shown in the tweet is not yet on Tesla's online database of Superchargers.\n\nOn Tuesday, a heavily modified Tesla Model S completed a lap of the circuit almost 20 seconds faster than Porsche's new electric Taycan, the automotive magazine Road and Track reported. The faster track time comes after Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk poked fun at Porsche on Twitter for calling the Porsche Taycan a Turbo, which stoked the perceived rivalry between the two automakers.\n\nPorsche's Taycan, while a competitor with Tesla's vehicles when it comes to specs, is far from being comparably priced. The cheaper Taycan Turbo starts at $153,510, while the Turbo S clocks in at a whopping $187,610. Tesla's cheapest option, the Model 3, meanwhile, starts at $38,990. Currently, a fully loaded Model S can top out at nearly $115,000. A Model X with all the options can climb to nearly $130,000.\n\nRead more: Porsche's $153,510 electric sports car, the Taycan, is set to compete with Tesla's Model S \u2014 here's how they stack up\n\nTesla will also have a slight advantage when it comes to overall speeds, topping out at 163 mph in the Model S, compared to Porsche's top speeds of 161 mph for both vehicles. Tesla's range \u2014 estimated at 345 to 370 miles by the US Environmental Protection Agency, is also likely to top Porsche, which says the Taycan Turbo S will have a range of up to 256 miles, while the Taycan Turbo will have a range of up to 280 miles.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Porsche's Taycan, while a competitor with Tesla's vehicles when it comes to specs, is far from being comparably priced.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d82a1c92e22af0d2e43e84f-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
