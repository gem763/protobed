This One Is Different. They're Good.", "language": "en", "text": "The creativity of Mario Maker creators knows no bounds. However, that vast majority of levels that go viral include the most ridiculous and difficult stages imaginable, stuff that makes for good streaming content but isn\u2019t the type of thing the average person will enjoy. Maybe what the world needed was a different kind of troll. Maybe we needed MegaTefyt.\n\nMegaTefyt is one of the most popular designers in Super Mario Maker 2 right now, and after playing around with his \u201cGet a Life\u201d series, it\u2019s not hard to see why. \u201cGet a Life\u201d is both a taunt and a description. In almost every \u201cGet a Life\u201d stage, players can only win if they, at one point, find an extra life mushroom. That seems easy enough, right? Bounce on enough enemies, grab enough coins, find one hidden in a block. You, should, in theory, have plenty of options here.\n\nThe problem is\u2014well, it\u2019s easier if you just watch:\n\nThis happens every few seconds. Bait, switch. It\u2019s Lucy and the football. A green mushroom appears in reach, only for the game to snatch it away, destroy it, or otherwise find some way for the player to avoid accomplishing their this one goal. It\u2019s hilarious because it\u2019s frustrating.\n\nThis goes on and on. There are even moments where the game drops in a frickin\u2019 laugh track after a particularly biting moment, a way for the game to rub its power in your face.\n\nI was straight up cackling at this part:\n\nMost troll-y levels mine humor from unearned surprise. There\u2019s nothing clever about an invisible block in the pathway of an otherwise regular jump, nothing interesting about making the player execute pixel-perfect jumps through a bed of spikes. As someone who routinely plays such levels on stream, taking pride in beating monstrosities engineered to grind you into pulp, I also understand being mad about how they overshadow what else is out there.\n\nMario Maker works because everyone playing it comes in with shared knowledge. We\u2019ve been playing these games for years, if not decades. Nintendo has trained us. Part of the reason level creation tools made post-Mario Maker haven\u2019t taken off, despite some being legitimately better and more robust toolsets, is because players lack that institutional knowledge. Troll stages exploit this built-in trust, but traditionally, it\u2019s at the expense of the player. What MegaTefyt\u2019s found is a different approach, one where the designer is a magician, someone playing tricks on you, but you\u2019re part of the joke, not the butt of it.\n\nThere\u2019s room for all kinds of creators, including, it turns out, a newer, kinder kind of troll.\n\n\u201cGet a Life! 3D\u201d can be played with the level code 8KR-JSB-FYG. And if you like it, you\u2019re in luck; MegaTefyt has a whole series of other \u201cGet a Life\u201d stages that riff on the same concept.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter.
