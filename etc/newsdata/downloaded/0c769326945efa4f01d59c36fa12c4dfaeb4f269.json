The moves incensed Pakistan, which considers itself the defender of Kashmiri Muslims.\n\nAD\n\nIndia accuses Pakistan of stoking a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir by sending fighters and arms across the Line of Control. Pakistan denies the accusations.\n\nAD\n\nFive civilians and one soldier were killed on Pakistan\u2019s side of the Line of Control, a spokesman for the Pakistani army said Sunday. Two Indian soldiers and one civilian were also killed, a spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said.\n\nIndia and Pakistan claimed to have killed larger numbers of the other country\u2019s soldiers in the incident, but such assertions could not be verified independently.\n\nIndian media outlets cited unnamed defense sources saying that Pakistani forces fired to provide cover for militants attempting to cross into Indian-controlled territory. Pakistan rejected such accusations and said India\u2019s firing was \u201cunprovoked.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nExchanges of fire across the Line of Control have increased in recent years, an ongoing confrontation that some analysts have called a \u201cwar by other means.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe two countries reached a cease-fire agreement in 2003, and for several years, relative calm prevailed on the frontier in Kashmir. Since 2014, however, cease-fire violations have jumped.\n\nLast year was the worst year in 15 years for such cross-border firings, according to data from the independent Indo-Pak Conflict Monitor. Each side reported 2,000 or more incidents.\n\nAD", "description": "It was one of the deadliest confrontations at the Line of Control this year.", "authors": ["Joanna Slater", "Foreign Correspondent Covering South Asia"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PgfwLS8HkXC_TRb_oWGFXHTMd5c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZKB4LXTIMI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
