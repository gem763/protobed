That\u2019s why I was so disappointed to see him resort to a cheap stunt during last week\u2019s debate.\n\nI assumed that having earned his way into the first debate where all the candidates would share the same stage at the same time, Yang would seize this moment to explain the core issue that has propelled his candidacy.\n\nIn case you missed it (and you wouldn\u2019t have seen it during the debate!), Yang\u2019s fundamental message is that a lot of working-class Americans have been left behind, and the culprit is automation. This problem, Yang insists, is going to get much more pervasive. Like the Industrial Revolution, it will lead to tremendous dislocation and disruption.\n\nTo manage this inevitable transformation, Yang proposes a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 a month, an amount specifically chosen to be big enough to mitigate the harm without being so big as to disincentivize work. Indeed, Yang argues that his \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d could actually liberate us to pursue our inventions, passions, and dreams. The brilliance here is that Yang frames what might otherwise be seen as a radical progressive idea in language that sounds good to conservative ears.\n\nDemocrats, Beware of Andrew Yang\u2019s Insane Vision for America\n\nBut instead of telling this (admittedly longer) story, Yang chose to turn his opening debate statement into a raffle where 10 families will win a \u201cfreedom dividend\u201d of $1,000 a month for a year.\n\nBy turning his big idea into a sort of game, Yang doesn\u2019t just skip over the seriousness of a looming automation dystopia\u2014he actually trivializes it. What is more, the idea of giving away money based on luck or need (it\u2019s not actually clear how winners will be determined) actually steps on Yang\u2019s own messaging. That\u2019s because Yang carefully avoids framing UBI as a giveaway (indeed, to qualify for the check, you\u2019d have to opt out of welfare payments). Instead, he sells it as something you\u2019ve earned\u2014like Social Security\u2014by virtue of being a \u201ccitizen of the richest, most advanced country in the world.\u201d\n\nSo why would an obviously smart entrepreneur squander the best chance he might ever have to make his substantive argument to a large TV audience? According to Politico, the idea helped Yang \u201craise $1 million in the 72 hours since the debate and collect more than 450,000 email addresses from people who entered the online raffle\u2026\u201d\n\nOnce you view the idea through the prism of list acquisition, rather than traditional message delivery, you begin to see the method to the madness.\n\nThis, of course, raises legal questions. FEC experts seem to see this as problematic and dubious, though there is a general sense that nothing will be done to stop it. We live in a world where a foreign government providing opposition research to a candidate doesn\u2019t necessarily qualify as \u201ca thing of value,\u201d and where using campaign funds to ostensibly pay voters can be seen as mere campaign advertising.\n\nIt also raises a practical question: Where does this end?\n\nIn recent years, we have seen the proliferation of cloying candidates begging us to \u201cvisit my website\u201d or to text such-and-such message to such-and-such number. As far as I can tell, though, this is the first time audiences have been invited to participate by virtue of being given the chance to win cash.\n\nAnd since it has apparently worked, I\u2019m worried that everyone else will get in on the act. That means we can expect to see more elites exploiting their positions of influence and undermining their credibility\u2014all in the service of shameless self-promotion.\n\nI, for one, have had enough of that.\n\nWant to win a copy of my latest eBook?
