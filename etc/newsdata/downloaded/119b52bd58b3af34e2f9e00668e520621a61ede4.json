'Cause they all have one thing in common: the same filter.\n\nA Miley fan account noticed that Miley's been filtering pics with her significant others the exact same way\u2014starting with photos from her wedding with Liam Hemsworth. But she also used this black-and-white treatment on an old picture from Kaitlyn Carter's birthday celebrations and a recent picture of Cody Simpson.\n\nBut honestly the best part about this discovery? That Miley Cyrus hopped into the comments of this person's post, writing \"classic.\"\n\nHey man, we all have our favorite filters so there's nothing to read into here! But if you're looking for an update on Miley's love life, she and Cody Simpson seem pretty obsessed with each other. At least that's the vibe I'm getting from their non-stop PDA sessions, and the fact that Cody seems to have written a love poem about Miley. Plus, Cody said THIS to People:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy. We are very, very happy. She\u2019s creative. She\u2019s very passionate about what she does, and I\u2019m very similar in that sense. That\u2019s why we get along so well. We just have a ball, yeah, and that\u2019s the most important part of a relationship, you know? The reason why it hasn\u2019t been a really crazy sudden thing is just because we\u2019ve been friends for so long....[We] found each other again in a space where we\u2019re both not partying, working real hard, and it just keeps things healthy and it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "And yup, she responded.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iXVNoEab2grzIxSSWYY4tg--~B/aD02NDA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/ea91bf5be5abee5c6f57de36362241bd", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
