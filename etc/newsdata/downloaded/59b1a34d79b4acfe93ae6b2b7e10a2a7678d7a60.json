Hmm...tie, or no tie?...\"\n\nAfter leaving This Morning, Richard and Judy had their own show - Richard and Judy - which ran until 2009.\n\nRichard and Judy were always fan favourites on the show, especially for their often scathing humour at each other's expense.\n\nAhead of their their return, Richard gushed of the show: \"This Morning holds a very special place in our hearts, so we couldn't be more delighted to take the helm once again.\"\n\nThe pair made a brief return to the show in August this year when they were joined on the sofa by Love island runners-up Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague.\n\nDuring the show, former Saturday Rochelle Humes joked that Richard and Judy could fill in for her.", "description": "Richard and his wife Judy are returning to hosting duties on This Morning for the first time since 2001", "authors": ["Will Twigger"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20720524.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_MAIN-Richard-and-Judy-to-return-to-This-Morning.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
