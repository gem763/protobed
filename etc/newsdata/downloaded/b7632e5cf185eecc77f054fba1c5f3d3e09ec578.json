In one image, Stokes appeared to have put his left hand on the side of his wife\u2019s face.\n\nClare Stokes swiftly defended her husband in a Twitter post, which included a photo of her \u201csquishing up\u201d the cricketer\u2019s face as a sign of affection as well as one of them together at the awards night. She claimed a \u201cpap\u201d was trying to twist it into a \u201ccrazy story\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable what nonsense these people will make up!\u201d she said on Twitter. \u201cMe and Ben messing about squishing up each other\u2019s faces cos that\u2019s how we show affection and some pap tries to twist it in to a crazy story! And all before we then have a romantic McDonalds 20 mins later!\u201d Stokes retweeted the post.\n\nStokes later gave a statement to the Daily Mirror in which he labelled the allegations \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d and paid tribute to the \u201cwonderful relationship\u201d he and his wife enjoy.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have become used to people making stuff up about me, but of all the topics not to mess with domestic abuse has to be at the top of the list ... For it to be toyed with for cheap headlines in this way just damages the cause of those who are abused.\n\n\u201cClare is a strong, independent woman who can speak for herself. We have a wonderful relationship and I never tire of saying how lucky I am to be with her. We both had a great night at the PCA Awards, ending with us dining out at McDonald\u2019s together.\n\n\u201cTo falsify and spread these kind of allegations so willingly is totally irresponsible. The way that this has come across is so far removed from what it was.\n\n\u201cIt was a stressful 45 minutes for us when we found out, but we wanted to address it as quickly as we could.\u201d\n\nThe awards were organised by the PCA in association with the England & Wales Cricket Board.\n\nStokes lifted the Reg Hayter Cup as the NatWest PCA Players\u2019 Player of the Year. Afterwards he said: \u201cYou can take a lot of personal pride when you receive this award because it\u2019s your peers that vote for you. Earning this award is a huge moment and something I am very gracious of.\u201d\n\nAfter the awards ceremony Stokes and his wife, a primary school teacher, visited a McDonald\u2019s on the way back to their hotel in south-west London.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive, Tom Harrison, said: \u201cWe have spoken with both Clare and Ben \u2013 as well as others in attendance \u2013 who have all clarified the innocent context behind the still photographs taken at last week\u2019s PCA awards.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhilst it is not the case here, we recognise that for the millions who are impacted by domestic violence, this is a very real and serious issue.\u201d\n\nStokes is the favourite to be named BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\n\nThe cricketer was arrested in Bristol in the early hours of 25 September 2017 after a night out with England teammates to celebrate victory over the West Indies in an international match earlier in the day.\n\nDuring a trial at Bristol crown court, the incident was described as \u201ca sustained episode of significant violence\u201d from Stokes, who had \u201clost control\u201d.\n\nStokes told the jury he had \u201cstepped in\u201d to defend two gay men who were being verbally abused, but then had to defend himself from two men, who were threatening violence. He was found not guilty of affray.\n\nLast month Stokes described a front-page article in the Sun newspaper about a family tragedy 31 years ago as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Stokes said the paper\u2019s decision to publish the story would have \u201cgrave and lifelong consequences\u201d for his mother in particular.\n\nThe article described events in New Zealand 31 years ago, before he was born, when his mother\u2019s ex-husband killed their two children before taking his own life.\n\nIn his statement, Stokes said his own public profile was not an excuse to \u201cinvade\u201d the rights and privacy of his family members.", "description": "Clare Stokes says images that seemed to show couple fighting were \u2018twisted\u2019 by paparazzi", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/PA-37944062.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcccc4537a182c2e5e8a2033effb2494", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
