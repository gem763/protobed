Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday in Afghanistan that U.S. troops will stay in eastern Turkey to protect Kurdish-held oil fields for at least the coming weeks and that he was discussing options to keep them there. (ANHA via AP)\n\nBEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The crowd hurled potatoes that thudded on the sides of the hulking U.S. armored vehicles. \"What happened to Americans?\" one man shouted in English up at the sole U.S. soldier visible on the back of a vehicle. The soldier stared silently straight ahead, away from the show of fury.\n\nIt was yet another indignity in a U.S. withdrawal that has been carried out over the past two weeks with more haste and violence than expected \u2014 and which may now be partially reversed.\n\nThe turmoil was only in part because President Donald Trump's Oct. 13 order to leave was so abrupt. It also seemed there had been little U.S. preparation for how to deal with a subsequent invasion by Turkey, though Ankara had been threatening it for months. And when it did strike, Turkey hit more widely across northeastern Syria than anticipated and was startlingly aggressive, seemingly trying to shove U.S. soldiers out of its way. Turkish artillery fire and Turkish-backed fighters came dangerously close to three American positions, U.S. and Kurdish officials said.\n\nOn Monday, a U.S. convoy was passing down an avenue in the Kurdish-dominated city of Qamishli, apparently on the way out of Syria, when it caught the brunt of residents' anger and frustration at the American military that was once their closest ally and was now abandoning them.\n\n\"Like rats, America is running away,\" one man shouted in Arabic at the vehicles, shown in a video put out by the Kurdish news agency.\n\nOne armored vehicle, its American flag flying on the back, reversed down the street and popped onto the sidewalk, apparently searching for a way around the angry men stomping toward it, jabbing their fingers in the air and shouting insults.\n\nThe withdrawal, Trump says, aims to get American troops out of the Mideast and \"endless wars,\" but decisionmakers have stumbled repeatedly over how much really to pull out.\n\nSome U.S. forces are still in eastern Syria, helping Kurdish fighters protect oil fields. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday he was discussing keeping them there. He also said the withdrawing troops will deploy in neighboring Iraq to fight the Islamic State group. But on Tuesday, Iraq's military said the troops did not have permission to stay in Iraq.\n\nTrump surprised even his own military on the ground when he agreed to remove U.S. soldiers working with Kurdish-led forces near the border in an Oct. 6 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Three days later, Turkey launched its offensive with heavy bombardment along the frontier.\n\nFor the American troops, it had not been clear how far the Turkish offensive would go, but they were promised they were out of harm's way. The assault was expected to target a block of territory in the center of the border where the U.S. and Turkey had been trying to work out a compromise \"safe zone\" arrangement.\n\nSenior Pentagon officials said repeatedly that there was frequent communication with the Turks to avoid accidents on the ground and in the air. But one U.S. official with knowledge of the ground said Turkey's actions were unilateral and potentially \"dangerous to coalition forces and civilians.\" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters.\n\nIt quickly became clear Turkey was more aggressive than expected. Two days into the offensive, just after 9 p.m. Turkish artillery fired near a well-identified U.S. observation point on a hill outside of the town of Kobani, 70 kilometers (44 miles) west of that zone.\n\nThe Turkish military said it was responding to Kurdish fire coming from a position about a kilometer (0.6 miles) away from the post. It said it took precautions before firing to prevent harm to the Americans and ceased fire upon \"receiving information\" from the U.S military.\n\nBut the U.S. official cast doubt on that, saying the American post would have seen Kurdish fire and gone on alert.\n\nKobani was a scene of the first major battle to drive out IS in 2014, making it a symbol of U.S.-Kurdish cooperation against the militants. Capturing Kobani would have made it possible for Turkey to link up its territories it holds to the west with newly captured areas to the east.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed the incident and said it warned Turkey to avoid actions that could cause defensive reaction. No troops were injured but the Americans left the outpost.", "description": "The crowd hurled potatoes that thudded on the sides of the hulking U.S. armored vehicles.  \"What happened to Americans?\" one man shouted in English up at the sole U.S. soldier visible on the back of a vehicle.
