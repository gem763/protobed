Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., went on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" on Thursday to explain why she's challenging AOC -- and why she thinks she'll unseat the freshman Dem lawmaker.\n\nActivist Badrun Khan, who is challenging Ocasio-Cortez for the Democratic nomination to represent New York's 14th Congressional District, said the media darling is not doing enough to represent her constituents.\n\n\u201cShe is Hollywood and Washington,\u201d said Khan, the daughter of Bengali immigrants.\n\nWhat's more, she said the worldview of Ocasio-Cortez is not indicative of their Queens constituency, claiming: \u201cThey aren\u2019t looking for socialism.\u201d\n\nKhan says on her website that she'll provide \"REAL Results... Not Empty Promises.\"\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ SLAMMED AS 'FINANCIALLY ILLITERATE' AT SHARPTON EVENT OVER AMAZON, FACES CALLS TO BE OUSTED FROM OFFICE\n\nKhan took issue with the role Ocasio-Cortez played in Amazon's last-minute decision to cancel plans to establish a second headquarters in New York City. AOC has been blamed for the company's decision to scrap a proposal that Amazon promised would bring thousands of jobs to the city.\n\nKhan said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a chance to speak on that. \u2026 I don\u2019t think it was fair for the community.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe said she lives in reality, and Ocasio-Cortez lives in dreams.\n\nKhan said she wants to enhance Medicare and Social Security but appeared to take a shot at \"Medicare-for-all\" -- a plan championed by progressives like Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cI am not a politician, I am a mother,\u201d Khan said. \u201cEverything is easier said -- how is it going to be done?\u201d", "description": "A primary challenger to\u00a0Rep.
