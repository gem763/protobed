The two votes by the national committee and the group's members and grassroots supporters were weighted equally.\n\nBut the progressive, union-allied group declined to release the vote breakdown.\n\n\"The final result is the only number we ever planned to release,\" Duffey said. \"It represents the inputs from all the constituencies that make up the WFP.\"\n\nDuffey said a WFP member is anyone who pays dues of $10 per month or $120 in the past year, and that a WFP supporter is anyone who has previously engaged with the group and signed up for the WFP's email or text list.\n\nThe New York Times reported that 56 people sit on the WFP national committee. According to Duffey, each vote is a delegate casting a vote on behalf of their state chapter or local branch.\n\nThe endorsement was notable in that Sanders won the group\u2019s support in the 2016 primary against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGOP struggles with retirement wave Overnight Energy: Trump to revoke California's tailpipe waiver | Democrats propose bill to revoke Trump endangered species rollback | Trump officials finalize rule allowing fewer inspectors at pork plants Mark Mellman: The most important moment in history?
