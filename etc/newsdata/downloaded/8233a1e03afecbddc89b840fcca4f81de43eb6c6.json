Here is what it could mean for consumers:\n\nA worker fills fuel at a gaz station in Kuwait city, Kuwait September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Stephanie McGehee\n\nWHERE WILL I FEEL THE COST INCREASES?\n\nConsumers around the world could see costs rise for products ranging from gasoline and diesel to home heating costs and air fares, after this weekend\u2019s attacks caused a spike in global oil prices. As the cost of transportation rises, that could mean shipments of other goods, such as groceries, could also increase in the coming months.\n\nHOW DOES THE PRICE OF OIL FACTOR INTO THE DIESEL AND GASOLINE PRICE?\n\nCrude oil is refined into fuel including gasoline and diesel. When crude prices rise, the cost of fuel rises with it. Other factors are also important in the retail price, such as local taxes and fuel standard regulations. Crude, however, is the biggest factor.\n\n\u201cCrude accounts for 50% of the (U.S.) retail price, so as crude goes up, so does the retail,\u201d said American Automobile Association spokeswoman Jeanette Casselano.\n\nWHY IS SAUDI ARABIA SO IMPORTANT TO THIS EQUATION?\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest crude exporter and one of the top producers. The attack removed half of its output- 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or the equivalent to 5 percent of global supplies.\n\nSaudi Arabia is also the holder of nearly all the world\u2019s spare oil capacity - which means the ability to increase output quickly to compensate for any problems in supply worldwide. So any further large supply disruption will impact oil supply and prices more than they would have done if Saudi Arabia still had spare capacity.\n\nBefore the attack, Saudi Arabia was shipping 7 million barrels of oil around the world daily, much of it to Asian buyers.\n\nWHEN WILL PRICES START TO RISE?\n\nVery soon. Prices at the pump respond very quickly to moves in futures markets, which have risen sharply on Monday in response to the attacks.\n\nIn the United States, drivers could see gasoline prices at the pump start to rise as early as this week and prices could climb as much as 25 cents this month. The U.S. gasoline RBc1 and diesel futures HOc1 contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose more than 12% and 10%, respectively, on Monday.\n\nHOW CAN THE RISING PRICE OF FUEL RAISE OTHER COSTS?\n\nPrices for fuel, especially diesel, which fuels heavier-duty vehicles such as trucks and farming equipment, are expected to rise. That will affect transportation costs for companies to ship products from the factory and the farm.\n\nManufacturing industries that require a lot of energy supply like automotive production and chemicals could also pass on costs if their expenses increase.\n\nConsumers, therefore, could see costs increase for items at their grocery stores like fresh produce, which often has to be shipped from other regions.\n\nFuel price increases are expected throughout the world\u2019s major economies, with countries in Asia particularly sensitive to spikes because of their energy-intensive manufacturing industry, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York.\n\nDepending on how long Saudi exports are affected, consumers could also see increased ticket prices for air travel because of a price premium on jet fuel for aircraft, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\nHome heating oil could also get a bump in price, at a time when demand is starting to rise in the United States and Europe as temperatures drop ahead of winter.\n\nWHY IS THE PRICE EXPECTED TO RISE? ISN\u2019T THERE ANY OIL IN STORAGE WORLDWIDE?\n\nYes, there is. Members of the Paris-based International Energy Administration are required to keep at least 90 days of crude oil and/or products imports in storage in case of situations like this. The United States has already said it could use its petroleum reserves if needed, and Saudi Arabia also has enough storage to cover exports for a certain period of time.\n\nHowever, markets globally are still affected because it is unclear how long Saudi Arabia will need to repair the damage and resume exports.\n\nAREN\u2019T GASOLINE PRICES RELATIVELY LOW RIGHT NOW ANYWAY?\n\nYes. The average price for a regular gallon of gasoline is currently $2.56, according to the American Automotive Association. That\u2019s far short of levels typically associated with reduced spending from consumers. In 2008, amid a global economic downturn, a surge in oil prices pushed the average gallon of gasoline to a record $4.11, according to AAA.", "description": "The attack on Saudi facilities on Saturday caused the biggest oil supply disruption for more than 50 years.
