But on Sunday, the tens of thousands of home fans inside Yokohama Stadium were there to live every second of the Brave Blossoms\u2019 28-21 triumph against Scotland.\n\nJapan captain Michael Leitch says victory \u2018was about more than just us\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cI expected us to win, but now that we\u2019ve actually done it I\u2019m in shock,\u201d said Japan fan Atsushi Moritani. \u201cI\u2019m full of admiration for Horie and Leitch for the way they played tonight. They showed courage, and I hope they passed some of that on to people who are struggling tonight after the typhoon.\u201d\n\nThe home crowd refused to stop believing, with roars of \u201cNippon!\u201d filling the stadium as Scotland threatened to snatch away the hosts\u2019 dream of reaching the last eight for the first time since the Rugby World Cup began 32 years ago.\n\nIn the quarter-finals Japan must overcome South Africa, the shock losers in their \u201cBrighton Miracle\u201d encounter four years ago \u2013 a celebration spoiled by Scotland a few days later when they sent Japan out of the 2015 tournament.\n\nKoji Hoshino, an office worker from Tokyo, said the victory was sweet revenge for Scotland\u2019s win against Japan in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this for four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is important for the people here and it is important for the country. I don\u2019t know how far we\u2019ll go \u2026 but we can dream.\u201d\n\nEmily Finch, an Anglo-Japanese woman who travelled from London to watch the rugby, said: \u201cIt was an incredibly stressful morning after the typhoon wondering if the Japan vs Scotland match could actually happen or not. I don\u2019t think we found out until around 11am if the match would actually go ahead and I\u2019d come all the way to Japan for just two games so I would have been devastated if Japan didn\u2019t play today.\n\nPlay Video 0:36 Rugby World Cup: Japan defeat Scotland, Wales stutter against Uruguay \u2013 video highlights\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe how happy I am to see Japan win against Scotland especially as Japan is not an old rugby nation and are the underdogs. Scotland played well but Japan just seemed to want victory so much more and ultimately annihilated them. I cannot be happier.\n\n\u201cBeing half-Japanese half-British myself, it\u2019s fantastic to see the whole country back such a diverse Japanese team. It truly shows Japan is starting to change their definition of what it means to be actually \u2018Japanese\u2019 and accept all kind of backgrounds into their country.\n\n\u201cMy dad bought the tickets for this match last year but he sadly died unexpectedly in May and he couldn\u2019t make it so I came in his place with his best mate. He would have loved watching Japan beat Scotland.\u201d\n\nFans in replica shirts were mingling with Scotsmen in kilts posing for photographs outside the stadium a couple of hours after World Rugby announced that the match would go ahead.\n\nThere was no such reprieve for the northeastern town of Kamaishi, where flooding had left the organisers with no choice but to cancel the lunchtime game between Canada and Namibia. It was a cruel blow for the town, whose involvement in the tournament is inextricably linked with another natural disaster \u2013 the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, in which almost 19,000 people died, including more than 1,000 in Kamaishi.\n\nWith their match at the Recovery Memorial Stadium cancelled, Canadian players grabbed shovels and helped clear the mud from Kamaishi\u2019s streets. Residents flew fishermen\u2019s flags at 12.15pm, the time the match should have kicked off, while volunteers repaired the fan zone to ensure it was ready for Japan\u2019s evening kick-off against with Scotland.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fans watching from Tokyo celebrate after Japan score a try against Scotland.

They are rebuilding the Fan Zone, as I type, for the community to come together and continue celebrating,\u201d tweeted Jennifer Nieuwendyk, a Canadian rugby fan.\n\nIn Yokohama, the talk among home supporters was of resilience and the potential for sport to lift the gloom, even for a couple of hours. Japan had fought for their win beneath clear night skies, but on a day that had started with news of the death and destruction Typhoon Hagibis had left in its wake.\n\nWorld Rugby attempted to reassure visiting fans about large amounts of water that had built up around the stadium, which is located within the city\u2019s engineered flood defences. \u201cThis is normal and should not alarm fans,\u201d the governing body said in a statement.\n\nMasaya Nara, a Yokohama resident who was at the match with his son, said: \u201cI totally understand why some people felt it was inappropriate to hold the match here after the typhoon, and I wondered if perhaps I felt the same way. But for the same reason it\u2019s important for Japan to win and give people heart \u2026 you can see it from both sides.\u201d\n\nJapan show world their defiance and skill in face of typhoon destruction | Andy Bull Read more\n\nFittingly, the teams\u2019 first duty once they entered a stadium filled with the red and white of the home support was to observe a moment\u2019s silence for the 25 people reported to have died in the typhoon. Bill Beaumont, the World Rugby chairman, said in a statement: \u201cOn behalf of World Rugby, our thoughts and sympathies are with everyone in Japan at this difficult time.\n\n\u201cJapan has proven to be the warmest, the best of Rugby World Cup hosts. We stand together with you in solidarity. Such devastation and threat to human life places everything into perspective and, while we have been doing everything we can to ensure \u2026 matches take place as scheduled, the bigger picture of wellbeing and safety is far more important.\u201d\n\nLike many other travelling home fans, Scotland supporter Chris McGill, who was combining rugby matches with a business trip to Japan, had set his alarm early to wait for World Rugby\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhen there was an earthquake in Tokyo as well as the typhoon I thought, now it\u2019s going to be an act of God that sends us home,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to say that the Japanese authorities have done a great job, but your heart has to go out to the people who have been affected by the typhoon.\u201d\n\nAs Japan\u2019s players hugged each other and shook the hands of the team they had sent out of the tournament, the crowd stayed on their feet and clapped their way through the J-pop hit Rising Sun. After another breathtaking night for Japanese rugby, Michael Leitch and his men must now answer the question: how high can the sun go?", "description": "Home crowd refused to stop believing in their side who showed resilience and provide hope in a difficult moment", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/683ecdce83f03a84b2c8f381b5ef44199ac4fce1/0_161_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e72caf2692d8e9bfa9a9ac35143bd432", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
