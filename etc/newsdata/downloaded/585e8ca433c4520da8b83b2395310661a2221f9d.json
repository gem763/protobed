The original plan was to erect it near the Palais de Tokyo, a contemporary art museum, but that was later criticised for lacking a connection with the attacks.\n\nIn January 2018, a letter drafted by artists urged government officials to abandon the \"shocking\" project, but they later selected the site at Le Petit Palais.\n\nWho is Jeff Koons?\n\nThe 64-year-old US artist's sculptures have provoked controversy for decades after he emerged as a leading figure in New York's art scene in the 1980s.\n\nKoons' artworks are often large colourful balloon-like structures, such as puppies and swans, and made from steel. He already has a sculpture of multicoloured balloon tulips exhibited in the Guggenheim in Bilbao.\n\nHe has also displayed large inflatable pieces around New York.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A 45ft (14m) high inflatable ballerina by Koons outside the Rockefeller Center in New York in 2017\n\nHe previously held the record price for a living artist's work for his piece Balloon Dog, which fetched $58,4m (\u00a336.7m) at auction.\n\nThe artist also created a series of pornographic artworks which some critics considered vulgar and unacceptable.", "description": "The large artwork is criticised for looking like marshmallows or parts of human anatomy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qbxlv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
