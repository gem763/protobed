(Steven Senne/AP)\n\nBOSTON \u2014 Actress Felicity Huffman is scheduled Friday afternoon to be the first parent sentenced in the college admission bribery scandal, as a federal judge here weighs whether to send her to prison for paying $15,000 to help one of her daughters obtain a fake SAT score.\n\nProsecutors are recommending a month of incarceration for Huffman, plus a year of supervised release and a $20,000 fine. Her attorneys contend jail is unwarranted, proposing instead a year of probation, 250 hours of community service and the same fine. Huffman pleaded guilty in May to fraud conspiracy and has expressed remorse.\n\nThe punishment U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani chooses for Huffman could influence perceptions of what sentences should, or will, be delivered to others convicted in an extraordinary scandal that has shaken public confidence in college admissions. Fifty-one people, including 34 parents, have been charged in the investigation prosecutors call Varsity Blues.\n\n\u201cIn a way, it will help set the market,\u201d said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University. \u201cOther judges and other lawyers and other defendants are going to be looking at the Huffman outcome as a gauge. \u2026 The $64 million question is, does she spend a night behind bars?\"\n\nHuffman held the hand of her husband, William H. Macy, as she walked past a large media stakeout in Boston and into the federal courthouse Friday afternoon, about 45 minutes ahead of the 2:30 p.m. hearing.\n\nIn March, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, disclosed the stunning bribery and cheating scheme to subvert the college admissions process.\n\n[FBI accuses wealthy parents, including celebrities, in college-entrance bribery scheme]\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, an admissions consultant in California, acknowledged orchestrating illicit efforts to help the children of wealthy clients obtain phony SAT or ACT scores and use fabricated athletic credentials to pose in the application process as recruits for sports such as tennis, water polo and soccer. Singer pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes and cooperated with investigators. He has not been sentenced.\n\nHuffman was accused of participating in the test-rigging part of the scam, but not the athletic-recruiting deception.\n\nHuffman, 56, of Los Angeles, won an Emmy in 2005 for her portrayal of Lynette Scavo in the ABC television series \u201cDesperate Housewives.\u201d She has had numerous other credits in television and film.\n\nProsecutors say Huffman arranged with Singer in 2017 to obtain an inflated SAT score for her daughter by having a proctor manipulate the answers. In February 2018, prosecutors say, Huffman paid a Singer-controlled charity $15,000 to reimburse him for bribes that put their plan in motion. The daughter, who has not been charged in the case, obtained a score of 1420 out of a maximum 1600.\n\nIn a sentencing recommendation filed last week, prosecutors argued that prison time for Huffman is essential to send a message. \u201cIn the context of this case,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201cneither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes.\u201d\n\nThey added that \u201ccommunity service, especially for the famous, is hardly a punishment \u2014 which is why many non-felons gladly perform it in the absence of court orders.\u201d\n\nHuffman\u2019s attorneys, Martin F. Murphy and Julia Amrhein, wrote to the court that prison time is not warranted for a client who \u201cis remorseful \u2014 indeed, deeply ashamed \u2014 about what she did.\u201d They noted that Huffman paid far less than other parents charged in the scheme and did not attempt to participate in the elaborate manufacturing of fraudulent athletic portfolios that others used to target admissions offices at prominent universities.\n\n\u201cThe Court does not have to send Ms. Huffman to prison to deter others from engaging in similar criminal conduct,\u201d the attorneys wrote.\n\nHuffman is one of 15 parents who have pleaded guilty in the case. Nineteen accused parents \u2014 including actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli \u2014 are fighting the charges.\n\n[Universities race to quell outrage over bribery and cheating scandal in admissions]\n\nIn a memo to the court, prosecutors recommended sentences of one month to 15 months of incarceration for 11 parents who pleaded guilty. Factors influencing those recommendations, prosecutors said, were the amount of the bribes paid by each parent, their degree of participation in the scheme and whether the parent repeated the scam.\n\nHuffman ultimately backed out after taking steps toward obtaining a fraudulent score for her younger daughter.\n\n\u201cI have a deep and abiding shame over what I have done,\u201d Huffman wrote in a letter Sept. 4 to Talwani. \u201cShame and regret that I will carry for the rest of my life. It is right that I should carry this burden and use it as fuel for change in my own life and hopefully it will be a cautionary tale for my daughters and the community.\u201d\n\nThe first sentence in the Varsity Blues case was seen as a setback for prosecutors. Former Stanford University sailing coach John Vandemoer, who had pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, was sentenced in June to one day of incarceration for his role in the scandal. He was given credit for time already served, and avoided being sent to prison.\n\nAnderson reported from Washington.", "description": "Prosecutors are recommending a month in jail after the actress pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy.", "authors": ["Karen Weintraub", "Joelle Renstrom", "Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EYEvpXkv9zWJrFZlQjEBRu8wgTg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7NCL42DVUEI6TJ57ZCSDXBHOGE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
