Mandatory Credit: Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\u201cI\u2019m told that is a safe assumption (that Vinatieri will retire), but the Colts aren\u2019t ready to give up,\u201d Florio said on Football Night in America. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna try to talk him into staying. They expect to have an answer by tomorrow afternoon.\u201d\n\nVinatieri \u2014 who missed a pair of extra points Sunday and has seven missed kicks in his last three games \u2014 didn\u2019t take questions from reporters, saying \u201cYou\u2019ll hear from me (Monday).\u201d When reminded that reporters don\u2019t see players on Mondays, Vinatieri replied, \u201cYeah, you will.\u201d\n\nThat spurred speculation that the NFL\u2019s all-time leading scorer plans to retire.\n\nFormer Colts teammate Pat McAfee tweeted on the subject, writing, \u201cFolks thinkin Vinatieri\u2019s retiring.. I sent a text, haven\u2019t gotten a response yet but, I do know that the game\u2019ll miss him if that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nVinatieri, who turns 47 in December, missed two field goals \u2014 including a 29-yarder \u2014 and an extra point in last week\u2019s overtime loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. He also missed a 23-yard field goal and an extra point in the Colts\u2019 divisional playoff loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in January.\n\nHead coach Frank Reich said after the game he has \u201czero concern\u201d about Vinatieri\u2019s reliability.\n\n\u201cHe hit the upright on the one,\u201d Reich said. \u201cYou guys probably saw the first one. It was not a good operation. That snap and hold was not clean, the ball barely got on the ground. It was not clean.\u201d\n\nOwner Jim Irsay did not sound as assured.\n\n\u201cBreaks my heart to see it, because I know how hard he works,\u201d Irsay said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a concern. I can\u2019t lie to you guys. Anyone would tell you it\u2019s a concern. Adam, coach Reich, (general manager) Chris (Ballard), me. Yeah, I mean, in this league, it\u2019s professional football. We all have to produce.\u201d\n\nThe Colts hung on to win 19-17 after T.Y. Hilton\u2019s go-ahead touchdown with 4:38 remaining, after which Vinatieri hit the right upright. The Titans did not reach field-goal range on their final two possessions, which kept the miss from factoring.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The Indianapolis Colts are hoping to convince kicker Adam Vinatieri not to retire, NBC's Mike Florio reported Sunday evening, after the 46-year-old missed two more kicks in Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430280158&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F00U-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
