You know, I apologize if my language offended anyone.\"\n\nThe Cardinals will open the NL Championship Series against the Washington Nationals on Friday. After the win over the Braves, Shildt spouted off to his team in the locker room and the remarks caused a firestorm once they became public.\n\n\"The (Braves) started some (expletive). We finished the (expletive), and that's how we roll,\" Shildt said. \"No one (expletive) with us ever. Now, I don't give a (expletive) who we play. We're gonna (expletive) them up. We're gonna take it right to them the whole (expletive) way. We're gonna kick their (expletive) ass.\"\n\nArozarena, a 24-year-old Cuba native, posted the video on Instagram but later deleted it and posted an apology in Spanish.\n\nThe subsequent text, translated to English, read, \"I want to apologize to my teammates, manager, the Cardinals Organization and baseball fans for the video I posted tonight after the victory of our team in Atlanta. This was a moment that should have been private with my team and I made a rookie mistake by sharing it on my social media account.\"\n\nShildt said the salty language is something he is trying to cut down on and he said it was regrettable that the video became public.\n\n\"It's not something I like to represent, it's not to be excused, it's supposed to be a private moment,\" Shildt said. \"But I will say that I'm flawed, I have my moments. I grew up in a clubhouse and one of the crosses I bear is my language. So I have done a nice job over the many years of curbing that and trying to represent always this organization and myself in a positive light, with class and dignity. I feel like I've always done that.\n\n\"It was regretful that that was able to get out. I will not apologize for having passion about how I feel about our team and the accomplishments of our team. So I just want to get that out there. It's not anything I want to talk about moving forward, we got baseball to play.\"\n\nArozarena appeared in the first 19 games of his major league career this season, going 6-for-20 (.300) with one homer and two RBIs. He made substitute appearances in the NLDS, finishing 0-for-3.\n\nShildt, 51, is in his first full season as the Cardinals' manager. He took over in the middle of 2018 and produced a 41-28 mark, then led St. Louis to a 91-71 record this year and the NL Central championship.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "A day after Mike Shildt's profane postgame comments were posted online, the  St. Louis Cardinals manager apologized for his language but not for his  passion...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
