Harper says a group of Washington Nationals fans crossed the line with their heckling during Wednesday\u2019s game.\n\nHarper did not get into specifics, but said the fans got particularly nasty in the final two innings of the Phillies\u2019 5-2 loss, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cThey were fine all game, talking about myself and things like that,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI get it everywhere I go. That\u2019s nothing new. But the last two innings, it\u2019s just not right. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHarper also praised his current fans in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got 60,000 fans up in Philly that appreciate me as a player, appreciate me as an individual and my family, as well,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI owe a lot to those people up there in Philly because they show up for me every single night and they\u2019re there to cheer us on and boo us and keep us going as a team and as individuals as well.\u201d\n\nWhile Harper declined to reveal what the fans said, his wife, Kayla Harper, said the fans started heckling Harper about his infant son.\n\nWhen you bring his son or family into it, yes you\u2019re crossing a line. Stick to your overused overrated and Harper sucks chants if you\u2019re really that loser that goes to a game to heckle someone. Phillies fans might boo him but they don\u2019t bring his 4 week old son into it. Classless https://t.co/NVj3ixyrPY \u2014 Kayla Harper (@kayyharper8) September 26, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 26-year-old Harper spent his first seven seasons with the Nationals before signing a $13-year, $330 million deal with the Phillies in the offseason. After a slow first half, Harper has improved over the final months of the season, and is now hitting .260/.375/.507.\n\nThat slow start caused Harper to hear some boos from Phillies fans throughout the season. What happened Wednesday night in Washington, D.C. was much worse, according to Harper.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
