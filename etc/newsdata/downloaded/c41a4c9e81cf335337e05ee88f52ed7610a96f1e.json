That would ensure Scotland fail to reach the quarter-finals for just the second time in the tournament\u2019s history.\n\nTownsend said he was unsure whether World Rugby had back-up plans, with media reports suggesting they were considering shifting games to other cities or to other dates.\n\n\u201cWe will be getting updates from World Rugby over the next two days over what the contingencies are,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am sure that alternative venues or arrangements are being looked at. Not just our game, but England and France play in the same stadium the night before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s getting looked at for the Ireland-Samoa game (on Saturday) as well, with it being first forecast as (hitting) Fukuoka.\u201d\n\nTownsend said he felt his players had done what was required on Wednesday to put themselves in position to dash the hopes of the tournament hosts of reaching the knock-out stages for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough game,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cThe scoreline doesn\u2019t suggest that, but the effort that went into getting that scoreline by putting pressure on the Russian defence to open up spaces was huge from my players.\n\n\u201cGetting the bonus point ... we knew that if we hadn\u2019t got that, Sunday would have been difficult, so getting that was excellent.\n\n\u201cGetting a big score will also keep things interesting for Saturday, as well with the Ireland-Samoa game.\n\n\u201cBut also for the confidence - the players know that for two games now we haven\u2019t conceded a point, that\u2019s very encouraging.\u201d", "description": "Scotland will continue to prepare as planned for their crucial Pool A clash with Japan in Yokohama on Sunday despite the fixture being threatened by a powerful typhoon tracking towards the Tokyo region, coach Gregor Townsend said.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438823348&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF98121", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
