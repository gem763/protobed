He helped spark a movement that has spread to over 80 communes across France.\n\nToday the court annulled the decree, which it had already suspended in August.\n\nThe mayor told AFP he is \"obviously disappointed\" about the ruling \"because it's a matter of public health.\"\n\n\"The court's judgment is so poorly argued that it's incredible and does not take into account the proof we provided whatsoever,\" he said.\n\nCueff wanted to ban phytosanitary products over fears they would damage the health of Langou\u00ebt's inhabitants. He and his lawyer argued that the French government does not do enough to protect its citizens from toxic pesticides.\n\nBut the prefect of the department said Cueff's bill was \"marred with incompetence\" and that there was \"no imminent danger\" posed by pesticides. The court ruled that a village mayor cannot introduce pesticides legislation, which is under the remit of the agriculture ministry.\n\nIn the summer, President Emmanuel Macron praised Cueff\u2019s \u201cintentions\u201d for tackling glyphosate but stated that the decree did not comply with the law.\n\nCueff has two months to appeal the court's decision.", "description": "Daniel Cueff wants to protect the health of his 600 citizens by banning glyphosate.", "authors": ["Eddy Wax"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175261849-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
