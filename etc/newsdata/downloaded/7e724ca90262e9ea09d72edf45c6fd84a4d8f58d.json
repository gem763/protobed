Una won a Nintendo Switch Lite and HK$500 in eShop vouchers. Be sure to follow us on Instagram and Facebook for news about our next awesome competition.\n\nEight travellers, eight stories, and one fascinating tale of intersecting fate. Whatever hero you play as \u2013 be it the warrior, the scholar, or the merchant \u2013 Octopath Traveller draws you into the mesmerising world of Orsterra.\n\nDeveloped by Square Enix of Final Fantasy fame, Octopath Traveller is a beautiful homage to classic Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs) of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System era, and is amazingly fun to play.\n\nOctopath\u2019s turn-based combat system is nothing new, but the battles are far from boring thanks to the introduction of new in-game mechanics such as enemy \u201cshields\u201d and \u201cboost points\u201d, which increase your attack strength. The experience of figuring out your enemy\u2019s weaknesses and pacing your blows for that final shield break is delightful, and it\u2019s even more rewarding when your umpteenth attempt at the same battle pays off with a sweet, hard-earned victory.\n\nMario Kart Tour game review: Mobile version of Nintendo racer is ruined by greedy microtransactions\n\nThe most intriguing aspect of the game is the skills system. Players can spend hours poring over the intuitive skill selection interface since, as the game progresses, skills that at first seem useless may be needed to win against specific enemies.\n\nHowever, Octopath Traveller is not for the faint of heart, and boasts a steep levelling curve. The difference in ability and between levels is brutal, and a meagre five-level gap between you and your enemy is enough to result in a complete, devastating knockout.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, areas that move the story forward are also level-locked. Unless you prevail through random encounters against much tougher opponents, there\u2019s no way to reach the next chapter of the quest. Not only does this break the flow of the narrative, the sheer amount of grind needed to level up becomes frustratingly irritating. Although the game offers an impressive variety of subclasses and weapons to increase your chances at advancing, it\u2019s still a poor remedy for a fixable flaw.\n\nIs Octopath Traveller a good game? You bet. Does it live up to the hype? Depends. Though somewhat too demanding in the difficulty department, Octopath Traveller is a game that\u2019s perfect for those who just want to sit back, relax, and take a trip down memory lane to the heyday of 16-bit JRPGs.", "description": "From 'Final Fantasy' developer Square Enix, this throwback has great (but challenging) gameplay and wonderful visuals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/2164b8f4-ea56-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires171430.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
