However, his mention of the city was far less conciliatory than Pence's.\n\n\"We're going to fight for the future of cities like Baltimore that have been destroyed by decades of failed and corrupt rule,\" Trump said.\n\nThursday marked Trump's first visit to Baltimore since attacking Cummings and his district, which includes the city, in late July following an Oversight panel hearing on conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"The Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded,\" Trump tweeted at the time.\n\nThe district Cummings represents, Trump wrote, \"is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place.\"\n\n\"No human being would want to live there,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump's attack on Cummings, who is African American, came after he suggested that four minority freshman congresswoman \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\"\n\nThe FBI reported last year that Baltimore had the worst homicide rate among the nation's largest cities and the second-highest violent crime rate overall.\n\nHouse Republicans scheduled their retreat in Baltimore before Trump disparaged the city.\n\n\u201cI think the president coming here symbolizes that, yes, he cares about Baltimore, he cares about the people that live in Baltimore and he does not accept that you have to stay in poverty,\u201d McCarthy told reporters at a press conference.", "description": "BALTIMORE \u2014 Vice President Pence extended an olive branch to Rep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pence_mike_podium_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
