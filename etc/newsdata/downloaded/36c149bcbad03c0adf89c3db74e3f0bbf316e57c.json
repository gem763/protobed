Photo: Johannes Eisele/AFP via Getty Images\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders is hosting a major rally in Queensbridge Park in Long Island City on Saturday, which not only marks the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s return to the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack in early October, but in which he\u2019ll be joined for the first time by his new big-name endorser, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As Intelligencer\u2019s Gabriel Debenedetti noted in his preview of the event, with a little over three months remaining before voters begin weighing in on the Democratic primary race, the Sanders campaign hopes the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally will not only help counteract concerns about his health, but act \u201cas a triumphant return to the trail just in time for the campaign to get serious.\u201d\n\nBelow are updates and images from the rally, which got started at 1 p.m.\n\nWatch Live\n\nAOC Recounts How She Was Inspired by Sanders\n\nAOC starts off her speech at Bernie Sanders' rally with a tongue in check question: \"You all like my haircut?
