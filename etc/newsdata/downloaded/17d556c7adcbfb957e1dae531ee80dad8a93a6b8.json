Not fully, at least.\n\nAfter seeing this tweet, a source close to @DonaldJTrumpJr said this of @LindseyGrahamSC: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk the talk on Fox, you better walk the walk in the chamber. And a resolution is just talk. People expect action.\u201d https://t.co/1EK2namVj2 \u2014 Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 24, 2019\n\nThe president and his inner circle want to know why his most loyal crony isn\u2019t being as loyal as they\u2019d like lately. Bad enough that Graham would join in the chorus attacking Trump for abandoning the Kurds, but now he won\u2019t even use his power on the Judiciary Committee to launch investigations into the Burisma and CrowdStrike matters. What the hell are they even keeping this guy around for if he won\u2019t counterprogram the impeachment inquiry for them?\n\nRand Paul\u2019s doing some solid crony work for Trump by leaning on Graham too:\n\nI\u2019m fully supportive of @LindseyGrahamSC symbolic resolution to condemn the secret impeachment proceedings in the House of Reps. How about the @senjudiciary actually hold hearings and subpoena witnesses to find out how this hoax got started? Long past due! \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) October 24, 2019\n\nGraham\u2019s offering this new resolution as an olive branch to the White House in lieu of holding hearings. He\u2019s said elsewhere that he doesn\u2019t think Burisma and CrowdStrike are within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, that they\u2019re more properly left to the Intelligence Committee \u2014 which is probably true but unlikely to appease Trump, who cares nothing for formalities. In truth, Graham\u2019s probably just worried about the high downside risk to him of opening those two probes. The CrowdStrike hearing will likely end up with people like Tom Bossert testifying that Trump\u2019s a crank for believing that there\u2019s some secret server somewhere that proves the DNC hacking was an inside job. The Burisma hearing holds more promise, but Graham may be guessing that it\u2019s unlikely to show wrongdoing by *Joe* Biden. Certainly it can and would show that *Hunter* Biden had no business being on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, suggesting that he was named a director purely so that the company could influence the administration via Joe Biden. But absent evidence that it did influence Biden, or that the corrupt prosecutor whom Biden pressured Ukraine to fire really was intent on investigating Hunter Biden and Burisma, that hearing\u2019s not going to deliver what Trump wants it to deliver.\n\nAnd then guess who\u2019ll be blamed. Right: Lindsey Graham, the crony who proved to be useless to Trump when it mattered. Even if Graham ends up being safely reelected to the Senate next fall, the brownie points he\u2019s earned with the GOP base will be lost. So, unless Graham can be convinced in advance that the Burisma probe really might pay off, what incentive does he have to do it?\n\nInstead he\u2019ll try to placate the president with a formal Senate resolution denouncing the House impeachment process. Interestingly, he has Mitch McConnell\u2019s support on that. Cocaine Mitch is in his own awkward spot with Trump right now, as you already know if you read this post on Tuesday. McConnell\u2019s been critical of the president on Syria, he contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that the two had spoken by phone about the Ukraine call, and he declined to defend Trump\u2019s description of the House process as a \u201clynching.\u201d And the media has noticed. Maybe McConnell has concluded that there\u2019s a little too much distance between him and the president at a moment when Republican voters are demanding unity and so he decided to throw Trump a bone in the form of Graham\u2019s resolution. It\u2019ll buy him \u2014 and the vulnerable Senate Republicans who are on the ballot next fall \u2014 a little cheap cred with the base while they wait for impeachment to move forward, a signal that they\u2019re still on the team for now as they mull whether to remove the president.\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting is that McConnell must have reason to believe that 51 Republicans will support this resolution. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t let it come to the floor, right? It\u2019d be a total messaging disaster for the GOP if Graham moved to denounce the House proceedings and then Romney, Murkowski, and a few others switched sides to vote with Schumer. Although, really, why would Romney et al. do that in this case? The resolution means nothing and it\u2019s an easy opportunity to show solidarity with the party on a low-stakes vote. That\u2019s the reason McConnell\u2019s supporting it. Just dunk on the Democrats here and hope that satisfies Trump\u2019s fans for a few weeks.\n\nLindsey knows what to say to satisfy them:\n\n\u201cIf we were doing this, you\u2019d be beating the sh\u2013 out of us,\u201d Graham bluntly told a reporter at one point, accusing Democrats of selectively leaking testimony from their closed-door hearings, without affording Republicans the opportunity to subpoena or publicly cross-examine witnesses. \u201cAnd, I think it says a lot about people in your business, with all due respect.\u201d\u2026 Graham\u2019s resolution specifically called on the House to vote immediately to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry; and demanded that the House \u201cprovide President Trump, like every other American, with due process, to include the ability to confront his accusers, call witnesses on his behalf, and have a basic understanding of the accusations against him that would form any basis for impeachment.\u201d\u2026 \u201cIf we pulled this stunt, you\u2019d be eating us alive,\u201d Graham said at the news conference. \u201cHow many people have asked me about [diplomat] Bill Taylor\u2019s opening statement? If we had Rudy Giuliani\u2019s opening statement, and he said he did nothing wrong, I doubt that you would accept that. 47 Republican House members feel like it\u2019s not working for them. They feel like [Kurt] Volker\u2019s testimony has been selectively released, [Rep. John] Ratcliffe\u2019s cross-examination of Taylor is not available to you. \u2026 There\u2019s a way to do it.\u201d\n\nGraham also complained at this afternoon\u2019s presser that \u201cIf you can drive down a president\u2019s poll numbers by having proceedings where you selectively leak information, where the president who\u2019s the subject of all this is pretty much shut out, God help future presidents.\u201d Trump\u2019s job approval is down a few points in the RCP average since the Ukraine story broke big but obviously everything is in flux as the inquiry proceeds. When (not if) he\u2019s acquitted by the Senate after a public trial, he\u2019ll likely recover fully. He may even get a bounce if the Democrats\u2019 evidence at trial turns out to be as thin as House Republicans claim.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of Republican co-sponsors of Graham\u2019s resolution as of 4:45 p.m. ET. There are 44. The nine holdouts are Alexander, Collins, Enzi, Gardner, Isakson, Murkowski, Portman, Romney, and Sullivan. Portman and Sullivan will dutifully join the sponsors but the other seven are \u2026 interesting cases, a mix of anti-Trumpers (Romney and Murkowski), incumbents facing very tough reelection bids (Collins and Gardner), and incumbents who are retiring and thus have nothing to lose by thwarting Trump (Alexander, Enzi, and Isakson). I think the last group will all join with Graham.
