The book \u201cIt,\u201d by Stephen King, is set in 1958 and 1985, so there was some deviation from the original novel.\n\nThe movie opens with the homophobic attack on Adrian. This is featured in the novel but not the 1990 miniseries. King based the event on the real-life 1984 murder of Charlie Howard, a gay man attacked and thrown from the State Street Bridge in Bangor, Maine.\n\nEarly in the film, we\u2019re introduced to the now adult Bill Denbrough on the set of the adaptation his book \u201cAttic Room.\u201d There are two movie references here. The first is that they\u2019re shooting on Warner Bros. Stage 14, a legendary stage responsible for \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d (1951) and \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d (1954). Bill also talks about sliding under the stage door like Indiana Jones.\n\nThe director of \u201cAttic Room\u201d? It\u2019s Peter Bogdanovich, the director of \u201cThe Last Picture Show.\u201d A King connection\u2026 the author makes repeated references to \u201cThe Last Picture Show\u201d in his novel \u201cLisey\u2019s Story,\u201d as character Scott Landon frequently watches the film.\n\nBill\u2019s Beverly-lookalike wife in this scene is played by Jessica Chastain\u2019s real-life BFF, Jess Weixler.\n\nWhen now adult Beverly is reunited with Mike and Ben, we can see the scars on her arm from her abusive husband, Tom Rogan.\n\nBeverly goes to visit her childhood home. It\u2019s inhabited by Mrs. Kersh, as the name on the door changes briefly from Marsh to Kersh. King named the character Mrs. Kersh after Irvin Kershner, the director of \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back.\u201d The 1980 movie was shot in the same studio and at the same time as \u201cThe Shining,\u201d and King even visited the set.\n\nSomething not really featured in the 2017 film is Beverly\u2019s nightmares about Hansel and Gretel. Mrs. Kersh is reminiscent of the witch in the Germanic folk story, making a comment about the hot oven and welcoming Beverly inside for tea just like the children in the fairy tale are welcomed in for sweets.\n\nThere are a few Pennywise clues before Mrs. Kersh transforms into the villain. Beverly spots a number of flies in a circle at the window. And the teacups the two drink out of are oddly reminiscent of Pennywise\u2019s ruff.\n\nThe actress who plays Mrs Kersh, Joan Gregson, is no stranger to King\u2019s work, having starred in ABC\u2019s \u201cStorm of the Century\u201d in 1999.\n\nWe see shop exteriors in the town of Derry, some of which are named after real-life places in Port Hope, Ontario, where the movie was filmed. There is a real Racine Law firm and a Queenies Bake Shop. Fun fact: Queenie was also the name of King\u2019s childhood dog.\n\nInside Derry\u2019s secure institution, a cartoon is playing on the TV. This cartoon is \u201cTom and Jerry: The Truce Hurts,\u201d depicting a steak falling into a sewer. The steak floats away just like Georgie\u2019s boat in \u201cIt.\u201d\n\nThe movie includes lots of flashbacks and locations the characters last saw decades ago, so there are a lot of \u201980s references throughout.\n\nThe Losers return to their underground clubhouse. In a flashback scene, we get a few \u201980s references. Cameo\u2019s 1986 hit \u201cWord Up\u201d is playing. There\u2019s a poster for the 1987 movie \u201cThe Lost Boys,\u201d and one of Michael J. Fox from his 1987 cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nLater in the film, Richie and Eddie are also wearing vintage T-shirts, such as this 1980s Santa Cruz logo tee.\n\nRichie revisits the arcade where he had played Street Fighter, the classic 1980s game. On the wall behind him is a poster for 1998\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d This is the second time Meg Ryan pops up in the movie, as you might recall in the opening scenes Adrian shouts to the bullies: \u201cMeg Ryan called. She wants her wig back.\u201d\n\nBen hides in a locker from Pennywise. Behind him on the locker wall we see a poster of Danny from New Kids on the Block. We also hear him listening to the band in an earlier scene.\n\nHere\u2019s where we also get a nod to a quote from the 1990 miniseries: \u201cKiss me, fatboy!\u201d The Turtle from the books pops up in several places in the movie. There\u2019s a drawing of a turtle on the desk in ben\u2019s classroom, a statue of one outside ben\u2019s house and also an engraving of one on the door to Pennywise\u2019s lair.\n\nKing makes a cameo in the movie, much like he has done in other adaptations of his work. This time he\u2019s an antiques dealer wearing a Neil Young T-shirt.\n\nAn old licence plate near the counter is similar to the CQB 241 licence on the 1958 Plymouth Fury in 1983\u2019s \u201cChristine.\u201d In the \u201cIt\u201d novel, Henry Bowers escapes from the asylum in a cherry-red 1958 Plymouth Fury.\n\nThe store Secondhand Rose is the same from the novel and 1994\u2019s \u201cInsomnia,\u201d Secondhand Rose, Secondhand Clothes.\n\nKing makes a joke at his own expense. Bill asks King\u2019s character if he wants him to sign the book he\u2019s reading, to which King replies no, as the ending was bad. The book\u2019s cover has all the visual hallmarks of a King novel. This parallel between criticisms of King\u2019s work and Bill\u2019s books having bad endings crops up a few times in the movie.\n\nSpeaking of cameos, look out for Andr\u00e9s Muschietti as a customer in the drugstore where Eddie goes to pick up his prescription.\n\nFans have also suggested that one of adult Ben\u2019s boardroom colleagues is none other than Brandon Crane, who played the kid Ben in the 1990 miniseries.\n\nEddie\u2019s wife, Myra Kaspbrak, is played by the same actress who played his mother, Sonia. Guess he never really escaped his mum after all.\n\nIn a scene where Bill runs through a fairground funhouse, the swinging clowns he runs past are dressed up just like Tim Curry\u2019s 1990 version of Pennywise.\n\nAs the gang battles Pennywise, he turns into a monster reminiscent of the spider-legged alien in 1982\u2019s \u201cThe Thing.\u201d This time, it\u2019s Stanley\u2019s head with arachnid legs growing out of it. This is accompanied by a \u201cThe Thing\u201d quote: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d\n\nWhen Beverly struggles for air in the blood-soaked toilet cubicle, a variety of faces try to edge through the door. One of them says \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny!\u201d in reference to \u201cThe Shining.\u201d\n\nAlso written on the bathroom wall is a clue to how Beverly and the gang beat Pennywise. It reads \u201cbig is what IT seems.\u201d Beverly later tells the gang they need to make him feel small to defeat him.\n\nAnother 1980s movie, 1989\u2019s \u201cNightmare on Elm Street 5,\u201d is playing at the movie theatre in the closing shots. In \u201cIt: Chapter 2,\u201d the defeat of Pennywise is almost like a late-series Freddy Krueger movie: surreal and CGI-heavy.\n\nBill receives a phone call from Mike at the end of the movie. In these scenes, he is reading a copy of \u201cA History of Old Derry\u201d by Branson Buddinger. You may recall this book from the first movie as the one Ben reads in Derry Library.\n\nIn fact, the room Bill is in looks quite similar to the office in the final scene of \u201cStand By Me,\u201d where Richard Dreyfuss as The Writer types the movie\u2019s final lines into his computer.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
