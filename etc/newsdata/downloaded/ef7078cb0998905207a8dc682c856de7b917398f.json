While conventional wisdom holds that trying to remove the president could cost House Democrats in battleground seats that Trump won in 2016, there\u2019s a sense in the party that it could improve Democrats\u2019 bid to seize the Senate.\n\n\u201cVoters are going to see this as a stinking fish. I don\u2019t think voters are going to want their member of Congress or Senate to be up here defending the president\u2019s actions,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens when Republicans come back from this [October] recess.\u201d\u2026\n\nSome GOP senators and the Senate Republican campaign arm have also fundraised off impeachment to rile up the conservative base. And so far, most vulnerable Republicans are striking a defiant tone.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s not a hard vote. The facts lead you where they lead. What I\u2019ve seen to this point makes me wonder if it\u2019s going to be anything other than a political exercise,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cHaving the Democrats on record for a frivolous activity on an impeachment vote may be a hard vote for them.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": ""}
