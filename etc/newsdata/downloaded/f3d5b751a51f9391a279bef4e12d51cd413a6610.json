Market pricing indicates an 89% chance of another move at the Oct. 29-30 FOMC meeting.\n\nHowever, Fed officials have been trying to dissuade markets from assuming the committee is intent on longer-run pattern of policy easing.\n\nFollowing July's rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the move as a \"midcycle adjustment.\" Minutes from the September reduction indicated that some members felt the market was anticipating a \"greater provision of accommodation\" than the committee intends.\n\nClarida noted that while the Fed is intent on keeping growth going, he views current conditions as being positive.\n\n\"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and the baseline outlook is favorable,\" he said, while noting that the U.S. \"economy confronts some evident risks in this the 11th year of economic expansion\" such as a slowdown in business investment, exports and manufacturing.\n\n\"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation,\" he added.\n\nCommittee members at the September meeting indicated they see no additional rate cuts this year or in 2020, to be followed by a rate hike in each of the next two years. Markets strongly disagree, with current pricing indicating a long-run funds rate around 1.24%, or half the FOMC's projection of 2.5%.", "description": "\"Looking ahead, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and the Committee will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\" the Fed vice chair said in Boston.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106109485-15675321781721u8a1757.jpg?v=1567540349", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
