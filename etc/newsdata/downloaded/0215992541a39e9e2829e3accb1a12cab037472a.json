The sign down there that says it's an offence to disturb wild life?' the woman says, also holding up a phone to film the interaction.\n\n'We're not disturbing wildlife,' Lincoln replies.\n\n'You're fishing, you're trying to kill fish,' she says.\n\n'There's baby swans here and swans here trying to raise their young and you've got your plastic fishing line out, do you think that's very appropriate? Do you even care?'\n\n'I respect wildlife, I catch and release fish and I follow the law,' Lincoln calmly says.\n\n'I don't know how you live with yourself' the woman then says before storming off.\n\nAlbert Park Lake, just kilometres outside of Melbourne's CBD, is a popular spot to fish as it is stocked with golden perch and rainbow trout.\n\nIn a statement released by the Victorian Fisheries Authority in 2018, the government body revealed it was legal to fish in the lake with a licence and boasted about releasing 15,000 silver perch fingerlings.\n\nHer outburst came as animal activists become more vocal in recent months, stepping up protests and infiltrating farms.\n\nNational protest: Dozens of activists chained themselves to machinery at Carey Bros Abattoir at Yangan in remote Queensland and demanded the release of three lambs\n\nEarlier this month, a group of vegan activists stormed a popular butchers in Perth with signs showing pictures of slaughterhouses.\n\nTheir leader, in a white T-shirt, told customers: 'We are here to shine a light on an inherently cruel industry.'\n\nThe protesters then laid flowers under the display cabinets to 'remember' the animals.\n\nSince the start of the year farms in Australia have been invaded by protesters, with some chaining themselves to machinery.\n\nIn March, about 150 activists stormed Queensland Millmerran Lemontree Feedlot as a distressed farmer looked on.\n\nAbout 20 animal activists allegedly chained themselves at the Yangan abattoir in Queensland in early April.\n\nThe demonstrations - criticised as 'shameful and un-Australian' by Prime Minister Scott Morrison - were loosely organised by a network of meat-free activists to mark a year since the release of a vegan documentary, Dominion.\n\nVegan protesters, meanwhile, who storm through farms will now be slapped with fines of up to $440,000.\n\nVegan protesters who storm through farms will now be slapped with fines of up to $440,000 (pictured: protesters at the Lemontree Feedlot in Millmerran)\n\n\n\n", "description": "A man who was angrily confronted by an animal activist while fishing has rescued a stranded seagull from the back of a boat in Melbourne.", "authors": ["Charlie Co\u00eb", "Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia", "Caters News Agency"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20306206-0-image-a-13_1572309815155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
