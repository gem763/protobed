Firefox has been lagging in terms of Web API adoption, compared to Google Chrome.\n\n\"With four-week cycles, we can be more agile and ship features faster, while applying the same rigor and due diligence needed for a high-quality and stable release,\" Mozilla said today. \"Also, we put new features and implementation of new Web APIs into the hands of developers more quickly.\"\n\nMozilla said the shorter release cycle won't affect beta testing and other experiments as Firefox engineers usually keep new features under review for as long as it's needed.\n\nThe release cycle for Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release), a Firefox version provided to enterprise environments, will remain the same, Mozilla said, with \"a major ESR release every 12 months with 3 months support overlap between new ESR and end-of-life of previous ESR.\"", "description": "Firefox moves to monthly releases from current 6-8 weeks release cycle.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/1346e18c-8b3c-4750-8f9b-10ab3a488dff/thumbnail/770x578/eb0142c1d33e3b0384b1d70d36843e23/firefox.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
