The 1975's third album wrings humour and pathos out of our content-saturated world.\n\nFrontman Matty Healy wrote the album in a flurry of creativity after kicking heroin, and the whirlwind of musical styles can be dizzying - but his compassion and humanity ultimately shine through.\n\nThe critics say: \"A tone of urgent honesty pulses through the album, a visceral need to connect that shatters the production's glittering surfaces.\" [The Telegraph]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Thrilling and thoughtful, eccentric and electric.\"\n\nListen to this: Love It If We Made It [explicit language]\n\nAnna Calvi - Hunter\n\nAnna Calvi described Hunter as her \"queer, feminist\" album - a bolder, freer record than her first two albums (both of which were also nominated for the Mercury Prize).\n\nWritten as a reaction against the way women are \"depicted as being hunted by men\", it sees her rejecting gender conventions (As A Man) and pursuing \"pleasure in all possible ways, free from shame\" (Hunter).\n\nA gutsy, predatory album that highlights Calvi's prowess as a guitar player, it's her most accomplished work to date.\n\nThe critics say: \"A soaring, feverish conflagration of sense and sensuality.\" [Mojo magazine]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"A wildly adventurous musical exploration of sexual identities and desires.\"\n\nListen to this: As A Man\n\nBlack Midi - Schlagenheim\n\nThe debut album by experimental rock band Black Midi has a made-up word for a title. \"It's absolutely meaningless,\" bassist Cameron Picton told All Things Loud.\n\n\"It carries the vessel of those songs, which is why we think it's such a strong title. The only meaning that it could have in the world is being the album title, grouping those songs together.\"\n\nThe songs are equally difficult to define - being slippery, unpredictable indie-jazz-math-rock concoctions that will either intrigue or repel you.\n\nThe critics say: \"There's so much going on here that nothing ever gets bogged down enough to feel indulgent.\" [Rolling Stone]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Black Midi are so wilfully resistant to following any obvious musical path that it is impossible not to enjoy the ride\".\n\nListen to this: Ducter\n\nCate Le Bon - Reward\n\nCate Le Bon spent a year \"sequestered in the Cumbrian mountainside\" while recording her fifth album, living in a rented cottage where she built her own furniture and played piano late into the night.\n\n\"I felt like I may have lost my mind a little at times,\" she said - and while Reward has moments of quiet contemplation, there's an undertow of loss and pain that suggests solitude gave her permission to wallow in her feelings.\n\nBut Le Bon's restless musicality, all honking saxophones and rubber-band basslines, constantly hints at the allure of returning to the real world.\n\nThe critics say: \"Spacious and remarkably constructed, with hidden compartments built for secret sounds that seem to unlock with repeated listenings.\" [Allmusic]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Elegant, urgent and shimmeringly romantic.\"\n\nListen to this: Home To You\n\nDave - Psychodrama\n\nFramed as excerpts from a year-long course of therapy, Dave's debut album grapples with grief, pain, racial identity, domestic abuse and depression (\"I think I'm going mad again,\" he raps on Psycho, \"It's like I'm happy for a second, then I'm sad again\".)\n\nThe music is as thoughtful and introspective as the 21-year-old's lyrics, dusted with melancholy piano chords and textured beats that set it apart from the grime scene he rose up through.\n\n\"It's meant to be innovative, risky, divisive in how it's heard,\" he recently told the Standard, describing the record as a \"time capsule\" people can open in \"10 years and think: 'This is what it was like to be black in south London in 2019'\".\n\nThe critics say: \"The boldest and best British rap album in a generation.\" [The Guardian]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"A powerful and astutely crafted memoir of Dave's life and our times.\"\n\nListen to this: Black [Explicit language]\n\nFoals - Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost\n\n\"The ultimate Foals album,\" declared one critic upon hearing Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost - the first of two albums due from Foals this year.\n\nRecorded after the departure of founding member and bass player Walter Gervers, the record fuses the band's early, inscrutable math-rock with the pulverising riffs of 2015's What Went Down and the hyperspace rhythms of Holy Fire, while adding a few new flavours for good measure.\n\nThe title comes from a video game screen warning players to save their progress, which frontman Yannis Philippakis applies here to the combined effects of political and environmental chaos.\n\nThe critics say: \"This is Foals at their best, and we're only seeing half of the picture.\" [Drowned In Sound]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"A musical soundtrack to the drama of climate change.\"\n\nListen to this: Exits\n\nFontaines DC - Dogrel\n\nA year ago, Fontaines DC were playing in pubs - but the break-neck buzz of singles like Liberty Belle and Hurricane Laughter quickly saw them outgrow those stages.\n\nBoth are present on the Dublin band's debut album, a scrappy riff on their record collection (The Stooges, The Strokes, Joy Division) fused with the caustic romanticism of Shane MacGowan.\n\n\"We looked around at Dublin, saw what was happening on the streets, opened our ears, and turned it into some music,\" said bassist Conor Deegan.\n\nThe critics say: \"A fiery album which grabs you by the scruff of your neck from the start.\" [The 405]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Smartly written, impatiently driven. Irresistible reflections on urban change and loss.\"\n\nListen to this: Boys In The Better Land\n\nIdles - Joy As An Act Of Resistance\n\nAnti-Brexit, pro-immigration and determined to topple toxic masculinity, Idles' second album pulls off the tricky feat of being compassionate and angry at the same time.\n\nOver thundering riffs and bovver-boy drum beats, singer Joe Talbot tears into Britain's societal ills, while never losing his sense of humour. \"You look like a walking thyroid,\" he cajoles an assailant on Never Fight a Man With a Perm. \"You're not a man you're a gland.\"\n\nThe critics say: \"This is the jarring sound of sensitivity in a new age of chaos.\" [The Line Of Best Fit]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Everything the title promises. A bruising, uplifting guitar-charged defiance of austerity and hatred.\"\n\nListen to this: Danny Nedelko\n\nLittle Simz - Grey Area\n\n\"I'm Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days,\" raps Little Simz on Offence, the strutting funk workout that opens her third album.\n\nIt's tongue-in-cheek, but there's a sliver of truth: 25-year-old Simbi Ajikawo has emerged as one of the UK's most agile wordsmiths and she reaches new heights here by confronting the demons that lurk below that self-belief.\n\nUnusually for a British rap record, it's recorded with a live band, taking in everything from jazz and soul to punk and chiptune.\n\nThe critics say: \"A wickedly assured, highly entertaining, coming-of-age marvel.\" [Pitchfork]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Rap as self-reflection, vulnerability as power. Poignant and implacable.\"\n\nListen to this: Offence [Explicit language]\n\nNao - Saturn\n\nIn astrology, Saturn's Return is the theory that you undergo life-changing events every 29 years, when Saturn returns to the same position it occupied when you were born.\n\nFor London singer-songwriter Nao, those changes involved a \"complete shedding of skin\" as she endured a painful break-up and questioned her career choices.\n\nThankfully, she chose to stick with music - escaping sorrow's gravitational pull with an other-worldly album of neo-soul.\n\nThe critics say: \"Saturn's sonic palette and millennial anxieties are both strikingly modern, a testament to Nao's perceptiveness as a songwriter.\" [Loud and Quiet]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Beautifully crafted songs and buoyant vocals. An impeccable soul album.\"\n\nListen to this: Make It Out Alive\n\nSeed Ensemble - Driftglass\n\nFormed in 2016, Seed Ensemble is a 10-piece project led by saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, who mix old and new beats with spiritual, Afro-centric jazz.\n\nBut it's a London album through and through. On the rootsy Afronaut, poetess Xana evokes London tower blocks and \"growing up on Desmonds\"; while WAKE is an acid-tongued tribute to the 72 victims of the Grenfell fire, opening with the lyrics: \"Tell all my mourners to mourn in red, 'cause there ain't no sense in my bein' dead\".\n\nThe critics say: \"A powerfully coherent document of an important strand of UK contemporary jazz that's also a lot of fun to listen to.\" [Jazz Views]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Rousing and inspiring.\"\n\nListen to this:Afronaut\n\nslowthai - Nothing Great About Britain\n\nNothing Great About Britain may not be an easy listen, but it is a compelling one - giving a voice to disillusioned provincial Britain, while firing shots at the monarchy, the police and the far right.\n\nIt's all the work of 24-year-old Tyron Frampton (slowthai was a school nickname), whose music is rooted in the sounds of grime and the attitude of punk.\n\nBut while the title track and the Skepta-featuring Inglorious paint a bleak picture of modern Britain, Frampton retains a reassuring faith in the communal power of music.\n\n\"I feel like as long as I bring people together, and we all have a love for life and a love for ourselves, I feel like that's what it's all about,\" he recently told Billboard.\n\nThe critics say: \"A measured yet viciously ribald meditation on the contradictions at the heart of Britishness in 2019.\" [The Quietus]\n\nMercury Prize judges say: \"Absorbing, vivid stories of lives lived at the cultural margins, told with tenderness, rage and humour.\"\n\nListen to this: Inglorious [Explicit language]\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
