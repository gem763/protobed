But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic from 2021.\n\nIn the backstop's place would be 'two borders':\n\nNorthern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nThe final draft deal today appeared to resolve the DUP's fears over customs - but crucially, not consent.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster had blasted rumours of a customs border down the Irish Sea.\n\nToday a No10 source insisted that under the deal, \"Northern Ireland will be in the UK customs territory forever.\" The source added: \"There is now no doubt that Northern Ireland remains part of the UK\u2019s customs territory and will benefit from the free trade deals we strike.\"\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nYet Boris Johnson is now braced for a huge spat with the DUP over how future arrangements from January 2021 will be approved in Northern Ireland.\n\nToday's draft deal says the Stormont Assembly will get a vote every four years on whether to continue sharing EU rules between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nThe first vote would happen just before January 2025 - and need 60% support, including both 40% of nationalists voting and 40% of unionists voting.\n\nBut the 40% threshold stops short of the DUP's demands to have a majority of each side of the divide in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"This democratic support is a cornerstone of our newly agreed approach\". Mr Barnier said. He added crucially, unlike the Northern Ireland backstop, it was not a temporary measure.\n\nAnother sticking point with the DUP was thought to be a row about whether EU VAT rates would apply in Northern Ireland.\n\nCurrently there is a system where firms pay domestic VAT in the same way as VAT on imports or exports between EU states. This would leave questions about how firms in Ireland and Northern Ireland are charged.\n\nFinally the DUP fear plans to consult the Stormont Assembly over any future deal could leave them without a veto. They are thought to want a double lock where both nationalists and unionists would have to approve a deal.\n\n(Image: Leon Neal)\n\nDUP chiefs had three face to face meetings with the Prime Minister in quick succession in a desperate bid to overcome the hurdles.\n\nBut at 6.45am today Ms Foster and DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said: \u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\"\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"From what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected.\n\n\u201cThese proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.\n\n\u201cThis sell out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker struck the agreement three hours before a meeting of 28 EU leaders - but the DUP still aren't on board", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Nicola Bartlett", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Julien Warnand Epa-Efe Rex", "Anadolu Agency Via Getty Images", "Afp Getty Images", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Leon Neal"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-PROD-MAIN-Brexit_4905JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
