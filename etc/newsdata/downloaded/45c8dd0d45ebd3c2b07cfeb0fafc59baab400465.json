I think we've got a solid car.\n\n\"We're hopefully going to be able to give them a fight but they're very quick on the straights.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Ferrari's turnaround in performance and one-two in Japanese Grand Prix qualifying came \"out of nowhere\", admitted Mercedes Formula 1 team boss Toto Wolff", "authors": ["Scott Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_Kq3PP355c9yPepqURwXRw--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/0ed27c91a70d454647be55bc55ae28b2", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
