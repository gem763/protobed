This would mean household electric bills would go up by 43% cumulatively over the next decade on average \u2013 more in countries that still rely heavily on coal in electricity generation, less elsewhere. Gasoline would cost 14% more on average.\u201d\n\nCalculations by the IMF\u2019s economists show that a $75-a-ton carbon tax would also lead \u2013 once inflation has been taken into account \u2013 to an average 214% increase in the cost of coal and a 68% increase in natural gas. For the UK, the increases would be 157% for coal, 51% for natural gas, 43% for electricity and 8% for petrol.\n\nDetails of the IMF\u2019s call for a much higher carbon tax came in a chapter from the organisation\u2019s biannual fiscal monitor released before its publication next week.\n\n\u201cWithout substantial mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures are projected to rise by around 4C above preindustrial levels by 2100 (they have already increased by 1C since 1900),\u201d the IMF said.\n\n\u201cGlobal warming causes major damage to the global economy and the natural world and engenders risk of catastrophic and irreversible outcomes such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events (already more frequent) leading to loss of life and the possibility of much higher warming scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe IMF said it was calling for a substantially higher carbon tax because the carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounted for almost two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions and was the most immediately practical to control.\n\nBut the authors of the fiscal monitor said that without compensation to offset the impact on business and consumers, there was likely to be strong political resistance. The French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s attempt to cut France\u2019s CO2 emissions through higher fuel prices prompted nationwide protests from the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement.\n\nA blog post by the authors to accompany the chapter from the fiscal monitor said global heating was a clear and present threat. Actions to date had fallen short of what was required, and finance ministers needed to play a pivotal role in dealing with the problem.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cA better future is possible. Governments will need to increase the price of carbon emissions to give people and firms incentives to reduce energy use and shift to clean energy sources. Carbon taxes are the most powerful and efficient tools, but only if they are implemented in a fair and growth-friendly way.\n\n\u201cTo make carbon taxes politically feasible and economically efficient, governments need to choose how to use the new revenue. Options include cutting other kinds of taxes, supporting vulnerable households and communities, increasing investment in green energy or simply returning the money to people as a dividend.\u201d\n\nThe IMF economists said governments could target financial help directly at workers and communities disproportionately affected by the carbon tax instead of paying a flat-rate dividend to everybody. Restricting compensation to the poorest 40% of households would leave three-quarters of the revenue from the carbon tax for investment in green energy, innovation or to fund the UN\u2019s anti-poverty 2030 sustainable development goals.\n\nWhile about 50 countries currently have a carbon pricing scheme in some form, the IMF said the global average carbon price of $2 a ton was far below what the planet needed. It said other countries could learn from Sweden, which has a carbon tax of $127 per ton and has managed to reduce emissions 25% since 1995, while the economy has expanded by 75%.", "description": "Fund says governments could use money to help vulnerable people or invest in green energy", "authors": ["Larry Elliott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62027109747fe27976f15d86345b5b3fb2342214/0_209_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a61a28c557a1d4db1c8193db9439e68", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
