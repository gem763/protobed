We're trying to be everything to everyone \u2014 saying too many things in a fragmented way. And it shows. We're a Fortune #17 company that doesn't break the top 100 in brand value ranking.\"\n\nThe nation's largest traditional grocer appears to be rebranding as it faces heightened competition from rivals including Walmart, Amazon-owned Whole Foods, discount grocers Aldi and Lidl, and dollar stores. Walmart and Whole Foods are rapidly growing their online grocery services, while discount and dollar stores are driving down prices.\n\nKroger's memo concedes that the company is losing to some of those competitors when it comes to branding.\n\n\"Core equities that drive strong grocery brands, including quality, freshness, making life easier and saving money, are now what our competitors are known for,\" the memo states.\n\nSo what's next for Kroger?\n\nThe company provided a few details about its new brand, saying it \"takes a clear stand that fresh shouldn't just be for some, it should be for all,\" and that it \"has a standout look that is instantly identifiable and ownable and will linger in the hearts and minds of our customers.\"\n\nKroger expects the new brand to\"drive repeat trips and very firmly solidify our leadership position in the industry,\" the memo states.\n\nKroger is the largest traditional grocer in the US with more than 2,700 stores and roughly 450,00 employees.\n\nThe company recently executed a store-management restructuring that involved hundreds of firings, demotions, and transfers.\n\n\"Like many industries, grocery retail is navigating through disruptive change,\" a Kroger representative previously told Business Insider, regarding the layoffs. \"These are not easy decisions, but we do believe they are necessary to ensure the Kroger family of companies can continue to deliver fresh, affordable food for customers, jobs with good benefits and growth opportunities, and our commitment to ending hunger in our communities.\"\n\nKroger made the staffing changes after announcing last month that it wouldn't hit its three-year target of $400 million in incremental operating profit as part of the transformation plan that it calls \"Restock Kroger.\"\n\nAt the same time, Kroger announced improvements in other metrics. In the most recent quarter, same-store sales grew 2.2% excluding fuel, compared with a 1.6% gain in the previous year, and digital sales grew 31% year-over-year.\n\nGot a tip?
