The two are about to embark on a \"Little Weirds\" book tour together.\n\n\"I like to be in conversation with the person I love the most at the end of a performance of pieces that I wrote in order to get myself back together,\" says Slate about touring with Shattuck. \"I like that our relationship feels like one of the many happy results from a lot of hard personal work.\"\n\nShattuck actually makes an inadvertent appearance in \u201cLittle Weirds,\u201d in a piece of the book Slate wrote about a trip to Norway with friends well before the two started dating. It's an entry that shows romantic connection obvious to a reader \u2013 so obvious that I guessed it was about Shattuck \u2013 but maybe not to Slate, herself.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the first pieces I wrote for the book, and I definitely didn't think I would see him again. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have written it,\u201d says Slate, who doesn\u2019t explicitly name Shattuck in the section where she meets a \u201cdark-haired stranger\u201d who paints her a picture of a blue flower and recites her verses from a poem in a dream.\n\nJenny Slate's book \"Little Weirds\" is available Nov. 5 (Photo: Little Brown)\n\n\u201cIt happens to truly, strangely be true that my fianc\u00e9 is that man!\u201d Slate confirms.\n\nThe two didn\u2019t get together until after Slate was on deadline to complete \"Little Weirds\" a year ago, and she wanted to get Shattuck\u2019s permission to use part of an email she had sent him about his birthday, for her book.\n\nIn retrospect, Slate can see how her then-platonic emails, which were \u201cletters about the earth,\u201d were signs of an intense connection with Shattuck.\n\n\u201cI remember writing to Ben, and when I wrote to him I was really clear in my mind. He made my mind bloom in its best season,\u201d she lovingly recalls.\n\nEventually, months after trading poetic, earthy messages, Slate reached back out and invited Shattuck to visit. Then, she visited him. \u201cAnd, um, I basically just like kinda never left,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just fell in love.\u201d\n\nMore: 'A moment of magic': Andr\u00e9 Aciman talks 'Call Me by Your Name' sequel, 'Find Me'\n\nShattuck isn\u2019t the only male who's referenced but never named in \"Little Weirds.\" Slate\u2019s dog is also in the book, but never called Reggie.\n\nSlate\u2019s A-list ex Chris Evans, whom she dated on and off in 2018, isn\u2019t mentioned.\n\n\u201cI think I'm the only name that should really be in there,\u201d says Slate. \u201cThis is my story and I think I'm very careful.\n\n\"Now, I say Ben's name because, you know, he'll be my husband and he's in my life and he is okay with that. But I am very tired of my own name being tied to other people, especially men that aren't making my work,\u201d she says.\n\nEx-husband Dean Fleischer-Camp, with whom Slate co-created \u201cMarcel the Shell,\u201d does get a quick thank you in the acknowledgments at the end of the book, because \u201cwe still work together and he's a very close creative partner.\" But it took a while for Slate to be ready to talk about her relationship with Fleischer-Camp, in her writing and comedy, at all.\n\nJenny Slate on why she doesn't name any names in her book: \"I think I'm the only name that should really be in there. This is my story and I\u2019m think I'm very careful. Now, I say Ben's name because, you know, he'll be my husband and he's in my life and he is okay with that. But I am very tired of my own name being tied to other people, especially men that aren't making my work.\" (Photo: TARA ZIEMBA, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI think once I felt like I was able to speak about it in a way that felt specific and concise and not hurtful for either either me or Dean, I felt that as long as I can make it really, really about me and about my specific feeling in my life as a person alone, I can do this,\u201d says Slate.\n\nShe likens being ready to talk about her divorce, to being a trainer so comfortable with a reptile, that she can \"go on TV and hold snakes.\"\n\nToday, Slate is confident that \"I know how to hold this wild thing.\"\n\nAnd she knows how to write about it, in a language that she describes best: Her writing is \"like watching a flower bloom in fast-forward on 'Sesame Street.'\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/28/jenny-slate-little-weirds-book-netflix/2451357001/", "description": "Jenny Slate on her book that doesn't name men: \"I am very tired of my own name being tied to other people, especially men that aren't making my work.\"", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "John Grisham", "Elton John", "Ronan Farrow", "Hoda Kotb", "Delia Owens", "Published A.M.
