They believed she had driven on the wrong side of the road for 400 metres after leaving the base.\n\nAnne Sacoolas.\n\nThe Foreign Office insisted her husband, Jonathan Sacoolas, had full diplomatic immunity under the Vienna convention, even though his name was not included in the US diplomatic list, according to an expert in diplomatic law.\n\nUK diplomats said that list was a far from exhaustive register of those capable of claiming full diplomatic immunity, and the RAF Croughton base where Jonathan Sacoolas had worked was treated as an annex of the US embassy.\n\nBoris Johnson has said Sacoolas should face justice in the UK, saying: \u201cI do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has promised to raise the issue with Donald Trump if Raab, was unable to make progress in persuading US officials to make Sacoolas return to the UK to face police. Raab raised the case with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Monday night.\n\nQ&A How does diplomatic immunity work? Show Hide Diplomatic immunity is the protection given under international and UK law to foreign diplomats and their families. It was formalised through the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (VCDR). Reciprocal global agreements also protect UK diplomats working abroad. Without a foreign state agreeing to lift immunity, diplomats and their dependent families can only be detained \u201cas a last resort\u201d if, for example, they are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves. The only other sanction available to the Foreign Office would be to order their expulsion. When a foreign state agrees to remove that legal protection, it is known as a \u201cwaiver of immunity\u201d. Individual diplomats cannot do so; the embassy of the foreign state has to make a formal request. As well as covering diplomats and their families anywhere in the UK, the same convention and legislation prevents UK officials from entering diplomatic premises. That inviolability enabled Julian Assange to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years. Owen Bowcott, Legal affairs correspondent\n\nBut Mark Stephens, an acknowledged legal expert on diplomatic immunity law, challenged whether Jonathan Sacoolas enjoyed full immunity under the Vienna convention, saying he had not been registered as such with the Foreign Office.\n\nHe suggested Sacoolas and his dependents instead only had more limited immunity under the Visiting Forces Act, and its derivative bilateral orders that provide immunity to personnel on specific UK bases. That immunity, according to Crown Prosecution Service guidance, is restricted to specific offences that \u201carose out of and in the course of the service person\u2019s duties as a member of the visiting force including whether the act occurred in the course of the individual\u2019s professional duties\u201d.\n\nThe US air force has in the past, according to the CPS, interpreted professional duties to include driving from an air base to a home address. The Sacoolas family was reportedly living on the base, which would mean they could not claim that defence.\n\nOffering to speak to the grieving family, Stephens said: \u201cThe bilateral treaty doesn\u2019t bind Northamptonshire police and it does not bind the family of this poor boy who was deceased, and as a consequence of that they can apply for her extradition to come back to face manslaughter charges.\u201d\n\nHe said the family had a right to sue Anne Sacoolas outside the UK jurisdiction and suggested the US had tried to get the intelligence officer out of the country to keep his identity secret, a tactic that had backfired: \u201cIf she had gone to court in the UK, probably no one would have known about him.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Charles, Dunn\u2019s mother, insisted in interviews broadcast on Tuesday that the family would not cease its efforts to seek justice for her son, including changes to the way in which diplomatic immunity was interpreted in the UK. She said they were raising funds to take their case to the US.\n\nPlay Video 0:58 Harry Dunn's parents call for diplomat's wife to face justice over son's death \u2013 video\n\nCharles said: \u201cWe are hoping that with Boris [Johnson] now clearly on his side and saying that he also feels it is not right, we are very much hoping that over the next couple of days things will improve for us and it will help our fight to get some justice done.\n\n\u201cAnd also we are hoping that it will help change this for the future. We are doing this because Harry would want to fight for what he believed in. And we need to fight for change.\n\n\u201cIt is going to take quite a long time to come to terms. The part that I struggle to understand [is] why she took the decision to leave, why she felt it was the right thing to go.\u201d\n\nCharles said that understanding would only come when \u201cwe have a chance to meet her and for her to talk about it, see her remorse\u201d.\n\nThe motorcyclist\u2019s father, Tim Dunn, said: \u201cShe knew Harry had died, she had been told that, and what I really struggle to understand is if you knew that you have killed somebody, you think it is the right thing to flee the country.\u201d\n\nThe US state department\u2019s own guidelines for law enforcement officials make it clear that the US does not believe diplomatic immunity extends to foreign diplomats committing serious or repeat driving offences in the US, either while under the influence of alcohol or not.\n\nSacoolas, who reportedly had her 12-year-old son in the car when the crash happened, was spoken to by police the day after the crash and initially said she had no plans to leave the UK.\n\nPolice officers became aware immunity was an issue because her husband was a diplomat and applied to the US embassy for a waiver to allow them to question her. But they were later informed the waiver had been refused and Sacoolas had left the country.", "description": "Legal experts question if American is eligible for full immunity over alleged role in fatal crash", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fc39dd372978c5a27bb937e7b9d724c62565a4c/0_245_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2de06c4623a32333fec4ff1973feba56", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
