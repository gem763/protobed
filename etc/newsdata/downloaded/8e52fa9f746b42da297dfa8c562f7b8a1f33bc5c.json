Music rights holders are concerned the setup will see them making less money. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: Apple\u2019s subscription plan would bring together services with different revenue and growth strategies. The company priced TV Plus at US$4.99 a month, compared to US$8.99 for Netflix\u2019s lowest tier, in order to build audience.
