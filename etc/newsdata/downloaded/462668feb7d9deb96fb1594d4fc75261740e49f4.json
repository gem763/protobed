A key U.S. factory gauge fell below 50 for the first time since 2016, adding to concern the world\u2019s largest economy may be headed for a recession. Trump tweeted that China will have a much tougher time securing a trade deal if the Asian nation waits until he wins the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nCrude has fallen around 18% from a high in late April as the trade war escalated and the toll it\u2019s taking on the global economy became more apparent. While the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries has pushed ahead with a program to limit output, supply from the group increased last month and American production kept rising.\n\n\u201cThe potential for a slowdown in demand is likely to keep weighing on the market,\u201d said Sungchil Will Yun, a commodities analyst at HI Investment & Futures Corp. in Seoul. \u201cThe U.S. manufacturing report was disappointing, and added to the downward price pressure.\u201d\n\nWTI for October delivery rose 29 cents, or 0.5%, to $54.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 9:56 a.m. in Singapore. The contract declined $1.16 over the previous two days. There was no settlement price on Monday due to the Labor Day holiday in the U.S.\n\nfor November settlement added 23 cents, or 0.4%, to $58.49 a barrel on the ICE (NYSE: ) Futures Europe Exchange. The contract lost 0.7% on Tuesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a $4.44 premium to WTI for the same month.", "description": "Oil Holds Loss After Trump Tweet Adds to Trade War Pessimism", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2068f5c3c4d1fff28d12e8406ac875e6.jpg"}
