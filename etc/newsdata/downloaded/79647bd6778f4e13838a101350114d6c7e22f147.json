Those experiences influenced her desire to provide affordable education and classroom lessons to children.\n\nShe went to school to become a behavioral learning specialist but stopped working in the public school system because she found it hard to teach full time and have a family. Feriante told ABC News that she is focusing on Redwood Grow and more partnerships within schools around Chicago.\n\nKaitlin Feriante\n\nFeriante, now a mother of three, told ABC News that \"it feels hopeful and encouraging\" when seeing the results and growth of the children who are at Redwood.\n\nSophie Galeener, 8, a third-grader at Grace Lutheran Church and School in River Forest, Illinois, has dyslexia. She attended Redwood's summer program and then attended Redwood Day for a school year.\n\nMegan Galeener, Sophie's mother, said that school year and program improved her daughter's reading skills and that they changed their lives.\n\n\"For the first time, someone understood what we were going through and what our daughter needed,\" Galeener told ABC News. \"They taught her how to read.\"\n\nBeginning its second year of services, the future seems bright for Redwood Literacy, Feriante said.\n\n\"We hope to have multiple affordable after-school centers around the city, especially in or near neighborhoods that are under-resourced. We are planning on opening a second Redwood Literacy location in summer 2020,\" she said.", "description": "Kaitlin Feriante started Redwood Literacy more than a year ago; it's expanded into three programs seeking to help Chicago children with learning disabilities.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/chicago-literacy-auset-ht-jt-190913_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
