After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged,\u201d Smith, known for his critical coverage of President Donald Trump and his administration, said in a statement. \u201cThe opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor. I\u2019ve worked with the most talented, dedicated and focused professionals I know and I\u2019m proud to have anchored their work each day \u2014 I will deeply miss them.\u201d\n\nHired by Fox News in 1996, Smith covered breaking news stories for the network for over 20 years.\n\nFox News president and executive editor, Jay Wallace, said the anchor will leave his post as chief news anchor and managing editor of the outlet\u2019s breaking news department.\n\n\u201cShep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry. His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery,\u201d Wallace said in a statement. \u201cWe are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at FOX News, along with everything he accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure. While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.\u201d\n\n\u201cShep Smith has been there from the beginning and was the most talented breaking news anchor I ever saw. Fox News Channel will not be the same without him,\u201d Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said of the news.\n\nBefore joining Fox News, Smith was a Fox News Edge correspondent based in Los Angeles.\n\nSmith\u2019s departure comes as President Trump has ratcheted up his criticisms of Fox News. Just yesterday, the president ripped into the anchor as part of his criticism prompted by the news network\u2019s poll that shows a record 51% of voters say they want him impeached and removed from office.\n\n\u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be,\u201d the president tweeted.\n\n\u2026Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nSmith earned mockery from fellow Fox News host Tucker Carlson last month for defending Fox News legal analyst Andrew Napolitano\u2019s opinion that President Trump broke the law during his July 25th telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nWatch Smith\u2019s final sign-off below:", "description": "Longtime Fox News Channel anchor Shepard Smith on Friday announced on his weekday program that he is leaving the news network.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_18250443880035-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
