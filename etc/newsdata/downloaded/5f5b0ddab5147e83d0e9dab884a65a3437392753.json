(Gene J. Puskar)\n\nWhen Eli Manning was benched this week by the New York Giants and Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s 16th season with the Pittsburgh Steelers was cut short by an elbow injury amid the leaguewide quarterback carnage, it was almost impossible not to flash back to that spring day in 2004, which began with the Giants coveting Manning but unsure if they\u2019d be able to land him, and Roethlisberger riding to Madison Square Garden wondering if he might end up playing in New York.\n\nThat memorable NFL draft turned out to be every bit as consequential for the league\u2019s balance of power over the ensuing 15 years as seemed possible on April 24, 2004. The Giants made their draft-day trade for Manning after the Chargers, then based in San Diego, took Manning first overall. Philip Rivers ended up with the Chargers and Roethlisberger, passed up by the Giants at No. 4 in favor of Rivers and the pending blockbuster trade, went 11th to the Steelers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little happier now than I was 10 minutes ago,\u201d Manning said that day, having told the Chargers that he didn\u2019t want to play for them. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect a trade to happen. Obviously this is news to me, and it\u2019s good news.\u201d\n\nThat is four Super Bowl triumphs, two by Manning with the Giants and two by Roethlisberger with the Steelers, ago. Manning, Roethlisberger and Rivers have remained with their original NFL teams, with Rivers accompanying the Chargers to Los Angeles. Each is having, arguably, a Hall of Fame career.\n\nBut the early stages of this 2019 season have not been kind to NFL quarterbacks, and Manning and Roethlisberger became part of the attrition. Roethlisberger exited the Steelers\u2019 loss last Sunday to the Seattle Seahawks, which dropped their record to 0-2, after grabbing at his elbow following a throw. He was replaced by Mason Rudolph, and the Steelers announced Monday that Roethlisberger needed season-ending surgery. A day later, Manning was told by Coach Pat Shurmur, with the Giants at 0-2, that he was losing his starting job to rookie Daniel Jones, taken sixth overall in this year\u2019s draft.\n\n[The NFL's great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive]\n\nThey joined a list of shelved prominent NFL quarterbacks that includes the New Orleans Saints\u2019 Drew Brees and the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 Nick Foles, both injured, and the New York Jets\u2019 Sam Darnold, diagnosed with mononucleosis. Andrew Luck retired from the Indianapolis Colts just before the season. Cam Newton\u2019s playing status is unclear after he aggravated a foot injury in the Carolina Panthers\u2019 second game. It is dismaying to a sport that increasingly has built its appeal around keeping its star quarterbacks healthy and historically productive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say, \u2018Next man up,\u2019 but this is ridiculous,\u201d former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann said by phone this week. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nWhat could have been\n\nManning, in consultation with his family and representatives, told the Chargers leading up to the 2004 draft that he wouldn\u2019t play in San Diego. Ernie Accorsi, then the general manager of the Giants, considered Manning a once-in-a-generation talent. A.J. Smith, then the GM of the Chargers, liked Rivers but held off on a trade until after drafting Manning.\n\nOn the day before the draft, a Roethlisberger associate was told by the Giants that they might take Roethlisberger at No. 4 if the Chargers took Manning first and wouldn\u2019t trade him. But Leigh Steinberg, then Roethlisberger\u2019s agent, warned Roethlisberger to remain wary of that possibility.\n\nSteinberg once recalled, several years after the draft, telling Roethlisberger during the ride Saturday morning in New York to the draft to please remember that the Chargers had been locked on Rivers since the Senior Bowl scouting event, and Accorsi had been locked on Manning basically forever. The draft then was a two-day event held at what was then called The Theater at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\n\nNew York Giants quarterback Eli Manning was benched this week. (Bill Kostroun)\n\nSteinberg was right. The Chargers took Manning with the top selection, leading to the awkward scene of Manning holding a Chargers jersey and cap while posing with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important day for the NFL,\u201d Manning said that day, pre-trade. \u201cThe draft is a special time. I did not want to cause a scene. We already kind of caused one in a way, but I did not want to embarrass the commissioner.\u201d\n\nThe trade was completed soon after. Accorsi, who once had been forced as GM of the Colts to trade John Elway to Denver when the Hall of Fame quarterback-to-be refused to play in Baltimore, had his man. Rivers landed in Southern California. The Chargers also got draft picks that later would yield kicker Nate Kaeding and pass rusher Shawne Merriman.\n\nRoethlisberger headed to Pittsburgh, saying on draft day, \u201cIt shows how much of a game this is, and no one really knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next\n\nFast-forward to this week\u2019s NFL quarterbacking churn. With Manning and Roethlisberger, the sense of finality seems potentially greater. Manning told reporters Wednesday that, \u201cI\u2019m not dying and the season\u2019s not over.\u201d But he\u2019s in the final season of his Giants contract and he turns 39 in January. Even if he would want to play elsewhere, would any other NFL team want him? The Giants already have moved on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through the passing of the torch before with Johnny Unitas,\u201d Accorsi told the Giants\u2019 website this week. \u201cThis is a very difficult time for me, although I knew sooner or later it would come. Eli Manning gave me the two greatest moments of my time in the National Football League. He will always be very special to me, as will his two Super Bowl championships.\u201d\n\n[No matter what the NFL does, its officiating headaches just won\u2019t go away]\n\nRoethlisberger turns 38 in March and will be coming back from his elbow surgery. He has contemplated retirement previously. But he reiterated in a written statement this week what he\u2019d said during a training camp interview \u2014 that he intends to play out a contract with the Steelers that runs through the 2021 season.\n\n\u201cThis is such a physical sport,\u201d Roethlisberger said in training camp in Latrobe, Pa. \u201cYou also can\u2019t control your injuries, your health and things like that. Having a family, you always take that into consideration. Now that I signed a new deal, I\u2019m going to be out here and honor that contract.\u201d\n\nBut Roethlisberger\u2019s future, and the consideration of his and Manning\u2019s Hall of Fame credentials, are for another day. For now, Jones and Rudolph are joined as newly installed NFL starters by the Colts\u2019 Jacoby Brissett, the Jaguars\u2019 Gardner Minshew, the Jets\u2019 Luke Falk, the Saints\u2019 Teddy Bridgewater or Taysom Hill, the Miami Dolphins\u2019 Josh Rosen (for the benched Ryan Fitzpatrick) and possibly the Panthers\u2019 Kyle Allen. The league marches on.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the NFL,\u201d Theismann said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the weather: Stay tuned. It\u2019ll change soon.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 3: Bears, 49ers and Chiefs roll on\n\nBrewer: NFL rookie deals are the worst in sports, and some young stars have had enough\n\nNFL power rankings Week 3: Cowboys, Ravens move up as others suffer QB unrest", "description": "Manning and Roethlisberger were part of the NFL\u2019s QB turnover this week, more than 15 years after they and Philip Rivers made for an intriguing draft day.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Am", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
