Patton already donated $5,600 to Buttigieg in June\u2014a donation that the South Bend mayor\u2019s campaign said it would be returning.\n\n\u201cTransparency and justice for Laquan McDonald is more important than a campaign contribution,\u201d Chris Meagher, the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s national press secretary, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe are returning the money he contributed to the campaign and the money he has collected. He is no longer a co-host for the event and will not be attending.\u201d\n\nPatton\u2019s role in the Friday fundraiser, first reported by the Associated Press, prompted sharp criticism of Buttigieg, including from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the city\u2019s most prominent civil rights leader, who called on the Democratic nominee to \u201cadjust his schedule.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign had initially declined to comment on the story, directing the Associated Press to his \u201cDouglass Plan\u201d to end systemic racism.\n\nButtigieg, who is struggling in the polls among black voters, has had difficulty trying to reconcile his sweeping proposals for deconstructing structural racism with his record as the mayor, where he fired the city\u2019s first black police chief and has conceded that he has failed in diversifying the city\u2019s law enforcement. South Bend\u2019s police department is 90 percent white while the city itself is 27 percent black.\n\nIn June, Buttigieg left the campaign trail following the shooting death of a black man, Eric Logan, by a white police officer. At a town hall discussing the shooting, Buttigieg was heckled by angry South Bend residents who demanded that he focus on the city\u2019s problems with racism in its police force rather than his run for the White House.\n\n\u201cI just want you to know that we\u2019re not running from this,\u201d Buttigieg said at the time. \u201cOf course I\u2019m upset. A man died in this city at the hands of one of the people in charge of protecting the city.\u201d\n\nOther president campaigns were quick to jump on Patton\u2019s participation in the fundraiser as evidence of misplaced priorities. Rob Flaherty, digital director for Buttigieg rival Beto O\u2019Rourke, tweeted that it was \u201cgood to see that despite The Pete Pivot, he\u2019s remaining consistent on some things.\u201d\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission filings, Patton donated $2,700 to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 campaign for the U.S. Senate.", "description": "The South Bend mayor had been scheduled to attend an event co-hosted by\u00a0 a former Chicago city attorney who withheld the video of the McDonald shooting.
