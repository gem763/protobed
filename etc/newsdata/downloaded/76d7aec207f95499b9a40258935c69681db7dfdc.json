We\u2019re back and we are ready for it all over again.'\n\nThe Labour leader is known to enjoy campaigning more than the machinations of Westminster politics.\n\nIn the short clip, posted to his 260,000 Instagram followers, he gave a thumbs up to the camera, saying: 'We\u2019re back and we are ready for it all over again'\n\nThe Labour leader and his top team were earlier branded 'f***ing mad' by one of his own backbenchers after he agreed to a December vote, saying he would be 'going out there to win'.\n\nHe will order his party to back a rushed plan for a vote on or near December 9 later today, less than 24 hours after he told them to abstain on plans for a December 12 election.\n\nIt puts him on a collision path with backbenchers who see the party languishing in the polls and fear that he is leading them to a disaster.\n\nThe Labour leader, 70, was filmed walking down some stairs close to his parliamentary office after he risked a back-bench rebellion by agreeing to a December vote\n\nBut he showed no sign of caring as he moved briskly past the camera, smartly dressed and a blue suit and Labour-red tie.\n\nThe MP told MailOnline: 'They are f***ing mad. They think they are on the brink of a brave new Socialist dawn.'\n\nThey added that the decision was 'proof that turkeys vote for Christmas' and there would be a \u2018huge\u2019 revolt, adding: \u2018It just gets Johnson completely off the hook.\u2019\n\nDespite him agreeing to whip in favour of the Early Parliamentary General Election Bill this afternoon many are expected to vote against it - but look unlikely to stop it becoming law.\n\nMr Corbyn told his shadow cabinet this morning Labour would launch the 'most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen' now a No Deal Brexit was 'off the table'.\n\nBut critic Neil Coyle, who backs a second referendum, said: 'Today could be crucial. We have limited chances to get a People's Vote but anyone backing an election will prevent it, as well as allowing Johnson to bring back No Deal.\n\n'I know where I stand and am disgusted at those putting party politics before the national interest.'\n\nDurham North MP Kevan Jones said he would not vote for an election, saying he wanted the chance to vote on Boris Johnson's Withdrawal Agreement Bill.", "description": "The Labour leader, 70, was filmed jubilantly walking down some stairs close to his parliamentary office after he risked a back-bench rebellion by agreeing to a December vote.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/14/20328442-0-image-a-9_1572358518588.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
