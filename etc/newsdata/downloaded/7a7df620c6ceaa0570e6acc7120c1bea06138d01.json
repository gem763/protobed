The co-host of the popular New York radio show, \"The Breakfast Club,\" Charlemagne has already scalped Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). He called her out for culturally appropriating the Cherokee Nation. He wasn\u2019t going to let it go either. He kept on her and did the job that the wider media should have been doing since 2012. The most damning portion is when he said that Warren was the original Rachel Dolezal.\n\nWith South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Charlemange was no different, pressing the 2020 candidate on if he thinks the reason he\u2019s dropping in the polls is due to him sucking at the recent string of Democratic debates (via Mediaite):\n\nThe radio host grilled the South Bend mayor \u2014 though notably in an amiable manner \u2014 over whether his campaign is \u201closing momentum\u201d based on static or flagging polls. The consistently optimistic and unflappable 37 year-old candidate refused to agree with that assessment instead focusing on the progress he is making that may not yet be showing up in the polls. Charlemagne persisted, asking Mayor Pete if he thought he \u201csucked\u201d in the first debates. Mayor Pete responded with a laugh, saying no, he did not think that before explaining the odd nature of the debate formats and how he found that particularly challenging.\n\nI mean, with Marianne Williamson shooting ICBMs of love everywhere, I guess I could see that, or it could be that the 2020 field is a total clown show with not a single person who can beat Trump. They all say the same thing. Mayor Pete hasn\u2019t distinguished himself from the rest of the field. And if the Democrats\u2019 top quality for their candidate should be someone who can beat Trump, Mayor Pete of South Bend isn\u2019t it.", "description": ".09/09/2019 19:12:52PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/211/20f05fd6-fa97-4271-9eec-934f4e88f5eb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
