The Huskers had gotten off to a somewhat slow start, especially against the titans of the college football world. The Friday afternoon commitment of Rodney Groce means the Cornhuskers have nabbed two high-value targets in the last week.\n\nThis despite the fact that both Groce and Teddy Prochazka were official visitors for the Ohio State game.\n\nWhile they watched the Nebraska football team get dismantled by the bigger, faster and stronger Buckeyes, the two top prospects apparently saw a program they could help immensely. They're not wrong.\n\nNebraska football comes out of nowhere for the steal\n\nGetting Groce is a steal, any way you cut it for the Huskers. The inside linebacker has the kind of talent that could fill a big hole when it comes to replacing Mohamed Barry next season.\n\nHe also appears to be a steal in the near literal sense, considering the Huskers were not a team he was high on when the summer began. Back at the end of the may, the Alabama native listed his Top Eight as Oklahoma, Auburn, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi State, Georgia Tech, and UAB.\n\nYes, Nebraska football managed to not only make up significant ground in a matter of months, but they also beat out Auburn, Oklahoma and 'Bama to do it.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL\n\nYou might also notice that other than Oklahoma, there was a distinct lean towards one part of the country among his favorites. The Huskers were able to overcome that as well to secure Groce's commitment.\n\nStars not telling the story\n\nWhile the chants of \"stars don't matter\" grow tiresome quickly, it appears the axiom is true in this recruit's case. Groce is rated as a consensus 3-star prospect and is only the 527th ranked player in the country.\n\nAt the same time, he's the 22nd best ILB in his class. Despite the 6-1, 230-pound backer not being a blue-chip prospect, it appears plenty of coaching staffs are seeing something special in the player.\n\nWhen Oklahoma, Auburn, and Alabama are all offering a player, he's not exactly a diamond in the rough at that point.\n\nFalling in love with Lincoln\n\nGetting Groce to even come see the Nebraska football team last Saturday was a coup in and of itself, considering where the Huskers sat three months ago.\n\nHe told Rivals that once he got here, he knew this was where he wanted to go \"inside of 24 hours.\"\n\nFans and analysts alike are keen to talk about how getting a recruit to Memorial Stadium is always a big step in the recruiting process. Players like Groce and the excitement he felt, even during a bad night for Nebraska is exactly what they are talking about.\n\nRodney Groce's commit is the 12th for the 2020 class and the third overall since Nebraska football's season started.", "description": "The Huskers went into the heart of SEC county and managed to nab one of the best linebackers in the region", "authors": ["Zeegee Cecilio", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Oliver Vandervoort", "Touted Tackle Alex Harrison Taking His First Official Visit To Nebraska Football", "Cardinals Fan Gets Roasted After Claiming Yadier Molina Is Better Than Mike Trout", "Stanley Morgan Gets Called Up To The Cincinnati Bengals After Injury"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/4/os/b_1200x630/nebraska-football-got-a-steal-in-rodney-groce-image-via-steve-whiteflickr_2334289.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
