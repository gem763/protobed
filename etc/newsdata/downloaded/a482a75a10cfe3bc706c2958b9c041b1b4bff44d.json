Photo: CNA More\n\n\u201cThe ROC government deeply regrets and strongly condemns the Kiribati government\u2019s decision, which disregards the multifaceted assistance and sincere friendship extended by Taiwan to Kiribati over the years.\u201d\n\nNews reports, including from Radio New Zealand Pacific, had said the Kiribati government may announce the switch on Friday. The radio station quoted the opposition Boutokan te Koaua (BTK) Party as saying that at least one Kiribati government minister had confirmed the tiny Pacific island nation would switch ties to Beijing.\n\n\u201cBTK is sad to say that the government has not lived up to the promise it made to the people of Kiribati to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan,\u201d the party was quoted as saying by the Pacific Island News Association. \u201cAs a democratic country, BTK is shocked to learn that the government is rushing this change.\u201d\n\nExplained: how Taiwan\u2019s Pacific allies are being wooed by mainland China\n\nBeijing views Taiwan as a renegade province that must one day be united with mainland China, by force if necessary. Since the election of Tsai Ing-wen, of the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, as the self-ruled island\u2019s president in 2016, Beijing has increased its pressure on Taipei, lobbying its diplomatic allies to switch allegiance and stepping up military drills.\n\nThe split with Kiribati came four days after Beijing warned Taipei it would lose all of its diplomatic allies if Tsai were re-elected as president next year.\n\n\u201cAs long as the DPP is in power, sooner or later Taiwan will have zero diplomatic allies left,\u201d Communist Party mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily said on Monday. \u201cOnly by first improving cross-strait mutual trust can Taiwan open up its \u2018international space\u2019. If the Tsai administration still refuses to come to its senses, then there will only be more \u2018diplomatic crises\u2019 to come.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a meeting between US Vice-President Mike Pence and Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was cancelled after Washington said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the Solomons\u2019 switch of diplomatic ties to the Beijing government.\n\nIts decision, after 36 years of formal relations with Taiwan, left Taipei with five allies in the Pacific islands, in Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau and Tuvalu.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Central News Agency reported that the switch was part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to suppress Taiwan \u2013 including in diplomatic, military, tourism and international spheres \u2013 ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on October 1.\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nThis article Taiwan down to 15 allies as Kiribati announces switch of diplomatic ties to Beijing first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "Taiwan has terminated its relations with Kiribati after the Pacific island nation chose to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing.The latest switch, coming four days after Taipei severed diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands for the same reason, left Taiwan with just 15 allies.Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister", "authors": ["Lawrence Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AzLzBy8dwNbNB2v6MVxxYw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/72e62503c61cdd4dcf7c090982475be2", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
