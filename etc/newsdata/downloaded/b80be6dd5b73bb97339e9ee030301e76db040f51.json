The central bank is widely expected to announce a quarter percentage point interest rate rate cut when the meeting concludes Wednesday, with investors focusing on clues to policy makers\u2019 appetite for further easing in the months and year ahead.\n\nInvestors are also paying close attention to Brexit, with the leader of the U.K. opposition Labour Party on Tuesday telling fellow lawmakers he would back an early election now that the prospect of the country crashing out of the European Union without a deal has been taken off the table. Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson was set to once again ask lawmakers to approve an early election on Dec. 12.\n\n\u201cThe result of any election could be all over the map,\u201d said Brad Bechtel, currency analyst at Jefferies, in a note. \u201cA Johnson win would be a soft Brexit, a Johnson coalition also probably soft Brexit but a Corbyn win or Labor-led coalition is probably a vote for no Brexit and may even lead to a second referendum.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Otunuga said the longer-term outlook for gold will remain influenced by U.S.-China trade developments and global economic growth concerns.\n\n\u201cAlthough most remain cautiously optimistic over the two largest economies in the world signing a \u2018phase one\u2019 trade deal, there is still room for disappointment as talks have fallen apart in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cFocusing on the technical picture, gold is tracking sideways on the daily charts but the breakdown below $1500 should open a path towards $1485.\u201d\n\nIn other metals trade, December palladium PAZ19, -0.87% fell 1.1% to $1,760.40 an ounce, while January platinum PLF20, +0.28% was up less than 0.1% at $919.30 an ounce.\n\nDecember copper HGZ19, -0.04% was off 0.1% at $2.6795 a pound.", "description": "Gold edges lower Tuesday, a day after slipping back below the psychologically important level of $1,500 an ounce.", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX670_goldst_ZG_20181102071937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
