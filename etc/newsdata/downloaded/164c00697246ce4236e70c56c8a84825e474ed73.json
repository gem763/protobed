Now I get to travel the world. And spending time in the middle of America [on Blake\u2019s ranch] \u2014 that\u2019s something I didn\u2019t expect. The way we live at the ranch is really simple. There are watermelons that Blake planted and all my wildflowers. It\u2019s a nice contrast to L.A., although I do keep 20 chickens in the backyard here at home too.\u201d\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton | Harmony Gerber/Getty More\n\nStefani \u2014 who, on top of coaching The Voice, is busy performing her Las Vegas residency shows at the Zappos Theater through Nov. 2 \u2014 said she\u2019s all about balance these days.\n\n\u201cI love having projects. But I also love to be in my bed and have downtime,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to know that I don\u2019t have the guilt of being so busy that I miss out on taking my kids to school.\u201d\n\n\u201cBalance is the hardest thing, but it\u2019s also the most important \u2014 being with my family, having time with Blake where we just watch movies,\u201d she later added. \u201cIt seems like, with your career, you have to keep swimming, keep moving, or else you\u2019re going to look back and go, \u2018Shoot, it\u2019s over.\u2019 I don\u2019t like feeling like that. I want to do creative things when I want, and I want to stop chasing all the time. It\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m really enjoying being in the moment.\u201d\n\nRELATED: John Legend Teases Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani About Getting Married in New \u2018Trailer Talk\u2019", "description": "Gwen Stefani Calls Blake Shelton Relationship 'Healing'", "authors": ["Brianne Tracy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/I2F3vAz0sw.3bRHJYUqBTg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ea98b58aa9e42d3fc291c1d65efe4521", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
