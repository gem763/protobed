Voting in the USA TODAY contest starts today and runs through Wednesday.\n\nIn 20 games as a collegiate player, three-time All-American Grange rushed for 2,071 yards and amassed 31 touchdowns. In one game in 1924 against Michigan, Grange scored the first four times he touched the ball. He had a 95-yard kickoff return and rushing TDs of 67, 56 and 45 yards.\n\nButkus was a ferocious hitter who forced 10 fumbles with his 145 tackles for Big Ten champion Illinois in 1963. In 1964, the Football Coaches Association honored Butkus as the best player in the country.\n\nThis file photo from 1964 shows Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus in action against Northwestern. (Malcolm Emmons, USA TODAY Sports) (Photo: Malcolm Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nDan Jenkins of Sports Illustrated once wrote about Butkus: \"Dick Butkus is a special kind of brute whose particular talent is mashing runners into curious shapes.\"\n\nThe Elite Eight field was set when Tennessee's Peyton Manning (51%) defeated Texas running back Ricky Williams (49%) and Michigan's Charles Woodson (67%) bested Ohio State's Orlando Pace (33%).\n\nWe're down to the Elite 8 in our bracket to name the greatest college football player of all-time.\n\n\n\nWith help from the @WeAreAFCA, we made the bracket. But we need you to vote for the best.\n\n\n\nAnd our first matchup pits two former Fighting Illini stars. https://t.co/hqSibrGZ3h \u2014 USA TODAY Sports (@usatodaysports) October 7, 2019\n\nHere is the other Elite Eight matchups and schedule:\n\nThursday through Saturday\n\nWEST REGION FINAL\n\nTony Dorsett, Pittsburgh vs. Earl Campbell, Texas\n\nOct. 14-16\n\nMIDWEST REGION FINAL\n\nBarry Sanders, Oklahoma State vs. Herschel Walker, Georgia\n\nOct. 17-19\n\nSOUTH REGION FINAL\n\nCharles Woodson, Michigan vs. Peyton Manning, Tennessee", "description": "Dick Butkus and Red Grange kick off the first Elite Eight matchup in USA TODAY's quest to determine the greatest college football player of all-time.", "authors": ["Kevin Allen", "Published A.M.
