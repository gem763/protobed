After all, the last half of September was a rough couple of weeks for the press; perhaps no period in modern history has witnessed such a staggering amount of journalistic malfeasance.\n\nIt\u2019s a play more or less in three acts, a slapstick tragedy so absurdly avoidable that it borders on comedy. And it begins, as so many journalistic tragedies do, at the New York Times.\n\nApparently still bitter that the first press-led character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh failed to stop his confirmation to the highest court in the land, the Gray Lady doubled down on September 14 by teasing a book by Times writers Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly.\n\nThe article lobbed yet another accusation of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court Justice (well, sort of: Kavanaugh\u2019s friends allegedly shoved his penis in the face of an unsuspecting female). Not only did it appear that Kavanaugh was a victim as well, but the Times piece also conveniently failed to mention that the alleged female victim was never interviewed and according to her friends doesn\u2019t remember the incident.\n\nRather than apologize and pledge to do better, however, Pogrebin and Kelly instead blamed their editors and \u2026 wait for it \u2026 Fox News. Because, of course, nothing says strong, independent women like blaming a television network for your own faulty newspaper reporting.\n\nBut before the ink could dry on a libel suit, a new circus rolled into town and bumped the Kavanaugh debacle from the headlines.\n\nI\u2019m speaking, of course, about the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint, in which an anonymous official claims he has reason to believe that President Trump was attempting to enlist the help of the Ukrainian government in the upcoming American presidential election. And in which the American press committed more unforced errors than the Bad News Bears.\n\nThe blunders are too numerous for a full accounting, but some highlights include the following:\n\nInitial reports were rife with accusations that Trump made a \u201cpromise,\u201d or quid pro quo, to Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The summary of the phone call released by the White House (and compiled from notes of those familiar with the call) showed no such thing.\n\nTrump did ask Zelensky for a favor, but in regards to CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that determined the Russians were behind the hacking of the DNC\u2019s servers in 2016, not the investigation of Biden or his son, as the whistleblower claimed. To create the appearance that the favor involved the Bidens, multiple media outlets simply omitted the more than 500 words of the call summary that separated the \u201cfavor\u201d request from the Biden portion of the conversation. From NPR to CNN to MSNBC, virtually the entire mainstream media complex embraced egregiously dishonest editing to push a narrative the phone call proved simply wasn\u2019t there.\n\nOnce the story gained steam, numerous outlets jumped on a Washington Post claim that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire threatened to resign if not allowed to testify before Congress unhindered. Maguire quickly denied the reports, saying, \u201cI have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\u201d\n\nFinally, ABC reported that any phone call from Trump to Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president required a discussion of the Biden probe. Their source, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, rejected the account, telling Christopher Miller of Radio Free Europe that he was not an adviser at the time of the call and that he \u201cDID NOT tell ABC insistence for leaders to discuss Biden probe was precondition for call.\u201d\n\nThere were numerous additional snafus, but why beat a dead horse?\n\nHardly any part of this entire sordid tale went unbutchered by America\u2019s media apparatus. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs indeed, but one that is hardly surprising these days, as the press has fully embraced activism in place of objectivism.\n\nPerhaps nothing illustrates this ethical decline better than the finale of our drama, which resides outside of national politics, in the heart of middle America. In Des Moines, Iowa, to be exact, where Aaron Calvin, a reporter for the city\u2019s Register newspaper, ran a \u201croutine background check\u201d on Carson King, a 24-year-old security guard who had managed to raise more than $1 million for a local children\u2019s hospital thanks to his love of Busch Light beer.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the intrepid journalist uncovered some unsavory tweets from King\u2019s teenage years. He went on to publicly humiliate the good-willed beer drinker and force Anheuser-Busch to cut ties with King\u2019s campaign. Many were outraged at the paper\u2019s decision to so thoroughly vet a man with such good intentions, and it didn\u2019t take long for some unsavory tweets from Calvin\u2019s past to surface (the irony of the paper performing a background check on King but not a member of its own staff is hard to ignore).\n\nCalvin has since been sacked from the Register, but his editors, who made the decision to run with King\u2019s tweets, strangely kept their jobs. But before you go feeling sorry for Calvin, it\u2019s worth noting that he used the same sorry excuse as his colleagues at the New York Times, telling BuzzFeed:\n\n[T]his whole campaign was taken up by right-wing ideologues and largely driven by that force. It was just a taste of what I assume that women and journalists of color suffer all the time, but the kind of locality and regional virality of the story made it so intense.\n\nThis is journalism in 2019, folks. No matter the clarity of their crimes, the press insists they are the victims and are therefore justified in ignoring facts that get in the way of the progressive cause du jour.\n\nAnd as the 2020 election draws nearer there\u2019s little reason to believe that, despite that terrible song, the end of September will wake them up to the undeniable damage they are doing to their country.", "description": "There\u2019s a really bad song called \u201cWake Me Up When September Ends\u201d by a really bad band named Green Day.
