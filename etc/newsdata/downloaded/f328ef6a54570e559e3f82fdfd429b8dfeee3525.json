We've combined this with the leaks and rumours in the past, to get you right on track. Here's everything we know about the PlayStation 5.\n\nLetsGoDigital\n\nA revamped design language\n\nLeaks in the past have hinted the PlayStation 5 to bring completely new design cues. The boxy square-ish minimal matte design has turned more vivid and dynamic with lines, curves and ridges which make it look more edgy. LetsGoDigital shared some renders of what the PlayStation 5 could really look like. While it isn't sure that this could be the final design, it would look really cool nonetheless.\n\nRay tracing graphics\n\nWhile the CPU is expected to be based on AMD's Ryzen line and the GPU is based on the Navi family of chips. It is going to include ray tracing (like the ones on the RTX series by Nvidia). The newer graphics hardware on the PlayStation 5 will allow players to have an even smoother gaming experience at 4K resolution with higher frame rates.\n\nDon't Miss 1.8 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 916 SHARES 918 SHARES 851 SHARES\n\nSuperfast SSD\n\nOne thing really disappoints current PS4 owners is the load time in the game. With the PlayStation 5, Sony wishes to change that with the inclusion of an SSD that is expected to make loading-time woes a thing of the past. Moreover, the new console is also expected to allow users to install a game's multiplayer or single-player campaign without installing the whole game, thus to save storage space and load times, just like it was during the cartridge days!\n\nBetter controller feedback\n\nJim also mentioned that the controller on the PlayStation 5 will be getting some notable new features to make the gameplay more intuitive and engrossing. For starters, it is getting a revamped haptic feedback that will replace the rumble motors. This will allow for a more dynamic feedback that will let you feel different vibrations for different guns, dynamic vibrations during racecar revs and crashes etc. Along with this, the controllers will get USB-C for charging and connectivity.\n\nRepresentative Image: Reuters\n\nAnother upgrade in the controller is with its triggers. Sony is bringing in something called 'Adaptive triggers' for its L2 and R2 triggers. Developers will get the option to program the resistance for players -- for example, feeling tactile feedback while drawing bow and arrow, or driving a car through rocky terrain.\n\nUnveiling Holiday 2020\n\nPlayStation 5 was expected to come sometime this year, however, it looks like Sony has pushed its dates further and officially revealed that it will be launched by Holiday Season 2020, which is somewhere around November-December.\n\nAre you excited about the PlayStation 5?
