He entirely accepts the findings and the punishment. He telephoned Paul Struthers [chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association (PJA)] on the day of the test saying he would fail.\u201d\n\n\ufffd\ufffd ON THIS DAY \ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\n20th September 2008\n\n\n\nWilliam Carson steers Regal Parade to Ayr Gold Cup glory.\n\n\n\nBet his grandad was as proud as punch. pic.twitter.com/dpPsHE4UoF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 GG (@ggcouk) September 20, 2019\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Jenny Pitman, the former trainer and a member of the three-person panel, spoke to the jockey about drug use.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cShe spoke sensitively, kindly and thoughtfully to William about drugs,\u201d added MacNeice. \u201cThat is how William accepted the message and I would encourage panel members, when appropriate, to give the benefit of their life experience and knowledge. I applaud her for that.\u201d\n\nCarson is the second jockey to have tested positive for cocaine this year, while three others have \u00adreturned from bans in the past 12 months. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that a range of sports, including ourselves, are seeing an increase in positives for cocaine, as is wider society,\u201d said a BHA spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWe are working with riders through the PJA to understand why this is happening and how it may relate to prohibited drugs outside of racing. We\u2019re looking at how we might support jockeys with better education and information.\u201d\n\nRyan Moore riding Wichita win The Tattersalls Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on September 26 Credit: Getty Images\n\nAt Newmarket on Thursday, Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s two-year-old Wichita ran out an impressive seven-length winner of the Tattersalls Stakes over seven furlongs, while popular stayer Withhold also returned to winning ways in the Jockey Club Rose Bowl.\n\nOn Saturday, Roger Varian could be the trainer to follow. He runs three \u00adfillies, headed by Daahyeh, winner of the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot, but subsequently second in both the Duchess of Cambridge and Moyglare, in the Rockfell Stakes.\n\nAlthough no pushover, it looks a good chance for her to get another win under her belt. He will also be glad to get the unbeaten UAE Jewel back on track after an absence of 146 days in the Joel Stakes.", "description": "William Carson, grandson of the five-time champion Flat jockey Willie Carson, was banned from riding by a disciplinary panel for six months on Thursday for testing \u00adpositive for cocaine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uD2eZFe93z63syzCnmShtQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03OTguOTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a9BWhOKNh6VEfr4I71QsRg--~B/aD0xMTE4O3c9MTc5MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/9f8c471b785d41a0b1c9a9ca46c95c3e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
