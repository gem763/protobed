Far from the Hollywood stars who created her job. There are no windows, like the budget room on a cruise ship, and the 25-year-old with dangly cherry earrings and a jean jacket doesn\u2019t use the harsh, office lights, but does her work to the dim glow of a small lamp, so it feels like a confessional chamber when she gets on a call.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is #MeToo two years later, two years after producer Harvey Weinstein was finally taken down for his predatory behavior.\n\nShe wrote Hollywood\u2019s inclusion rider. But she also works for Walmart cashiers, chicken pluckers and hospital workers\n\nThe calls come in from a farmworker in California. A home caregiver in Texas. A bus driver in Mississippi. A cook in a Philadelphia hotel.\n\nSome of them cry. Most of them are women. All of them called to report they were sexually harassed at work. Big deal, hasn\u2019t this always been going on?\n\nYes, it has. But this time, the call center isn\u2019t just a confessional and trauma-informed therapy talk. A call to this hotline means a lawyer, a lawsuit and action.\n\n\u201cAs people started coming forward about Harvey Weinstein, a group called Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, a (women\u2019s) farmworker group, published this letter called the \u2018Dear Sisters\u2019 letter,\u201d said Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. \u201cIt was a letter to the women who had come forward in Hollywood, and it said \u2018We hear you, we see you, we know what you\u2019re going through because this is what we go through, too.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was at that moment when glittery Hollywood stars with five-figure facials and farmworkers with calloused hands realized they have something in common, Tejani said.\n\nAnd some of those Hollywood women also realized that the momentum of the #MeToo movement could fade once boldface names weren\u2019t involved.\n\n\u201c . . . So I tolerated it.\u201d The women in hypermasculine industries put up with a lot.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to focus on low-wage jobs, retail, janitors, farmworkers,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, the president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, who helped organize the effort. Because at that point, most of the attention to sexual harassment claims went to wealthy, white women.\n\nTurns out that\u2019s exactly what the Hollywood folks wanted, too. Thanks to big-time donors and a wave of support from a GoFundMe page, they started with $24 million.\n\nAD\n\nSince the start of the Time\u2019s Up fund in January 2018, they\u2019ve handled nearly 4,000 cases. Most get referred to a network of about 700 lawyers across the nation who specialize in these types of cases.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe truth is, we need more attorneys. So many more,\u201d Tejani said.\n\nCalls come in to Black, who is not a lawyer, but came to the legal fund from RAINN, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. So she knows how to talk to people who have been through trauma.\n\nEllie Driscoll takes the emails that come in. And the two of them dispatch cases to attorneys across the country. Those attorneys must promise that the first consult will be free. And after that, they will agree on a path for the case. Many of them will take it pro-bono.\n\nAD\n\nA lot of the survivors tell Driscoll and Black that they would never have come forward if they didn\u2019t hear the stories from Hollywood stars who were abused, too.\n\n\u201cDuring the Golden Globes\u201d \u2014 when Time\u2019s Up was often mentioned \u2014 \u201cwe got 200 calls,\u201d Goss Graves said. \u201cDuring. The. Show.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe tucked-away little office in Washington is an important place for these survivors to call because too often, they\u2019ve already tried to tell someone at work.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things we\u2019re seeing is retaliation. Retaliation if they did try to come forward,\u201d Tejani said.\n\nThis woman spoke up about harassment. Then, the retaliation came.\n\nAt their staff meeting last week, they compared notes and agreed that a lot of the callers are women who have reported sexual harassment, and now can\u2019t find other jobs because the report follows them, especially in the restaurant and hotel industries.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDo you think we can use the term \u2018blacklisting?\u2019 \u201d Tejani asks.\n\nBlack nodded vigorously, her cherry earrings bobbing. \u201cThey use it. Almost all of them said \u2018I\u2019ve been blacklisted.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo it is like Hollywood, after all.\n\nThe Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund hotline can be reached at 202-319-3053.\n\nTwitter: @petulad\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nTheir neighbor apparently saved the swastika cookies for special guests\n\nSnarling D.C. traffic was a good thing \u2014 this time\n\nThis scientist wants to know if you helped him 30 years ago\n\nTrump has to build a wall, and military families have to get in the back of the line\n\nAD", "description": "The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund in Washington is designed to give ordinary women the resources to challenge their harassers.", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wxJ4ujFocZ1KZxW9QP7v6Uxudd8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BJXCXBHB7MI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
