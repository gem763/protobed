Feeder zones determine which school a child can enrol in, based on the area in which they live.\n\nFedsas had argued that the Constitution provided for SGBs and the education department to govern schools co-operatively.\n\nRegulation and policy in effect since 2012, gave the department the power to determine the feeder zones of all public schools.\n\nFedsas said those regulations were invalid because they contradicted national legislation.\n\nMoseneke, in upholding the SCA judgment, said none of the department\u2019s regulations were unreasonable, unjustifiable, or irrational.\n\nHe however said the government had unilaterally determined the current feeder zones, thus denying interested parties participation in a matter that materially affected schools.\n\nMoseneke said SGBs were the \u201cvital lifeblood\u201d in learning and teaching and ordinarily advanced pupils\u2019 legitimate interests.\n\n\u201cParents must be meaningfully engaged in the teaching and learning of their children. The Schools Act carves out an important role for parents and other stakeholders in the governance of public schools.\n\nThe court had previously cautioned against the provincial executive exercising undue dominance over SGBs, and had called for co-operative governance between statutory bodies and SGBs, and the MEC and head of department.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Constitutional Court on Friday ruled that the Gauteng Education Department would determine school admissions regulations in the province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3833/7ed5667c7b2f434fb37b078ddb4eb727.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-20"}
