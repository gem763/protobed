A Jack Kerouac bobblehead. Gourmet chocolate cupcakes. A stuffed Brutus Buckeye, the mascot of Ohio State. Once, after a bookstore reading, I received a 45 r.p.m. single of Grand Funk Railroad\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re an American Band.\u201d Also: a whole schiacciata Siciliana (think calzone, only better).\n\nBut I\u2019d never gotten pickles before.\n\nThis was in Portland, Me., two years ago, where I was doing an event with my friend, the novelist Richard Russo. As the night wound down, a transgender woman approached the signing table and handed me an enormous jar full of kosher dills.\n\n\u201cI made you these pickles,\u201d she said somberly, \u201cin solidarity.\u201d\n\nHow had I missed the fact that pickles had become a symbol of the fight for trans equality? I knew about the transgender flag, of course \u2014 designed in 1999 by Monica Helms, a Navy veteran, after her service on the Francis Scott Key and the Flasher, both submarines. The original flag \u2014 alternating blue, pink and white stripes \u2014 was donated to the Smithsonian in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ms. Helms, in spite of her eight years of service to the country, would no longer be welcome in the military, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s hatin\u2019-on-the-trans-people policy. Who else is no longer welcome in the military? Amanda Simpson, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense. Not to mention the over 134,000 veterans who are trans \u2014 and the estimated 15,000 troops who are serving at this moment.", "description": "And why it\u2019s not enough.", "authors": ["Jennifer Finney Boylan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/opinion/18Boylan/18Boylan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
