THE FRIGHTENING WAYS FEAR CAN IMPACT YOUR BODY\n\nRite Aid told its stores to remove all 22-ounce bottles of J&J baby powder on Oct. 18 and transport them to a secure location, company spokesman, Chris Saversese, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we\u2019ve applied a point of sale system block for this product to prevent it from being sold,\" he added.\n\nCNBC reported late on Thursday that Walmart, the world's largest retailer, also removed and blocked all of the recalled baby powder from their stores.\n\nJohnson & Johnson issued a recall of 33,000 bottles of 22-ounce baby powder on Oct. 18 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found trace amounts of asbestos in a single bottle purchased through an unnamed retailer. It was the first instance officials detected traces of asbestos in J&J's product, according to Fox Business.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. announced that it is initiating a voluntary recall in the United States of a single lot of its Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder in response to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) test indicating the presence of sub-trace levels of chrysotile asbestos contamination (no greater than 0.00002%) in samples from a single bottle purchased from an online retailer,\" the company said in a Oct. 18 statement.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has denied the product was dangerous and all of their other Johnson's Baby Powder products will remain on the shelves. The company is facing thousands of pending lawsuits regarding the issue that talc powders cause cancer.\n\nIn June, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay 10 million to a woman who said the baby powder linked to her cancer diagnosis.\n\nBOSTON TODDLER DIAGNOSED WITH MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE ON LIFE SUPPORT, MOM SAYS\n\n\"We will pursue an appeal because Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder does not contain asbestos or cause cancer, as supported by decades of independent clinical evidence,\" J&J said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe CEO of Johnson & Johnson, Alex Gorsky, testified earlier this month that the baby powder brand was safe and free of asbestos, according to Fox Business.\n\n\u201cWe unequivocally believe that our talc and our baby powder does not contain asbestos,\" he said at the time, before the FDA report.\n\nReuters reported last year that company records, trial testimony and other evidence from 1971 to the early 2000s suggested the company did, in fact, know its raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.\n\nJohnson & Johnson has repeated that its talc products are safe, adding that decades of studies have shown them to be asbestos-free, according to the outlet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAsbestos is a known carcinogen that's linked to deadly mesothelioma, a tumor of the tissue that lines the lungs, stomach, heart or other organs.", "description": "Walmart, CVS, and Rite Aid are pulling all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder from their stores after due to asbestos fears after trace amounts were found in one of the bottles.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/baby-powder-2-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
