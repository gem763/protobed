The Secretary-General further asked governments to address the underlying reasons for the crisis and agree on measures to put the United Nations on a sound financial footing.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. is one of the countries that have not paid its contribution in full, an official from the U.S. Mission to the U.N. told Fox News that is in part because of differences in U.S. and U.N. fiscal years.\n\n\u201cTo date this year, we have contributed over $600 million to UN peacekeeping operations, and will be providing the vast majority of the $674 million we owe to the 2019 regular budget this fall, as we have in past years,\u201d the official said. \u201cOverall the United States, as the largest contributor to the UN, contributes roughly $10 billion annually in assessed and voluntary contributions across the United Nations system.\u201d\n\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY BREAKING WITH US ON MOST VOTES, REPORT FINDS\n\nThe official also said the U.S. has been clear that no single member should pay for more than a quarter of the U.N. budget. (The U.S. currently pays approximately 22 percent of the U.N.\u2019s operating budget.)\n\nPresident Trump echoed this sentiment on Wednesday morning, tweeting in reference to reports about the U.N. budget woes: \u201cSo make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States!\u201d\n\nGuterres, meanwhile, says he has requested other measures, including reductions in travel, postponement of spending, and postponing conferences and other meetings.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe U.S. is unlikely to step in to help solve the problem anytime soon. The Trump administration has pushed for a re-evaluation of the U.N. budget and has been skeptical of the U.N.'s alignment with U.S. interests.\n\nA recent State Department report found that the U.N. General Assembly is out of sync with U.S. interests in more than two-thirds of votes taken in 2018.", "description": "The United Nations is facing its worst cash crisis in nearly a decade\u00a0and is warning that it may be unable to pay the\u00a0bills by the end of the month, while urging member states to pay their contributions to the world body immediately.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/24/694940094001_6089156775001_6089161477001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
