The latest version, by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, with Gensler, is an enlargement of an addition of an expansion, and the architects\u2019 mission was not only to provide the ultimate container for the history of modern art but also to repackage MoMA\u2019s own 80-year architectural history. Each of its phases \u2014 Goodwin and Stone\u2019s 1939 original, Philip Johnson and Cesar Pelli\u2019s interpolations, and the wholesale 2004 revamp by Yoshio Taniguchi \u2014 has been absorbed into the new iteration. (Tragically, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien\u2019s American Folk Art Museum was in the way and had to be erased.) The result might have been either a mess or a compromise; instead, it\u2019s a work of confident and self-effacing elegance. Whether it will make a great museum is another question, one that may take time to resolve.\n\nTouring the almost empty megamuseum shortly before the crowds arrive unsettles me with d\u00e9ja vu. Fifteen years ago, I wandered through another new, still vacant MoMA and was enchanted by Taniguchi\u2019s meticulous cool. Without the distraction of other visitors, I could pay attention to walls that appeared to levitate just above the floor, and the deftness with which all the usual messy protuberances \u2014 vents, switches, knobs, cables \u2014 had been subdued into near nonexistence.\n\nThen the museum opened, and bold moves became big problems. I soon began to resent the gaping atrium on the second floor, the vertiginous skybridges, and a lobby that managed to be vast and oppressive at the same time. DS + R have left Taniguchi\u2019s big gestures untouched; that atrium isn\u2019t going anywhere, though it\u2019s slightly better stitched into the building\u2019s fabric. But they have performed some judicious surgery, raising the lobby ceiling, moving gallery doors by a few feet here and there, ripping out and replacing much of the machinery hidden in the walls, and adding a layer of perforated wood to soak up thunderous reverberations.\n\nThe first part of the makeover opened a couple of years ago, but only now can we appreciate how the black-and-white marble lounge, with its vaguely retro glamour, fits into the whole scheme. The challenge was to thread a horizontal paseo through a series of discrete buildings that couldn\u2019t simply be fused into one. Thick walls and portals framed in black steel mark the boundaries between addresses. Slight variations in the floorboards distinguish Taniguchi\u2019s galleries from DS + R\u2019s, if you\u2019re looking for them. The architects even pay a kind of homage to the American Folk Art Museum they demolished, preserving the ghost of its narrow, vertical shape and opaque facade in a stack of glass-fronted galleries. As the museum moves westward, it pushes into the lower floors of a residential tower designed by Jean Nouvel, framed by immense diagonal beams that are, for now, mostly obscured by demure white walls. All these moving parts are united by an aesthetic in which every facet is sharp, thin, smooth, and glossy, like Nicole Kidman on Oscar night.\n\nSeen from West 53rd Street.

The second-floor ceilings are so high that even a big, bright Chris Ofili looks marooned. But the building holds delightful surprises too: wedge-shaped glimpses of midtown, a chapel-like corner for Monet\u2019s Water Lilies, disorienting turns that deliver you into suddenly familiar terrain.\n\nIn architecture, modernism is no longer a movement, but a chronic condition. Variations on steel, glass, and concrete sleekness are the default setting for shelter magazines, shopping centers, apartment towers, hospitals, and office complexes. The late-20th-century style wars that pitted postmodernism against deconstructivism, parametricism against neo-vernacularism, seem quaint today. Today, architects claim proudly to offer no signature look, instead adapting their tastes to the needs of the job. Having a style has gone out of style. Even making the claim for an avant-garde is an old-fashioned thing to do. Maybe that\u2019s why a certain nostalgic yearning permeates the new design. The ghosts of Audrey, Grace, and Jackie sashay through the black-and-white-and-gray locales.\n\n\u201cModernism isn\u2019t over,\u201d Diller remarks. \u201cWe\u2019re still living it, and constantly rethinking it. We\u2019re wiser and more cynical about some of its utopian aspirations, but there are some grand objectives that we\u2019re still working out.\u201d Diller goes on to split those goals into two categories. The first is technical: making glass ever stronger and steel ever thinner, \u201cpushing materials to their limits and thinning them down right to their point of failure.\u201d The firm\u2019s most virtuosic flourish is the vertical stroke that separates the Taniguchi building from the new one, a freestanding wall as slender as a pencil line, wrapped in an equally svelte staircase. The whole structure, which the architects call the \u201cblade\u201d (as in cutting edge), is made of steel but has the look of a drawing. Gravity and density don\u2019t exist, only edges, shading, and air.\n\nDiller\u2019s second goal is social: to strike a balance between democratizing the museum and turning it into the cultural equivalent of an airport. \u201cDecades ago, detractors said that the museum was too elitist,\u201d she says. \u201cNow they say it\u2019s too public, and it\u2019s too hard to commune with a work of art. It\u2019s a dilemma, and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve gotten it right.\u201d\n\nNeither am I. MoMA is a machine for viewing art, and the success of this latest incarnation will be gauged by how many visitors the facility can process in any given day. The new architecture expresses the logic of perpetual growth. Denser crowds bring more money, which buys more art, which requires more space, which demands more money and bigger crowds. It\u2019s no coincidence that the \u201cblade\u201d staircase hangs in the air above another theatrical coup: the store. A double-height wall of books soars from the basement level, past a bridge and up to a scalloped ceiling that catches the eye as well as sucking up sound. Here, facing the street, is a space that declares the museum\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of retail. What is an artwork after all, if not the ultimate consumer good?\n\nThe store is prominent.

This time, the architects installed electronic ticket kiosks, an automated coat-check system, and a choice of entrances, elevators, and pathways, all calculated to smooth the passage of humanity through ample galleries. Trying to assess these mechanisms before the doors open would be like reviewing a play by sitting in an empty theater.\n\nThat play aspires to tell a new story. The old timeline of isms, influences, and great men has been retired. Now, MoMA presents its collection in the form of subplots and interlinked vignettes that span the globe and hopscotch around the decades. Curators have rearranged the collection according to deliberately cryptic rubrics, shuffling periods, and jumbling disparate media. The way to Water Lilies leads past a roomful of Bauhaus architecture and design. On the second floor, a gallery called \u201cPrint, Fold, Send\u201d leads to \u201cTransfigurations,\u201d followed by \u201cBefore and After Tiananmen.\u201d Whether this new organization delights, illuminates, or just irritates you will depend partly on your allegiance to the textbook version of art history, but it has a powerful effect on the architecture.\n\nThe Marie Jos\u00e9e and Henry Kravis Studio.

Artists will keep inventing new ways to use new spaces. The museum was built to evolve. That means that curators can convert vast spaces to cozy rooms and back again by erecting temporary walls; lights, wiring, and ventilation systems are designed to adapt to almost any configuration and technological need. Visitors can hop on and off the path that loops through each floor, switch directions, take shortcuts, and effectively design their own narrative. The architecture\u2019s primary job is just to get out of the way.\n\nThat vanishing act is an important aspect of modernist architecture\u2019s history. During the last century, ornamentation evaporated, walls became transparent, solidity gave way to featheriness. That fetish of lightness has endured, like a granite boulder. \u201cIf you raise a lot of money, I will give you great, great architecture,\u201d Taniguchi boasted to MoMA before the 2004 go-around. \u201cBut if you raise really a lot of money, I will make the architecture disappear.\u201d The museum came up with several staggering fortunes ($850 million then, another $450 million now), and that aesthetic of quasi-nothingness has swallowed almost an entire block of midtown. I wonder how soon this latest giant will feel cramped, too \u2014 how soon MoMA will be on the move again.", "description": "Review by Justin Davidson: The New MoMA, Redesigned and Enlarged by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Tries to Get Out of Its Own Way.
