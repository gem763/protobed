Now asylum workers are fighting back.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nKen Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nOpinion writer\n\nOne of the highest values that President Trump and immigration adviser Stephen Miller cherish is the goal of making it as hard as possible for desperate migrants to appeal for refuge in the United States \u2014 even if they would qualify for it under U.S. law.\n\nTrump and Miller have gone about this in many devious ways, and one under-the-radar tactic they\u2019ve used is to change the pre-screening process through which migrants apply to enter the asylum system, to make it harder to even get a hearing at all.\n\nNow, however, the union for the asylum officers who administer this process is fighting back: It\u2019s taking the unusual step of filing a friend-of-the-court brief in a lawsuit against the administration the officers work for.\n\nThe brief from the asylum workers\u2019 union \u2014 the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council 119, which represents thousands of workers who run the asylum system, including conducting pre-screening interviews \u2014 condemns the new policy as arbitrary, illegal and cruel.\n\n\u201cThese changes are contrary to U.S. and international law and cruelly place asylum seekers at risk of being returned to countries where their life or freedom may be in jeopardy,\u201d Michael Knowles, special representative for Council 119, told me Friday.\n\nThe lawsuit in question was filed in D.C. District Court in June by two refugee groups, on behalf of five plaintiffs who failed the screening for \u201ccredible fear.\u201d A judge temporarily blocked the removal of two of them, but the policy has gone into effect.\n\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration\u2019s changes to what\u2019s known as the \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview, the first threshold for migrants requesting asylum. It\u2019s supposed to determine whether they have a chance of eventually qualifying, and if they pass it, they enter the system to await a formal hearing before a judge.\n\nThe new policy changes the \u201clesson plan\u201d used by hundreds of asylum officers, with the goal of making it harder to pass that credible-fear screening. Restrictionists have long argued that this screening is too easy to pass, resulting in more people getting admitted into the system than ultimately qualify for asylum in the end.\n\nAdministration officials want to restrict asylum-seeking because they claim large percentages of those who pass the test disappear into the interior and don\u2019t show up for hearings. But the most up-to-date numbers debunk that claim.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the new policy requires asylum officers to demand that migrants present a factual record demonstrating a significant possibility of future persecution upfront, when they may not have access to one, rather than merely demonstrating a significant possibility of prevailing at the eventual hearing, as under current law.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, asylum seekers only have to show at the credible-fear stage that they have a significant possibility of establishing eligibility for asylum,\u201d Justin Cox, senior supervising attorney for the International Refugee Assistance Project, a group behind the lawsuit along with RAICES, told me. \u201cThis lesson plan tried to raise the standard Congress created.\u201d\n\nNow the asylum workers\u2019 union has filed a brief for the plaintiffs. This is not typical: The union has done this only once before, filing a brief against Trump\u2019s policy of forcing migrants to remain in Mexico. As The Post\u2019s Maria Sacchetti noted at the time, this constituted an \u201cunusual public rebuke of a sitting president by his own employees.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, that\u2019s now happening a second time.\n\nThe union\u2019s brief, which I\u2019ve obtained, points out that there is a moral and humanitarian reason that the initial credible-fear screening is easier to pass, relative to the final hearing. At that initial stage, migrants just concluded \u201charrowing journeys,\u201d are held in detention, aren\u2019t expected to have access to lawyers and won\u2019t have adequate representation.\n\nGiven those realities, the brief notes, making the credible-fear screening relatively easy is needed to avoid denying entry to the system (and an eventual hearing) to people who actually will end up meriting asylum. Thus, the brief argues, making the screening harder is not \u201cconsistent with Due Process.\u201d\n\nThe change in the lesson plan is not a small matter. As the brief notes, it is tampering with asylum officers\u2019 ability to ensure that those exercising their legal right to apply for asylum are treated in keeping with \u201cdomestic law and the United States\u2019 treaty obligations.\u201d\n\nThe new standard, the brief acidly notes, \u201cimpermissibly raises the burden of proof for credible fear determinations\u201d for people who have \u201ccrossed the border with nothing more than the shirts on their backs and are then detained.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen how far this lawsuit gets. But for now, it\u2019s notable that asylum officers are again publicly challenging the administration. It\u2019s another indication of a brewing asylum officers\u2019 rebellion against Trump\u2019s policies: Several recently told Molly O\u2019Toole that they were deeply unnerved over sending asylum seekers back to Mexico, with one lamenting: \u201cI hope they\u2019re alive.\u201d\n\nAll this is yet another reminder that for Trump and Miller, the overarching goal is to reduce the numbers of immigrants legally here \u2014 even or especially if it means preventing people from getting a fair hearing who would otherwise qualify for asylum. To Trump and Miller, blocking that from happening is a feature, not a bug.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s outsourcing of the asylum process sets an un-American example to the world\n\nGreg Sargent: Sotomayor\u2019s brutal dissent unmasks an ugly truth about Trump\n\nFareed Zakaria: Democrats must address the roots of our asylum crisis \u2014 or give Trump the advantage\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The U.S. is slamming the door on asylum seekers\n\nEmily Reed: U.S. immigration officials are manipulating illiterate migrants.
