Most of the characters in the film also mistakenly believe themselves to be caught up in the kind of conspiracy thriller that flourished in the 1970s (Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, Marathon Man, etc.). It never occurs to Harry that the car following him might be driven by a private eye hired by his wife\u2019s attorneys (shades of The Big Lebowski), rather than some government spook. Linda and Chad imagine themselves to be moles-in-training solemnly delivering the worthless CD they found on the gym\u2019s locker room floor to the \u201ccultural attach\u00e9\u201d at the Russian embassy (a return performance by Miller\u2019s Crossing\u2019s Olek Krupa). And Cox believes that the buffoons he encounters are somehow involved in the same \u201cpolitical\u201d conspiracy that brought his CIA career to an end. All of these misconceptions interlock with lethal precision\u2014Blood Simple reimagined as a dark joke. Moreover, it can\u2019t be a coincidence that the rampant, if comical, paranoia of the film coincided with escalating real-world concerns about government surveillance\u2014especially given that the movie opens and closes with a zoom in from, and then back out to, the presumed view from a spy satellite.\n\n\u2022 Angst regarding Big Brother aside, there is a more fundamental theme of mid-life crisis and ennui running throughout the film. (It could have been titled No Country for Middle-Aged Men and Women.) The gym, the bed-hopping, the retreat into booze\u2014in one way or another, almost every character is turning away from adulthood, regressing or \u201creinventing\u201d themselves. And they\u2019re doing so at least in part, I\u2019d venture, thanks to the most notable absence in the movie: kids. Not a single one of these 40- and 50-something Washingtonians appears to have any. (The closest we come to parenthood is a scene of visceral hostility between Swinton\u2019s character, a pediatrician, and her young patient.) Trust me when I say that, in real-life, most of these folks would be far too busy with soccer practices and chorus rehearsals and birthday parties to devote half so much energy to adultery or extortion or the construction of elaborate sex machines. But in Burn After Reading, the absence of such domestic obligations is palpable, and the characters are all searching for some new innovation\u2014a makeover, a memoir, a new conquest\u2014to give purpose to their lives.\n\n\u2022 Which brings me to perhaps my favorite element of the film: the CIA higher-ups played by David Rasche (as Cox\u2019s former boss, Palmer Smith) and the great J.K. Simmons (who, if there is any justice, received this role as consolation for his appearance in The Ladykillers). Though the two are not explicitly presented as narrators, they ultimately perform a function not unlike that of Tommy Lee Jones in No Country for Old Men or Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski. They frame the opening and closing of the movie, with one appearance in between, and as figures of perceived authority they offer the moral context within which to interpret the intervening events. The joke, of course, is that the context they supply is completely, abominably amoral. In place of Jones\u2019s sorrow at the tragedies that have come to pass, we instead have a heartless bureaucratic handwashing. Midway through the film Simmons tells Rasche to \u201cReport back to me, I dunno \u2026 when it makes sense.\u201d But nothing makes sense until the final scene\u2014my favorite, I confess\u2014when most of the movie\u2019s characters are dead, comatose, or en route to Venezuela. (The cut from Malkovich's\u2019s horrifying hatchet-wielding on the streets of Georgetown to Simmons\u2019s \u201cWait, wait a minute\u201d interruption is remarkably wicked, and wickedly funny.) \u201cWhat did we learn, Palmer?\u201d Simmons asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t fucking know either. I guess we learned not to do it again \u2026 But I\u2019m fucked if I know what we did.\u201d I certainly understand why the bleak, black humor of Burn After Reading is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. But I hope I\u2019ve manged to convey a sense of why, somewhat to my own surprise, it\u2019s mine.", "description": "Sex farce masquerades as a spy flick in the brothers' blackest comedy.", "authors": ["Christopher Orr"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/09/Brad_Pitt_Dance/facebook.jpg?1522685866", "published_at": "2014-09-30"}
