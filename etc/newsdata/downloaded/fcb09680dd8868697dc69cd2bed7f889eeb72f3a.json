I won't be friends with someone because their husband or boyfriend plays for the same team. I'm lucky to have the friends I have, I've got a close circle and I trust them implicitly.\n\n\"I wouldn't be friends with someone just because they have a nice bag, a nice pair of shoes - I'm not that fickle.\"\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBecky said she used to describe herself as \"a whirlwind that came in and f**ked s**t up\", before admitting one pal had even bought her a self-help book about making friends because \"I just push everyone away all the time and I didn't trust anyone\".\n\nShe went on: \"I thought everyone was out to get me. But I realise now that's how I taught myself to be, because of everything that had gone on in my past. I didn't want to let anyone in, because I thought everyone was going to hurt me.\n\n\"It took someone like Jamie, to be the way he's been with me, for me to realise not everyone's out to get me, and focus on the positives.\"\n\n(Image: Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror)\n\nIt comes after Becky claimed she'd hired a forensic social media expert to look into Coleen's allegations, after the Scouse WAG set a cunning trap to find out who the rat was.\n\nColeen, who suspected someone from her inner circle of trusted friends and family was leaking stories to the press, gradually blocked her followers from watching her Instagram Stories, then started posting snippets of fake information to see who would take the bait.\n\nIn the end, according to Coleen's claims, the only follower watching her Stories was Becky Vardy's account, prompting Coleen to take the matter to her lawyers before drafting her blistering bombshell statement for Twitter.", "description": "Nearly a week after the Wagatha Christie affair, Rebekah Vardy's old interview sees her slating \"fake\" friends and admitting she trusts very few people", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "David Fisher Rex Shutterstock", "Andy Stenning Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8298738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rebekah-Vardy-consoles-Jamie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
