REUTERS/Liz Lee\n\nSome politicians within Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s ruling coalition had promised to halt the firm\u2019s operations when campaigning in the May 2018 election, after concerns were raised by politicians and activists about the production of radioactive waste from the process.\n\nLynas, the largest rare earths producer outside China that sells most of its products to Japan, says the low-level radioactive waste is not hazardous.\n\nThe government said last month it was extending the firm\u2019s licence, a move that sparked protests from activists and politicians even though it set tougher terms and offered a six-month extension that was shorter than usual.\n\nOutlining reasons for the government\u2019s decision, the prime minister\u2019s office said closing the operation would lead to more than 600 local employees losing their jobs and it would have a \u201cnegative impact on Malaysia\u2019s credibility as a business-friendly country\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office also said in the statement that failing to extend the licence would mean Malaysia would be \u201cunable to break the Chinese monopoly as the sole exporter of rare earths\u201d.\n\nChina has a tight grip on the rare earths market, as the world\u2019s biggest producer of the minerals that are used in smartphones and other consumer electronics, and also used in the defense industry and other sectors.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense has been in talks with Australia to host a facility that would process rare earth minerals in an effort to reduce reliance on China for the specialized materials.\n\nActivists in Malaysia have urged the government to review the decision to extend the licence for Lynas.\n\n\u201cWe hope they can re-examine their mistakes and start to serve the interests of the people,\u201d Tan Bun Teet, chairman of non-government group \u2018Save Malaysia Stop Lynas\u2019, told Reuters.\n\n(The story corrects second graph to show some ruling coalition politicians had anti-Lynas position, not PM\u2019s party.)", "description": "Malaysia's government said on Wednesday its decision last month to extend a licence for Australia's Lynas Corp for processing rare earth minerals aimed to show investors that the Southeast Asian nation was open for business and preserve 600 jobs.", "authors": ["Liz Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426130867&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8311R"}
