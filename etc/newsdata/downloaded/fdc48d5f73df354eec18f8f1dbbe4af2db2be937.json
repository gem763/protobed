In April 2018, Bolton suggested applying the \u201cLibyan model\u201d to North Korea regarding denuclearization, Mediatite reported. After North Korea hit back at Bolton\u2019s comments, Trump followed. He told reporters Wednesday that this 2018 discussion \u201cset [them] back very badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWillie, as you know, the Libyan model actually diplomatically was seen as a great success,\u201d Scarborough added. \u201cAnd the president would just have to be completely ignorant of history and have ignored the news for the past 15 years, which I\u2019m sure he did, to not understand that they were talking about how the United States worked to disarm Libya\u2019s WMD weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cBolton wasn\u2019t sufficiently pro Taliban enough \u2026 This is a guy, Willie, this is a guy who continues and we\u2019ve said it for some time, but he keeps doing it. Embracing our enemies and insulting our allies. And I don\u2019t think John Bolton was ever going fit neatly into that sort of ideological construct.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Joe Scarborough has some 'unique' ideas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3FVAHApgcoX8d74VRPNjDg--~B/aD05OTU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/f7c2cd4b400f05c88f83dac050e4397c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
