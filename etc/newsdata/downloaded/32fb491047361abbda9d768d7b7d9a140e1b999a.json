The power utility instituted four days of rotational power cuts last week. It has not ordered power cuts since Sunday.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday morning the utility said its recovery process was on track. Last week the utility blamed the cuts on boiler leaks and the breakdown of a conveyor belt transporting coal to Medupi power station. This was exacerbated by delays in returning units that were on planned maintenance to service, as well as low diesel and water stocks.\n\nEskom said unplanned breakdowns were now below 10 500MW, but did not provide a precise figure. It added that all units from Hendrina power station, which tripped on Monday, had been successfully returned to service.\n\n- Compiled by Jan Cronje", "description": "But it again warned that power rationing could return at short notice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8496/068d4501778947f496a75bfd50e08eaa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
