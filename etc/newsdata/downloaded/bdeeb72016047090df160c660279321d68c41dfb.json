At the moment, he is probably the one player that can change everything for us and we want to help him keep going like that, scoring and scoring.\n\n\u201cI feel at the moment, there are no limits for him. It's about us to help him to achieve all his targets and try to get out the best possible Raheem Sterling in the next few months.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: EMPICS SPORT)\n\n\u201cI think he is among the best five attacking players in the world right now. It's all about consistency.\n\n\u201cAs of now, he has shown in the last year-and-a-half that he's able to be that consistent. If he continues like that, he can be on the top.\u201d\n\nSterling, who tormented Villa throughout the game, set City on their way to a deserved win with the opener, 25 seconds after the restart, drilling a low left-footed shot beyond Tom Heaton.\n\nFurther goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gundogan sealed the win, the only blot a late red card for Fernandinho, which means the midfielder \u2013 who has been filling in at centre-back - will miss tomorrow's Carabao Cup tie against Southampton , a game in which he was unlikely to figure.\n\nGundogan revealed how Guardiola's brutal half-time team talk ensured City emerged for the second-half with greater purpose and intensity, enabling them to secure the win that has kept them within touching distance of leaders and title rivals Liverpool.\n\n\u201cAt half-time he wanted a little bit more than what we showed in the first-half,\u201d said Gundogan. \u201cHe thought we weren't playing good enough to compete for the title.\n\n\u201cObviously we wanted to put that on the pitch straight away and it worked out perfectly, exactly how the manager wanted, what he demanded.\n\n\u201cWe could have scored in the first-half, we created good chances and we weren't clinical enough. But we responded very well in the second-half and it was a well deserved win\u201d\n\n\u201cThe earlier we score, the better for us. But sometimes it's about patience, sometimes we're not able to score straight away. So we have to wait. That is also a skill, to wait for the right moment, not to lose your nerve.\u201d", "description": "Raheem Sterling has scored 13 goals in 14 appearances for Man City and added to his tally against Aston Villa on Saturday", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Manchester City Fc Via Getty Ima", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735110.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-v-Aston-Villa-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
