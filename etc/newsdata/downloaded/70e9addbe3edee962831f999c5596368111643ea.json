It\u2019s insulting and offensive to the entire city, to every District resident. What in the world do you think it tells our LGBTQ community that the USAO won\u2019t even show up for a conversation about hate crimes?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe hearing was in response to an investigation this summer by The Washington Post showing that despite record numbers of arrests for bias-motivated incidents, the number of cases charged as hate crimes by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office plummeted in 2017 and 2018.\n\nLast year, police made arrests in a record 59 hate crime cases involving adults, The Post found. But Liu\u2019s office, which handles most criminal cases in the capital, prosecuted only three as hate crimes, and one was quickly dropped.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s atrocious and doesn\u2019t represent who we are as a city,\u201d Allen said of the statistics.\n\nThe District is the only place in the country where local crimes are prosecuted by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, whose leader is appointed by the president. The setup makes it hard to hold prosecutors accountable, advocates say. Liu was appointed by President Trump in September 2017.\n\nAD\n\nThis year the number of suspected hate crimes is on pace to reach a new high, eclipsing the record of 204 set last year. Reports of hate crimes were up nearly 14 percent through the end of September, according to data from D.C. police.\n\nAllen and council member David Grosso (I), who was sitting in on the hearing, noted that the U.S. attorney\u2019s office also did not appear at an Oct. 3 committee hearing on firearms trafficking.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot having them at the table is causing us to continue to seek what they are going to do to help try to resolve these issues in our city,\u201d Grosso said.\n\nCouncil Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), who sat in on part of the hearing, said he found Liu\u2019s letter \u201cquite defensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t want to make the U.S. attorney . . . defensive, at the same time I think the U.S. attorney has to be held accountable for how she or he is handling hate crimes,\u201d Mendelson said.\n\nAD\n\nIn her statement, Liu said the hearing\u2019s title showed the committee already had reached a conclusion, regardless of whether she testified.\n\n\u201cThis unjustly maligns the Office\u2019s dedicated career prosecutors, who carefully review every arrest identified as a potential bias-related crime and make principled charging decisions based solely on the law and the facts,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD\n\nIn a separate letter, Liu added that the hearing notice \u201cgives the inaccurate impression that USAO-DC is not prosecuting alleged bias-related crimes at all unless it charges the bias-related enhancement,\u201d when, in fact, her office had charged most cases referred by police \u2014 just not as a hate crime.\n\nAs The Post\u2019s investigation pointed out, however, Liu\u2019s office secured a far lower conviction rate in bias-related cases it declined to charge as hate crimes in 2017 than previous U.S. attorneys achieved by charging cases as hate crimes.\n\nAD\n\nAnd advocates say that a failure to charge bias-motivated violence as a hate crime leaves victims and minority communities feeling like their identity has been ignored or erased.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post\u2019s months-long analysis of more than 200,000 D.C. police and court records found that hate crime prosecutions and convictions are at their lowest point in at least a decade.\n\nIn her letter, Liu said the District\u2019s hate crime law allows for jury instructions that may create \u201cconfusion\u201d during hate crime trials, resulting in fewer convictions.\n\nMike Silverstein, an advisory neighborhood commissioner in Ward 2, echoed those comments.\n\n\u201cPlease clarify jury instructions on what constitutes a hate crime,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cClean it up.\u201d\n\nBut Allen pointed out that the council does not write jury instructions. Instead, that responsibility falls to a committee of local legal practitioners, including judges, defense attorneys and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKaterina Semyonova from the D.C. Public Defender Service said she was on the legal committee and did not recall Liu\u2019s office mentioning the issue of confusing jury instructions for hate crimes.\n\nRichard Gilbert from the D.C. Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers said he would raise the issue at the legal committee\u2019s meeting Friday.\n\nPart of the hearing centered on two bills that would limit the ability of people charged with violent crimes to claim that they acted in self-defense when they learned the victim was gay or transgender \u2014 the so-called gay or trans \u201cpanic\u201d defense.\n\nWhile several advocates and advisory neighborhood commissioners spoke in support of the bills, Semyonova, Gilbert and Nina Ginsberg, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, all argued that the legislation would unconstitutionally curtail a defendant\u2019s right to a full defense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Liu\u2019s absence left a hole at the center of the committee hearing. Allen apologized several times for asking advocates about their conversations with the absent U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d ask them if they were here,\u201d he said at one point.\n\nAnd when it came time for government officials to speak, Allen called out repeatedly for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, as if reenacting the classroom scene from the movie \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Ms. Liu here?\u201d Allen asked. \u201cOr any representative from U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia? Anyone from USAO here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he continued. \u201cShould the United States attorney\u2019s office show up, we\u2019ll certainly pull up a chair.\u201d\n\nLiu\u2019s seat remained empty.\n\nAD", "description": "Jessie K.
