Labour has been gifted victory. What does it conspire to do? Punch itself in the face\n\nYesterday was a very good day to bury a bad conference. Three weeks ago, rapidly oxidising political genius Dominic Cummings briefed that the Tories were going to \u201cwreck\u201d the Labour party\u2019s annual gathering. After three days in Brighton, it was hard to see how even Downing Street\u2019s Eric Cartman could have done a better job of it than the party themselves. Maybe he could have made Labour go on for an extra day? Or had a few more Dadaist votes on their Brexit position? In the end, Cummings master-strategised himself on to the wrong end of a monster constitutional VAR decision, taking one of his \u201calternative branches of history\u201d right up the jacksy, and delivering Labour the considerable benefit of averting people\u2019s eyes from their unforced errors here.\n\nSixteen hours earlier, Len McCluskey \u2013 who bestrides conference\u2019s jugular like a colossus \u2013 had been telling the TV cameras the party\u2019s shambolic show-of-hands vote on a Brexit position was a democratic triumph. \u201cEverybody\u2019s a winner here today,\u201d the Unite boss beamed. \u201cEverybody.\u201d Oh Len. You should definitely tell that to the people I can still hear screaming \u201cCARD VOTE?!?!?!\u201d \u2013 in vain \u2013 in the hall behind you, having been denied the opportunity to #usepens. At a fringe event later that evening, it was mentioned that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s approval rating is minus 60, the worst for an opposition leader since comparable polling records began. \u201cSo what?\u201d called someone in the audience. Madam, I am sure it is a sublime irrelevance.\n\nAs usual, this conference featured a number of Labour figures and outriders dismissing the implications of the fact their guy is trailing to a man they consistently recognise as Britain\u2019s leading useless shit. The general line is: \u201cI\u2019d expect Jeremy to put on X number of points in a campaign situation.\u201d Good for you. I\u2019d expect him to already be miles ahead of Boris Johnson, who, in the past three weeks alone, has lost control of Parliament; emitted a primal grunt as one of his MPs defected while he was conducting prime minister\u2019s questions; failed to stop the Commons passing a Brexit extension law; expelled 21 of his own MPs, including two former chancellors and his hero Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson; driven his own brother from the cabinet and politics; whiteyed a policewoman during a speech in which he appeared to have stirred a teaspoon of ketamine into his tea before going on \u2026\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to have to crack open a new paragraph because that one got too long. Continuing with Boris Johnson\u2019s September, then: the prime minister lost another cabinet minister, Amber Rudd, who in effect accused him of lying to the public; continued to be heckled by multiple members of said public every time he went out, including a new father who lambasted him for the state of the NHS outside a neonatal ward; declared himself the Incredible Hulk, only to be humiliated by the prime minister of Luxembourg after refusing to do a joint press conference because some people were shouting at him; it was revealed that a model-entrepreneur-whatever, whose flat he reportedly used to visit between mayoring stints, received \u00a3126,000 of public money; refused to answer questions about any of that; and has now suffered the Supreme Court/jacksy interface. There\u2019s more \u2013 so much more \u2013 but simply not the space.\n\nSo yes: on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn was able to take to the conference stage to call for the resignation of the above guy. How is that for being born under a lucky sign? At that moment, and really quite by accident, he ended up looking better than Boris Johnson, even though he still delivers speeches with the same mesmeric vim your optician wonders: \u201cAnd is it clearer with this lens \u2026 or without? With \u2026. or without?\u201d Corbyn somehow seems to get worse at it the more of them he does. A bit like Emma Watson in the Harry Potter movies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Democratically elected \u2026 Tom Watson outside the conference. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nAs you do when you have a radical and often interesting policy agenda, conference began with eye-catching, headline-frotting attempts to abolish deputy leader Tom Watson, a man democratically elected by Labour members. Even as the Supreme Court was handing down is judgment on Boris Johnson\u2019s unlawful suspension of Parliament, conference delegates were still being handed leaflets bearing the headline: \u201cSHUN TOM WATSON!\u201d (If you\u2019re not familiar with the joy of sects, a Labour shunning is much like an Amish shunning, except you don\u2019t have to raise a barn afterwards.)\n\nHaving failed to see Watson off, the Supreme Court news enabled Labour to bump his speech to the Wednesday morning so that Corbyn could speak on the Tuesday instead. Watson promptly tweeted that he would not be speaking at all. So we\u2019ll never know whether Labour\u2019s deputy leader would have been formally shunned. As he put it: \u201cI\u2019ll save the speech I was going to make to conference until next year.\u201d And you can set your watch by that. As long as it\u2019s one of those edible sweet-bracelet watches with a big fizzy face.\n\nDay two of conference dawned to news of the pending departure of Andrew Fisher, one of Corbyn\u2019s very closest aides. Fisher\u2019s was a mild sort of resignation, accusing the most senior figures in the party ranks of \u201cclass war\u201d, \u201ca blizzard of lies and excuses\u201d, \u201ca lack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d, and concluding: \u201cI no longer have faith we can succeed.\u201d Only in Labour \u2013 and this genuinely happened \u2013 could Fisher then have had Sunday breakfast with Corbyn and his team in the full view of the conference hotel dining room. I do hope the waiter made the most of it. \u201cWould you like a newspaper with your breakfast, Mr Fisher? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve read the Sunday Times. Ooh, what am I like \u2013 you\u2019ve written half of it. Still, nothing some beans on toast can\u2019t smooth over.\u201d\n\nLight moments were in short supply. That said, Emily Thornberry opened her speech with some anecdote about falling off her bike and her life flashing before her eyes, and tapping her nose suggestively about some of the naughty fun she remembered having. Owing to the gesture being misunderstood, Thornberry was forced to clarify her position shortly after her speech, tweeting: \u201cJust for the removal of doubt, I was channelling Kenneth Williams in the Carry On films when I tapped my nose, not Pablo Bloody Escobar!!!\u201d Lol don\u2019t worry, conference \u2013 the shadow foreign secretary isn\u2019t doing her cocaine material, just the sexytime stuff. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s what the Palestinians would have wanted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nudge, nudge \u2026 Emily Thornberry confuses her audience. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nLike Keir Starmer \u2013 whose expression during Corbyn\u2019s speech might have been that of a man realising he isn\u2019t going to get all of the Infinity Stones in time \u2013 Thornberry was primarily preoccupied with getting conference to adopt a position in which the party would campaign for remain at the next election. The good news is we\u2019ve found the only thing worse than the modern pox of \u201cgender reveal parties\u201d for couples expecting a baby. The bad news is that it\u2019s Labour\u2019s Brexit position reveal party, an event that now seems to have been happening for actual years. We will now have to wait until special one-day conference after the election to find out whether it\u2019s a girl Brexit position or a boy one.\n\nBefore the big vote, Thornberry likened this moment to the one in Star Wars where the rebels are trapped in the garbage crusher. \u201cYou get the hero standing in the middle,\u201d she explained at one fringe event, \u201cand the walls are coming in.\u201d Please don\u2019t tell me that Jeremy Corbyn is Han Solo in this \u2013 but go on. \u201cThe answer is not to just stand there and go: \u2018Oh well, I\u2019m right,\u2019\u201d explained Thornberry. \u201cThe answer is to get out of there.\u201d Well, actually \u2026 technically, the answer is to get R2-D2 to disable all the trash compactors on the detention level of the Death Star. Or, I guess, get another R2 unit to disable the Labour powerbrokers who reckon it is better to achieve a show of loyalty to Corbyn than a Brexit position that doesn\u2019t fill with dread the person who has to ring a civilian doorbell and explain it.\n\nI\u2019m afraid no such R2 unit emerged. And for all the fire cover afforded by the Worst Government In History\u2122, what happened here in Brighton still happened. Whenever the next election comes \u2013 possibly in about 15 minutes \u2013 Labour will go into it with a Brexit policy that we already know makes every shadow minister who says it on TV sound like a stone-cold dick. And which goes viral \u2013 in an avian flu sort of way \u2013 every time one of them attempts it. We will come to the farcical voting scenes via which it was arrived at shortly. In the meantime, it is to be hoped that Labour will soon vote, ideally via a show of hands, to convene a special conference to decide how badly they messed this one up.\n\nDo people notice? There is a classic Victoria Wood mockumentary on the making of Acorn Antiques, her brilliant parodic soap opera set in an antique shop. A series of entirely self-induced setbacks mean cast and crew have run out of time, and have to shoot an episode that will go out live. Backstage at one point during the broadcast, tea lady Mrs Overall is so taken up with a humblebrag anecdote that she misses her cue, and enters the scene without her crucial tea tray. Given most of the lines relate to the contents of that tray, she and the other characters are forced to mime holding one in the ensuing discussion about the various items on it. Clearly, it\u2019s a disastrous and avoidable shambles, and there\u2019s panic in the director\u2019s gallery. \u201cShall we cut? Go back?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d drawls the monstrous show producer with a smile. \u201cWe professionals notice. Joe Public never clocks a damn thing.\u201d\n\nThis high-handed insouciance is the preferred get-out at Labour conference, where needless rows and unprofessionalism are blithely assumed not to cut through. I spoke to figures from the top of the party downward telling me \u2013 and perhaps themselves \u2013 that the public doesn\u2019t pay attention to the plotting and walkouts and so on. But guys \u2026 that still doesn\u2019t mean you should do it?\n\nJoe Public does occasionally clock things that appear on the main news bulletins, however, and the decision to screen clips of Labour\u2019s handling of the back-remain-now motion means it might dimly have penetrated the consciousness of those dim remainers. It really was some special telly.\n\nBy way of a curtain-raiser, John McDonnell had conceded: \u201cThere will be a bit of banter.\u201d In the event, there was bantergeddon (superseded 16 hours later by the Supreme Court banterpocalypse). After a closely run show of hands, this was the precise dialogue from the platform featuring the chair, Wendy Nichols, and Labour\u2019s general secretary Jennie Formby:\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A show of hands \u2026 Labour remain campaigners. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian\n\nNichols: \u201cSorry, I thought it was one way, and Jennie said something else, so \u2026\u201d [clamour from the floor]\n\nFormby: \u201cIt is lost.\u201d\n\nNichols: Yeah \u2026 that was lost.\u201d [cheers/uproar]\n\nNichols: [to Formby] They\u2019re calling for a card vote. It\u2019s obviously a card vote. There\u2019s enough of them on their feet.\u201d [clamour/uproar, the \u201cOh Jeremy Corbyn chant\u201d]\n\nNichols: \u201cIn my view it was carried.\u201d\n\nFormby: \u201cIt was lost. It was lost.\u201d\n\nFormby: [inaudible]\n\nNichols: \u201cSorry. Sorry. I\u2019m getting advice. It was lost.\u201d\n\nSo there you go. I\u2019m not sure of the wisdom of bringing this democracy masterclass to a wider TV audience. At the best of times the rules and processes of Labour conference appear entirely impenetrable to outsiders. Composites, cancelled NEC meetings, late-night stitch-ups \u2026 What happens in the hall and beyond is partly The Glass Bead Game, the elaborate and rarefied pastime in Herman Hesse\u2019s novel, whose intricacies and opacities take a lifetime to master. But it is also partly Boar on the Floor, a bonding parlour game featured in a recent Succession episode about a corporate hunting trip, which sees participants forced to crawl around the floor of a Hungarian lodge and fight for sausages, willingly or otherwise, in a game that had zero rules beyond the bullying whim of the terrifying paterfamilias. Sorry, I know we\u2019ve already mentioned everyone\u2019s favourite self-appointed Boar Master, Len McCluskey.\n\nThe upshot of Brighton is that Labour have once again done well out of events beyond their control. Events within their control, not so much. Just as Jose Mourinho\u2019s footballing philosophy in effect regards even having the ball as a needless risk, so Labour seem to think that being gifted historic constitutional drama and cock-up by the other side counts as having played well. It doesn\u2019t. Interesting and appealing policy announcements were allowed to be overshadowed by plotting, division and endless, needless machinations. That said, Mourinho once progressed to a Champions\u2019 League final after a game in which his side had 19% possession \u2013 and our politics is more volatile than ever. So don\u2019t rule anything out for Labour, from actually managing to beat Conservative party history\u2019s worst lying satyriasis-afflicted Queen-insulting unlawful humanoid, to losing to him, to drawing and having to form a coalition government with Bayern Munich.", "description": "Boris Johnson is on the ropes, the worst PM in history.
