Why not just bury them?", "language": "en", "text": "Why can't California's fire-prone power lines be buried underground, out of harm's way?\n\nThat was the question many were asking this week as hundreds of thousands of customers lost power in the Sacramento and San Francisco areas in preemptive shutoffs by Pacific Gas & Electric. Further south, another 200,000 customers of other utilities faced warnings that they too could lose power due to high winds.\n\nExperts say the answer is simple: money.\n\n\"It's very, very expensive,\" said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley professor of business administration and public policy who specializes in energy. Borenstein was speaking through the crackly static of a cellphone outside his darkened home in the San Francisco suburb of Orinda on Thursday evening. The Berkeley campus was shut down and his home had lost power, too, after PG&E instituted a mandatory \"de-energization\" across nearly 40 counties due to high fire threats.\n\nIt costs about $3 million per mile to convert underground electric distribution lines from overhead, while the cost to build a mile of new overhead line is less than a third of that, at approximately $800,000 per mile, according to a section on PG&E's website called Facts About Undergrounding Power Lines.\n\nPhotos: California wildfires spark mandatory evacuations in Los Angeles\n\nCalifornia has 25,526 miles of higher voltage transmission lines, and 239,557 miles of distribution lines, two-thirds of which are overhead, according to CPUC. Less than 100 miles per year are transitioned underground, meaning it would take more than 1,000 years to underground all the lines at the current rate.\n\nIn this Nov. 13 photo, Southern California Edison crews work to replace burned power poles and lines destroyed by the Woolsey Fire on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. More\n\n$15,000 for every PG&E customer?\n\nPG&E, the state's largest utility, maintains approximately 81,000 miles of overhead distribution lines and approximately 26,000 miles of underground distribution lines. It also has about 18,000 miles of larger transmission lines, the majority of which are overhead lines.\n\nAt a cost of $3 million per mile, undergrounding 81,000 miles of distribution lines would cost $243 billion. PG&E has 16 million customers; distributing that expense equally would amount to a bill of more than $15,000 per account.\n\n\"It's very expensive,\" said Constance Gordon, a public information officer with the California Public Utilities Commission. \"The utilities don't want to pay for it out of their pockets, so ratepayers would have to pitch in, and people don't want to pay for that.\"\n\nPG&E is not flush with cash: The investor-owned utility filed for bankruptcy in January, facing $11 billion in liabilities related to wildfires. This week, the company's shares tumbled after a federal bankruptcy judge ruled that the utility no longer had the sole right to shape the terms of its reorganization.\n\nBackground: California power outages aim to reduce risk of wildfires caused by dry and windy weather\n\nWatch: Power cuts affect many across Northern California\n\nUnderground costs can vary depending on trenching and paving. If gas and telephone utilities share costs with electric companies, conversion costs can come down, but it all comes out of the customer's pocket eventually.\n\nA report prepared by the Edison Electric Institute, \u201cOut of Sight, Out of Mind, An Updated Study on the Undergrounding of Overhead Power Lines,\u201d found that while most new commercial and residential developments across the United States tuck electrical facilities underground, burying existing above-ground electric distribution systems can cost up to $5 million a mile in urban areas.\n\nEnvironmental concerns would also be high if thousands of miles of trenches were dug through forests or brushland habitat, Borenstein noted. Opposition could also arise from residents in existing neighborhoods confronted with the prospect of heavy-duty earth-moving projects.", "description": "It would take more than 1,000 years to bury all the lines at the current rate.
