He then got back into the driver's seat, police told the New York Daily News.\n\nA witness said that authorities struggled as 'they were trying to pull the guy out,' with the sergeant having to use his Taser to try to get Feliz into submission.\n\nFeliz lurched the car forward and then put it in reverse as officers flanked the front seat, including the partially opened front door.\n\n'When the car was put into reverse, the officer on the driver's side had to release his grip on the male, and jump out of the way to avoid getting hit by the car,' said NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan.\n\nDuring the traffic stop, Feliz is said to have gotten out of the SUV and struggled with officers\n\nA different witness said Feliz tried to fend off the officers.\n\n'He was fighting with him [one of the officers], swinging at the cops,' explained the witness. 'And then there was a shot fired.'\n\nAccording to Monahan, the scuffle lasted roughly a minute and a half before the sergeant shot Feliz.\n\n'They were running up the street with him on a stretcher taking him directly to the ER. They were pumping his chest all the way. He wasn't responding. He looked like he died,' a woman at the scene said.\n\nAccording to Monahan, the scuffle lasted roughly a minute and a half before the sergeant shot Feliz\n\nFeliz was pronounced dead at St. Barnabas Hospital.\n\nPolice said Feliz possessed 'a substantial amount' of illegal drugs - including cocaine, heroin and molly.\n\n'He had a ton of narcotics on him and a lot of cash. We're still trying to figure out how much. We still have to search the vehicle,' a police source explained.\n\nMonahan said that Feliz had three warrants for violations, including one for littering.\n\nFeliz's brother, 29-year-old Sammy Feliz, said: 'He was a good father, brother, and uncle.He was a beautiful human being.'\n\n'He was probably afraid that he was being judged for his past. There has been an injustice done. This is truly a tragedy. We are all heartbroken.'", "description": "The man - identified by family as 31-year-old Allan Feliz - was pulled over by the officer on Bainbridge Avenue near East 211th Street in Bronx neighborhood of Bedford Park at around 3pm.", "authors": ["Matthew Wright For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/04/19868860-0-image-a-100_1571370605609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
