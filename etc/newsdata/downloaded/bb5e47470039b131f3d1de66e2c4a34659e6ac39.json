Others refused to scuttle the probe into Russian meddling in US politics. Senator Mitt Romney has usurped the former Ohio governor John Kasich as the party\u2019s most disapproving grandee.\n\nCongressional members have quit and invited the world to infer why. Trump was being challenged for the GOP nomination even before Ukraine-gate. Parts of the conservative ecosystem \u2014 think-tanks, journals \u2014 have bucked Trumpism and paid a toll in lost patrons.\n\nI am not suggesting another volume of Profiles in Courage here. But Profiles in Sheepish and Occasionally Effective Dissent would not struggle for case studies. In parts of the country, support for Trump is as bottomless as the hype implies. In Washington, it can be gossamer-thin.\n\nAside from any personal dislike of him, his two dearest projects \u2014 protectionism and lower immigration \u2014 jar with conservatives reared on laissez-faire. Some Republicans are even willing to put a number on the closeted apostates. Were the vote held in private, \u201cat least 35\u201d GOP senators would choose to convict the president, according to Jeff Flake, who was one of their number until January. They will not, of course, but the chances of a different and still lethal rebellion are underrated.\n\nWhat might cause it? Were public opinion to turn decisively for impeachment \u2014 the first polls merely lean that way \u2014 it would focus minds. Were Trump\u2019s behaviour to deteriorate, his staff would have to decide whether to risk ensnarement in the mess. What put the likes of Haldeman in jail was not Watergate itself but the efforts to cover it up. And that was under a president with some grounding in the rules. Trump, a neophyte in Washington, often appears sincerely dumbstruck by the illegality of certain actions.\n\nTrump must also do without his favourite recruiting sergeant. In 2016, hatred of Hillary Clinton enlisted wavering conservatives to his cause. Whichever Republican opposed her in the presidential election could count on almost inexhaustible forbearance from the right.\n\nThree years on, she is a non-factor. Perhaps conservatives can summon the same dread for the prospect of President Elizabeth Warren (who is some way to her left) or President Joe Biden. Otherwise, Trump cannot terrorise them into loyalty merely by brandishing the alternative.\n\nThe president\u2019s transactional world view always implied the possibility of his own abandonment. Once he stops being useful to people, by his own logic, they have no reason to stay loyal.\n\nHe does not offer a relationship much deeper than \u2014 what an airing this Latinism is getting \u2014 quid pro quo. For the time being, he still gives eminent Republicans something for their something. He electrifies a constituency they hardly understand. But they must now weigh this against a scandal that even the gamest loyalists among them are struggling to rebut. They must weigh it against the subpoenas being couriered ominously around Washington.\n\nWhether to support Trump is becoming a finer and finer calculation for Republicans. And calculation, not fraternity, is all it ever was. janan.ganesh@ft.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "The president\u2019s transactional world view always implied the possibility of his own abandonment.
