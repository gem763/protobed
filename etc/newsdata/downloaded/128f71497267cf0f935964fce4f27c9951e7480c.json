One by one, her proposals failed in the Senate: Medicare for all, free college, decriminalizing undocumented border crossing, even the wealth tax. Democratic senators from red states, she learned, were still from red states; embracing her agenda would have been suicidal. Warren and her aides didn\u2019t help. Fired by their sense of moral superiority, they were good at condemnation, not coalition-building.\n\nWhen the recession of 2021 hit, things got ugly. The failure of two consecutive presidencies had a devastating effect on American morale. It became evident that the nation had three political tendencies \u2014 conservative populism, progressive populism and moderate liberalism. None of them could put together a governing majority to get things done\u2026\n\nWith the Republicans powerless and irrelevant, the war within the Democratic Party grew vicious. Progressives detested moderate liberals even more than they did conservatives. The struggle came to a head with another set of Democratic primaries in 2024.\n\nThe moderate liberals triumphed easily. It turns out that the immigrant groups, by then a large and organized force in American politics, had not lost faith in the American dream, they had not lost faith in capitalism. They simply wanted more help so they could compete within it.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Brooks", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Elizabeth-Warren.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
