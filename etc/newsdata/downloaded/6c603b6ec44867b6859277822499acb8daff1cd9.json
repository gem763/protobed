Mr Scaramucci has become one of Mr Trump\u2019s most vocal critics since leaving the White House after a week-long stint as the director of communications.\n\nHe has been saying that the president\u2019s days are numbered for a while now and last night, he claimed Mr Trump was \u201cdone\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Mr Giuliani also got into a very heated argument with another guest on Ms Ingraham\u2019s show later in the evening.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Mr Trump\u2019s lawyer, had an extraordinary interview on Fox News last night in which he showed Laura Ingraham a phone that he claimed proves he was sent by the State Department to Ukraine.\n\nMr Giuliani has argued that he only spoke to Ukrainian officials because the State Department asked him to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outburst appears to be a warning to Trump administration officials who may want to blame him for the scandal.\n\nOne of the big questions for Democrats today is this \u2013 do Americans support an impeachment investigation? The good news for Ms Pelosi is they do, according to YouGov US, if Mr Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in order to incentivise an investigation into Mr Biden and his son. In that scenario, more than half (55 per cent) of Americans would back impeachment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the president denies those allegations and it is not clear at this point if Democrats will be able to prove them. The president has also put out a new set of Facebook ads to create an \"impeachment defence task force\", according to journalist Judd Legum. The adverts ask Mr Trump's supporters to defend \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\" by donating money to his campaign. Advertisement It is going to be a busy day. After months of resistance, Nancy Pelosi has finally come out in favour of an impeachment investigation into Donald Trump, setting off an angry and erratic stream of tweets from the president. To recap on what happened overnight\u2026 Mr Trump announced he would release the transcript of his call with Ukraine in an attempt to prove he did not threaten the country\u2019s president to investigate his main 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the whistleblower who reported the call apparently wants to testify before Congress.\n\nHello and welcome to The Independent's rolling coverage of the Donald Trump administration.\n\nMr Biden, who is also Mr Trump\u2019s main 2020 election rival, spoke out against the president\u2019s \u201cabuse of power\u201d last night and said if he refused to cooperate with the investigation, he would leave Congress with \u201cno choice but to initiate impeachment\u201d.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, Mr Trump's former press secretary, has claimed it is \"only a matter of time now\" before the president is gone.", "description": "A formal impeachment inquiry has been launched by Congress as\u00a0the scandal over Donald Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president deepened.", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/07/donald-trump-impeachment.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
