The British director recognises himself in the painting, as a younger man \u2013 but there is something not quite right.\n\n\u201cI look at the eyes and they terrify me,\u201d Jackson, now 75, tells BBC Culture. \u201cThey\u2019re completely haunted.\u201d\n\nJackson sat for the portrait shortly after he\u2019d finished making Threads, the nuclear war film. It premiered on the BBC on 23 September, 1984, which was described as \u201cthe night the country didn\u2019t sleep\u201d. According to Jackson, so immersive was his experience behind the camera that \u201cit took years to get out of my head\u201d.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Friends: The show that changed our idea of family\n\n- The best TV shows of 2019 so far\n\n- Why Top Boy is like nothing else on TV\n\nThreads was born out of an era of paranoia \u2013 the early 1980s. In 1983, US President Ronald Reagan had launched the Strategic Defense Initiative \u2013 also known as \u2018Star Wars\u2019 \u2013 a program designed to develop an anti-ballistic missile system to fend off a nuclear attack. In the same year, Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as an \u201cevil empire\u201d.\n\nAs tensions escalated between the US and the USSR, so speculation fomented that nuclear war was not so much a far-off nightmare, as an imminent possibility. Historians now compare those days of 1983 to the Cuban Missile Crisis two decades earlier as one of the most perilous episodes of the Cold War.\n\nOvercome by a sense of urgency, Jackson \u2013 then a documentary maker at the BBC \u2013 first set about producing an episode for science series QED, entitled A Guide to Armageddon. Jackson describes it as an \u201cunbiased, factual, emotionless piece of television\u201d that asked the simple question: what would happen to us in the event of a nuclear fallout?\n\nWhile viewers who caught A Guide to Armageddon may have well felt a sense of unease, it would little prepare them for Jackson\u2019s next project, given the green light in late 1983.\n\nKitchen sink realism\n\nThe opening scene of Threads is as unremarkable as it is familiar. We meet young lovers Ruth and Jimmy, canoodling in a car on the edge of the Peak District, UK. Chuck Berry plays on the radio, while they overlook their home city of Sheffield, whose state of repose \u2013 smoke gently wafts from a cooling tower \u2013 is all but a distant memory by the time the credits roll two hours later.\n\nWe soon learn that Ruth is pregnant, much to the consternation of both sets of parents, who hail from differing sides of the British class divide (Jimmy is working class, while Ruth is middle class). Yet the two are resolute they\u2019ll make a go of it and prepare to get married and settle down to start a family.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to conceive of a more brutal five minutes committed to film than what takes place around the 46-minute mark of Threads\n\nThese opening exchanges are indebted to the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s, best popularised on film by the director Ken Loach. Indeed, Threads was written by Barry Hines, who adapted one of his own novels into the script for Loach\u2019s 1969 masterpiece Kes. Hines was a proud Yorkshireman, and the dialogue in these first scenes \u2013 at the dinner table, the pub, the timber mill \u2013 carries all of his trademark ear for the demotic.\n\n\u201cBarry really knew how to write characters and human relationships,\u201d Karen Meagher, who played Ruth, tells BBC Culture. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in those first few scenes are ordinary people \u2013 real life. Everyone knows a Ruth or Jimmy.\u201d\n\nYet, while the people of Sheffield go about their everyday lives, television and wireless bulletins in the background carry news of growing tensions between the US and Soviet Union in Iran. At first, they are given short shrift, before it emerges that the situation is more serious than it first appeared. Soon, news reports of an imminent attack on the UK are front and centre. In the grip of panic, a siren wails and a four-minute warning is issued.\n\nAnd then it happens.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to conceive of a more brutal five minutes committed to film than what takes place around the 46-minute mark of Threads. In sheer terror, a woman urinates down her leg. It\u2019s only the beginning. Amid the thermonuclear blast that follows, windows smash; walls disintegrate; buildings crumble; human life melts as a firestorm engulfs Sheffield. The soundtrack to destruction is a rumble so distressing that it is comparable to an \u201cenormous door slamming in the depths of hell\u201d, as the noise of a nuclear explosion was described in Peter Watkins\u2019 similarly terrifying 1960s film The War Game.\n\nBut it is Threads\u2019 depiction of the subsequent nuclear winter that lingers long in the mind. Amid the scorched ruins, we follow Ruth\u2019s struggle for survival (her parents die soon after the blast while Jimmy is never seen again) in a post-apocalyptic world ridden by famine and disease. In the scramble for food \u2013 now civilisation\u2019s only currency \u2013 law and order collapses, eclipsed by anarchy and authoritarian rule.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t hold back, because to do so would have been to not tell the truth. People had to see it \u2013 Mick Jackson\n\nThis is a world in which the living envy the dead. In which hospitals, divested of the means to exercise proper care, carry out amputations on patients without anaesthetic. In which Ruth \u2013 having given birth to a daughter \u2013 is forced to trade her body for rats as a form of sustenance. Where children of the survivors of the apocalypse roam the land, mute due to there being no education system of which to speak.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of times during filming, where I thought: \u2018should I be making this?\u2019\u201d admits Jackson, who shot Threads over 17 days on a budget of just \u00a3250,000.\n\n\u201cBut I just tried to remember that this was my one chance of making a film like nothing people had ever seen before. We couldn\u2019t hold back, because to do so would have been to not tell the truth. People had to see it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Too horrifying for TV\u2019\n\nTalking to Jackson \u2013 who went onto enjoy Hollywood success, directing the 1992 blockbuster The Bodyguard \u2013 what is immediately impressive is his knowledge of his subject matter. In researching the potential impact of a nuclear fallout, he spent months meeting with scientists, doctors and defence specialists.\n\nOver the phone, he speaks with authority on everything from the history of arms control to the upcoming renewal of the New Start treaty \u2013 the only existing arms control pact between the US and Russia. \u201cSorry to be so wonkish about this dreadful stuff,\u201d he apologises at one point.\n\nBut if Threads hadn\u2019t had Jackson\u2019s eye for realism, it would surely have been to its detriment. Even the shoestring budget, which limited the makeup for burns victims to a mix of tomato ketchup and Rice Krispies cereal, does nothing to detract from the horror that unfolds.\n\n\u201cI suppose when you watch it now, you can see we didn\u2019t have a lot of money in certain scenes,\u201d Meagher laughs. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. It\u2019s about human condition, love and loss \u2013 that\u2019s what will always be important to people watching it, regardless.\u201d\n\nThreads isn\u2019t the only film from the time to represent destruction at the hands of a nuclear attack, but no other comes remotely close to its unremitting bleakness. In 1983, ABC broadcast The Day After, a television film, which, like Threads, imagines how a fallout impact would impact on ordinary Americans, leading ordinary lives on, seemingly, just another ordinary day. Substitute Sheffield for Kansas City and you have the same premise.\n\nBut, with its $7 million budget, and star cast \u2013 led by Jason Robards \u2013 The Day After packs not even half the punch of Threads. It\u2019s almost Disney-esque in comparison. If there is one nuclear war film to which Threads doffs its cap, it is the aforementioned The War Game (1965). A 46-minute docudrama produced for the BBC, the film was pulled due to being, as the broadcaster put it, \u201ctoo horrifying for the medium of broadcasting\u201d. A young Mick Jackson saw it at an independent screening on his college campus.\n\nFew who have seen Threads forget its impact. Toni Perrine, professor of film at Grand Valley State University, Michigan, recalls watching it shortly after it debuted on television in the US in 1985 (prefaced, unusually, by a personal introduction by TBS founder Ted Turner).\n\n\u201cI was pregnant with my second child at the time and Threads shook me to the core,\u201d says Perrine. \u201cI was literally nauseated by the final scene of the film.\u201d\n\nAt his home in a small village in Oxfordshire, a 13-year-old by the name of Charlie Brooker also watched Threads on the night of 23 September.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs last year, Brooker cited the film as a formative moment of his early adolescence. \u201cI remember watching Threads and not being able to process what it meant; not understanding how society kept going,\u201d he said. \u201cI assumed it [nuclear war] was going to happen.\u201d\n\nThere are clear parallels between Threads and Brooker\u2019s dystopian science fiction series Black Mirror. Both, in Brooker\u2019s words, are \u201cabout the way we live now \u2013 and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy\u201d. Mankind forever teeters on the brink \u2013 it\u2019s only our perception of this that alters.\n\nTowards the end of our interview, I ask Jackson to define Threads\u2019 genre. Is it a drama? Docudrama? Sci-fi? Horror?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s too bold to say this, but it is just Threads,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s its genre.\u201d\n\nLove TV?
