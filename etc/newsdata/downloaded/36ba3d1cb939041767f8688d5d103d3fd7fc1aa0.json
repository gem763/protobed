It's too much government intervention distorting incentives.\n\n\"Once you get an interest rate below a certain level, it doesn't stimulate the economy, but it does distort capital.\"\n\nFormer RBA board member Warwick McKibbin is worried about extreme monetary policy. Fairfax\n\nThe Australian National University economics professor cited the experience of Europe, where negative interest rates, central bank asset purchase programs and cheap lending to commercial banks have not returned the economy to pre-crisis health.\n\n\"There's a lot of evidence that by doing QE, firms are stopped from going out of business,\" he said.\n\n\"In Europe, in particular, there is capital trapped in badly poorly performing firms.\n\n\"One of the arguments why productivity growth is so low is that you stop the creative destruction process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"New firms can't get access to capital because old firms are holding the resources.\"\n\nProfessor McKibbin said the reduction in borrowing costs to ultra-low levels was making it very difficult for investors and business to estimate the appropriate rates of return on capital.\n\n\"You can't price risk because it's being manipulated by central banks,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there is long-term damage being done by low interest rates and QE.\"\n\nThe RBA has cut interest rates a quarter percentage point three times since June.\n\nMore rate cuts likely\n\nIts goal is to drive the jobless rate down to 4.5 per cent from the present 5.3 per cent to spur larger wage rises and nudge soft inflation from 1.6 per cent into the 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band.\n\nBefore cutting rates below 1 per cent, Dr Lowe said in August that deploying unorthodox measures was unlikely but possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome market economists are tipping the RBA to further cut the cash rate another quarter point to 0.5 per cent in coming months and to launch a QE program next year, unless the Morrison government relents on its budget surplus commitment and unleashes a fiscal stimulus.\n\nDr Lowe said recently if the RBA embarked on unorthodox monetary policy, buying government bonds to lower the \"risk-free\" interest rate to reduce borrowing rates across the economy would probably be the bank's preferred tool.\n\nHe said a \"package\" of measures would be most effective.\n\nThe BIS report led by Dr Lowe downplayed the effect on commercial banks' profits from negative central bank interest rates in jurisdictions such as Europe, Switzerland and Japan.\n\n\"Although side effects, such as the compression of bank interest margins, were detected, they have not posed a major problem for banking stability to date because of offsets from other sources of income and the eventual recovery of bank portfolio values, including the declines in non-performing loans,\" it said.\n\n\"That said, the potential longer-term effects of a prolonged period of negative rates on intermediaries cannot be fully assessed on the basis of current experience.\"\n\nCentral bank tools\n\nThe BIS's Committee on the Global Financial System, chaired by Dr Lowe, warned of some negative \"side effects\" such as near-zero rates compressing commercial bank profits, the inefficient allocation of credit, spillovers to other countries, and weakening the private sector's incentive to deleverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report also said too much reliance on unconventional central bank tools risked letting governments and businesses off the hook from making difficult reforms to deal with debt, an ageing population, financial innovation and globalisation.\n\nProfessor McKibbin pointed to a second BIS paper released on Tuesday, which reported other negative financial market side effects of QE, such as distorting the availability of government bonds.\n\nThe Basel, Switzerland-based BIS reviewed four tools employed by central banks since the 2008 global financial crisis; negative interest rates, central bank lending to commercial banks, purchases of financial assets such as government bonds and \"forward guidance\" pledges on stimulus by central bankers.\n\nDr Lowe said such instruments should be used as appropriate when central bank interest rates fall to the \"effective lower bound\".", "description": "Former RBA board member Warwick McKibbin says local banks and insurers would be among firms hurt by the RBA's cash rate fall to 0.75 per cent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.241%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d467d6f2ab9a51d85de5f4715689fd272aa1a2d0", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
