South Carolina had the largest month-over-month decline at 0.3 percentage point.\n\nOf those states, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Colorado all swung against President Donald Trump in the 2016 race against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Those areas could come into play during a contest next year in which the incumbent will play the strong economy against a looming impeachment from the House of Representatives.\n\nA study released earlier this week by Moody's Analytics forecast an easy Trump win should economic conditions remain relatively unchanged. Opinion polls, though, have him trailing the current Democratic front-runners in respective head-to-head matchups.\n\nThe national unemployment has fallen only marginally over the past 12 months, from 3.7% to the current level that is the lowest since December 1969.\n\nPayrolls increased significantly in three states during September, rising 8,200 in Kentucky, 4,600 in Idaho and 4,500 in Hawaii. Employment fell in only two states \u2014 Virginia (-14,700) and New Hampshire (-3,500).\n\nFor the 12-month period, California experienced the largest payroll gains at 320,000 followed by Texas (300,000) and perennial swing state Florida (224,700). No states reported payroll losses.\n\nThe lowest unemployment rate in the country belongs to Vermont at 2.2%, while Alaska is the highest with 6.2%.", "description": "Alabama (3%), California (4%), Illinois (3.9%), New Jersey (3.1%) and South Carolina (2.9%) set all-time bottoms in data that goes back to 1976.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106019712-1563213504686rts2jijg.jpg?v=1563213583", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
