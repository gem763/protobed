In this situation the person who might need honesty the most is you\n\nRecently I moved to a new city. I\u2019ve met some lovely people, though it\u2019s hard past a certain age to make new close friends, rather than just friendly acquaintances. However, there is one person who I have become close friends with over the past year. When she introduced me to her wider, fairly new social group I was made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable by them. My friend seems oblivious to this and keeps inviting me to join them on social outings. Should I explain to her that I would like to be her friend only, and risk causing a drama, or just keep quiet and hope she doesn\u2019t perceive my distance as being flaky or uninterested in her friendship?\n\nIt\u2019s one of the oldest ethical questions: how much do I really need to tell the truth about? If you\u2019re frank with this new friend, and you tell her you can\u2019t stand the company she keeps, you risk alienating her and losing her as well as them. But if you\u2019re not honest enough, and just mysteriously have to wash your hair every time they hang out, you risk seeming anti-social and ungrateful for the invitation. It\u2019s a social quagmire, right after you relocated, when what you probably want most is solid ground.\n\nHere\u2019s a question that might help: do you owe anyone the truth here? Her, or for that matter, yourself?\n\nSome ethicists take our obligations to the truth very seriously, in which case this isn\u2019t a pragmatic question about how to keep your friendship, it\u2019s not even a question. You just have to tell the truth. Could this be the situation?\n\nLet\u2019s start with whether you owe her the truth. Usually your gut knows, but here are some thoughts to get it metabolising the question. What was it about them that made you uncomfortable? Were they harmful in some way, that they\u2019ll keep being until someone calls them out? Rude, sexist, racist? Did they do something you think is genuinely morally objectionable, or was it just that they like beer and you like wine and cheese?\n\nIt\u2019s OK for people not to get on. We all have facets of ourselves that we rotate into different configurations like a Rubik cube depending on what the occasion is and who we\u2019re around. Your friend, if she\u2019s a grown-up human, already understands that. That means that if it isn\u2019t a serious moral issue you need to speak up about, you can subtly communicate \u201cI like you, but not them\u201d in a less awkward way than a sit-down, out-loud conversation. You\u2019re not introducing her to a brand new idea. She\u2019ll get it. And doing that doesn\u2019t need to be flaky. Real friendship lives in the gesture; the sustained attention we pay each other when we think life goes better with the other person around. You can find your own ways of showing her that.\n\nBut what if there\u2019s a truth you owe yourself? I wonder whether you\u2019re privately worried about how much you really know this person, if she likes people who abrade you so much. Maybe her failure to notice your discomfort made you worry that she\u2019s not as thoughtful of you as you are of her.\n\nI think it would help to be as honest with yourself as possible about exactly what made you uncomfortable. Friendship matters. Finding people we love and hanging on to them may be the only thing that matters. It can be hard to acknowledge the difference between \u201cgood company\u201d and \u201ca real friend\u201d. If you\u2019re secretly worried that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, really ask the question of yourself.\n\n*************************************\n\nAsk us a question\n\nDo you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?
