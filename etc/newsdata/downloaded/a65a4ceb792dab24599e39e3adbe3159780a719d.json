A verdict form showed the jury was split, 11-1, in favor of conviction on those charges.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Manafort ultimately admitted to all the allegations in both federal cases, but a judge dismissed the 10 hung counts last October.\n\nNormally, a defendant could be retried following a mistrial caused by a hung jury, but Manafort\u2019s lawyers handling the New York case say any federal prosecution that goes to trial \u2014 even if it results in a hung jury \u2014 triggers the state\u2019s law against double jeopardy and forbids a state prosecution for the same offense.\n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s double jeopardy statute is clear that \u2018it is the fact of the prior prosecution, not the result, which triggers the statutory protection,\u2019\u201d Manafort\u2019s lead attorney, Todd Blanche, wrote.\n\nThe overlap between the 16-count state indictment and the earlier federal charges against Manafort remains unclear, but it appears that most or all of the charges involve events detailed in the federal case against the longtime international political consultant and lobbyist.\n\nVance\u2019s office has yet to put forward detailed legal arguments defending the state indictment, which includes charges of residential mortgage fraud, falsifying business records and scheming to defraud. However, prosecutors are expected to argue that a mistrial due to a hung jury simply doesn\u2019t count as a prior federal prosecution under the New York anti-double jeopardy law.\n\nUnder a legal theory known as \u201cdual sovereigns,\u201d the U.S. Supreme Court has long permitted states to charge defendants already charged in federal court and vice versa. In June, the justices voted, 7-2, to reject the latest case challenging that doctrine.\n\nHowever, states are free to pass laws limiting their own prosecutors from initiating criminal cases related to crimes already prosecuted at the federal level.\n\nNo trial date has been set on the New York state charges against Manafort.", "description": "Special counsel Robert Mueller brought similar charges against the former Trump campaign in federal court last year.", "authors": ["Josh Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7e/ed/85428adb4dd0adf9a26560620beb/20190905-paul-manafort-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
