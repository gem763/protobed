(AP) - Kyler Murray seeemed to take another step in his progression as a pro in the first half against Carolina, fitting passes in tight windows and showing off his speed on designed runs.\n\nOnce the second half rolled around, Arizona\u2019s quarterback looked shaky against the Panthers\u2019 pressure, throwing two interceptions and numerous other off-target passes.\n\nAnd Murray wasn\u2019t even the Cardinals\u2019 biggest problem.\n\nTheir defense was dismal in the desert.\n\nTaking a step back from their first two games under coach Kill Kingsbury, the Cardinals allowed backup Kyle Allen to throw for four touchdowns and Christian McCaffrey to run for 153 yards in a 38-20 loss to the Panthers on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe physicality, some of that was just embarrassing,\u201d Cardinals nose tackle Corey Peters said. \u201cThey ran the ball, they passed the ball, so completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s defense struggled early with Allen\u2019s pinpoint passing.\n\nPressed into starting with Cam Newtown (foot) injured, Murray\u2019s former Texas A&M; teammate picked apart his current team, hitting 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards.\n\nArizona\u2019s secondary, missing Patrick Peterson (suspension) and Robert Alford (injured), repeatedly left Carolina\u2019s receivers open, including DJ Moore on a 52-yard touchdown just before halftime. The Cardinals\u2019 defensive front, after getting some early pressure on Allen, didn\u2019t help the secondary by giving him plenty of time to throw.\n\n\u201cWe take a lot of pride in getting after quarterbacks and getting after it,\u201d Cardinals linebacker Jordan Hicks said. \u201cWe just go to do a better job.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 big problem, as it has all year, was stopping the tight end.\n\nGreg Olsen continually found gaps in Arizona\u2019s coverage, catching seven passes for 75 yards and a pair of touchdowns. This after Detroit\u2019s T.J. Hockenson had six catches for 131 yards and a TD, and Baltimore\u2019s Mark Andrews caught eight passes for 112 yards and a score.\n\n\u201cWe have to get that cleaned up,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cThat\u2019s three weeks in a row that we weren\u2019t able to slow down the tight ends. They\u2019re premier players, but still we\u2019ve got to do a better job with that.\u201d\n\nThe run defense wasn\u2019t much better.\n\nThe Cardinals (0-2-1) kept McCaffrey mostly in check in the first half, but when they focused on stopping the passing game, the former Stanford running back took advantage with some big runs. His 76-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter put Carolina (1-2) up 28-20.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have that happen, clearly, but there was plenty of game left and the way this team has responded the past couple weeks, I felt like we would respond again,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOnce Allen hit Olsen on a 3-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, Arizona had to change its offensive game plan.\n\nThe Cardinals had some early success on the ground, particularly Murray on designed runs and scrambles. That opened up the short-passing game for Murray, who hit 18 of 22 passes for 95 yards and two touchdowns in the first half. He also ran six times for 32 yards.\n\nFalling behind by two touchdowns forced Arizona to become one dimensional. Forced to pass for any chance at a comeback, the Cardinals played right into the hands of the Panthers, who ramped up their pass rush and sat back in a zone to prevent big plays.\n\nCarolina sacked Murray eight times for 46 yards in losses and had him throwing on the run most of the second half.\n\n\u201cI think we can move the ball regardless, it just got predictable at the end,\u201d said Murray, who finished with 173 yards and two touchdowns, going 30 of 43. \u201cThey were pinning their ears back and got to me a couple of times.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals had no answer and now head into next week\u2019s game against Seattle still searching for their first win.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyler Murray seeemed to take another step in his progression as a pro in the first half against Carolina, fitting passes in tight windows and showing off his speed on designed runs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/panthers_cardinals_football_81501_c0-149-3585-2239_s1770x1032.jpg?aa9bbfadc02f01371c8436ff1a97ab12cb1a8ccc", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
