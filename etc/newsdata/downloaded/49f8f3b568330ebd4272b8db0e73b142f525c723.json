Photo: Getty Images\n\nWhat is the best way to transport a small child\u2019s weight in cake mix from point A to point B? You could ship it, which presumably gives you the added benefit of being able to declare or indicate your parcel\u2019s contents upfront. (Boring, predictable.) You could pack it into a car and drive it, or have some sort of delivery service do the job. (Ho hum.) Or! You could parcel it out into a bunch of plastic bags and cram them into a suitcase. That\u2019s always an option \u2014 albeit one that might get you flagged as an attempted drug trafficker. But hey, gimme danger.\n\nPurezza, a vegan pizzeria in the U.K., went the luggage route in attempting to move some 25 bags of product through Gatwick Airport, near London. According to the Guardian, the British Transport Police thought they had a \u201chuge drugs bust\u201d on their hands, intercepting a roller bag full of white powder around 1:30 p.m. local time on August 28.\n\n@BTPSussex huge drugs bust at Gatwick airport. In collaboration with @ukhomeoffice powders tested and discovered to be vegan cake ingredients. Please label your foods and bring samples of cakes next time you visit. #cakefine pic.twitter.com/tmyuOI5rLw \u2014 BTP Sussex (@BTPSussex) August 28, 2019\n\nHad the powder actually been narcotic, it may have qualified as the most brazen smuggling attempt since that time a man glued a half-kilo of coke to his head, threw on a toupee, and hit the tarmac. But after the BTP and the Home Office ran tests on the substance, they discovered it was just dairy-free cake mix. \u201cPlease label your foods and bring samples of cake next time you visit,\u201d BTP Sussex tweeted, along with a photo of the (you must admit) suspiciously packaged haul. And according to Metro, Purezza has gamely promised the whole of the BTP (or at least the Sussex arm) \u201ca slab of cake\u201d next time they\u2019re in Brighton, home to one of the pizza purveyor\u2019s two locations.\n\nAll in all, just an innocent little mix-up that could happen to anyone. Everyone knows that drugs hide in cheese now, anyway.\n\nStay in touch.
