REUTERS/Stephen Lam/Files\n\nThe United States, Britain and Australia signed an open letter earlier in the day calling for Facebook to suspend its encryption plan, saying it would hinder the fight against child abuse and terrorism.\n\nZuckerberg, speaking in a livestream of the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A session, said he had been aware of child exploitation risks before announcing his encryption plan and acknowledged that it would reduce tools to fight the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing an employee question about online child abuse, Zuckerberg acknowledged that losing access to the content of messages would mean \u201cyou\u2019re fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back.\u201d\n\nBut he said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems using the same tools it used to fight election interference, like patterns of activity and links between accounts on different platforms.\n\nHe also suggested the company might further limit the ways adults can interact with minors on Facebook\u2019s platforms.\n\nZuckerberg announced his plan to pivot the company toward more private forms of communication in March, capping months of internal debate over the merits of encryption, three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.\n\nInside the company, privacy engineers and others eager to shed the legacy of the Cambridge Analytica scandal saw the move as a win, as did product managers watching the steady uptick of growth at Facebook\u2019s encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.\n\nBut members of Facebook\u2019s safety team familiar with the child exploitation risks argued against the plan, raising deep concerns through the group\u2019s leaders and in large company meetings with senior executives, the sources said.\n\nThe United States, Britain and Australia said in their joint letter that they had engaged with Facebook on the issue, but that the company had not committed to addressing their \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the impact of its proposals.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children also met with Zuckerberg and other senior leaders of Facebook, who offered assurances that child safety was important to them.", "description": "Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg defended on Thursday his decision to encrypt the company's messaging services, despite concerns about its impact on child exploitation and other criminal activity.", "authors": ["Katie Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436869184&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9301E", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
