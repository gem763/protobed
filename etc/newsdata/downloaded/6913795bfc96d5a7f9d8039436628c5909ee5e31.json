They both managed to calm down after a few minutes, but still have been rattled by the experience.\n\nAja Hauff\n\nWhen the home inspector came, she was told that the tree's base looked to be rotting so the fall could have been a mix of deterioration and weather. It was windy and rainy when the tree fell.\n\nHauff has since been staying with her mother-in-law ever since, and she doesn't anticipate returning to the home anytime soon because of the extensive damage.\n\n\"It's gonna need more than just roof fixing,\" she said.", "description": "A Washington woman and her baby narrowly escaped a fallen tree that crashed through her home.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hauff-home-01-ht-jef-191009_hpMain_v12x5_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
