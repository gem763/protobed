Unfortunately, a beauty contest won't be one of them. With its single-tone finish and protruding rear camera, it's looking far less attractive than the average flagship smartphone.\n\nJust when you thought it was unlikely to get any worse, a new leak has revealed a hideous orange/coral colour scheme. Here are the photos.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 will come in a bright coral orange, according to an alleged photo leaked on Chinese social media app, Weibo, and reported by Android Central.\n\nImage: Weibo\n\nThe Google Pixel releases have always come in three colours but dare I say, none so bold. The Pixel 3 came in standard black and white as well as a light shade of pastel pink. Before that, some came in 'Kinda Blue', a greyish-blue shade, as well as 'Really Blue', a similarly daring royal blue.\n\nPreviously, it was anticipated the third colour might be a much more subtle mint green, according to Forbes. But if the leak turns out to be true, Google is going for a bold 2019 look. It's called fashion darlings, look it up.\n\nSpecs-wise, it's rumoured to be a beast. While the battery is a little lower than we hoped, both the Pixel 4 and its larger sibling, the XL, is expected to feature a Snapdragon 855 chip and 6-gigabytes of RAM with a 64-gigabyte or 128-gigabyte option available.\n\nRumoured Specs Pixel 4 Pixel 4 XL RAM 6 GB 6 GB Display 5.7-inch OLED with Full HD+, 90Hz 6.3-inch OLED with Quad HD+, 90Hz CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip Storage/Memory 64/128 GB 64/128 GB Battery 2800 mAh 3700 mAh Camera 12MB with phase-detect auto-focus, 16MB telephoto lens 12MB with phase-detect auto-focus, 16MB telephoto lens\n\nThe Google Pixel 4 is expected to be announced in October.", "description": "The Google Pixel 4 is sure to win a bunch of industry awards at the end of the year.
