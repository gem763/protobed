Small, light, rechargeable: lithium ion batteries have revolutionised our world in less than three decades.\n\nOn Wednesday, John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino, the inventors of a technology taken for granted by most, got the most prestigious chemistry nod of all: a Nobel Prize.\n\n\u201cThey created a rechargeable world,\u201d stated the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the accolade.\n\n\u2013 What\u2019s the big deal? \u2013\n\nOnly commercialised in 1991, lithium ion batteries now power millions upon millions of cellphones, laptops, tablets, cameras, hearing aids, pacemakers, solar panels, scooters, bikes and even long-distance electric cars.\n\n\u201cOver two thirds of the world\u2019s population own a mobile device be it a smartphone, a laptop or tablet, and nearly all powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. They are the hidden workhorses of the mobile era,\u201d Paul Coxon of the University of Cambridge\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy told AFP.\n\nThey have considerably boosted human mobility, and allowed millions in developing countries to access information and services online with just a mobile phone.\n\nLithium-ion batteries have also reduced our reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels, especially in electric cars.\n\nFurthermore, they can be used in combination with renewable but fluctuating energy sources such as the Sun or wind, capturing and storing energy to be re-used later.\n\nFor Coxon, the lithium ion battery is a worthy Nobel recipient as it plays to the very origins of the prestigious prize.\n\n\u201cThe practical application of science for the benefit of humanity; fundamental science placed directly into your hand,\u201d he said. \u201cI am literally holding a phone in my hand right now.\u201d\n\n\u2013 What changed? \u2013\n\nUnlike their predecessor, lead acid batteries developed in the mid-19th century, li-ion batteries are rechargeable.\n\nThey are smaller, lighter, longer lasting and can be made to be more powerful.\n\nElectric car batteries \u201cno longer weigh two tonnes but 300 kilogrammes (660 pounds),\u201d said Sara Snogerup Linse, a professor in physical chemistry and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\n\n\u2013 How do they work? \u2013\n\nWhen a battery is connected to a circuit, charged ions move inside the battery, usually in a chemical solution, between two electrodes \u2014 an anode and a cathode.\n\nChemical reactions take place at each of the electrodes, creating a buildup of electrons on one end. The electrons seek to rebalance, but cannot move through the battery, forcing them to travel through the circuit, giving off electric energy.\n\nThe positive electrode is made from a composite of lithium \u2014 the lightest metal known to man and the key to the design\u2019s success, according to Olof Ramstroem, a fellow committee member.\n\n\u201cLithium has such enormously attractive properties and that means you can get a very lightweight battery that is small with high power and efficiency,\u201d he said after Wednesday\u2019s announcement in Stockholm.\n\n\u201cLithium is very reactive\u2026 which is what we need \u2014 we need the electrons from the lithium. This is all about trying to tame that and get it into that small battery package that is really useful to us.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The downside \u2013\n\nAn article published in the journal Nature last July warned that reserves of raw materials used in lithium ion batteries such as cobalt and nickel, are scarce and expensive and fast running out.\n\nLithium is found in a range of minerals and in salt or brine, while production of the electrodes require rare metals such as cobalt and nickel.\n\n\u201cWe could not necessarily have predicted 40 or 50 years ago that tantalum, indium, all these interesting elements would become very important,\u201d said Coxon, pointing to environmental harms and stresses on infrastructure in places where the minerals are found \u2014 especially in South America.\n\n\u201cIt places pressure on how we ethically source these.\u201d\n\nLarge quantities of spent lithium ion battery components end up in landfills, he added. They are frequently shipped off to recycling facilities, often in developing countries, where they are stripped to their base parts and the reusable bits recycled.\n\n\u201cIt is a very important environmental challenge,\u201d said Coxon.\n\nAdded Maeva Philippot, an electrical engineering researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Brussels: \u201cRecycling will become more important as we have more and more batteries reaching the end of their lives.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Looking ahead \u2013\n\nScientists and engineers around the world are working to make li-ion batteries even smaller, longer lasting, quicker to charge and less volatile.\n\nThey are known to overheat and sometimes even explode, and are relatively expensive to produce, particularly due to the high cost of nickel and cobalt.\n\n\u201cThere are new chemistries that are coming that will allow us to make even smaller batteries,\u201d said Philippot.\n\nAs for recycling: \u201cEurope is making a new directive for batteries at the end of their lives and how they could be recycled and reused in other devices.\n\n\u201cFor instance, electric vehicle batteries could be used at home to store energy at home and be charged by solar panels. There are many projects looking at the \u2018second life\u2019 or re-use of batteries.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 They are omnipresent and essential to navigating modern life.
