Sixteen of the original 22 research centres have now been dissolved or are on an indefinite \u201chiatus\u201d. This was in defiance of instructions from Congress, which had approved $12.5m of federal funding for the cooperatives.\n\nWeather blackout\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s government has refused to publicise dozens of studies from the US Department of Agriculture that examine the impact of the climate crisis. Agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, has previously expressed scepticism about climate change, believing it to simply be due to \u201cweather patterns\u201d.\n\nClimate censorship\n\nIn June, it was reported that the White House had tried to stop Dr Rod Schoonover, a senior intelligence analyst, from discussing climate change when delivering congressional testimony. The reason given was that the science was not aligned with the views of the Trump administration.\n\nShort-term approach\n\nJames Reilly, the director of the US Geological Survey (USGS), has ordered that scientific assessments produced by USGS use climate models that only track the possible impact of climate change until 2040, rather than until the end of the century, as they had done previously. The second half of the century is likely to see the most dramatic impacts of global heating.", "description": "How the US president is at odds with scientists and their work", "authors": ["Emily Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27152055fa2ad77e6f66b9ba238ff1a068f58e4d/0_197_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6656ae5904afc6c0cf120092018c3d73", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
