That trust has gone.\n\n\"You are struggling to understand yourself, that someone you had so much respect, devotion and admiration for and still do, that you could intend to take their own life.\"\n\nThe court heard Mrs May was seeking a divorce but as of March this year he was yet to agree.\n\nOf her account to the jury, the judge said she had been \"brave, fair and objective\".\n\nA victim personal statement written in March this year by Mrs May, who was not in court for the sentencing hearing, was read out on Friday before her husband was jailed.\n\nShe spoke of how her dreams of spending the rest of her life with her husband and having children together had been shattered that day.\n\nMrs May revealed how she had been left traumatised as she described herself as \"merely existing\" and often felt it would \"be better\" if she had died that day.\n\nShe wrote: \"My life is not the same, I'm not the same and I don't think I ever will be.\"\n\nShe told how she is still in physical pain and she intended to get a divorce and sell the home where the attack happened.\n\nMrs May wrote: \"I cannot remain married to him. It doesn't mean all the feelings I have for him are gone. We did have six years together. But I cannot guarantee my safety with him.\n\n\"This event has completely changed my life. I feel my life has stopped. We were meant to spend the rest of our lives together. We were going to have children together.\n\n\"At this moment in time I cannot see how I will ever get those things in my life.\n\n\"Most of my friends are on that journey and while I am happy for them I cannot feel anything but immense sadness for the life I have lost.\n\n\"I'm often told by friends and family that I'm so brave or doing so well. This can't be further from the truth.\n\n\"I do a very good job of appearing strong but in reality I lack any real feelings. I feel empty. I am unsure if I will ever feel true happiness or love ever again.\n\n\"I often think it would have been better if I were killed. It would be so much easier not to be here to face people, to see the pity and sorrow in their eyes.\n\n\"This is quickly followed by an immense amount of guilt. I shouldn't feel like that but I can't help it.\"\n\nThe trial heard that Mrs May was lucky to have survived.\n\nAlthough no bone, organ or vital blood vessels were penetrated, the blade was close to both a carotid artery and jugular vein.\n\nThe couple had been together for six years at the time of the murder bid at their home.\n\nMrs May, who works in a school, told the trial they enjoyed a good relationship and did not argue, other than \"to bicker over the washing up\".\n\n\"We really loved each other,\" she added.\n\nJust five days earlier, they had returned from South Korea, where they had attended the wedding of Mrs May's brother.\n\nShe said the early morning knife attack was \"totally unexpected and a complete shock\".\n\nAt one stage Mrs May had even asked her husband if she would like his gift and quizzed him as to what it might be.\n\nGiving evidence for the prosecution, she told the court: \"I said to him 'this had better be a puppy' because we had talked about having one but he said 'it's not a puppy'.\n\n(Image: Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n\"Then it was just silent and I suddenly felt a pressure on my shoulder. I thought an animal had been thrown on me, something was clawing at me.\n\n\"I was screaming 'I can't get it off, I can't get it off'. I must have reached up there at some point and realised there was nothing there, no animal.\n\n\"But there was something rectangular in there. I thought it was a clamp or some kind of Halloween prop because I could feel blood trickling down.\n\n\"I said 'this isn't real' and he said 'this is real'. He was calm.\"\n\nThe court heard the couple had been to work on October 8 and shared a takeaway pizza while watching TV that evening.\n\nMrs May woke about 5am the next day to her husband coming into the bedroom, saying he had heard a noise downstairs.\n\nThey then became intimate before May told his wife he had a present for her and to close her eyes.\n\nHe then carried out the attack.\n\nMay told his wife he had been fired from work the previous day after his boss had discovered he had used the company account to order personal goods from Amazon.\n\nHe then drove his wife to the A&E department at the nearby Pembury Hospital where Mrs May, unaware how seriously she was injured, told staff she had tripped and fallen onto a knife.\n\nHowever, when her account was challenged by a doctor she broke down in tears, and May was arrested when police arrived.\n\nHe has since been diagnosed with a personality disorder brought on by the shame of losing his job.\n\nAfter May was jailed, Kent Police PC Mark Beeching, the investigating officer, said: \"May acted in a cold, callous and violent manner on that morning.\n\n\"The assault with a knife could have easily had fatal consequences and will no doubt have a long-lasting and profound effect on the victim.\n\n\"I would like to commend the victim for her assistance throughout the investigation and trial.\"", "description": "Shaun May told his wife Laura he had \"a present\" for her and covered her eyes with a tea towel before plunging a kitchen knife between her shoulder and neck - narrowly missing her jugular vein - at home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent", "authors": ["Julia Roberts", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Kent Police", "Alamy Stock Photo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652540.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_image-10.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
