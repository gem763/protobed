I believe that will be helpful.\n\nMr Grieve took the seat in 2017 for the Tories with a majority of 24,543 from Labour in second, but lost the party whip last month\n\nJo Swinson's party has moved to backing overtly back reversing the 2016 referendum result if it wins the next election\n\n'I have also had supportive emails from people who voted Labour in 2017.'\n\nMr Grieve was one of 21 Tory MPs who lost the party whip last month after voting for the Benn Act, which ties Boris Johnson's hands over Brexit.\n\nHe had also been threatened with de-selection by his local party over his attempts to soften Brexit.\n\nThe proposed free run for a sole Remain candidate comes after a similar plan was enacted for the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election.\n\nThe Green party and Plaid Cymru did not run, allowing the Lib Dem Jane Dodds to take the seat from expenses cheat Tory Chris Davies in August.\n\nA Lib Dem spokesman said that the decision in Beaconsfield was still in the balance.\n\n'Given our commitment to stop Brexit, we are working to make sure we have the maximum number of Remainers in Parliament.\n\n'In most places that will be the Liberal Democrats. So, it's fair to say that there are a lot of these discussions happening across the country. In this instance, as with other seats, it's too early to say an agreement is a done deal.'", "description": "The former attorney general, now an independent, says he will run in his Beaconsfield seat in a vote expected this side of Christmas shaping up to be a Brexit v Remain battle.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/11/19358016-0-image-a-26_1570356327122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
