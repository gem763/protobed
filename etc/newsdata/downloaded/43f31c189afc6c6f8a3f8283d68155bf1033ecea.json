Jones, a political science professor at Rice University.\n\n\u201cNo one is really talking about border security or a compromised balanced approach where some people are deported and some people are not deported,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cEveryone is taking a very sympathetic, almost open borders approach.\u201d\n\nIt underscores how Democrats have moved to the left on immigration, while Mr. Trump and Republicans move to the right \u2014 setting up a likely flashpoint in the general election.\n\nThe 2020 Democrats on Thursday are likely to field questions regarding their plans to stop mass shootings in the wake of deadly shootings in El Paso and Odessa, to reduce greenhouse gases in a city where the fossil fuel industry drives the economy and to expand health care in a state with the most uninsured people in the nation.\n\nImmigration, though, is perhaps the most polarizing issue in the border state of Texas, which is home to a burgeoning Hispanic community and has been ground zero for the implementation of Trump administration policies that have triggered debates over \u201ckids in cages,\u201d restrictions on asylum seekers and whether are not immigrants are more of an asset or a threat to the nation.\n\nAmplifying the issue at the debate will be moderator Jorge Ramos, an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision who champions for illegal immigrants and is a vocal critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s border policies.\n\nThat could provide an opening for Mr. Castro, who is among the lowest polling candidates to qualify for the Houston.\n\nMr. Castro, 44, a former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing in the Obama administration, has made softening immigration law a cornerstone of his campaign. He was the first major candidate to roll out an immigration plan and upped the ante for his rivals by calling for the decriminalization of border crossings.\n\nThe move put him at odds with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, the undisputed front-runner in the Democratic race.\n\nIt also led to a headline-grabbing clash in the June debate when he called out former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a fellow Texas Democrat, for refusing to adopt his push to do away with Section 1325, an obscure part of the nation\u2019s immigration law that makes jumping the border a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail.\n\nMr. Castro got a bounce from the performance.\n\nAfterward, a Univision poll found that 65% of registered Hispanic voters said they would be more likely to vote in favor of Democrats that backed Mr. Castro\u2019s stance and that Mr. Castro had the best immigration plan by far.\n\nThat helps explain why Mr. O\u2019Rourke went on damage control after the debate, seeking to assure immigration activists that he was on their side by traveling to the southern border.\n\nMr. Castro continued to rise in another Univision poll released this week that showed he was the top choice of 12% of Hispanic voters nationwide \u2014 a third-place finish behind Mr. Biden at 22% and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont at 20%.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Julian Castro having a good couple of months since the first debate,\u201d Matt Barreto, co-founder of Latino Decisions, said in a conference call this week. \u201cHe has continued to campaign very vigorously, so I think his name ID is beginning to increase with Latinos.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be very important for him in this debate to see if he can continue that, continue that strong performance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 Seth McLaughlin reported from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
