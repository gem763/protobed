That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\"\n\nBobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat, tweeted to Mr Trump: \"What the hell is wrong with you?\"\n\n\"Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you.\"\n\nHe called on Mr Trump to delete the tweet.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What happened this week in Trump's impeachment saga?\n\nWhat's the latest with the impeachment inquiry?\n\nThe inquiry is examining whether the Republican president abused his office by improperly pressuring Ukraine to launch an investigation into former US Vice-President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nMr Trump denies holding up US military aid to Ukraine so they would investigate Mr Biden's son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nOn Tuesday, veteran US diplomat William Taylor - the acting US ambassador to Ukraine - is scheduled to be interviewed by the impeachment committees at Congress.\n\nTexts show Mr Taylor raised the alarm to other Trump officials about withholding US aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Mr Taylor wrote in one message.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday, Mr Trump called for his party \"to get tougher and fight\" the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight, because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican party before the election,\" he said.\n\nQuick facts on impeachment\n\nImpeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office\n\nIf the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial\n\nA Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber\n\nOnly two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed\n\nPresident Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached", "description": "The president condemns the investigation as \"without due process or fairness or any legal rights\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/107F4/production/_109327576_gettyimages-1177524157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
