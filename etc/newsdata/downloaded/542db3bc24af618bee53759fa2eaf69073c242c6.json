Alternatively, AEMO then has to determine what reserves are needed. That means we are making a decision for the market, rather than the market making the decision.\"\n\nMs Zibelman said the RERT was not a long-term solution for the NEM.\n\n\"What is clear is us going out every summer, trying to buy supply over a short period of time is the most expensive way to go about it,\" she said.\n\n\"It's like trying to buy an insurance policy when you're already at the hospital. It's not a good idea. It's not feasible, it's dangerous and it's expensive.\"\n\nAustralian Energy Regulator Jim Cox said regulators were not sitting on their hands when it came to dealing with the energy crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Regulators aren't perfect, but we are aware of the challenges,\" he said.\n\nAustralian Energy Market Commission commissioner Merryn York said the AEMC and AEMO had been focusing on system security, but it was a juggle to deal with the raft of new rule changes.\n\n\"We're trying to balance things and speed up the rule changes,\" she said.\n\n\"We are constantly getting new bits of kit to deal with, such as distributed energy resources. It's a natural thing that the rules will continue to expand. We do need to ensure we have arrangements which support investment, both in the long term and the short term.\"\n\nMs York acknowledged market intervention wasn't ideal, but says the usual price signals \u2013 like high forward contract prices \u2013 were not encouraging investment.\n\n\"It is not actually happening despite there being signals that in normal circumstances would have driven investment,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to move beyond energy reserves \u2013 they are for emergency \u2013 and we need to drive investment.\"\n\nGilbert + Tobin special counsel Geoff Petersen said the National Electricity Rules currently went to 1600 pages and had served the market well \u2013 up until now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But it may be rules and the institutional framework needs to become more agile,\" he said.\n\nEnergy Consumers Australia chief executive Rosemary Sinclair was more scathing, saying regulators were often part of the problem in solving Australia's energy woes.\n\n\"The energy sector has delivered poorly. One of the problems in this sector is the solution often seems to be throw more capacity at it in the knowledge that some consumer somewhere is going to pay for it,\" Ms Sinclair said.\n\nShe said consumers were angry about soaring power prices and shouldn't be punished for installing solar panels or batteries to take control of their power problems.\n\n\"We are at the very beginning of trying to deal with demand management,\" she said.", "description": "Australian Energy Market Operator chief executive Audrey Zibelman said markets not government was the key to more investment in the sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2687%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_218%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f8c81f964c20da027e173deab1b9c03a2fa01a6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
