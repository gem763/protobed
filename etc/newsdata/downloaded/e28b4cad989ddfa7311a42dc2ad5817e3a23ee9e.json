Hill said claims that she was in a relationship with her legislative director are \"absolutely false.\"\n\n\"This is what needs to happen so that the good people who supported me will no longer be subjected to the pain inflected by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation,\" Hill said in her Sunday statement.\n\nWho's out in 2020: More than a dozen Republicans are leaving Congress. Here are the lawmakers who aren't running again in 2020\n\nLater, Hill tweeted: \"To every girl and woman - to everyone who believes in this fight - this isn\u2019t over.\"\n\nHill and her husband are going through a divorce.\n\nThe allegation of Hill's relationship with one of her staffers was first published by conservative website RedState.com.

Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Ranking Member Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAllegations: House committee opens investigation into allegations Rep.
