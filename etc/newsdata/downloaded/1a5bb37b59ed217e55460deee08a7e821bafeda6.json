Marvin Johnson\u2019s superb low free-kick from the right was flicked goalwards by Paddy McNair; Schofield reacted brilliantly to save from close range, but the rebound appeared a formality for Ashley Fletcher. However, the former Manchester United youngster somehow cleared the crossbar from three yards.\n\nSchofield, playing in place of ill first-choice goalkeeper Kamil Grabara, had his tricky moments, most notably in the first half, when he completely missed a McNair corner and was grateful to see the ball bounce to the safety of Daniel Ayala, the visitors\u2019 captain.\n\nAll the same, he did enough to convince Huddersfield manager Danny Cowley that he has a first-team future, on a night when the home side as a whole performed poorly despite extending their unbeaten run to five matches.", "description": "This was a scoreline only goalkeepers dream about, and while it was a night that the two inexperienced goalkeepers can remember with fondness, it is unlikely that anyone else will.", "authors": ["Mike Whalley"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213930375-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqvf93cyop1gpr4w56dB_PHCfEV3CM26dQGAXDBk_TJAA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
