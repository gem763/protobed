American Max jets (above) sit parked at a facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nSouthwest Airlines, the largest operator of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft (pictured above parked on the tarmac after being grounded, at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California, has 34 of the airliners\n\nThe ongoing safety review means a key 737 MAX certification test flight is unlikely before November, two sources told Reuters. Boeing has repeatedly said it hopes to resume flights in the fourth quarter, which began on Oct. 1.\n\nRegulators sought to play down talk of transatlantic divisions over safety changes to the 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March after two crashes killed 346 people within five months.\n\nThe FAA said in a statement it has a 'transparent and collaborative relationship' with other civil aviation authorities as it continues its 737 MAX safety review. Its European Union counterpart said it was in 'continuous contact' with both the FAA and Boeing.\n\n'We do not at this stage have any specific concerns resulting from that assessment that would mean that we could not agree to a coordinated return to service. We are in continuous contact with both the FAA and Boeing,' a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) spokeswoman said by email.\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Reuters in September the agency would need about a month following the yet-to-be scheduled certification test flight before the planes could return to service.\n\nThe FAA reiterated on Tuesday that it does not have a firm date for completing its review.\n\nUnited (pictured above) may end up joining its competitors in making another push back. The carrier said its grounded aircraft would result in 93 flight cancellations a day in November, and roughly 1,700 flight cancellations in the following month\n\nThat means United may end up joining its competitors in making another push back. The carrier said its grounded aircraft would result in 93 flight cancellations a day in November, and roughly 1,700 flight cancellations in the following month.\n\nThe news could be even worse for Southwestern, where pilot-union leaders say the carrier's return of the Max could even be later, possibly February or March.\n\nThat's several months later than earlier projections offered by either Southwest or Boeing. Both had suggested the plane would return to the skies by the end of the year.\n\nThe Max was grounded worldwide after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. Boeing is working on changes to flight-control software and computers.\n\nThe first disaster happened in October 2018 in Indonesia, when the plane fell into the Java Sea 15 minutes after taking off from Jakarta.\n\nAll 189 aboard the plane died reported CNN, including 180 Indonesians, one Italian and one Indian.\n\nThe second occurred in March this year when a 737 Max took off from Bole International Airport in the Ethiopian capital.\n\nThe plane lost contact six-minutes into its journey and went down near to Bishoftu, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board, including eight Americans.\n\nWreckage (pictured above) is piled at the crash scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\nBoeing was found to have known of issues with one of the plane's safety features as early as 2017, NPR reported. But it did not disclose this information to airlines or regulators until after the first crash.\n\nThe known problem was the 'angle of attack disagree alert,' which warns pilots if the planes sensors are transmitting contradictory data about the direction of the plane's nose.\n\nAt one point the 737 Max planes were the best selling aircraft for Boeing, but for now they will remain on the ground - and some believe they will never take to the skies again.\n\nOne with high hopes is President Donald Trump, who wrote on twitter just over a month after the most recent tragedy that they should consider re-branding.\n\nAn aerial view of Boeing 737 Max aircraft sitting parked at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington\n\n'If I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name,' he tweeted. 'No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?'\n\nBoeing originally warned the MAX was not expected to return to service until January, as regulators worked to expand safety checks after the jets were grounded in March following two deadly crashes.\n\nAviation experts and analysts say they expect the lengthy delay as the Federal Aviation Administration pledges to resolve all safety issues before allowing the planes back in the air, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nNo official timeline has been confirmed by the company but the checks on software has repeatedly delayed their progress with a growing list of issues for them to look over.\n\nBoeing is now said to be looking at other potential problems, including emergency recovery procedures to electronic components. Some checks are said to be looking at earlier 737 models too.", "description": "American Airlines joined Southwest Airlines in pushing back the return of their Boeing 737 Max jets into the New Year, which means only United expects to have the plane back in time for Christmas.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
