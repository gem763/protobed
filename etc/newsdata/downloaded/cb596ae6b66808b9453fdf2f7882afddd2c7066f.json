So, too, did expectations on forward orders and capacity utilisation.\n\nHowever, there remains concern about capital expenditure over the next 12 months.\n\nSome small businesses have reacted well to an increase and extension of a tax break that allows businesses with turnover of less than $10 million to immediately write off plant and equipment costing less than $25,000.\n\nAcross the sectors there were substantial improvements in business conditions in property and finance. Overall, conditions were most favourable in finance and health. Retail and wholesale also improved but both remained negative.\n\nCouncil of Small Business of Australia chief executive Peter Strong said the negativity around small business was unfounded.\n\n\"We hear a lot of negativity but really it's only in very specific areas. I think the drought also creates some negative perceptions because a lot of small businesses are in rural areas,\" he said.\n\n\"There are quite a few manufacturing companies that export that are doing much better and the services and health sectors are also doing well.\"\n\nReserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe has specifically pointed out the timidity of banks to lend to small business.\n\n\"It is important that our financial institutions support small businesses in particular. Lenders should not be so scared of making a loan that goes bad that they don\u2019t provide the credit that the economy needs,\" Dr Lowe said.\n\nThe weighted-average interest rate on current business variable-rate loans of $2 million or less was 5.45 per cent in the June quarter according to Reserve Bank data.", "description": "SME business conditions improved in all mainland states, with the largest gains coming in NSW and WA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1765%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_65/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1d2b1679e610080238aae53b95d1d30fcf518bd7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
