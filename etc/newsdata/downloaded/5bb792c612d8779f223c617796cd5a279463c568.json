But the ruling is likely to drive more Central American migrants to try to illegally enter the U.S. with the help of smugglers or move them to apply for asylum in Mexico, which is already swamped with applications.\n\nMexico has long resisted a so-called safe third country agreement with the U.S. that would require migrants to request asylum there first, but the court\u2019s decision appears to have unilaterally brought about the same result.\n\nOn Thursday, L\u00f3pez Obrador said that he spoke by phone with President Donald Trump a day prior, noting the U.S. president recognized Mexico\u2019s efforts and relations between the two countries were very good.\n\nHe also said things were looking better for the ratification of a new free trade agreement between U.S., Mexico and Canada.\n\n\u201cThere are no deep differences, there\u2019s no discrepancy, nothing that could lead them to take measures or apply measures that affect the economy, the development of our country,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cOn the contrary, there\u2019s a very favorable environment for the United States Congress\u2026 unbeatable conditions to approve the free trade treaty.\u201d\n\nHis conciliatory approach contrasts sharply with a tack taken earlier this year by Trump, who tied immigration to economic policy by threatening crippling tariffs on all Mexican imports.\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s threat, Mexico cracked down on migrants crossing the country, deployed the National Guard to the southern and northern borders, and tried to contain migrants to the southern part of the country.\n\nIt also accepted the expansion of the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, under which the U.S. has sent more than 40,000 asylum applicants back across the border to wait in Mexico.\n\nMexico announced Friday that it had reduced the flow of migrants arriving at its northern border by 56% in three months, and it has said that it\u2019s beginning to invest in the Central American countries responsible for the majority of the migrants.\n\nBut leftist L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s increasingly hardline immigration policies have attracted criticism at home and abroad.\n\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said this week she was concerned that immigration policies implemented in Mexico, the U.S. and some Central American countries \u201care putting migrants at heightened risk of human rights violations and abuses.\u201d\n\nAsked about her comments Thursday, Ebrard said Mexico also had concerns and requested a meeting with her office to exchange information.\n\nThe foreign minister also explained that in return for its work on immigration, Mexico has asked the U.S. government to help stem the tide of guns flowing into Mexico. The country currently has more murders than at any point in at least the past 20 years.\n\nEbrard said that 70% of the crimes committed with guns in Mexico between January and June involved guns purchased in the U.S.\n\n\u201cMexico put on the table in this meeting that control of arms trafficking at the border for us is of the same priority ranking as the immigration issue is for them,\u201d Ebrard said, referring to Tuesday talks. The two sides agreed to form a binational commission to track progress on the issue.\n\nEbrard said Mexico had proposed that the U.S. begin operations at border crossings in San Diego, as well as the Texan cities of El Paso, Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville. He said 41% of the guns used in crimes and recovered in Mexico have been traced back to Texas. Mexico wants the U.S. to do more to inspect whether vehicles leaving the country have guns and to investigate gun sales.\n\n\u201cMexico\u2019s objective would be to freeze arms traffic at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cFor that we need the participation of North American authorities.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico would never implement such a rule.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Christopher Sherman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/mexico_us_immigration_00545_c0-198-5093-3167_s1770x1032.jpg?e19f9de68bd46ff6313941e7636d0a96636a6dc6"}
