I think some players' heads have gone and the manager has no alternative options, and that's what's causing problems in the Spurs team.\n\n'Sometimes Pochettino only has one player available in a certain position, and that's not necessarily his fault. Things have become stale because of the lack of options.'\n\nChimbonda believes Pochettino is not to blame, rather Daniel Levy's lack of squad investment\n\nPASCAL CHIMBONDA AT TOTTENHAM Appearances: 103 Goals: 4 Assists: 8 Clean sheets: 18\n\nTottenham's 1-1 draw with bottom-of-the-table Watford at the weekend did nothing to appease the mounting pressure growing at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium following 7-2 and 3-0 defeats to Bayern Munich and Brighton in the space of a week before the international break.\n\nBut Chimbonda believes the former Southampton manager, who took Spurs to an unlikely Champions League final last season, will be given time to turn things around.\n\n'You never know in football. Things can happen at any time and managers can leave in an instant, but I don't think Daniel Levy would take that decision right now.\n\n'Even if they get a bad result in the Champions League on Tuesday, I don't think anything will happen, I think he'll wait until closer to January to see if things have improved and, if not, then maybe he'll consider his options.'\n\nThe Frenchman played for Spurs for two spells between 2006 and 2009 and was part of the side that won the League Cup in 2008, the last trophy the club have won.\n\nPochettino's men host Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League on Tuesday night, with their first win in the competition crucial to having any chance of qualifying from Group B.", "description": "Former Tottenham Hotspur right-back Pascal Chimbonda (left) believes Mauricio Pochettino (right) is not to blame for Spurs' poor start to the season but rather at the lack of squad investment.", "authors": ["Cian Cheesbrough For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20026288-0-image-a-11_1571732602178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
