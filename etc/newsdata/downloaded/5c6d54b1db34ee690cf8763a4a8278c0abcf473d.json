Latisha Drummond (in the chair at right) was having some dental work done at the free clinic in Baltimore. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nAs the sun rose Saturday, Delores Connolly stood in line outside a public school here clutching a numbered ticket. Connolly, 61, who has health insurance, was waiting to enter a clinic offering free medical and dental care.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing with me now,\u201d Connolly said, fidgeting as a uniformed woman at the entrance to Pimlico Elementary/Middle School repeatedly called out No. 92, in English and Spanish. Connolly was No. 93. Dental care was dropped from her Medicaid coverage this year, Connolly said, and her plan would not cover eyeglasses to replace a pair she had lost. She had queued up at 5:30 a.m. at a temporary clinic operated in Baltimore over the weekend by the nonprofit Remote Area Medical (RAM).\n\nHer number finally called, Connolly proceeded into the school, a participant in a ritual that offered a telling view of the nation\u2019s health-care system in 2019. Nearly a decade after passage of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which promised to overhaul that system with a dramatic expansion of coverage \u2014 Americans with and without insurance were lining up before dawn to obtain care they otherwise couldn\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cWhatever they\u2019re offering here, I\u2019ll grab it,\u201d said Nelia Shipley, 65. Shipley, who has insurance, had heard about the clinic from her friend, 70-year-old Virginia Young, who also has insurance. Both were in line at the school. \u201cWe need help,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here.\u201d\n\nTennessee-based RAM was founded in 1985 as a volunteer corps of medical professionals to provide free care in underserved regions of developing countries. But the group quickly established mobile clinics in the United States, responding to the many uninsured.\n\nToday, much of that population differs in its coverage status but not in its need. Forty-nine percent of RAM patients this year have lacked health insurance, according to figures provided by the group. A larger share, 84 percent, lacked insurance for vision or dental care, which are among the most popular services at the mobile clinics.\n\n\n\nTeresa Sorrell came early from Harrisonburg, Va., to line up for dental care. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIf you look at someone who\u2019s making $15,000 to $20,000 per year, and they have a $5,000 deductible \u2014 they have insurance, but they don\u2019t have health care,\u201d said Jeff Eastman, RAM\u2019s chief executive. Eastman said the group, which originally focused on rural areas with high poverty rates, is increasingly operating in large cities. Some, like Baltimore, are home to top hospitals. RAM has set up clinics in Tennessee and Kentucky. But it has also delivered care in Florida and Orange County, Calif.\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks that health care, and lack thereof, is an Appalachian issue,\u201d Eastman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s across the whole United States.\u201d\n\nLast year, the group served more than 45,000 people.\n\nThis was RAM\u2019s second visit to Baltimore, a city that \u2014 from presidential accusations of rodent infestation to the resignation in May of a scandalized mayor \u2014 has become a potent but often misunderstood icon of 21st-century urban America. During the first visit, in 2017, the group said, it provided more than $646,000 worth of free care to 1,140 people.\n\n[Years before Trump\u2019s attacks, Freddie Gray\u2019s death sparked a huge effort to heal Baltimore. It wasn\u2019t enough.]\n\nThe mobile clinic, open through Sunday at the school in northwest Baltimore, is a collaboration of RAM and insurance company Aetna, which secured the site, contributed funding and organized more than 200 volunteers. Ticket distribution began at 3 a.m. Saturday, and doors opened at 6. By 9 a.m., more than 200 patients had been seen.\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., the school\u2019s gymnasium \u2014 transformed into a dentistry emporium \u2014 was crowded and filled with the whine of whirring drills. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young (D) and City Council Vice President Sharon Green Middleton toured the facility. As Young recorded a video on his phone to help publicize the event, Latisha Drummond reclined in a chair behind him, enduring the final stages of a tooth scaling.\n\nDrummond, a 28-year-old Baltimore resident, has insurance coverage through her job as a postal worker. She said her plan covers basic dental cleanings but not the more extensive work she needed after four years without seeing a dentist. During that time, she said, she had focused on dental care for her 3-year-old son, Za\u2019Khari.\n\n\u201cYou got to take your pick,\u201d she said. \u201cPay your own bills, pay your children\u2019s bills.\u201d\n\nDrummond had arrived at midnight to claim ticket No. 2. She took Za\u2019Khari to the school playground in the dark as she and others waited for the clinic to open.\n\nShortly after Drummond and her son left the gym, No. 93 \u2014 Connolly \u2014 came in. She had been through intake and a basic medical screening, and now sat in the bleachers waiting for a dental chair to open. After that, she would go to her eye exam.\n\nConnolly talked to a reporter about the minutiae of her insurance policy. While her dental coverage was gone, she said, she liked the medical component of the plan and was afraid to switch. On balance, and under the circumstances, she thought it was the best she could do. She was grateful that free care was available to fill the gaps.\n\nThen, as a volunteer in a bright orange vest approached, hand outstretched, Connolly smiled.\n\n\u201cMiss,\u201d the volunteer said, \u201cyou can come.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "\u201cWhatever they\u2019re offering here, I\u2019ll grab it,\u201d one woman said.
