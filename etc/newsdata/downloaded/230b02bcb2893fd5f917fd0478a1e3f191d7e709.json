The honeymoon period is long gone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked and saddened by how bad they were today,\u201d Roy Keane, a former team mate of Solskjaer at Old Trafford, told Sky Sports. \u201cLacklustre, no quality, no leaders, lack of desire. It\u2019s scary how far they have fallen.\u201d\n\nUnited, who are eighth in the table, face Rochdale in the League Cup this week, then host Arsenal in the league with two wins essential to lift the gloom hovering over the club.\n\nIs VAR sucking the life out of the game?\n\nFormer England striker Gary Lineker certainly thinks so after the Video Assistant Referee again played a key role in the weekend\u2019s action with several marginal calls.\n\nChelsea were denied an equaliser against Liverpool on Sunday when VAR ruled that Mason Mount had been just offside in the build-up to Cesar Azpilicueta\u2019s goal. A day earlier Tottenham Hotspur were denied a goal by Serge Aurier after VAR ruled a millimetre of Son Heung-min\u2019s body had been offside in the move.\n\nThe introduction of the technology appears to have cancelled out any benefit of the doubt for attackers, with some suggesting the law needs to be revised to redress the balance.\n\n\u201cTilting the balance of power in favour of the defender. This cannot be right when football\u2019s role is to produce goals and entertain the fans,\u201d former referee Keith Hackett told the Telegraph. \u201cThe authorities need to address the offside law, which pre-dates VAR and therefore does not account for it.\u201d\n\nManchester City over their hiccup?\n\nAfter the shock of losing 3-2 at Norwich City the previous week and falling five points behind Liverpool, Manchester City\u2019s response has been devastating.\n\nFirst they outclassed Shakhtar Donetsk away in the Champions League in midweek, then on Saturday Pep Guardiola\u2019s side thrashed Watford 8-0, scoring their first five goals inside the opening 20 minutes at the Etihad Stadium.\n\n\u201cThey will do it to somebody, there will be a nine or 10 out there soon,\u201d Watford keeper Ben Foster said.\n\nIs this the season for a new name in the top four?\n\nWith Tottenham Hotspur unable to buy an away win, Chelsea in transition, Manchester United in a rut and Arsenal leaking goals for fun is this the season the top-four gets a new member?\n\nLeicester City are third after six games and West Ham United are fifth, both with 11 points, while Bournemouth are above Tottenham, Chelsea and United.\n\nIt is early days but the battle for third and fourth might just involve more than the usual suspects this season.\n\nLiverpool show winning mentality is now ingrained\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nLiverpool have become a winning machine in the Premier League under Juergen Klopp who has 92 victories from his first 150 games in charge, a stat only bettered by Jose Mourinho.\n\nSunday\u2019s 2-1 victory at Chelsea was not pretty but means they have started with six wins, as they did last season, and have won 15 on the bounce in the league.\n\nWith a five-point lead they will take some shifting.", "description": "Here are five talking points from the latest round of Premier League fixtures:", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433023277&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1KY", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
