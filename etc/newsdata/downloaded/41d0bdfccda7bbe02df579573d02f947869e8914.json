Experts say eight million tonnes of plastic waste \u2014 including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items \u2014 flow annually into oceans from beaches, rivers and creeks, endangering marine life in the oceans, including whales.\n\nThree of the machines have already been deployed to Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, and a fourth is heading to the Dominican Republic, he said.\n\nFirst images of Interceptor 002 cleaning in Malaysia. <a href=\"https://t.co/RDZioYgcUk\">pic.twitter.com/RDZioYgcUk</a> \u2014@TheOceanCleanup\n\nIzham Hashim, from the government of Selangor state in Malaysia, was present at Slat's device unveiling, and said he was happy with the machine.\n\n\"It has been used for 1\u00bd months in the river and it's doing very well, collecting the plastic bottles and all the rubbish,\" he said.\n\nSlat said he believes 1,000 rivers are responsible for some 80 per cent of plastic pouring into the world's oceans and he wants to tackle them all in the next five years.\n\n\"This is not going to be easy, but imagine if we do get this done,\" he told his audience of enthusiastic supporters, who whooped, clapped and cheered his announcements. \"We could truly make our oceans clean again.\"\n\nSlat used his live-streamed unveiling to appeal for support from countries committing to clean up their rivers and businesses prepared to inject funding and help with the operation of the devices.\n\nA child walks on Kampung Jawa Beach, which is littered with plastic waste, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, Aceh, Indonesia.

The interceptors work by guiding plastic waste into an opening in its bow, a conveyor belt then carries the trash into the guts of the machine where it is dropped into dumpsters. The interceptor sends a text message to local operators that can come and empty it when it's full.\n\nSlat showed off how it worked by dumping hundreds of yellow rubber ducks into the water at the launch event in Rotterdam's port. The interceptor caught nearly all of them.\n\nMachines cost $1M each\n\nThe machines currently are about 700,000 euros ($1,015,000 Cdn), but Slat said the cost will likely drop as production increases.\n\nJan van Franeker of the Wageningen Marine Research institute has been critical of The Ocean Cleanup in the past, but said the new device looks promising.\n\n\"I am really happy they finally moved toward the source of the litter,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"The design, from what I can see, looks pretty good.\"\n\nSlat argued that the economic impact of not picking plastic out of rivers is higher than the cost of buying and using the machines.\n\n\"Deploying interceptors is even cheaper than deploying nothing at all.\"", "description": "A young Dutch inventor is widening his effort to clean up floating plastic from the Pacific Ocean by also moving into rivers, using a new floating device to catch garbage before it reaches the seas.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5337735.1572263943!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/netherlands-ocean-cleanup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
