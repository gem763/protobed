As a society, it is imperative that we learn to forgive mistakes made decades ago.\n\nThere is no public figure who has ever lived or ever will live who was or will be perfect; it is pointless to look for one. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s scandal is a prime example of this. Who would expect that one of the best-known advocates for minority rights in a liberal country had donned blackface? Past actions, though important, should not be the deciding factor in the court of public opinion. Current values and decisions matter more.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Ralph Northam, Kyle Kashuv or Justin Trudeau, we must understand that people can and do change as they experience new things and understand new perspectives. If we wish to be forgiven of our own transgressions, we must forgive others of theirs.\n\nJACK CHILD\n\nFalls Church, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
