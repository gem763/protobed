While the Americans will square off against the Dominican Republic for gold.\n\nOutside hitter Marie-Alex Belanger led Canada's attack. The native of Saint-Alphonse-Rodriguez, Que., had six attacks and two blocks for eight points.\n\n\"I am happy with the way we competed and how we executed,\" said Ben Josephson, Canada's coach. \"For us the lesson is in the details, some really small things were missed on our side - coverage, a free ball pass or high ball set, and against a team that is really good, the little things are big things. We played well in the big rallies. We can play really well when we are focused.\"", "description": "Canada's women\u2019s volleyball team suffered a tough loss in the semifinals of the NORCECA\u00a0Continental Championship on Saturday.", "authors": ["Cbc Sports"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319832.1570940928!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/canada-us-101219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
