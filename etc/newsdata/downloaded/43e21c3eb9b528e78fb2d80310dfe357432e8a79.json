A few lightning bugs are still winking beneath the dark trees at dusk, but the cicadas that have been singing in the branches all summer are beginning to weaken and lose their grip. Last week I saw a cardinal, her head nearly bald from her August molt, snatch a fallen cicada from the grass and carry it across three yards before disappearing with it behind a neighbor\u2019s house. I could hear the cicada crying out as it was borne away.\n\nThere is no reason for me to set out birdseed at summer\u2019s end, for summer\u2019s bounty is everywhere. The branches of the sugar maple trees are heavy with seeds \u2014 from a distance it looks as though they have turned brown instead of waiting to go golden in the cool of fall. Every limb, every twig is dense with seeds, a load so heavy that the lower branches are nearly brushing the ground. It\u2019s a mast year for maples here, and I wonder if the trees know somehow that they lost a sister to the spring storms and so are bearing enough seeds for her, too.\n\nThe berries on the volunteer pokeweed plant are still green and hard, but the Southern arrowwood bushes are adorned with bright blue berries. The drooping petals of the coneflowers are dry and brittle now, and the goldfinches are tearing apart the seed crowns, picking each seed from its spiky carapace. I plant coneflowers for the pollinators because so many of them are in trouble, but I don\u2019t deadhead the plants to force them to produce more blooms, for there are few things more heart-lifting in this world than the sight of a goldfinch still wearing his summer finery and riding a coneflower tossing in the autumn wind.\n\nA new slant of light signals the changing season even in this humid heat, and the ruby-throated hummingbirds know it. In this yard, the hummingbird wars are always the earliest sign of the coming fall, as the birds bulk up for their long flight, guarding every nectar source before they go. Soon they will make their way south to their wintering grounds in Central America. Some will go by land. Others will fly on their impossibly tiny wings all the way across the Gulf of Mexico. In the meantime, they fight for dominance over the feeders I\u2019ve set out to help them.\n\nAdding more feeders does nothing to resolve their disputes. There is plenty of food to go around, plenty of insects and plenty of seeds, but the creatures in my yard have no interest in sharing.", "description": "The first signs of a changing season remind us that nothing \u2014 bad or good \u2014 is bound to last.", "authors": ["Margaret Renkl"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/opinion/30renklWeb/30renklWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
