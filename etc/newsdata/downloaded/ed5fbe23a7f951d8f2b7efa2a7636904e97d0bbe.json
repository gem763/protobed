In June, Twitter said world leaders\u2019 tweets that violate its rules but have a clear public-interest value might get a warning label. The label would provide context on the violation and let people to click through to see the tweet if they want to.\n\nWhile Twitter said in June that it will not use its algorithms to \u201celevate\u201d or otherwise promote tweets that have a warning label, it now says it also won\u2019t let people retweet or comment on them. People will still be able to \u201cquote tweet\u201d the material. Quote tweeting lets users add their own message above someone else\u2019s tweet and post it on their own timeline. This nuance shows the fine line Twitter is trying to walk with its policy \u2014 it wants to promote free expression and allow people to comment on controversial tweets, but it doesn\u2019t want to promote them on their own, without context.\n\nWith all that, the company has yet to slap a tweet with a warning label since putting its policy into effect. So is it all for show? Below are some questions and answers about Twitter\u2019s policy.\n\nWhat did Twitter do?\n\nOn Tuesday, Twitter said it\u2019ll take action on any account \u2014 world leader or not \u2014 that makes clear and direct threats of violence against a person, depending on the context. What is this context? A world leader interacting directly with another public figure, or commenting on political and foreign policy issues, would \u201clikely not result in enforcement,\u201d Twitter said.\n\n\u201cForeign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules,\u201d the blog post reads. For instance, Trump has threatened Iran on Twitter, prompting his critics to call for his removal from the service. But based on Twitter\u2019s policy, that doesn\u2019t count as a violation.\n\nBut other things, such as promoting terrorism, posting someone\u2019s private information such as an address or phone number, promoting self-harm, engaging in child sexual exploitation or sharing intimate photos of someone without their consent could all get a world leader kicked off Twitter.\n\nWhy did Twitter do this?\n\nTwitter wouldn\u2019t say what prompted Tuesday\u2019s blog post. But there\u2019s been growing pressure from Democrats, including presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris, to remove Trump from Twitter because of what they see as bullying and abuse. In a public letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Harris listed offending tweets from Trump such as one on Sept. 29 when he wrote that he wants Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff arrested and questioned for \u201ctreason.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter\u2019s user agreement, not even the President of the United States,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nBut not only has Twitter not removed Trump, the tweets in question are without any warning label. Even with Tuesday\u2019s explanation, it is not entirely clear what tweets from a world leader could get one. Since Schiff is also a public figure, Twitter could say it doesn\u2019t count even if he is targeted by the president.\n\nWhat do critics think?\n\nTwitter has critics on all sides. Keegan Hankes, research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project who focuses on far-right extremist propaganda online, called the policy statement a step in the right direction. But, he added, Twitter is essentially arguing \u201cthat hate speech can be in the public interest. I am arguing that hate speech is never in the public interest.\u201d\n\nIf Trump\u2019s tweets were to get a warning label, however, this could fuel his supporters\u2019 ire toward Twitter. The president routinely complains, without evidence, that social media sites are biased against him and other conservatives.\n\nWhat about other companies?\n\nNeither Facebook FB, +0.35% nor Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL, +0.06% Google (or YouTube) have specific policies exempting world leaders from their rules. But Trump\u2019s use of Twitter is unique as it is unprecedented, so other social media companies have not felt the same pressure to enact such a policy. All the big social media companies generally ban direct threats of violence, supporting terrorism, as well as hate speech and abuse. But enforcement can be spotty on all counts, and context matters \u2014 even in the president\u2019s case, many of the tweets that offend his critics could fall in a gray area.\n\nThat said, Facebook\u2019s recently announced policy of not fact-checking politicians\u2019 posts or advertisements has drawn fire from critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic presidential candidate. To prove her point, Warren took out an ad on Facebook that purposely made the false claim that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump for president.\n\nYouTube, meanwhile, says it removes material that violates its community guidelines, regardless of who posts it.\n\n\u201cWe do not treat politicians any differently,\u201d said YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo.", "description": "Twitter says world leaders aren\u2019t entirely above its ban on users threatening violence or promoting terrorism on the site.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT469_twitte_ZG_20191016185423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
