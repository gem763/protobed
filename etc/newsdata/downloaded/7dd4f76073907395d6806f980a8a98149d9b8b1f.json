She was also fined \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,960).\n\nMr Eid said he had been taking pictures of a room so he could return furniture to the same positions when he finished his work.\n\n\u201cThe princess noticed that her face was reflected in the bathroom and that she had been filmed,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called me a dog who didn\u2019t deserve to live, and called her bodyguard.\u201d Rani Saida, the bodyguard, snatched his phone, bound his hands, punched and kicked him and forced him to kiss the princess\u2019s feet, according to the plumber.\n\nPrincess Hassa allegedly told him: \u201cYou\u2019ll see how you speak to a princess, how you speak to the royal family.\u201d\n\nThe princess, 43, left France shortly after the incident in September 2016 and was sentenced in absentia. The Paris court found her guilty of complicity in violence, sequestration and theft of the plumber\u2019s telephone.\n\nEmmanuel Moyne, her lawyer, said she denied any wrongdoing and would appeal. He described Mr Eid\u2019s testimony as \u201cfanciful\u201d.\n\nRani Saida, the bodyguard, was given an 8-month suspended sentence and fined \u20ac5,000 (\u00a34,480). His lawyer said he would also appeal.\n\nIt is not the first time members of the Saudi royal family have fallen foul of the law in France.\n\nIn 2013, a court ordered the seizure of the French assets of another princess, Maha al-Sudairi, over unpaid hotel bills of nearly \u20ac6 million (more than \u00a35.3m).\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the court\u2019s rulings would complicate France\u2019s close relations with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The only daughter of King Salman of Saudi Arabia received a 10-month suspended prison sentence on Thursday for ordering her bodyguard to beat up a plumber in her luxury Paris flat.
