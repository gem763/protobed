The Cyclones (1-1) are averaging a paltry 15 points per game in regulation and are minus-3 in turnovers through two games.\n\nThe Warhawks (1-1) enter Saturday\u2019s game at Jack Trice Stadium with a senior quarterback in Caleb Evans, one of the nation\u2019s better rushing attacks and the confidence that came from pushing Florida State to overtime Sept. 7 before losing 45-44. ULM also had a bye after that narrow loss, giving it an extra week to prepare for the Cyclones, who are 18 \u00bd-point favorites.\n\n\u201cProbably the most, in terms of skill, the most talented team we\u2019ve played,\u201d Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \u201cA team that can really run (and) defensively creates a lot of havoc.\u201d\n\nSCOUTING THE WARHAWKS\n\nULM\u2019s attack is headlined by Evans (424 yards, 3 touchdowns and a 66.7%t completion rate) and junior running back Josh Johnson, who ranks fourth nationally with 149.5 yards rushing per game. The Warhawks also brought back eight starters on defense, although those players were part of a unit that let up 31.8 points a game in 2018. Florida State had little trouble moving the ball against ULM, compiling 501 yards and going 10 of 19 on third downs.\n\nIOWA STATE\u2019S STRUGGLES\n\nThe Cyclones have scored touchdowns just three times in seven trips to the red zone. They\u2019ve also converted just 10 of 27 third downs despite averaging 440 yards of offense a game, and 16 of Iowa State\u2019s 46 points came during the three overtimes it needed to beat Northern Iowa 29-26 in its opener.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s those details, those little things that we\u2019ve got to continue to shore up and pound away at if we want to be the best version of us we can be,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nCYCLONES D\n\nIowa State\u2019s defense has been about as good as anyone in the country. The Cyclones, who confuse opponents with multiple looks from its base 3-4, are allowing just 15.5 points a game in regulation and have allowed just one TD in non-overtime play. That ties Georgia for second nationally, with only Wisconsin having yet to allow a TD in 2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen, certainly in all my years of coaching, some of the things they do and how they do it,\u201d ULM coach Tommy Viator said.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nULM is 0-11 against Big 12 opponents. That includes a 42-7 loss to Iowa State in 1980. \u2026Iowa State\u2019s Deshaunte Jones leads the country with 9 receptions a game. \u2026Evans had 273 total yards and four TDs in that loss to the Seminoles. \u2026Cyclones quarterback Brock Purdy has completed at least 70 percent of his passes seven times in 11 games. \u2026Iowa State\u2019s last five games have been decided by a total of 13 points.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\n\u201cWe want to get this into the second half with a chance to win. That\u2019s what Northern Iowa did.\u201d - Viator.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Iowa State has just one more chance to find its rhythm ahead of Big 12 play.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/iowa_iowa_st_football_94969_c0-212-2989-1954_s1770x1032.jpg?dd9f08267294e3d48d19d3c3f26dad85b41695ce", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
