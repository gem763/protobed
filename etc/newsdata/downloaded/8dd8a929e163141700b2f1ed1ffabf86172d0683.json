The politician travels to that country and demands the removal of a prosecutor who\u2019s investigating the company. That prosecutor then gets axed, and the investigation shut down.\n\nImagine the son was Eric Trump, and the politician Donald Trump. Would the media be dismissing it as nothing worth looking at, a \u201cdebunked\u201d issue?\n\nYes, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor declared in May that he\u2019d seen no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. (Of course not: Again, the investigation got closed years ago.) Yet Yuriy Lut\u00adsenko also basically told Bloomberg News he didn\u2019t want to see any such evidence: \u201cI do not want Ukraine to again be the subject of US presidential elections.\u201d\n\nAnd Volodymyr Zelensky took over as Ukraine\u2019s new president after that Lutsenko interview \u2014 having won on a vow to end Ukraine\u2019s endemic corruption. Was it really so strange that President Trump pushed the reformer to reopen the probe?\n\nNo, Trump hasn\u2019t bathed himself in glory with his ham-handed pressure on Ukraine. Then again, Joe Biden\u2019s boasts about getting that prosecutor axed also look clumsy. Then there\u2019s Lutsenko\u2019s claim that the Obama administration handed him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list in mid-2016, even as it was pushing Ukraine for dirt on Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nThat evidence eventually helped send Manafort to prison. What might come of a full-on Hunter Biden probe?\n\nAll of which makes it somewhat astounding that the media has circled the wagons when it comes to Hunter\u2019s behavior.\n\nParticularly since the Ukraine affair isn\u2019t unique: As Peter Schweitzer reported in The Post, Hunter\u2019s private equity fund Rosemont Capital (co-founded with John Kerry stepson Chris Heinz) similarly exploited family connections \u2014 in name, at the very least \u2014 to grow to $2.4 billion under management. Notably, one breakthrough was an early meeting with China\u2019s largest, most powerful government-funded leaders \u2014 the same day Joe Biden met with China\u2019s president.\n\nA second meeting with the same Beijing bigs came just two weeks after the then-veep opened the US-China Strategic Dialogue with top Chinese officials. And Hunter would close a billion-dollar Rosemont deal with the government-run Bank of China in 2013 while accompanying his dad on a top-level trip to Beijing.\n\nLiberal pundits routinely charge that Trump has used the presidency to vastly enrich himself, though the \u201cscandals\u201d boil down to people staying at his hotels, which is chump change. It\u2019s easy enough to see why he sees red over the fact that the press holds the Biden family to a far softer standard.", "description": "Liberal pundits routinely charge that Trump has used the presidency to vastly enrich himself, though the \u201cscandals\u201d boil down to people staying at his hotels, which is chump change.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hunter_joe_biden.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
