The world\u2019s most wanted man has been brought to justice. The world is a safer place today. This victory for the U.S. and our many counterterrorism partners is a significant step for the campaign against ISIS, for the future of the Middle East, and for the safety of the American people and free people around the world. A victory like this is only possible because of the expertise, skill, and courage of those who work to keep the United States safe. I am grateful for the intelligence professionals who laid the groundwork for this raid, for the brave American servicemembers who risked everything to carry it out, and to President Trump and his team for their leadership. While we welcome the fact that al-Baghdadi has been brought to justice, we know we cannot underestimate the resilience of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda. The important counterterrorism work of the United States, our international coalition partners, and local forces will not end with this significant victory. To the contrary, history shows us how vital it is to keep building on this victory and continue our work to set the conditions for the enduring defeat of ISIS, al Qaeda, and other terrorists in Syria, in Afghanistan, and around the world.\n\nHouse Ranking Member Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) released the following statement, praising the military for their work:\n\nThis morning\u2019s announcement should confirm for the world what many already knew\u2014that terrorists cannot outlast or outmatch the commitment of the U.S. counter-terrorism apparatus. We will not stop or waver in destroying terrorist leaders wherever they hide. May God bless the men and women in our military who protect us and make us proud every day with their efforts and achievements in continuing the fight against terrorism.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) released the following statement, congratulating the military and President Trump:\n\nThe mission that took out ISIS leader al-Baghdadi is a major victory in America's war against terror. I congratulate our military's special operations force, as well as President Trump, for directing this raid that took out the head of ISIS. This sends a powerful message that the United States will seek justice against anyone who seeks to reign terror against America.\n\nVarious members of Congress tweeted similar reactions:\n\nOnce again, America\u2019s military raises the bar\n\n\n\nThank you to the incredible men and women who professionally executed the mission to find and eliminate ISIS leader Al-Baghdadi\n\n\n\nThank you @realDonaldTrump for green-lighting the mission and allowing our soldiers to act decisively \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) October 27, 2019\n\nI commend our intelligence community for their work, and our Special Forces for eliminating the leader of ISIS. I commend @realDonaldTrump for giving the order to do so. https://t.co/wkUFam5WxM \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) October 27, 2019\n\nToday we should also remember the thousands of victims of #alBaghdadi\u2019s crimes.\n\n\n\nIn particular I am thinking of our friends @artsotloff & Shirley Sotloff whose son Steven was brutally murdered by #ISIS killers. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 27, 2019\n\nAnd then Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) released a ridiculous statement slamming President Trump for his decision to pull troops out of northern Syria (emphasis mine):\n\nAmericans salute the heroism, dedication and skill of our military and our intelligence professionals and acknowledge the work of our partners in the region. We are relieved that no U.S. personnel died in this daring raid. The death of al-Baghdadi is significant, but the death of this ISIS leader does not mean the death of ISIS. Scores of ISIS fighters remain under uncertain conditions in Syrian prisons, and countless others in the region and around the world remain intent on spreading their influence and committing acts of terror. This month, the House passed a joint resolution on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 354-60 basis which rejects President Trump\u2019s green-lighting of Turkish aggression into Syria against our Kurdish partners, and calls on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS. The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region. Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\n\nPelosi is angry that her caucus wasn't briefed on the operation before it took place. Trump said he didn't brief Congress beforehand because he wanted the element of surprise and Washington is famous for leaks. He had a point. Congress knew nothing and the military had the element of surprise on their side, which kept our troops safe.\n\nInstead of being pissed off that she didn't get briefed on what took place, she should be happy that the world's leading terrorist is dead and American lives were spared. This is greater than political parties.", "description": "Of course..10/27/2019 20:22:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/5362b7ab-ef7e-449c-8704-0e51a8cf9d45.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
