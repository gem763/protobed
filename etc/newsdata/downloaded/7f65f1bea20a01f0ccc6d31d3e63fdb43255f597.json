We were reminiscing the other day about the relative pressures of the two roles.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of crisis in rugby, it was agreed \u2014 unless you get knocked out of a home World Cup at the pool stage.\n\nEven then, Gareth mused, it wasn\u2019t like a run of bad results at Chelsea. No aspect of the fall-out in 2015 under Stuart Lancaster compared to the maelstrom that could envelop a football club.\n\nElite clubs such as Manchester United have created a predicament for themselves\n\nThis is where Manchester United and, to a similar extent, Tottenham find themselves now. It might be Manchester City\u2019s turn soon if they continue losing ground on Liverpool. This is the price that is paid for being a member of the elite.\n\nIn the days of greater mobility for clubs, there was no big issue if games were lost or even if league form collapsed.\n\nWith Liverpool the single exception, in the era before the Premier League, teams shifted up and down the division without too much fuss or grand expectation.\n\nIn 1972-73 the top five were Liverpool, Arsenal, Leeds, Ipswich and Wolves. The next season Arsenal came 10th, Wolves 12th. The following year, Arsenal fell to 16th, Wolves came 12th again.\n\nYet throughout that time neither club changed its manager. Ipswich finished fourth twice, then third. Nobody decided Bobby Robson had taken them as far as he could. This is what has changed.\n\nThere is an elite that expects to be in roughly the same position each year, and to vacate that space is calamitous.\n\nUnited's drive to be seen as better means they are under more pressure when they struggle\n\nTo finish outside the top four is bad enough and few managers would survive a journey into the hinterland that does not even include a berth in the Europa League. There is talk of seasons of transition but it\u2019s bluster.\n\nTransition isn\u2019t allowed at an elite club, just a temporary dip in standards remedied quickly.\n\nManchester United are plainly amid a period of upheaval now. Yet little of the reaction to Sunday\u2019s defeat by Newcastle told of acceptance. Losing at Newcastle, at Brighton, is now bigger than going out of a World Cup, or so it must seem when viewed from the eye of the storm.\n\nAnd these eruptions are not mere media fantasies. Yes, the amount of time and space devoted to the Premier League on the air and in newspapers has made the focus more intense.\n\nSo have social media outlets giving every fan a microphone. Lose and it seems the entire world is talking about you, berating you, calling for your head. Yet the elite clubs have created this predicament for themselves.\n\nThe drive to be seen as separate, as better, than the rest of the competition \u2014 made plain in the demand for additional overseas broadcast revenue as the stars of the show \u2014 have created clubs that cannot lose without it being considered a critical condition.\n\nThe elite must be victorious, must live up to assumed status as football\u2019s virtuosi, must be pleasing on the eye.\n\nAt United, Jose Mourinho came second to Manchester City, Louis van Gaal won the FA Cup, but neither was loved because their football was staid. Haplessly, the elite have imposed standards they cannot hope to maintain. Not all of them in any one season, anyway.\n\nTottenham are better than their league position suggests but are now under serious pressure\n\nAnd that creates the pressure United and Tottenham are feeling now. Both teams are better than their league position suggests.\n\nUnited have the same points as Sheffield United and Brighton but in defeat at Newcastle this weekend were represented by players who would walk into either of those teams.\n\nWhat would Chris Wilder or Graham Potter give for David de Gea, Marcus Rashford, Harry Maguire, Daniel James or Juan Mata? Even the lesser lights such as Scott McTominay would get straight in.\n\nSimilarly, Tottenham\u2019s defeat at Brighton featured Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Christian Eriksen, Erik Lamela, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. Might some of that number get a game at Bournemouth, also on 11 points after eight matches?\n\nSo chances are this is not permanent. United and Tottenham will surely improve. Not to where they want to be, perhaps, yet better than this.\n\nWhat makes it ever harder to bounce back, however, is that drama so easily becomes crisis.\n\nUnited and Tottenham are playing under pressure akin to a relegation battle now. They face their own form of demotion \u2014 from the elite they fought so hard to create.\n\nFor the supposed inferiors, the irony must be very rich indeed.\n\nNewcastle are hugely inconsistent, we see that. Nevertheless, eight games in, they have eight points, having won and drawn twice.\n\nAt the same stage last season they had two points, after six defeats and two draws.\n\nBoth campaigns had comparatively tough early fixtures and featured matches against Tottenham, Arsenal, Manchester United and Leicester.\n\nLast season also included games against Chelsea and Manchester City, this season it was Liverpool.\n\nResults against the teams near the bottom must improve, but it is not the disaster painted in some quarters. And Newcastle have only lost two of their last seven games. Not that you\u2019d know it.\n\nLingard axe will have hurt Southgate\n\nInjury would have kept Jesse Lingard out of England\u2019s squad anyway but, even so, his prior exclusion by Gareth Southgate came as a surprise.\n\nHowever inconsistent his form for Manchester United, Lingard has rarely let Southgate down. Leaving out Dele Alli drew the headlines, but he would surely have agonised over Lingard more.\n\nGareth Southgate will have agonised over the decision to leave Jesse Lingard out of his squad\n\nHassan has lost right to be angry\n\nSifan Hassan said she was angry. She had run a time over 1,500 metres that had only been bettered by athletes whose coaches were cheats, or under great suspicion of cheating, her own coach had just been given a four-year ban for doping, and now people were doubting her, too. How dare they?\n\n\u2018I did my best here to show the world I\u2019m clean, I\u2019m always clean, I will be clean,\u2019 Hassan said. \u2018I just want to show people that hard work can be better than everything.\u2019\n\nAnd how did she do this? By employing the skills of a coach accused of doping. What does that prove? Hassan may have joined the disgraced Nike Oregon Project after the period under investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, but allegations about her coach Alberto Salazar were very much in the public domain by then, and well known inside the sport.\n\nMark Daly, who led the Panorama investigation that helped bring Salazar down, said he heard them when he began exploring doping in athletics in 2013.\n\nBy employing Alberto Salazar as her coach, Sifan Hassan has lost her right to be angry\n\nHis programme was broadcast in June 2015. Hassan joined the Nike Oregon Project in late 2016. If she wanted to show the world how clean she was, why sign up with a coach accused of being dirty?\n\nAt least wait for the USADA investigation to run its course. It was not as if Salazar was the only coach available. Just the only one getting such incredible improvements from his athletes.\n\nSo, at that moment, Hassan surrendered her right to anger at any questioning of her feats. As Michael Johnson, a rare independent voice covering athletics for the BBC, said: \u2018Running fast under a doping cloud does not actually make you clean.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s right. Hassan, the first athlete to win gold in 1,500m and 10,000m at a World Championships, proved nothing in Doha.\n\nThat she ran the sixth fastest 1,500m in history only added to the negativity, given the names in front of her and the coaches who helped produce those performances.\n\nJama Aden, coach of Genzebe Dibaba, was arrested on suspicion of doping in 2016, while Ma Junren is now widely believed to have doped to produce astonishing times from Chinese athletes.\n\nThe company Hassan keeps is why there are questions, and her anger should be the least of our concerns.\n\nIf Nike-backed Paula Radcliffe could also find the time to explain to Laura Muir, who finished fifth behind Hassan, how USADA\u2019s takedown of Salazar doesn\u2019t help clean athletes, that would be enlightening, too.\n\nNeville as inconsistent as United\n\nIt is not just Manchester United that are struggling to find a way out of the present tailspin.\n\nOn Sky, their former captain Gary Neville spoke of the team going backwards.\n\n\u2018They\u2019d be better off with Marouane Fellaini up front, with Romelu Lukaku, with Alexis Sanchez, there\u2019s no doubt,\u2019 he said.\n\nAnd maybe he was using this underwhelming trio as a barometer of how bad it has got.\n\nYet here is Neville on Lukaku in August: \u2018I\u2019m delighted he\u2019s left. I won\u2019t be happy until every single one of them that think they are better and bigger than the club and don\u2019t want to be here are gone. Unprofessionalism is contagious.\u2019\n\nManchester United legend Gary Neville has been inconsistent in his criticism of the club\n\nAnd on Sanchez: \u2018He\u2019s been a disaster, an absolute disaster. I have no idea what\u2019s happened to Alexis Sanchez. There must be two of them.\n\n\u2018The one we saw playing for Barcelona and Arsenal for five, six, seven, eight years and the one that\u2019s turned up in Manchester. They need to get him out of the club now.\u2019\n\nAnd on Fellaini, among others: \u2018They can\u2019t play at this pace. They can\u2019t make the movements of Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Paul Pogba. They are not capable of doing it, they haven\u2019t got the physical attributes.\n\n\u2018Pace is the basis of every team and with Mata, Lukaku and Fellaini, it\u2019s too slow.\u2019\n\nNeville also berates United\u2019s executives for poor recruitment and too many changes of direction. A little consistency from either side wouldn\u2019t go amiss.\n\nHooligans can't dictate agenda\n\nScheduling England\u2019s match against the Czech Republic in Prague on Friday evening is unfortunate, this being the perfect catalyst for a long weekend of stag-do style drinking and mayhem.\n\nYet it is very understandable that UEFA ignored requests for the date of the game to be switched. The onus is on England\u2019s fans to behave, not for the fixture list to protect European cities from their excesses.\n\nAnd if the FA, or the domestic law-enforcement agencies, cannot control them, tournaments will have to go ahead without England.\n\nThe Friday night game in Amsterdam in 2018 was a friendly, and its planning lamentable. That was a game that did not need to be played \u2014 certainly at that time. But this is a UEFA competition. It is played to their rules, not an agenda dictated by hooligans, and if that does not suit, in keeping with the times, we can always leave.\n\nNorwich took a gamble, now reality bites\n\nIs it safe to talk about Norwich now? Is it safe to say that, for all their fine football and noble transfer market ethic, to arrive in the Premier League with such a low level of investment was always asking for trouble?\n\nAt the weekend, with players out, the limitations of that plan showed. Norwich were swept aside, at home, by Aston Villa, a club that bought extensively this summer as a hedge against immediate relegation. Yet, of the two, Norwich are the fashionable ones.\n\nThere is a certain type of aficionado who sneers loftily at owner investment, as if football is merely an arm of accountancy and to spend money is infra dig.\n\nIt was always going to be tough for Norwich in the Premier League with their lack of spending\n\nIt may not work out for Villa, the way it didn\u2019t for Fulham last year. Buying footballers is not an exact science. Yet by retaining Jack Grealish and trying to put superior talents around him, Villa\u2019s owners are doing their best to maintain Premier League status.\n\nIf Daniel Farke keeps Norwich up given the budgetary restrictions, it will be the managerial performance of the season. A club with far more depth would struggle with the injuries Norwich have, yet this was a gamble they chose to take, and were patronisingly lauded for at the time.\n\nNow reality has bit, as was always likely.\n\nWhenever the question is raised about the lack of opportunity for Phil Foden at Manchester City, a list of stellar midfield players is produced. How can he be expected to play ahead of that lot, it is asked.\n\nYet this is the same group who have now lost to Norwich and Wolves and dropped points against an off-colour Tottenham. It\u2019s not like Foden\u2019s trying to get into the Liverpool team, on the back of eight straight wins and the greatest form in the club\u2019s history.\n\nManchester City are two points ahead of Chelsea and Foden would be in at Chelsea.\n\n\u2018We punched through,\u2019 said IAAF president Lord Coe of the disastrous World Championships in Doha. Indeed he did.
