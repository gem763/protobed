Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their orders.\n\nThe Wagner group was thrust into the spotlight last year when three Russian journalists were killed in Central African Republic while investigating its alleged presence there.\n\nRussian private military contractors use a defence ministry base in southern Russia containing barracks that were built by a company linked to businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, Reuters reported in April.\n\nThe United States has sanctioned Prigozhin after it accused him of trying meddle in its 2016 presidential election as well as the U.S. mid-term elections last year.\n\nPrighozin has denied any links to Wagner and has declined to comment on the U.S. allegations, calling them a \u201cprivate matter\u201d for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nConcord Management and Consulting, Prighozin\u2019s main business, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday when asked if he controlled Wagner or whether he or his associates knew anything about or were involved in the harassment campaign against Proekt.\n\nRussia is regularly criticised by media freedom watchdogs who say attacks on journalists in the country often go unpunished. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says 28 journalists have been killed in Russia since 2000.", "description": "A group of Russian journalists who investigated the activities of a secretive group of Russian mercenaries in Africa and the Middle East have been subject to a campaign of physical threats and harassment, their editor-in-chief said.", "authors": ["Anton Zverev", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
