Police said she had been killed in the District. (Family photo)\n\nAfter her mother died of cancer in August of last year, Marquita Lucas tattooed a memorial ribbon on her arm as a tribute.\n\nThat mark was all her family had to identify the 24-year-old in the days after authorities said she was killed in a domestic-related attack in Southeast Washington and her body dumped and set on fire in a field 23 miles away in Bowie.\n\nLucas\u2019s mother, Charlotte Lucas, had died Aug. 4, 2018, at the age of 51. Marquita Lucas\u2019s body was found Aug. 17, the anniversary of her mother\u2019s internment at Glenwood Cemetery in Northeast Washington.\n\nThough Lucas\u2019s family knew from the tattoo that the body was their loved one, they had to wait six weeks until dental records provided final confirmation on Monday. Services will be Oct. 19 at Hunt Funeral Home in Northwest Washington.\n\n\u201cShe was very beautiful, a loving young lady who had her whole life ahead of her,\u201d said Eugena Beard, a close family friend whom Lucas and her siblings called their \u201caunt.\u201d She said Lucas was in her final semester at nursing school, though she was not sure where Lucas was studying, and lived with relatives in Northwest.\n\n\u201cIn one moment, her whole life was snatched from her, unnecessarily,\u201d said Beard, who spoke on behalf of the family.\n\nD.C. police have classified the incident as domestic related, according to the offense report, but have not made an arrest. Authorities declined to elaborate on the investigation or what might have led to the killing.\n\nFirefighters responding to a brush fire found Lucas\u2019s body shortly before 6:15 a.m. on Aug. 17 along Mill Branch Road, near Bowie Town Center and just south of Route 50.\n\nAuthorities said they determined Lucas was killed earlier that day inside a single-family house in the 3700 block of Horner Place SE, near Congress Heights. They have not said how they came to that conclusion or how Lucas died.\n\nBeard said she did not know why Lucas was in Southeast that day.\n\nLucas grew up on Euclid Street near Howard University and was the youngest of five children. When she was 12, her oldest brother, Robert Lucas, was fatally shot during an argument near the old Sursum Corda housing complex. He was 22. Police said the case remains unsolved.\n\nThe surviving siblings \u2014 26-year-old twins and a 33-year-old sister \u2014 have taken Lucas\u2019s death hard. Tina Lucas, now the eldest, \u201cis beating herself up because she felt she should have been there to protect her,\u201d Beard said. Two of the siblings could not be reached for comment, and Tina Lucas, who was with Beard during an interview, did not wish to speak.\n\nMarquita Lucas attended elementary and middle school in the District but for a time lived with relatives in Richmond, where she graduated high school. She moved back to the District and lived with her grandmother and other relatives on Euclid Street.\n\nBeard said Lucas was to start a job at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant the Monday after her body was found, and she planned to work there while she finished nursing school.\n\nBeard described Lucas as stubborn and opinionated, but also as fun-loving and even silly, spending time playing with nephews who ranged in age from 2 to 10 and posting selfies and other pictures on Snapchat and Instagram, adding funny faces and noses.\n\n\u201cShe was always doing something to make her laugh,\u201d Beard said, noting she last talked to Lucas a few weeks before she died and helped her pay her cellphone bill. It was Beard who had taken Lucas to the dentist in 2018, the very visit from which police found records that confirmed her identity.\n\nBeard is the director of a methadone clinic in Southeast and runs a residential drug treatment center in Northwest. She said that after Lucas\u2019s name became public, her clients offered her hugs and condolences.\n\nBeard has been counseling addicts for a quarter century but said the outpouring took her by surprise.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018I saw you on the news. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t know that was your niece,\u2019 \u201d Beard said. \u201cI got overwhelmed. Even though people have substance abuse issues, they\u2019re people, and they have the same feelings and the same empathy and compassions as people who don\u2019t use drugs.\u201d\n\nBeard said she never knew her clients would turn the tables and \u201chelp me get through the day.\u201d She added, \u201cGod sends you help in the strangest of ways.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA mystery 32 stories up: Is a grandfather, 68, leaping of the D.C. area\u2019s tallest buildings?\n\nCoast Guard lieutenant accused of plotting mass attack pleads guilty to gun, drug charges\n\nIG at center of impeachment inquiry promised robust whistleblower protections when he took job\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The 24-year-old nursing student was killed in a domestic-related attack, police say.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
