That should dampen talk here of another Reserve Bank interest rate cut and some sort of budget stimulus before Christmas.\n\nIn both the US-China trade war and Brexit, nothing has been fundamentally resolved. But the worst scenarios have been wound back. With Mr Trump\u2019s so-called phase one trade deal, he will hold fire on a scheduled tariff increase on Chinese imports in return for China buying more American soybeans and pork. After US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Australians in August not to sell their security for a pile of soybeans, Mr Trump has made a political deal to benefit farm-belt voters. This does nothing to meet the President\u2019s fundamental complaints \u2013 backed by Scott Morrison \u2013 that China\u2019s mercantilist model has been unfairly exploiting global trade rules. But nor does it hurt Australia by diverting Chinese demand to American farmers at our expense.\n\nIreland's PM Leo Varadkar with British PM Boris Johnson. Getty\n\nUntil several days ago, everyone seemed to think Mr Johnson would be humiliated in his Churchillian quest to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union that could be accepted by the UK parliament before the October 31 deadline. Then he scored a surprise breakthrough with the Irish prime minister, which the European Union described as \u201cpromising\u201d. It\u2019s a complicated and perhaps very British fudge over the status of Northern Island, where a lot of work remains to be done. But, at least for now, it looks like a kamikaze no-deal Brexit is the least likely result.\n\nThings could be worse as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe prepare to fly out to this week\u2019s International Monetary Fund annual meetings in Washington. But rather than panicky crisis policies, this should encourage the debate to focus more on orthodox policies to promote growth, such as cutting red tape, sharpening the incentives in the tax system and reforming workplace regulation.", "description": "A trade war truce and a path out of the Brexit nightmare should quieten two of the spectres haunting the world economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6565%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1112%2C$y_369/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/99569600c80d2a02e8360a64a88b41aa6472f0fd", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
