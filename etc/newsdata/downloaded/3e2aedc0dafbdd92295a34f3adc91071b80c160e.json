Since October 21.\n\nTrigger? The disputed results of the October 20 presidential election which gave outgoing leader Evo Morales almost outright victory for a fourth term.\n\nState of play?

After a week of protests that quickly escalated into clashes with security forces, the government announced reforms. Protesters continue to demand an end to corruption and unemployment, and an overhaul of the political system. On October 25 the protests resumed, with a new upsurge of violence, fanned by Shiite political leader Moqtada Sadr.\n\nToll? More than 150 dead the first week. At least 12 on Friday alone.\n\n- Ongoing movements -\n\nOther protest movements, which started earlier this year, are continuing:\n\n- In Hong Kong, a protest movement started on June 9 in response to a draft government bill that would allow extradition to mainland China.\n\nAfter months of regular protests, including some of the worst violence the former British colony has known, the extradition bill was withdrawn in September. But the campaign had already broadened to demand greater democratic freedoms.\n\nInitially peaceful, the protests have degenerated into violent clashes between protesters and security forces. Numerous pro-democracy activists have been attacked by supporters of mainland China. On October 1 police shot a protestor with a live bullet but he survived.\n\n- In Algeria, the decision by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to run for a fifth term sparked a wave of peaceful demonstrations on February 22.\n\nBouteflika resigned in April but protesters continue to demand an overhaul of the entire political establishment. The opposition rejects elections under the current establishment, called for December 12.", "description": "The past weeks have seen a wave of often unprecedented protest movements erupt in countries around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A..hZiLELSFQfuYHpQsNWA--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/51f5beb8127c38f2e4a648542e06e4888cdc3c05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
