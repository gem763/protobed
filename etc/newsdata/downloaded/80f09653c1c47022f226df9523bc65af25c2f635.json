Hell, Jurgen Klopp could ask James Milner to put in a shift at his local and he'd do it, no questions asked.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold sidelined by a virus, the majority expected Joe Gomez would get the nod for the champions of Europe. Instead, Klopp opted for the puzzle piece that always fits.\n\nGomez may consider that a snub \u2014 he has started just twice since August \u2014 but Liverpool's Mr Versatile slotted in nicely. Milner, as he so often does, did the job asked of him.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold out with a virus, many expected Joe Gomez would get the nod\n\nHe started at right back. Then when Gomez was brought on midway through the second half, replacing Andy Robertson, Milner moved to left back. He is the man for all occasions.\n\nThe 33-year-old England international \u2014 a free signing from Manchester City in 2015 and whose contract expires at the end of this season \u2014 is considered a model athlete inside football circles.\n\nThose who know the teetotal midfielder describe him as having 'muscles on top of muscles', a 'freak of nature' fitness-wise, and he proved no slouch down the right wing here.\n\nKlopp opted for the puzzle piece that always fits, James Milner \u2013 who captained the side\n\nWhen replacing Alexander-Arnold, that is a must. The 21-year-old's marauding runs are a huge part of Klopp's set-up \u2013 just look at how Manchester United limited his input on Sunday and took a point off the Premier League leaders.\n\nSo to see Milner so high up the pitch, pushing on aggressive, will have pleased Klopp. Occasionally, he was even higher than Mohamed Salah, looking to add to an attack.\n\nThat is not to say there were not issues at the back for the visitors.\n\nIt will have concerned Klopp how easily his side were cut open by Genk's long balls. Inside five minutes, Ally Mbwana Samatta was put through but dragged his shot wide.\n\nHe started at right back then moved to left back after Andy Robertson was brought off\n\nMoments later, a straight ball over the top caught Liverpool out again, with Dejan Lovren spending more time calling for offside than trying to stop the attack. Paul Onuachu forced Alisson into a save, though replays showed a sliding intervention from Milner was crucial behind.\n\nThe Belgian champions certainly caused problems, though perhaps that is to be expected when two vitals members of your defence \u2014 Alexander-Arnold and Joel Matip \u2014 are left at home.\n\nStill, Liverpool got their crucial Champions League win, with Milner again showing his versatility.", "description": "With Trent Alexander-Arnold sidelined by a virus, the majority expected Joe Gomez would get the nod for the champions of Europe.
