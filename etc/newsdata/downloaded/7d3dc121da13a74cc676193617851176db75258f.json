REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nUnder the plan, agreed by presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, Syrian Kurdish forces are to withdraw more than 30 km (19 miles) from the Turkish border, a goal Russia\u2019s RIA news agency, quoting an SDF official, said was already achieved.\n\nRussia said it was sending more military policemen and heavy equipment to help implement the deal, which has already prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to lift sanctions against Turkey and has drawn lavish praise for Erdogan in the Turkish media.\n\nAnkara views the Kurdish YPG militia, the main component in the SDF, as terrorists linked to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey. It launched a cross-border offensive against them on Oct. 9 after Trump ordered U.S. forces out of northeast Syria.\n\nThe deal agreed with Putin, which builds on and widens a previous U.S.-brokered ceasefire, helped end the fighting.\n\nBut the SDF said in its statement on Thursday that Turkish forces had attacked three villages \u201coutside the area of the ceasefire process,\u201d forcing thousands of civilians to flee.\n\n\u201cDespite our forces\u2019 commitment to the ceasefire decision and the withdrawal of our forces from the entire ceasefire area, the Turkish state and the terrorist factions allied to it are still violating the ceasefire process,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOur forces are still clashing,\u201d it said, urging the United States to intervene to halt the renewed fighting.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Turkey, which has previously said it reserves the right to self-defence against any militants who remain in the area despite the truce.\n\n\u2018EVERYTHING IS BEING IMPLEMENTED\u2019\n\nRussia, which as a close ally of President Bashar al-Assad has emerged as the key geopolitical player in Syria, has begun deploying military policemen near the Turkish border as part of the deal agreed on Tuesday in the Russian city of Sochi.\n\n\u201cWe note with satisfaction that the agreements reached in Sochi are being implemented,\u201d Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin as saying.\n\n\u201cEverything is being implemented,\u201d he said.\n\nRIA, citing an SDF official, said the Kurdish fighters had already withdrawn to 32 km (20 miles) away from the border. It also said the Kurds were ready to discuss joining the Syrian army once the crisis in Syria has been settled politically.\n\nRussia will send a further 276 military policemen and 33 units of military hardware to Syria in a week, RIA news agency cited a defence ministry source as saying.\n\nNext Tuesday, under the terms of the Sochi deal, Russian and Turkish forces will start to patrol a 10 km strip of land in northeast Syria where U.S. troops had for years been deployed along with their former Kurdish allies.\n\nThe arrival of the Russian police marks a shift in the regional balance of power just two weeks after Trump pulled out U.S. forces, in a move widely criticised in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of the Americans\u2019 former Kurdish allies.\n\nThe Russian deployments have also further highlighted increasingly close ties between Russia and NATO member Turkey.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking in Brussels on Thursday ahead of a NATO meeting, said Turkey - which annoyed Washington this year by buying Russian-made S400 missile defence systems - was moving in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cWe see them spinning closer to Russia\u2019s orbit than in the Western orbit and I think that is unfortunate,\u201d Esper said.\n\n\u2018SUPER-POWER OF PEACE\u2019\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s lifting of sanctions on Turkey, distrust persists between Ankara and Washington, and a top Erdogan aide on Thursday criticised U.S. politicians for treating SDF commander Mazloum Kobani as a \u201clegitimate political figure.\u201d\n\nThe aide, Fahrettin Altun, told Reuters that Mazloum was a senior leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency in southeast Turkey and which Ankara\u2019s Western allies also deem a terrorist group.\n\nRepublican and Democratic U.S. senators urged the State Department on Wednesday to quickly provide a visa to Mazloum so he can visit the United States to discuss the situation in Syria.\n\nThe Turkish public has shown strong support for the military operation, encouraged by an overwhelmingly pro-government media.\n\n\u201cThe super-power of peace, Turkey,\u201d said the main headline in Thursday\u2019s edition of the pro-government Sabah newspaper.\n\nAn opinion poll published by pollster Areda Survey last week showed more than three quarters of Turks supported the so-called Operation Peace Spring. The findings were based on the responses of 2,160 people between Oct. 11-14.\n\nHowever, the incursion has deepened a sense of alienation among Turkey\u2019s Kurds, which is also being fuelled by a crackdown on the country\u2019s main pro-Kurdish party.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nKurds make up some 18% of Turkey\u2019s 82 million people.\n\nTurkey\u2019s military operation was widely condemned by its NATO allies, which said it was causing a fresh humanitarian crisis in Syria\u2019s eight-year conflict and could let Islamic State prisoners held by the YPG escape and regroup.", "description": "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused Turkey on Thursday of launching a large land offensive targeting three villages in northeast Syria despite a truce, but Russia said a peace plan hammered out this week was going ahead smoothly.", "authors": ["Tom Perry", "Maria Kiselyova", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444505048&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N169", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
