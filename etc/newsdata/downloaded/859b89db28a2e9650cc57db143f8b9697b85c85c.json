Joseph Crowley of New York and Michael Capuano of Massachusetts, who lost in primary races last year to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, respectively.\n\n\u201cThey were both 10-term incumbents who had been in Washington for a long time who lost their race by challenge[s] on the left \u2014 not because of a competitive congressional district, but because of a competitive primary,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lewandowski delivered a defiant performance at a contentious hearing on Tuesday but said there was no \u201cpreconceived\u201d determination not to answer questions from lawmakers on the judiciary committee.\n\n\u201cWe were there with no preconceived decision to not answer questions \u2014 the White House asked for us to preserve the privilege of private conversation with the president,\u201d the former campaign manager said.\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s just be clear \u2014 it\u2019s not my privilege to preserve,\u201d he added. \u201cSo as the White House directed, I agreed to that and that\u2019s what the White House asked for.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
