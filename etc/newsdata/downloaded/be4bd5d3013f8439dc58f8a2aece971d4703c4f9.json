Ltd., contained a clicker Trojan malware designed to commit ad fraud by clicking links sans any user interaction.\n\nThey were also found to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server to trigger targeted advertising and even subscribing users to premium services without their knowledge.\n\nInterestingly, this C2 server was flagged back in August by Dr. Web researchers, as part of a similar clicker trojan campaign on Android.\n\nBut in a strange turn of events, the same developer\u2019s Android apps were not communicating with the identified C2 server.\n\nCredit: Wandera The malicious iOS apps\n\nArtificially boosting ad revenues through fake ad clicks is a clear-cut case of App Store policy violation. So, it\u2019s easy to see why Apple promptly took action.\n\nMobile malware threats\n\nMalicious apps have continued to plague official app stores both for iOS and Android, as smartphones have proven to be a lucrative attack surface for criminals to carry out highly targeted campaigns.\n\n\u201cTechniques like those used in this example also point to more instances of malware being introduced into official app sources, making it more accessible to everyday consumers and mobile workers alike,\u201d Wandera said.\n\nAlthough Apple and Google\u2019s official app stores are the safest places to download apps, malware-ridden apps have found one way or the other to get around the security checkpoints and slide into the platforms.\n\n\u201cSneaking unwanted or harmful functionality into popular, benign apps is a common practice among \u2018bad\u2019 developers,\u201d the researchers said, underscoring the need for carefully scrutinizing each app and their permissions before downloading them.\n\nIf you have installed one of the apps, you should waste no time removing them from your devices.\n\nRead next: Pardon the Intrusion #3: it's 2FA or bust", "description": "Apple and Google have cumulatively removed over 50 apps from their respective mobile app stores that were found serving malicious ads to millions of users.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F08%2Fgoogle-play-store-apps-malware.jpg&signature=ffe18d83f8a328018ff45d068ef5818f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
