Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s retort to those charges came in a three-word mantra that now forms the central theme of the White House impeachment response: \u201cGet over it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet \u2014 and potentially illegal \u2014 part out loud.\n\nBut that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney\u2019s appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.\n\nWhile Mulvaney came to the briefing room to announce the 2020 G-7 site, his most significant comments came when he described why Trump had intervened over the summer to block nearly $400 million in aid Congress had appropriated for Ukraine. Democrats are probing Trump\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox Ukraine policy as part of their impeachment investigation, and several members of Trump\u2019s administration have said they were uncomfortable with the president\u2019s use of diplomatic pressure for apparent political ends.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney first said the president blocked the aid because he was concerned about corruption in Ukraine and the lack of European support for the country. And then, he indicated that the president\u2019s political interests were also at play.\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely, no question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nThe reference to the hacked Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server elevated a Trump-backed conspiracy theory that Ukraine was involved in election interference in 2016, something U.S. intelligence officials have repeatedly attributed to Russia.\n\nAD\n\nIn admitting that Trump had linked politics with his Ukraine policy, Mulvaney said that critics were simply overreacting.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe reviews for Mulvaney\u2019s performance came in swiftly, and even the president\u2019s allies were unimpressed with his admit-everything approach. The comments were widely derided in the West Wing, and it launched an hours-long scramble to issue a new statement, according to White House officials.\n\n\u201cTotally inexplicable,\u201d said one GOP lawmaker, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. \u201cHe literally said the thing the president and everyone else said did not happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, which also included a request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nIn his statement distancing himself from his earlier comments, Mulvaney blamed the media and echoed Trump\u2019s denials of a quid pro quo.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\n\n\nBut during the news briefing, he answered affirmatively when asked if there was a quid pro quo, and said, \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy.\u201d\n\nA prep session held in Mulvaney\u2019s office ahead of the news conference with White House lawyers and press staff, as well as State Department officials, focused mostly on G-7 questions, according to two officials familiar with the meeting.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo one expected him to go out there and say what he said,\u201d one of the people said with regard to his Ukraine comments.\n\nThe Department of Justice also distanced itself from Mulvaney\u2019s assertion that Trump\u2019s request for a foreign probe into the Democrats\u2019 email server was simply an ask for Ukraine to \u201ccooperate with an ongoing, public investigation into wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\u201d a Justice Department official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to contradict the acting White House chief of staff.\n\n\u201cI think Mulvaney should rethink ever stepping in front of a microphone,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a book about previous White House chiefs of staff.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier in the briefing, Mulvaney sought to preemptively defend Trump\u2019s decision to select the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort for the G-7. The unprecedented move, denounced by good governance groups, could require seven world leaders and hundreds of officials to spend money at a Trump-owned property. Trump is already facing lawsuits for allegedly violating the Constitution\u2019s ban on receiving \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign governments.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnticipating your questions, how is this not an emoluments violation? Is the president going to profit from this?\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cI think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he\u2019s got here that he doesn\u2019t profit from being here.\u201d\n\nWhile he did not elaborate on the legal matter, Mulvaney went on at length to praise the property\u2019s amenities during the televised briefing, citing its 900 acres, three golf courses and \u201cperfect\u201d common areas. He dismissed arguments that the financially struggling resort would benefit from the publicity that comes with hosting a prestigious summit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDoral was far and away the best physical facility for this meeting,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nClaiming that the administration examined 10 sites before choosing the president\u2019s own, Mulvaney quoted an anonymous site selection official who agreed with his effusive assessment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey said \u2018Mick, you\u2019re not going to believe this, but it\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nMulvaney did not say what other sites were vetted. But he did say how Trump\u2019s property got on the list of properties under consideration: Trump suggested it.\n\n\u201cWe had the list, and he goes, \u2018What about Doral?\u2019 Mulvaney said, recounting the president\u2019s comments in the White House dining room. \u201cAnd it was like that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s not the craziest idea.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter a nationwide search, Trump administration employees selected the property suggested by Trump, Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nWhipple said Mulvaney\u2019s strategy has been to try to normalize Trump\u2019s un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox behavior by making the \u201cinsane\u201d seem commonplace.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s actions are not defendable so the response is \u2018Let\u2019s just act like this is normal,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing normal about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney\u2019s twin admissions Thursday put him out of step with some of the president\u2019s own officials, underscoring the lack of a unified GOP approach as Trump faces impeachment.\n\nSeveral State Department officials have told congressional investigators they objected to Trump\u2019s push to give his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a central role in Ukraine policy. Mulvaney said there was nothing wrong with it. While Trump\u2019s handpicked ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told Congress that he was uncomfortable with Giuliani\u2019s role, Mulvaney offered a rebuttal in the White House press briefing room.\n\n\u201cYou may not like the fact that Giuliani was involved. That\u2019s great, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, referring to Sondland\u2019s testimony, which was taking place at the same time Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal. It\u2019s not impeachable. The president gets to use who he wants to use.\u201d\n\nFew Republicans publicly backed Trump\u2019s move to host the G-7 at his own property, and some actively spoke out against it.\n\nAri Fleischer, who was a White House press secretary for president George W. Bush, said Trump\u2019s G-7 decision was \u201cunseemly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolding the G-7 at a Trump property is one of the most foolish, unseemly things the WH could do,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe President enjoys waiving red flags in front of bulls, but this fight isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d", "description": "In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet \u2014 and potentially illegal \u2014 part out loud.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nnxPf8H7ch2H_dXQ5_azDOuPJOg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CQ4XVWXRGAI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
