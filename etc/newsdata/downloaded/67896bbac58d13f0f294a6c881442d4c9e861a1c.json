The bug that they tried desperately to bury three years ago has become the defining feature of the product.\n\nIn other words: You don\u2019t choose Trump over Walsh in spite of \u201csend her back\u201d and all the rest. You choose Trump over Walsh because of it.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s what Republican voters do, it will be clarifying. Is it helpful? Perhaps not, in terms of the long-run future of the Republican party or the conservative movement.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Last", "Thebulwark.Com Newsletter-Issue Joe-Walsh-Is-Here-To-Reveal-What-Republicans-Really-Think-About-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
