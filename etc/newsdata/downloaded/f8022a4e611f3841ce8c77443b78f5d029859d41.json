The group, headed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign press secretary Brian Fallon, aims to stop President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell\u2019s legendary reshaping of the federal judiciary system.\n\nThese people are radicals. This list is a dream come true for far left activists who seek to turn the courts into a political super-legislature. https://t.co/AIPzWfNFyv \u2014 Carrie Severino (@JCNSeverino) October 15, 2019\n\nDemand Justice\u2019s list of endorsed nominees for the highest court includes few with actual judicial experience, but many far-left activists. Out of the 32 names on the group\u2019s list, only eight have judicial experience on their resume. Although alarming, this is not entirely surprising coming from a far-left group. President Trump and Leader McConnell have broken every record on the books for judicial confirmations, including putting two well-qualified jurists on the Supreme Court. The federal court system is finally returning to normalcy, with the rule of law as priority once again.\n\nDuring the 2016 GOP primary, then-candidate Donald Trump famously released a list of names he would consider for a Supreme Court vacancy; this had yet to be done in a contested presidential primary. His list included appeals court judges, state supreme court justices and federal circuit court judges; with the exception of Senator Mike Lee (R, UT), all of the names on Trump\u2019s list had tangible judicial experience.\n\nPresident Trump has proved to the American people, although many conservatives had reservations, that he will exclusively nominate well-qualified jurists to the courts, based on their judicial philosophy. This list released by Demand Justice proves that Democrats want to nominate activists who will obey their radical agenda and legislate from the bench, rather than obey the rule of law.\n\nDemand Justice hopes that primary contenders will endorse potential SCOTUS nominees from this list, but President Trump\u2019s judicial overhaul is popular among voters. The 2018 midterm elections, although they brought Democratic victories in the House of Representatives, proved that the Kavanaugh smear process mattered to voters. Every Democratic senator who faced a contested re-election fight, who also voted against the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh, lost their re-election bid. Democratic primary contenders would be smart to remember this.", "description": "Ahead of the fourth Democratic primary debate, far-left interest group Demand Justice released a list of 32 potential nominees for the Supreme Court as suggestions to the primary contenders..10/19/2019 6:46:16AM EST.", "authors": ["Reagan Mccarthy", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/townhall/reu/o/2018/337/f88820d5-2187-4a45-b6a7-3aa49830a7d4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
