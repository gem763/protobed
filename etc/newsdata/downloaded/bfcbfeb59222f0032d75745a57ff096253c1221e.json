Since 1976, most summer games in the northern hemisphere have been held in the middle of summer to fit global broadcasting and sports schedules.\n\nTokyo organizers have tried other measures, such as vapor sprays, shaded or air-conditioned rest areas and distribution of water and ice packs, at a beach volleyball test event in July.\n\nOfficials measured the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which factors in temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, as rising as high as 31.7, exceeding a threshold of 31 at which Tokyo authorities urge citizens against exercise.\n\nTo avoid the hottest part of the day, the marathons will start at 6 a.m., with major roads on much of the 26-mile (42 km) route surfaced with a resin-based material organizers say will reflect infrared rays to cut its temperature as much as 8 degrees C.\n\nLast month, heat concerns prompted the International Triathlon Union to shorten the distance of the run segment in a qualifying event in Tokyo for the July 24-Aug. 9 Olympics.\n\nSeveral days earlier, several athletes competing in the 2019 World Rowing Junior Championships were treated for heatstroke, media said.", "description": "In a bid to keep visitors cool in blistering temperatures expected during next year's Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games, organizers may deploy machines to sprinkle spectators with manmade snow.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
