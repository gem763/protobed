He is a classic know-it-all, and regularly changes the subject mid-conversation to tell random stories about himself. My mother acts like his personal hype-man: \"Oh, Steve is the best,\" about absolutely everything. The best driver, best at talking to people, best handyman, etc.\n\nI think the constant compliments are an attempt at getting us to like him, but it's done the opposite: My sister and I are frustrated both by him and her behavior with him.\n\nOn top of this, my mother is incredibly defensive about any sort of critique; if you didn't care for her favorite food, for example, she would take it personally.\n\nAll of that is challenging, but not intolerable.\n\nHowever, I have an 18-month-old and my sister has an 8-month-old. Our mother frequently refers to Steve as \"Grandpa\" \u2014 except he's not their grandfather, and also not our father figure since we were adults when they met.\n\nDuring a recent two-day visit, she called him Grandpa (\"Give Grandpa a hug!\" \"Go say hi to Grandpa!\") no fewer than 50 TIMES; that's where we stopped counting.\n\nMy son also has two living grandfathers, and it feels disrespectful to them.\n\nMy sister hates it, but she handles it better. My husband cannot stand it, either. Steve makes it clear he thinks I'm uptight and high-strung; in his defense, he's not totally wrong, because I am uptight and high-strung in his presence.\n\nIs it wrong to want him no longer referred to as Grandpa? Is there a way to bring it up without upsetting anyone too much?\n\n\u2014 Don't Need a Step-Grandpa\n\nDon\u2019t Need a Step-Grandpa: Right, the magical non-upsetting way to tell people you don\u2019t like them.\n\nThat\u2019s really all this is.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not wrong; you\u2019re entitled to your dislikes, which sound well-earned here. It isn\u2019t wrong specifically to want Steve not to be \u201cGrandpa\u201d and your mom to stop pathetically pushing the sale.\n\nBut it\u2019s also not useful, either. Refusing won\u2019t make Steve any more charming, will it? Plus, your mom is already needy and obsessive about Steve\u2019s approval rating among her kids. Imagine how she\u2019ll respond to such an explicit, symbolic rejection.\n\nImagine \u201cHug GRANDPA!!\u201d times 100. I can\u2019t do it bearably, and I don\u2019t even have to be there.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Recognize your problem is with your mom. Steve\u2019s just collateral damage.\n\n2. Drop the Grandpa war as unwinnable. \u201cGrandpa Steve.\u201d Whatever. Besides, he is/could be the kids\u2019 grandpa figure \u2014 with no disrespect to you or others, since caring isn\u2019t finite.\n\n3. Develop your own multifaceted sanity kid for the Mom Show. Indulge her a little when it doesn\u2019t cost you much emotionally; push back a little when you need to on principle; make nice to her and/or Steve a little, leave the room a little, play Mom-Brags-on-Steve Bingo a little. Concentrate a lot on seeing the good. Difficult people are great at teaching us to be resourceful.\n\n4. Trust the littles to mispronounce \u201cGrandpa Steve\u201d \u2014 then, especially if the kids love him and/or he\u2019s good to them, welcome \u201cGoopy\u201d/\u201cSkeezy\u201d/\u201dPesky\u201d as your blue sky after Mom\u2019s self-inflicted storm.\n\nShe is, after all, far more at fault here than Steve is. Remaining mindful of that can help you not lose your mind.", "description": "A woman\u2019s mother wants her grandchildren to call her boyfriend \u201cGrandpa.\u201d", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
