He has launched two courses on making better decisions and building better habits.\n\nHe writes that studies show open-minded people may be living in a different reality \u2014 your mood and openness can even impact how you visually see the world.\n\nBut people who are less open to alternative realities take longer to improve in life.\n\nTo cultivate openness, you can try practicing meditation and training yourself to be open to new things.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nHuman awareness is highly limited. What gets your attention also prevents you from seeing the whole picture \u2014 unexpected objects go unnoticed when attention is focused elsewhere.\n\nWe subconsciously ignore specific facts, data, and knowledge because of what we are conditioned to observe or look out for.\n\nMounting evidence suggests that our personality traits affect our experience of the world and shape the course of our lives \u2014 it determines the information you choose to focus on.\n\nYour reality determines the choices you make in life.\n\nThere are two kinds of people in the world \u2014 those with a closed mindset and those who are ridiculously open-minded to new experiences.\n\nA psychological study conducted by researchers Anna Antinori, Olivia L. Carter, and Luke D. Smillie revealed that open-minded people may live in a completely different reality. They found that openness and mood can affect how you visually perceive the world, which can affect creativity.\n\nResearch shows that your personality traits (patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving) not only change your outlook on life but also change the way you perceive reality at work, and how you relate with family, friends, and romantic partners.\n\nEven your life satisfaction, emotional well-being, physical health, and longevity are largely influenced by your personality and life circumstances.\n\nThomas Oppong.

Openness to experience is characterized by flexible cognition \u2014 open people are more curious, creative, and motivated to explore the world and engage with possibilities.\n\nPeople high in openness are more likely to experience the world differently to the average person as a result of their \"breadth, depth, and permeability of consciousness, and \u2026 [their] \u2026 recurrent need to enlarge and examine experience,\" according to the Journal of Research in Personality.\n\nPeople who find it hard to consider other alternative realities in life and work take longer to make a significant improvement in life.\n\nIn his book \"Principles: Life and Work,\" Ray Dalio, a self-made billionaire, argues that \"Closed-minded people don't want their ideas challenged. They are typically frustrated that they can't get the other person to agree with them instead of curious as to why the other person disagrees.\"\n\nDalio encourages us to embrace different perspectives not only at work but in all areas of our lives. He recommends we develop the art of thoughtful disagreement.\n\nHe explains, \"When two people believe opposite things, chances are that one of them is wrong. It pays to find out if that someone is you. That's why I believe you must appreciate and develop the art of thoughtful disagreement. In thoughtful disagreement, your goal is not to convince the other party that you are right \u2014 it is to find out which view is true and decide what to do about it.\"\n\nPeople with a narrow perspective are more interested in proving themselves right than in getting the best outcome. They often focus much more on being understood than on understanding others.\n\nWhen you find yourself exhibiting these behaviours that may be hindering your progress in life and at work, acknowledge what's happening and deliberately make the effort to correct it.\n\nDon't blame yourself. Everyone has blind spots (our way of thinking that prevents us from seeing things accurately). We can only aim to improve our realities and outlook in life.\n\nThe good news is, while personality traits are relatively stable over time, there is mounting evidence that personality is malleable \u2014 they can and often do gradually change across the life span. If you focus on improving your realities, those changes are usually for the better.\n\nOne study has shown that meditation can affect binocular rivalry, and training can make people more open to new experiences.\n\nOpenness to new experiences is not impossible. Look for opportunities to improve, broaden, and expand your realities. Enhance your cognitive abilities by raising your level of open-mindedness.\n\nMake time to think about everything you do \u2014 are you just doing the same old thing you've always done or could you embrace new experiences, or liven up the way you do things with a slight effort?\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald once said, \"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\"\n\n\"You're acting mindfully when you don't simply dismiss activities and thoughts because they seem unappealing or even silly at first,\" said Ellen Langer, Ph.D., a Harvard psychologist.\n\nChange your perspective by practicing open-mindedness. By learning better ways to make your life awesome, not only do you grow but also encourage your colleagues and loved ones to become better versions of themselves.\n\nThomas Oppong is the founding editor of Alltopstartups, a resource site for young entrepreneurs, and the curator of Postanly, a weekly digest of the best posts about behavior change that affect wealth, health, and productivity.
