Two minutes of prayer, visualization, meditation for those in the way of the storm.\u201d\n\nMs. Williams, a best-selling author and self-help guru, deleted the tweet after being mocked online before re-stating her sentiments differently.\n\n\u201cPrayers for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. May the peace of God be upon them and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm,\u201d Ms. Williamson tweeted later.\n\nPatricia Ewing, a campaign spokeswoman for Ms. Williamson, said in a statement that the candidate\u2019s since-deleted tweet was meant to be a metaphor, multiple outlets reported.\n\n\u201cWhen others speak of prayer and the mind it\u2019s considered profound, but Williamson is held to a different standard,\u201d said the statement. \u201cBecause the comment led to confusion it was replaced.\u201d\n\nMs. Williams doubled down later Wednesday afternoon from her personal Twitter account, meanwhile.\n\n\u201cPrayer is a power of the mind, and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent. People of faith belong in the Democratic Party, and will be necessary to the effort if we\u2019re to win in 2020,\u201d Ms. Williamson tweeted.\n\n\u201cMillions of people today are praying that Dorian turn away from land, and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized Left has lost lots of voters,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nMs. Williamson, 67, is among 20 candidates who qualified to participate in the first two presidential primary debates organized by the Democratic National Committee in June and July; she failed to meet the requirements to compete in the third debate scheduled to take place in Texas on September 12, though she could still qualify to take place in the fourth debate recently set for Oct. 15.\n\nDorian touched down in the Bahamas over the weekend as a Category 5 storm before veering toward Florida in anticipation of moving up the East Coast.\n\nMs. Williamson has frequently discussed spirituality on the campaign trail and has previously called for a \u201cmoral and spiritual awakening\u201d in order to \u201cfundamentally change the patterns of our political dysfunction.\u201d\n\nThe results of a poll released last week by Quinnipiac University found that roughly 1% of Democrats recently surveyed said that they would vote for Ms. Williamson over her fellow White House hopefuls. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden leads the pack with 32%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent, according to Quinnipiac.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
