This next generation of apps will focus on mixing real-life, physical elements with digital ones, and it will emphasize experiences \u201coutside of the glass,\u201d says Adobe chief technology officer Abhay Parasnis. They\u2019ll also be interconnected through mobile and desktop experiences so that users can switch between apps on any device.\n\n\u201cEvery app we\u2019re building \u2014 Aero, Fresco, Photoshop on the iPad \u2014 you will see us push to be cloud native, making collaboration a lot simpler,\u201d Parasnis told The Verge. Perhaps the best example of the future Adobe envisions is another project that\u2019s still in development called Project Glasswing. It\u2019s a mixed-reality display prototype that would bring all of Adobe\u2019s apps into the real world in the form of Photoshop or After Effects layers on a transparent screen in front of real 3D objects.\n\nParasnis stopped by The Verge to demonstrate all of the apps in development on an iPad Pro, starting with Fresco, the upcoming raster and vector illustration app for the iPad. He drew some brush strokes on the canvas, saved it, then opened the same file in Photoshop for the iPad, where the brush strokes remained. Parasnis says the goal is to make the apps \u201cfeel the same, not just in the UI, but in the paradigm of cloud documents.\u201d Files should seem local, while the actual work is happening in the cloud, instantly syncing and saving every change.\n\nThe watercolor brushes in #AdobeFresco are so satisfying to watch. pic.twitter.com/sTPqxXumTl \u2014 Howard Pinsky (@Pinsky) June 19, 2019\n\nFresco, which is meant to mimic how watercolors and oil paints behave on paper, is the culmination of eight years of research using Adobe Sensei\u2019s AI platform. The first version required high-end GPUs to run the engines, and a big part of the research time was spent making sure that the realistic strokes wouldn\u2019t drain battery life and performance. \u201cTo an artist, nothing is worse than feeling like there\u2019s already a level of interaction with a glass and a digital screen,\u201d Parasnis says. For Adobe\u2019s research team, cutting down the latency and getting the brushes and paints to mix naturally in real time represents several breakthroughs.\n\nWhat Fresco is meant to achieve by bringing the analog painting experience into digital screens, Project Aero aims for the opposite. The augmented reality authoring tool allows for designers to create immersive experiences through the Adobe tools they already know how to use without having to know how to code. According to Parasnis, Aero started with the question of \u201cCan we take digital output of creations from Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Dimension, and seamlessly bring them to life in physical 3D spaces around us?\u201d\n\nAero was previewed at Apple\u2019s developer conference last year, where Adobe announced that it would work with an AR file format created by Apple and Pixar. The unified format \u2014 USDZ, which is limited to iOS for now \u2014 means that files can be exported to show up in iPhones on regular apps like iMessage and Safari, without having to download separate AR viewers.\n\nThe app lets artists use drag-and-drop modules to create animations and responsive AR experiences that automatically take into account factors like physics and lighting, which would normally require knowledge of programs like Unity and Apple\u2019s ARKit. Aero also gives artists the ability to fine-tune their AR creations using 3D textures and materials from Substance, the texturing software by Allegorithmic, which Adobe recently acquired. A handful of artists have access to the closed beta of Aero, but the app is taking requests for early access here.\n\nStill, Parasnis recognizes the limits of AR, which binds users to screens and requires devices to look at the world. \u201cFor AR and immersive to go mainstream, both the hardware and the software has to happen,\u201d Parasnis says. Adobe\u2019s solution to that is Project Glasswing, a transparent LCD display that could potentially be used in retail environments or public spaces like hotels and museums. The prototype display can blend digital and physical environments without the need for glasses and headsets. \u201cWe like it as an alternative form of AR,\u201d he says.\n\nParasnis stresses that Project Glasswing isn\u2019t a hardware product; instead, it\u2019s a means for Adobe to showcase how its software can be used in real-life applications, especially in retail. Adobe intends to partner with other companies to \u201ctake the hardware forward\u201d because, Parasnis says, \u201cWe don\u2019t actually want to be in the business of making the display.\u201d\n\nFor retailers worried about how to compete with Amazon, Parasnis thinks AR has the potential to give them an advantage. \u201cIf I can make my physical retail environment and spaces more interactive,\u201d he says, \u201cit gives users a reason to actually leave their screens and go into physical spaces.\u201d", "description": "Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis reveals the future of the company\u2019s apps in Project Aero, Glasswing, Fresco, and Photoshop on the iPad.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYToxDEMqzXBGfYqG9ewSJY0cUY=/0x13:837x451/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18942513/Screen_Shot_2019_08_08_at_10.28.57_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-08-09"}
