Photo: Seth Wenig//AP/Shutterstock\n\nNew York has finally decided that tossing troubled people into an antiquated dungeon, ensuring that they come out even more deeply wounded than when they went in, brings shame to a nominally civilized city. The isolated warren of cells, pens, yards, and trailers on Rikers Island \u2014 \u201ca penal colony in the middle of the East River,\u201d as council speaker Corey Johnson puts it \u2014 has been sentenced to close, part of a planned overhaul of the criminal-justice system that aims to halve the jail population by 2026. All of this seems hopeful, hugely expensive, and possibly quixotic.\n\nThe city is betting big on architecture. At the heart of the transformation is a plan to distribute detainees among four new high-rises, close to the courthouses of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. It will take an estimated seven years and nearly $9 billion to rehouse the equivalent of a small college\u2019s student body into secure vertical dorms. That\u2019s more than it will cost to rebuild LaGuardia airport, which serves 30 million passengers a year. These are optimistic uses of the future tense: Before the last ribbon is cut, those estimates will almost certainly come to seem quaint, shredded by delays, lawsuits, overruns, abuses, and waste. Meanwhile, nobody will want to spend serious money to rehab a doomed facility, and as the years go by, Rikers will decay ever more drastically, doing ever more damage along the way.\n\nAround the country, law-and-order conservatives have insisted that the most effective way to clamp down on crime, fight drugs, and cope with extreme mental illness was to build more jails. Here, progressive politicians counter that the best way to save to reintegrate detainees into society, reduce the preposterous costs of keeping them locked up, dismantle the prison-industrial complex, and reap the dividend that comes with lower crime rates is to \u2026 build more jails. At the far end of the debate are No New Jails activists, who see incarceration as a perpetual instrument of racist oppression: You can\u2019t design a more civilized detention facility, they say, any more than you can bludgeon someone gently.\n\nMaybe a new generation of hyperexpensive confinement is truly the best or, at any rate, the unavoidable option. It\u2019s certainly good to see politicians plan for a future that will arrive well after they\u2019ve left office. But we should be skeptical about architecture\u2019s ability to solve social problems on its own. So far, the de Blasio administration\u2019s two-year-old strategy to reduce homelessness by building an archipelago of shelters has had no perceptible impact.\n\nOr consider the precedent of public housing. In the second half of the 20th century, the powerful and well-intentioned decreed that the poor were living in irredeemable squalor; the only way to rescue them en masse was to tear down their neighborhoods and move them to modern, sanitary structures. For a while, it worked, especially in New York, where housing projects were generally sturdy, airy, and safe. It did not take long, though, for stinginess and prejudice to take hold. Light bulbs went unreplaced, elevators unrepaired, residents unheard. Drug dealers commandeered playgrounds and darkened stairwells, police stayed out, and parents kept their children away from open windows where they could be hit by stray bullets. The new solution for desperate poverty was to undo the previous solution: Authorities memorably dynamited the Pruitt\u2013Igoe housing project in St. Louis in 1972, and more recently demolished the Cabrini\u2013Green project in Chicago. The same logic held in London, when the council housing estate Robin Hood Gardens has come down over the last two years. These were failures of funding, politics, and social glue, but architecture was sold as the cure and so it got the blame.\n\nFor as long as there have been prisons full of abjection and despair, there have been plans to replace them with showcases of decency. London\u2019s ancient house of horrors, Newgate Prison (a quick stroll from the courthouse, as New York\u2019s new detention centers will be), had a demonic reputation, and it was demolished and rebuilt many times, only to revert to its old miseries. When one of those ever-more-modern iterations opened, it was soon overwhelmed by untreated mental illness. In his book London: The Biography, the historian Peter Ackroyd quotes an early-19th-century report on conditions at Newgate: \u201cLunatics ranged up and down the hallways, a terror to all they encountered.\u201d The prison was definitively demolished at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nRikers Island, too, began as an enlightened showcase. In 1886, when conditions (and porous security arrangements) in city jails like the Tombs horrified reformers, the city was already contemplating \u201can enormous model penitentiary, ample in size to serve for many years to come, and which \u2026 should be the most perfect prison in the world.\u201d It took nearly 50 years before the offshore, purportedly escape-proof complex opened with a planned capacity of 2,200. Within seven years, the commissioner of corrections complained that he had no choice but to cram in 3,000 residents, using machine rooms for the overflow.\n\nRikers in 1935.

In New York, the jail population has fallen from a peak of 22,000 in 1991 to 7,000 today, and the goal is to get it to 3,300, the lowest number since 1920. Depending on whom you ask, that\u2019s either too many or too few. Projecting that steep a drop assumes that the era of falling crime and compassionate corrections will stretch into the distant future. The city hopes to nudge the trend along by spending $391 million to transform the criminal-justice system from a bureaucracy of punishment into a social service agency, providing mental-health treatment, \u201cviolence interruption,\u201d and various other programs meant to keep people out of jail. Not so fast, respond hardened pessimists: Crime can roar back at any moment, and when it does, we\u2019re going to need somewhere to stash a surging population of criminals. Predictions follow politics, but crime may have a dynamic of its own.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of what the city will be getting for its $9 billion. A well-ordered jail is not just a storage shed for human beings; it\u2019s a place where defendants who have yet to face trial can prepare for their defense, keep busy, stay safe, and get ready for the outside world. Rikers keeps them focused on merely staying alive. There, moving prisoners around is a cumbersome proposition. Hallways can be treacherous, gates unwieldy. Every day, corrections officers load groups from Rikers onto buses and transport them to an assortment of courthouses and back. Lawyers have to set aside half a day to visit each client. Family members often can\u2019t get there at all.\n\nNew jails can ease those transitions. James Krueger, a principal at the California-based architecture firm HMC, which designed the widely praised Las Colinas Women\u2019s Detention Facility in San Diego, says that architecture can help flip the ratio of carrots to sticks. His firm designed six different levels of security within the same compound, with a goal of granting inmates as much autonomy as they can handle. \u201cWe want to incentivize good behavior through degrees of freedom,\u201d Krueger says. \u201cYou can start out in level three and work your way down to level one, where you can walk to your classes and from one building to another without being escorted. You\u2019re living on campus, but you need to be able to go for a walk and have a conversation with a friend or a counselor.\u201d\n\nArchitects frequently beat the drum for the power of design to engineer society and improve lives. Those are not empty claims, but they should be tempered by modesty. One recent trend in hospitals and schools is evidence-based design, which translates data into some pretty common-sense techniques. Just the presence of a window improves patients\u2019 health and students\u2019 ability to learn. Old-style concrete-and-steel boxes amplify noise, pummeling detainees with constant, panic-inducing reverberations. New facilities can create a softer acoustic environment, giving bruised minds a chance to heal \u2014 and making it easier for officers to figure out where an anomalous noise is coming from.\n\nLas Colinas, like most of the daylight-filled Scandinavian-style models that reform advocates promote, spreads out horizontally like a suburban high school. New York\u2019s new jails will be towers surrounded by other towers, which makes getting detainees daylight and fresh air, for instance, a uniquely urban logistical puzzle. It also means building in costly redundancies, superwide stairwells, powerful ventilation systems, extra elevators, and outdoor spaces on almost every floor, which helps to explain the price tag.\n\n\u201cWe use a \u2018podular\u2019 approach,\u201d says Jeff Goodale, an architect who directs the Justice Group at the large firm HOK and who designed the startlingly airy Maple Street Correctional Facility in San Mateo, California. \u201cYou have 24 to 64 inmates in a unit and all the services they need \u2014 outdoor recreation, food, counseling, medication \u2014 are provided right there. That way, you\u2019re not moving inmates throughout the facility.\u201d\n\nThe dayroom at HOK\u2019s Maple Street Correctional Facility in San Mateo, California. Photo: HOK\n\nThe far deeper challenge lies in alleviating a culture of brutality that can defeat any design. Architecture can express empathy; it can\u2019t manufacture it. Goodale is bullish on design\u2019s ability to improve behavior. \u201cA third of the people who are in a facility every day are staff, and they may spend many years working there,\u201d he points out. \u201cIf the space they\u2019re in makes them feel less stressed, less burdened, and less overwhelmed, that has a positive impact on how they manage the inmates.\u201d I hope he\u2019s right, but I doubt that any building can force guards to treat their charges with respect if they\u2019re inclined to see them as objects, or dissuade detainees from taking their frustrations out on each other. Eventually, any structure can fail under the weight of hostility and neglect, no matter how much it costs.", "description": "Justin Davidson on the Plan to Close Rikers Island and Replace it With $9 Billion in New Jails, and Why It Won\u2019t Work", "authors": ["Justin Davidson"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/23/23-rikers-island-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
