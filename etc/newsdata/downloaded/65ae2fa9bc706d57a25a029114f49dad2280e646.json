Elizabeth Warren, from the presidential campaign trail, has doubled down on her claim that she was fired from her first teaching job because she was visibly pregnant.\n\nThe takeaway from that sentence is the phrase \u201cdoubled down.\u201d\n\nWhenever a candidate for political office has to double down on something, it\u2019s a clear sign there\u2019s doubt in the air.\n\nThere are question marks to address.\n\nThere are \u2014 dare say \u2014 accusations of lying to confront.\n\nAnd for Warren, who\u2019s already been busily scrubbing the stain of Pocohontas from her polyester stretch leisure outfits, the last thing she needs is another question mark about her truth-telling.\n\nHer trail of untruths stretches long.\n\n\u201cThe Massachusetts Republican Party has sent out a scathing mailer accusing Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren of \u201825 years of deception and cover-ups\u2019 over the use of her Native American heritage,\u201d MassLive.com wrote way back in October of 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Elizabeth Warren to apologize for her Native American deception,\u201d Legal Insurrection wrote in November of 2017.\n\n\u201cNew evidence has emerged Elizabeth Warren claimed American Indian heritage in 1986 [when she] identified as \u2018American Indian\u2019 on a registration card for the State Bar of Texas,\u201d Vox reported in February.\n\n\u201cConservatives in Hollywood Blast Elizabeth Warren for Her Native-American Deception,\u201d Lifezette wrote, also in February.\n\nSensing a theme?\n\nShortly after, the headlines changed to this: \u201cElizabeth Warren apologizes for calling herself Native American,\u201d as The Washington Post wrote, in February.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren apologizes to Native American audience,\u201d as CNN wrote, in August.\n\nAnd then the ultimate political concession \u2014 the carrot.\n\nThe dangling \u201cvote for me\u201d beg.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren Offers a Policy Agenda for Native Americans,\u201d The New York Times wrote, in August.\n\nNow comes another question mark for Warren to address?\n\nFrom Fox: \u201cSeveral times on the campaign trail, Warren suggested that she was effectively fired from a school where she taught children with special needs because she was \u2018visibly pregnant.\u2019 However, in a 2007 interview, Warren appeared to have left on her own accord.\u201d\n\nBy her own statements, in 2007, Warren said that she worked with children with disabilities in a public school \u2014 \u201cand then that summer, I actually didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u2018emergency certificate,\u2019 it was called.\u201d\n\nWarren continued: \u201cI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me. I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple years, and I was really casting about thinking, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nBy those words, it sounds as if Warren didn\u2019t have the proper credentials to continue the teaching job, went back to school to get them, had a \u201cthanks, but no thanks moment,\u201d and decided to pursue something else \u2014 since she was pregnant anyway.\n\nBut to CBS, earlier this week, Warren doubled down on her campaign remarks that she had been effectively fired from her teaching position for the crime of being pregnant.\n\n\u201cAll I know is I was 22 years old, I was six months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else,\u201d she said, on CBS. \u201cThe principal said they were going to hire someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nOh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.\n\nEmployers tell job applicants all the time that they\u2019ve selected someone else for the position.\n\nThat\u2019s hardly one and the same as being unfairly fired.\n\nAnd no matter how Warren\u2019s campaign might spin it \u2014 and spin they have, offering up the lame remark that Warren has learned to \u201copen up\u201d since becoming a public figure \u2014 fact is, this candidate, this senator from Massachusetts, has a problem with truth-telling.\n\nIt\u2019s one that\u2019s plagued her for years.\n\nIt\u2019s one that continues to plague her.\n\nAnd it\u2019s one that voters ought to wonder \u2014 rightly so \u2014 if it\u2019s a permanent facet of her character and moral compass.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
