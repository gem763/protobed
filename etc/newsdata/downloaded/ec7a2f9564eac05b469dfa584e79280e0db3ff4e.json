While actresses are reliving her story on theater stages \u2014 including one version coming to Broadway next month \u2014 she is enjoying lounging on a couch fit for a queen, wearing her red-bottom flats and singing and dancing in the seat next to her husband. She\u2019s been retired for 10 years.\n\nTurner spoke with the New York Times about her life in retirement, and the career that made her who she is. Here are a few tips to live out your retirement similar to hers.\n\nSee: How to move like Mick Jagger \u2014 in retirement\n\nOwning a home isn\u2019t mandatory in retirement\n\nTina Turner rents her mansion, which she calls the \u201cChateau Algonquin.\u201d Her landlord lives in the attic and controls the boathouse, where she does not have access.\n\nHome ownership can be a controversial topic in retirement. Some argue home ownership is a must, as it is equity retirees can tap into in the event of an emergency (either by a home equity line of credit, reverse mortgage or selling the home). But others say owning and maintaining a home can be expensive, especially for someone on a fixed income. Retirees may also find the homebuying process in retirement to be stressful.\n\nBut you should appreciate your possessions\n\nTurner doesn\u2019t keep any of her possessions in storage. She keeps a set of castle keys, pictures and paintings and knickknacks from her travels all on display. \u201cI want to see it\u201d she said.\n\nAs people age, their collections of their belongings typically grow as well. This can be problematic, especially when downsizing homes or trying to sift through items to avoid children having to do it after death. There are companies that even focus on decluttering, specifically for retirees.\n\nYou\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to quit\n\nBy the end of her 50th anniversary tour in 2009, Turner said she was more interested in home decorating than performing on stage. \u201cI was just tired of singing and making everybody happy,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019d ever done in my life.\u201d\n\nLet go of expectations\n\nWhen she was still in the spotlight, many people \u2014 including friends like Oprah \u2014 expected her to talk about her abusive relationship with former husband Ike Turner, a musician she shared the stage with in the \u201860s and \u201870s. But in retirement, she doesn\u2019t talk about him if she doesn\u2019t want to, she said. She didn\u2019t watch the Disney (DIS) 1993 biopic \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do with It,\u201d which was based on her life. And she doesn\u2019t share all of the details of the physical and emotional abuse she received. \u201cI feel I told enough,\u201d she told the Times.\n\nPeople also expect that she\u2019ll say if she\u2019s forgiven Ike, who died in 2007 from a drug overdose, for everything that happened between them. \u201cIke\u2019s dead,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have to worry about him.\u201d\n\nAlso see: How to live out your childhood dreams during retirement\n\nDo what you want\n\nThere is a plaque in front of Turner\u2019s home that says not to disturb her before noon. She has a framed painting of herself as an Egyptian queen hanging in her home, and doesn\u2019t speak German even though she lives in Switzerland, where it is one of the four main languages they speak (along with Italian, French and Romansh). But most of all, Turner only plays the role of \u201cTina Turner\u201d when she wants to. \u201cI don\u2019t sing, I don\u2019t dance, I don\u2019t dress up,\u201d she told the reporter. But the next day, she was in her wig and makeup, posing for the camera.", "description": "5 life lessons from a music legend", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR200_tinatu_ZG_20190912115713.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
