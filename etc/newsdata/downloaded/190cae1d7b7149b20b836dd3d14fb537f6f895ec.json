They move on from one beautiful young woman to the next MOST times without consequence,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018They are usually references as \u201clegends\u201d, \u201cheart throbs\u201d, \u201cG\u201d, \u201cLadies Man\u201d etc\u2026 where women are called sl*ts/wh*res!\n\n\u2018I am just trying to THRIVE/survive in a \u201cmans\u201d world\u2026if we can\u2019t beat em, join em!\n\n\u2018If our president can \u201cgrab em by the p*ssy\u2026\u201d can\u2019t I just have a kiss and acai bowl?\u2019\n\nWhen it comes to a celebrity relationship, men arguably get the better end of the stick as they move on willy nilly (pardon the pun) after a relationship, whereas the likes of Miley and, say, Taylor Swift, are slammed as harlots.\n\nSo who has moved on fairly quickly (\u2018quickly\u2019 being a subjective notion, of course) without so much as a second glance?\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nLeo is currently dating Camila Morrone (Picture: MEGA)\n\nThe actor seems pretty smitten with his girlfriend Camila Morrone now, however he has a long history of going from model to model, after he was seen with Nina Agdal not long before he was spotted with Camila.\n\nBefore that he was rumoured to have dated Rihanna, right after his split with Kelly Rohrbach. Before Kelly came Toni Garrn, Erin Heatheron and Blake Lively.\n\nNo hate to the guy, but when his romantic conquests are the punchlines of fancy awards shows, there is a double standard in how we treat relationship timelines.\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot long after The Weeknd split with Bella Hadid he moved on pretty quickly with Selena Gomez (who, similarly, had recently split with Justin Bieber) in January 2017.\n\nThey dated for 10 months before they split and the singer rekindled with Bella.\n\nAll in all, people just wondered what kind of bangers he\u2019d turn out by drawing upon the two relationships, rather than blasting him as they might his female contemporaries.\n\nPete Davidson\n\nPete didn\u2019t get hate for moving on (Pictures: REX/GETTY)\n\nPete was flippin\u2019 engaged to Ariana Grande before they split and he was seen on the arm of (and playing tonsil hockey with) Kate Beckinsale just months later.\n\nBut it was Ariana who copped the hate, after she split with Mac Miller and, in the eyes of fans, started dating Pete in quick succession.\n\nOf course the sad death of Mac only served to suggest to some they needed to blame Ariana\u2019s quick \u2018rebound\u2019 for Mac\u2019s state even more so.\n\nKeeping in mind Ariana has not been seen publicly with anyone since she split with Pete and he\u2019s now had two public relationships (his latest with Margaret Qualley). But that\u2019s neither here nor there.\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nJT and Jess started dating a month after his split from Cameron (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nJustin and wife Jessica Biel may appear as the beacon of what is good and wholesome when it comes to celebrity relationships, but you might not remember he had been in a long-term relationship with Cameron Diaz the month before he started dating Jessica in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter nearly four years JT and Cameron split in December of 2006, with the singer starting to date Jessica in January 2007.\n\nNo hate, Miley wouldn\u2019t want that, but we\u2019re just saying\u2026\n\nNick Jonas\n\nSweet Nick is now married to Priyanka Chopra after a rather whirlwind engagement, but back in 2015 the singer was spotted with actress Kate Hudson in September, as they hung out at Disney World \u2013 just three months after he\u2019d split from long-term girlfriend (and subject of his songs) Olivia Culpo.\n\nThree months is a long time for some, sure, and Kate declined to confirm anything happened with Nick, but he was far from dragged by the haters for his move.\n\nLiam Hemsworth\n\nThis pair has split before (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nSpeaking of Miley, her former husband Liam deserves a mention in here after he was seen kissing Eiza Gonzales the day after news of his first split with then-fiancee Miley hit in 2013.\n\nYeah, alright, we love Liam and Miley, but perhaps Miley was referencing the double standards afforded to her former husband after he was seen snogging a new woman the week they publicly split?\n\nFair play.\n\nEwan McGregor\n\nAfter two decades, Ewan split from his wife Eve Mavrakis, which is sad all around.\n\nHowever it soon emerged he was dating his Fargo co-star Mary Elizabeth Winstead in May 2017, as he addressed the breakdown of his marriage. He didn\u2019t file for divorce from Eve until January 2018.\n\nWilmer Valderrama\n\nWilmer and Demi dated for six years (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nThat 70s Show\u2019s Wilmer Valderrama dated pop star Demi Lovato for nearly six years, at times in that so-called on/off fashion, before they announced their split in June 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess than two months later, he was spotted with actor Minka Kelly, fuelling rumours he\u2019d moved on.\n\nWhile that union didn\u2019t turn into anything, we don\u2019t recall the social media dragging of Wilmer.\n\nSpecial mention to Taylor Swift\u2026\n\nThe Swift machine has long called out the double standards of society, after receiving hate for her dating life over the years.\n\nShe\u2019s penned countless songs about it, including recent release The Man, which was cited by many a Miley fan after her weekend\u2019s statement.\n\nWhile she\u2019s been in a relationship with actor Joe Alwyn for two years now, people still seem to not be able to get over the fact Taylor had a rather robust and thriving dating life in the years that preceded it.\n\nA twenty-something living their best life? Male OR female? Ground breaking.\n\nSo let\u2019s stop with the hate, eh? Remember, Judgey-Wudgey was a bear\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
