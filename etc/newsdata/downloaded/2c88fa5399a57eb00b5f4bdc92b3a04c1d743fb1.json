The Senate has not taken it up.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said \u201cthe conversation was cordial\u201d but added that \u201cthe president made no commitments\u201d on the House bill.\n\nElsewhere, Beto O\u2019Rourke continued to beat a louder drum.\n\nI think what\u2019s truly awful is a 17-month-old baby shot in the face with an AR-15, as happened in Odessa Beto O'Rourke\n\nThe former Texas congressman and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has insisted he will lead a government buyback of assault-style weapons if he wins the White House.\n\nThat remains an outside prospect at best but O\u2019Rourke\u2019s passionate rhetoric \u2013 and frequent resort to forceful obscenity \u2013 has struck a note on the campaign trail.\n\nOn Sunday he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press criticism of his tactics \u201cjust shows you how screwed up the priorities in Washington DC are\u201d.\n\nIn early August, in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s home town, El Paso, a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart. Less than a day later, nine people were killed in Dayton, Ohio. On 31 August, seven people were killed in Odessa, Texas.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s truly awful is a 17-month-old baby shot in the face with an AR-15, as happened in Odessa,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s truly awful is 22 people killed in a Walmart the Saturday before school starts that next Monday, buying their school supplies, innocent of any crime or any threat to this country, in fact, living in one of the safest cities in America, El Paso, Texas, hunted down by their ethnicity with a weapon that was designed for use on a battlefield.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI refuse to even acknowledge the politics or the polling or the fear or the NRA, that has purchased the complicity and silence of members of Congress. And this weak response to a real tragedy in America, 40,000 gun deaths a year, we\u2019ve got to do something about it. And I\u2019m proposing that we do something about it.\u201d\n\nA buyback, he said, would not violate the second amendment and the right to bear arms, as it would be \u201csomething that we\u2019re able to do through the commerce clause \u2026 this is constitutionally sound.\u201d\n\nHe went on, in familiar fashion, to cite support from Republican AR-15 owners he said he had spoken to out on the campaign trail.\n\nIt does alarm a lot of us when we hear Beto O\u2019Rourke saying, yes, they\u2019re just going to come and take our guns Rand Paul\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s support beyond the Democratic party,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cto include Republicans and independents, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, to do the right thing\u201d.\n\nThere is not uniform support within the Democratic party. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, presidential contender Pete Buttigieg was asked if O\u2019Rourke was playing into the hands of the NRA.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, adding that polling showed the US public wants universal background checks on gun sales, red flag laws designed to take guns from individuals deemed unfit to have them, and bans on the sale of high-capacity magazines and the sale of new assault weapons.\n\n\u201cThis is a golden moment to finally do something,\u201d the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, insisted, \u201cbecause we have been arguing about this for as long as I have been alive. When even this president and even Mitch McConnell are at least pretending to be open to reforms, we know that we have a moment on our hands. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d", "description": "* Pelosi and Schumer speak to president on gun control  * Buttigieg and Paul offer criticism of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetoricNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on Sunday offered Donald Trump a rare and highly symbolic bipartisan win \u2013 if he can somehow force Republicans in the Senate to enact gun control legislation", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x8jcM723VgxrMd8D9WnXew--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/35dbe13f534a6009bb67c4b83c7f653f", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
