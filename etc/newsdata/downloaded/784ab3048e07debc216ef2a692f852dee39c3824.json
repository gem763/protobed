During a news conference on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister said it will keep its full oil supply to its customers this month and will restore its lost oil output by the end of September.

WTI crude futures settled at $59.34 a barrel, down $3.56, or 5.66%.\n\nMSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was up 0.2% on the day.\n\nOn Wall Street, stocks finished modestly higher even as investors shunned big bets ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy decision.\n\nInvestors are waiting for clues on how far U.S. monetary policy easing may go, given that Fed policymakers are deeply divided on whether more rate cuts are warranted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult for them to signal an extremely dovish tone, given they are already half divided at this point,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33.77 points, or 0.12%, to end at 27,110.59, the S&P 500 gained 7.72 points, or 0.26%, to finish at 3,005.68, and the Nasdaq Composite added 32.47 points, or 0.4%, to close at 8,186.02.\n\nWith the retreat in oil prices, shares of energy companies, which had risen hard on Monday, gave up much of their gains.\n\nEuropean shares slipped slightly, although investors sought refuge in oil stocks and defensive sectors in response to heightened volatility after the attacks in Saudi Arabia. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.05%.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields edged lower as traders bided their time before the Fed decision on rates.\n\nWhile a rate cut is seen as near-certain this week, there are deep disagreements among Fed policymakers on whether a reduction in borrowing costs now or further decreases are warranted. Investors will focus on the \u201cdot plot,\u201d a graphic which shows where policymakers expect rates to be in the future.\n\n\u201cThe dot plot will be interesting. I would expect to see a lot more dispersion between all the dots going forward especially as we know there are a lot of contrasting views at the Fed right now,\u201d said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes were last up 10/32 in price to yield 1.81%, down from 1.843% on Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 12, 2019.
