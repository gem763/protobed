REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nThe vote at its annual conference in the English seaside resort of Brighton is the latest attempt by the party to bridge its divides over Brexit, a row that has overshadowed party officials\u2019 attempt to present Labour as a government in waiting.\n\nWith Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisting that Britain will leave the EU on an Oct. 31 deadline, Labour, like the ruling Conservatives, is struggling to agree strategy on Brexit, increasing the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years.\n\nLeftist Corbyn, an instinctive critic of the EU, has been under renewed pressure from party members and even some of his top team to unequivocally back remaining in the EU and their rebellion forced a vote between two options on Monday.\n\nThe party will vote on whether Labour should be neutral before a new election, which is widely expected to come by the end of the year, or whether the party should declare a so-called \u201cremain\u201d stance now.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s finance policy chief, John McDonnell, backed the Labour leader\u2019s approach of trying to win an election, to renegotiate a Brexit deal and then to hold a second referendum when lawmakers can campaign for whichever side they want.\n\n\u201cWe are working together as a party to make sure that people have a choice and that people will decide,\u201d McDonnell told Sky News. \u201cThat means having another referendum in which the people will be able to decide between a sensible option in terms of \u2018leave\u2019 and making sure they also have the option of \u2018remain\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut Corbyn has been criticised over what some describe as a vague stance on Brexit, with some in his party saying the lack of clarity has driven away Labour supporters, lowering the likelihood of an election victory.\n\nAccording to a new opinion poll on Monday, more than half of voters who backed Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party at a 2017 election think it is now time for Corbyn to stand down, an opinion poll showed on Monday.\n\nSo far the Labour leader has struck a neutral stance, saying on Sunday it was more important to hold the party together by embracing its \u201cremainers\u201d and those who want to leave the bloc.\n\nAsked whether Labour would campaign to remain in the EU or to leave with a deal, Corbyn said he would hold a special conference to determine his stance after an election, pledging to be guided by his party.\n\n\u201cI am leading the party, I am proud to lead the party, I am proud of the democracy of the party and of course I will go along with whatever decision the party comes to,\u201d Corbyn said.", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party will vote to decide its Brexit strategy on Monday, with leader Jeremy Corbyn heading for a showdown with his members over whether the party should back staying in the European Union.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432864659&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0EY", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
