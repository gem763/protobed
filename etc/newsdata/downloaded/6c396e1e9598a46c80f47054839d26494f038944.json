We do no-one any favours if it is rushed and not done wisely.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that while in the case of conflicted revenue for financial advisers, grandfathering had resulted in a \u201cperverse set of outcomes\u201d, that in general the parliament should not abandon a commitment to proactive legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGrandfathering is a good thing that we should largely adhere to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a fair thing to do for people who have lawfully entered into arrangements consistent with the policies of the day.\u201d\n\nLegal challenge undeterred\n\nThe passage of the grandfathered revenue ban through the parliament has not deterred the lobbying efforts of some sections of the financial advisory industry who oppose the changes.\n\nPeter Johnston, executive director of the Association of Independently Owned Financial Professionals, intended to continue pursuing legal action for what he perceives as an unlawful expropriation of property rights by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe AIOFP, its members and the Advice community in general are determined to challenge this legislation in the High Court,\u201d Mr Johnston said.\n\n\u201cIf you cut through the political spin, grandfathered revenue actually keeps the cost of advice down for consumers.\u201d\n\nMr Johnston\u2019s association is comprised of 150 licensees representing 6,000 financial advisers. He estimates that 50 per cent of his membership is \u201csignificantly reliant\u201d on grandfathered revenue, while 25 per cent are \u201cpartially reliant\u201d and the remainder are largely unaffected by the law.\n\nHe argues that neither the royal commission nor federal parliament have conducted sufficient due diligence on the market impact of the reform, echoing criticisms that Liberal backbenchers including Bert Van Manen have made against the Australian Securities and Investments Commission during parliamentary joint committee hearings.\n\nASIC has declined multiple requests for comment on the topic of grandfathered commissions to financial advisers.", "description": "The federal parliament has passed legislation to end $2 billion in commissions paid to financial advisers as recommneded by the Hayne royal commission.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1921%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_47%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/89de4b93378a09055e0b943057a91dbb13c855df", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
