Eek!': A-Bundlely Blessed Diaries #13", "language": "en", "text": "'Almost D-day! Eek!': A-Bundlely Blessed Diaries #13\n\nFollow Chantelle Whittles's pregnancy journey as she adjusts from being a mom of one to soon being a mom of four!\n\nThirty weeks in, four weeks left! It's almost D-day! Eek! According to Nicolyn, I'm turning into a couch potato.\n\nHe's not entirely wrong though. My preggy bump is getting bigger and heavier and walking up and down is not something I enjoy doing right now.\n\nMy frequent trips to the bathroom are all the exercise I need, haha.\n\nThis week I have my 30-week scan with my gynae. These days I get more excited to see the little ones and find out about their progress.\n\nJudging by their kicks and movements, I think they're ready to have a party outside my tummy! This weekend Nicolyn's friends held a nappy party for him, and they had loads of fun.\n\nI'm of course over the moon with all the nappies and wipes we received as gifts. While Nicolyn spent some time with his boys, I was also spoiled. One of my girlfriends decided to treat me for the day.\n\nWe got our nails done and went for lunch afterwards. Although I was dead on my feet the evening, the pamper and spoils were all worth it.\n\nWorld Cup fever in our household has reached its breaking point\n\nWith the Springboks through to the semi-finals, I thought Nicolyn was going to end up in hospital while watching the Bokke play against Japan!\n\nHowever, after the match, he had a \"serious\" conversation about what this means for the next two weeks. In his mind, the Springboks will make it to the Rugby World Cup final.\n\nNaturally, he's a bit concerned that I'll go into labour before then and that it will interfere with him watching rugby (haha).\n\nHe acts strong now, but if that does end up happening, I know our three little bokkies will have their pappa wrapped around their pinkies.\n\nWe've finally decided on names\n\nOh my gosh! We've finally decided on names. It wasn't an easy task. Seeing that it took us this long to find names that we love, we've decided that the babies won't have middle names, as it will take us three more months to decide.\n\nDon't worry, we'll share their names as soon as we feel ready. Now that load-shedding is back in our lives, I was a little bit freaked out about how we're going to cope with three tiny babies and no electricity.\n\nWhen Nikolai was born, we also experienced load-shedding, and I used a flask to ensure that there was hot water for his bottles.\n\nI jokingly told Nicolyn that this time around, we need to invest in an urn for the triplets.\n\nFreaking out over load-shedding\n\nWhile I'm freaking out over load-shedding, Nikolai thinks lighting candles while the electricity is off, is the coolest thing. He keeps asking whose birthday it is while blowing it out.\n\nBut the load-shedding has kind of given me more time to spend with him \u2014 just the two of us.\n\nNikolai recently mastered the card game Uno, and these days it's one of his favourite past times. I'll admit, I do let him win most of the time, while Nicolyn is stricter on the rules.\n\nBut I know he lets Nikolai win, secretly of course. We even have a floating Uno trophy in the house, which currently belongs to Uno master Nikolai.\n\nBut that's it for this week. Here's to taking it easy for the next four weeks!\n\nUntil next time!\n\nA-Bundlely Blessed and me.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
