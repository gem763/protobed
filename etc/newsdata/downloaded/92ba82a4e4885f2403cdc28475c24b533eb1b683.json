Marijuana advocates are divided among themselves over whether to push for full legalization or settle for less far-reaching legislation. And many Republicans \u2014 some of whom are seeing the benefits of cannabis legalization in their home states \u2014 are still decidedly against any legalization on the national level, even for medicinal uses.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAt the same time that Congress is in gridlock, there is growing national support for cannabis, which is illegal at the federal level but at least partially legal in 33 states. In addition, public opinion is shifting rapidly, with nearly two-thirds of Americans supporting legalization according to Gallup \u2014 double the level of support two decades ago. That\u2019s led to a steadily growing number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who represent states with legal cannabis markets, making them more sympathetic toward legislation aimed at helping the burgeoning industry \u2014 which brought in roughly $10 billion in sales last year.\n\nThese conflicts between state and federal law have created a rash of problems for cannabis companies, including lack of access to banking services, sky-high federal tax rates and bewildering questions about exactly what business practices are legal.\n\n\u201cMore and more members are hearing from their constituents about the need to get the federal government out of the way,\u201d said former House Speaker John Boehner, who joined the board of cannabis company Acreage Holdings last year, despite opposing legalization while in Congress.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of Democrats who were already there. But many Republicans are starting to come on board, as they see this dichotomy between what's going on in their own states and how the federal government continues to stand in the way.\u201d\n\nNone of that has translated into bills getting to the finish line.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country.

Supporters of the legislation, which include the influential American Bankers Association, were predicting floor passage before the August break.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen.\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), the chief sponsor of the banking bill, said he hopes it will come up for a vote on the House floor in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cI'm going to do everything I can to be a noisy member of Congress to get myself onto the calendar,\u201d Perlmutter said, acknowledging that appropriations bills will likely take precedent with the end of the fiscal year rapidly approaching. \u201cI'm going to be the squeaky wheel.\u201d\n\nShortly before the August recess, however, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) introduced much more far-reaching legislation. The MORE Act would end federal prohibition, expunge past marijuana convictions and establish grant programs designed to make sure members of minority communities are able to share in the potential financial benefits of legal markets.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t especially like incrementalism,\u201d said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a co-sponsor of the MORE Act. \u201cYou know you gotta do this in a big way.\u201d\n\nLee is also the first African American and the first woman to co-chair the Congressional Cannabis Caucus. She said Congress is at the point where a basic bill that would lift the federal ban on marijuana doesn\u2019t cut it; any comprehensive marijuana legislation introduced now needs to include social equity and criminal justice reform \u2014 like the MORE Act.\n\nThe comprehensive bill has become the top priority for many advocates, much to the consternation of some lobbyists and other staffers on the Hill who know the bill stands little chance of being enacted anytime soon, in large part because there\u2019s no way the Senate is going to entertain such a dramatic liberalization of federal drug policy.\n\nConflicts between state and federal law have created a rash of problems for cannabis companies. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere is a sense that [MORE] is going to be the bill to make it to the floor and be the first marijuana bill out of the gate,\u201d said Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group that supports overhauling the country\u2019s drug laws. \u201cThe banking bill won\u2019t go until after the MORE Act.\u201d\n\nThe reason for that, advocates say, is a desire for the first piece of cannabis legislation to encompass social equity and criminal justice reform. Some see the SAFE Banking Act as an industry bill that doesn\u2019t address equity. Others, though, like Amber Littlejohn of the Minority Cannabis Business Association, disagree with that assessment.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to create an equitable industry even two or three years from now, we need to be able to [address the] No. 1 hurdle to equity, which is access to capital,\u201d Littlejohn said. \u201cWe can have the best-designed state equity program, but if there is no funding, it will fall flat.\u201d\n\nLittlejohn argues that as long as cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, there will always be incentives for advocates and lawmakers to pass more cannabis legislation in the future \u2014 including something like the MORE Act \u2014 even if SAFE passes now.\n\nLee said the SAFE Act, while not comprehensive legislation, is important for minority business owners already in this industry, and should be seen as a great first step that does not slow down momentum for comprehensive legislation such as the MORE Act. For advocates like Littlejohn and lawmakers like Lee, the SAFE and MORE Acts are a \u201cyes, and\u201d situation, rather than an \u201ceither/or.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we have people who've been affected by the terrible war on drugs first in line to be able to apply for licenses and develop their own businesses,\u201d said Lee \u2014 referring to the equity programs in the works or recently established in many states. But recipients of priority status or equity program licenses, she said, \u201ccan't do that unless they have the capital and the access to banking services.\u201d\n\nBut even if House Democrats can overcome their internal differences and pass a bill \u2014 whether banking legislation or something more ambitious \u2014 it will face a treacherous path in the Senate. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown zero interest in doing anything to make it easier for marijuana companies to do business.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one wild card that could alter that dynamic: the electoral fate of Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who is arguably the No. 1 target of Democrats in 2020. Gardner has become a leading advocate for cannabis legislation, reflecting the booming industry in his home state.\n\nIn particular, Gardner has championed the STATES Act, which would essentially allow state-legal markets to continue operating without fear of federal punishment. That legislation hasn\u2019t gained any traction during the current Congress, despite a huge push from industry groups.\n\nIf it\u2019s perceived that Gardner needs a win in this area, it could soften McConnell\u2019s resolve, lobbyists argue.\n\nBut longtime Senate watchers are extremely skeptical that McConnell will allow any cannabis legislation to come to the floor on its own. That means the only likely possibility is attaching cannabis legislation \u2014 whether the STATES Act, banking legislation or another proposal \u2014 to some must-pass package.\n\nSaid one veteran lobbyist who works on cannabis issues: \u201cI would be shocked if Sen. McConnell wanted to spend a single second of floor time on weed.\u201d", "description": "Two-thirds of Americans support legalization, but legislation seems to be going nowhere fast on Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["Paul Demko", "Natalie Fertig"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c6/eb/ffdee5814c48b9e9f17ccd3eacb1/190908-ed-perlmutter-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
