Red squirrels are such lovely creatures.\n\n'I'm very lucky to have them visit me daily.'\n\nFormby is famous for its red squirrel population in part thanks to the National Trust sanctuary, based close to Terry's home.\n\nTerry started the challenge by placing hazelnuts in an old plant pot at the bottom of his garden.\n\nEvery few days, he would move it closer to his house so the squirrels wouldn't notice the change.\n\nThen, when they were close enough, Terry set up his homemade wooden climbing frame with food placed far apart so that the squirrels would have to leap to reach it.\n\nTerry even got to know his two furry friends well enough to give them names based on their personalities.\n\nTerry painstakingly positioned the handmade four-foot wooden climbing frame (pictured) in his back garden, topped with hazelnuts, in his pursuit of the perfect red squirrel photo\n\nTerry Donnelly spent hours in his conservatory over a year attempting to capture the perfect shot.
