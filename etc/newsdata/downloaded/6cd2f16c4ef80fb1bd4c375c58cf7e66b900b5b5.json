Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who\u2019s noncommittal about further interest rate cuts, is facing new pressure to make a third-straight reduction in response to weakening data, volatile markets and a continued bashing from President Donald Trump.\n\nMarkets placed about a 75% chance of a quarter-point rate reduction at the Oct. 29-30 meeting, up from 40% on Monday, after manufacturing and employment figures slumped this week. U.S. stocks tumbled to the lowest since August as fears of a recession increased.\n\n\u201cThe flow of the data has increased the case for a rate cut in October notably and markets are pricing it in that way,\u201d said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. \u201cIf the data continue to come in weak, that could get moderates and hawks to come on board to provide some sort of buffer for the economy.\u201d\n\nChicago Federal Reserve chief Charles Evans said Thursday the latest data haven\u2019t yet convinced him to cut rates again. In a Bloomberg interview in Madrid, the often dovish policy maker said he\u2019s open minded about the decision.\n\nPowell told reporters after the central bank\u2019s meeting Sept. 18 that the Federal Open Market Committee would decide rates \u201cmeeting-by-meeting,\u201d and further cuts would depend on incoming reports. At that time, just seven of 17 policy makers projected any more cuts this year. Powell described the reduction as insurance against a 10-year-old expansion falling into recession.\n\nBut the outlook has somewhat darkened since then, and particularly this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, a key factory index fell to a 10-year low as businesses hold back investments amid tariffs and the U.S.-China trade war. And the ADP Research Institute on Wednesday showed hiring at U.S. companies cooling. Quarterly sales reports from General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. also added to concern, sending those stocks lower.\n\nThe two-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 1.48% Wednesday from 1.55%, reflecting expectations of lower Fed interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield fell for a fifth straight day as it pushed below 1.6%.\n\n\u201cThe tightening in financial conditions the past few days is putting more pressure on the Fed to ease again,\u201d said Sarah House, senior economist with Wells Fargo & Co.\n\nTrump again blamed Powell after the manufacturing data showed declines even though economists attribute the slowdown in large part to the trade wars. The president tweeted Tuesday that the \u201cpathetic\u201d Fed has kept rates too high, leading to a rising dollar that hurts American manufacturers. \u201cThey are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\n\u201cBloomberg Economics\u2019 new U.S. recession probability indicator is flashing a warning sign and shows the chance of a downturn within the next 12 months is approximately 25%. Taking into account headwinds tied to trade uncertainty and global slowing, we expect consumer sector resilience and additional Federal Reserve accommodation to support growth.\u201d-- Tom Orlik, chief economist\n\nWhile Fed officials say they are not moved by criticism from the president or other officials, they are attuned to changes in the data.\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams said the outlook was for \u201cslower U.S. growth,\u201d which he attributed to \u201cthe effects of the trade tensions and other geopolitical tensions.\u201d Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said he\u2019s watching to see if weak confidence in the outlook \u201cwhich we know has hit businesses now is starting to hit consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFed officials for the most part are trying to communicate that they want to be in a wait-and-see mode, but markets aren\u2019t interested in that message,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont\u2019s chief economist. \u201cRemains to be seen whether Fed officialswill change their tunes. \u201d\n\nWhile this week\u2019s reports have disappointed, most recent data outside of manufacturing have been mixed and growth during the third quarter is tracking about 1.8%, according to the Atlanta Fed\u2019s estimate. On Friday, the Labor Department will report payrolls and the unemployment rate for September, which could be key to the Fed in evaluating the outlook, said Northern Trust economist Carl Tannenbaum.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
