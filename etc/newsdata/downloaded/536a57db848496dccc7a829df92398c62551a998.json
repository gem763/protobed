Bitmain claims that the new ASICs feature improvements to power efficiency and hashrate. The post states that the new hardware is capable of performing tens of trillions of hashes per second (TH/s):\n\n\u201cThe Antminer S17+ has a hash rate of 73 TH/s and operates with a power efficiency of 40 J/TH + 10%, while the T17+ offers a hash rate of 64 TH/s and a power efficiency of 50 J/TH + 10%.\u201d\n\nThe announcement also mentions the dual tube heat dissipation technology featured in the new machines and claims that \u201cthe space between the air inlet to the air outlet has been reduced by 50%\u201d which, in turn, improves both heat dissipation and fan noise.\n\nThe introduction of ASIC miners changed the face of cryptocurrency mining, which previously relied on graphics processing units (GPUs) to solve the cryptographic puzzles in mining cryptocurrencies.\n\nASICs are custom-built to a specific algorithm and can far outperform even the most powerful GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies, although some cryptocurrencies are ASIC-resistant.\n\nA global network for miners\n\nIn September, Binance announced a platform for connecting global crypto miners with farm owners. The World Digital Mining Map, which is also slated to launch during the WDMS, will purportedly connect mining hardware owners with mining farms who will provide the available power resources to host them for a fee.", "description": "Jihan Wu, co-founder of leading ASIC miner producer Bitmain, announced two new series 17 Bitcoin mining machines", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjk0NzA3ZDQ5OTE2NGRiNWE2YWYzMDZjYzI3MWFkN2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
