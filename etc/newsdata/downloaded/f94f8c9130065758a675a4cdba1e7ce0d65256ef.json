Eric Simons, who\u2019s done the bulk of his recent coaching in the IPL, explains why a test series in India is so tough.\n\nWhat makes playing tests in India so difficult?\n\nIt\u2019s a number of things. First of all, you\u2019re playing in front of a very passionate crowd and it can be quite intimidating. The heat will affect you \u2013 it\u2019s a very different heat to South Africa\u2019s. You lose a lot of fluids, so you have to stay hydrated, but it is draining, so that also plays a role. Second, the Indian team is also particularly good in its own conditions \u2013 they are masters of their own conditions. Then there are the conditions themselves, where the wickets are very different from what we\u2019re used to.\n\nIt\u2019s relentless, particularly when you\u2019re batting. You always feel like you\u2019re under pressure; you don\u2019t always get into those positions where you feel like you can control the run flows as you might on day two or three at the Wanderers or in Durban.\n\nWith this test series forming part of the World Test Championship, can India afford to get away with the atrocious pitches they prepared last time the Proteas toured there?\n\nI don\u2019t think they will \u2013 for a few reasons. Number one, the venues are not traditional test venues, so they\u2019ll want to make sure they have a good test match and not too many problems.\n\nBut the most important reason is that I don\u2019t think India need to do it.\n\nI\u2019ve read that [Jasprit] Bumrah is injured and out of the series, but they\u2019ve got a very good seam attack and they\u2019re not just restricted to relying on their spinners like they were years ago.\n\nI know he didn\u2019t make runs the last time around, but what do you think the Amla effect will be on the batting line-up?\n\nI think it\u2019s across the board. We have a top order that, if you look at [captain] Faf du Plessis, Temba Bavuma and Aiden Markram, has been around for a while.\n\nBut their record in India won\u2019t strike fear into the Indian team. While Amla didn\u2019t score runs last time, he was the elder statesman or the big brother who gave some comfort to the other guys. And I think the guys will feel a little more isolated without him.\n\nThey are going to have to pull together as a unit more than ever before.\n\nHow much of an effect do you expect batting consultant Amol Muzumdar to have?\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting one because my past 10 years in coaching have been in tournaments such as the IPL. One of the biggest jobs is not imparting your knowledge, it\u2019s getting to understand the players \u2013 and that takes time.\n\nIt\u2019s a relationship thing and, hopefully, he\u2019s taken some time to understand South Africans because we do think and work differently.\n\nIndians tend to be very technical about the way they go about things. I don\u2019t think South Africans are necessarily technical.\n\nOne of the most important things in that situation is to get to know who you\u2019re working with rather than imparting knowledge.\n\nAll things considered, that is, the Proteas are rebuilding and India are at home, what\u2019s the best result we can expect?\n\nI think that the conditions had a lot of influence in the result last time around. We\u2019re not going to have the same conditions.\n\nIt would be an incredible result if we came away with a win, but if we came away with a series draw, I think it would be a credible result.", "description": "Having lost 3-0 the last time they played India in tests in that country, the Proteas on Wednesday begin their three-test series \u2013 which also forms part of the World Test Championship \u2013 against the hosts in Visakhapatnam.", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9284/b311fa3d56c642c28486c4ba0596041e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
