The original deed was written in Nahuatl, the dominant pre-colonial language of the region and, for a period in the 16th century, belonged to one of the captains of the infamous conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. For much of its existence it was a working hacienda, growing primarily sugarcane and maize, according to Ms. Skipsey.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century it hosted an art school\u2014 the School of Outdoor Painting\u2014founded by Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez, an early proponent of the Mexican muralism movement. The school inspired artists like Frida Kahlo and her muralist husband Diego Rivera, alongside notable alumni such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Mardonio Maga\u00f1a. A painting of the hacienda, dating from this period, is in the collection of Mexico City\u2019s Palacio de Bellas Artes.\n\nMore: Resort Living in the U.S. and Mexico Comes Down to One Thing: More\n\nIt was completely restored in the early 1980s by its current owner, Elvia Gonzalez Valdes and her husband, Roger Alberto Martinez Peniche, and is currently used as both a residence\u2014the upper floor is private\u2014and for events and weddings and as a film location. It currently has a license to operate as a restaurant, subject to renewal under a new owner, and could be converted into a small boutique hotel, Ms. Skipsey said.\n\n\"Whoever buys the hacienda will be the keeper of this historic place,\" she added. \"The value is in the history, the way it has been kept. Very few have been kept in this state and used as private residences.\n\n\"It has to be for someone who understands history, loves history and loves Coyoacan. Every corner of the property has something to say, moments to describe,\" she said.\n\nStats\n\nThe hacienda is a 22,290-square-foot property, which sits on .8 acres of grounds. On the upper floor are four bedrooms, each with its private bathroom\u2014the master suite also boasts a Jacuzzi. There are six full bathrooms and three half-baths in total.\n\nFrom Penta: Cuban Art Has Its Moment in the Spotlight\n\nAmenities\n\nThe property features a game room with a billiard table, which leads out directly to the grounds. The spacious, traditional Mexican-style kitchen features an antique tile mosaic of the patron saint of chefs, San Pascual Bailon.\n\nThe hacienda also features an internal patio, complete with a 200-year-old tree, and a wine cellar, which has been converted to a pantry. On the grounds is a small chapel, which is still used as a place of worship and for weddings. There are separate staff quarters, with three rooms, and a functioning water well dating from colonial times.\n\nThe property features murals from the students of the school and imported furniture, including a Venetian rococo dining table and magnificent chandeliers. They came from Europe, transported across the Atlantic to Merida by boat, before being brought overland to Coyoacan.\n\n\"Every piece of furniture is art,\" Ms. Skipsey said. It will be sold separately but made available for a new owner.\n\nMore: Former New York Yankees Star Jason Giambi Puts Cabo Estate Up for Auction\n\nNeighborhood Notes\n\nWhen the hacienda was built, Coyoacan wasn\u2019t part of Mexico City, but as the conurbation grew, the delightful, sleepy suburb was enveloped. The neighborhood still retains much of its charm, and life is centered around its famous plaza, which contains a fountain with the figures of two coyotes, a nod to its name, from the Nahuatl language, that is thought to mean the \"place of coyotes.\"\n\nThe property is a short stroll through leafy streets to one of Mexico City\u2019s most famous attractions, the Casa Azul (Blue House)\u2014once the home of Kahlo and Rivera. It is now a remarkably well-preserved museum dedicated to the country\u2019s most famous artist couple.\n\nGonzalez Valdes, who has resided in the property for almost 40 years, said that the hacienda has earned its place in the storied area. Its \"history means it\u2019s part of this cultural neighborhood,\" she said.\n\nNear the Casa Azul is the Trotsky museum\u2014the Soviet dissident had been a houseguest of Kahlo and Rivera after he was exiled and later set up his own residence nearby. He lived there until his death, when he was assassinated in the home.\n\nAlso a stone\u2019s throw from the hacienda is the Church of San Juan Bautista, as well as the Mercado Xicotencatl, one of the city\u2019s best markets\u2014it\u2019s packed with fresh fruits, meat and vegetables, street food and artisanal crafts.\n\n*Prices are often given in U.S. dollars rather than the fluctuating Mexican peso.\n\nListing agent: Laura de la Torre Skipsey, Mexico Sotheby's International Realty\n\nView the original listing.
