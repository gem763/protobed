We award points for availability of housing (many colleges do not guarantee rooms for undergraduates throughout their studies) and for the cost. But what is the accommodation at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge actually like? Thais Warren describes three years of views over the river Cam at St John\u2019s, Cambridge (which comes second in our table for accommodation).\n\nFor the past three years at St John\u2019s, Cambridge, I\u2019ve had a view from my window onto the River Cam. My first year view was through a floor-to-ceiling wall of glass in the brutalist building reserved for all newcomers.\n\nThe second year view was from a tucked away off-site house (only two minutes from college) covered in ivy and framed by wooden beams. In the third year, I found myself with a few from the oldest part of college, through a huge round window looking down at the Bridge of Sighs.\n\nThis may sound like a Cambridge cliche, but where you live matters. St John\u2019s comes high in the Telegraph\u2019s league table because rooms are relatively affordable, they\u2019re very large, and predominantly on-site. Scattered from one end of the college to the other, they are, most importantly, available to students until the end of the summer term, with none of the tedium of moving in and out at the end and start of each holiday, or paying extra to stay even a night past the end of term. My friends from other colleges leave their clothes, books and record players in my room over the holidays.\n\nAt St John\u2019s, you\u2019ll find Hogwarts-style turreted rooms with an adjoining living room and private kitchen and bathroom, in a modern hotel-like penthouse suite with access to the roof looking over the back of the college. Who knows when I\u2019ll be able to live in such pretty surroundings again.", "description": "The Telegraph\u2019s Oxbridge College league table ranks each Oxford and Cambridge college on its accommodation.", "authors": ["James Millar"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211747045-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
