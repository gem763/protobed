I suppose it\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to speak to Real about and it\u2019s between me and them... we\u2019ll have to come to some sort of conclusion.\u201d", "description": "The Welshman was omitted from the squad for last week's Champions League clash with Club Brugge", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536249.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Real-Madrid-v-Granada-La-Liga-Santander.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
