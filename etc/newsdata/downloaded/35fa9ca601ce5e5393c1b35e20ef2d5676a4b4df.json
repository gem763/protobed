He received a cortisone shot sometime during the day, which is supposed to take 48 hours to fully settle in and alleviate the pain.\n\n\u201cAs we all know Max, he\u2019s probably going to try to push it up a little bit,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut we want him to let the medication kick in a little bit and then see where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nWith Game 6 of the World Series being do-or-die for the Nationals, who are now down 3-2 to the Houston Astros, Stephen Strasburg will start even if Scherzer were to wake up Tuesday feeling 100% healthy again.\n\nScherzer\u2019s progression over the rest of Monday and Tuesday morning could have far-reaching impacts on how Martinez uses his pitchers in Game 6. If Scherzer seems on track to start a hypothetical Game 7, will Martinez save one of his other starters, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez or Patrick Corbin, for Wednesday to relieve Scherzer in an emergency?\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Martinez will need S\u00e1nchez or Corbin to follow Strasburg in Game 6 and pitch for an inning if the game is close, especially after reliever Daniel Hudson spent himself Sunday by throwing 36 pitches.\n\n\u201cRight now my focus is on Game 6,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to treat that as Game 7 right now. There won\u2019t be Game 7 if we can\u2019t get out of Game 6.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
