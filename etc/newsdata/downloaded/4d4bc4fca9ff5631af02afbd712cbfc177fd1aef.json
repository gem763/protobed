It\u2019s not eternal. It\u2019s not going to be forever,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis\u2019 comments to The Atlantic marked the second time this week the former Pentagon chief has hinted at the broader policy disputes with Trump that precipitated his resignation in December 2018.\n\nIn an essay published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal adapted from his forthcoming book, cautioned against the \u201cinternal divisiveness\u201d and \u201ctribalism\u201d overtaking American politics.\n\n\u201cUnlike in the past, where we were unified and drew in allies, currently our own commons seems to be breaking apart,\u201d Mattis wrote.", "description": "\u2018If you leave an administration, you owe some silence,\u2019 former secretary of defense says.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1058562984-1200x628.jpg"}
