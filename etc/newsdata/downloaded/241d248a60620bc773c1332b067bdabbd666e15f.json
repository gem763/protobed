Bird droppings at the base of a solar panel. A coroner could use these signs to establish the cause of mass bird death. And a novelist could pen a murder mystery titled: Death by Renewable Energy.\n\nIn 1969, there were far more active coal plants in America than today. However, in 1969, there were also 2.9 billion more birds in America. In the last decade alone, 289 coal plants have closed\u2014a 40 percent reduction. Meanwhile, wind turbines and solar panels are going up at a record pace and scientists are reporting a \u201cfull-blown crisis\u201d in the disappearance of 29 percent of North American birds.\n\n\u201cCats eat more birds than wind turbines kill!\u201d claim wind and solar activists. But there are fewer cats in the United States today than in 2013. Meanwhile, wind turbines and solar panels are going up at an alarming rate.\n\nWhy is nearly a third of our bird population disappearing? Common birds including sparrows, robins, warblers, blackbirds and starlings play an integral role in pollinating flowers, regenerating forests by spreading seeds, and controlling pests. We may take birds for granted\u2014but we rely on them for a healthy ecosystem.\n\n\u201cHabitat loss\u201d is the top reason for this bird disappearing act according to a new analysis in the journal Science. Let\u2019s connect the dots. Coal plants are shuttering. Wind and solar farms consume vast tracts of land. The bright blades and lights in turbines and solar panels actually attract birds\u2014and the insects they eat. Therefore, Audubon reports, even if wind turbines are retrofitted: \u201cevery species of bird approaches a turbine in a different manner, so training blades to recognize all birds could take years of research.\u201d\n\nFive years ago\u2014in 2014\u2014Yahoo! News reported that wind turbines are responsible for killing over 573,000 birds annually. Bird scientist Shawn Smallwood testified that one large solar farm alone\u2014the Ivanpah solar panel project in California\u2014likely kills 28,380 birds annually. Meanwhile, we\u2019ve built more wind turbines and solar farms. Scientists claim to be \u201cstunned\u201d that birds are dropping in droves. But the writing, or bird guts, has been on the turbine blade for years.\n\nDemocrat Billionaires Get Richer Off Solar, Poor Pay Higher Energy Prices\n\nPresident Trump is the only American billionaire in recent memory (other than the late Steve Jobs) who understands that socialism destroys the economy and hurts poor people.\n\nFacebook founder billionaire Mark Zuckerberg (who once hosted a \u201cHoodie Summit\u201d for President Obama, inviting him to Facebook headquarters for a town hall in 2011 to help him get re-elected) is about to get much richer now that he\u2019s building six solar projects \u2013 each the size of four football fields \u2013 in the New Mexico desert. Fortunately for Zuck, when a Democrat destroys land, it\u2019s called \u201cmeeting energy goals.\u201d\n\nBillionaire former Google CEO Eric Schmitt endorsed Barack Obama for president in 2008. In 2013, he cashed in on his friendship with Obama to allocate a $1.6 billion stimulus loan toward Ivanpah solar thermal project along the California-Nevada border. Google was a joint owner of Ivanpah, and \u201conly\u201d destroyed 4,000 acres of pristine land and displaced a desert tortoise in the process of littering the desert with hundreds of thousands of mirrors.\n\nThe same executives jetting around the world and residing in mansions want to send the rest of us back to the caveman era. What is it to them if the rest of us lose power? They can afford to buy up 4,000 acres in the Southwest and turn it into their private solar project. Or, a crony capitalist will offer them a subsidy.\n\nAs birds die and billionaires binge, poor people pay higher prices\u2014and face energy shortages thanks to the Democrat push for \u201cclean\u201d energy. Even in the energy-rich state of Texas, there are whispers of a \u201cmandatory power cut\u201d for consumers amid triple-digit heat. Wind and solar puts a strain on the power grid because it is not very profitable or efficient. In August, Texas became \u201cthe most expensive place to buy power in all of the United States' major markets,\u201d reported Express-News.\n\nWind and solar are about 2,000 years out-of-date, and I don\u2019t normally associate antiquity with cleanliness. The Roman and Egyptian ruins are called \u201cruins\u201d because of all the dust and rubble. It\u2019s a myth that archaic technology will result in clean air and healthy ecosystems.\n\nWe will save birds\u2014and the ecosystems they nourish\u2014when we stop destroying their habitats with lethal blades and blinding panels.", "description": "Feathers at the foot of a wind turbine.
