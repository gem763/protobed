Toronto Raptors fans say LA Clippers promo is total cringe", "language": "en", "text": "Toronto fans think their past superstar\u2019s new video seems forced\n\nEarlier this summer, Raptors fans were devastated to find out that Kawhi Leonard \u2014 the Toronto Raptors MVP who brought the team to their first ever NBA finals win \u2014 had signed with the LA Clippers.\n\nSince then, fans have questioned whether Kawhi made a big mistake.\n\nSo when the Clippers released a video of Kawhi this week, Raptors fans were quick to call it out as evidence of his lack of enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a make or miss league baybeeeee!\"\n\n\n\n\u2014Kawhi \ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/AEGah79x8W \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) October 2, 2019\n\nThe promo features Kawhi using his \u201cbaybeee\u201d catchphrase, which was most notably heard in a video that Serge Ibaka took of Kawhi earlier this year.\n\nA shortened version of the video was posted to Twitter and now has more than 30 million views.\n\nBut Raptors fans are claiming that the line appears forced in the new promo.\n\nSome are even suggesting he might have just done it for the money and that it was scripted.\n\nAnd, of course, Raptors fans are claiming that life would be better for Kawhi if he\u2019d stayed with #WeTheNorth.\n\nBut is all of this criticism legitimate, or are Toronto fans just still upset that Kawhi has moved on?\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Kawhi\u2019s fans have seen him as being notoriously awkward for years now.\n\nCBC Kids News reached out to the Los Angeles Clippers to respond to the criticism that the video is inauthentic. They have yet to respond.", "description": "Toronto Raptors fans are cringing over a new Los Angeles Clippers ad featuring Kawhi Leonard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/KAWHI_thumbnail.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
