Kyodo News agency, citing its own tally, put the death toll at 69.\n\nAbe pledged to do the utmost for the safety and rescue of those missing or those who had to evacuate.\n\n\u201cWe put the people\u2019s lives first,\u201d he said.\n\nHagibis hit Japan\u2019s main island on Saturday with strong winds and historic rainfall that caused more than 200 rivers to overflow, leaving thousands of homes flooded, damaged or without power. Rescue crews on Tuesday were still searching for those missing, thought to number about 20.\n\nSome 34,000 homes were without power and 110,000 lacked running water. More than 30,000 people were still at shelters as of late Monday, according to the Cabinet Office\u2019s latest tally.\n\nBusiness appeared nearly back to normal in central Tokyo, and residents in areas where floodwater subsided started cleaning up. Lives, however, remained paralyzed in Nagano, Fukishima and other hard-hit areas that were still inundated.\n\nSome residents in Nagano returned to their homes, only to find they not be habitable.\n\nRetired carpenter Toshitaka Yoshimura, who grew up in the Tsuno district of Nagano, was stunned when he returned to his home after staying at an evacuation center during the storm. His house was a mess. Doors were knocked out, his handmade furniture was tossed around and damaged, and everything from a futon to electronics were broken and covered with mud.\n\n\u201cI put a lot of effort in this house. I made all the furniture with my wife. Now look what happened in one day,\u201d he said, with his voice trembling with emotion. \u201cNow this makes me want to cry.\u201d\n\nAt least some of his memorable photos with his family and relatives were intact, along with toys and games that his younger relatives played when they gathered at his house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they survived at least,\u201d said his nephew Kazuki Yoshimura. \u201cPerhaps we can still do something about the house, but nothing can be more precious than life.\u201d\n\nIn Fukushima, 11 bags containing possibly radioactive soil and debris removed as part of decontamination efforts from the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, were washed from two outdoor temporary storage sites and found downstream, the Environment Ministry said. Most of the remaining 5,000 bags stacked up at the two sites - one in Tamura City and another Iitate - remained in place.\n\nThere was no risk to the environment because the waterproof bags were intact and hadn\u2019t leaked, the ministry said. It said, however, officials will take preventive measures ahead of future rainstorms.\n\nA massive number of such bags are still being kept at 760 similar sites across Fukushima. Their transfer to a longer-term storage facility near the plant is expected to be completed by March 2022.\n\nSpeaking in parliament, Abe said there are concerns of lasting effects of the storm in hard-hit areas. He pledged speedy support for residents.\n\nAbe said the government is funding the disaster response from the 500-billion yen ($4.6 billion) special reserve from the fiscal 2019 budget and may compile a supplementary budget if needed.\n\nWest Japan Railway Co. said its Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train services connecting Tokyo and Kanazawa in the central north were reduced because of flooding of six trains at its railyard in Nagano. The trains sat in a pool of muddy water that was up to their windows.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the site of the railyard, which sits in an area noted on a prefectural hazard map as a flood area. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the operator\u2019s preparedness should be investigated later but the priority is to get the trains out of the water. Some water has been pumped out, but more than half of the railyard is still underwater.\n\n___\n\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo.
