Lee appeared at a Seoul courtroom on Friday for the start of a bribery trial that could result in a tougher sentence after South Korea\u2019s top court ordered a review of his graft case.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee arrives to attend a hearing at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, December 6, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\n\nLee stepped out of a van to a throng of journalists and made a brief comment but did not answer questions about the accusation he gave bribes to influence former South Korean President Park Geun-hye.\n\n\u201cI feel very sorry for causing concerns for many people,\u201d a somber Lee said, bowing his head and walking into the Seoul High Court as anti-Samsung protesters jeered.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned in August part of an appeals court bribery conviction against Samsung\u2019s de facto chief, who had been given a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for seeking favors from former president Park.\n\nThe court said the interpretation by the Seoul High Court on what constituted bribes by Samsung to Park was too narrow.\n\nLegal experts say a fresh verdict will be unlikely this year, meaning a further extension to legal troubles which have hovered over Lee and South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate for nearly three years.\n\nAs a defendant in a criminal case, Lee, 51, is required to attend the trial.\n\nThe case against Lee centered on whether three horses donated by Samsung Group should be considered bribes aimed at winning Park\u2019s favor in the conglomerate\u2019s succession planning. The horses were given to the daughter of Park\u2019s confidante, Choi Seo-won, a professional equestrian.\n\nThe Supreme Court said the appeals court erred in not recognizing the horses as bribes given by Samsung to win favors, raising the possibility of Lee returning to jail.\n\nLee, vice chairman of the group\u2019s flagship company Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS), has already served one year of detention but walked free last year after the appellate court halved a lower court\u2019s five-year jail sentence and suspended it for three years.\n\nThe trial comes as current South Korean President Moon Jae-in seeks help from big business leaders to resuscitate a fragile economy. Data on Thursday showed South Korean economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter.\n\nMoon thanked Lee for Samsung\u2019s commitment at a ceremony this month unveiling an $11 billion investment in display technologies.\n\nThe Supreme Court last week closed a separate bribery case involving Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, allowing him to stay out of jail with a suspended jail sentence.", "description": "Samsung Group heir Jay Y.
