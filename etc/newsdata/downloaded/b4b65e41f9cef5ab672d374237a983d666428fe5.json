This caused their population to steeply decline.\n\nThey are now having a \"rewilding\" resurgence across the continent, and in some parts of America, as they have been found to reduce flooding and droughts by building dams, as well as tidying willow trees next to waterways so sunlight can hit the streams and they remain clean.\n\nIn areas where beavers have been found, conservationists say, amphibian and fish populations have increased, and the water has been cleaner and healthier.\n\nIt is currently illegal to release beavers into the wild, because of the changes they can make to the environment. The issue has been hotly contested by some farmers because of the possibility of the animals causing floods to potato and carrot farms near streams.\n\nEnvironmentalists argue that this can be mitigated; in Bavaria where they have reintroduced beavers, the government relocates creatures which are causing issues for farmers.", "description": "Beavers could be reintroduced into the wild for the first time in half a century, Zac Goldsmith has suggested.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Asa Bennett", "Matt Hancock", "Liz Truss", "Sherelle Jacobs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000208420309-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
