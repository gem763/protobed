Inventories have nearly doubled since the start of the year, suggesting that supply is adequate. <MCUSTX-TOTAL>\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: The roughly 25-million tonne a year copper market should see a deficit of 320,000 tonnes this year and a surplus of 281,000 tonnes in 2020, the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) said last week.\n\nCHILE DISRUPTION: BHP said its Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, was operating at a \"reduced rate\" after union workers walked off the job for part of the day on Tuesday.\n\nThe strike was in solidarity with an anti-government protest movement across Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, that has so far had limited impact on output.\n\nALUMINIUM: The discount for cash aluminium over the three month contract on the LME fell to $2 from more than $30 in mid-September, pointing to tightening nearby supply. <MAL0-3>\n\nLME aluminium was down 0.3% at $1,748 a tonne after touching a five-week high of $1,763.50.\n\nALUMINIUM: Aluminum Corp of China, reported a 10.4% year-on-year fall in aluminium production in July-September to 950,000 tonnes and said sales fell 13.8% to 940,000 tonnes, indicating lacklustre demand in China, the top consumer.\n\nINDONESIA NICKEL: Indonesia could resume nickel ore exports in one to two weeks once an investigation into violations of export rules completes, a minister said.\n\nOTHER METALS: LME zinc was down 1% at $2,517.50 a tonne, nickel was up 0.2% at $16,860, lead was 1.6% lower at $2,229.50 and tin was up 0.1% at $16,870.
