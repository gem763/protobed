He is in good health with no obvious traumatic injuries.", "description": "Firefighters heroically rescued a two-year-old boy that had fallen into a deserted well on Tuesday in Xuzhou City in east China's Jiangsu Province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/01/17/44/1000x563_cmsv2_edc5fc98-2e5f-5e20-bd5d-02ff80d907b8-4011744.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-10"}
