Ms Wilson-Raybould was kicked out of the party for going public with her complaints over Mr Trudeau\u2019s role in the SNC-Lavalin scandal when she was Canada\u2019s attorney general. Her victory has been seen as vindication for her decision to publicly challenge the prime minister. Source: Associated Press CBC News host Michael Serapio has given his take on the individual winners and losers from this year\u2019s election, which saw a number of political heavyweights voted out of office.\n\nAdam Scotti, Mr Trudeau\u2019s photographer, has released some official images from election night. You can see them below: Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, has sent a warm (albeit quite late) message to Mr Trudeau, congratulating him on behalf of the EU. Advertisement The Globe and Mail has reported that voter turnout dipped to 66 per cent this year, down from 68.5 per cent in 2015\u2019s election. However, that figure is still higher than the turnout in 2011 and 2008, which saw the lowest voter turnout on record of 58.8 per cent. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, has released a statement on the election result.\n\nMr Ford has congratulated Mr Trudeau on his victory, despite the Canadian prime minister frequently invoking his name negatively during campaign events.\n\nHere is some post-election analysis from The Globe and Mail\u2019s Laura Stone this morning. Ms Stone says it is going to be a \"difficult few months\" for the Liberals as they try to form a stable government.\n\nWhat is the next step for Conservative leader Andrew Scheer? His party failed to topple Mr Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, despite winning the popular vote, and lost their deputy party leader, Lisa Raitt, in an unexpected defeat in Toronto. Although Mr Scheer was defiant in his concession speech, the disappointing result does put his position as leader of the Conservatives in doubt.\n\nHe will be holding a press conference at 1pm Eastern Time (6pm UK time), where we may learn more about his party\u2019s strategy for the coming months.\n\nAdvertisement Despite party leaders sounding upbeat last night, all the major parties had a mixed night in this election.\n\n- Mr Trudeau\u2019s Liberals held on to power but found themselves shut out of the province of Alberta and much of western Canada.\n\n- Andrew Scheer claimed his Conservative Party was a \u201cgovernment-in-waiting\u201d after winning the popular vote but could not convert those gains into seats.\n\n- While the NDP could be the kickmakers for a minority government, despite going backwards and losing seats.\n\nThe only party that had a clear victory was the Quebec separatist party Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, who gained 22 seats to become the third largest party in parliament. However, they are unlikely to feature in Mr Trudeau's government. Minority governments are not particularly unusual in Canada \u2013 there have been three since 2000 \u2013 but they do not tend to last much longer than two years.\n\nThat means Mr Trudeau could be facing re-election again soon. However, one senior Liberal has told Reuters that he expects Mr Trudeau to be reasonably safe for the next two years, in part because many legislators need to serve for another two years to meet the six-year requirement for a parliamentary pension. The Liberal, who requested anonymity to speak about the issue, said he believes his party will have \u201ca pretty free hand for that period\u201d. When asked about Mr Trudeau reaching out to the NDP\u2019s Jagmeet Singh to form a government soon, they said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Canada\u2019s energy industry has seen its worst-case scenario emerge with the Liberals needing the support of left-leaning parties to govern, according to Reuters.\n\nThe news agency has noted that two possible supporters of Mr Trudeau\u2019s minority government, the NDP and Green Party, have both pledged to tackle climate change at the expense of Canada\u2019s oil industry.\n\nTim Pickering, chief executive of Auspice Capital Advisers (a crude oil exchange-traded fund), said:\n\n\u201cThis truly is the worst possible outcome. We have got a Liberal minority and the balance of power shifts to the NDP and the Greens, who are completely opposed to any progressive energy policies.\u201d\n\nThe energy sector reportedly worries that the long-delayed Trans Mountain expansion project (TMX) could be under threat, as the NDP and Greens both firmly oppose the expansion.\n\nThe controversial project, which Mr Trudeau\u2019s government bought for C$4.5bn (approximately \u00a32.7bn), would triple the flow of oil sands crude to the British Columbia coast. Additional reporting by Reuters CBC News\u2019 Mike Crawley says the province of Ontario was crucial to the Liberal Party\u2019s victory in this election.\n\nHe said Mr Trudeau\u2019s party \u201cbarely sustained any damaged in Canada\u2019s biggest province\u201d, which helped the Liberals to hold on to their position as the largest party in parliament. Although the Liberals saw their vote share drop significantly in the Atlantic region and Western Canada, Mr Crawley said, their continued success in Ontario was enough to keep them in power for now.\n\nAdvertisement The Independent\u2019s Brad Hunter has a report from Toronto this morning on how Canada\u2019s \u201cprogressive prince\u201d clung on to power after a bruising election campaign. Mr Hunter has noted that Mr Trudeau\u2019s minority government could be fairly long-lasting, if only because there is no appetite for another election. He said: \u201cNeither Canadians nor their politicians are ready for another round at the voting booth, but both of the main parties emerged from the previous 40 days with a little less dignity.\u201d You can read the full piece below: Boris Johnson, the UK\u2019s prime minister, has commented on the Liberal Party\u2019s victory by congratulating Mr Trudeau and saying he is looking forward to working with Canada on supporting girls\u2019 education and climate change initiatives. Although the election result may have been underwhelming for many Canadians, the night did see one notable moment when the leaders of three major parties had their speeches at the same time in an incredibly awkward piece of scheduling.\n\nOne anchor described Mr Trudeau\u2019s decision to speak at the same time as his rival Andrew Scheer as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, with some commentators interpreting it as a show of disrespect. CBC News was left struggling to decide who to focus on\u2026\n\nThere is still no news from the last two seats to be called - although we know that the Liberal Party are expected to take both of them. If those predictions are correct, the Liberals will be 13 seats short of a majority. Source: Statista The projected final result is below: Advertisement The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has said voters should expect \u201c an unruly House of Commons divided along regional fault lines \u201d in the coming months.\n\nChris Hall, the CBC\u2019s national affairs editor, wrote: \u201cThere is no escaping the fact that this is a country divided. Trudeau couldn't ignore it even in his victory speech, which directly addressed voters in the Prairies and Quebec; Trudeau assured them he had heard their message, without suggesting how it might influence his decisions. \u201cBut it's not only a regional divide. The Liberals' support is overwhelmingly in urban centres and their suburbs. For the Liberals, winning this election was hard \u2014 but governing might turn out to be harder.\u201d The pessimistic conclusion is that \u201cFor now, common ground remains elusive\u201d, but Mr Hall has noted climate change and universal pharmacare as issues that could possibly unite a minority government. Jeremy Wildeman, a research associate for the University of Bath, has described the election result as \u201ca struggle that caught the world by surprise\u201d. Writing for the Conversation Canada , Mr Wildeman has said Canadian progressives expected Mr Trudeau to lose seats and picked out two political events that damaged his support. First, there was his government\u2019s purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline from the US-based corporation Kinder Morgan, which angered environmentalists and the First Nations communities affected by the decision. Second, there was the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which Mr Trudeau was accused of political interference with the justice system Mr Wildeman concluded: \u201cThough Trudeau\u2019s struggles may seem surprising, the inability of his government to truly address deep structural inequalities and income insecurity in Canada fits a pattern of the fracturing of the political landscape of nearly every other liberal democracy. This plagued Obama\u2019s administration as well. \u201cHaving a family name and background that symbolises privilege, in a world where wealth inequality and nepotism have become such divisive topics, hasn\u2019t helped Trudeau.\u201d Campbell Clark, the chief political writer for one of Canada\u2019s most influential papers, says the NDP are the \u201cobvious choice\u201d for Mr Trudeau\u2019s partners in government. The Globe and Mail writer said: \u201cThe NDP and Jagmeet Singh [their leader] have actually been weakened in this election\u2026 \u201cThey\u2019re not as strong, they\u2019re going to be short on money and so they will probably want to prop up a minority government for a while.\u201d However, the NDP will have some demands for supporting Mr Trudeau\u2019s government, with pharmacare \u2013 a system in which the government helps to pay for Canadians\u2019 prescription drugs \u2013 being a likely price for support. Mr Clark added that other political pressures on Mr Trudeau, such as the rise of Quebec separatists, could complicate those plans. What does the success of the Quebec separatist party Bloc Quebecois (BQ) mean for Canadian politics?\n\nUnder the leadership of Yves-Francois Blanchet, BQ has jumped from 10 seats to 32 in the predominantly French-speaking province, helping to deny Mr Trudeau a majority in parliament.\n\nHowever, they are unlikely to be kingmakers as the Liberals are expected to govern with the left-wing NDP. Mr Blanchet has succeeded in part by playing down talks of separatism and presenting BQ as a party that will represent Quebec\u2019s interests, rather than break up Canada. Pierre Martin, a professor at the University of Montreal, explained Mr Blanchet\u2019s appeal: \u201cThe strength Blanchet brings is he projects an image that is not quite as hardcore as the previous leaders. That allows him to draw on a much wider slice of the electorate.\u201d The BQ leader has said his party wants to work with parliament and will support any proposed legislation that they believe is good for Quebec.
