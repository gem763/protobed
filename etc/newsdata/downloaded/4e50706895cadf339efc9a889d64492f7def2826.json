Romney\u2019s decision to sit out the GOP primary isn\u2019t surprising given his friend and predecessor, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, is running against President Trump. But it would be extraordinary if Romney held back his endorsement when Trump is up against a Democratic nominee in the general election.\n\nRomney and Trump have had a rocky relationship, but since being elected to the Senate, Romney has largely held back on criticisms of the president, reserving them for big moments like after the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s final report.", "description": "The former GOP presidential nominee and current U.S. senator from Utah said Thursday ahead of the third Democratic debate that he\u00a0does not intend to endorse anyone in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-washpost-wordpress-uploads/primetime/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/09/10140239/2019-08-21T101235Z_207125815_RC1D971C7840_RTRMADP_5_USA-ELECTION-POLLS.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"}
