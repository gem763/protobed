Researchers assessed tens of thousands of statements, policy announcements and lobbying campaigns by the 250 biggest investor-owned industrial corporations and trade associations.\n\nQ&A What is the polluters project? Show Hide The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\nInfluenceMap used a definition of what constitutes lobbying drawn from the UN-backed Guide For Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy.\n\nThe research revealed that since 2015, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, Daimler, BMW, Toyota and General Motors have been among the strongest opponents of regulations to help countries meet the 1.5C warming limit in the Paris agreement.\n\nIn the four years since then, lobbying from the car industry in the US and Europe has attempted to block, delay and frustrate initiatives to regulate and reduce emissions from the transport sector \u2013 which is responsible for 15% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and slow the move to electric vehicles, the report says.\n\nEdward Collins, author of The Carbon Policy Footprint, said: \u201cCorporations have a profound impact on the climate change agenda not only through physical emissions but through influencing of the climate change policy agendas being introduced by governments around the world.\n\n\u201cThe sector has dug in hard to dampen rising vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards. Through their lobbying, auto companies have delayed the transition of a sector that sucks up a huge proportion of oil demand globally.\u201d\n\nOil firms to pour extra 7m barrels per day into markets, data shows Read more\n\nThe Guardian contacted all the named car companies and their responses are set out here. Most said they were committed to reducing emissions and moving their fleets to lower-emission models but the transition had to take into account other factors including market realities, customer preference, and infrastructure development.\n\nFord denied it was pushing for a rollback of emissions standards in the US. It pointed to its recent agreement with California to increase gas mileage standards and reduce emissions.\n\nInfluenceMap identified 33 corporations as the strongest opponents of action to reduce climate change. Six of them were car companies, and the rest primarily oil and gas companies as well as energy firms.\n\nThe lobbying efforts are revealed as countries increasingly set targets to phase out new sales of cars with internal combustion engines \u2013 the Netherlands and Norway by 2025, Germany, India and China by 2030, and France and the UK by 2040.\n\nThe influence exerted by the car companies is fronted and aided by industry groups including the US-based Automotive Alliance, as well as Europe\u2019s ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association) and the VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry). These groups all have senior figures from the big car companies on their boards of directors.\n\nFiat Chrysler was ranked most oppositional to climate change regulations and initiatives, Collins said. The company is a \u201ckey player\u201d in the industry\u2019s efforts to weaken US clean car standards, known as CAFE standards, set by Barack Obama, which would almost double the fuel economy of vehicles to an average of 54 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nFiat Chrysler has supported a review of the CAFE standards being considered by the president, Donald Trump. Its late CEO, Sergio Marchionne, said last year he was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the administration\u2019s efforts to revise the standards.\n\nGeneral Motors and Ford have also been key lobbyists through the industry group pushing back against the CAFE standards, while putting out the message in public that they are signed up to the transport transformation required, the report says.\n\nThe report acknowledges that Ford recently softened its stance and agreed a compromise in California, but that change of position \u2013 after a significant stretch of oppositional lobbying \u2013 only marginally impacted on its ranking, which involved analysis since the Paris agreement in 2015.\n\nThe California agreement, Collins said, still constituted \u201ca diluted set of standards\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson for Ford said: \u201cWe have said multiple times that Ford does not support a rollback of federal emission standards. Additionally, Ford supports CO 2 reductions consistent with the Paris climate accord, as we have shared publicly.\u201d\n\nThe weakening of the CAFE standards would increase US CO 2 emissions by up to 931m metric tonnes between 2022 and 2035 \u2013 a sharp rise in global heating that amounts to the annual emissions of 82% of the countries in the world in 2019, according to recent research.\n\nIn Europe, the car industry, through the ACEA and the VDA, has continually pushed against new CO 2 emissions standards for new vehicles by 2021, and from 2021 to 2030, under the EU clean mobility package.\n\nAverage emissions of cars produced by manufacturers must be 95g/km by 2021, with penalties of \u20ac95 per g/km, per car, for companies not meeting those targets.\n\nBut data from the EU environment watchdog the EEA shows that the car industry is far off the target. CO 2 emissions of new cars increased in 2018 by 1.6% to 120.4g/km.\n\nThis rise coincided with soaring sales in Europe of SUVs, which emit higher emissions. SUVs account for a third of new cars sold in Europe, an increase from 7% in 2008.\n\nCar industry lobbying in Europe through ACEA successfully shelved a proposed EU mandate on sales of electric cars by 2025 similar to those that operate in California and China.\n\nJulia Poliscanova, the clean vehicles director for the Transport & Environment NGO, said the automotive industry was seeking to eke out the last profits of the traditional engine by frustrating emissions reduction targets and questioning every aspect of electric technology, from expressing apparent concerns about the affordability for consumers to querying if the infrastructure will be in place in time.\n\n\u201cThe car industry has always maximised its profits from its existing models and products for as long as is possible to make their money and delay and work around the regulations,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey have known for years \u2013 since 2013 \u2013 the standards coming in on emissions in 2021. They have had years to prepare but they didn\u2019t. Instead they pushed their SUV market, maximised its sales reach to make profits from these high-polluting, high-margin vehicles for as long as possible and now they are scrambling to comply, claiming how difficult it is to meet the targets, but they only have themselves to blame.\u201d\n\nUnilever is ranked the most influential positive company, while Apple and Amazon are also deemed to be among the top positive corporate influencers.\n\nCollins said the majority of the world\u2019s most influential companies remained on the fence about the policies needed to address the climate crisis.\n\nWhile making PR-friendly comments on climate they do not engage in any way with the regulations being introduced by global governments to meet the Paris agreement, the report says.", "description": "Lobbying in US and Europe has tried to block and delay moves to cut emissions, study shows", "authors": ["Sandra Laville"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5d9af6ec191750464e10300ae51034cdf0dc61/0_144_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f210442fc67edf376738ed675bdef93b", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
