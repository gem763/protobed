Cory Booker said.\n\nAnd from Mayor Pete Buttigieg, tossed a softball about Trump\u2019s wall-building project \u2014 specifically, if it were racist: \u201cAnyone who supports this is supporting racism. The only people who actually buy into this president\u2019s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don\u2019t know any,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd this, from Sen. Kamala Harris, on recent mass shootings in America: \u201cObviously, [Trump] didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he certainly tweeted the ammunition,\u201d she said.\n\nHer point? That Trump\u2019s racist, and it\u2019s his racist views that have stoked racial tensions \u2014 which in turn have brought about racially-based mass shootings.\n\nAs attacks on the president go, these aren\u2019t exactly stealth.\n\nJulian Castro, for example, bought advertising time in mid-August in which he bluntly said: \u201cPresident Trump, you referred to countries as sh\u2014holes. You urged American congresswomen to \u2018go back to where they came from.\u2019 You called immigrants rapists. As we saw in El Paso, Americans were killed because you stoked the fire of racists. Innocent people were shot down because they looked different from you. Because they looked like me. Because they looked like my family. Words have consequences.\u201d\n\nCastro made the same point from the ABC News debate stage.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump,\u201d he said then, \u201chas a dark heart when it comes to immigrants.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. If Democrats are in it to win it \u2014 if Democrats truly want to have a chance at taking back the White House in 2020 \u2014 they have to focus on something that\u2019s bigger than name-calling. Particularly when the name-calling is pulled from thin air, absent factual basis.\n\n\u201cBlack unemployment rate falls to a record low,\u201d CNN wrote, just a week before the debate.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, the unemployment rate amongst African Americans hit a record low \u2026 to 5.5%, which is the lowest rate recorded since the Labor Department began tracking the progress back in the 1970s,\u201d Black Enterprise reported, a few days ago.\n\n\u201cWomen of color are surging into the U.S. workforce,\u201d The Washington Post just reported.\n\n\u201cMinorities ages 25 to 54 make up most new hires in workforce,\u201d CNBC just wrote.\n\nAnd back in July, The New York Times reported this: \u201cHispanic women have emerged as the biggest job market winners in an economy that has now grown for 121 straight months.\u201d\n\nAll that would seem to put a dent in the Democrats\u2019 ongoing accusations of racism against this president \u2014 yes? Or, another way to ask: Would a true-blue racist pol actually press policies that help minorities? Logic, people. Think about it.\n\nAll that would also seem to explain just why Democrats are so reluctant to go after this president on policy. They can\u2019t. They can\u2019t win on that. This White House, by even some of the Trump-hating media members\u2019 own admissions, has overseen a massive surge in economic good times.\n\nA massive surge that has benefitted the very voters Democrats count as their bread and butter \u2014 blacks, Hispanics, women.\n\nSo what\u2019s a poor Democrat to do? Cry racism, cry foul, and accuse this president of the most heinous of crimes, including inciting the murders of innocent American citizens.\n\nThe extreme rhetoric may make for good television news drama. But in the end, the left\u2019s cries are based on lies, and that certainly won\u2019t win Democrats the White House.\n\nIn the end, Trump\u2019s reelection team has little to fear.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
