The company's closely watched adjusted earnings per share fell to $2.68 from $3.42 in the year-prior period, ahead of the $2.66 estimated by analysts surveyed by FactSet. IBM sales fell to $18.0 billion, below analysts expectations, from $18.76 billion.\n\nThe revenue decline was IBM's fifth in a row, and its 27th overall under Ms. Rometty, who has struggled to adapt the more than century-old company to a changing global information-technology landscape.\n\nIBM shares fell around 3% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe company's earnings were dented by weak performance of its legacy business of providing IT services to other companies. Revenue for that division fell 5.6%.\n\nMs. Rometty has bet heavily that IBM's growth prospects lie in the booming cloud-computing market. Cloud revenue climbed 11% to $5.0 billion.\n\nWrite to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThis article was corrected at 5:14 p.m. ET to reflect that Ginni Rometty is IBM's CEO. The original version of this article misspelled her first name as Ginny.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 17:01 ET (21:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
