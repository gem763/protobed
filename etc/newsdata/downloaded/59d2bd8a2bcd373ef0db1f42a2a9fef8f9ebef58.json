It\u2019s like, \u2018OK, she must be destroyed.\u2019 And I did hear people say, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s going to try to humanize Trump.\u2019 At the network they said that. And it\u2019s like, what, you mean Trump voters? Is that who you\u2019re afraid is going to get humanized?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an elitist, out of touch view of humans,\u201d the comedian continued. \u201cIt\u2019s already offended me. It always offended me that they didn\u2019t like their audience, and I liked the audience because I thought I\u2019m from there and they\u2019re familiar to me. And I vowed to myself: I\u2019m not going to disrespect the audience. And I never did. And I never did sell out, neither.\u201d\n\nAsked on the podcast if she is in contact with the president, Ms. Barr responded, \u201cYeah, a little.\u201d She added that it is \u201c[expletive] exciting,\u201d calling Mr. Trump \u201clike a [expletive] Mick Jagger\u201d and \u201cbigger than the pope.\u201d\n\nMs. Barr, 66, won both an Emmy and Golden Globe, among other accolades, for \u201cRoseanne\u201d when the sitcom originally aired on ABC between 1988 through 1997. She briefly starred in a revived version of the show aired by the network in 2018 before it was canceled roughly two months later amid an uproar brought on by a Twitter post widely condemned as racist.\n\nABC canceled the rebooted \u201cRoseanne\u201d after Ms. Barr tweeted that Valerie Jarrett, a former senior presidential adviser during the Obama administration, looked like as if \u201cMuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.\u201d Ms. Barr subsequently described it as a \u201cbad joke about her politics and her looks\u201d and apologized.\n\nMessages requesting comment from ABC and the White House were not immediately answered.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
