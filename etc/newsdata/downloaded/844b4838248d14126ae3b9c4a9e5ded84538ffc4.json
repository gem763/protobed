News. \"Martin was kind when he said it's not cinema. He didn't say it's despicable, which I just say it is.\"\n\nSoon afterward, Coppola's comments were met with staunch pushback from Marvel fans online. One wrote: \"Disappointed to see the comments by Scorsese + Coppola about Marvel MCU movies. Their comments reflect those that comic book fans have dealt w/for years from people who thumb their noses at comics + refuse to consider comics can teach/be literature because its 'beneath them.'\"\n\nDisappointed to see the comments by Scorsese + Coppola about Marvel MCU movies.\n\n\n\nTheir comments reflect those that comic book fans have dealt w/for years from people who thumb their noses at comics + refuse to consider comics can teach/be literature because its \"beneath them.\" pic.twitter.com/nFBgNpL5YS \u2014 Jon D. Allred (@Jon_Allred) October 20, 2019\n\n\"Coppola's hypocrisy here - a man who lauds the achievement of his former protege George Lucas, whose Star Wars certainly gave the blue print for the modern Marvel blockbuster - is astounding,\" another wrote.\n\nYet another chimed in, writing, \"I think I'd rather watch another Marvel movie than another Francis Ford Coppola movie at this point. At least Marvel movies have characters worth celebrating. I hate [these] old men directors who think movies should all be of one tone and style.\"\n\nI think I\u2019d rather watch another Marvel movie than another Francis Ford Coppola movie at this point. At least Marvel movies have characters worth celebrating. I hate this old men directors who think movies should all be of one tone and style. \u2014 David (@the_anticitizen) October 20, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, Scorsese shared his misgivings about Marvel films like Avengers: Endgame, which became the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Avatar, just months ago.\n\n\"I don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema,\" Scorsese told Empire, via The Hollywood Reporter. \"Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\"\n\nHis comments also prompted widespread condemnation from Marvel fans, as well as MCU filmmakers like Joss Whedon, who tweeted: \"I first think of @JamesGunn, how his heart & guts are packed into GOTG. I revere Marty, & I do see his point, but\u2026 Well there's a reason why 'I'm always angry.'\" The last line is a reference to Bruce Banner's (Mark Ruffalo) famous Hulk line.\n\nHours later, Gunn responded to the criticism as well, tweeting: \"Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I'm saddened that he's now judging my films in the same way.\"\n\nSee more Marvel news below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nUpcoming Marvel Movies: The Full List From 'The Eternals' to 'Thor: Love and Thunder' and More\n\nSpider-Man No Longer Leaving the MCU as Sony and Marvel Settle Dispute\n\nNatalie Portman Talks Returning to Marvel for 'Thor: Love and Thunder' (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "The 'Godfather' director took aim at the superhero films over the weekend.", "authors": ["Scott Baumgartner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uWee4ajA2LScZxZGG37Sog--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/f7150c504ca1664e320eead38a9b0fb9", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
