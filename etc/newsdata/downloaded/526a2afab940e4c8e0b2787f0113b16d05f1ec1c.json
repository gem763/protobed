It has access to more than 3,500 locations, including national parks, recreation areas and historic sites such as the Washington Monument.\n\nTo help meet growing online demand, the Recreation.gov revamp tapped container technology, which companies use to stay agile in an increasingly software-defined world. Complex applications are broken into small pieces of code defining a certain service, placed into software shells, and distributed across devices. Using containers to cordon off services like booking can cut development costs, allow for personalization and help the reservation system run faster.\n\nThe portal, which runs on Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s Amazon Web Services cloud service, offers more than 45 services, including camping inventory, tour tickets, entry passes and hunting permits. Over the past year, the site has generated about $150 million in revenue for the government.\n\nAmong other improvements, the new system lets campers use a mobile app to reserve campsites, something that wasn\u2019t possible earlier. People who book using the portal can be alerted in real time about reservation cancellations due to forest fires, floods or government shutdowns.\n\nSunrise in Haleakala National Park in Hawaii.

The 10-year, $182 million contract began in 2017.\n\nThe effort represents a small component of the government\u2019s quest to modernize its information technology, in part by incorporating tools and practices found in the commercial sector.\n\nFederal agencies are moving aging technology into the cloud from on-premises data centers to automate processes and cut costs, said Arun Chandrasekaran, distinguished vice president and analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner Inc.\n\n\u201cI think of [the Recreation.gov revamp] as a steppingstone for them to really modernize their environment, to make it more cloud friendly, and at the same time, get some cost savings out of the underlying infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Chandrasekaran said.\n\nThe updated Recreation.gov site lets campers use a mobile app to reserve campsites.

They can sell out in a matter of minutes.\n\n\u201cThe public nowadays more than ever wants to know they have a spot when they get there. When I was young, we would just drive up and find a campsite, no big deal,\u201d said 56-year-old Rick DeLappe, program manager for Recreation.gov at the National Park Service.\n\nHow the system helps users:\n\n\u2022 The service to book campsites is prioritized to handle extra traffic during, say, the late winter and early spring, when summertime reservations for Yosemite campsites become available.\n\n\u2022 A technology that manages the containers makes sure the booking system meets demand so campers don\u2019t hit busy servers.\n\n\u2022 The containers used for the booking system are replicated in servers across different regions of the country, meaning every would-be camper gets an equal shot at a coveted camping spot.\n\n\u201cWhen everybody shows up to click the buy button at the same time, there is not a huge snowball effect on the service,\u201d said Martin Folkoff, chief technologist in Booz Allen Hamilton\u2019s strategic innovation group.\n\nSite development started in mid-2017 and the portal was deployed to Amazon Web Services in October 2018. This is the first time the portal was built for the cloud, which provides the foundation to cater to new interfaces like mobile, Mr. DeLappe said.\n\nThanks to the technology refresh, Recreation.gov has been able to release a constant stream of updates.\n\nMore than 100 sites have been added since February, among them Indiana Dunes National Park along the shores of Lake Michigan. Campsite reservations have increased about 30% from last year\u2019s figures, said Will Healy, vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nFor Olympic National Park near Seattle, the revamp cut costs. The park, which was added to Recreation.gov this year, projects it will save about 5,000 staff hours and up to $150,000 a year.\n\nWrite to Agam Shah at agam.shah@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. government has made it easier to book a camping trip by moving a travel portal to the cloud, a tech revamp that makes the website more reliable and gives it the flexibility to add services.", "authors": ["Agam Shah", "Agam.Shah Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-115682/social", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
