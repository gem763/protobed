The company is working on a wristband that will allow people to control devices based on signals from their spinal cord. Upon completion of the deal, CTRL-labs will join Facebook Reality Labs, which is working to develop augmented-reality smart glasses.\n\nZuckerberg, DeRisi and Quake were chatting as part of the Facebook CEO's series of discussions focused on the future of technology and society. Throughout the conversation, they touched on the challenges and advantages of using implanted technology to read a human's neurons. Quake said there are health risks involved with implantable technology, while DeRisi pointed out that implantables can decode real-time inner speech that could help people with limited physical or speech abilities from a stroke, for example.", "description": "Following Facebook's recent acquisition of CTRL-labs, Mark Zuckerberg is putting more thought into the future of brain-reading wearable and implantable technology.", "authors": ["Salvador Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105882878-1556646593152rtx6tte5.jpg?v=1556646632", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
