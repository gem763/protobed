Why the hell not? The media spent 36 months creating a hurricane of hysteria. Now, they rush to their fainting couches when he comes out fighting. Sorry, his reaction is real. Media outrage is not.\n\nDAVID BOSSIE: PELOSI'S IMPEACHMENT RUSH TO JUDGMENT IS TOTALLY PREMATURE BUT RABID DEMS ARE DESPERATE\n\nIf you're still looking for proof of how the media manipulates you, NewsBusters revealed that the networks devoted seven hours to the whistleblower's complaint while giving 46 minutes to Hunter Biden's sweetheart deal.\n\nTwo allegations: one treated like Watergate, the other, water under the bridge.

They hate the guy. But it's also their business model. Without division, there are no dividends.\n\nHow can you face your friends at the Hamptons if you're not demonizing Trump? Better to be cool than to be correct, country be damned.\n\nAdapted from Greg Gutfeld\u2019s monologue on \"The Five\" on Oct. 2, 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM GREG GUTFELD", "description": "How can you face your friends at the Hamptons\u00a0if you're not demonizing Trump?", "authors": ["Greg Gutfeld", "Greg Gutfeld Currently Serves As Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/02/694940094001_6091438143001_6091444071001-vs.jpg"}
