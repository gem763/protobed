ITV later confirmed it was cancelled.\n\nDymond's family applied for legal aid for the inquest on the grounds that his death requires an Article 2 inquest and that there is significant wider public interest in the inquest, given its links to a well-watched TV show and the care provided to participants in reality television generally - but their application was denied.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nMerry Varney, solicitor for the family from law firm Leigh Day, said: \u201cIt is disgraceful that Stephen\u2019s family are having to fight for legal aid in this inquest.\n\n\"As well as dealing with their grief, we believe they have been subjected to flawed decision making by the Legal Aid Agency\".\n\nThey added: \"Stephen\u2019s family strongly believe that there is a wider public interest in his inquest given the prevalence on reality television in today\u2019s society and the other reported deaths that have been linked to reality television participants.\u201d\n\nThe construction worker was found dead in his bedroom in Portsmouth on 9th May, shortly after splitting from Jane, Portsmouth Coroner's Court heard.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHampshire Police Detective Sergeant Marcus Mills told the inquest that Dymond was living in the property of a pair called Michelle and Sam, and had moved in on 10th February.\n\nHe said: \"Steven had told Michelle and Sam he had been in a relationship with a female named Jane.\n\n\"They had split up and he had been kicked out of the house following allegations he had been cheating.\n\n\"Steven had also mentioned they were going to go on the Jeremy Kyle show for a lie detector test to get everything sorted.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Steven told Michelle that things didn't go well on the show.\n\n\"He became angry when talking about Jane. He became concerned about the repercussions of the show and the rumours that had started as a result.\"\n\nDymond had recently been in touch with estranged son Carl and discovered he was a grandfather, the hearing was told.\n\nTwo letters, one addressed to Carl and the other to Ms Callaghan, were discovered near his body alongside medication packets, DS Mills said.\n\nHe added: \"There were no signs of foul play from any other parties. This was a suspected suicide.\"", "description": "Stephen Dymond's family are demanding ITV hand over all the evidence relating to his appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Steve Dymond Facebook", "Facebook", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20524564.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EMP_CHP_130519SLUG_222JKJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
