Extinction Rebellion, who plan to bring Westminster to a standstill with protests next week.\n\nThe Crown's Oscar-winning actor Olivia Colman, broadcaster, author Stephen Fry, and TV comic Alan Carr are among the stars who have backed the activists, who are planning to disrupt the heart of London from Monday.\n\nXR plan to block all roads to Westminster as well as stage a sit in at City Airport to highlight their campaign against climate change.\n\nThe actors donned 'X' badges at the Royal Albert Hall last night and were joined by comedian Asim Chaudry, and American actress Crystal Clarke.\n\nThe Crown's Oscar winner Olivia Colman (centre) poses with Stephen Fry (far left), Alan Carr (far right), comic Asim Chaudry, and US actress Crystal Clarke last night wearing XR badges\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters yesterday sprayed the Treasury building in central London with fake blood using an old fire engine in their latest stunt to raise climate change awareness\n\nChaudry and Colman's support for the protesters may land them in opposition to British Airways, who have a fleet of aircraft operating from London City Airport.\n\nThey both appear on a BA in-flight safety films with other stars such as Michael Caine, Joanna Lumley and David Walliams.\n\nProtesters plan to gather at London City Airport next week.\n\nXR activist Molly, who took the picture, said: 'We appreciate the support of everybody and it is fantastic that these actors wore the badges on stage too.\n\nChaudry and Fry were at the Royal Albert Hall for an event where they wore the ER badges\n\n'They were really keen on supporting XR and said we were brave to have a campaign of civil disobedience which is non-violent.'\n\nThe actors were at the Royal Albert Hall at the Letters Live show where performers read letters across the centuries and from around the world for charity.\n\nThe protests are set to bring disruption to the centre of the capital as part of an 'international rebellion' around the world calling for urgent action on the climate and wildlife emergencies.\n\nAhead of next week's protests, eight people were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after activists sprayed the Treasury in central London yesterday with fake blood to protest against funding for fossil fuels.\n\nThe Met Police said five men aged between 34 and 83 and three women aged between 34 and 60 were arrested and the fire engine used to spray the liquid was seized and removed.\n\nA fortnight of further action is planned with activists saying they plan to shut the streets leading to Westminster, targeting sites including Lambeth and Westminster Bridges and Trafalgar Square, each held by people from different parts of the country.\n\nColman and Carr (above) were all smiles at the Letters Live show in central London where performers read letters across the centuries and from around the world for charitable causes\n\nProtests will also be held outside government departments, calling on them to outline what their plans are to tackle the climate emergency, with protests including a farming group with a pink tractor.\n\nOther actions include processions, marches and a peaceful sit-in at City Airport where they will try to hold the space for three days.\n\nThe protesters say they have not yet decided if they will hold a silent vigil to mark a lack of action in the Queen's Speech on October 14 or to try to shut it down.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesman Joel Scott-Halkes said: 'We are going to the Government and specifically what we're going to do is sit down peacefully in the roads.\n\n'We're going to blockade and shut down every single road going into the central area of Westminster around the UK Government.\n\n'We are going to very loudly, very clearly, very respectfully say that if a government is taking its people towards extinction, it is not a government anymore that we respect.'\n\nAnother spokesman Robin Boardman, 21, said it could be five times bigger than the protests which brought major disruption to London in April and saw more than 1,100 arrests,\n\nAs many as 20,000 to 30,000 people could be involved this time, he said.\n\nWhile Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has warned of the strain policing protests will put on the force, Mr Boardman said the protests were not about the police, 'it's about putting pressure on the Government'.\n\nMajor events are also planned around the world in Australia, in Europe \u2013 in Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam \u2013 and in the US in New York and Washington DC.\n\nThe stars posed for pictures showing their support for ER just hours after activists coated the government building in red liquid as part of their latest PR stunt to raise awareness\n\nProtesters claim the government 'only cares about economic growth' and not the environment. They promised to bring chaos to the capital for a fortnight, starting on Monday\n\nWorkers had to walk through the liquid as they attempted to get into the building. ER says it will close roads and cause mayhem around Westminster next week\n\nExtinction Rebellion is calling on the Government declare a climate and ecological emergency, act immediately to halt wildlife loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.\n\nThey want to see the Government create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens' Assembly on climate and ecological justice.\n\nEarlier in the year, Parliament declared a climate and environment emergency and the Government has passed a law to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, far later than the activists are demanding.\n\nMr Boardman said: 'Right now we're looking at a disastrous situation which demands so much radical action. It doesn't demand the piecemeal action we're currently seeing across the world.\n\n'It needs radical change to our system because currently what we're looking at is accelerating destruction, ecosystems across the world being wiped out at rates that are rapidly increasing.\n\n'It highlights we are in a system that is criminally failing us, a system, economically, that cannot handle what is happening, it needs change in a dramatic way.'", "description": "The stars posed with comic Asim Chaudry and US actor Crystal Clarke.  for a picture wearing ER badges\u00a0at the Royal Albert Hall last night to show their support for the climate change awareness group.", "authors": ["Shekhar Bhatia For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19293162-0-image-a-19_1570185537579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
