The alternative, he said, was the \u201cforced removal of Northern Ireland\u201d from the EU \u201cagainst its will.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Ireland needs to prepare for a border poll & plan for reunification; the alternative could be chaos\n\nNorthern Ireland voted to remain in the EU by a majority of 56 percent to 44 percent.\n\nHarvey and Bassett\u2019s paper was commissioned by Irish republican party Sinn F\u00e9in and its left-wing parliamentary group Gue/NGL.\n\nHarvey said that the EU accepted that Irish reunification would be seen as similar to German reunification in the sense that it would entail the expansion of an existing territory and not a new accession which needed its own accession process, the newspaper reported. The right to self-determination of people was also enshrined in international law, Bassett said.\n\nThe Irish government, led by the center-right Fine Gael and propped up by center-right Fianna Fail, has been reluctant to bring up the issue of Irish unity in the context of Brexit, preferring instead to push for Britain to strike a deal with Brussels which averts the need for a hard border to be implemented and maintains the status quo.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Not about winning some stupid blame game\u2019: EU\u2019s Tusk loses temper with BoJo over Brexit\n\nHarvey said the government needed to be realistic about the future and recognize that people are having that discussion whether they like it or not.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to start tonight to have a conversation about referendums that are coming,\u201d he said.\n\nOne Fine Gael MEP at the meeting, Se\u00e1n Kelly, admitted that while he did not favor an immediate unity referendum, that Brexit had \u201cchanged the attitude and culture in Ireland\u201d around the issue. \u201cPeople are now talking about a united Ireland that were never considering it five years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MEP Matt Carthy added that his party was not advocating for a referendum immediately, but that the message for the government was that there was a need to start planning for the inevitable.\n\nIt's not the first time the Irish government has been prodded to begin preparing for a unity referendum. Sinn F\u00e9in has repeatedly called for the government to establish a national Forum for Unity, saying that Dublin has a duty to plan for the future, saying Brexit has highlighted the importance of not embarking on major constitutional change without adequate preparation. Over two years ago Fianna F\u00e1il said it was working on a 12-point plan for a united Ireland, but it has still not produced any document.\n\nRead more\n\nPolls in the Republic of Ireland have consistently shown a clear majority in favor of reunification. In the north, which is heavily divided along political and sectarian lines, the results are more murky, but some polls have shown increased support for unity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAs Brexit chaos drags on, fears have grown that any deal (or no-deal) which creates havoc at the border is likely to increase the risk of violence and put a hard-won peace process at risk.\n\nThe authors of the report noted that a path to unity had already been carved out by the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) and the Irish Constitution. Under the terms of the GFA, a vote must be held (and pass) on both sides of the border for unity to be won.\n\nLike this story?
