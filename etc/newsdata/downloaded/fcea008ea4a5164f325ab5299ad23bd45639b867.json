I have to sleep with it. I have to get up with it.\u201d These are the heartrending words of Shailendra Sukhraj, the father from Chatsworth, Durban, who made headlines last year when he shot and killed his little girl while the family car was being hijacked.\n\nThe story struck a chord with people across the country with parents who couldn\u2019t imagine the agony he was going through, as well as with millions of crime-weary citizens. Here was a man who had tried to protect his family. Instead it had all gone catastrophically wrong.\n\nShailendra and his wife, Lorraine, are speaking for the first time of the nightmare their family has endured \u2013 an ordeal thrust back into the public eye after the recent sentencing of one of the hijackers.\n\nSibonelo Mkhize (39) was jailed for life for aggravated robbery and for the murders of nine-year-old Sadia and Mkzhize\u2019s accomplice, Siyabonga Bulose. Even though it was Shailendra who pulled the trigger, Judge Esther Steyn found Mkhize guilty as his actions had led to both the deaths.\n\nUnder laws of common purpose, an accused can be held responsible for crimes they did not commit if, by their conduct, they must have foreseen the crimes could be committed.\n\n\u201cOrdinary citizens should not go through what Mr and Mrs Sukhraj went through on an ordinary day while taking their daughter to school,\u201d the judge said.\n\nThey have been robbed of their beautiful young child, she added, who must have been terrified in her final moments. For Shailendra and Lorraine, the fact the man responsible is behind bars is scant comfort. Nothing can fill the void their little girl\u2019s death has left behind.\n\n\u201cWhatever you could want in a child, she was all of it,\u201d Shailendra says. \u201cShe was a people person, even at that age. She was extraordinary.\u201d\n\nMonday morning 28 May 2018 began as usual formthe Sukhraj family: wake up, get dressed, get the kids up, give them breakfast, drop off the kids, head to work. Shailendra (41), a sales rep and pastor, and Lorraine (39), a doctor\u2019s receptionist, piled Sadia and her baby brother, Jaziel (then six months), into the family\u2019s Hyundai Tucson. They headed for Lorraine\u2019s mom\u2019s house in nearby Shallcross to drop off Jaziel, who was cared for by his granny while his parents were at work.\n\n\u201cWe got into the driveway, switched off the car and exited it,\u201d Shailendra recalls.\n\n\u201cAs my wife went into my mother-inlaw\u2019s house with Jaziel, I started to get whatever was needed for the baby from the car and went inside.\u201d\n\nSadia waited in the backseat of the car as usual while her parents got her little brother settled. Two or three minutes later, Lorraine went outside to their car and Shailendra heard her scream, \u201cOh my God! There\u2019s somebody in the driveway!\u201d\n\nShailendra rushed outside and one of the two hijackers pointed a gun at him and demanded the car keys. He handed them over and retreated towards the house.\n\n\u201cSadia was still in the car. I had to submit to the request because my life and my family\u2019s lives were under threat. From the moment I handed over the keys and went back in the house, I knew this spelt trouble,\u201d he says.\n\nAs soon as he got back inside, Shailendra pulled out his firearm. As a travelling salesman he always had a gun on him as he often drove through dangerous areas. Moments later, he came out of the house again and was prepared to do whatever necessary to keep the hijackers from driving away with Sadia, who was sitting directly behind the front passenger seat.\n\n\u201cI could see her. My mind was focused on her as they were driving off and I knew I needed to stop the vehicle.\u201d\n\nRape. Human trafficking. Those were the thoughts that flickered through his mind as he shot at the car, he says, desperately trying to save Sadia.\n\n\u201cI wanted to stop the car. Instinct kicks in at the spur of the moment. It\u2019s very easy when you\u2019re not in the situation [to criticise my decision] but when you\u2019re in the moment it\u2019s extremely difficult,\u201d he says.\n\nHe was firing at the driver but the car kept going until it crashed into the gate, then into a parked car in the road. When the car struck the gate, the impact caused the rear passenger door to swing open. That was the last time Shailendra saw his daughter alive.\n\n\u201cAs a father you just want your child back . . . but it never happened.\u201d\n\nSadia was struck in the chest by one of the bullets from her father\u2019s gun. She was rushed to hospital but it was too late to save her.\n\nBulose died of gunshot wounds too and Mkhize was arrested near the scene by an off-duty policeman, Warrant Officer Hemant Raghoonundan.\n\nShailendra and Lorraine are still trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. It\u2019s not getting any easier but they are going through the healing process with the help of spiritual counselling, professional counselling and support from friends, family and their community.\n\nThey also have each other to turn to. The tragedy, Shailendra says, has made their marriage stronger.\n\n\u201cMy wife has her bad days and I have my bad days. We look to each other for support and that has really strengthened our marriage.\n\n\u201cAfter what has happened there\u2019s a sense of guilt, of course there is. It\u2019s not something we could take an eraser to and remove from our thoughts.\u201d\n\nEven during all the pain, Lorraine can\u2019t help but smile when she recalls how her little girl would fill the house with song and dance every day.\n\n\u201cShe was full of life, bubbly and a real gem,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was beautiful inside and out, in every aspect of the word.\u201d\n\nSadia would\u2019ve turned 10 this year and her parents had so much hope for their talented child. Now they channel their love into Jaziel (now 1), their faith, the community and each other.\n\nDespite everything the couple have chosen not to harbour feelings of anger towards Mkhize.\n\n\u201cIn court he didn\u2019t show a stitch of remorse,\u201d Shailendra says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve let it go. It\u2019s crystal clear in the Bible that if I have any inequity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me so I have released that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d Lorraine says, \u201cbecause at the end of the day it\u2019s not going to bring my child back.\u201d\n\nShailendra believes their beloved Sadia\u2019s brief life was a meaningful one.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the lives she touched, yes, she\u2019s served her purpose. She\u2019s touched so many lives in her way it\u2019s unbelievable.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is love, and love conquers all. Sadia had love.\u201d", "description": "The Durban dad who fired the bullet that killed his daughter during a botched hijacking opens up on feelings of guilt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9467/b0cabfc4a74b4eedb9f5d2db7e951262.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
