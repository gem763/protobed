He says the caucus was contacted anonymously about a noose being hung on August 28, the 56th anniversary of the March on Washington led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., when he gave his historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The group contacted the academy.\n\nJenny Erickson, a Naval Academy spokeswoman, said in an email to The Washington Post that the school didn't learn of the discovery until the following week.\n\nBuck said while it's possible the noose was part of a hoisting system to complete ductwork, the academy will investigate it because it \"takes all allegations of race hate very seriously and is working quickly and diligently to determine the facts surrounding the reported incident, specifically why the reported incident was not brought to light sooner.\"\n\nCBS Baltimore quotes Snowden as saying, \"Nooses, like swastikas, conjure up images of a dark past. We appreciate the fact that the U.S. Naval Academy Superintendent Vice Admiral Sean Buck has instructed his staff to look into this matter.\"", "description": "Discovery was made on 56th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/10/72feef53-b154-4532-a6d0-8218ca86a78b/thumbnail/1200x630/8360a5c06a8e7ce30df174507764203f/naval-academy-noose-august-and-september-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
