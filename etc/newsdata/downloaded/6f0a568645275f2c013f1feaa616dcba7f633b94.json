In September an FCC filing surfaced that revealed SpaceX is ready to launch into the next testing phase for its Starship\n\nSpaceX hopes its style of reusable rocket will mark a major breakthrough in aerospace technology that will eventually make exploration cheaper and more sustainable.\n\nUltimately, Musk hopes that the company's Starship could help humans reach Mars for the first time and has set an optimistic timeline for when the experimental craft might be able to do so.\n\nThe first crewed Red Planet mission for the rocket and 100-passenger Starship could come as early as the mid-2020s if development and testing go well, Musk has said\n\nAdditional missions may even include tourists trips to the moon by 2024, according to the CEO.", "description": "In aerial footage taken by videographer John Winkopp, the Starship craft's shimmering stainless steel body can be seen taking ship at the company's facility in Cocoa, Florida.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/18/19895776-0-image-a-2_1571419683963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
