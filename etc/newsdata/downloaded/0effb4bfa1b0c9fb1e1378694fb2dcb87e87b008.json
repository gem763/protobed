Former Boston Celtics star and current ESPN analyst Paul Pierce isn't buying what KD is selling.\n\n\"This is part of what I'm talking about,\" Pierce said Wednesday on \"The Jump.\" \"You played for the No. 1 offense on the planet, you guys are winning championships, but then there's a complaint. Like, of course, the defense is going to get tougher the later rounds you get, but at some point -- yeah, you intermix a lot of 1-on-1 with the system. The system worked! It wasn't broken, and the reason they lost this year was because of the injuries. This is the type of stuff I'm talking about with KD. I don't get what he's searching for. Like it worked what you were doing.\"\n\nNail meet head.\n\n[RELATED: Draymond knows 'no one' wants to play Dubs in playoffs]\n\nStory continues\n\nDurant will be out for most of, if not all of this upcoming season as he rehabs his ruptured Achilles. Will the Nets feature the offense KD is searching for when he returns?\n\nWhile he and Irving should form a deadly combo, it's hard to see the Nets' offense being more effective than Kerr's system.\n\nWhy Paul Pierce disagrees with Kevin Durant's critique of Warriors' offense originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Paul Pierce won this round.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Mq_NPRvRwEfo_id_oiME4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9XVhIvbpndFpHrByVmb5_Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/3f51f3787f5085b0b57c38f200fc555a", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
