A BA spokesperson said: \u201cWe and the union\u2019s leaders agreed and shook on a deal on Monday 12 August only for the union to backtrack on that agreement and return with new and unrealistic demands.\n\n\u201cBalpa has cynically waited until we have helped the vast majority of customers with alternative travel arrangements, and our planning for a strike has reached a critical stage.\n\n\u201cWe remain open to constructive talks with Balpa to resolve the pay negotiations, but we do not believe the union is acting in good faith by making an eleventh hour inflated proposal which would cost an additional \u00a350m.\u201d\n\nThe union says the gap between the airline and the pilots is only \u00a35m annually.\n\nThe strike will cost British Airways between \u00a375m and \u00a380m in lost revenue, plus extra costs in customer care.\n\nFlight crew working for BA\u2019s CityFlyer operation at London City are not involved in the dispute.", "description": "Heathrow Terminal 5, which\u00a0normally handles 90,000 passengers on nearly 600 flights each day, will be eerily quiet on Monday and Tuesday\u00a0next week.
