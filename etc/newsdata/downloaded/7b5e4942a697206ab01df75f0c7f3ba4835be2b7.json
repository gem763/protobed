Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler and Elijah Cummings cited Giuliani\u2019s cable news appearances, saying the former New York City mayor \u201cadmitted on national television that, while serving as the president\u2019s personal attorney, he asked the government of Ukraine to target\u201d Biden.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence \u2014 in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications \u2014 indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

Democrats are also seeking to learn if State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl was listening in as well. On Friday, Democrats subpoenaed Pompeo for documents related to the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThirteen minutes after the Wall Street Journal\u2019s story on Pompeo was published, the New York Times reported that Trump sought additional foreign help with his political troubles. In a recent phone call with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the Times reported, Trump sought information that could help discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. That investigation was kicked off, in part, by the disclosure that former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos had discussed the Russian efforts with an Australian diplomat in London.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how Trump would benefit from reopening questions about the Mueller investigation, which ended in April with the publication of a report that Trump claimed, inaccurately, exonerated him completely.\n\nJust as with Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, the White House restricted access to transcripts of his call with Morrison.\n\nAt 5:11 p.m. ET, the Washington Post reported that Attorney General William Barr also sought foreign assistance in building a case to discredit the Mueller report, by contacting British intelligence officials and personally traveling to Italy last week to meet with officials.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Within the span of just over an hour, a slew of news dropped that could affect the chances President Trump will be impeached.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3aJjAx.1wOjoN7Bdz2ngVg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/11482760-e3c3-11e9-95f7-1150406b4805", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
