The 29-year-old did not emerge for the start of England\u2019s training session in Sapporo, and when he did finally appear he remained separated from the rest of the squad, raising serious concerns over his fitness ahead of Sunday\u2019s clash.\n\nWith Vunipola already ruled out of the opening pool games against Tonga and the USA, the loss of Marler would leave England short on options at loosehead prop, with only Ellis Genge available to start. Luke Cowan-Dickie, the Exeter Chiefs hooker, would be able to cover loosehead if needed having played there when he was younger.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

England vs Tonga predicted team 1/24 England vs Tonga Who should Eddie Jones select in his opening squad for the Rugby World Cup? Reuters 2/24 1. Joe Marler With Vunipola absent, Jones would be wise to go with experience and Marler\u2019s XX caps bring just that. The Harlequins prop looked to have no chance of featuring at the World Cup when he retired last season, but could end up being the first name on the teamsheet in the opening match of the campaign. REUTERS 3/24 2. Jamie George The expectation is that Jones will go fully loaded for the opening game and then look to rest his best players where possible, given it will give them just under two weeks to prepare for their Argentina test. George is certainly one of those, and with two other hookers in the squad in Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jack Singleton, Jones can afford to give George a good hit-out before standing him down for the week. Getty Images 4/24 3. Kyle Sinckler This selection doesn\u2019t seem to be too much of an issue, given that Kyle Sinckler will bring form, power and pace to the pack if selected against Tonga while Dan Cole has a vast amount of experience at World Cups to deal with the job at hand. However, given the physicality of the Pacific Islanders, it might be sensible to deploy Sinckler first to give Tonga a few problems of their own. Getty Images 5/24 4. Maro Itoje Now we start to get to the tricky positions. If Mark Wilson fails to get through full training as he manages a knee injury, then he cannot realistically be considered for the opening fixture. That could then leave England in a bit of a whole, and as a result, we\u2019re selecting Itoje to play just 40 minutes. Jones could then send on Courtney Lawes for the second 40, with both slated to start against the USA. EPA 6/24 5. George Kruis Joining Itoje in the second row is his Saracens colleague George Kruis. The lock has enjoyed a wonderful return to form over the last year and his lineout expertise could prove a handy tool against Tonga, whose set-piece could prove a weakness. Getty Images 7/24 6. Tom Curry The absence of Wilson, if he fails to recover, leaves Jones with a tricky situation. He could start the inexperienced Lewis Ludlam on the blindside, deploy Courtney Lawes there, or choose to go with his double-openside tactic of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. It\u2019s the latter that we\u2019re going for, as Curry fills the No 6 shirt having impressed in the World Cup warm-up games. EPA 8/24 7. Sam Underhill Underhill takes the No 7 shirt to provide England with that double-edge at the breakdown. If England can disrupt Tongan possession and slow them down at the ruck, it negates a lot of their best qualities. Both Curry and Underhill would then be stood down for the second match, allowing Lawes to start at 6 and Ludlam to start on the openside. EPA 9/24 8. Billy Vunipola It looks guaranteed that Vunipola will start against the country of his heritage with Wilson struggling, and as Jones has said over the last few weeks, the best way to get him at his best is to get the No 8 playing minutes. That could potentially see Vunipola double up and face the USA too, but it\u2019s hoped that Wilson will be back in time to start. EPA 10/24 9. Ben Youngs Youngs remains the first-choice scrum-half for now and should get the nod to start the campaign unless Willi Heinz has done enough in training to oust him from the shirt. REUTERS 11/24 10. George Ford England are keen to stay away from the brutality that will be thrown their way from the Tonga defence, and as such it looks like George Ford will start alongside Owen Farrell to ensure the ball is moved around to the outside backs. Ford impressed in playing every game of the warm-up series, and deserves to start the opening match on merit alone. REUTERS 12/24 11. Jonny May Just wind him up and let him go. May\u2019s in the form of his life, and will start in Japan as their first-choice wing. Getty Images 13/24 12. Owen Farrell Farrell captains the team from the No 12 shirt \u2013 which he returned to for the record victory over Ireland last month \u2013 in order to add that creativity to the midfield. Farrell is big enough to bring the physicality needed in an inside centre, but it\u2019s the ability to move the ball outside him that will be the most important quality needed. Action Images via Reuters 14/24 13. Manu Tuilagi It seems the smartest thing to do in selecting Tuilagi to fight power with power against Tonga, and then wrap him up in cotton wool for the Argentina game. With Henry Slade short on minutes after a knee injury ruled him out of the warm-up games, and Jonathan Joseph down the pecking order, Tuilagi could cause havoc in the opening game \u2013 but he is needed for much later in the tournament and a 50-minute hit-out before giving Slade minutes looks the best option. Getty Images 15/24 14. Anthony Watson This is where the back-line selection gets tricky. With Nowell injured, England will have to reply on Elliot Daly and Anthony Watson looking after the No 15 shirt. However, Joe Cokanasiga is another who has struggled with a knee injury this week, and you wouldn\u2019t want to expose Ruaridh McConnochie to the Tongans in his first fully competitive international Test. As a result, Watson will be needed to start on the wing. Action Images via Reuters 16/24 15. Elliot Daly Daly could be another player forced to double-up, as you would rather push the new Saracens addition to go back-to-back rather than Watson, given the latter\u2019s recent injury problems. Daly has proven he has that in him before, having played back-to-back between on the Lions tour ahead of the first Test, and with Nowell returning later in the tournament, Daly could be rested in one of the latter pool games. PA 17/24 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie Seems to be the natural understudy to George given that Jack Singleton is yet to play any minutes at hooker. Action Images via Reuters 18/24 17. Ellis Genge Could play a pivotal role in this World Cup off the bench as he did against Italy, with his injection of power likely to sap the energy reserves of the Tongan pack.

Getty Images 24/24 23. Joe Cokanasiga/Ruaridh McConnochie If fit, Cokanasiga takes the final place on the bench as he can bring a second-half impact on the wing and Watson can cover full-back should anything happen to Daly.

Those two in particular we were talking about the other day are back in training.\n\n\u201cMako and Jack Nowell are on target for later in the tournament.\u201d\n\nNowell went through a lengthy sprint session as he continues his recovery from ankle surgery, with the wing still on target to return for the second half of the pool stage. Vunipola, who underwent hamstring surgery last May and aggravated the scar tissue in last month\u2019s warm-up victory over Ireland, is also targeting a return for the third pool game against Argentina after completing a live scrummaging session with the rest of the squad this week.", "description": "Joe Marler has emerged as a concern for England\u2019s opening Rugby World Cup clash against Tonga after missing their Thursday afternoon training session.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/11/Joe-Marler.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
