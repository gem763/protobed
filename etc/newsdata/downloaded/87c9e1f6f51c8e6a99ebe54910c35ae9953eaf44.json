Jimmy Gomez. | Joe Scarnici/Getty Images trade More Dems see path to resolving new NAFTA differences\n\nHouse Democrats said Thursday they believe they are making progress with the Trump administration over how to fix their concerns with the new North American trade agreement, indicating a congressional vote on the measure is still possible this year.\n\nSeveral lawmakers told POLITICO they had not yet seen the text U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer delivered on Wednesday in response to their concerns. But they said the fact that USTR had responded provided a boost to negotiations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that they got that first response out of the way, because I think that usually helps get the ball rolling a little bit more and shows people that folks are serious,\u201d said Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.), one of the nine members of Democrats\u2019 USMCA working group, which is leading the party\u2019s negotiations with Lighthizer.\n\nThe formal responses USTR delivered on Wednesday afternoon marked the administration\u2019s first attempt to address concerns Democrats have for months been raising with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement\u2019s labor, environmental, enforcement and prescription drug provisions.\n\nGomez said congressional staffers were reviewing the responses ahead of a series of meetings next week: first among members of the working group, and then with Lighthizer.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

And then we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two sides are likely to spend the next several weeks exchanging texts as the Trump administration continues to push for Congress to pass the agreement before the end of the year.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the administration wants to \"get this thing done within the next 30 to 60 days,\" \u2014 a timeline House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) also embraced on Thursday.\n\nBut other Democrats maintain they will not be pushed to vote on the deal until they are able to make at least some changes to reflect the party's priorities.\n\n\u201cWe have to finish our back-and-forth,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters during her weekly press briefing. \u201cWe\u2019ve made an offer, they\u2019ve made an offer, now we sit down and see where we can find our common ground.\u201d\n\nOnce the administration sends the final bill to Congress, neither chamber is allowed to add amendments to the bill under fast-track rules. But Pelosi has the power to change those rules to remove the deal from fast-track, which she could do if the Trump administration decides to send it without waiting for her nod. Administration officials have so far said they will not do so.\n\nPelosi emphasized Thursday that before the administration sends the final bill, Democrats need to see changes that ensure it is fully enforceable \u2014 something she said may require making changes to the text of the deal itself.\n\nThat could prove to be a sticking point with the Trump administration, which has so far been resistant to making changes within the pact and instead wants to strike side agreements to address Democrats\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cIf you have a sidebar letter that says we\u2019re going to have enforcement, that does not have the force of a treaty. You have to have enforcement in the body of the treaty,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nShe added that \u201cmay require surgically \u2014 not opening it up for any and all, but surgically \u2014 having more clarity and more standing on what the enforcement is within the agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case,\u201d Pelosi said, \u201cwe think we\u2019re making progress.\u201d\n\nThat optimism was apparent on both sides of the aisle. Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, called it \u201cgood news\u201d that House Democrats were \u201clooking thoughtfully at the proposal\u201d from the trade chief.\n\nBrady, who formerly was chairman of House Ways and Means, said he believes the two sides are focusing first on finding solutions to concerns that House Democrats have raised about the agreement and would decide later the best way to implement any changes, including whether to reopen talks with Canada and Mexico.\n\n\"As you know, there are a number of ways to fine tune an agreement,\u201d the Texas Republican said, \u201cand I think that will be the second step.\u201d\n\nDoug Palmer contributed to this report.", "description": "Comments from lawmakers indicate that Trump\u2019s signature trade deal could get a vote this year.", "authors": ["Megan Cassella"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f6/12/25eaa1074daa8ef141da473c6d9d/190114-jimmy-gomez-getty-773.jpg"}
