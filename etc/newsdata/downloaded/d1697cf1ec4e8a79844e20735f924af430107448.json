Yes. Has his trainer put his home for sale? Yes. Has he set up his contract to void after this season to become a free agent? Yes. So if he\u2019s selling his home and his trainer is selling his home and he\u2019s voiding his contract? What does that tell you? He\u2019s setting up to move on.\u201d\n\nSchefter added: \u201cThere are many times people set up things in their lives to move on and they walk to the abyss, look down and say, \u2018Whoa, I\u2019m not jumping now.' So he could change his mind.\u201d\n\nSAM DARNOLD'S PERFORMANCE VS. PATRIOTS GETS SPOOKY IN JETS BLOWOUT LOSS: 'I'M SEEING GHOSTS'\n\nSchefter didn\u2019t clarify what \u201cmove on\u201d meant. Whether it means to move on from the Patriots or move on from football altogether was unclear.\n\nIt is certain that Brady, 42, did put his Brookline, Mass., home on the market in the summer, as did his trainer Alex Guerrero with his Norfolk home, according to Mass Live.\n\nIf he is planning on moving, it appears it would be news to everyone. Brady \u2013 who put up 249 passing yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 33-0 win over the Jets \u2013 doesn\u2019t appear to be finished playing football just yet.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nNew England is undefeated this season and poised to get back to the Super Bowl.", "description": "Rumors about Tom Brady\u2019s departure from the New England Patriots swirled Monday night after an NFL insider theorized that there were signs the six-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback was plotting an exit.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
