It's likely (looking at the precedent of Monarch's collapse) that any announcement about that will be made late at night, once all planes are on the ground. But the company doesn't have to announce anything until the markets open at 07:00 BST on Monday.\n\nIt's low season at the moment, the time of year when Thomas Cook has to pay its suppliers for the busy summer season just gone. Hoteliers are paid on 60 to 90-day terms, once travellers have already taken their holidays. The nightmare scenario is that hoteliers who don't think they will get paid might turn out the people staying with them.\n\nHowever, it is worth re-stating that the company is still trading. People are still holidaying with Thomas Cook. And while we can assume the company is reining back marketing activity around last-minute deals and offers, until any announcement is made, it is business as usual.\n\nThe foreign secretary said he did not want talk of contingency planning to become \"a self-fulfilling prophecy\".\n\nHe told the BBC the government had learned lessons from the collapse of the Monarch airline in 2017. The UK's consular authorities abroad were ready to assist, he said.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Thomas Cook has hundreds of High Street stores\n\nA government spokesperson described the situation as a \"worrying time for holidaymakers and employees\".\n\nThey added: \"The financial circumstances of individual businesses are a commercial matter, but the government and the Civil Aviation Authority are monitoring the situation closely.\"\n\n'Held hostage'\n\nImage copyright Gary Seale\n\nAs Thomas Cook customers anxiously wait to see if and how their holidays might be affected, some say they have already found themselves in \"horrible\" situations abroad.\n\nCustomers at a hotel in Tunisia say they were prevented from leaving the property on Saturday unless they paid extra fees - thousands of pounds in some cases - to cover what the resort says it is owed by the tour operator.\n\n\"We're being held hostage,\" said Ryan Farmer, from Leicestershire, one of those staying at Les Orangers resort in Hammamet, near Tunis.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 5 Live the hotel asked everyone who was due to leave that day to come to reception, where they were asked to pay \"additional fees, obviously because of the situation with Thomas Cook\".\n\nGary Seale, who is also at the resort, said he was hoping to catch a flight back to Manchester - but refused to pay the additional fees and was not allowed to leave.\n\n\"It's been very fraught but it hasn't got to fisticuffs yet,\" he said.\n\nRescue call\n\nThere are currently 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British.\n\nOne of the world's largest travel companies, Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of \u00a39bn.\n\nIt employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of whom are in the UK, and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries.\n\nIn July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed \u00a3900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of \u00a3150m. The \u00a3900m would come from China's Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors.\n\nThe group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional \u00a3200m on top of the \u00a3900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to \u00a31.1bn.\n\nThomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional \u00a3200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out.\n\nThe firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.\n\nTSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes has called on Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom to help Thomas Cook \"no matter what\", saying it would save thousands of jobs.\n\nBrian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said: \"Ministers need to step forward and take responsibility for the sake of passengers and staff.\n\n\"There is a real risk that if the worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowing if they have a job or will even get paid for this month.\"\n\nShadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said \"the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis\".\n\nWhat are your rights?\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nIf you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).\n\nThe scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.\n\nAtol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.\n\nIf you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme.\n\nIf you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.\n\nWhen Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.\n\nHere is more information on Atol protection and Your questions answered\n\nAre you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?
