Whether he escapes and goes on the run or ends up enduring a lengthy prison spell remains to be seen but either way, everything that they have fought to build up over the years is cruelly shattered.\n\nInevitably, this leaves Aaron in a very dark and vulnerable place. With a history of aggression, depression and self harm, the popular character will hit self destruct and return to his old ways \u2013 getting himself into serious trouble.\n\nWorrying the likes of mum Chas (Lucy Pargeter) and sister Liv (Isobel Steele), is there any way back for Aaron as he heads over the edge?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to Inside Soap, Emmerdale\u2019s producer Kate Brooks revealed: \u2018When a big character like Robert exits, there is huge story potential in terms of kicking off the next chapter for Aaron.\n\n\u2018Robert leaving is going to hit him hard. He is the love of Aaron\u2019s life whom he adored, and has kept Aaron anchored and on the straight and narrow. So when the rug is pulled from underneath his feet, it really affects Aaron and it makes him behave in ways that he wouldn\u2019t normally.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I think we\u2019re going to see the Aaron of old, before Robert came along and straightened him out. We have loads of great stuff for Danny and Isobel, as they try to navigate their world without Robert in it.\u2019\n\nRyan\u2019s final scenes as Robert air this week.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "He returns to the Aaron of old.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SEI_73520166_1571142750.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
