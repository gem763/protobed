But investor skepticism led to We Company considering earlier this month a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.\n\nWe Company had vowed to press ahead with an IPO by the end of the year. But there was little sign that IPO investor sentiment would change, threatening the value of the stakes held not just by outside investors, but by Neumann as well.\n\nWhat was the venture capital world\u2019s biggest upset then morphed into one of corporate America\u2019s most high-profile boardroom dramas.\n\nSoftBank managed to muster enough opposition to Neumann in a meeting of We Company\u2019s seven-member board on Tuesday to convince him to step down. Reuters had reported on Monday that Neumann had engaged in talks about changes to his role.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\u201d Neumann said in a statement.\n\nArtie Minson, currently chief financial officer of We Company, and Sebastian Gunningham, a vice chairman for the New York-based start-up, will become co-chief executives, the company said. Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman, the company added.\n\nMinson, a former chief financial officer of Time Warner Cable who joined We Company in 2015, will oversee its finance, legal, human resources, real estate and public communications. Gunningham, a former executive at Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) who joined We Company last year, will take responsibility for product, design, development, sales, marketing, technology and regional teams.\n\nWe Company is considering slowing its expansion so it burns through less cash and would require less funding in the absence of an IPO in the near team, Reuters reported on Monday. The company is also contemplating laying off staff, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.\n\n\u201cWhile we anticipate difficult decisions ahead, each decision will be made with rigorous analysis, always bearing in mind the company\u2019s long-term interests and health,\u201d Minson and Gunningham wrote in an internal company memo seen by Reuters.\n\nNeumann also agreed to reduce the power of his voting shares, losing majority voting control, according to the sources. Each of his shares will now have the same voting rights as three We Company common shares, not the 10 common shares previously, the sources said.\n\nRelated Coverage WeWork bond price bounces in choppy trading after CEO to step down\n\nNeumann\u2019s shares used to have the same voting power as 20 We Company common shares, before he agreed to reduce his grip slightly earlier this month in an unsuccessful attempt to make the IPO more attractive to investors.\n\nNeumann\u2019s wife Rebekah also found herself without a job at We Company as part of the changes, one of the sources said. She was co-chief brand and impact officer.\n\nShe is also the founder and CEO of WeGrow, an elementary school set up by We Company. However, We Company has decided to do away with such ventures that are not core to the WeWork brand, the source added. We Company declined to comment on Rebekah Neumann\u2019s role.\n\nWe Company said on Tuesday it was now evaluating the \u201coptimal timing\u201d for an IPO.\n\nFIRM GRIP\n\nNeumann, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $2.2 billion, developed a cult following among many We Company employees, vowing to \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d as he sought to establish WeWork as a brand that transcended office sharing.\n\nWhile his investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities over the decade he led WeWork since its founding in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company\u2019s IPO underway.\n\nDuring the attempts to woo IPO investors this month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.\n\nThese included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.\n\nNeumann had also entered several transactions with We Company, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent. He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.\n\nLATE CONCESSIONS\n\nFollowing criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control. He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has reached with the New York-based firm.\n\nThese changes did little to address concerns about the business model for We Company, which rents workspace to clients under short-term contracts, even though it pays rent under long-term leases. This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Adam Neumann, CEO of WeWork, speaks to guests during the TechCrunch Disrupt event in Manhattan, in New York City, NY, U.S. May 15, 2017.
