It is up to the EU to decide whether to extend Britain's Oct. 31 deadline for its departure.\n\nAdam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said Brexit was driving a \"general risk-off tone\".\n\n\"Things could change very quickly today, depending on the EU response,\" he said. He added that he did not see \"much downside\" risk now that a no-deal Brexit was off the table.\n\nMorten Lund, a senior strategist at Nordea, said that markets were reacting to the likelihood of a U.K. election.\n\nThe Japanese yen rose to 108.25 per dollar, its strongest since Oct. 15, before settling at 108.380, up 0.1% on the day. Versus the Australian dollar, the yen strengthened as much as 0.5%.\n\nThe Swiss franc, which investors also tend to buy when they feel nervous, rose 0.1% to 1.1006 francs per euro.\n\nThe euro edged lower to $1.1120 before Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, outgoing president Mario Draghi's final policy meeting.\n\nThe dollar index was flat at 97.547.\n\nSterling slipped as low as $1.2842 in Asia, then recovered to $1.2877 as London opened. That left the pound more than one cent off Monday's five-and-a-half-month high.\n\nThe Swedish crown was little changed against the euro at 10.737 crowns per euro and the Norwegian crown continued the losses that saw it reach a record low against the euro last week. The euro added 0.3% against the Norwegian currency to 10.2075 crowns.\n\nAustralia's dollar dropped 0.2% to $0.684 as risk aversion knocked a currency considered a barometer for investors' moods.", "description": "The Japanese yen rose to a one-week high and the Swiss franc gained on Wednesday as investors sought safer assets after British lawmakers forced a delay in the UK government's Brexit plans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104878830-GettyImages-860933720.jpg?v=1571808643", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
