It took a record 29% of the vote in 2015 and is now polling at 27%.\n\nLevels of concern about immigration have fallen significantly, according to polling for the state broadcaster RTS, with only 19% of voters saying it will determine how they vote \u2013 behind climate change, healthcare premiums and relations with the EU.\n\nMichael Hermann, of the polling firm Sotomo, told the Swiss broadcaster RTS that the shift from immigration to climate as the country\u2019s top political issue was one of the most dramatic pivots he had seen in Swiss politics. The \u201cgreen wave is rolling along\u201d, he said.\n\nThe SVP is the only party currently on Switzerland\u2019s federal council to contest the reality of the climate crisis, with both the Socialists and the two centre-right parties pushing markedly environmentally friendly policies.\n\nLast month 100,000 people \u2013 a significant turnout for a country of 8.5 million \u2013 marched through the Swiss capital, Bern, demanding comprehensive climate action from the next government.", "description": "Polling suggests climate crisis will be a key factor for more than a quarter of voters", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f60ab6761227f65e6af3275f41860532320de7/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30c38073b86ba6973e276dfcc7213fe2", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
