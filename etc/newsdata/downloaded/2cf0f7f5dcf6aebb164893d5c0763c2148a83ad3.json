It\u2019s a great country with great people,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nSo what was he congratulating?\n\nUnclear, but the ceremony he was supposed to attend commemorated the Nazi invasion of Poland 80 years ago.\n\n\n\nGerman tanks cross a river into Polish territory on Sept. 6, 1939.

By the time they were done, they had flattened nearly three-quarters of the city, including a hospital and a Gothic church. As many as 1,200 civilians were killed that day, according to the Polish government. There were no Polish troops stationed at Wielun, and destroying it served no strategic purpose \u2014 Nazi Germany attacked it simply to sow terror, according to the BBC.\n\n\n\nZofia Burchacinska, an eyewitness to the bombing of Wielun in 1939, holds a picture of the destroyed town on Aug. 20, 2019.

Poland had had a nonaggression agreement with Germany since 1934, but the Nazis invented a reason to violate it, staging a fake Polish attack on German radio.\n\nA few hours after the attack began, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler went before the Reichstag and went on a tirade against Poland.\n\n\n\nThe Nazi invasion of Poland and the start of World War II were just a few hours old when Adolf Hitler went before the Reichstag in Berlin on Sept. 1, 1939, to deliver a war tirade. (AP)\n\nTwo days later, France and England declared war on Germany, marking the start of World War II.\n\nOver the following weeks, more than 2,000 German tanks and 1,000 German warplanes pulverized the western part of Poland. After the Germans surrounded Warsaw and bombed it, the city surrendered to the Nazis on Sept. 27, 1939.\n\nMeanwhile the Soviet Union, which had secretly agreed not to defend Poland against the Nazis, invaded the eastern part of Poland, which fell on Oct. 6, 1939.\n\nOver the next six years, Nazis killed at least 5 million Polish citizens, nearly 1 in every 5 citizens, according to estimates. More than half of them were Polish Jews.\n\nThe Nazis\u2019 most notorious death camp, Auschwitz, where more than 1 million people were killed, is in southern Poland.\n\n\n\nA picture taken after the liberation by the Soviet army in January 1945 shows children wearing concentration-camp uniforms behind barbed wire in the Auschwitz camp. (AP)\n\nThe Soviet Union liberated Poland in 1945, but it continued to struggle. A \u201ccompliant\u201d government was promptly installed, according to the BBC, and Poland remained behind the Iron Curtain until 1989.\n\nIf \u201ccongratulations\u201d for this from Trump seems out of place, then it may be just as well that Pence went in his place. As The Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake wrote, Pence struck a solemn chord Sunday, saying, \u201cIt is difficult for any of us who are not Poles to fathom the horrors that began here 80 years ago, on this day.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nActivists slam Ocasio-Cortez for \u2018sanitizing\u2019 Eva Per\u00f3n.
