The manner he was communicating with me, we can never allow such in our game, regardless of his job. He must learn to respect coaches, period. He\u2019s probably in his late twenties, I didn\u2019t like his attitude.\u201d\n\nThe referee [Abongile Tom] was terrible\u201a he might as well have just put on a Kaizer Chiefs shirt Benni McCarthy, Cape Town City coach\n\nHowever, despite severe criticism early on in the season, Safa has only received three official complaints, according to Anastasia Tsichlas, the chairperson of Safa\u2019s referees committee.\n\nThis week, Tsichlas came out with guns blazing, urging the PSL to take action against its members \u2013 clubs and coaches.\n\nThe veteran administrator said it was unnecessary for coaches to use match officials as scapegoats and get away with it.\n\nShe said that, as much as Safa was sanctioning erring match officials, the league should also throw the book at coaches for bringing the game into disrepute.\n\nAlthough Tsichlas acknowledged that match officials had dropped the ball in some instances, she argued that they had been spot on in most of their decisions.\n\nYes, we agree that we are not perfect, but we are not too bad either Anastasia Tsichlas, chairperson of Safa\u2019s referees committee\n\nIn fact, she said, according to their statistics and reports, referees got it right 90% of the time, and this was encouraging and should be applauded.\n\n\u201cYes, we agree that we are not perfect, but we are not too bad either,\u201d Tsichlas told City Press.\n\n\u201cEach and every game, we always get perfect officiating. Sometimes they miss certain fouls or offside calls, but it is very rare that they miss important issues or make the kind of wrong decisions that have a negative effect on the outcome of the game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how football goes \u2013 you can never have a perfect game. Team officials, players, coaches or match officials will make mistakes. As long it is human error and does not affect the outcome of the game,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, we have had instances when they got it wrong, hence we have acted on those officials.\u201d\n\nThe former Mamelodi Sundowns owner said she was hoping to see coaches who were always on referees\u2019 cases also get punished.\n\n\u201cTo them, there is nothing good that our referees do, and this is so wrong and unacceptable. They always hide behind match officials.\u201d\n\nShe also pleaded with the public to support match officials, saying they were working under tremendous pressure.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to be a referee because all eyes are on you all the time. They have to be motivated and not always be judged on their mistakes. They are human beings and have given up their family lives because they are away on assignments every weekend.\u201d\n\nSometimes it is easy to blame somebody, in this case the referees, for your mistakes. Some coaches are an embarrassment as they don\u2019t even know the rules of the game, but they have so much to say Anastasia Tsichlas, chairperson of Safa\u2019s referees committee\n\nShe said she was happy with the strides that the referees\u2019 department had made in addressing their shortcomings.\n\n\u201cSometimes it is easy to blame somebody, in this case the referees, for your mistakes. Some coaches are an embarrassment as they don\u2019t even know the rules of the game, but they have so much to say.\u201d\n\nTsichlas said she felt the frustrations of club bosses because \u201cI was there also and was the worst critic\u201d.\n\n\u201cI feel what they sometimes go through because I have been there, hence I won\u2019t allow referees to get away with murder. I suffered most daylight robberies during my time at Sundowns and I know how it feels to be in their position.\n\n\u201cBut I also know how coaches behave as they try to buy their bosses\u2019 faces. I\u2019m still to meet a coach who will own up to his or her mistake \u2013 it is always about the next person.\u201d\n\nTsichlas said she had confidence in the different referees\u2019 subcommittees, particularly in the men and women serving on those panels.\n\n\u201cWe have assembled some of our best former officials to steer the ship in the right direction and we can see where we are going. The likes of Jerome [Damon], Enock [Molefe], Ari [Soldatos] and Didiza [Ngutshana] have officiated at the highest level, and bring a wealth of experience with them.\u201d\n\nShe said the review committee was working non-stop to speed up their cases \u2013 sometimes meeting up to three times a week.\n\n\u201cThe turnaround time has to change so that we get to decisions quickly and move on. But sometimes we are hampered by a lack of DVDs and damaged or incomplete footage. It\u2019s even worse with NFD matches as we sometimes only get highlights,\u201d said Tsichlas.", "description": "Despite the uproar over refereeing in the PSL, chairperson of the ref's committee, Anastasia Tsichlas, tells Timothy Molobi that action should be taken against the league's members, including clubs and coaches.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9398/62b9284944e04781804dc6ba42fd1dc6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
