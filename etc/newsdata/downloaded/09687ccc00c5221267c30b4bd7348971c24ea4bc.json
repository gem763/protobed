Yes, but\u2026", "language": "en", "text": "The fact we are a few weeks from NBA training camps opening and Carmelo Anthony doesn\u2019t have a contract is stunning. The point of sport is to put the leather ball through the metal hoop, and Anthony can still do that quite well.\n\nYet here we are. David Aldridge of The Athletic asked a dozen coaches and team executives if Anthony has a place in the NBA and basically got a lot of \u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d answers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCurrent NBA head coach: \u201cYes, with the right team. A vet team. Also, a team that is not looking at analytics. He is still a talent.\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of praise but most of it tempered of concerns in the responses. How things ended his last two stops \u2014 on the bench for key parts of the Thunder\u2019s playoff run, then out after just 10 games with the Rockets \u2014 plays into that. There\u2019s a lot of questions about fit, both him on specific rosters and him accepting a role. His \u201cteam\u201d is pushing back hard on the idea he\u2019s not a good teammate and would not accept a role.\n\nStill, the trepidation about that is out there.\n\nEastern Conference executive: \u201cIt\u2019s all about if he will accept a role. (He can be an) off the bench scorer and locker room positive influence. He could make $5-7 million.\u201d Western Conference assistant coach: \u201cI think he COULD. The issue might be his willingness to accept a certain type of role. It\u2019s tough to take away minutes from a young \u2018up and comer\u2019 for \u2018Melo right now, and risk limiting that young player\u2019s growth curve because of it. I think that might be the thought across the board (even for contending teams). Someone might look to add him for a deep playoff run later though. I LOVE \u2018Melo too, FYI!\u201d\n\nWhen I\u2019ve talked to people around the league about \u2018Melo, I got a lot of \u201che absolutely could still play in the league, he\u2019s just not a fit with us\u201d responses.\n\nStory continues\n\nNobody \u2014 not myself, not people I have talked to \u2014 question Anthony as a player. At age 35, the man can still get buckets. He\u2019s evolved into a fairly heavy isolation player because he\u2019s a difficult matchup and he was one of the best tough shot makers in the league. However, as age has eroded his skills, his efficiency has dropped and teams want him in a smaller role.\n\nAnthony is going to get another chance. Eventually. Some teams need bench scoring (or will after an injury), and Anthony should be able to provide that. Whether we will see him suit again with a contending team or not, some team will make an offer.\n\nThen we will see if Anthony is lives up to his word of accepting a role.", "description": "\u201cI think he COULD.
