He used Operation Thunder \u2013 the anti-gang operation in the Western Cape \u2013 as an example, saying it had cost R90m so far.\n\nHe said there was a shortage of 62 000 police officers for visible policing.\n\n'The shortage is a reality'\n\nThe Hawks also has a shortage of 2 800 investigators.\n\n\"With this shortage, they can never be an elite investigative unit,\" Sitole said.\n\nThere was a shortage of 8 500 officers to do normal investigations.\n\n\"This shortage is a reality. We do not expect government to address it at once,\" he said.\n\nSitole said 5 000 new recruits would join the police in December, and that he had signed off on an advertisement to recruit a further 7 000.\n\nHe had also issued an instruction for a maximum reservist call-up and the police were looking into contracting former senior investigators.\n\nOne of the trends the crime statistics have shown is that most crime happens over weekends.\n\nSitole said the problem was deployment.\n\n'Shebeens are centres of death'\n\nBecause of the shortage of officers, they were deployed to the hotspots, leaving other areas open.\n\n\"Criminals are aware of that,\" he added.\n\nOn crime over weekends, and the influence of alcohol, teetotaller Cele said: \"Shebeens are centres of death.\"\n\nCele said they were also trying to understand why the number of murders dropped annually until 2010/2011, but in 2012 \"took off like a Concorde\".\n\nAt the start of the meeting, committee chairperson Tina Joemat-Pettersson said the crime statistics released last week had been met with widespread criticism.\n\n\"I think this is a just criticism,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to see a response.\"\n\nSeveral MPs called for a \"bosberaad\" \u2013 a meeting of several government departments to address crime holistically.", "description": "Any form of a budget cut will affect the performance of the police, Police Minister Bheki Cele has told MPs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9374/0abb158f12314817a878a8f3b3c84d13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
