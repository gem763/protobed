There was no indication from the prosecutors whether a trial would be requested in this case, nor is there any certainty a judge would grant one.\n\nAccording to the document, notifying the closure of the probe, those under investigation included former UniCredit country chairman for Italy Gabriele Piccini -- today a top manager at Intesa Sanpaolo.\n\nUniCredit manager Remo Taricani, head of Sales & Marketing Retail until 2016 and today co-head of the bank's Commercial Banking Italy division, and Renato Miraglia, Unicredit's head of Investment Products in Italy until 2016, were also being probed, the document showed.\n\nLawyers for the three managers, contacted by email, did not comment.\n\nIn February prosecutors ordered the seizure of more than 700 million euros (623.5 million pounds) in assets from two diamond brokers, Italy's top lender UniCredit, Banco BPM <BAMI.MI> unit Aletti, Intesa Sanpaolo and Monte dei Paschi <BMPS.MI>.\n\nProsecutors suspect the banks of fraud and, in some cases, of money-laundering for using the proceeds of diamond sales to boost profits.\n\nOfficials from Banco BPM are also suspected of corruption because broker Intermarket Diamond Business (IDB) invested some of its profits from the diamond sales in the banks' shares, according to evidence gathered by prosecutors.\n\nAll the banks involved, with the exception of Banco BPM, started reimbursing clients by re-purchasing the diamonds at the original price.\n\nBanco BPM recognised the difference between the price paid for the diamonds and the fair value of the stones.\n\nIntesa Sanpaolo, Monte dei Paschi and Banco BPM did not comment.\n\nA spokesman for UniCredit said the lender never commented on ongoing proceedings. \"We are confident that the competent authorities will recognise the impunity of the Bank and of our colleagues,\" he said.\n\nLawyers representing the two diamond brokers did not reply to a Reuters email requesting comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Emilio Parodi, writing by Maria Pia Quaglia, editing by Stephen Jewkes and Kirsten Donovan)", "description": "Prosecutors have wrapped up a probe into alleged fraudulent diamond selling by some of Italy's top banks, having investigated high profile executives working for UniCredit  and Intesa Sanpaolo , a prosecutor document showed.
