USA TODAY\n\nIt's been quite the Saturday night for Oregon running back Cyrus Habibi-Likio.\n\nHe scored a go-ahead touchdown to give the No. 13 Ducks a 10-7 lead in the third quarter against California. Before he did that, however, he tackled a fan who ran on the field at Autzen Stadium who was trying to escape security.\n\nHabibi-Likio exited an Oregon huddle as the Ducks had gathered during the delay, ran nearly 20 yards and tackled the fan from behind. A referee and a few other Oregon players and coaches followed Habibi-Likio, but he got the fan on the ground and security took over from there.\n\nIdiot running on the field tackled by Cyrus Hanibi-Likio pic.twitter.com/7MDY2oAacc \u2014 Kevin Wade (@KwadeSays) October 6, 2019\n\nHe got big cheers from the Oregon crowd for his efforts...\n\nAnd the tackle of the game goes to Cyrus Habibi-Likio at @oregonfootball@uoregon.\n\n\n\nI mean, when a rando interrupts the game by running around the field & you're trying to play, you gotta do what you gotta do. #goducks \ud83c\udfc8\n\n\n\nalt vid: Oregon #33 tackles person evading authorities pic.twitter.com/G8dP4W97zw \u2014 Lisa Catto (@lisacatto) October 6, 2019\n\n...
