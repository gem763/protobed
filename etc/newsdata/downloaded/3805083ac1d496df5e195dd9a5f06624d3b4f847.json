Her body has never been found.\n\n\"Think of the things he did to Kayla\u2026 What he did to her was incredible,\" Trump said. \"He kept her in captivity for a long period of time; he kept her in captivity, his personal captivity. She was a beautiful woman, beautiful young woman, helped people.\n\n\"He was an animal and he was a gutless animal,\" he added.\n\n'Not forgotten'\n\nCommenting on Trump's speech, her father Carl Mueller told ABC News on Sunday that Trump's dedication of the military operation to his daughter was \"very touching\".\n\n\"President Trump mentioned her today in his statement and he mentioned that he deserved what he [al-Baghdadi] got for what he did to Kayla\u2026 She's not forgotten, and that's important.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Arizona Republic, Mueller said: \"She was held in many prisons. She was held in solitary confinement. She was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself.\n\n\"He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder.\"\n\nHer mother, Marsha Mueller, said she hopes more information will emerge about her daughter.\n\n\"I still want to know, where is Kayla and what truly happened to her and what aren't we being told?\" she said. \"Someone knows and I'm praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers.\"\n\nAt the time of her death in 2015, Mueller's parents said their daughter had devoted her career \"to helping those in need in countries around the world\", since graduating from Northern Arizona University in 2009.\n\nMueller lived and worked with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel, and the occupied Palestinian territories before returning to Arizona in 2011 and working at an HIV/AIDS clinic and a women's shelter.\n\nSensitive intelligence\n\nThe death of al-Baghdadi marks a significant foreign policy success for Trump, coming at one of the lowest points in his presidency as he is mired in impeachment proceedings.\n\nEight military helicopters flew for more than an hour over territory controlled by Russian and Syrian forces, Trump said, before landing under gunfire at a compound. Planning for the operation began two weeks ago, the president said, after the US gained unspecified intelligence on al-Baghdadi's whereabouts.\n\nNo US troops were hurt in the operation, said Trump, adding sensitive information was taken from the ISIL compound by US special forces.", "description": "President Trump says military operation that killed ISIL leader al-Baghdadi was dedicated to aid worker Kayla Mueller.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/dcd9bd06d26449b3a31e8f6800589f25_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
