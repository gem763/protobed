Escobar Inc, the self-proclaimed rightful owner of the Pablo Escobar trademark, has won a $3 million legal dispute, obtaining ownership of the PabloEscobar.com domain, TNW has learned.\n\nThe domain is currently inactive, but that won\u2019t be for long. The company plans to kick off a website by 2020, where it will sell Pablo Escobar products and merchandise, including the notorious proprietary flamethrower, the idea for which Elon Musk allegedly stole from Escobar Inc.\n\n\u201cYes [the flamethrower] will be [available], at $249 per piece,\u201d Escobar Inc COO Daniel Reitberg confirmed in an email to TNW. \u201cElon Musk will go down soon, we are preparing some huge cases against him. He will regret not paying us, just like everyone else has regretted it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all, though. The website will also offer \u201cgroundbreaking technology,\u201d according to CEO Olof Gustaffson. \u201cWe are in the process now of starting a $50 million technology company which will beat Apple Inc, easily,\u201d the young CEO told TNW. \u201cMore to follow!\u201d\n\nI, for one, can\u2019t wait to cop me some groundbreaking Pablo Escobar technology, once available.\n\nThe war on PabloEscobar.com\n\n\u201cOn August 28, 2019 Escobar Inc filed a cybersquatting claim with the National Arbitration Forum, arguing that the previous owner of PabloEscobar.com was cybersquatting [\u2026] the domain name,\u201d a press release reads. \u201cArbitration panelist Terry F. Peppard didn\u2019t question Escobar Inc\u2019s trademark claims and the domain owner didn\u2019t respond. According to the decision, the domain owner was asking $3 million for the name. The National Arbitration Forum decided to transfer the domain to the rightful owner Escobar Inc.\u201d\n\nAs far as the domain war and other potential copyright infringement debates go, Escobar Inc remains ever-vigilant to those seeking to illegally profit off of its trademark.\n\n\u201cPablo Escobar spent hundreds of millions of dollars maintaining his image. We are the only true rights holders of anything relating to Pablo Escobar,\u201d said Gustaffson. \u201cPeople need to realize this and contact us for licensing deals. Anybody that does anything relating to Pablo Escobar without our consent will be punished. We are not scared to put up a legal fight for years if that is what it takes.\u201d\n\nEscobar Gaviria seconded Gustaffson\u2019s words. \u201cI am happy,\u201d he said, speaking of the outcome of the domain battle. \u201cEscobar Inc is the only true owner of anything relating to Pablo Escobar. Infringers need to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will fight anyone that is in our way,\u201d he added, firmly.\n\nThis is hardly the first time the powerful Escobar Inc empire has delved into tech entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the past, the company launched its own cryptocurrency dubbed Diet Bitcoin. The currency \u2014 a fork of the original Bitcoin network \u2014 was available to purchase at batches of $2, $50, $100, and $1,000.\n\n\u201cEveryone should listen to these news, go to www.dietbitcoinICO.org and buy as many dietbitcoin\u2019s as you can afford,\u201d said Reitberg at the time. \u201cThe value will be very high as we are identical in numbers to Bitcoin, except we are 4,000 times cheaper right now.\u201d\n\nFor comparison, Bitcoin is currently trading at $8,542 a piece, Diet Bitcoin \u2014 $0.000093. So not that far off, depending on how bad your math is.\n\nCuriously, Escobar Inc coupled the launch of the cryptocurrency with a book of the same name, Pablo Escobar\u2019s Diet Bitcoin. In it, Escobar\u2019s brother dropped bombshell revelations, claiming that Bitcoin was created by the American government, and not the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n\u201cThe world is going to see that this was created by them,\u201d Roberto Escobar wrote. \u201cAnd when they see it, it is too late, and when CIA founds out that the world knows about this, the CIA is going to sell all of their coins, and they will destroy the value of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can stick with your worthless coins,\u201d he added. \u201cKeep the Ethereum, keep the TRON, keep the Ripple, keep the Bitcoin. You will see what happens. They will all go to zero, almost zero. But not my coin. Because my coin, this is going to be my new work in life.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope PabloEscobar.com accepts Diet Bitcoin.\n\nRead next: New gold-backed Ethereum token is guaranteed by Australian government reserves", "description": "Escobar Inc \u2014 the company of Pablo Escobar's brother \u2014 has won a $3 million lawsuit to secure PabloEscobar.com.
