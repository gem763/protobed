Whether the Kurdish fighters pull out of Ras al-Ayn will be an early test of the accord.\n\nThe Kurds were US allies in the fight against the Islamic State but came under assault after Trump ordered US troops to pull out.\n\nTrump framed the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Turkey as 'a great day for civilisation' but its effect was largely to mitigate a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Dallas on Thursday, the US president said he allowed Turkish and Kurdish forces to clash in deadly battles because the two sides were like children who needed to fight each other.\n\n'It was unconventional what I did. I said they're going to have to fight a little while,' Trump said. 'Like two kids in a lot, you have got to let them fight and then you pull them apart.\n\n'They fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious.'\n\nMore than 500 people have been killed including dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.", "description": "The city, also known as Sari Kani, has been the centre of the majority of fighting since Turkish President Erdogan invaded northeastern Syria more than a week ago.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/08/19873716-0-image-a-4_1571384257918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
