He threw an interception on his second pass. He was sacked. He sighed and said after the Miami Dolphins\u2019 59-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, \u201cI\u2019m just disappointed in myself.\u201d\n\nThe humiliation just won\u2019t stop. Bad situations keep getting worse for Rosen. In April, amid Kyler Murray euphoria, Arizona traded him one year after drafting him No. 10 overall. Then he lost the Miami starting quarterback job to journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick. If it all weren\u2019t depressing enough, after entering the Dolphins\u2019 debacle late in the third quarter, he showed why he\u2019s more project than savior at this stage of his NFL career.\n\nAll the while, Jackson joked and celebrated with his teammates. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback enjoyed an early exit after making an emphatic statement about his improvement as a passer. He completed 17 of 20 passes, threw for 324 yards and five touchdowns and posted a perfect 158.3 passer rating. He grinned and said to his old critics, \u201cNot bad for a running back.\u201d\n\nJackson, the fifth of five quarterbacks selected in the first round of the 2018 draft, is winning more (7-1 record as a starter) and seemingly growing faster than his counterparts. We\u2019re just one game into their second season, but Jackson clearly has momentum. He was the only quarterback of the five to make the playoffs last season. And last Sunday, he was the only standout performer.\n\n[Analysis: Lamar Jackson and the Ravens looked great. The Dolphins? Not so much.]\n\nBaker Mayfield, the former No. 1 overall pick, threw three interceptions as the much-hyped Cleveland Browns flopped against Tennessee. Sam Darnold, who was selected third, managed just 175 passing yards in 41 attempts, and the New York Jets lost, 17-16, to the Buffalo Bills. And while Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen (No. 7 pick) could bask in his team getting the better of his classmate\u2019s squad, Allen had two picks and registered a pedestrian 71.2 passer rating.\n\nSo the quarterback taken with the 32nd and final pick of the first round, the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner whom some teams wanted to convert to a wide receiver, is the glowing one right now. It\u2019s a wonderful story considering how easily so-called experts dismissed his pro potential and cast his 2018 success as the fleeting impact of a glorified running back. It\u2019s also a story we have come to expect in today\u2019s NFL: a fast-rising QB on a rookie deal influencing winning without occupying too much salary-cap space.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Jackson is destined to be the head of his class. If anything, the early ups and downs \u2014 and perceptions and realities \u2014 of this quarterback group serve to remind us that, while it\u2019s easier now to make an accurate quarterback judgment on a short sample size, we\u2019re still talking about extremely young players learning the most difficult position in team sports. The learning curve may not seem as dramatic anymore, but it still exists.\n\nOver the past decade, spread concepts have slipped into NFL playbooks, and coaches have been more willing to adjust their offenses to their quarterbacks\u2019 strengths. The position also is taught to youths at an advanced level much earlier. As a result, the breakthroughs have come quicker. But even the fast leaners have struggles: Cam Newton\u2019s issues with fame and consistency; Russell Wilson\u2019s fight to lead a locker room of huge personalities; Carson Wentz\u2019s injuries; Robert Griffin III\u2019s complicated descent; Andrew Luck\u2019s career-ending trauma.\n\nThe career trajectory is different, not easier. The expectation shouldn\u2019t be Dak Prescott-like efficiency from the start, and even if a young quarterback accomplishes it, he shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a finished product too soon. I\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again and again and again: Former NFL coach Mike Holmgren, a very successful QB tutor, didn\u2019t make his definitive evaluation until a quarterback had started 40 games. That\u2019s 2\u00bd seasons of information.\n\nFor the 2018 class, the players are just at the start of Year 2, and none of them started all 16 games as rookies. So there\u2019s still plenty of time. And plenty left to prove.\n\n[The AFC is worse than we thought, and more NFL Week 1 takeaways]\n\nThere seems to be something special about Jackson that goes beyond stats. During the pre-draft process, he was criticized for many silly things, including not always being expansive in his answers during interviews. Some thought that meant he lacked presence. Some went after his intelligence. But since earning the starting job in Baltimore, his smarts have been evident, and there\u2019s no doubt that he can command the locker room in his own mellow style. There\u2019s a normal-guy quality to Jackson off the field, which makes his athletic feats even more tantalizing. He\u2019s real. He\u2019s not pretending to be anybody. He knows that he\u2019s enough, and in addition to this confidence, he\u2019s putting in the work to evolve as a passer and all-around playmaker.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a novelty to Jackson that could wear off. Or by continuing to diversify his game, he just might stay ahead of the competition\u2019s bid to figure him out. That\u2019s the question with him: What happens when the NFL adjusts? The answer will arrive in his 40-game developmental period.\n\nIn a different way, Mayfield has flashed transcendent talent with his anticipation ability and audacity to make any throw. By the end of last season, he looked like the league\u2019s next great quarterback. While he committed too many turnovers in Week 1 of his second season, Mayfield shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. He will have games like that because he\u2019s so aggressive. The greater concern is that Cleveland, with its improved, star-laden roster and enormous expectations, could be putting too much on his shoulders too soon.\n\nTime will tell. No one likes to hear that, but it\u2019s true. There is only one Patrick Mahomes, and he benefitted from both Kansas City\u2019s extraordinary offensive talent and from having to sit and watch Alex Smith as a rookie. Mahomes\u2019 statistics are so outrageous that he would be a star even with regression. He is an outlier, but he\u2019s still an unfinished product at the beginning of his second season as a starter.\n\nIn today\u2019s game, the highs and lows of a young quarterback seem more telling than they once did. In reality, it\u2019s just data, just process. They all must go through it. They all must get through it.\n\nJackson didn\u2019t become a bona fide superstar Sunday. Rosen didn\u2019t become an absolute bust, either. Love what you see in Jackson; hate what you see in Rosen. Then keep looking because, even though fast-blooming quarterbacks are in style right now, old-fashioned methodical development remains essential.\n\nFor more by Jerry Brewer, visit washingtonpost.com/brewer.", "description": "Finding and properly developing a star at the NFL\u2019s most demanding position is a time-consuming process in an impatient world.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist", "September At Am", "Jerry Brewer Is A Sports Columnist At The Washington Post.
