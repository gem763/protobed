In the email, Friedman said the company doesn\u2019t have an agreement to provide professional services to ICE, and it \u201chas no visibility into how this software is being used, other than presumably for software development and version control.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo visibility\u201d into how the software will be used\n\nFriedman goes on to say that he personally, and the company generally, disagrees with Trump administration policies, like family separation and the Muslim travel ban, as does Microsoft. But he goes on to say that ICE is a \u201clarge agency\u201d tasked with duties like fighting human trafficking. He writes that, although the company doesn\u2019t know how ICE will use its tools, the members of the company leadership team \u201crecognize it could be used in projects that support policies we both agree and disagree with.\u201d\n\nFriedman says the company makes a distinction between providing professional services and offering tools. \u201cWe want software developers around the world to have the freedom to operate with a level of privacy,\u201d he writes. \u201cA world where developers in one country or every country are required to tell us what type of software they are creating would, in our view, undermine the fundamental rights of software developers.\u201d\n\nFriedman describes the $200,000 ICE contract as \u201cnot financially material\u201d and says in the email that GitHub will donate $500,000 to nonprofits that support immigrant communities affected by Trump administration policies.\n\nAfter the email was leaked, GitHub posted the full text in a blog post Wednesday morning. \u201cAt GitHub, we believe in empowering developers around the world,\u201d Friedman writes in a note. \u201cWe also believe in basic human rights and treating people with respect and dignity.\u201d\n\nProviding software to ICE has become a flashpoint in the tech industry, as employees question how their work contributions will be used by the United States government. Hundreds of GitHub coders have signed on to a petition calling on Microsoft to stop providing services to ICE or they will \u201ctake our projects elsewhere.\u201d\n\nUpdate, 10:40 AM ET: Includes blog post from GitHub with full text of the leaked email.", "description": "Microsoft-owned GitHub will renew a $200,000 contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, despite concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s policies, according to a leaked email.", "authors": ["Colin Lecher", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fy2G79EUYk_M6ulIt3ITq2xo4BM=/0x321:4836x2853/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19272329/967199944.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
