I just want my son back.\u201d\n\nFor the first few weeks after the accident, Harvey was unable to eat, drink or talk by himself.\n\nAngela said: \u201cI remember the first time he spoke to us after the accident. Nurses removed his tube and he said hello to the whole family. I broke down in tears of joy.\n\nHarvey Leyland, right, with his mother's partner, Phil. (Picture: Caters) More\n\n\u201cI thought he would start improving in other areas too, that everything would go back to normal.\n\n\u201cSo to be told that he would be paralysed for life was another blow.\u201d\n\nDespite showing slight improvements, at the start of August, Harvey\u2019s body began to reject his catheter. The area became infected and his body went into septic shock.\n\n\u201cI thought we were going to lose him,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt was the worst feeling, I was terrified.\u201d\n\nHarvey has since been moved to Southport, where he remains under observation and receives regular physiotherapy. Four weeks ago, he regained the ability to move his right index finger.\n\nIt gave the family new hope, but after further tests, doctors couldn\u2019t find any signals going to the nerves in the left side of his body or legs and believe he\u2019ll never regain the ability to move.\n\nHarvey is due to remain in hospital for the next four months until doctors are satisfied with his progress.\n\nThe family have set up a fundraising page to gather the \u00a350,000 needed to adapt their home.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know something like this was going to happen, so we haven\u2019t got the savings to make the changes,\u201d said Angela.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s only 17 and because this kind of injury is rare for someone so young, he\u2019d be in a home with older people. He needs people his own age \u2013 he needs his family around him.\u201d\n\n---Watch the latest videos from Yahoo UK---", "description": "Harvey Leyland, 17, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, was left paralysed from the neck down.", "authors": ["Ross Mcguinness"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c_saSb25rRR4aMVZwjs3WQ--~B/aD04NzE7dz0xMjQ0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8e253ae0-f401-11e9-affb-ea0631a6670d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
