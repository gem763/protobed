Why risk everything for a no-deal Brexit? Breaking up their own party, losing their parliamentary majority, dismantling the UK, trashing the economy, triggering shortages of food and medicine: how could any objective, for the Conservative and Unionist party, be worth this? What good does it do them?\n\nYes, some people will benefit. To judge by recent donations to the Conservative party, some very rich people approve of Boris Johnson\u2019s policies. A no-deal Brexit might favour hedge funds that thrive on uncertainty, financiers seeking to short the pound, vulture capitalists hoping to mop up cheap property if markets collapse. But the winners are likely to be greatly outnumbered by the losers, among whom are many powerful commercial interests.\n\nNeoliberalism promised freedom \u2013 instead it delivers stifling control | George Monbiot Read more\n\nWe make a mistake when we assume that money is the main motivation. Our unreformed, corrupt and corrupting political funding system ensures it is an important factor. But what counts above all else is ideology, as ideology successfully pursued is the means to power. You cannot exercise true power over other people unless you can shape the way they think, and shape their behaviour on the basis of that thought. The long-term interests of ideology differ from the short-term interests of politics.\n\nThis, I believe, is the key to understanding what is happening today. The Brexit ultras in government are not just Brexit ultras. They are neoliberal ultras, and Brexit is a highly effective means of promoting this failed ideology. It\u2019s the ultimate shock doctrine, using a public emergency to justify the imposition of policies that wouldn\u2019t be accepted in ordinary times. Whether they really want no deal or not, the threat of it creates the political space in which they can apply their ideas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Economist Milton Friedman, one of the fathers of neoliberalism. Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images\n\nNeoliberalism is the ideology developed by people such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is not just a set of free-market ideas, but a focused discipline, deliberately applied around the world. It treats competition as humanity\u2019s defining characteristic, sees citizens as consumers and \u201cthe market\u201d as society\u2019s organising principle. The market, it claims, sorts us into a natural hierarchy of winners and losers. Any attempt by politics to intervene disrupts the discovery of this natural order.\n\nIt was embraced by Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and most subsequent governments. They sought to implement the doctrine by cutting taxes, privatising and outsourcing public services, slashing public protections, crushing trade unions and creating markets where markets did not exist before. The doctrine was imposed by central banks, the IMF, the Maastricht treaty and the World Trade Organization. By shutting down political choice, governments and international bodies created a kind of totalitarian capitalism.\n\nIt has failed on its own terms, and in many other ways. Far from creating general prosperity, growth has been slower in the neoliberal era than it was in preceding decades, and most of its fruits have been gathered by the rich. Far from stimulating an enterprise economy, it has created a gilded age for rent-seekers. Far from eliminating bureaucracy, it has created a Kafkaesque system of mad diktats and stifling control. It has fomented ecological, social, political, economic and financial crises, culminating in the 2008 crash. Yet, perhaps because its opponents have not produced a new, compelling story of their own, it still dominates our lives.\n\nThe creation of emergency is the inevitable destination of an absolutist, failed system\n\nUnsurprisingly, people have reacted to the closure of political choice and the multiple disasters it caused. But because neoliberalism, in broad terms, was adopted not only by the right, but also by the Democrats, New Labour and similar parties, there were few places to turn. Many people responded with nationalism and nativism. The new politics that Boris Johnson\u2019s government represents incorporates both neoliberalism and the reaction to it. The glitter-eyed essentialists on the frontbenches \u2013 such as Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid \u2013 still seek to implement the ideology in its most extreme form. The opportunists, such as Johnson, Michael Gove and Priti Patel, appeal to those who seek scapegoats for the disasters it has created.\n\nJohnson uses neoliberal framing to justify his attacks on public safety. He wants to pull down environmental standards, create free ports in which businesses can avoid tax and regulation, and strike a rapid trade deal with the United States that is likely to rip up animal welfare rules and threaten the survival of the NHS.\n\nHe rages against red tape, but the real red tape is created by the international trade treaties he favours, that render democratic change almost impossible, through rules that protect capital against popular challenge, and shift decision-making away from parliaments and into unaccountable offshore courts (\u201cinvestor-state dispute settlement\u201d). This explains the enthusiasm among some on the left for Brexit: a belief that escaping from the EU means escaping from coercive trade instruments. In reality, it exposes us to something even worse, as the UK enters negotiations with the US, holding a begging bowl.\n\nUK too desperate to secure US trade deal, says Clinton's treasury secretary Read more\n\nNow, as the professor of political economy Abby Innes argues, neoliberalism has reached its Brezhnev phase: \u201cossification, self-dealing, and directionless political churn\u201d. Like Leninism, neoliberalism claims to be an infallible science. Its collision with the complexities of the real world has caused political sclerosis of the kind that characterised the decline of Soviet communism. As a result, \u201cthe only way to complete this revolution today is under cover of other projects: Brexit is ideal\u201d.\n\nThe creation of emergency is the inevitable destination of an absolutist, failed system. But emergency also provides the last means by which the failed system can be defended and extended.\n\n\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist", "description": "For neoliberal zealots, no deal represents a great opportunity to dramatically reshape Britain, says Guardian columnist George Monbiot", "authors": ["George Monbiot"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea7d7ba5f2c584b00ce8ac39e880b62a2f1f358/0_144_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ea04b247f84fc4abe82e67e0afe46bfa", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
