The men were found with similar head injuries in three sections of Chinatown early Saturday morning and pronounced dead at the scene. A fifth one survived and was hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nThe assaults left blood splattered on the doorways and sidewalks where the men had been sleeping, including The Bowery, long known as a nighttime sleeping area for homeless people.\n\nProsecutors said Rodriguez Santos was shown video of the assaults during an interrogation and acknowledged he was the person in the video. He did not enter a plea at his arraignment Sunday and was ordered held without bail.\n\nPolice responded to a 911 call just before 2 a.m. as one assault was in progress. They found one man dead in the street and a second with critical head injuries.\n\nNew York Police Department officers investigate the scene of an attack in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood, Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019 in New York. More\n\nTwo witnesses told officers they saw a man wearing black pants and a black jacket repeatedly hitting one of the victims in the head with a metal object, Assistant Chief Stephen Hughes said.\n\nAfter a search, officers apprehended Rodriguez Santos, who fit that description and was carrying a metal bar that prosecutors said was covered in blood and hair.\n\nPolice said he has undergone a psychiatric evaluation. Rodriguez Santos has been arrested at least six other times in the past two years, three times on assault charges.\n\nSeeking a 'better world': Kindness fever strikes Los Angeles, from homeless singer Emily Zamourka to a new UCLA institute\n\nHis mother, Fioraliza Rodriguez, told the Daily News her son had become such a menace, hitting her and his grandfather, that she kicked him out of the house more than three years ago.\n\nRelatives told the newspaper that Rodriguez Santos started using drugs upon arriving in New York from his native Dominican Republic four years ago, then became violent and stole from the family.\n\nStill, his mother didn\u2019t expect his violence to escalate to this extent.\n\n\u201cI never thought he would kill someone,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid of him, though, because he punched me. That\u2019s when I told him to get out of my house.\u201d\n\nPolice have not released information on the victims other than to say one of them was an 83-year-old man.\n\nMichael Baldassano, chief of Manhattan South detectives, said there\u2019s no clear reason for the killing rampage.\n\n\u201cThe motive appears to be, right now, just random attacks,\u201d Baldassano said, adding there was no evidence yet that the victims were \u201ctargeted by race, age, anything of that nature.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: New York City homeless killings: Man charged with murder", "description": "A homeless man has been charged with murder in the brutal killings of four other homeless men in New York City's Chinatown neighborhood.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
