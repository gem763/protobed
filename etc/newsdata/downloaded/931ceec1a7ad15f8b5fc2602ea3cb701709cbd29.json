What is CrowdStrike, and why did Trump bring it up?\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House released a partial transcript of the call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asked the Ukrainian president to look into potential 2020 political opponent Joe Biden and his ties to a company in Ukraine. But earlier in the call, Trump begins to ramble about CrowdStrike, a US cybersecurity company.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said, according to the partial transcript. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrowdStrike is mentioned several times in the Mueller Report, as the company was responsible for examining the hack of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email servers. The forensic work carried out by CrowdStrike ultimately identified Russia as the culprit for this hack and led to indictments of 12 Russian nationals.\n\n\n\nThough it is not immediately clear what Trump is talking about in the transcript, he appears to be referencing a persistent right-wing conspiracy theory that the CrowdStrike investigation of the 2016 DNC hack was part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to blame Russia for election manipulation.\n\n\n\nConservatives have sought to portray CrowdStrike, which is based in Silicon Valley, as unreliable and part of a conspiracy against Trump. CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and went public in June 2019 after raising $280m in venture capital.\n\n\n\nAt the root of this theory is the claim the DNC did not give the FBI \u201cthe server\u201d that was hacked, and somehow that server ended up in Ukraine. In reality, there was not one server but more than 140 servers decommissioned by the DNC following the Russia hack. The subsequent investigation concluded it had sufficient information to determine Russian interference.\n\n\n\nStill, Trump has tweeted a number of times about the alleged \u201cmissing server\u201d since taking office, often mentioning it alongside Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cmissing emails.\u201d\n\n\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ....Where is the DNC Server, and why didn\u2019t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?\n\nPeople who subscribe to this conspiracy believe CrowdStrike is owned by a Ukrainian national. In 2017, Trump told the Associated Press CrowdStrike is owned by a \u201cvery rich Ukrainian\u201d. Officials at CrowdStrike are reportedly very confused about Trump\u2019s references to the company.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI,\u201d Crowdstrike said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAs we\u2019ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US intelligence committee.\u201d\n\n", "description": "President gives rambling press conference as controversy swirls", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh", "Joan E Greve", "Kari Paul", "Vivian Ho", "David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54767f2944e5d2a8c5ab9ccc7d1daa24fa3e0e27/117_11_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5cfb1823ec451b725d3986070e606456"}
