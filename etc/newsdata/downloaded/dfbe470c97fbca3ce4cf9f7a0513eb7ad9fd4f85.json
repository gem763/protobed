They have only conceded four tries in the whole tournament, with two of them being against the All Blacks in their first game.\n\n\u201cThey are a tough nut to crack, and they are pretty determined as well. Given what England did to New Zealand, they will be favourites in terms of the way they played, but it is going to be difficult.\u201d\n\nEngland\u00b4s triumphant 2003 World Cup squad returned home as heroes (PA)\n\nIf England conquer the rugby world this weekend, similar scenes to 2003 can be expected such as a London victory parade and Downing Street reception.\n\n\u201cThey will have achieved something very, very special that is very hard to do,\u201d Dallaglio added.\n\n\u201cI remember from my own experiences, you celebrate it with the country \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing achievement and everyone feels very proud.\n\n\u201cIf you can start your season by winning the World Cup, then the possibilities are endless after that.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Land Rover is Official Worldwide Partner of Rugby World Cup 2019.
