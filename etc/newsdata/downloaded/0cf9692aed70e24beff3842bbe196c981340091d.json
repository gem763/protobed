Thank you for everything, it was a blast.\u201d\n\nTop seed at Flushing Meadows, former world number one Osaka struggled with a knee problem before being upset by 13th seed Belinda Bencic in straight sets in the fourth round.\n\nIt continued a difficult season for the power hitter since her second Grand Slam title at Melbourne Park, with early exits at the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nThe Australian Open win made her Asia\u2019s first world number one and the first player of any nation to claim the first two Grand Slam titles back-to-back since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.\n\nHowever, the top ranking and the attention that goes with it proved a heavy burden, she admitted, after a tearful first round exit from the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships in February.\n\nAustralian Ash Barty later took the number one spot in the leadup to Wimbledon where Osaka crashed out of the first round, saying the fun had gone out of her game.\n\nAs Barty faltered during the North American hardcourt season, Osaka reclaimed the top ranking in the leadup to the U.S. Open despite tepid form in Cincinnati and Toronto.\n\nHer early exit from New York has seen her ranking slide to four behind world number one Barty, Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina.", "description": "Twice Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka has sacked her second coach in seven months, splitting with Jermaine Jenkins in the wake of her disappointing U.S. Open title defense.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429253506&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C023-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
