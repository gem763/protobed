Here's where to try", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Remember when you were a kid and you could eat whatever you wanted? Well, here's what Americans choose to eat, according to a new Carvel study. Buzz60\n\nSquare boxes for round pizzas have never entirely made sense, and Pizza Hut has finally set out to fix that.\n\nThe company announced Tuesday that its new round boxes will be tested at one location in Phoenix for a limited time starting Wednesday. And the new box isn't the only innovation.\n\nThe pizza served in the round boxes, Garden Specialty Pizza, will be topped with Incogmeato Italian sausage. Incogmeato, a collaboration between Pizza Hut and Kellogg, is a plant-based meat substitute that caters to Pizza Hut's vegetarian customers.\n\nBoth the pizza and boxes will be available in store only while supplies last.\n\nMeatless Monday and beyond: These restaurants have vegan and plant-based options\n\nPickup or delivery?: Uber Eats launches delivery alternative with new pickup feature\n\nPizza Hut's new round box\n\nAfter two years of design and test work, the round pizza box is finally ready for its debut. Pizza Hut will serve hot pizzas in the round box at one location only: 3602 E. Thomas Road in Phoenix.\n\nFans of the Hut can get their hands on a round box starting at 11 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe round box was designed to keep pizzas safe during delivery, with less room to slide around. The two sections also interlock for easier sealing.\n\nPizza Hut's new Garden Specialty Pizza is served in a new, compostable round box.
