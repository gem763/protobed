Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a 2020 presidential contender, recited the 23rd Psalm. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who also grew up in Baltimore, gave remarks, along with former senator and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former congressman and NAACP leader Kwesi Mfume (D-Md.). Former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were scheduled later in the lengthy program.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHillary Clinton called Cummings, a native son of Baltimore, \u201cOur Elijah,\u201d and thanked his family, his \u201cpolitical family\u201d and constituents of Maryland\u2019s 7th District for sharing him \u201cwith our country and the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the prophet, our Elijah could call down fire from heaven. But he also prayed and worked for healing,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cLike the prophet, he stood against the corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\u201d\n\nThe people in the packed pews clapped and cheered.\n\nCummings was \u201ca fierce champion of truth, justice and kindness ... who pushed back against the abuse of power,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cHe had little tolerance for those who put party ahead of country or partisanship ahead of truth.\u201d\n\nA schedule showed that each speaker was allotted about five minutes at the podium \u2014 a time limit that several quickly ignored.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMourners began lining up at the church at 5 a.m., the Baltimore Sun reported. By 7 a.m., traffic was backed up a half-mile away from the church, which seats nearly 4,000. A choir sang and clapped as mourners filed into the concert hall-like sanctuary.\n\nA pastor read Bible passages through the public address system, and one of the white-gloved ushers recited the words along with him, from memory. Clips of Cummings speaking in Congress played on huge video screens above the open casket, which was surrounded by massive sprays of flowers.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, what do we do to make sure we keep our democracy intact?\u201d he said in one video.\n\nCummings, who had been in poor health in recent years, died Oct. 17 at age 68. As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Cummings, he played a leading role in investigating the Trump administration. He often said he considered it his mission to preserve the American system of government as the nation faced a \u201ccritical crossroads.\u201d\n\nBut Cummings, the son of sharecroppers, was also a lifelong civil rights champion known for his efforts to help the poor and the struggling, and to boost the fortunes of his struggling hometown.\n\nJust after 10 a.m., mourners at New Psalmist sprang to their feet and waved their hands as the Clintons and former vice president Joe Biden, also a 2020 candidate, walked in. The cheers grew louder when Obama followed, taking his place next to Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the congressman\u2019s widow, in the front row. Together, they sang along to the opening hymn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs gospel singer BeBe Winas performed, a woman near the back wiped her eyes with a handkerchief. He sang: \u201cTell me, what do you do when you\u2019ve done all you can / And it seems, it seems you can\u2019t make it through / Well you stand, you stand, you just stand.\u201d\n\nThe crowd obeyed.\n\nCummings was honored Wednesday at Morgan State University in Baltimore, a historically black research university where he served on the board of regents.\n\nOn Thursday, he became the first African American lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol, a rare honor reserved for the nation\u2019s most distinguished citizens. Congressional leaders held a memorial ceremony for their former colleague at the Capitol\u2019s ornate Statuary Hall, after which the coffin, was draped in an American flag, was escorted to a spot just outside the House chamber. Thousands of members of the public came to pay their respects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor more than two hours, Rockeymoore Cummings, personally greeted the mourners, shaking hands, sharing hugs and engaging in extended conversations. A former gubernatorial candidate who chairs the Maryland Democratic Party, she is considered one of the potential contenders for her late husband\u2019s seat.\n\nRockeymoore Cummings greeted the last mourner at 7:39 p.m. Minutes later, a motorcade escorted Cummings\u2019s body out of Capitol Plaza for the final time.\n\nAD", "description": "Thousands gathered at Baltimore church to mourn longtime civil rights leader Rep.
