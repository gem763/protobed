A miserable club whose membership count is believed to be two.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d says Chris Chandler, the only other starting NFL QB known to have been sidelined by mononucleosis, \u201cis a legit, hardcore illness.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDarnold was diagnosed with it on Wednesday, and immediately quarantined in his apartment. He had, according to Jets head coach Adam Gase, already lost five pounds. He had missed practice Wednesday with what Gase originally called strep throat.\n\nBut this \u2013 mono, as it\u2019s commonly called \u2013 is worse. Much worse.\n\nJust ask Chandler, who spoke to Yahoo Sports Thursday from his home in Utah. He contracted the virus midway through a 17-year NFL career, late in the 1995 season.\n\nFollowing a 42-33 Houston Oilers win over the Denver Broncos, in which he threw for 280 yards and three touchdowns, \u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling real good,\u201d he remembers.\n\nThen came the sore throat. The tiredness. The weakness. The following week, the Oilers went to Pittsburgh. \u201cI didn\u2019t warm up at all,\u201d Chandler recalls. \u201cI actually threw a touchdown pass in the first [half]. And then I went back in the locker room, and I just fell asleep.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget walking off that field in Pittsburgh,\u201d he continues. \u201cI literally went back to the locker room, on a concrete floor, laid on my back with a towel behind my head, and just fell asleep until the game was over.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nChandler tried to go again the following week, back at home against Detroit. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have played,\u201d he now admits. He again lasted until halftime, but was replaced by rookie Steve McNair. For two or three weeks thereafter, he did \u201cnothing.\u201d His season, in Week 15, was over.\n\nChandler still has no idea how he got mono. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure exactly what mono is,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a tough thing to deal with.\u201d\n\nWhat is mono? And why can\u2019t NFL players play with it?\n\nMono, in short, is a virus transmitted via saliva that can cause fatigue, fevers, swelling and other unsavory symptoms that generally make life wretched.\n\nAnother potential symptom is an enlarged spleen. That\u2019s why football players can\u2019t simply fight through mono to take the field. The spleen\u2019s enlargement puts it at risk of rupturing \u2013 and puts the players, therefore, at risk of serious injury, or even death.\n\nVery few NFLers have publicly been diagnosed with it. Some, however, understand Darnold\u2019s plight. Former 49ers offensive lineman Jonathan Martin missed OTAs with the illness in 2014. Recently retired defensive end Chris Long was diagnosed with it back in college, and says he lost 20 pounds.\n\n\u201cMISERABLE,\u201d Long wrote on Twitter Thursday. \u201cCouldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nAl Groh was like \u201chey he looks good can we get him back out here?\u201d Trainer was like \u201cif he gets hit his spleen he could die.\u201d So anyone claiming to die for this pic.twitter.com/vVO8BMChpY \u2014 Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) September 12, 2019\n\nOther college football players diagnosed with mono had similar experiences.\n\nWhen Michigan State cornerback Darian Hicks fell ill a few weeks before the opening game of his junior season, he initially assumed he just had a bad sore throat. Only after he woke up one morning with his tonsils inflamed and swollen did he realize it was something worse.\n\n\"It's kind of a surreal feeling because you hear about mono but you never think that you're going to get it,\" Hicks told Yahoo Sports.\n\nFor the next couple weeks, Hicks recalls constantly feeling sluggish. He lost 12 pounds because he couldn't eat or drink anything without his body clenching up.\n\nOnce Hicks was finally cleared to play after fall camp was over, he struggled to regain the muscle he\u2019d lost. Even so, he persevered, regaining his starting job by midseason, producing a career-best 33 tackles, and helping Michigan State advance to the 2015 College Football Playoff.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t let that stop me from making an impact,\u201d Hicks says. \"It forced something new out of me. It was a blessing in a curse.\"\n\nStill, mono is both a draining affliction and a rare one. Darnold\u2019s is just the second known case among NFL starting QBs.\n\n\u2018This thing will grab you by the throat and throw you down\u2019\n\n\u201cThe virus,\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic, \u201chas an incubation period of approximately four to six weeks.\u201d That jibes with Gase\u2019s words Thursday. Darnold, the Jets coach said, will be out indefinitely. With New York on bye in Week 4, Week 5 appears to be the earliest possible return date.\n\nIn the meantime, Darnold won\u2019t be able to do much more than ride mono out. Rest. Hydrate. And wait.\n\nSam Darnold and the New York Jets lost to the Bills in Week 1. (Getty)\n\nChandler recalls the commonplace football urge to battle through. To shrug off the symptoms. To play despite them.\n\n\u201cI would assume he probably said, \u2018I can do it, I\u2019m fine,\u2019 \u201d the former Pro Bowler says of Darnold. \u201cBut this thing will just grab you by the throat and throw you down on the ground and say, \u2018No, you\u2019re not playing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe first phase of symptoms, Chandler remembers, were \u201cnot necessarily a flu, but you kind of have some body aches, and you just don\u2019t feel great.\n\n\u201cThen, all of a sudden, you can\u2019t even stay awake. When it hits you, there\u2019s no possibility of [playing]. You\u2019re, like, \u2018Down goes Frazier.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nYahoo Sports features writer Jeff Eisenberg contributed to this story.\n\nHenry Bushnell is a features writer for Yahoo Sports.
