It kept the interest rate steady. The move took traders by surprise as the authorities usually inject liquidity when previously offered loans come due, and the next batch won\u2019t mature until Nov. 5.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been under pressure amid a prolonged trade dispute with the U.S. and a slowing domestic economy, prompting the central bank to ease monetary policy by lowering corporate borrowing costs and cutting banks\u2019 reserve ratios this year.
