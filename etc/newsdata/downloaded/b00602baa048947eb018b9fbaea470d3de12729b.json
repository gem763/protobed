Last year, local authorities removed a statue of the British explorer from Gisborne after it was repeatedly vandalised with graffiti.\n\nSimilar protests have also occurred in neighbouring Australia, where Captain Cook also landed. Australia's government is also commemorating his voyage next year.\n\nMany Aboriginal groups have spoken out against those plans, and the celebration of Australia Day, which marks the anniversary of British settlement. Some critics have dubbed it \"invasion day\".\n\n\"Nobody is denying that Cook arrived,\" said Ms Herbert-Graves. \"What we're saying is why commemorate Cook to lead on the story? You wouldn't commemorate Adolf Hitler's contribution to modern motorways in order to tell the story of Jewish endurance.\"\n\nImage copyright LEIGH HENNINGHAM Image caption A Captain Cook statute was vandalised in Australia last year ahead of its national day\n\nNew Zealand currently provides all people, including M\u0101oris, with legal protections from discrimination based on race.\n\nSeven parliamentary seats are reserved exclusively for M\u0101ori MPs to ensure a basic level of representation in government. Nearly a quarter of the legislative body is currently comprised of M\u0101ori MPs.\n\nThe government has also taken measures to preserve indigenous culture. M\u0101ori is recognised as one of the country's official languages, and a publicly-funded M\u0101ori language TV station was established in 2008.\n\nBut voter turnout amongst M\u0101oris is consistently low, and the community has a disproportionately high rate of unemployment and incarceration.\n\nSeveral M\u0101ori groups also continue to campaign for rights over historic land and fisheries.\n\n'The don't really care about us'\n\nCanada is another country that continues to grapple with its treatment of indigenous people and the impact this has had on national identity.\n\nEarlier this year, a landmark government inquiry concluded that Canada was complicit in a \"race-based genocide\" against indigenous women.\n\nImage copyright Handout Image caption Political and environmental activist Joseph Fisher argues that Canada was \"founded on racism\"\n\nAnother government commission ruled in 2015 that Canada had committed \"cultural genocide\" by separating some 150,000 indigenous children from their families and forcing them to live in state-run schools. More than 3,000 children died while living in these schools, while others suffered physical, emotional or sexual abuse.\n\nJoe Fisher, whose father lived in one such school, told the BBC that celebrating Canada Day - the country's national holiday - was \"a slap in the face to anybody who's not a white settler\".\n\n\"Canada was founded on racism, and not just to my community,\" said Mr Fisher, a political and environmental activist in British Columbia.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm not proud to live here,\" he added, \"but to say I'm proud of being a Canadian, it's almost equal to saying I'm proud to be a member of the Klu Klux Klan.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"The nun rubbed my face in my own urine\"\n\nOver 10 years ago, Canada voted against a United Nations declaration guaranteeing certain protections to indigenous people around the world, including the right to exist.\n\nBut last year, a bill to apply the UN declaration into Canadian law passed the country's lower house, and is due to be voted on in the Senate.\n\nMr Fisher says that thanks to activism, education reform and media coverage, attitudes are changing in Canada as more people become aware of indigenous history.\n\nHe believes that other steps should be taken, like ending the exploitation of historically indigenous lands for natural resources.\n\nHowever Mr Fisher remains sceptical that the government will push through any meaningful changes to improve living conditions and opportunities for indigenous people.\n\n\"I don't think they really care about us or they wouldn't do what they have done and what they continue to do,\" he said.\n\n'It has rewritten history'\n\nIn other countries, like South Africa, governments have replaced old national celebrations in an attempt to strength ties between indigenous people and more recent communities.\n\nFor over 40 years, Founders Day was celebrated in South Africa every 6 April to mark the anniversary of Dutch settlement in the country.\n\nBut the holiday was abolished in 1994 after South Africa held its first election for voters of all races. The day of those elections, 27 April, is now celebrated as Freedom Day.\n\nImage caption Dr Thabo Makgoba is a patron of South Africa Day\n\nCritics argue that its abolition is an attempt to erase the country's early history and make white South Africans feel unwelcome.\n\nSupporters, meanwhile, say that Founders Day commemorated an era of rampant inequality among South Africans.\n\nFor Cape Town's Archbishop, Dr Thabo Makgoba, it was constant, institutionalised reminder that he was treated differently for being black.\n\n\"Founders Day was merely for me an entrenchment of being less than human,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBut Dr Thabo added that he recognised the power of such occasions.\n\n\"If Founders Day was so powerful that it enabled the government to have policies and laws that made racism legitimate, I believe that a day when we celebrate the opposite of that can have the same input,\" said the archbishop.\n\nAmong his other roles, Dr Thabo is a patron of South Africa Day. The initiative aims to boost economic equality and national pride among all races, and to regenerate areas of the country through voluntary community work.\n\nIt also encourages community events on South Africa Day itself (the last Saturday of November), and is working towards the construction of new schools and community centres.\n\n\"The main thing is to change the attitude,\" said Dr Thabo. \"Both black and white need to come to the table and say: 'What has been hurtful about our past, what is hurtful now, and how do we shape the future together?'\"", "description": "Controversy over a ship in New Zealand shows how tensions remain over national identity.", "authors": ["Joshua Cheetham", "Frances Mao", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E60E/production/_108849885_gettyimages-145208691-594x594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
