The front-month November contract was at $64.96 a barrel, up 56 cents, by 0212 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 66 cents to $58.79 a barrel, set to post a 7.1% gain for the week, the largest weekly rise since June.\n\n\"The forward curve remains 'bid' as traders are hedging that the initial estimates for the duration of repairs (at damaged Saudi facilities), given the complex nature, could well underestimate the time required,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nSaudi Arabia's production dropped by almost half after an attack on Saturday crippled a major oil processing facility.
