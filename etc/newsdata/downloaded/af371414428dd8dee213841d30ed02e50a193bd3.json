Nor can he stop thinking about his encounter with a fleeing jaguar a few nights before.\n\n\u201cIt was running for its life,\u201d said the firefighter captain, peering out from under his yellow hard hat. \u201cIt was in a state of sheer terror.\u201d\n\nThe jaguar is a feared but rarely sighted inhabitant of the Chiquitano dry forest, the unique ecosystem sandwiched between the Amazon and the Gran Chaco that has borne the brunt of weeks of fires in eastern Bolivia. At least 1.2m hectares (3m acres) have been destroyed.\n\nAll the volunteer firefighters report seeing terrified and burned animals: pacas, wild pigs, armadillos, tapirs and many bird species. On one occasion a rattlesnake climbed up Calla\u00fa\u2019s leg before he kicked it away. \u201cI caught my breath and realised it thought my leg was a tree,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just trying to get away.\u201d\n\nThousands of fires swept through eastern Bolivia in August, to the fury of environmentalists and locals who accused the country\u2019s president, Evo Morales, of incentivising the blazes after he passed legislation in July that encourages slash-and-burn farming to create pasture and arable land. Morales, who is running for a controversial fourth term of office, has refused to rescind the decree. His government says high winds and dry conditions are to blame for the worst fires in living memory.\n\nPlay Video 1:01 Armadillos and tapirs among wildlife caught in Bolivia\u2019s fires \u2013 video\n\nTears rolled freely down Andr\u00e9s Manac\u00e1\u2019s begrimed face as he was embraced by colleagues and applauded by municipal workers in San Ignacio\u2019s town square. He had returned with other firefighter volunteers after eight days battling the flames.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very hard experience because the fire nearly trapped me twice,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cThe first thing I thought of was my family, but thank God I\u2019m here now.\u201d\n\nManac\u00e1 and 14 other firefighters were dropped from helicopters into the forest more than 60 miles (100km) from the town, but soon found themselves fleeing flames that spread upward into the canopy so fast they created a fire whirl.\n\n\u201cIt was violent, like lightning\u201d, he said. \u201cIt felt like we were working to defend nature.\u201d The unprecedented destruction of wildlife was also hard to stomach. Even following strict safety protocols, the men struggled psychologically, Manac\u00e1\u2019s fire chief, Luis Andr\u00e9s Roca, said.\n\n\u201cThe stench of burned flesh was unbearable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nesting season and when the trees caught light the parrots died in their nests. My companions and I would cry, we felt so powerless. It\u2019s the worst tragedy we\u2019ve ever seen here.\u201d\n\nGlobal opprobrium has been focused on Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, over the record number of fires raging in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest tropical forest. Morales, Bolivia\u2019s leftwing leader, is now facing similar anger.\n\nThe self-proclaimed defender of Pachamama, or Mother Earth, is accused of employing the same populist policies as his Brazilian counterpart. The fires were mainly started by small farmers who used the recent legislation to open up new land to farming and cattle, his critics say.\n\nIn La Chiquitan\u00eda, a boundless region of savannah and forest, August is the month of high winds when farmers typically carry out chaqueo, the practice of burning to clear land. But never like this, said Hern\u00e1n Ramos, 76, who has lived all his life in Las Taperas, a village on its eastern edge.\n\n\u201cThere used to be just small fires, they were controlled, not like now,\u201d he said, pacing downcast over the blackened, ash-flecked earth. \u201cThese fires have surged in a way that there was no way to control.\u201d\n\nThe Chiquitano dry forest is the ecosystem which connects South America\u2019s two largest biomes, the Amazon and the Gran Chaco, a dense dry forest of thorn-covered trees and scrub that extends south into Paraguay and Brazil.\n\nWith tall, papery-barked, often leafless trees, copious underbrush and daytime temperatures rthat reach up to 45C, few places in the world appear more flammable. It would only take a spark to set it ablaze.\n\nOn a three-day trip through the territory renowned for its Jesuit churches dating back to the 17th century, the Guardian saw a desolate panorama of scorched forests stretching for mile after mile.\n\nBased on satellite images from Bolivia\u2019s early warning fire detection agency, environmental groups estimate the destruction has surpassed 2m hectares. About 16% of the damage is within protected areas and fires recently spread into Kaa-Iya, Bolivia\u2019s largest national park in the Gran Chaco.\n\nIndigenous Chiquitano communities lost up to 98% of the forest they were working sustainably for timber and products such as copaiba oil, said Mar\u00eda del Carmen Carreras of WWF Bolivia.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Soldiers take a break from fighting fires in the Chiquitano dry forest. Photograph: Juan Karita/AP\n\nMany locals blame migrant farmers moving from Bolivia\u2019s highlands to the tropical lowlands for spreading the fires because they don\u2019t know how to control them.\n\nStanding across from a wooden colonial-era church painted with frescoes, San Ignacio de Velasco\u2019s mayor, Moises Salc\u00e9s, held up his hand as he named the culprit of the disaster. \u201cThe [human] hand,\u201d he said, shaking his head wearily. \u201cThe cause is 99% indiscriminate slashing and burning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just set the prairie alight. You have to pile up the wood and brush and cut it off with stones before,\u201d said Arnoldo \u201cChichi\u201d Vaca, a wiry driver for tourists visiting the area\u2019s Jesuit churches. \u201cThese are outsiders who started these fires.\u201d\n\nThat perception has stoked existing racial tensions between cambas \u2013 Bolivians from the eastern lowlands \u2013 and migrant collas \u2013 mostly indigenous people from Morales\u2019s heartland in the western highlands, who are often looking to carve out a plot of land to farm.\n\nRoly Aguilera, the secretary general of the eastern state of Santa Cruz, said the fires had spread because there were illegal settlements in the forest that \u201chave been promoted politically by the central government\u201d.\n\nWhen Morales visited the town of Concepci\u00f3n on Friday, he was assailed outside the town hall by orange-clad firefighters who demanded to know why he had not visited them to thank them. Insults where exchanged between his supporters and detractors who shouted: \u201cEvo, murderer of nature.\u201d His office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMorales has allowed in soldiers, planes and helicopters from mostly neighbouring countries to combat the fires, and last week he ordered that no agribusiness could be established on the burnt land. On Friday, he accused unspecified groups of paying people to to start the fires.\n\nBolivia: catastrophic wildfires devastate forest in echo of Brazil's Amazon crisis Read more\n\nSuch tensions were laid bare when protesters interrupted an event marking Bolivia\u2019s first beef export to China last week in San Ignacio. Local media reported that as Morales sealed the first container of 96 tonnes of beef, demonstrators had chanted: \u201cBehind every fallen tree there\u2019s a laughing cattle rancher.\u201d\n\nThere was no laughter on the frontlines of the battle, where volunteer firefighters worked by night to keep cooler and better see the embers. \u201cAgua!\u201d went up a shout as beams from volunteers\u2019 head-lamps illuminated the swirling smoke and ash hanging in the air.\n\nJust half an hour outside La Concepci\u00f3n, the fire had consumed nearly everything. Twigs had become ash that could be brushed away like the tip of a cigarette left in an ashtray. A charred log pulsated white hot inside. The smell of wood smoke hang heavy and the ground was hot underfoot.\n\nDozens of volunteer firefighters who had come from cities across Bolivia complained they had received little support from the government.\n\n\u201cReignition fire is a major problem, that\u2019s why we have to be so thorough,\u201d said Junior Tejada, a volunteer who had come with his brigade from Cochabamba. Like many others, he expressed rising anger at Morales\u2019s slowness to act, and a growing sense of suspicion that the president shared some responsibility with the firestarters.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing to Bolivia and the Amazon is something that can\u2019t be fixed even if we put out the fire now,\u201d said Olivia Mansilla, an architect who took time off her job in Santa Cruz to volunteer. \u201cWhat comes next will be a holocaust for nature.\u201d", "description": "Furious locals say president is culpable over unprecedented destruction of wildlife", "authors": ["Dan Collyns"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41ec090c0a0ffba4aaa31fece8e970a17a089dd3/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3775dba065f248b37d3847596d97d377"}
