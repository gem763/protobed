About half of the normally stable country\u2019s 16 regions remained under an emergency decree and some were subject to a military curfew, the first since Chile returned to democracy in 1990, barring natural disasters.\n\nRiot police used teargas and water cannon on Tuesday to break up marches by rock-throwing demonstrators in several parts of the capital, Santiago, while soldiers and police guarded Chileans who formed long lines at supermarkets.\n\nCarmen Fuentealba, who is retired, said: \u201cI\u2019ve walked several kilometres searching for milk, but the supermarkets remain closed and neighbourhood stores have run out.\u201d\n\nMany stores, subway stations and banks were burned, damaged or looted during protests over the weekend.\n\nPi\u00f1era, a billionaire and former airline owner, said earlier this week that Chile was \u201cat war with a powerful, relentless enemy\u201d, but switched to a more conciliatory tone after he was widely rebuked.\n\nHe met members of his administration and three of the six main opposition leaders on Tuesday to explore a \u201csocial agreement\u201d on solving \u201cthe problems that affect Chileans\u201d.\n\nHours later, Pi\u00f1era called for increasing the lowest monthly pensions from $151 (\u00a3118) to $181, raising the monthly minimum wage from $413 to $481, and rescinding a 92% rise in electricity rates scheduled to take effect next month. The proposals also included a tax increase for anyone earning more than $11,000 a month.\n\nUnrest began last week when a rise in subway fares led to students jumping over station turnstiles in protest. But the defiance exploded into violence on Friday, with demonstrators setting fire to subway stations, buses and a high-rise building.\n\nDemonstrations then escalated to include demands for improvements in education, healthcare and wages, and spread nationwide, fuelled by frustration among many Chileans, who feel they have not shared in the country\u2019s economic progress.\n\nShortly before the rioting broke out last week, the conservative Pi\u00f1era told the Financial Times that Chile \u201clooks like an oasis\u201d in the region because it has a stable democracy and a balanced and growing economy that has been creating jobs and improving pay.\n\nBut wealth is unevenly spread and Chile has one of the region\u2019s highest rates of inequality. Many Chilean families earn between $550 and $700 a month.", "description": "Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era announces plans after riot police use teargas to disperse protesters", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87427d497a34a888e89e79018ee9da2c781811f3/0_166_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06c9c7f548788b4b76e9a2cac450189e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
