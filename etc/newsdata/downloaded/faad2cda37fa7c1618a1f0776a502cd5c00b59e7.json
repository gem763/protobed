Photo: Courtesy of Chris Black.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most powerful hair dryer or the handiest chef\u2019s knife, those things can be easy enough to find. Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) is here to help in the form of a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nWhat do you recommend for wall art? My girlfriend and I just moved into a new apartment and we haven\u2019t hung anything yet \u2014 so total blank canvas. I was leaning toward a tastefully framed David Hockney print for the living room but was unsure if that would be in poor taste.\n\nWe love a print; I have a few in my living room. Go for it, use Framebridge (or read the Strategist\u2019s guide to online framing) to float that bad boy, and show your guests that you have great taste in aging British pop artists.\n\nDavid Hockney Sun From the Weather Series Poster $468 (was $550, now 15% off) This one would be perfect. And while it\u2019s true that there has been a surplus of Hockney in the Zeitgeist lately, the classics never go out of style. $468 at Amazon Buy $468 at Amazon Buy\n\n\"Google search: monet,\" by Hannah Dean Saatchi Art organizes things by price, style, and subject, which is easy but also feels a little strange. Regardless, it\u2019s an excellent place to browse. With a quick search, I found this painting I like a lot from Hannah Dean. $615 at Saatchi Art Buy\n\n\"Untitled (Red Roof)\" by Matt McCormick Tappan Collective is similar to Saatchi, with a cooler, millennial-friendly website. It has a good selection, especially if you wear a lot of earth tones, live in Silverlake, and love the farmers\u2019 market. All roasting aside, you can get originals from people like Matt McCormick, whose photo-realistic paintings, like this one, are getting a lot of attention right now. Probably a good investment. $1,600 at Tappan Collective Buy\n\n\"Robert Smith of The Cure photographed in London, 1985\" by Peter Anderson If you like photography, Sonic Editions is the best bet. Iconic images, multiple sizes, very affordable. I have a perfectly goth small photo of Robert Smith in my office. Dark, I know. (Full disclosure, I work with this brand.) From $139 at Sonic Editions Buy\n\nWe all gotta start somewhere \u2014 in a few years, you might be calling Zwirner himself to put in an offer on that Anni Albers you have your eye on!\n\nEager to know what your choice of luggage is for travel. Have my eyes on something from Rimowa, but are there any (possibly cheaper) alternatives that you\u2019d recommend?\n\nRIMOWA Essential Cabin Small 22-Inch Packing Case First off, I am a vocal Rimowa supporter; it\u2019s worth the investment. It\u2019s well designed and eternally chic. If you need a reliable carry-on, the Essential Cabin 22-inch in matte black is perfect (it can fit in the overhead compartment and hold a lot more than you think thanks to the flex-divider system) and has an excellent warranty. Trust me. $670 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nMuji Adjustable Handle Hard Carry Suitcase 87L But if you aren\u2019t willing to plunk down, I can only suggest Muji. A lot of my friends use the Hard Carry Bag. It\u2019s (obviously) much cheaper than Rimowa, but also doesn\u2019t look like a knockoff like some other new brands out there. $260 at Muji Buy\n\nThe North Face Base Camp 150L Duffel If you don\u2019t need to roll, this XXL North Face is perfect. I like this safety-yellow version; it has backpack straps (I would never!) and is weather-resistant. Get in line to climb Mount Everest or head to Amagansett: Either way, you are covered. $185 at Backcountry Buy\n\nWhat outwear are you feeling for fall/winter?\n\nTemperatures are dropping; it\u2019s time to really start dressing. We are going to start simple and then go full turbo. Please stick with me. We got options, baby!\n\nMontbell Thermawrap Classic Jacket Montbell is an excellent alternative to classic Patagonia or North Face puffer. The branding\u2019s light, it\u2019s well priced, and it\u2019s surprisingly still under the radar. I have never even been camping, but some of my more outdoorsy friends put me onto this. $189 at Montbell Buy\n\nUniqlo Men's Blocktech Single-Breasted Coat $80 (was $99, now 19% off) I love a simple water-repellent mackintosh jacket. It looks chic and keeps you dry all the way down to your knees. Navy is a no-brainer, and it\u2019s from Uniqlo, so the price is right. $80 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nStone Island Garment Dyed Zip Overshirt These overshirts from Stone Island are perfect for chilly fall nights. The garment-dye treatment makes it look nice and worn in, not super-tech, bruv. $375 at End Clothing Buy\n\nCeline Mac Coat in Houndstooth The final boss of the season is this beautiful houndstooth number from Celine. I can\u2019t find a more perfect coat on the internet. It\u2019s going to be hard to pull off unless your band is opening for the Rolling Stones and you are dating Alexa Chung, but give it a try. $3,450 at Celine Buy\n\nAnd if you\u2019re just looking for some basics, might we suggest this Chris Black Starter Pack \u2014 his favorite white T-shirt, jeans, sneakers, socks, gym shorts, etc.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
