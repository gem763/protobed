He has been paying a \u00a365 premium ever since.\n\nHe assumed a cardiac arrest and heart attack meant the same thing - but the company rejected his claim for a \u00a390,000 payout saying it is not on the list of conditions covered.\n\nIn a further twist his friend Jason Morris, a financial adviser, discovered Aviva changed it's critical illness policy to include cardiac arrest in 2009. They say the new terms and conditions didn't apply to existing customers.\n\n\"I don't know when I'll be able to go back to work,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Birmingham Post and Mail)\n\n\"My wife Sue is worried, I've got three kids but I thought 'at least we're covered' and then it turns out we're not.\n\n\"What did I pay all that money for? I can't drink, I can't play sport, I've got to take tablets for the rest of my life - it's pretty critical.\n\n\"It's a genuine claim.\"\n\nHe added: \"I know a lot of people will get technical, But when you're a 30-year-old guy and you buy the policy and they say 'we'll send you a booklet', you don't know what you're going to get.\"\n\nAn Aviva spokesperson said: \u201cWe sympathise with customers experiencing significant health issues and look to pay as many claims as possible.\n\n\"Mr Norcross and his financial adviser notified us that Mr Norcross has suffered a cardiac arrest and they were informed that this particular condition is unfortunately not covered by the terms of his contract.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\u201cCritical illness insurance is designed to cover a defined set of medical conditions, which are clearly stated at the outset of the insurance policy, and policy premiums are priced to meet a claim against these specific conditions, and not others.\n\n\"Although medical conditions included in a critical illness policy can change over time to reflect advances in medical care, it does not necessarily follow that a newer policy will provide more extensive cover overall.\n\n\"To be fair to all of our customers, we need to assess claims consistently and against the contract that the customer has.\n\n\u201cIt is important that customers review their protection insurance periodically alongside their financial adviser, particularly if cover was arranged some time ago, to decide whether a new policy would be more appropriate and to be reminded of the conditions they are covered for.\u201d", "description": "They knocked back Lee Norcross' claim but anyone who signed up to the same policy after 2009 will be covered", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Men Media", "Manchester Evening News", "Birmingham Post", "Mail", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470992.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS194915914.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
