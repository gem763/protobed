The 74,000-square-foot Brooklyn store has more than 60,000 products, including an extensive restaurant-quality prepared foods department and more than 4,000 organic products. The also has a hot food bar.\n\nIn going to Brooklyn, Wegmans is entering a region that is ripe for the coveted millennial demographic, one that rival Whole Foods has done well within the New York City market.\n\nThe idea of convenience is one that studies have shown has appeals to millennials. Since this demographic values organic and fresh, the addition of Wegmans enters a market tailor-made to embrace these offerings.\n\n\u201cIt will certainly have an effect on the supermarkets that are nearby. Most New Yorkers either walk to their supermarkets or have their groceries delivered so it is hyper local,\u201d Lempert said.\n\n\u201cI believe that their delivery business will be huge - much larger share than is traditional for grocers.\u201d\n\nWegmans is a big deal to its loyal customers. A Harris Poll earlier this year had them listed as the top reputation for any brand, regardless of industry. For three years since 2018, it was named the top supermarket in a poll by Market Force.", "description": "Popular grocery store Wegmans is getting ready for a New York City debut, which one industry analyst thinks could shake up the market.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/Wegmans.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
