All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.\n\nA protester wears tear gas canisters on his fingers Credit: Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images More\n\nAn eyewitness said hundreds of protesters were in the encampment when live bullets were fired toward them from a passing car. Then, masked gunmen in black plainclothes arrived and started shooting at the protesters, the witness said, speaking on condition of anonymity, fearing for his safety. Tents caught fire, igniting a blaze, he added.\n\nKarbala, as Baghdad and other cities in Iraq's southern region, has been gripped by a wave of deadly anti-government protests which have often turned violence, with security forces shooting at the protesters and protesters setting fire to government buildings and headquarters of Iran-backed militias.\n\nThe demonstrations are fueled by anger at corruption, economic stagnation and poor public services. Despite its vast oil wealth, Iraq suffers from high unemployment and crumbling infrastructure, with frequent power outages that force many to rely on private generators.\n\nThe protests have grown and demonstrators are now calling for sweeping changes, not just the government's resignation. Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi has promised a government reshuffle and a reform package, which the demonstrators have already rejected.\n\nBurning tyres light up the night skies Credit: Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images More", "description": "Iraqi security forces wearing masks and black plainclothes opened fire at protesters in the Shiite holy city of Karbala on Tuesday, killing 18 people and wounding hundreds, security officials said, in one of the deadliest single attacks since the country was engulfed by protests this month.
