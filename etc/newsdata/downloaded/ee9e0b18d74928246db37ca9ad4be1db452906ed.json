Optimism also rages on because China\u2019s economy does in fact continue to grow, allowing big multinationals such as Starbucks and Apple to benefit from the rise in worker incomes and overall living standards.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy has been slowing for years now, so it\u2019s a managed slowdown,\u201d Global X ETFs head of research and strategy Jay Jacobs said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cThe First Trade.\u201d \u201cI think the bigger risk is that there is a hard landing in China, an unexpected drop in output. I just think that is something that is very unlikely given the government\u2019s control over the economy and the consistency of that growth.\u201d\n\nThat said, ask any trader five years ago if 6% GDP growth from an emerging market such as China would be completely ignored, and the answer would be \u201chell no.\u201d\n\nBut alas, that disregarding of China\u2019s years-long slowdown persists following the latest mixed read on the country\u2019s economy. China\u2019s economic growth fell to its lowest level in about three decades, per new government statistics out Friday. China\u2019s GDP grew by 6% in the third quarter. Analysts were looking for 6.1% growth.\n\nChina\u2019s GDP gained 6.2% in the second quarter. Stocks barely reacted on the latest news.\n\n\u201cGrowth is lower, and I think it will be lower for a while given what\u2019s going on with the trade tariffs,\u201d AdvisorShares founder and CEO Noah Hamman said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about it. I think most investors are invested domestically. And with the Fed increasing its balance sheet, you will see a rise in the stock market again.\u201d\n\nAnd if pros like Hamman and Jacobs are correct, stocks will continue to overlook China\u2019s growth cool-down.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
