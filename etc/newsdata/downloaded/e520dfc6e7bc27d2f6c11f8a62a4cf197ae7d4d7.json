The video was shown during a political conference and few people actually saw it. Thanks to social media, though, millions of others saw it.\n\nFast forward to this weekend. It is as though the left and anti-Trump forces are hypocrites or something. The violence wished upon President Trump from them is right in front of us. Taking a page from the Kathy Griffin book of political activism, singer/actress and devoted hater of Trump, Barbra Streisand, tweeted out a gruesome drawing of President Trump impaled by a Louboutin stiletto heel \u2013 an expensive shoe brand instantly recognizable for its red soles. (a.k.a. red bottoms.) Pelosi is lettered on the shoe\u2019s heel. It was Streisand\u2019s homage to Pelosi\u2019s infamous temper tantrum during her last face-to-face meeting with the president and congressional leaders.\n\nStreisand also tweeted out a drawing from a New York Magazine article advocating for Trump\u2019s impeachment. The drawing is a giant peach (get it?) squashing Trump. A little too on the nose, but the message is clear.\n\nOne may argue about a narrow or broad impeachment resolution but Trump has committed multiple impeachable acts. https://t.co/jABlGwWuH4 \u2014 Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) October 19, 2019\n\nPerhaps Ms. Streisand will receive a visit from the Secret Service as Kathy Griffin did. That impalement image is a lot stronger and more violent than the standard lame drawings of Trump from his opponents.\n\nThe second example from this weekend\u2019s Trump Derangement Syndrome watch comes from a small athletic wear company based in Portland, Oregon, Dhvani. They sell $58 yoga pants, among other clothing items. The company paid for a thirty-foot billboard in Times Square depicting Trump being hogtied in front of the White House by an angry woman in athletic wear. The model playing Trump is a former Marine, now a middle school teacher. I wonder what he\u2019ll have to say to his students about this.\n\nThe billboard featuring a model binding a Trump look-alike with red, white and blue rope while stomping on his face, was put up as part of an advertising campaign by Dhvani, a Portland-based clothing company. https://t.co/XnKeFxAubV \u2014 WBRC FOX6 News (@WBRCnews) October 19, 2019\n\nAnother image was tweeted out of the Trump model being gagged, surrounded by five women models. Dhvani is taking aim at the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to block federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The president needs a gag order, you see. Marketing experts are split in their opinions of the effectiveness of this ad, though they all agree that this is \u201cthe most extreme example of politically charged advertising to date.\u201d Dhvani has a goal of \u201ccreating change in the world.\u201d\n\nThe idea began with \u201ca lightning bolt of inspiration\u201d over the summer, Dhvani\u2019s chief executive, Avi Brown, said in an interview Friday with The Post. The billboard shows a Trump impersonator being tied up by model Michal Mesa, a Marine Corps veteran and middle school teacher. Symbolism figures heavily in the photo, Brown said. The red, white and blue rope was inspired by Wonder Woman\u2019s \u201ctruth lasso,\u201d while the looming storm \u201crepresents the inevitable and supernatural power of justice.\u201d The impersonator\u2019s face, he said, is pixelated, though that is not obvious in photographs. \u201cWe certainly know who it evokes, but it\u2019s not that person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a metaphorical statement.\u201d The marketing campaign, which was photographed in August, also includes images of a Trump impersonator being bound, gagged and shushed. In one photo, a model is holding his phone while he is sitting on a golden toilet, pants pulled down around his ankles. In another, a woman is pulling a piece of duct tape over his mouth. \u201cThis is about giving a voice to women,\u201d said Brown, 46, who founded the company last year. \u201cOur intent is for our brand to stand for progressive change in the face of what we perceive to be steps backward in the evolution of our country.\u201d\n\nWell, Avi Brown may want to use his little clothing company to advance his political ideology but he eliminates about half of his potential buyers by doing so. Perhaps after the response that his company\u2019s tweets have received, he\u2019ll get a clearer picture of retail consumerism. Brown is \u201cfed up\u201d and supports impeachment. This campaign was created in August, by the way, and therefore ahead of the dumb video\u2019s release at that conservative political conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never taken a political stand before but frankly, we were fed up,\u201d Brown said, adding he was inspired by Nike\u2019s advertising campaign with Colin Kaepernick \u2014 the former NFL quarterback who sparked a movement by his refusal to stand during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality. \u201cThis is just saying: Let\u2019s put a gag order on him. Enough is enough. We support impeachment.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s standard rhetoric from the authoritarian left these days. If someone vocalizes a different political opinion, that person must be dehumanized and told to shut up. In this case, a model playing President Trump is literally being gagged. Their protest of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cgag rule\u201d prohibiting doctors at Planned Parenthood Title X-funded clinics from referring patients for abortions also morphs into a cry for impeachment. Mr. Brown said he is \u201crebranding Dhvani as an \u201cActiv(ist)Wear\u201d company and will donate a portion of its proceeds to nonprofits that provide health care to women.\u201d Planned Parenthood, however, doesn\u2019t want Brown\u2019s money. At least not from this violent campaign.\n\n\u201cOur staff members have faced threats and acts of violence for doing their jobs, and many of our patients turn to us as their safe space for care after facing violence in their lives,\u201d Melanie Newman, senior vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. \u201cWe do not condone violence or violent imagery against anyone.\u201d\n\nEven Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t want to stand with this garbage advertising campaign.", "description": "Double standard", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/445e5018-3126-4ead-81ae-e685ad50f7b4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
