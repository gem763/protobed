They both have terrific form.\n\nThe paperback version of Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning bestseller The Goldfinch ran to 864 pages, so it's no great surprise that the film adaptation, starring Nicole Kidman and Ansel Elgort (right), weighs in at a hefty two-and-a-half hours\n\nBut The Goldfinch, while not short of virtues, is ultimately an exercise in pretty laboured storytelling.\n\nOddly, however, the ending seems rushed and out of kilter with everything that has gone before.\n\nA complex and sensitive biographical tale, comprising all kinds of psychological twists and turns, abruptly morphs into a Euro-trashy thriller, yielding a denouement that wouldn't have looked out of place in an old episode of The Persuaders!\n\nMaybe it doesn't help that I never read the book.\n\nOn the other hand, those who have might be even more underwhelmed.\n\nEither way, the story stems from a tragedy, a terrorist bombing at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which kills the mother of Theodore Decker (played as a boy by Oakes Fegley, and as an adult by Ansel Elgort).\n\nThe Goldfinch, while not short of virtues, is ultimately an exercise in pretty laboured storytelling\n\nIn the explosion, a famous 17th-century painting of a goldfinch is ripped from its frame.\n\nTheo hides it in his rucksack and keeps it as his secret from the world, a kind of sentimental link with his beloved dead mother.\n\nHis feckless father Larry (Luke Wilson) has long since scarpered out West, so a traumatised Theo is taken in by the Barbours, a starchy Upper East Side family of considerable wealth.\n\nAs warmly as her prim Waspiness will allow \u2014 which is to say, not very \u2014 the mother (Nicole Kidman) takes a shine to Theo.\n\nMeanwhile, he also builds a relationship with a kindly antiques dealer called Hobie (Jeffrey Wright), through a connection made in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\nI was probably alone, but I couldn't help drawing a parallel with another antiques dealer \u2014 that nice Mr Gruber, who helps Paddington the immigrant bear get over his feelings of dislocation.\n\nTheo is just beginning to feel more snug in the Barbours' chilly embrace, and bonding with Hobie's ward, a girl called Pippa (Aimee Laurence as young Pippa then Ashleigh Cummings) who was also injured in the explosion, when his father shows up from Las Vegas with a boorish girlfriend, 'Xandra with an X', played by Sarah Paulson.\n\nIt's abundantly clear to us, if not to anyone in the film, that Larry and Xandra are interested in Theo only because they think he might be worth a few bucks.\n\nThe ending of The Goldfinch seems rushed and out of kilter with everything that has gone before\n\nSo further disorientation is forced on the poor lad, when he is dragged off to live in a godforsaken suburb of Vegas.\n\nStill, he at least makes a friend there, a Ukrainian kid called Boris (Finn Wolfhard/Aneurin Barnard), who introduces him to shoplifting and drugs.\n\nAre you keeping up, those of you who haven't read Tartt's novel?\n\nIt's complicated, to say the least. I dare say Straughan has trimmed the narrative considerably, but that just has the effect of making some characters seem jarringly superficial, while the Vegas section of the story feels overlong.\n\nIt's a relief when Theo gets back to New York, though perhaps not as big a relief as when the credits finally roll.\n\nAll this unfolds over two time periods, switching between Theo's adolescence and his 20s.\n\nIt's nicely acted, with Kidman, as usual, nicking all the scenes she's in, and stylishly shot by veteran British cinematographer Roger Deakins.\n\nBut The Goldfinch has flopped disastrously in the U.S., and I can't see the UK box-office offering much to chirrup about.\n\nReady Or Not (18)\n\nVerdict: On the whole, not...\n\nRating:\n\nReady Or Not also starts with a childhood event, before picking up the story 30 years later.\n\nIt's a gruesome comedy-horror film set in a creepy American mansion belonging to the wildly dysfunctional Le Domas family.\n\nThink the Addams family, only less appealing.\n\nReady Or Not, which stars Samara Weaving, is a gruesome comedy-horror film set in a creepy American mansion belonging to the wildly dysfunctional Le Domas family\n\nThey are heirs to a fortune built on the production of playing cards and board games, hence (though I don't suppose it's a 'hence' that the Waddingtons, say, would endorse) their deadly tradition whenever someone marries into the family.\n\nThe newcomer is forced to play a game at midnight on their wedding day, and if the game turns out to be Hide-and-Seek, their new in-laws will hunt them down and kill them.\n\nThe target in this case is Grace (Samara Weaving), freshly married to Alex (Adam Brody).\n\nHer mother-in-law Becky, the Morticia Addams of the set-up, is played by Andie MacDowell, so perhaps we can summarise Ready Or Not as a warped version of her most famous movie outing: One Wedding And Loads Of Funerals.\n\nIt's played more for chuckles than scares, and there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but seeing a young woman being hunted and subjected even to comedic brutality feels bang out of tune with the times.\n\nRambo: Last Blood (18)\n\nVerdict: Violent and offensive\n\nRating:\n\nWhat has five letters, begins with R, is played by Sylvester Stallone and is still fighting (even though old Sly is now 73)?\n\nWell, it can't be Rocky, as he had the good sense to hang up his gloves.\n\nNo, it's Stallone's other alpha-male alter ego, troubled Vietnam veteran John Rambo, in what we are told will be his valedictory orgy of brutal vengeance.\n\nIn Rambo Last Blood, a tale co-written by Sylvester Stallone, the old soldier is at least having a stab at a peaceful retirement and giving beloved niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) a huge knife to remember him by at college. Sweet\n\nLet's hope so, as the original film, First Blood, came out in 1982 and 37 years is quite enough of this carnage.\n\nHere, in Rambo Last Blood, a tale co-written by Stallone, the old soldier is at least having a stab at a peaceful retirement and giving beloved niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal) a huge knife to remember him by at college. Sweet.\n\nBut then Gabrielle decides to whizz down Mexico way where a friend has located her feckless father.\n\nThere, she is drugged and sold into sex slavery, so naturally Rambo, jaw set like concrete, thunders off to find her.\n\nDonald Trump will love this movie, which implies every man in Mexico is either a pimp or a brigand.\n\nIt also uses the appalling degradation of a young woman to trigger our hero's trademark, vein-bulging battle against evil, despatching brainless thugs using his killing technique, the Rambo dimbo combo.\n\nIt's silly, offensive and extremely violent, but with a certain style and swagger, if you like this sort of thing.\n\nStory of Motown will have you dancing in the street\n\nHitsville: The Making of Motown (12A)\n\nVerdict: Simply unmissable\n\nRating:\n\nGreat music, like great cinema, is truly life-enhancing. This documentary, which next Monday is showing for one night only on 300 screens across the UK, followed by a limited run, offers us a memorable double-whammy of both.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t especially love Motown, I defy you not to emerge with a spring in your step and a song in your heart. Make that 50 songs, from the likes of Diana Ross and the Supremes and Marvin Gaye.\n\nThe backbone to the film is the joyful rapport between Smokey Robinson, now pushing 80, and Berry Gordy Jnr, Motown\u2019s effervescently charismatic founder (both pictured below), who is now pushing 90 and only announced his retirement this week, as they reminisce about the old days.\n\nThe backbone to the film is the joyful rapport between Smokey Robinson (left), now pushing 80, and Berry Gordy Jnr (right), Motown\u2019s effervescently charismatic founder, who is now pushing 90 and only announced his retirement this week, as they reminisce about the old days\n\nFrom the start, Motown was like a family \u2014 and in more ways than one (Marvin Gaye married Gordy\u2019s sister; Gordy had an affair with Diana Ross).\n\nLike any family, it was riven with jealousies, resentments and feuds, but the purpose of this documentary is not to tell us what went wrong, more to tell us what went triumphantly right.\n\nIn that sense it is almost like a promotional film, from which Gordy emerges as the most visionary and benign of bosses.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t, always. But never mind that. Some clips are worth the admission price alone, such as that of the 11-year old Stevie Wonder, flooring everyone with his precocious genius, and the even younger Michael Jackson, whose guileless energy you will watch with a pang of sorrow for what he became.\n\nThere\u2019s much more of that, and some fascinating recollections from stars such as Martha Reeves (who was the office secretary, before filling in behind the microphone one day and belting out Dancing In The Street).\n\nIt\u2019s compelling stuff from start to finish, so gather your friends and go to see it on Monday.\n\nSay you\u2019ve been told it\u2019s wonderful. Tell them you heard it through the grapevine.\n\nMarked man who really shed his skin\n\nSkin (15)\n\nVerdict: Blemished, but worthwhile\n\nRating:\n\nJamie Bell gives a pulsating performance in Skin as an American neo-Nazi who renounces all notions of white supremacy, to the vengeful fury of his former associates.\n\nThe film, set in Columbus, Ohio, about ten years ago, is based on the true story of Bryon Widner, whose creed of race hate, which involved torching mosques and beating up African-Americans, was depicted by swastikas and other ghastly tattoos all over his face and neck.\n\nAs he came to realise the error of his ways, he had painful laser-treatment to remove them, hence the film\u2019s title.\n\nJamie Bell gives a pulsating performance in Skin as an American neo-Nazi who renounces all notions of white supremacy, to the vengeful fury of his former associates\n\nWritten and directed by Guy Nattiv, an Israeli, Skin is at least as tough to watch as American History X, the 1998 movie in which Edward Norton played a character on exactly the same trajectory, from hate and violence towards peace and reconciliation.\n\nBut as an exercise in filmmaking, it is not as accomplished.\n\nThe narrative is muddled at times. Nevertheless, Skin is worth seeing, both for Bell\u2019s excellence and a similarly compelling performance by Danielle Macdonald, very different from her breakout turn in the 2017 charmer Patti Cake$, as Julie, the young mother of three he falls for.\n\nTomorrow (15)\n\nVerdict: Nothing to look forward to\n\nRating:\n\nTomorrow is an independent British film telling a perfectly good story, of Tesla, a paralysed ex-soldier, back home in London trying to hold together a new relationship and build a prospective career as a chef, while also combatting post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAnother former soldier, James Blunt, graces the soundtrack.\n\nSebastian Street is fine as Tesla, with Stuart Brennan playing his friend, Sky, who has a health issue of his own to deal with.\n\nTomorrow is an independent British film telling a perfectly good story, of Tesla, a paralysed ex-soldier, back home in London trying to hold together a new relationship and build a prospective career as a chef, while also combatting post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nThe pair also wrote the screenplay; and the film, which has a curious cameo from Stephen Fry as a health visitor, marks the directorial debut of Martha Pinson.\n\nShe has worked as a script supervisor for Martin Scorsese, which explains his credit as executive producer.\n\nBut the great man must have raised those celebrated bushy eyebrows at some of the clunkier acting and dialogue.", "description": "The paperback version of Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning bestseller The Goldfinch ran to 864 pages, so it's no great surprise that the film adaptation weighs in at a hefty two-and-a-half hours.", "authors": ["Brian Viner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/19/18978332-0-image-a-12_1569522464526.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
