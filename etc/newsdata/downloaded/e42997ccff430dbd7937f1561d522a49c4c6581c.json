It can then be ratified by either a parliament vote or presidential degree.\n\nIn Australia the views within the union movement are patchy, but where there are concerns they are passionate.\n\nOn Thursday, ACTU president Michele O'Neil said Labor had \"made a mistake that will not be forgotten by Australian workers\", the CFMMEU warned it would worsen relations between unions and Labor, while the Electrical Trades Union will move a motion at this weekend's ALP conference in the Northern Territory that would require the party to expel Labor MPs if they abandon its platform to protect jobs in free trade agreements.\n\nJob opportunities\n\nIt would require MPs to ensure FTAs provide job opportunities to local workers while ensuring foreign workers are not exploited and to protect wages and conditions, trades, qualifications, safety and sovereignty.\n\nThe NT conference is the first of the ALP conferences at state, territory and national levels that unions are threatening to disrupt following outrage against the parliamentary party for backing the free trade deals.\n\nUnions argue they will facilitate the entry of foreign workers and leave the federal government prone to legal action from abroad via Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clauses.\n\nHowever, Labor MPs argued in caucus that the party's opposition to trade deals with Investor-State Dispute Settlement and labour mobility clauses, which is enshrined in the party platform, only applied if Labor was in government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nETU National Secretary Allen Hicks said the Indonesian FTA \"could lead to an explosion in dodgy electrical work and wage theft''.\n\n\"There is no process for testing the licensing and training of electrical workers entering Australia under this type of agreement,\u201d Mr Hicks said.\n\n\u201cIf Labor wants to push more working class voters into the arms of Pauline Hanson it\u2019s going about it the right way.\u201d\n\nNet benefit to nation\n\nSenator Birmingham said there were already laws requiring holiday workers and other foreign workers to have the appropriate qualifications before undertaking skilled labour.\n\nMr Albanese has outlined his concerns to Mr Birmingham in a letter. He wants an assurance Australian jobs will be protected and the abolition of a 1993 bilateral investment agreement with Jakarta which had an ISDS clause with no safeguards.\n\nThe new FTA has several safeguards and carve-outs applying to the ISDS clauses but these would be meaningless if the 1993 investment agreement still exists.\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said the agreements were of net benefit to workers and the nation as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Indonesia set to move from the world\u2019s 16th largest economy to the ninth largest in 2030, and fourth largest in 2050, it was a market that needed to be tapped.\n\n\"Despite its proximity to us and its impressive growth record, Indonesia represents just 2 per cent of Australia\u2019s trade,'' he said.\n\n\"We should be doing better, and investing more in this important relationship, particularly now.\"", "description": "Anthony Albanese has sought to quell union unrest over Labor's support for free trade agreements by telling supporters \"these aren't the deals we would have done if we were in government''.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2047%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ce73bd911442ca619fbf15aca97b871f23d8e88f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
