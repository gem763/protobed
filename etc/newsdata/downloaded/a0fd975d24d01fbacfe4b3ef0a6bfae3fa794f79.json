In two of the games \u2014 Notre Dame and Louisville \u2014 the Cavaliers led at halftime before fading in the second half. In all three games, adding a 17-9 loss at Miami to the mix, they lost the turnover battle by a combined 8-1.\n\n\u201cIn each of those games, there has been a successful drive by our opponent,\u201d Mendenhall said, speaking of late-in-the-game situations. \u201cSo as strong as we are statistically, there is one more drive that we need to get stopped per game for us to win the Coastal.\u201d\n\nIt would also help if they stop stopping themselves by ending their own drives prematurely.\n\nQuarterback Bryce Perkins accounted for all five of Virginia\u2019s turnovers in the 35-20 loss at Notre Dame with two interceptions and three fumbles, including one that was returned 23 yards for a touchdown. Another was returned 48 yards to set up a 7-yard touchdown drive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning it over at too high a level in our losses and not taking it away at a high enough level,\u201d Mendenhall said.\n\nPerkins also threw an interception in the 28-21 loss at Louisville and has nine touchdowns and eight interceptions on the season. Virginia is lacking a dominant running game this season, the offensive line has struggled with protection at times and teams are more in tune with what Perkins can do with his feet. The QB said his tendency to try to do too much at times \u201cdefinitely showed up\u201d when reviewing film of the losses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job of just being smarter about not trying to always be superman and make the superman plays,\u201d he said.\n\nPerkins\u2019 three fumbles against the Fighting Irish all came on sacks, and after he tweaked a preseason knee injury against Louisville, the coaching staff backed off on calling running plays for him. Still, he and Mendenhall agreed, there were times he abandoned the pocket before giving the called play a chance.\n\n\u201cJust watching it, there\u2019s definitely sometimes where I escape early,\u201d he said, perhaps because he feared getting his knee injured further.\n\nThe Cavaliers spent much of their fall camp preparing for their season opener on a road at Pittsburgh, a team they lost to in each of Mendenhall\u2019s first three seasons as coach. The losses away from home since have left them looking for ways to get back to the mindset they had in their 30-14 victory at Pittsburgh .\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got to take one more step you know, as far as everything: the focus, the execution, the soundness of our team,\u201d Perkins said.\n\nLinebacker Noah Taylor said that work started once the Louisville game was over.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we\u2019d lost because of our own mistakes and our missed assignments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the game we were worried about UNC and worried about what we can do next week, because we still have a season ahead of us. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the end-all, be-all.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mendenhall said his team needs to improve in two areas to win the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division: turnovers and late-game situations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hank Kurz Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/28/Virginia_Louisville_Football_09764.jpg-e0019_c0-0-3673-2142_s1200x700.jpg?1b581f36add9c0fd373102f87e7c2d08df532db7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
