At the time, I wrote that this gave Microsoft a perfect opportunity to produce the ideal Surface Pro: a computer that\u2019s thin, light, always connected via built-in LTE, and has tremendous battery life. Microsoft has released several new Surface computers since then, including models with built-in LTE, but it has yet to produce one powered by an ARM chip instead of Intel\u2019s more power-hungry processors.\n\nThat\u2019s where Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Book 2 comes in. The $999 Galaxy Book 2 is essentially the same kind of machine as Microsoft\u2019s popular Surface Pro: a tablet with a detachable keyboard and pen that runs the full Windows 10 experience. But the Book 2 is also one of the new Always Connected PCs that are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 processor.\n\nOn paper, the Book 2 is the Surface Pro I\u2019ve been looking for: an always-connected, ultraportable computer that will last more than a full day away from an outlet. But, as is often the case, what\u2019s on paper doesn\u2019t always line up with reality.\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy Book 2 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Thin and light design\n\nLong battery life\n\nIntegrated LTE\n\nKeyboard and pen are included Bad Stuff Windows 10 on ARM still has program compatibility issues\n\n4GB of RAM is limiting\n\nThe processor isn\u2019t powerful enough for demanding work\n\nTo the untrained eye, the Galaxy Book 2 is virtually indistinguishable from Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro. It\u2019s a thin tablet with a built-in, infinitely adjustable kickstand, a keyboard that magnetically attaches to the bottom, and a pressure-sensitive pen for writing and drawing. The Book 2 is roughly the same dimensions as the Surface Pro, right down to its 1.75-pound weight (without a keyboard).\n\nOne thing that is different is the display: the Book 2 has a 12-inch, 3:2 OLED touchscreen (with Samsung\u2019s Super AMOLED branding) that\u2019s pixel-dense and color-rich. It also gets bright enough to use the tablet outdoors. The screen is a little smaller than the Surface Pro\u2019s, but I didn\u2019t notice the size difference as much as I noticed the giant bezels that surround it, which are considerably larger than the Pro\u2019s already big bezels.\n\nOther differences can be found on the sides, where the Book 2 has two USB-C ports, either of which can be used to charge the computer, and a fingerprint scanner in the upper right corner behind the screen. I prefer a face-recognition camera over a fingerprint scanner for logging in to a laptop, but it is fast and reliable.\n\nSamsung has equipped the Book 2 with side-firing AKG-tuned speakers that sound rather thin and flat. They work well for conference calls, but using them while watching video or listening to music isn\u2019t very pleasant.\n\nIncluded in the box is a full-sized keyboard with backlit keys and a large trackpad. It\u2019s a nice keyboard that\u2019s easy to type on, but its plasticky finish is nowhere near as nice as the Alcantara keyboards that are available for the Surface Pro. However, Microsoft doesn\u2019t include its keyboard in the box, which costs an additional $159 on top of the price of the Surface.\n\nThe same can be said for the Book 2\u2019s included S Pen stylus: it\u2019s a perfectly functional, pressure-sensitive stylus, complete with an eraser on the back, that\u2019s not quite as nice as Microsoft\u2019s $99 Surface Pen, but Samsung includes it in the box.\n\nOverall, the Book 2\u2019s hardware is best described as competent: there are no major flaws or glaring issues, but the fit and finish of the materials are a step or two below what Microsoft offers. Given the price differences between the devices (an LTE-equipped Surface Pro with a pen and keyboard will run many hundreds of dollars more), most of this can be excused in favor of the Book 2.\n\nInside, things are a bit different. As I noted, the Galaxy Book 2 eschews the traditional Intel processor options for a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850, a modified version of the Snapdragon 845 found in many smartphones, that\u2019s specifically designed for Windows computers. It\u2019s paired with a scant 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. (There are no other options or spec levels to choose from with the Book 2.)\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book 2 Specs 12-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 pixel OLED touchscreen\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 850 processor\n\n4GB of RAM\n\n128GB of storage\n\n8-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel front camera\n\n2 USB-C ports, microSD card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack\n\n11.32-inches x 7.89-inches x 0.30-inches\n\n1.75lbs (without keyboard)\n\nWindows 10 Home (in S Mode)\n\nAvailable from Microsoft, Samsung, AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint\n\n$999\n\nThe Book 2 is one of the first devices to hit shelves with the 850, and it\u2019s the first one I\u2019ve used. My initial experience with the prior generation Snapdragon 835-powered Always Connected PCs was less than positive: I ran into a number of app compatibility issues, and the performance was sluggish and frustrating.\n\nUnfortunately, while the 850 is improved over the prior-gen chip, it still suffers from many of the same issues. The Galaxy Book 2 ships with Windows 10 in S Mode, which limits the apps you can install to what\u2019s in the Microsoft Store by default. But even then, I ran into several utilities I couldn\u2019t use because they aren\u2019t compatible with the ARM platform. Other apps that I could install, such as LastPass, wouldn\u2019t run and just crashed on launch.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t take long to find the performance limits of the Book 2. While it can certainly work fine for light, casual work, as soon as I try to juggle multiple tasks and flip between a browser with a dozen or so tabs open, email, Slack, Word, and other productivity apps, the Book 2 starts to buckle under the pressure. Performance in Slack is so laggy and frustrating that I ended up ditching the desktop app and using a browser tab to access it.\n\nThe Book 2 will also hang and stutter when switching between virtual desktops or even when just trying to open the start menu and perform a search in Cortana. I\u2019m guessing the 4GB of RAM is a big limitation here \u2014 even Samsung\u2019s own Galaxy Note 9 smartphone has more RAM on board \u2014 but it\u2019s also likely due to the processor just getting overloaded.\n\nOn the plus side, the Book 2 is silent because it has no fans, and it stays cool, even when I\u2019m juggling a lot of tasks. And its battery life is great: while it doesn\u2019t hit the 20 hours that Samsung claims, I am able to use it all day at work and on my commute home without having to plug it in. I\u2019ve never used an Intel ultraportable PC with this much battery stamina.\n\nAll of this makes the Samsung Galaxy Book 2 rather frustrating. It has a great, super portable form factor, long battery life, and built-in LTE, which should make it a great computer for road warriors. But then it\u2019s hampered by its processor platform and lack of RAM, which make it hard to work efficiently on. Those who only have to do a handful of tasks for their work might not have an issue with the Book 2\u2019s performance, but anyone that juggles a lot of web browsing with other productivity apps will likely hit the Book 2\u2019s wall rather quickly.\n\nSamsung may have come the closest to making my dream computer, but the Book 2 just doesn\u2019t have enough of the pro I need to be my everyday computer.", "description": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Book 2 is a 2-in-1 convertible tablet and laptop powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 850 processor.
