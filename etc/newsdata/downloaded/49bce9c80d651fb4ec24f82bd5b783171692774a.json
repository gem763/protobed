During that call, Trump discussed American aid to Ukraine while pressuring Zelensky to find a server supposedly related to hacking of the Democratic National Convention during the 2016 presidential election, and asking him to investigate the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call,\u201d the report states. \u201cThey told me that there was already a \u2018discussion ongoing\u2019 with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials' retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.\u201d\n\nBut as the complaint makes clear, this was not a one-off call. Instead, the Trump administration had been involved in a sweeping, sustained effort since at least spring 2019 to dig up dirt in Ukraine. Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, conducted a series of meetings with Ukrainian officials, seeking information to discredit Trump\u2019s political rivals. This included then-Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko, who had made public claims of corruption against the Bidens.\n\nIn May, Vice President Mike Pence canceled a scheduled trip to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, with Energy Secretary Rick Perry going in his stead. The whistle-blower says it was \u201cmade clear\u201d that Trump didn\u2019t want to meet with Zelensky until he saw how he \u201cchose to act\u201d in office. \u201cMultiple U.S. officials told me that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelensky would depend on whether Zelensky showing willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues that had been publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani.\u201d In other words, Ukrainian officials understood themselves to be engaged in a quid pro quo even before the July 25 phone call.\n\nThe Trump administration also abruptly fired the ambassador to Ukraine, a respected career Foreign Service officer. In an interview with the Ukrainian press, Giuliani alleged that she had been conspiring against Trump.", "description": "The allegations detail a sustained, months-long effort to pressure Ukraine\u2014and the White House\u2019s attempt to conceal it.", "authors": ["David A.
