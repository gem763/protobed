'With everything that is going on regarding ISIS at the moment and the horrible representation of Islam at the moment... it is justified yes, but it is very sad [to have my religion represented in that way.]\n\n'So I am just glad there is a positive role model. That there is a Muslim girl who isn\u2019t doing anything negative and it is such a positive story.\n\n\u2018I hadn\u2019t realised the enormity of it until two weeks before the race.
