Figured I\u2019d take one for the team. It squashed my nipples and probably broke a rib in the process. My nips looked so sad behind that cheap plastic.\n\n\"They're s***ty plastic (baubles style), the kind that breaks when it's been pressed.\n\n\"Hooks are clear, straps are pingy death traps and the whole thing broke in 30 seconds.\n\n\"It was a wild ride and I hated it, all for \u00a31.99.\"\n\nOn Shein's website, people confirmed her comments, saying the bra was \"unwearable\" and \"horrible\" in the review section, where the product has an average of 3.1 stars out of five.\n\nSomeone else said: \"So bad, don't get it.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Very hard plastic, almost like a water bottle. Also runs small.\"\n\nMany people also reported that the plastic was broken by the time their order arrived and that the fit was very small.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nShein's customer service department has been responding to comments with the same message.\n\nIt reads: \"Dear customer, Thank you so much for ordering from our site and we deeply apologize if our items did not live up to your expectation.\n\n\"We have strict quality assurance before each product is packed and shipped, making sure they are delivered to you as advertised.
