The patients who were studied were aged between 40 to 85 years who suffered a heart attack or ischemic stroke from 2001 to 2012.\n\nAccording to the research, when compared to non-owners, people who owned a dog had a 33 percent lower risk of death, who stayed alone after hospitalisation. 15 percent lower risk for people living with a partner or a child.\n\nDon't Miss 157 SHARES 1.8 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 893 SHARES\n\nThe research also found that the risk of death for stroke patients living alone after hospitalisation for 27 percent lower. 12 percent lower risk for people living with a partner or child.\n\nThe lower risk of death between dog owners and non-owners could be linked to the increase in physical activity with lower levels of depression, something that is already evident from previous studies related to dog ownership.\n\nRepresentative Image: Pixabay\n\nAccording to Tove Fall, D.V.M., Profesor at Uppsala University, Sweden, \"We know that social isolation is a strong risk factor for worse health outcomes and premature death. Previous studies have indicated that dog owners experience less social isolation and have more interaction with other people. Furthermore, keeping a dog is a good motivation for physical activity, which is an important factor in rehabilitation and mental health.\"\n\nHe further added, \"The results of this study suggest positive effects of dog ownership for patients who have experienced a heart attack or stroke. However, more research is needed to confirm a causal relationship and giving recommendations about prescribing dogs for prevention. Moreover, from an animal welfare perspective, dogs should only be acquired by people who feel they have the capacity and knowledge to give the pet a good life.\"", "description": "If your parents or partner isn't allowing you to get a dog at home, you should definitely make them read this.
