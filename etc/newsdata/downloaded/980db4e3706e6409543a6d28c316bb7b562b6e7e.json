Even if they have nothing to do with Pokemon trainers.\n\nBut until that happens, the internet's massive congratulations is probably good enough for Ash.", "description": "After 22 years, Pokemon\u2019s main character Ash Ketchum wins the Alola League to become a Pokemon Master.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/AshKetchum_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
