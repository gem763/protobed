Let\u2019s celebrate this milestone together! Per People, an episode from earlier this week found Singh and Jessica Alba bantering about their recent meeting at Alba\u2019s home, where her two young daughters wore hair towel wraps to say hi to Singh \u2060\u2014 as they recently took a shower and had wet hair. \u201cThey\u2019re really good at being cool, especially with people that they geek out over like you,\u201d Alba reminisced. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to be cool about it.\u201d Singh, noting their hair wraps, jokingly responded: \u201cThey look like my Punjabi friends. It\u2019s fine.\u201d Following the episode\u2019s airing, Singh was apparently bombarded with a decent amount of social media criticism for the joke, and she offered a \u201cimportant and heartfelt\u201d apology in response.\n\n\u201cIn a recent episode of my show, I stupidly made a comparison about turbans that I\u2019d like to apologize for,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the moment, my thought process was \u2018don\u2019t be embarrassed! I think that\u2019s dope.\u2019 But in hindsight I recognize that was a disrespectful and problematic joke to make that has a lot of painful history behind it. And I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d\n\nA very important and heartfelt apology. I\u2019m sorry. And thank you for helping me grow \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Q2JBI2VEDj \u2014 Lilly Singh // #LateWithLilly (@Lilly) September 27, 2019\n\nA Little Late With Lilly Singh replaced Carson Daly\u2019s long-running show on the network, Last Call, after nearly two decades.
