However these mines as you well know were both industrial and social hubs.\n\nThey should be turned into skills training campuses. Workers and staff that are affected by the closures should be trained to lecture in the skills that they have learned.\n\nThese facilities should be used to train electricians, boilermakers, plumbers, woodworkers, builders and so on.\n\nThe hospitals should be turned into nursing colleges.\n\nAccommodation should be converted into student residents.\n\nThis country needs basic skills to be developed for the economy to have a sound base. People that are employable with much needed skills.\n\nSo think about it, turn the mines on both the East Rand and West Rand into technical campuses. The Free State as well, even a mine like Phalaborwa.\n\nAll of this will come at a low cost but high benefit to the economy.\n\nStop dreaming of high speed trains, the fourth industrial revolution, when we do not even have the basics to meet the requirements of past revolutions!\n\nIan Hamilton", "description": "There is a paucity of ideas as to how to lift the South African economy.
