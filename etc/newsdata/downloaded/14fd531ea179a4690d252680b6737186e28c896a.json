Under the legislation, abortionists were required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within a 30-mile radius in order to provide continuity of care should a woman need emergency treatment as a result of an abortion.\n\nA Louisiana federal district judge cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2016 in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt (WWH) in the decision that Act 620 violated a woman\u2019s constitutional right to abortion as invented by the Court in the 1973 landmark case of Roe v. Wade.\n\nA panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the lower court\u2019s decision, and the full court denied the abortion providers\u2019 petition to rehear the Louisiana case.\n\nLawyers for the abortion providers subsequently applied to the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency stay while they prepared their petition for the Court to hear their case.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted the stay, 5-4, with Chief Justice John Robert siding with the liberal wing of the Court, and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh dissenting. The stay was to last only until the Court received a petition to hear the case and voted on it.\n\nPlanned Parenthood acting President Alexis McGill Johnson took to Twitter to express the common abortion proponents\u2019 message that access to abortion must be protected at all costs:\n\nOnly 3 remaining health centers provide safe, legal abortion for nearly 1 million women of reproductive age in Louisiana. If the Supreme Court fails to follow precedent & upholds Louisiana\u2019s anti-abortion law, it could make getting an abortion virtually impossible in the state. https://t.co/NzG3Lp4UNb \u2014 Alexis McGill Johnson (@alexismcgill) October 4, 2019\n\nHowever, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, said the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear a case about an abortion safety regulation is timely.\n\n\u201cAbortion activists are more than willing to lower the bar on women\u2019s health in order to expand abortion, but stricter clinic regulations are in the best interest of women,\u201d she said in a statement, adding:\n\nJust recently we were reminded of the need for more oversight when it comes to abortion, not less, with the appalling case of the abortionist Ulrich Klopfer who collected thousands of aborted babies\u2019 bodies in his home. We applaud the Louisiana bill\u2019s sponsor Katrina Jackson [D] as well as its other supporters for taking concrete steps to protect women in that state.\n\nObserving the possibility that the Court could overturn the 2016 Hellerstedt decision, Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life said, \u201cSuch corrective action is very much needed because we cannot permit laws reasonably related to protecting the health of women be automatically struck down simply because certain abortion facilities would close.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any case, we know that the abortion industry is the most unregulated surgical industry in the nation and that its practitioners are the losers and washouts of the medical profession,\u201d he continued. \u201cWomen need protection from abortionists and their shoddy practices.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said the Supreme Court \u201cnow has a chance in this case to reconsider, reverse, and return Roe v. Wade and the issue of abortion to the American people, which is long overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cStates should absolutely have the right to pass their own health and safety standards designed to protect women inside abortion vendors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe inhumanity of abortion must be debated.\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court announced\u00a0it will hear the case of a LA abortion safety regulation that requires abortionists to have admitting privileges.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/womens-health-abortion-clinic-file-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
