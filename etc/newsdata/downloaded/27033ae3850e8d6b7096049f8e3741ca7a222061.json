Turkey has, since then, begun an aggressive military campaign which has led to a mounting death toll and the displacement of already a hundred thousand civilians according to the United Nations. Turkish proxies, mostly Jihadist groups used in this military campaign, have allegedly committed acts of war and there are fears of demographic changes as well as the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds.\n\nThere are thousands of IS fighters in prisons guarded by the SDF. The ongoing fighting between the Kurdish-led SDF and the Turkish army has loosened the grip of the SDF over those prisons and has already caused former IS fighters to break out. Zana Kurda Researcher and EU affairs expert\n\nApart from the immediate disastrous results for the Kurds who have freed their areas from Islamic State (IS) with tremendous sacrifice, the US troops\u2019 pull-out will have vast security implications for Europe as well. There are thousands of IS fighters in prisons guarded by the SDF. The ongoing fighting between the Kurdish-led SDF and the Turkish army has loosened the grip of the SDF over those prisons and has already caused former IS fighters to break out. This will, it is believed, create a conducive environment for the revival of IS in Syria and Iraq, which will in turn have a stimulus effect on IS sleeper cells across Europe. It is evident that the Turkish invasion has not only destabilized the EU\u2019s borders, but has also created a potentially disastrous situation for Europe\u2019s internal security in the long term.\n\nThe principal question is thus not whether Europe should react, but rather with which sense of gravity and urgency? So far, neither the EU nor its member states have dealt with the Turkish invasion of north-east Syria with an absolute level of seriousness. Apart from condemnations, the Council of the European Union has failed to agree on any collective EU sanctions on Turkey, and it is very much the question of the hour whether the EU leaders will succeed in doing so. It is clear that with the threat of \u2018opening the gates\u2019 for the 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, the EU has been once again strong armed by Erdogan\u2019s Turkey.\n\nThat being said, it does not mean that the EU is totally out of the picture. France and Germany, together with a number of EU member states, have unilaterally suspended weapon sales to Turkey. France and Germany could lead collective European efforts of a number of \u2018willing member states\u2019 to find diplomatic and military options for northern Syria. There is a precedent for this.\n\nWhen IS approached the Iraqi Kurdistan\u2019s capital Erbil in August 2014, it was France that took the lead at the EU level. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabuis, called his EU counterparts back from their holiday. To illustrate the sense of urgency with which France reacted at that time, in one instant, a colleague foreign minister had indicated that they are on holiday and resting. Fabius had replied by saying \u201cno time for resting now; we rest when we die.\u201d The EU Foreign Council convened for an urgent meeting on 15 August 2014. In that meeting, the foreign ministers decided that EU member states were allowed to provide military aid to the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in their fight against IS. That decision, taken in the EU context, paved the way for a number of EU member states, including Germany, to help the Kurdish Peshmerga and in so doing, shifting the balance of power in favour of the Kurds.\n\nFor Europe, the cost of inaction may therefore be greater than taking firm and immediate action, even if that would put (trade) relations with Turkey at risk. Zana Kurda Researcher and EU affairs expert\n\nIn addition to the EU, being a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council allows France to pursue other diplomatic and military options. France could present an urgent resolution in the UN Security Council calling for the establishment of a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d over northern Syria. Meanwhile given the threat linked to the revival of IS, France, Germany and other willing European countries could actively work in the context of the Global Coalition against IS on assembling a ground force in northern Syria. Such a multi-national force could contribute to enforcing the \u201cno-fly zone\u201d while also assuming responsibility for the IS prisons. The European partners, especially France and Germany, could work closely, co-ordinating their actions to pursue all diplomatic and military options.\n\nThe Trump administration has been clear that it has no interest in bearing the cost of stability in northern Syria. The threat of Islamic State\u2019s revival or the protection of Kurdish allies are no longer valid arguments for the US to keep its troops in northeast Syria. In the midst of this, Turkey\u2019s military campaign will lead to further escalation and humanitarian disaster, while it may also be the start of profound long-term threats to Europe\u2019s security.\n\nFor Europe, the cost of inaction may therefore be greater than taking firm and immediate action, even if that would put (trade) relations with Turkey at risk. It is a moment of truth for the European Union and its member states to show the world that they are determined to act forcefully in protecting human rights as well as preserving Europe\u2019s security.\n\nZana Kurda\n\nZana Kurda is an EU affairs expert and a PhD researcher at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels.\n\n____________\n\nAre you a recognised expert in your field?
