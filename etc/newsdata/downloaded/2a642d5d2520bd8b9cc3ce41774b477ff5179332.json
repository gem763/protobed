The pair \u2018immediately clicked\u2019 and soon became good friends.\n\nWhile Elton was working on The Lion King, head of Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg, came over to England with his wife. When Elton asked if they wanted to meet anyone in particular, they jumped at meeting Diana.\n\nSo Elton, along with his partner David Furnish, invited Princess Diana, George Michael, Richard Curtis and his wife Emma Freud, Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElton wrote: \u2018I couldn\u2019t help [but] notice a strange atmosphere in the room. Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere\u2019s newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all.\n\nPrincess Diana with Elton John and David Furnish (Picture: GERARD JULIEN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I think he may have turned up to the party with the express intention of picking Diana up, only to find his plans for the evening ruined,\u2019 Elton mused.\n\nThe evening progressed as Elton noted Diana and Richard were \u2018locked in rapt conversation\u2019.\n\nWhen it was time for dinner to be served, Richard and Sylvester were no where to be seen.\n\nElton asked David if he could go and see where they might have gotten to and after a little while, David came back and muttered: \u2018We have a situation\u2019.\n\nElton explained: \u2018It transpired that he\u2019d discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fist-fight.\u2019\n\nPrincess Diana talking with Elton John and George Michael (Photo: Popperfoto via Getty Images/Getty Images)\n\nAfter dinner, Richard and Diana reportedly got cosy by the fire together so Sylvester decided to \u2018storm off\u2019 home.\n\nElton recalled Sylvester remarked: \u2018I never would have come if I\u2019d known Prince f***in\u2019 Charming was gonna be here.\u2019\n\n\u2018If I\u2019d wanted her, I would\u2019ve taken her!\u2019 Sylvester angrily said as he walked out the front door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElton John\u2019s official autobiography, Me, is due to be released 15 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
