His hopes of being involved against France must be in doubt, but he will be desperate to play - and to turn a corner.\n\nThe captain has not hit his stride at this World Cup. In the opener against Tonga in Sapporo, he was steady, nothing more, as England laboured to put away the Pacific Islanders.\n\nThen there was a half-hour cameo against the United States which was most notable for the fact Farrell was smashed high by John Quill, which earned the Eagles' flanker a red card.\n\nUSA flanker John Quill was sent off for this massive and illegal tackle on Owen Farrell\n\nThe England fly-half was also flattened by Argentina lock Thomas Lavanini with this hit\n\nNine days later, the skipper suffered a similar fate against Argentina, as Pumas lock Tomas Lavanini was sent off for a tackle which saw his shoulder collide with Farrell's head.\n\nOnce again, the 28-year-old Saracen returned to action, but there were concerns the illegal hit had taken its toll.\n\nIn the first half, he missed four successive kicks at goal, an all but unheard of sequence of lapses by one of the game's premier kickers. After the break, he kept running into trouble behind the gainline. Farrell appeared to be hesitant in possession and was ambushed. All the while, his friend George Ford was directing traffic with serene authority and efficiency at No 10.\n\nIn the aftermath of the victory over Argentina, Farrell insisted he was clear-headed and that he had not been excessively shaken up by Lavanini's wild challenge so soon after the one by Quill. But the evidence suggested otherwise. He wasn't himself. There was no sign of the decisive, clinical playmaker England have so often relied upon.\n\nThey need that playmaker back, which is why Eddie Jones must decide on Wednesday whether to deploy Farrell against France, or rest him because qualification for the quarter-finals is assured.\n\nFarrell has not been at his best and was repeatedly caught hesitating behind the gain line\n\nLast Saturday, Jones claimed Farrell was 'outstanding' \u2014 more in reference to his leadership than his personal performance. On Tuesday, attack coach Scott Wisemantel delivered a further assessment.\n\n'In regard to the weekend, I don't think the bump had any effect on him,' Wisemantel said. 'I asked after the game. He said he felt pretty good \u2014 just a bit clunky with a few of the plays. We have reviewed it and there are a couple of areas we need to pick up on, but he was fine. He did outstandingly well.\n\n'He is a tough, competitive player who, if anything because he competes so hard, probably tries to over-rectify the situation. There were a couple of things. And it wasn't just Owen. In and around him there were a few things that were clunky.\n\n'When I say clunky, look, I am a perfectionist. You're never going to get a perfect game of rugby. We scored six tries and five to the backs, so we are not too clunky!\n\n'I probably exaggerated, because there is a story there with Owen, you are going down that route and I'm trying to deflect.\n\nFarrell's poor goal-kicking is also a concern and England need him to find his rhythm again\n\n'It is not just Owen, there are other things that I see around him that aren't perfect that we need to get right. So I don't think you can read into it too much as far as Owen's performance (is concerned), because in general he was very good and did the role we wanted him to play.'\n\nThat is a pertinent part of any debate about Farrell's form \u2014 the role he is being asked to play. He is a fly-half by nature, but once again he is operating at inside centre, with Ford at 10.\n\nIt may not be his preference, but any suggestion that the arrangement doesn't suit him appears to be a red herring when considering his and England's better record with a Ford-Farrell creative axis.\n\nThey were working in tandem at 10-12 during the world-record run of Test wins after Jones took charge.\n\n'The thing about the dynamic is Owen becomes more of a runner at 12,' said Wisemantel.\n\n'You can pull it apart and say he is not his usual self, but he is more of a runner, so you are seeing a different Owen. You are not seeing the distributor all the time because George fills that role. It is changing roles. George is doing exceptionally well.'\n\nEngland are at pains to insist they don't believe Farrell is being targeted for rough treatment. Wisemantel said: 'I just think it's dumb luck. It didn't matter who was there, they would have got hit. It's just bad luck, and if you touch the ball a lot, your chances get a bit greater. I don't think he was targeted.'\n\nThe 28-year-old described some of the plays as 'clunky' but said the hits did not effect him\n\nThe England camp categorically refute any suggestion that they should have handled Farrell with greater care, by bringing their prized asset off for head injury assessments after the two high hits on him.\n\n'The referee was right there,' said Wisemantel. 'Nigel Owens discussed it, so he makes a call and the medics make a call.\n\n'Owen said he was fine, but it's not down to him. It is down to the medics. You had the referee, medics and Owen. So you had three separate sources \u2014 all can make separate decisions. Any one of them, if there is doubt, he is off. He got a clean bill of health from three different sources.'\n\nSo, England are satisfied Farrell has been treated correctly. But if there was no scrambling of the senses, his performance against Argentina made no sense. It is surely best to tread carefully, remove him from the firing line this weekend and aim for a return to the team and top form in the quarter-final.\n\nOn Wednesday it's decision time. 'We need to look at whether it is worthwhile resting him,' Wisemantel said.\n\nIt does appear worthwhile. England need vintage Farrell. They haven't had that yet here in Japan.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO:  Owen Farrell was ill on Tuesday, so he was unable to take a full part in England training.
