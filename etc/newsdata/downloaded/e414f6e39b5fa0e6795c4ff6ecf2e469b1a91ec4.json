There is little expectation of an imminent resolution to the disagreement, which continues to sap economic growth.\n\n\"The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected,\" said WTO chief Roberto Azevedo.\n\nThe WTO sees continued risks from the trade wars, saying that \"further rounds of tariffs and retaliation could produce a destructive cycle of recrimination.\"\n\nThe organization noted some economies are slowing anyway and other issues, such as the U.K's anticipated exit from the European Union, are adding to uncertainty for businesses trading goods.", "description": "Global trade is forecast to weaken this year to the slowest pace since the depths of the Great Recession due to the U.S.-China trade war.
