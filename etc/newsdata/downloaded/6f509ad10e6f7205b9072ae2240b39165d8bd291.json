Should They Be Paid?", "language": "en", "text": "Others have proposed sending a monthly check to parents for any caregiving needs, as Canada, Australia and most European countries do (or, in Mr. Yang\u2019s case, sending a check to every American). Six of the senators running for president support the idea: Michael Bennet, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Mr. Booker.\n\nThey are co-sponsors of the American Family Act of 2019, introduced by Senator Bennet. It would send all but the highest-earning families $300 a month for each child up to age 5, and $250 for each child 6 to 16. People who don\u2019t work for pay would be eligible \u2014 in contrast with the existing child tax credit \u2014 and it would be paid monthly, not just at tax time.\n\n\u201cCaregiving is the most meaningful work a parent can do, but for some reason, we\u2019ve made it harder and harder on families,\u201d Mr. Bennet said. The proposal would \u201cgive parents the opportunity to make decisions that are best for their families,\u201d he said.\n\nOther candidates, including Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, also want to create a Social Security credit for people who take time out of the work force to care for family, \u201cto compensate the more than 43 million unpaid family caregivers for their work,\u201d according to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. (Ms. Warren, in her 2003 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d proposed giving at-home parents a subsidy, though she did not include that in her 2020 campaign plan for subsidized child care and preschool.)\n\nThe general idea behind the proposals is that children need care \u2014 and families take a financial hit to provide it, whether they buy child care or stop working. Child care costs have been rising, and in many places it\u2019s difficult to find high-quality care.\n\nAlso, more than half of Americans say they believe young children should have a parent at home, and more than half of mothers say they would prefer to stay home (even though most parents work).\n\nImage Andrew Yang on his way to a stage in Des Moines last month. He said recently, \u201cThe question is: What do we mean by work?\u201d Credit Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press\n\nMost of the Democratic candidates have proposed some form of subsidized child care or public preschool, and some say that a corresponding subsidy for at-home caregivers would allow parents to choose who cares for their children. (President Trump made a similar proposal when he was running for president, but did not include it in his tax plan.)", "description": "The idea, a favorite of social conservatives, is now supported by several Democratic presidential candidates.", "authors": ["Claire Cain Miller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/upshot/up-housework/up-housework-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
