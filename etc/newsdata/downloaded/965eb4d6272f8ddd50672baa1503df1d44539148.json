The design students took the inspiration and the Disney magic with them, too.\n\nTen student finalists were chosen from nearly 100 submissions to have their ensembles exhibited at FIT\u2019s Art & Design Gallery in the Pomerantz Art and Design Center \u2014 and meet their corresponding Broadway counterpart.\n\nAshna Moogi, a third-year fashion design student at FIT, designed and created two looks for ice queen Elsa from \"Frozen.\"\n\n\"Elsa seems to be really soft on the inside but harsh on the outside, and that's something I really connect to. I feel like my personality corresponds to her a lot,\" says Moogi. \"The structural parts of my design show her structured personality and how she's holding it all together and trying to conceal her powers, while the free-flowing trails show her love for her family.\"\n\nTo modernize the costume while remaining true to the character, Moogi utilized the color of Elsa's iconic blue gown to create a pant-and-corset ensemble as well as a gown. \"I wanted to make one gown to capture the glamorous queen that she is, but the pant seemed more practical, more contemporary \u2013 something she would wear in today's world,\" says Moogi. The high slit on the gown makes the luxe garment equally as pragmatic as the pantsuit, which is perfect for Elsa's casual hobbies of climbing icy mountains and building enchanting castles. Moogi also hand-applied rhinestones onto both garments to represent Elsa's iciness.\n\nView photos Ashna Moogi, a fashion design student at the Fashion Institute of Technology, with her winning garments designed for Elsa from 'Frozen.'

That's the biggest sign of equality in gender. I wanted to do a pant, but I wanted to keep that skirt volume, so I have this accentuated waist and the strong shoulders like the costumes do,\" says Wells. \"[Katherine] wears a lot of these skirts, which Kara, the actress that played her, told me were so heavy because she had to dance.\" Prior to this competition, Wells had been friends with the actress who originated the role on Broadway, Kara Lindsay, which led to her choice to redesign this particular character.", "description": "In celebration of Disney on Broadway\u2019s 25th anniversary (beginning with \"Beauty and the Beast\" in 1994!), the powerhouse partnered with the Fashion Institute of Technology and challenged students to modernize the classic looks of its most beloved female characters.
