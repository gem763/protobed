The White House then tried to \u201clock down\u201d the information to cover it up, the complaint says.\n\nThe 9-page document was released Thursday ahead of testimony to House investigators from Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint is at least in part related to the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump prodded Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden. The White House released a rough transcript of that call on Wednesday.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleges that White House officials were directed by White House lawyers to \u201cremove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to cabinet level officials.\u201d\n\nSee also: Why the impeachment inquiry into President Trump and a brutal 2020 election could cost American companies billions\n\nRelated: Whistleblower alleges Trump White House moved records onto separate network\n\nThe anonymous whistleblower says that despite his or her not being present for the call, multiple White House officials shared consistent details about it.\n\nThe document, with its precise detail and clear narrative, will likely accelerate the impeachment process and put more pressure on Trump to rebut its core contentions and on his fellow Republicans to defend him. The complaint also provides a road map for corroborating witnesses, which will complicate the president\u2019s effort to characterize the findings as those of a lone partisan out to undermine him.\n\nStill, Trump immediately tweeted, \u201cThe Democrats are trying to destroy the Republican Party and all that it stands for. Stick together, play their game and fight hard Republicans. Our country is at stake.\u201d The tweet was in all capital letters.\n\nHouse Democrats who are now mulling Trump\u2019s impeachment are hoping Maguire will explain why he withheld the intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint from Congress for weeks. Maguire will then go behind closed doors to speak to the Senate intelligence panel.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday endorsed an impeachment investigation in light of the Ukraine revelations.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the White House said \u201cnothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings, all of which shows nothing improper.\u201d", "description": "White House officials were \u2018directed\u2019 by lawyers to \u2018remove the electronic transcript\u2019 of the call.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GC485_18trum_ZG_20180125205653.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
