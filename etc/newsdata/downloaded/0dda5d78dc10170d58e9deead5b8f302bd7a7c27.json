The \u00admystery surrounding Spray\u2019s tragic fate is simply not \u00adacceptable.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nNo, everything about \u00adEngland\u2019s couple of days in Sofia relegated the actual football to a triviality.\n\nWhich, of course, in the context of racial abuse and a fatality, it truly is.\n\nBut, as Tyrone Mings pointed out in a post-match tweet, the football was not bad. The English football, not the Bulgarian football \u2013 that was rubbish.\n\nAnd that has to be the context for making any judgements on English players.\n\nHad the focus not shifted to far more serious matters, though, Monday would have gone down as a landmark game in the career of Ross Barkley .\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nTwo goals and a couple of sublime passes \u2013 a driving, \u00adattacking performance, the type everyone expected from the \u00admoment Barkley emerged on the scene in 2011 with Everton.\n\nBut the truth is that few managers, of his club or \u00adcountry, have really trusted Barkley. Maybe Roberto \u00adMartinez had the fullest faith and Antonio Conte must have quite liked him, having been in charge when Barkley moved to Stamford Bridge in January of 2018.\n\nHowever, there have always been reservations.\n\nGareth Southgate seems unsure, hence why Mason Mount got the nod ahead of Barkley in Prague.\n\nWe all know Southgate can do little wrong, but that was a decision that backfired badly.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nPrior to yesterday\u2019s match against Newcastle when both were in the starting XI for Chelsea, Mount - across all competitions - had made 10 starts for his club this season, twice Barkley\u2019s total.\n\nIt has not helped Barkley that he has been prone to the odd spot of off-the-field bother, taking a punch in a Liverpool nightclub in 2017 and dropping his chips on the floor of a cab the other week.\n\nWhile he represented \u00adEngland at every junior level through to the Under-21s, he is not an archetypal St George\u2019s Park product.\n\nBut what Barkley, whose potential remains unfulfilled a couple of months shy of his 26th birthday, showed in Sofia is that he can be England\u2019s game-changer.\n\nHe can be that creative, driving midfield force that England are crying out for and that Chelsea could \u00adcertainly use.\n\nOctober 14, 2019, in Sofia will be remembered for all the wrong, very sad, reasons.\n\nBut it might just have been when one of the most \u00adprodigious talents in English football finally came of age.", "description": "The Chelsea midfielder scored two and produced a performance all England fans have been waiting for", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
