Watch this space.\n\nThe Golf 8 features more than 2 700 individual parts and components, 962 wiring systems with 1 340 meters of cable, worked on exclusively by 8 400 employees.\n\n\n\nSPIED: This will be the new Volkswagen Golf Mk8\n\nProduction journey\n\nIt then travels a total of 69-kilometeres on production lines until the finished vehicle leaves the factory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf 8 spyshot - Image: AutoMedia \"The Golf 8 is much more complex than its predecessor. Nevertheless, we have cut average manufacturing time by about one hour. Because the Golf 8 belongs to the second-generation of MQB products, we achieved a significant reduction in production investments,\" says Dr. Andreas Tostmann, Volkswagen Brand Board Member for Production. \"Our platform strategy is delivering. The team in Wolfsburg have given their all for the Golf 8. Production processes have become more efficient overall. That is a great achievement and I would like to say a big thank you to all employees.\u201d\n\nThe Golf 8 is based on the Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB), just like its predecessor, with new equipment being installed for the side panels and being 40% more productive that the equipment used for the Golf 7.\n\n\n\nOPINION | Here's what you really should know about the VW Golf GTI\n\n\n\n\n\nVW Golf 8 spypic - Image: AutoMedia\n\nEarlier in 2019 Wheels24 reported that the new Golf 8 is built on a revised version of the MQB platform, the new Golf will be powered by a combination of familiar, and new engines.\n\n\n\nThe 1.0 TSI and 1.5 TSI should form the bulk of its sales, though from what we understand, the 2.0 TDI will still be around. VW put a lot of work into developing a mild-hybrid assistance system to lower emissions further.\n\n\n\nRumours talked about a new base TDI, a 1.5-litre unit built using the TSI's architecture. The displacement has not been confirmed but falls in line with changes made by both Peugeot and Ford.\n\n\n\nIt will also be one of the first VW models to feature the brand's new logo.\n\nImage: Newspress\n\nInstalling all data, is fully-automated and carried out via a fast WLAN network while the car is still on the production line.
