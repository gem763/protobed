REUTERS/Aziz Taher\n\nSmall groups of demonstrators gathered in central Beirut in an effort to keep the protests going, with storefronts of banks and upmarket retailers in the capital\u2019s commercial district smashed in and fires still smouldering from the night before.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri gave his government partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree on reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign.\n\nThe latest unrest erupted out of anger over the rising cost of living and new tax plans, including a fee on WhatsApp calls, which was quickly retracted after protests - the biggest in decades - broke out.\n\nIn a televised speech addressing the protests on Saturday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the group opposed the government\u2019s resignation, and that the country did not have enough time for such a move given the acute financial crisis.\n\n\u201cEveryone should take responsibility rather than being preoccupied with settling political scores while leaving the fate of the country unknown,\u201d said Nasrallah, adding that Lebanon could face \u201cfinancial collapse\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll of us have to shoulder the responsibility of the current situation that we arrived at in Lebanon. Everyone should take part in finding a solution,\u201d added Nasrallah, whose Iranian-backed Shi\u2019ite group is Lebanon\u2019s most influential.\n\nThe protests that swept villages and towns across the country on Friday recalled the 2011 Arab revolts that toppled four presidents. Lebanese from all sects and walks of life waved banners and chanted for Hariri\u2019s government to go.\n\n\u201cPeople will definitely go back out today because they\u2019re in pain,\u201d said Ramzi Ismail,a 60-year-old engineer. \u201cBut we are against clashes with the army or security forces and vandalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cTWO BIG DANGERS\u201d\n\nIn the speech, Nasarallah predicted that imposing more taxes would lead to an \u201cexplosion\u201d of unrest.\n\nHe said Lebanon was facing two big dangers - financial and economic meltdown and popular unrest.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t work toward a solution we\u2019re heading toward a collapse of the country, it will be bankrupt and our currency will not have any value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second danger is a popular explosion as a result of wrong handling of the situation,\u201d Nasrallah said.\n\nThe unusually wide geographic reach of protests has highlighted the deepening anger of the Lebanese. The government, which includes nearly all Lebanon\u2019s main parties, has repeatedly failed to implement reforms needed to fix the national finances.\n\n\u201cThe protests must continue because this is a matter of our dignity. We\u2019ll be left humiliated otherwise,\u201d said Miriam Keserwan, 28.\n\nRiot police in vehicles and on foot rounded up protesters late on Friday, firing rubber bullets and tear gas canisters to disperse riots in Beirut that grew violent as the night wore on, leaving streets strewn with glass and burning debris.\n\nLebanon\u2019s internal security apparatus said 52 police were injured on Friday and its forces arrested 70 people.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t blame the people who are doing this,\u201d said 26-year-old Charbel Abyad, referring to the city\u2019s damage. \u201cSome have no jobs, no healthcare and no education. They are being mistreated and they can\u2019t help but express it this way.\u201d", "description": "Lebanon braced for a third day of unrest on Saturday after anti-government protests fueled by rising fury over an economic crisis erupted across the country and\u00a0descended into riots on the streets of Beirut.", "authors": ["Eric Knecht", "Laila Bassam", "Suleiman Al-Khalidi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442641449&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I093-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
