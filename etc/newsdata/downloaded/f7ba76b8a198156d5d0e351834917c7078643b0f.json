Smith abruptly resigned from Fox on Friday after being repeatedly criticized by Trump.\n\nFollowing Wallace\u2019s program Sunday, Trump fired off a tweet demanding that \u201csomebody please explain to Chris Wallace\u201d that Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cwas a congenial & good one.\u201d In the call, now the focus of an impeachment inquiry, Trump pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son \u2014 while withholding military aid from the nation.\n\nTrump also slammed Chris Wallace as someone who \u201cwill never be his father,\u201d the late \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stalwart Mike Wallace, whom Trump claimed was \u201cmy friend.\u201d\n\nSomebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox, who will never be his father (and my friend), Mike Wallace, that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial & good one. It was only Schiff\u2019s made up version of that conversation that was bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nTrump slammed Wallace shortly after his program with Defense Secretary Mark Esper questioning the president\u2019s phone call \u2014 and challenging Trump\u2019s order pulling U.S. troops out of Syria to cede the battlefield to Turkey in that nation\u2019s assault on America\u2019s longtime Kurdish allies.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s move opens the way for Turkish forces to launch an assault against the Kurds, the key American ally in the fight against ISIS,\u201d Wallace said. (Check out the video above.)\n\nTrump also invoked Mike Wallace earlier this year when he complained about Chris Wallace having Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on his program. \u201cI like Mike Wallace better,\u201d Trump tweeted then.\n\nAt a panel discussion in Manhattan last month, Wallace noted that Trump \u201coften likes to say about me, \u2018You know, I was covered by Mike Wallace, I liked him much more,\u2019\u201d The New York Times reported.\n\nWallace quipped: \u201cOne of us has a daddy problem, and it\u2019s not me.\u201d", "description": "Wallace will \"never be his father,\" Trump complained, referring to the late TV journalist Mike Wallace.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da3ed00210000150c344b30.jpeg?cache=bwfyvjbx6a&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
