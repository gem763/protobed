(In it, she claims that he cheated twice on her among other thing.) But it turns out that\u2019s not the case.\n\nWhen followers first text the number, Kutcher responds with a link, urging them to click for more information from the celebrity.\n\nFor truth text me. +1 (319) 519-0576 \u2014 ashton kutcher (@aplusk) September 25, 2019\n\nIn a follow-up message, the actor begins to discuss his thoughts on Trump\u2019s possible impeachment \u2014 which has gained steam amid a spiraling controversy about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky to investigate Vice President Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s political rival, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nThere have been additional reports that Trump had U.S. aid to Ukraine frozen, in what critics say was a tactic to push the country\u2019s officials for Biden dirt, but Trump said the two things were unrelated and that he wanted European allies to contribute more to Ukraine.\n\nKutcher shared that he and his wife, Mila Kunis, who was born in Ukraine, recently met with Zelensky and Zelensky\u2019s wife, Olena Zelenska.\n\n\u201cMy gut: He is committed to eliminating corruption in Ukraine. He\u2019s also committed to ending the war and grateful for the US financial commitment because they needed it,\u201d Kutcher wrote in the public message.\n\nThe actor then switched the topic to his thoughts on Trump\u2019s relationship with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cIf our president used that financial aid to leverage president Zelensky to investigate Biden should be impeached. If our president did not use it as leverage and simply encouraged president Zelensky to investigate Biden without cause he should be impeached,\u201d he continued.\n\nLamest text I\u2019ve ever gotten ....\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/yZyqOZqLeu \u2014 Michelle (@Proberbs31Mommy) September 25, 2019\n\nAdding, \u201cIf you like President Trump or not America is the priority soliciting foreign interference in our election in [sic] unAmerican.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ashton Kutcher Seemingly Responds to Demi Moore\u2019s Cheating Allegations: \u2018Life Is Good\u2019\n\nThe Ranch star was also very active on Twitter Wednesday, sending out several tweets seemingly about the president.\n\n\u201cBuzz words: witch hunt, collusion, fake news.
