Scotland has a superstar now.\u2019\n\nJames continued: \u2018People have told him that he sounds like me.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s all water under the bridge now eh James? (Picture: Mike Lewis Photography/Getty Images)\n\nJames said that Lewis spammed him with tweets (Picture: FilmMagic for Life is Beautiful\n\nSource: FilmMagic)\n\nThe X Factor winner, who has released a new album called You also spoke about how he wants to take a break from music.\n\nHe said: \u2018At some point, I would like to take a break from music and I\u2019d like to get involved in films. I am really interested in that.\u2019\n\nAddressing the \u2018tough time\u2019 is has gone through during his career James added: \u2018I think I care less about what people think now and when you hit 30 you start to live life for yourself in a good way.\n\n\u2018I think before I was looking for validation in an unhealthy way and as a kid, I wanted to be the best and I got bogged down with that as I thought I wouldn\u2019t be considered good enough.\n\n\u2018I was down about it at the time but now I do it because I love it and I have some amazing fans that come to my shows.\u2019\n\nRecently James also appeared on This Morning where he spoke about how he was \u2018snubbed\u2019 from the Glastonbury line-up.\n\nSpeaking to hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford, Arthur explained his comments further \u2013 outlining how he believes he\u2019s overlooked from performing at these festivals due to his X Factor origins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Basically, I would love to be considered credible enough to perform at those things,\u2019 Arthur said. \u2018I think I was made to perform at Glastonbury and these big festivals.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a musician. I\u2019ve worked very hard, it\u2019s been seven years since the X Factor. It\u2019s amazing I\u2019ve managed to sustain a career. It\u2019s amazing what the likes of myself, Olly Murs, Little Mix, what we\u2019ve been able to do to be considered viable enough \u2013 to come from a show like that and still be relevant because there is a little bit of snobbery attached to being from a reality TV show.\n\n\u2018And maybe we get overlooked for things like that. For me, it sucks because I believe I\u2019m made for those kind of things.\u2019\n\nLorraine airs weekdays at 8.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
