Per @FinancialTimes they provided statements that were translated differently in Chinese and English. Talk about duplicitous. Just pathetic. pic.twitter.com/H242uecC5H \u2014 Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) October 7, 2019\n\nThe NBA\u2019s response triggered a major public backlash. Critics pointed to China\u2019s appalling human rights record and restrictions on freedom of expression.\n\nIn an attempt at damage control, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver came out with another statement hailing the importance of freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear \u2026 that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech, and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d\n\nSilver admitted that the incident had severely impacted the NBA\u2019s reputation and standing with the Chinese Communist Party, leading to a considerable loss of earnings.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\u201d Silver told Kyodo News in Japan. \u201cThere have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese state-run television network CCTV said the country remained \u201cstrongly dissatisfied\u201d with the NBA\u2019s refusal to explicitly apologize. As a result, Chinese authorities have stopped broadcasting NBA games while removing all the organization\u2019s promotional material.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "A couple attending a 76ers game against the Chinese team Guangzhou Loong Lions were ejected after holding signs and shouting support for Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Guangzhou-Loong-Lions-game-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
