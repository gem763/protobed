He reassured MPs that parliament will still have \u201cample time\u201d to debate Brexit.\n\nHowever, critics argued the move is an attempt to hinder MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn his letter, Johnson said the current two-year parliamentary session has \u201cat times seemed more about filling time.\u201d He added: \u201cI therefore intend to bring forward a new bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit. There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition!\u201d\n\nHe said it is right that MPs get to express their view about his plans before and after the European Council summit starting on October 17 \u2014 with votes on the queen\u2019s speech penciled in for October 21 and 22.\n\nDowning Street said a Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be a \u201ccentral feature\u201d of the legislative program, assuming Johnson brokers a Brexit deal with Brussels.\n\nMPs were outraged.\n\nFormer Chancellor Philip Hammond, who has vowed to block a no-deal Brexit, said on Twitter: \u201cIt would be a constitutional outrage if Parliament were prevented from holding the government to account at a time of national crisis. Profoundly undemocratic.\u201d\n\nTory MP Dominic Grieve, who has been central to the plots to prevent a no-deal, said suspending parliament would be \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the prime minister persists with this and doesn't back off, then I think the chances are that his administration will collapse,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\u201cThere is plenty of time to do that if necessary [and] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has been vocal in defending the independence and rights of parliament, also weighed in, calling the move a \"constitutional outrage.\"\n\n\"However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country. At this time, one of the most challenging periods in our nation\u2019s history, it is vital that our elected Parliament has its say.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, said: \u201cI am appalled at the recklessness of Johnson\u2019s government, which talks about sovereignty and yet is seeking to suspend parliament to avoid scrutiny of its plans for a reckless No Deal Brexit. This is an outrage and a threat to our democracy.\n\n\u201cThat is why Labour has been working across Parliament to hold this reckless government to account, and prevent a disastrous No Deal which parliament has already ruled out. If Johnson has confidence in his plans he should put them to the people in a general election or public vote.\u201d\n\nMPs including Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Independent Group for Change leader Anna Soubry and Corbyn himself have called for an audience with the queen to protest the suspension.\n\nThe queen met with Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, Leader of the Lords Natalie Evans and Chief Whip Mark Spencer on Wednesday to rubber-stamp the request.\n\nOne constitutional expert told POLITICO that MPs could still try to legislate to stop a no-deal Brexit when parliament returns from its summer break next week, but would struggle in such a short space of time.\n\nJohnson defended the move in a pooled clip for broadcasters. He said claims the suspension is an \u201cinsult to democracy\u201d are \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing forward a new legislative program on crime, on hospitals, making sure that we have the education funding that we need,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd there will be ample time on both sides of that crucial October 17 summit, ample time in parliament for MPs to debate the EU, to debate Brexit and all the other issues.\u201d\n\nMPs usually have a three-week break during September to hold party conferences, but there had been speculation that this conference recess would be scrapped this year to give extra time to debate Brexit.", "description": "The move will reduce the amount of time MPs have to try to block a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio", "Charlie Cooper", "Stephen Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1149445228-1-1200x628.jpg"}
