None fits the bill as well as the next few days.\n\nThe race is on once again to try to secure a revised exit deal, with the EU and UK engaged in intensified talks ahead of an EU summit. It is due to take place just two weeks before the UK's scheduled departure date on October 31.\n\nMonday 14 October:\n\nTalks in Brussels continue between British and European negotiators, attempting to reach a revised Brexit agreement before the EU summit later in the week. Intensified discussions have been taking place amid reports that compromises are afoot over a replacement to the Irish backstop, which the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to ditch from the original withdrawal agreement.\n\nIn the UK parliament, the Queen\u2019s Speech will set out the government's new programme. It will be followed by six days of debate. The government's opponents have dismissed it as a \u201cstunt\u201d geared more to a forthcoming election campaign than an actual legislative plan, given Johnson's lack of a parliamentary majority. It is unclear whether MPs will pass or reject it when they vote on the speech in the coming days.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meets European Council President Donald Tusk in Paris.\n\nRead more: What is the Queen's Speech and what happens if MPs reject it?\n\nTuesday 15 October:\n\nEurope ministers from EU governments meet in Luxembourg. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is expected to update EU27 ambassadors on progress \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 in the talks.\n\nWednesday 16 October:\n\nThis has been seen as the day a deal would need to be finalised ahead of the EU summit.\n\nIn the UK, various government ministers appear before parliamentary committees, where it is likely they will be questioned on Brexit plans.\n\nEmmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel meet in Toulouse, along with their governments, for a regular Franco-German summit. They\u2019ll be joined in the evening by the next European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nOn the agenda? Climate change, industry, defence and security \u2013 according to the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Europe has questions other than Brexit to consider.\n\nThursday 17 \u2013 Friday 18 October:\n\nThe European Council summit takes place over two days in Brussels. National leaders \u2013 plus the heads of the Council and the Commission \u2013 set the EU\u2019s overall direction. This is when it is hoped they will sign off on a new deal or consider another Brexit extension. It's the last scheduled summit before the October 31 deadline.\n\nIf London and Brussels reach agreement, it has been suggested that EU leaders may consider a framework deal with the details to be filled in later, given the near-impossibility of finalising a full legal text in the time available.\n\nSaturday 19 October:\n\nThe UK\u2019s House of Commons holds a special session, meeting for the first time on a Saturday since the Falklands crisis in 1982.\n\nBoris Johnson will be hoping to put a deal to a vote. But if he returns from the EU summit with no deal, or a deal is not approved by parliament and MPs do not agree to a no-deal exit \u2013 then under the Benn Act the prime minister must write to the EU asking for another Brexit delay of three months.\n\nSupporters of a second referendum are expected to attach an amendment, seeking to put any deal to another public vote.\n\nRead more:\n\nUK parliament to sit on a Saturday for first time in 37 years\n\nCould Boris Johnson bypass the Benn Act and force a no-deal Brexit?\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "The race is on once again to try to secure a revised exit deal, with the EU and UK engaged in intensified talks ahead of an EU summit.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/06/00/1000x563_cmsv2_103239ee-fa6e-5727-9aad-7e1c9b1a9c7c-4230600.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
