Nowhere does it say no one else must contest. None of the young people have availed themselves for the position.\"\n\nHe said the four candidates had much work to do to win top spot.\n\n\"These candidates must canvass us and tell us why we must support them.\"\n\nREAD | Helen Zille's time has come and gone - Athol Trollip\n\nThe incumbent, James Selfe, has moved to a new governance position in the party to shore up the DA's work in the various metros where it governs.\n\nThe candidates to replace Selfe as DA federal council chairperson are Selfe's deputy Thomas Walters, federal executive chairperson Athol Trollip, former deputy chief whip Mike Waters, and Zille.\n\n'Many have sown divisions about Maimane'\n\nAddressing the issue of party leader Mmusi Maimane, Mcnwango said the information that was in the media was indeed a smear campaign, as previously claimed by Maimane.\n\n\"Everyone in the party has to account, even our leaders. Many have sown divisions in the media about him, but all in all, he was cleared of any wrongdoing. My call is that leaders must provide leadership.\"\n\nHe said the party needed strong leadership and tipped Trollip as a viable option for federal chairperson, to take the party into the run-up to the next local government elections in 2021.\n\n\"We need a strong centre and I believe he is the person who can provide this.\"\n\nHe added that race was not a determining factor for him in leadership.\n\n\"I hear discussions about the race. I don't care. My issue is attributes in terms of leadership and how they can take the party forward.\"", "description": "There is nothing wrong with Helen Zille's proposed return to DA leadership, KwaZulu-Natal party leader Zwakele Mncwango says,", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9331/15d48ad1760047c4a2bc8403fcfd93fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
