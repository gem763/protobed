The captain announced over the ship\u2019s public address system that the banners read, \u201cDown with U.S. Imperialism,\u201d \u201cDown with Nixon\u201d and \u201cDown with U.S. Navy war criminals.\u201d\n\nThe captain informed us that he had sent the Chinese a message in response to the banners, \u201cSince you are so down with everything, up yours!\u201d\n\nThe Chinese made no secret that America was their avowed enemy in 1971, and according to Bill Gertz\u2019s \u201cDeceiving the Sky: Inside Communist China\u2019s Drive for Global Supremacy,\u201d we remain their avowed enemy today.\n\nMr. Gertz, a Washington Times national security columnist and author of several books on intelligence, the military and national security threats, offers a sobering look at the growing threat from Communist China and its ambition to replace the United States as the world\u2019s No. 1 military and economic power in the world.\n\nIn \u201cDeceiving the Sky,\u201d a follow-up to Mr. Gertz\u2019s \u201cThe China Threat: How the People\u2019s Republic Targets America,\u201d which was published in 2000, Mr. Gertz notes that for more than 20 years, a willful blindness had descended over both Democratic and Republican administrations that operated on a false assumption: They believed that by simply conducting business with China, the Communist Chinese would eventually evolve into a free market and democratic system.\n\n\u201cToday, however, the failure of that decades-long policy has resulted in an expansive hard-line Communist regime headed by a supreme leader with unchecked powers matching those of Mao \u2014 General Secretary Xi Jinping,\u201d Mr. Gertz writes. \u201cThe new leader who took power in 2012 has ruled with an iron fist and made Communist ideology the centerpiece of a Chinese drive for world domination, not just China.\u201d\n\nHow that failure came about is the subject of \u201cDeceiving the Sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is steeped in ancient strategy, and the title, \u2018Deceiving the Sky,\u2019 comes from an ancient Chinese strategy used by generals to win battles called \u2018Deceive the sky to cross the ocean,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gertz explains.\n\nAccording to legend, Mr. Gertz tells us, an emperor was hesitant to launch a military campaign against neighboring Koguryo (now Korea). One of his generals had the emperor go to dinner at the home of a wealthy peasant. As the emperor entered the house, the house moved. The emperor had been tricked onto a boat headed for battle. Rather than disembark, he ordered the military campaign to go forward and the battle was won.\n\n\u201cFor Chinese Communist leaders, deceiving the sky is integral to masking true goals and intentions \u2014 first to achieve regional hegemony and ultimately world domination under the boot of the Communist Party of China,\u201d Mr. Getz writes. \u201cFor China today, the strategy reflects the Marxist maxim that the ends justify the means.\u201d\n\nThe author explains that it is another way of describing the Communist strategy of using all means of warfare against the United States \u2014 the sole obstacle to China becoming the most powerful nation on Earth.\n\nIn one chapter, Mr. Gertz recounts the Obama administration\u2019s disgraceful response to a Chinese official who was what is called in the intel game, a \u201cwalk-in.\u201d In the Chinese city of Chongqing, the city\u2019s vice mayor and a senior Chinese Communist Party security official named Wang Lijun entered the U.S. Consulate in 2012.\n\nHe had top-secret intelligence that he was willing to give America in return for asylum. But due to President Obama\u2019s policy of appeasing China, we handed him back to the Chinese to be imprisoned and perhaps killed, and we lost out on vital intelligence about the Chinese.\n\nThe book also details the Chinese military build-up, especially in space, and how Chinese spies who are stealing American corporate and government secrets aid that build-up. The book further describes how China is a technological totalitarian government that monitors their people to eliminate dissent, as well as the government\u2019s attempt to control the Internet.\n\nMr. Gertz describes President Trump as a powerful hawk on China who is adamant that dealing with the Chinese threat be among his highest priorities, so the tide is turning.\n\n\u201cDeceiving the Sky\u201d is a well-researched and well-written clarion call for the United States and other Western nations to truly understand Communist China\u2019s dangerous ambitions, and to take the necessary steps to counter China\u2019s evil empire.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nDECEIVING THE SKY: INSIDE COMMUNIST CHINA\u2019S DRIVE FOR GLOBAL SUPREMACY\n\nBy Bill Gertz\n\nEncounter Books, $25.99, 256 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
