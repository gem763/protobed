It is a pity to have to say it, but this is not a Prime Minister who can be trusted to comply with the law. And because he cannot be trusted he must be supervised. \u2014 Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) October 21, 2019\n\nThe case could also be made null if Parliament accepts the withdrawal deal brought to them by the Prime Minister.\n\nDavid Johnston QC, representing the UK Government, argued the appeal should be dismissed as the letter had been sent.\n\nThe court said it would return to the matter at a later date.\n\nDuring the case\u2019s first hearing on October 9, the Government\u2019s lawyers assured the court Mr Johnson would adhere to the law in writing and before the judges \u2013 despite the Prime Minister\u2019s repeated public declarations he would never request an extension.\n\nThe case was then postponed until after the deadline for the extension letter to be sent under the terms of the legislation.\n\nJudge Lord Carloway said the decision would be delayed under similar terms to those in previous hearing.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe court considers that the case should be continued until clear that the obligations under the 2019 Act have been complied with in full.\u201d\n\nEuropean Commission president Donald Tusk confirmed at 10pm on Saturday that he had received the Prime Minister\u2019s request, tweeting: \u201cThe extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\u201d\n\nIn his signed letter, Mr Johnson wrote: \u201cA further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\u201d\n\nThe letter, to Mr Tusk and copied to European Council president Jean-Claude Juncker, refers to his regret at being defeated over the Letwin amendment in the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nIt states: \u201cRegrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement.\u201d\n\nMPs voted by 322 to 306 in favour of amending the Brexit deal to withhold the Commons\u2019 approval until the necessary UK legislation to leave the EU has been passed.\n\nThe Government\u2019s response was to cancel Saturday\u2019s vote on the deal, with it expected to be brought back before MPs this week.", "description": "Petitioners now want to see if Boris Johnson will accept any potential extension granted by the EU.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/wire-19990322-1571661838-955_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
