The event takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nAfter he went 3-1 to kick off his UFC tenure, Anders lost three straight fights. In his most recent outing, Anders picked up a much-needed victory when he knocked Vinicius Moreira out inside the first round of their June contest.\n\nDespite his rollercoaster ride of an eight-fight UFC tenure to date, Anders said his confidence never falters. He enters every fight with the same mindset \u2013 he\u2019s going to win at all costs.\n\n\u201cMy confidence is forever unwavering,\u201d Anders told MMA Junkie. \u201cEach fight has a life of its own. The last one has nothing to do with the next one. It does feel good to go out there and get a win and three checks. It\u2019s a good deal.\n\n\u201cI expect to win and put in a lot of work and effort into this. When I go out there and compete, I expect to win. Just go out there and get the results. That\u2019s what you want in the fashion that you want them. I\u2019m happy about it.\u201d\n\nIn his UFC career, Anders hasn\u2019t faced an opponent with the submission resume of Meerschaert. The Roufusport product is known for his submission prowess and ability to finish a fight no matter which way the fight\u2019s momentum is swinging.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how the fights going for him, he\u2019s good at finishing and snatching up those submission,\u201d Anders said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy I can\u2019t take lightly, but will be happy to put away. I can\u2019t let him linger around. Because no matter what you do to him, no matter who he\u2019s fighting or how the fight is going, good or bad for him, he has a knack for catching that neck.\u201d\n\nWhile Meerschaert sports nine times the submission victories of his foe, Anders voiced his belief he can compete with anyone if the fight hits the ground.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super confident no matter where the fight takes place,\u201d Anders said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of submissions myself, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not knowledgeable or competent on the ground to avoid the submissions, catch the submissions of my own, or get back to my feet.\u201d\n\nWhen he envisions the fight, Anders sees nothing but victory. He said fans can expect to see what they always do when Eryk Anders steps into the UFC cage.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all are going to see what I get up to when I get in there to fight,\u201d Anders said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to end the fight and put on an entertaining fight for as long as it lasts and put him away with an impressive performance.\u201d", "description": "At UFC on ESPN+ 19, Eryk Anders will look to turn a win into a win streak when he takes on Gerald Meerschaert in Tampa.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Brian Garcia", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "George Garcia"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/eryk-anders-ufc-on-espn-3-pre.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
