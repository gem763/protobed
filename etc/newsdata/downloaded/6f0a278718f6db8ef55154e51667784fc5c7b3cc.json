Millions of us invest every month in companies that don\u2019t necessarily align with our values.\n\nWe may be putting cash every month through our pensions or other savings into oil companies, arms makers or other sectors that some people are uncomfortable with, and blithely give our money to companies whether or not they treat their staff fairly, hand out unjustified bonuses to complacent bosses or own up to huge gender pay gaps.\n\nWe wield such power as investors to shape our world. As much as \u00a363billion was invested last year in UK funds alone, according to the Investment Association. So imagine what would happen if we used our clout as a force for good.\n\nAs with other choices we make, there are ways of investing to reduce impact. There are funds, for example, that screen out any companies that invest in so-called sin stocks, often encompassing things like tobacco, arms or gambling.\n\nWe can ask questions of our pension providers \u2013 and then ask more if we don\u2019t like the answers.\n\nBut joyfully, in investing the focus doesn\u2019t have to be about reducing impact \u2013 it can be about maximising it.\n\nImpact investing is gaining momentum \u2013 the idea of protecting and growing money while making a positive contribution to the world \u2013 not just not doing harm, but actually doing good.\n\nSo alongside recycling diligently, for example, you could invest in a fund that puts money into companies that making better compostable materials, or improving recycling facilities.\n\nOr although you may have to drive, you could put money in a fund that invests in cleaner fuels or vehicles.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve only just begun. Just 15 per cent of investors have made an impact investment, according to a new survey from Barclays, but 56 per cent of investors say they are interested in exploring it further.\n\n\u2018Investors own businesses; we can have much more influence than is currently understood,\u2019 says Legal and General's Helena Morrissey. \u2018We can write our own future.\u2019", "description": "As consumers we endlessly battle to reduce our impact: take the train instead of driving, decline plastic straws, eat free range.
