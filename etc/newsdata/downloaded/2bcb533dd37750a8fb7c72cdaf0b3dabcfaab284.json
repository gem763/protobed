We Finally Think So.", "language": "en", "text": "HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.\n\nHuffPost You're not having a flashback. Flare jeans are having a moment.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve noticed a lot of new trends for fall 2019 fashion \u2014 20 of them in total, according to our fall fashion guide \u2014 the one common thread among them is that they aren\u2019t actually that new. Many of the season\u2019s top trends build on older styles that are making a comeback, just as Dr. Martens, which made their debut almost 60 years ago, resurfaced as one of the \u201cit shoes\u201d for fall and how the classic denim jacket has undergone countless redesigns for each decade.\n\nStill, there\u2019s one trouser trend we\u2019ve spotted that we think might finally be back for good, after years of speculation \u2014 but it\u2019s sure to spark some controversy. Flare jeans are kind of cool again? For real this time.\n\nIt seems that flare jeans are finally having their comeback moment. Every year people claim it\u2019s the year flares will return to the mainstream, but now we\u2019re no longer calling B.S. In fact, we\u2019re kind of into it.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t suggest tossing out all of your well-worn skinnies, the return of the flare jean is something we\u2019ve seen coming for a while now. The \u201970s silhouettes began shimmying their way back into our closets the moment we sidelined our jeggings and ribcage skinnies in favor of looser fitting wide-leg denim and mom jeans.\n\nBefore you cringe at the thought of \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d bell-bottoms and flower-child flares, there are actually a few ways to pull off this trend for the 21st Century. We asked Leighanne Jones, the director of creative merchandising for Free People, to dish on everything she knows about the flare jean trend and the best way to style them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the [flare jean] silhouette more than ever thanks to Fall\u2019s return to retro outfitting: rock-and-roll styling, edgy accents and undone ease,\u201d Jones told HuffPost.\n\nElloquii Flare jeans are back ... and better than ever.\n\nWhat do you wear with flare jeans?\n\n\u201cStyle your flares with a tuck-in top that\u2019s simple and sensual, letting the dramatic shape shine,\u201d Jones said. \u201cFor a sleek shape, try a never-budges bodysuit and waist-cinching belt that enhance and celebrate your curves.\u201d\n\nIf you really want to be on-trend, we recommend pairing wide-leg flares with some heeled snakeskin boots, a funky Western-inspired belt and a slouchy top with an effortless French tuck.\n\nSpecifically, what shoes do you wear with flare jeans?\n\n\u201cPair flares with a classic Western boot or a modern, chunky platform for sky-high height \u2014 perfect for floor-skimming styles,\u201d Jones said. We recommend a pair of chunky Dr. Martens for an edgier look, or even some knee-high boots for a sexier look.\n\nWhether it\u2019s in the form of a dramatic wide-leg or a subtle flutter, it\u2019s safe to say flare jeans will officially be back this Fall. If you don\u2019t know where to start, we\u2019ve rounded up a few styles of flare jeans that you can shop.\n\nTake a look below:\n\nBelow, some of the best flare jeans for fall 2019, from high-rise flares to plus-size styles:\n\n1 Olive Jean Reformation Find them for $128 at Reformation. 2 Good American Good Flare Ripped Jeans Nordstrom Find them for $107 at Nordstrom. 3 Just Float On Flare Jeans Free People Find them for $78 at Free People. 4 Ribcage Full Length Flare Women's Jeans Levis Find them for $98 at Levis. 5 AE NE(X)T LEVEL Curvy Highest Waist Flare Jean American Eagle Find them for $50 at American Eagle. 6 CRVY Utility Flare Jeans Free People Find them for $128 at Free People. 7 Leith High Waist Flare Jeans Nordstrom Find them for $42 at Nordstrom. 8 Highest Waist Flare Jean American Eagle Find them for $50 at American Eagle. 9 CRVY Wild Honey Cord Flare Pant Free People Find them for $98 at Free People. 10 Pilcro High-Rise Bootcut Corduroy Jeans Anthropologie Find them for $120 at Anthropologie. 11 Flare Leg Jean Eloquii.
