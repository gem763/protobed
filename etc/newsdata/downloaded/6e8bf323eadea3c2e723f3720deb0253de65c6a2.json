Add Interest\n\nChairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has already said the committee is conducting an impeachment investigation, but said Monday this move would more clearly define the parameters of the probe.\n\nIn a committee release on Monday, Nadler said the adoption of the procedures \u201cwill help ensure our impeachment hearings are informative to Congress and the public, while providing the President with the ability to respond to evidence presented against him. We will not allow Trump\u2019s continued obstruction to stop us from delivering the truth to the American people.\u201d\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP, FILE\n\n\u201cIt represents another significant step forward,\u201d a senior Judiciary aide said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question the committee is engaged in an investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment and these procedures are to guide that,\u201d another aide said.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe committee also announced Monday that President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski will testify on Sept. 17. Mueller\u2019s report describes Trump dictating a message to Lewandowski to give to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the special counsel\u2019s investigation to future election interference. As the Mueller reports states, Lewandowski never delivered the message and instead asked former deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn to do so.\n\nSources have told ABC News that Lewandowski would be willing to testify publicly before the committee but his attorney is encouraging him to speak only about his time working for Trump on the campaign, not about any conversations he had with Trump as president.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nAn aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is supportive of the committee\u2019s effort to expand its investigative powers, which Democrat leaders believe demonstrates the urgency of their investigation into the president to the courts.\n\nA growing numbers of Democrats believe time is running short on their ability to hold the president accountable for his actions and that has increased pressure on Pelosi and other party leaders.\n\nSusan Walsh/AP\n\nPelosi and Democrats see the case for impeachment expanding, working to pin constitutional violations on the president, according to a senior Democratic House leadership aide. As the case for impeachment continues to build and the presidential election draws near, Democrats are essentially pocketing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and moving onto what they view as less debatable indiscretions allegedly conducted by the president and administration, such as alleged violations of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause.\n\nVice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent stay at Trump\u2019s Doonbeg resort in Ireland is one example, and House Democrats are already looking into U.S. military personnel staying at the president\u2019s Turnberry property in Scotland \u2013 arguing that the president has enriched himself through his official office.\n\nWith just two cases of impeachment in the nation\u2019s history and only 31 words in the Constitution outlining the power of impeachment, a senior Democratic aide conceded there is no definitive blueprint for impeachment. While Judiciary Democrats are relying on precedent to largely shape their strategy, the case is complicated as time passes and they say the president continues to violate his oath of office.\n\nAs she returned to the Capitol after a six-week recess, Pelosi on Monday declined to discuss her latest thinking on impeachment, telling ABC News she was heading into a meeting to discuss the matter.\n\nTrump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News that the move toward impeachment shows \u201cDemocrats have always aimed to overturn the legitimate results of the 2016 election regardless of the facts or circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were counting on Robert Mueller and the Russia Hoax to provide them a reason to impeach, but that predictably fell apart, and now they just don\u2019t care why,\u201d Murtaugh noted. \u201cDemocrats are prisoners of their radical, fringe base and are willing to divide this nation in the most painful fashion possible in order to satisfy the most hate-filled partisans in their midst. President Trump just continues to do his job, advancing policies that have fueled the greatest economy Americans have ever seen.\u201d", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee votes Thursday on new impeachment procedures, representing Democrats' next step in determining whether to approve articles of impeachment.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nadler-meeting-gty-ps-190909_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
