Their valuations ballooned on big recent rounds of venture capital.\n\nPratt's pay day\n\nAfter Donald Trump slashed the corporate tax rate and granted instant write-offs for investment, Anthony Pratt grew pre-tax earnings 15 per cent to $1.26 billion. This put his family's valuation more than $1.5 billion clear of former list leaders Rinehart (No. 2) and Triguboff (No. 3).\n\nPratt's valuation was also fuelled by stronger price-to-earnings multiples for listed comparables like Amcor and Sonoco \u2013 not that his US-based Pratt Industries, or Australian cousin Visy, will ever be listed or sold while he has a say in it.\n\nA minimum net worth of $472 million would get you on to the list in 2019. All valuations are ruled off in the first week of April. Some Rich Listers have since become much richer: the Greensills have doubled their valuation following an investment in May from Japan\u2019s Softbank. Meanwhile, the Atlassian founders would be ranked in second and third spot given the recent rally in the company\u2019s share price.\n\nA change to the list\u2019s format in 2019 is the inclusion of families, which resulted in five new billionaire family entries: the daughters of Westfield co-founder John Saunders, the Buckeridges of BGC Construction fame, the Barro concrete kings, the Casella wine barons, and the Shahins of South Australian servo superiority. The founders of these businesses have died, but the Rich List team decided that if their descendants still owned the business and were working together in it, these pools of wealth were too big to ignore.\n\nThere are 26 women on this year's Rich List, up from 19 last year, although only a couple of these are new entrepreneurs: fitness phenomenon Itsines, and data marketplace builder Cyan Ta'eed. Most of the other new names are imports from what used to be the Rich Families List, while some, such as Hazel Rowe of Supercheap Auto fame, are getting overdue recognition for their hands-on role in building a business alongside their husband.\n\nThis year the Rich List includes the valuations of the 50 people who almost made the list: many of them are old-timers who have been overtaken by newer Rich Listers, but there are some up-and-comers who seem destined to crack the Rich 200 in the near future. Notable inclusions are former Macquarie CEO Nicholas Moore (valued at $401 million), golfer Greg Norman ($355 million) and F45 founder Rob Deutsch ($315 million).", "description": "Property remains the main vehicle by which fortunes are made.
