Now, details have emerged about an obsession she says she had with exercise.\n\nDemi, who is now 56, said she had an \u201cobsession with working out\u201d that started while she was training to play a naval lawyer in the 1992 movie A Few Good Men. Demi had recently given birth to her daughter Scout and was pushing herself to lose the baby weight.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I could stop exercising,\u201d she wrote, per People. \u201cIt was my job to fit into that unforgiving military uniform I\u2019d be wearing in two months in A Few Good Men. Getting in shape for that movie launched the obsession with working out that would consume me over the next five years. I never dared let up.\u201d\n\nDemi said that because she was doing \u201cexcessive exercising,\u201d there wasn\u2019t enough fat in her breast milk for Scout. And, as a result, her daughter wasn\u2019t growing the way she should. Scout\u2019s doctor urged Demi to supplement with formula. Demi said she was \u201ccrushed\u201d by the advice, but kept on working out at the same pace.\n\nAfter A Few Good Men, Demi started filming Indecent Proposal and again worried about her weight. \u201cI would be on display again, and all I could think about was my body, my body, my body,\u201d she said. \u201cI doubled down on my already over-the-top exercise routine. I cut out carbs, I ran and I biked and I worked out on every machine imaginable.\u201d\n\nDemi said she then contracted walking pneumonia and \u201ceased up a bit\u201d on her exercise routine, but she started up again when she began filming Striptease. \u201cWhen I was making Striptease, for breakfast I would measure out a half cup of oatmeal and prepare it with water, then for the rest of the day I would have only protein and some vegetables\u2014and that was it,\u201d she said. If all this obsessing about my body sounds crazy to you, you\u2019re not wrong: eating disorders are crazy, they are a sickness. But that doesn\u2019t make them less real.\u201d\n\nBut Demi had to change that when she made G.I. Jane the next year. Demi said that \u201cbulking up enormously\u201d to play a naval officer helped her break her disorders. She was 138 pounds at the end of the movie, which was above her usual weight, and she decided she was over dieting. \u201cMy usual reaction would have been to start starving myself again, to begin an exercise regime designed to reduce the bulk, but I did neither,\u201d she said. \u201cI had reached my limit. When I got home to Idaho, I had an epiphany in the shower one day: I just need to be my natural size.\u201d\n\nDemi said she eventually turned to meditation to help with her body image issues. \u201cI added into my daily prayer a new mantra: to have the courage to be seen without padding or protection. I couldn\u2019t go on fighting my body and my weight; I had to make peace,\u201d she said. \u201cI started by giving up hard exercise. I never went back into the gym in the house. Never. \u2026 The room it occupied is now my office.\u201d\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "\"All I could think about was my body, my body, my body.\"", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1ZR7i3081PNTLTkVcWyerA--~B/aD05OTk7dz0xOTk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/9c52a55e67fe8f5ee88e1152d08b2320", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
