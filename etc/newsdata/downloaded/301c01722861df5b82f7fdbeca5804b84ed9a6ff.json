First Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz navigated the crowded streets of Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thursday morning unaware that the United States was on the verge of a precarious peace deal with the Taliban that might end the longest war in American history \u2014 just as he was unaware that a suicide bomber hidden in the chaotic city traffic could upend the deal by aiming a car laden with explosives at the sergeant\u2019s truck.\n\nBut as Sergeant Barreto Ortiz, who was part of a driving team for covert special operations officers, neared a checkpoint in the neighborhood where Afghan national security authorities have offices, his unarmored Toyota SUV \u2014 meant to blend in with civilian traffic \u2014 was hit by a suicide car bomber. The explosion killed the sergeant, a Romanian army corporal and 10 Afghan civilians. The Taliban almost immediately claimed responsibility.\n\nLater that day, President Trump told his national security team he would not host talks with the Taliban immediately after the group had killed an American soldier, saying, \u201cThis is off; we can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday night, Mr. Trump said he had \u201ccalled off peace negotiations,\u201d adding on Monday that he alone had made the decision to cancel a meeting at Camp David. American officials have clarified that the deal had been neither rejected nor accepted.", "description": "President Trump said he called off negotiations with the Taliban after they claimed responsibility for the death of Sgt.
