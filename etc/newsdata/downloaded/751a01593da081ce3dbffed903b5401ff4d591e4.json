Fitch Affirms CBA's Mortgage Covered Bonds at 'AAA'/Stable\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Sydney-October 16: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (CBA, AA-/Negative/F1+) AUD25.9 billion of outstanding mortgage covered bonds at 'AAA'. The Outlook is Stable. This follows a periodic review of the covered bond programme. Commonwealth Bank of Australia ----senior secured, Mortgage Covered Bonds, Mortgage Covered Bonds; Long Term Rating; Affirmed; AAA; RO:Sta KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAA' rating of the mortgage covered bonds is based on CBA's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', the various uplifts above the IDR granted to the programme and the overcollateralisation (OC) protection provided through the programme's asset percentage (AP).The covered bonds are rated three notches above the bank's IDR. This is out of a maximum achievable uplift of seven notches, consisting of an IDR uplift of zero notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of six notches and a recovery uplift of one notch. For its analysis, Fitch relies on the programme's committed AP used in the Asset Coverage Test, which is expected to be revised to at least equal to Fitch's breakeven AP of 93.0%. The Stable Outlook reflects a four-notch buffer against an IDR downgrade. UpliftsThe IDR uplift remains unchanged at zero notches. There is no specific advanced resolution regime in Australia, but the regulator has the ability to resolve a bank under its regulatory powers pursuant to the Banking Act. Even so, covered bonds are not explicitly exempt from bail-in should a bank be resolved, which may result in the direct enforcement of recourse against the cover pool for the payment of the outstanding covered bonds. Therefore, CBA's Long-Term IDR remains the floor for its covered bond rating. The PCU remains unchanged at six notches and reflects the strength of liquidity protection in place in the form of a 12-month pre-maturity test on the hard-bullet bonds, which have a cure period of six months, and the 12-month extension period on the soft-bullet bonds, which make up the bulk of issuance. It also reflects three-month interest protection in the form of a reserve that will be funded upon the loss of CBA's Short-Term IDR of 'F1+'. While the issued hard-bullet bonds have less liquidity protection due to the six-month cure period, the likelihood of cross default caused by them is not considered likely by Fitch due to the size and distribution of the remaining hard-bullet bonds. They form a relatively small proportion of the liability profile, which continues to reduce as a result of maturity and further soft-bullet issuance. The recovery uplift on the rating is capped at one notch, as the programme is exposed to foreign-exchange risk from recoveries given default of the covered bonds. This is because the cover assets are denominated in Australian dollars, while about 90.0% of the covered bonds outstanding are denominated in other currencies. Swaps are in place on the liabilities, but we expect those swaps to terminate in a recovery scenario. 'AAA' Breakeven AP Fitch's revised 'AAA' breakeven AP of 93.0% corresponds to 7.5% 'AAA' breakeven OC, which allows the covered bonds to attain a 'AA+' rating on a probability-of-default (PD) basis and one-notch recovery uplift to 'AAA'. The ALM loss of 4.5% remains the largest component of the breakeven OC for the rating and reflects the modelled asset and liability mismatches, inclusive of the effect of the pro rata sales clause documented in the programme. The ALM loss has increased from 3.5% at previous analysis due to higher modelled maturity mismatches in the programme upon the worst-case issuer default timing, taking into account a high concentration of redemptions over a 12-month period from April 2021. This creates the need to sell more cover assets under our modelling, and has a negative impact on the programme's pro rata sales clause as it only allows the pro rata proportion of assets be sold for the liabilities being redeemed. The credit-loss component of 3.3% has gone up by 0.2% since the last analysis, driven by a lower cumulative weighted-average recovery rate (WARR) calculated by Fitch on the cover pool. Cover Pool Summary The cover pool consisted of 139,749 loans secured by first-ranking mortgages of Australian residential properties at end-September 2019, with a total outstanding balance of AUD31.2 billion. The weighted-average seasoning for the cover pool was 57.9 months. The weighted-average loan/value ratio for the cover pool was 57.1% and the Fitch-calculated consolidated weighted-average indexed loan/value ratio was 55.9%. Investment loans comprised 24.5% of the pool, while interest-only loans formed 15.5%. The cover pool is geographically diversified across Australia, with the largest concentrations in New South Wales (37.0%) and Victoria (28.5%). Fitch calculated that, in a 'AAA' scenario, there would be a cumulative weighted-average foreclosure frequency (WAFF) of 7.5% and a WARR of 50.7% (previously 52.1%) for the cover pool. The lower WARR figure is driven by a lower number of loans covered by lenders' mortgage insurance in the pool and a lower weighted-average residential property price index that Fitch used in its modelling, reflecting softening property prices. The results are driven by the 'AAA' minimum loss floor of 4.0%, as outlined in our criteria. These levels are mostly in line with Australian peers. In our review of the programme's loan-by-loan data and the underwriting of the mortgages by CBA held in the cover pool, Fitch selected a sample of loans based on adverse loan characteristics. In the review, four loans were found with data discrepancies, three of which were related to the loan security valuation. In these instances the data provided to Fitch were not the same as the source data in CBA's loan system. In all cases identified, the valuation data provided to Fitch were more conservative and as a result, Fitch has not made any further adjustment in our analysis for this review. We continue to liaise with CBA to resolve the loan-data discrepancies. The other loan information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio was considered satisfactory. RATING SENSITIVITIES CBA's 'AAA' covered bond rating would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the bank's IDR were to be downgraded by five or more notches to 'BBB' or below; or if the relied-upon AP provided less protection than Fitch's 'AAA' 93.0% breakeven AP. If the AP in the programme rises to the maximum 95% contractual AP stipulated in the programme documents, the rating on the covered bonds would fall to 'AA', one notch above the IDR. Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, among other factors, by the profile of the cover assets relative to the outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the 'AAA' breakeven AP, which maintains the covered bond rating, will remain stable over time. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The source of information used to assess these ratings was CBA. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated bonds is public. PUBLIC RATINGS WITH CREDIT LINKAGE TO OTHER RATINGS The covered bond ratings are driven by the credit risk of the issuing financial institution as measured by its Long-Term IDR.
