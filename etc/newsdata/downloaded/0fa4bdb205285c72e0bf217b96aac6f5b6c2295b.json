It also has been at pains to distance democratic and economically successful Bolivia from the leftists in Venezuela, who have been accused of fraud and violence in their quest to cling to power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as the tallies from Sunday\u2019s election appeared to be swinging in Morales\u2019s favor after an irregular period in which vote counting had been halted, critics said the election was in danger of losing legitimacy. Bolivia, meanwhile, was at risk of being seen as exactly what it has insisted it isn\u2019t: another Venezuela.\n\nCounting of the last ballots is ongoing, and no official winner has been announced, but state TV was suggesting an outright victory for Morales. On Monday evening, the electoral authorities announced that with 95 percent of the ballots counted, Morales was winning with 47 percent of the votes \u2014 just fractionally enough to avoid a runoff against opposition candidate and former president Carlos Mesa.\n\nThose results were a far cry from the initial vote-count result released after polls closed Sunday. That count showed Morales ahead but significantly short of the 10-percentage point lead he needed to avoid a runoff in December, which experts say he stood a strong chance of losing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe turn of events set off violent protests in several Bolivian cities. In Potosi, protesters lighted the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) building on fire, leading two people on the second floor to jump to safety. Protesters also set fire to an election office building in Chuquisaca, leaving at least three injured. In Sucre and Tarija, demonstrators burned and looted election offices.\n\nOvernight, thousands of protesters took to the streets across the nation, chanting slogans such as \u201cNo, and no, I don\u2019t want to live in a dictatorship like the one in Venezuela.\u201d At one point, protesters tore down a statue of Ch\u00e1vez in Riberalta, a town northeast of La Paz, Bolivia\u2019s seat of government.\n\nA civil society group in Santa Cruz, the economic capital and an opposition stronghold, called for a national strike on Tuesday and invited the business community and agriculture workers to meet to discuss the possibility of calling for a permanent strike should Morales be proclaimed the outright victor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, an Organization of American States observer mission made up of representatives from across the region expressed \u201cworry and surprise about the drastic and hard to justify change in the tendency of the preliminary results.\u201d\n\nThe United States \u2014 which had joined more than 50 countries in pulling official recognition from Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor \u2014 denounced the election results in Bolivia, suggesting manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. rejects the Electoral Tribunal\u2019s attempts to subvert #Bolivia\u2019s democracy by delaying the vote count & taking actions that undermine the credibility of Bolivia\u2019s elections,\u201d tweeted Michael G. Kozak, acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. \u201cWe call on the TSE to immediately act to restore credibility in the vote counting process.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMorales\u2019s opposition, meanwhile, decried the vote count as fraudulent.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Bolivia is a gigantic fraud to rob us of our right to go to a second round, where we have a choice of winning,\u201d Mesa told CNN in an interview on Monday night. \u201cWe are talking about a clearly established fraud by a government that has the electoral council at its service.\u201d\n\nProminent Latin American observers said Bolivia would be entering dangerous territory if Morales is declared the outright victor, a move that could lead to international condemnation and perhaps even sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe electoral process has been bizarre and highly suspect,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIt is hard to escape the conclusion that Evo is brazenly trying to steal the election to avoid a runoff that he might well lose. He is intent on perpetuating himself in power. He sees himself as Bolivia\u2019s savior who deserves another term.\u201d\n\nKathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a think tank analyzing Bolivian politics and drug policy, said moves by protesters to attack and burn vote-counting centers could hinder a fair count. By the same token, she said, the decision by the electoral tribunal to suspend vote counting for 20 hours after Morales appeared to be heading to a runoff and then suddenly announce results that appeared to show him winning outright also strains faith in the electoral process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what happened because of the erratic and nontransparent way in which the electoral tribunal froze voting results,\u201d Ledebur said. \u201cAt this point, it almost doesn\u2019t matter. There is an uncertainty, and the road from here on out is going to be rocky and complicated for everyone involved. In this situation, all Bolivians lose.\u201d\n\nMorales was running for a fourth term in office despite losing a 2016 referendum in which he sought a national mandate to sidestep term limits. He secured a court ruling that enabled him to run again anyway \u2014 drawing fire from opponents, who said it fit an authoritarian pattern that has also included heavy-handedness with anti-development demonstrators, the press and political opponents.\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Morales \u2014 Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president \u2014 handily won reelection in 2009 and 2014 based on his economic successes. But this time around, polls suggested that many Bolivians had soured on Morales, viewing him as out-of-touch and distant. He was losing his shine amid allegations of government corruption, a slowing economy and an undemocratic power grab, even as many Bolivians have acknowledged the economic benefits brought during his 13 years of governance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday evening, after a count based on 83 percent of the vote showed Morales almost surely headed to a runoff, he nevertheless proclaimed a \u201cnew victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cA new victory. We won again. Four consecutive elections we have won in Bolivia,\u201d Morales said at his party\u2019s headquarters. \u201cAnd the most important thing is that we again have an absolute majority in the chambers of deputies and senators.\u201d\n\nRachelle Krygier in Miami and Lucien Chauvin in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "After an irregular period in which vote counting was halted, state TV suggested an outright victory for Morales.", "authors": ["Anthony Faiola", "Correspondent Covering Latin America", "Venezuela", "Argentina", "Brazil", "Human Rights", "Poverty", "Globalization"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dwFg-LkbuADMUuy3MF7D7zsezsQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKPTCEHU3QI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
