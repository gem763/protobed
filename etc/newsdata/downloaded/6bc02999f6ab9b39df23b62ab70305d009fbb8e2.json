Michelin said that its volume declined 0.8% during the period due to a weaker-than-expected market.\n\nMichelin confirmed its 2019 guidance but lowered its market forecast for its fourth quarter. \"Truck tire markets are expected to weaken more quickly in the fourth quarter, to end the year down 4%,\" Michelin said, adding that \"the full-year impact of raw materials costs and customs duties is estimated at around a negative EUR100 million.\"\n\nWrite to Olivia Bugault at olivia.bugault@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 12:14 ET (16:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
