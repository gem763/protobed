But he needed money, so as a favor, I bought them,\" Paul Martino tells me. \"Then it became kind of an intellectual challenge of trying to do something I'd never done before. I went on Amazon and filled my cart with three books about how to make a movie.\"\n\nThe result is Inside Game, which hits over 150 theaters nationwide in November. Trailer here.\n\nWhat's next: Expect a major media blitz to begin late this month, including appearances by the real-life Tommy Martino (played in the film by Scott Wolf) and disgraced referee Tim Donaghy (played by Eric Mabius).\n\n\"It's the startup rule about how you need a lucky break no matter how smart or qualified you are. Mine was at my 15th high school reunion, when I met a friend's husband who was a Hollywood screenwriter. He told me his team had beaten Kobe Bryant's team twice in high school, and wanted to write it.\"\n\n\u2014 Paul Martino\n\nBut, but, but: Martino was on the board of FanDuel. The NBA also was an early investor, with the league's general counsel serving as its original board observer.\n\nMartino resigned from the FanDuel board once Inside Game went into production, believing that the dual-roles could bring unwanted scrutiny to the company, which already was under all sorts of media pressure.\n\n\"I don't think there's a pure cause and effect between the NBA scandal and sports betting startups, but it's in the same pond... Once [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver came out publicly in support of legalization, you'll remember he said they'd also want integrity fees. That was so there wouldn't be another Tim Donaghy.\"", "description": "He's making a movie about his cousin, who served time for his role in the NBA's game-fixing scandal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/fP0U_w_x95EPQzvcvngIlkTjhM0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/11/1570802474367.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
