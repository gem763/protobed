The move came a few days after President Trump announced that American troops in the area would be withdrawn to allow the Turkish incursion to move forward. American soldiers had been in the region to support Kurdish forces, who have been a key ally in the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sees the Kurds as a threat and has sought to push them back from his country\u2019s southeastern border. He also wants to resettle millions of refugees who crossed into Turkey during Syria\u2019s brutal civil war. The presence of American soldiers had been a factor in maintaining a tenuous peace in the area among the Kurds, Turkey and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nTrump\u2019s abrupt decision was met with intense pushback, even from members of his own party. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump had \u201cshamelessly abandoned\u201d a key partner in the war on terror. Trump\u2019s former envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS Brett McGurk said the move was a sign that the president is \u201cnot a Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. troops raised a number of serious concerns among experts of the Syrian conflict. Chief among them is the threat that the Kurds, a critical ally in the fight against terror, might be slaughtered as Turkey\u2019s formidable army moves through their territory. Trump\u2019s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, said the U.S. was \u201cleaving them to die.\u201d Others fear that the Kurds may be forced to align themselves with forces working counter to American interests \u2014 such as Russia, Iran or the Assad regime \u2014 to avoid this fate.\n\nThere is also major concern that the move might lead to a resurgence of ISIS. With Kurdish forces preoccupied by potential conflict with Turkey, some experts worry that nascent Islamic State groups that had been beaten back after years of fighting could regain a foothold in territory they\u2019ve lost in recent years. Others fear the humanitarian impact of resettling millions of refugees in an increasingly unstable area of Syria.\n\nThere are some \u2014 though they\u2019re in the minority \u2014 who are in favor of the decision, even if they may disagree with how it was carried out. American soldiers were being put at risk to prop up an unsustainable d\u00e9tente, they argue, and any effort to draw down U.S. activities in the Middle East should be celebrated.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nTurkey has faced diplomatic pressure on many fronts to halt its advance or at least avoid open conflict. Trump warned that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Erdogan\u2019s forces did anything that he deemed to be \u201coff limits,\u201d though he didn\u2019t specify what those limits might be. Officials from Russia, Iran and the European Union have also urged caution.\n\nOn Tuesday, ISIS reportedly carried out a series of suicide attacks in Raqqa, a city that once served as the group\u2019s de facto capital in Syria. Whether these attacks were isolated incidents or a sign of an emergent Islamic State remains to be seen.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nTrump\u2019s decision undermines the entirety of the U.S. mission in the Middle East\n\n\u201c...the speed of his decision to withdraw US forces from northern Syria threatens to wreck almost every goal the US has in the Middle East just now.\u201d \u2014 Nick Paton Walsh, CNN\n\nThe departure of American forces creates a power vacuum that could lead to chaos\n\n\u201cIf you leave \u2026 then we\u2019re going to leave the vacuum for more sectarian conflict, for more instability, for a breeding ground for terrorism. It\u2019s going to be ugly. It\u2019s going to hit Israel the hardest for sure.\u201d \u2014 Hagar Chemali, MSNBC\n\nISIS will reemerge without Kurdish forces to hold it back\n\n\u201cAmong the camp detainees are hard-wired ideologues who would be central to an Isis resurgence if given the chance. The spectre of a jihadist juggernaut once again roaming the plains of Iraq and Syria after using captivity to regroup \u2026 now hangs heavy over a region still grappling with the seismic regional power shifts that have defined Trump\u2019s three turbulent years in office.\u201d \u2014 Martin Chulov, The Guardian", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of parts of Syria has led to concerns that it may lead to Kurdish fighters in the area being slaughtered and a revival of ISIS.
