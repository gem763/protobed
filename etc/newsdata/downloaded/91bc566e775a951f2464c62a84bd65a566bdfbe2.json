What is profane is a 17-month-old baby being shot in the face.\u201d Point taken, but note that he would not have said the same thing in reference to the N-word. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cF-bomb,\u201d then, was less a matter of swearing than his seeking a note of sincerity. The F-word these days may not be truly profane to many of us, but it remains potent, a way of indicating genuine feeling. That is a common note from O\u2019Rourke, paralleled by his display of his Spanish-speaking skills during the first Democratic debate in June. Related to this sincerity is that his F-bomb was downright articulate: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know what the motivation is \u2026 but we do know this is fucked up.\u201d The word untenable would have sounded too formal; problematic too weak; troubling too uncommitted; egregious too Mr. Mooney. \u201cFucked up,\u201d combining pungency with a streak of impatient dismissiveness, conveys exactly the sentiment O\u2019Rourke intended, as well as precisely the one his supporters share.\n\nEventually, but evidently not yet, our formal understanding of profanity will catch up with reality, and it will seem as silly to write \u201cthe F-word\u201d as it seems now that Pinafore\u2019s captain refers to a \u201cD___.\u201d At that point, dropping the F-bomb on the campaign trail will attract about as much attention as dropping the D-bomb. In other words, no attention at all. Slurs are our real profanity today. Beyond those slurs, we might take a page from George Carlin and consider that words only have the power to shock because we give them that power.", "description": "", "authors": ["John Mcwhorter", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Who-Cares-Beto-Swore"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
