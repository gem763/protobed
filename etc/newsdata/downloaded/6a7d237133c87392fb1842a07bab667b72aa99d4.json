The filmmakers even went as far as to institute a \u201cspoiler ban\u201d for members of the cast doing interviews, and to ban filming with phones on set. The former measure mostly worked, excluding for Mark Ruffalo, whose Hulk-like desire to give away plot points of these movies simply cannot be contained. The latter measure, however, was less successful, as it seems like basically everyone wanted mementos of their time on set, including directors Joe and Anthony Russo themselves. We\u2019d previously seen some \u201cillegal\u201d behind-the-scenes footage from Chris Pratt, but now that the aforementioned spoiler ban has been lifted, more and more clips and photos are popping up online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s Ruffalo and Chris Hemsworth showing off some new hairdos, with Ruffalo giving off strong Robert Smith vibes.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Hemsworth feeling the rhythm at a mariachi party thrown by Robert Downey Jr. for whatever reason.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russos gave us some footage of archery training down at the ol\u2019 Barton ranch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Robert Downey Jr. shared an unused reunion scene between Tony Stark and Tom Holland\u2019s Peter Parker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears, however, that no one shot as much footage as Chris Evans, who definitely seems like he was savoring his time on set with the gusto of someone who knew this was the last time he\u2019d be doing this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat this was quite probably the last time this particular collection of Avengers will ever assemble does not seem lost on the cast. Though Marvel might not love the fact that basically no one in the cast had any respect at all for their filming ban, the resulting footage is a whole lot of fun to watch.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Great Job, Internet tips to gji@theonion.com", "description": "[Spoilers for Avengers: Endgame below.]", "authors": ["Gabe Worgaftik", "About The Author", "Contributor", "The A.V.
