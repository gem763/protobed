To add insult to injury, lawmakers then refused to approve an early general election, which Johnson had pushed for in an effort to increase his waning support.\n\nIn short, it was a bad day for Boris.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a political death sentence. He might even eventually win.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\nWhile Wednesday\u2019s votes got the ball rolling on another Brexit delay and on preventing a no-deal Brexit, neither outcome has been written in stone.\n\nInstead, the attention now turns to the unelected House of Lords.\n\nWhile the upper house of Parliament is expected to confirm the House of Commons\u2019 decision to reject a no-deal Brexit, every day oit debates is a day Johnson is not being thrown out of office \u2014 and another day closer to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. And it looks like the House of Lords may be chattering through the weekend.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/f2/7f/e5fc75d54c00b03553716e940a58/a01416f4568446e69bb5c4eb0285776c\" true\n\nThat gives Johnson\u2019s opponents a reason to approve that election sooner rather than later \u2014 a step they rejected today.\n\nParliament is suspended for five weeks starting Monday, putting the pressure on opposition parties to call the election or risk winding up with exactly what they\u2019re trying to avoid: a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, a prime minister they hate and a shredded set of constitutional conventions.\n\nWhat would an election actually accomplish?\n\n\n\nIn short, all sides need an election to help resolve Britain\u2019s Brexit conundrum.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, every level of the country is divided. Scotland and Northern Ireland oppose Brexit; England and Wales support it. Cities back the EU, towns and villages back Brexit. Older age groups want out, young Brits are determined to stay in. Anything short of a national election leaves the country stuck in that rut.\n\nIn Parliament, rebels displayed strength this week in defeating Johnson, but it\u2019s been a long time coming. Members of Parliament still don\u2019t know what sort of Brexit they support, despite a deal being on the table for nine months already. An election could help guide them.\n\nAnd at the EU, officials need another U.K. election to figure out who they\u2019re supposed to negotiate with. Neither Johnson nor opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn commands the support of Parliament. And when the man in Downing Street talks about the contours of a new deal, he doesn\u2019t follow through with specifics for the EU to seriously consider.\n\nSo what\u2019s the holdup?\n\n\n\nWhile an election offers the best chance for resolution, it also risks running the U.K. into another dead end.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, maybe even likely, that voters would send large delegations from five parties to Parliament, further fragmenting it.\n\nIf that happens, get ready to learn another delightful British phrase: the hung Parliament. That\u2019s where no party can form a government on its own, and must instead resort to a coalition government that spans geographies and ideologies.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

We would know if Johnson really does have a mandate to pursue Brexit at any cost.\n\nWhat are the chances Boris gets his mandate?\n\n\n\nJohnson does have several significant advantages in an election.\n\nChief among them is that his main rival, Corbyn, is not very popular. In the 10 most recent national opinion polls, Corbyn\u2019s average disapproval rating was in the mid-60s, compared with Johnson\u2019s at around 40 percent.\n\nJohnson has also boosted his party\u2019s support levels in opinion polls since winning the keys to Downing Street. Conservatives now poll at an average of 34 percent, compared to 28 percent the week Johnson took over, according POLITICO\u2019s poll of polls.\n\nCorbyn is deeply distrusted by right-leaning voters because of his severe socialist policy prescriptions. And, as a long-term EU critic \u2014 who is committed to supporting the Brexit referendum result \u2014 he also frustrates many of the 16 million Britons who voted to stay in the EU. Corbyn\u2019s team is also decimated after dozens of senior and moderate MPs resigned in recent years, and it\u2019s a bit battered after facing recent complaints of anti-semitism. It\u2019s easy to see Corbyn stumbling in an election campaign.\n\nKnowing that, Johnson is free to deal with the political threat to his right: Brexit purists, who rally around Nigel Farage and his new Brexit Party. Johnson has been dialing up rhetoric around the need to avoid \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201crunning up the white flag,\u201d knowing that heroic language helps peel voters away from the Brexit Party, which has slumped to 12 percent since he took office.\n\nSo while things are going to look very bad for Johnson for a while, he\u2019s hoping and planning for political fortune to swing dramatically his way in October. If it does, Johnson\u2019s high-stakes Brexit gamble could have his fans comparing him to that other charismatic British blowhard who suffered a thousand defeats before winning the war: his hero, Winston Churchill.", "description": "The British prime minister lost every vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday, but an election could save him yet.", "authors": ["Ryan Heath"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bc/31/62dcaf694ef98ddc42aae64d73dd/20190904-boris-johnson-solo-gty-773.jpg"}
