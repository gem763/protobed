I don't know if it was the film company or the hire company, but someone reported the van.\n\n'Sniffer dogs from a bomb disposal unit were sent in to investigate immediately.

But spymaster M \u2013 played by Ralph Fiennes \u2013 calls him back in desperation to tackle a new global crisis.\n\nA movie insider said: 'There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says 'Come in 007', and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman.\n\n'It's a popcorn-dropping moment. Bond is still Bond but he's been replaced as 007 by this stunning woman.\n\n'Bond, of course, is sexually attracted to the new female 007 and tries his usual seduction tricks, but is baffled when they don't work on a brilliant, young black woman who basically rolls her eyes at him and has no interest in jumping into his bed. Well, certainly not at the beginning.'\n\nThe source added that the phrase 'Bond girls' is now forbidden, saying: 'We were all told that from now on they are to be addressed as 'Bond women'.'\n\nDr Swann and Bond's romance, sparked in Spectre, appears to still be going strong in No Time To Die, with the pair sharing a passionate kiss during filming last week.\n\nNo Time To Die has a UK release date of April 3, 2020, and opens in the US on April 8, 2020.\n\nThe countdown is on: No Time To Die has a UK release date of April 3, 2020, and opens in the US on April 8, 2020", "description": "It was reported on Saturday that Daniel Craig's final outing as 007 will see the character tie the knot with\u00a0Madeleine Swann, played by\u00a0L\u00e9a Seydoux.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland", "Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231598-0-image-a-65_1572139631646.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
