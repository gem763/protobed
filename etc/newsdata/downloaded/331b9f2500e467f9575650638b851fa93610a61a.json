A botnet is a chain of computers that has been co-opted using malicious code. Hackers use these networks of computers to help them launch various attacks, including mass spam campaigns and DDoS attacks meant to overload servers and imperil an entities infrastructure. According to Norton Security: 'A botnet is nothing more than a string of connected computers coordinated together to perform a task. That can be maintaining a chatroom, or it can be taking control of your computer.' - Norton\n\n'This may not sound like a lot, but for a low maintenance operation requiring only a large credentials list and the occasional wallet replacement, this generates $22,000 per month,' writes Check Point.\n\nThe group responsible for the attacks has been identified by researchers as Phorpiex, which engages in several similar types of schemes.\n\nPhorpiex's method of hijacking computers to export blackmail en masse helps the group to remain undetected, since they're able to send thousands of emails from many computers instead of just one machine that would likely be flagged as spam.\n\n'Sextortion' scams like the one launched by Phorpiex have seen a dramatic rise in recent years with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.\n\nIn 2018, the arm reported a 242 percent rise in the number of extortion emails with most of them being of the 'sextortion' variety.", "description": "According to security researchers from Check Point, the bot net, which consisted of 450,000 hijacked computers, was built to black mail victims by threatening to release their alleged nude video.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19846374-0-image-a-8_1571327958402.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
