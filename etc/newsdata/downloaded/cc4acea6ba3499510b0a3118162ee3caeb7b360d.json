She received $100,000.\n\nShe later accused Weinstein of raping her and has been one of his most vocal critics and a political firebrand in the #MeToo movement.\n\nBloom dropped Weinstein as a client just days after the initial bombshell reports about him were released, and apologized for ever representing him.\n\nWeinstein has since been accused of impropriety by more than 80 women as both the Times and The New Yorker detailed decades of allegations against him as he rose to stratospheric heights in Hollywood. He will face trial next year in New York for claims of predatory sexual assault related to some of those accounts.\n\nFollowing the Times\u2019 article about \u201cShe Said\u201d on Sunday, Bloom issued a renewed apology on Twitter.\n\nThe attorney said that the detailed reports in 2017 of the allegations against Weinstein forced her to \u201cconfront the colossal mistake\u201d she made working for the man. She asked critics to look towards her \u201cthree decades fighting mostly for underdogs against the powerful\u201d rather than her recent work.\n\n\u201cWhen the first woman went on record accusing him of sexual assault, I immediately resigned and apologized, but that was not enough,\u201d Bloom wrote on Twitter, saying she moved her law firm to be \u201c100%\u201d on the side of victims. \u201cTo those who missed my 2017 apology, and especially to the women, I apologize again.\u201d\n\nWhile painful, I learn so much more from my mistakes than my successes.\n\n\n\nTo those who missed my 2017 apology, and especially to the women: I am sorry.\n\n\n\nHere are the changes I've made to ensure that I will not make that mistake again. pic.twitter.com/FSSl3qrFjQ \u2014 Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) September 8, 2019\n\nMcGowan did not appear to offer up forgiveness on Sunday, writing on social media that the \u201cevil that was perpetrated on me and others was mind bending and illegal.\u201d\n\nShe went a step further, saying Bloom should be disbarred for her behavior.\n\nThe evil that was perpetrated on me and others was mind bending and illegal. Lisa Bloom should be disbarred @yashar https://t.co/kpqkM2JKhS \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) September 8, 2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand what was done to me and how systematic it was. They\u2019ve called me mentally unbalanced, a whore, an attention seeker, a TERF,\u201d McGowan wrote on Facebook this weekend. \u201cAll I have done is for the greater good of the world. I\u2019d like people to stop shitting on me. To stop making fun of me. To stop buying into the narrative.
