The ministry is in charge of licensing and censoring foreign films.\n\n\u201cAbominable\u201d, about a Chinese girl who discovers a yeti living on her roof, was jointly produced by Shanghai-based Pearl Studio and Comcast-owned DreamWorks Animation and was first shown in Vietnamese cinemas on Oct. 4.\n\nIt was removed from cinemas on Sunday after images of the scene with the offending map were shared widely on social media.\n\nA spokeswoman for CJ CGV Vietnam, Vietnam\u2019s largest cinema chain and a unit of South Korea\u2019s CJ CGV, declined to comment.\n\nA receptionist at the state-run National Cinema Center in Hanoi said the culture ministry had issued an order requiring all Vietnamese cinemas to stop showing the film because of the map scene.\n\nCalls to Nguyen Thu Ha, the head of the culture ministry\u2019s cinema department, went unanswered on Monday.\n\nIn August, police broke up a brief protest outside the Chinese embassy in Hanoi over the operations of a Chinese survey vessel in the disputed waters.\n\nVietnam has repeatedly accused the vessel and its escorts of violating its sovereignty and has demanded that China remove its ships from the area.", "description": "Vietnam has pulled the animated DreamWorks film \"Abominable\" from cinemas over a scene featuring a map which shows China's unilaterally declared \"nine-dash line\" in the South China Sea, state media reported on Monday.", "authors": ["Khanh Vu", "Phuong Nguyen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
