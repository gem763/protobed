It matched the feat again last year, and expects to meet the target in 2019 too. Once the most recent deals have been signed, Google\u2019s supply agreements with renewable energy developers will total 5.5GW.\n\nPichai said the latest package of deals will \u201cspur the construction of more than $2bn in new energy infrastructure\u201d, including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across three continents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not buying power from existing wind and solar farms, but instead are making long-term purchase commitments that result in the development of new projects,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cBringing incremental renewable energy to the grids where we consume energy is a critical component of pursuing 24x7 carbon-free energy for all of our operations,\u201d Pichai added.\n\nAlmost half of Google\u2019s new renewable energy investments will be made in Europe, including projects in Finland, Sweden, Belgium and Denmark.\n\nThe deal includes investment in the US states of North Carolina, South Carolina and Texas, as well as a smaller contract in South America to power a Google data centre in Chile.", "description": "Tech giant\u2019s push for greener energy prompts biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e44dc46be8d45fc086062d41b32477ffb14783ee/0_82_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f31fa8f24d90a1de7891f622e170a93b", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
