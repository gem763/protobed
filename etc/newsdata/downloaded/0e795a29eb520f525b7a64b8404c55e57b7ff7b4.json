Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs - RC16548097A0/File Photo\n\nThe Australian can also be as stubborn as a mule and once he makes his mind up about a player, he rarely changes it \u2014 as Alex Goode, Danny Cipriani and many others routinely delivering man of the match performances for their clubs but left in the international wilderness have found to their cost.\n\nHis insistence on describing replacements as \u201cfinishers\u201d is widely mocked but Jones really does believe a match is won by 23 players rather than 15 and that some better suit the early stages and some thrive later and he has little patience with anyone who dares question that view.\n\nThe 59-year-old Jones makes no secret of the fact that he sees the media as just another tool in his armoury to improve his team\u2019s chances of success and is spectacularly unconcerned about criticism of his selections.\n\nHe usually explains his choices by saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing what I\u2019m seeing day in day out in camp,\u201d and loves an analogy to help the hapless hacks see the light.\n\nIn the first months of his England tenure, when press and public demanded the inclusion of tyro lock Maro Itoje, Jones warned that the then-21-year-old was still at the Vauxhall Viva stage and needed to be a BMW before earning a starting berth.\n\nA bemused Itoje said he had to do a Google search to discover that the Viva was a particularly unremarkable 1970s small family saloon, but weeks later he was in the Six Nations starting team and has not looked back.\n\nDuring that same 2016 Six Nations Jones raised eyebrows \u2014 and some southern hemisphere hackles \u2014 by suggesting Billy Vunipola could be the best number eight in the world. It seemed fanciful at the time but, three years on, he just might be.\n\n\u201cAs a coach one of your jobs is to give them dreams,\u201d Jones said at the time. Vunipola added: \u201cI respond more to the love and compassion he shows the boys, me especially. He has just filled me with confidence and that is something I thrive on. I just need someone to reassure me and look after me.\u201d\n\nThat is not a side of Jones\u2019s persona that the former roughhouse hooker likes to promote but, behind closed doors, he is clearly a master motivator.\n\nRUGBY SHOCKS\n\nThat ability to inspire \u2014 alongside implementing a meticulously researched game plan \u2014 was at its most tangible when his Japan team pulled off one of the all-time rugby shocks by beating South Africa in the 2015 World Cup.\n\nPreviously, Jones had been an assistant with the Springboks when they triumphed in 2007, having seen his Australia team come up agonisingly short against England four years earlier.\n\nNow he is devoting his famously exhausting work ethic to England \u2014 saying on the day he took over from Stuart Lancaster after the 2015 failure that his entire focus was on winning the 2019 tournament.\n\nIf people thought England coach Clive Woodward\u2019s preparations were meticulous in 2003, Jones has taken things to a new level as he has brought in countless external advisors, experts and motivators \u2014 from within rugby and without \u2014 and driven RFU staff to exhaustion with his demands.\n\nHe has made the squad operate on short turnarounds, hop between training bases and has even introduced a deliberately late stadium arrival to replicate known and possible scenarios in Japan.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he has also applied that same forensic approach to what is happening on the pitch \u2014 constantly trying to adapt personnel and tactics to stay up with the ever-changing interpretation of the laws by referees and the world governing body.\n\nWhen he had only two warm-up games left in which to tinker, Jones took the radical approach of playing twin opensides Tom Curry and Sam Underhill against Ireland \u2014 with great success as it turned out.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more contest in the breakdown now. The tackler is being allowed to stay in the tackle which means the ability to poach has increased and so I think that this is definitely potentially an option for us,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt is all having different ways to play and we need to be prepared for everything at a World Cup.\u201d", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones can be warm, charming, engaging, witty and also willing to share his immense rugby insights when it suits his purpose to do so.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428981359&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0FJ-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
