Never,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. \u201cThis raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct.\u201d\n\nSchiff indicated that he learned the matter involved \u201cpotentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community,\u201d raising the specter that it is \u201cbeing withheld to protect the President or other Administration officials.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
