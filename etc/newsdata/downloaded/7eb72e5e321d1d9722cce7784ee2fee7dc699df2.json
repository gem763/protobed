The US government filed a similar claim that year over European subsidies to Airbus.\n\nWednesday's ruling, which will affect less than 2% of the value of total EU exports to the United States, could further inflame trade tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nIf the United States goes ahead with the tariffs, which seems likely, Europe will retaliate.\n\nThe top EU trade official said that the bloc had shared proposals with the United States as recently as July for \"a new regime on aircraft subsidies,\" but had so far received no response.\n\n\"Our readiness to find a fair settlement remains unchanged,\" EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m said in a statement. \"But if the US decides to impose ... countermeasures, it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have no other option than do the same.\"\n\nfrom across the European Union. The Trump administration had initially proposed tariffs of up to 100% on $25 billion of European items, including new aircraft from France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom -\u2014 all countries where Airbus has production sites . Cheeses such as Parmesan and Gouda were on the original list of target products, which also included wines and meats, olive oil, olives and pastafrom across the European Union.\n\nThe list of goods that the United States now plans to hit with tariffs is expected to be published later Wednesday or Thursday, the senior US Trade Representative official said. Aircraft will be subject to a 10% tariff, and a variety of other goods with be subject to a 25% tariff.\n\nIn the coming months, the WTO will determine the amount of countermeasures the European Union can impose on US products because of unfair subsides to Boeing.\n\nIf both sides elect to impose tariffs, this \"would only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic, and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time,\" Malmstr\u00f6m added.\n\nAirbus reiterated calls for talks, saying tariffs would be a \"barrier against free trade,\" and negatively affect airlines, travelers and jobs in the United States.\n\n\"Airbus is therefore hopeful that the US and the EU will agree to find a negotiated solution before creating serious damage to the aviation industry as well as to trade relations and the global economy,\" CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement.\n\nTransatlantic trade is already facing increased friction. The US has imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum exports.\n\nThe EU retaliated with tariffs on more than $3 billion worth of American exports in June. Those levies hit products such as motorcycles, orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, cigarettes and denim.\n\nEU economies are already under pressure , and new tariffs could further dent growth.\n\nThe trading relationship is worth more than $1 trillion annually, but Europe exports significantly more goods to the United States than the other way around.\n\nIn 2018, the European Union exported \u20ac407 billion ($445 billion) worth of goods to the United States. US exports to the European Union totaled $318 billion. And the July goods deficit with the European Union \u2014 at $20.1 billion \u2014 was the highest on record, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nThe WTO on Tuesday slashed its forecast for world trade growth in 2019 to 1.2% from 2.6%.", "description": "The United States plans to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European exports as soon as October 18, a senior US Trade Representative official said on a call with reporters Wednesday.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady", "Charles Riley", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190927143241-airbus-plane-production-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg"}
