Likewise, the steel tariffs will be increased back up to 50 percent, the level prior to reduction in May,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThe United States will also immediately stop negotiations, being led by the Department of Commerce, with respect to a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe announcement follows a high-level White House national security meeting to develop a strategy to contain the chaos unleashed by Trump\u2019s impromptu decision last week to withdraw American troops from northern Syria ahead of Turkey\u2019s military offensive. The resulting violence has set off a cascade of developments on the ground in Syria that risks upending five years of progress in the war against ISIS, and now pits the U.S. against a fellow NATO alliance member.\n\nA man walks on a street in the Turkish city of Ceylanp\u0131nar while smoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn, during bombardment by Turkish forces, on Oct. 10, 2019. | Emanuele Satolli More\n\nIn recent days, the Turks fired artillery shells that landed within several hundred yards within U.S. forces still in the war-torn country; hundreds of ISIS family members and sympathizers escaped a camp guarded by Kurdish forces; and the Kurds switched military allegiances out of necessity, opting to work with Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad and Russia instead of the United States. The U.S. military has already begun withdrawing nearly all of its 1,000 troops from Syria, which means it will be unable to transfer the highest value ISIS prisoners out of Syria.\n\nBeyond the battlefield, the fallout is likely to have long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy alliances and credibility on the world stage, seven Administration officials tell TIME. Each of the officials who spoke to TIME on the devolving situation in Syria did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. \u201cThis will almost certainly go down as one of the biggest foreign and security policy decisions made in our lifetime,\u201d an Administration official says. \u201cWe are about to undo five years worth of progress, made an unstable region even worse, betrayed our partners, and shaken the faith of our allies. I am unaware of anyone in government service that was consulted before this decision, and unaware of anyone in that same group that thinks this is a good idea.\u201d\n\nRyan Crocker, who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Kuwait and Lebanon over his four decade-long career with the State Department, says Trump handled the situation with Turkey in the worst way possible. With little warning, he removed U.S. troops from northern Syria, effectively green-lighting a Turkish invasion. \u201cWe could have avoided this with a quiet, consistent policy based on the above, which might also have given us a channel to Damascus,\u201d he says. \u201cThey and their allies are winning; we need channels to them. Another avoidable disaster.\u201d\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels shout on the back of a pickup truck on a street in the Turkish border town of Ak\u00e7akale on Oct. 14, 2019. | Emanuele Satolli More", "description": "President Trump announced he leveled economic sanctions, hiked tariffs and halted trade negotiations as a result of Turkey's military incursion in Syria against the Syrian Kurds.", "authors": ["W.J.
