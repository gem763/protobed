An increase in average sales volume more than offset higher exploration expenses, income taxes and administrative expenses, the company said Wednesday.\n\nSales revenue in the period rose 12% to $1.49 billion, it said.\n\nPTTEP raised its sales estimates for 2019 to about 345,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, primarily on the acquisition of Malaysian assets. It expects Dubai crude-oil prices to average $60-$65 a barrel in 2019, with likely higher U.S. crude supply offsetting lower production in OPEC countries.\n\nPTTEP has more than 40 projects in a dozen countries, with the bulk of its profits coming from operations in Thailand.\n\nWrite to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 30, 2019 05:29 ET (09:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
