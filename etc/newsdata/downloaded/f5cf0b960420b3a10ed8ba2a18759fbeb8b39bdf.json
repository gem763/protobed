He used lace overlays, obi sashes, intricate swirl prints, romantic flowers, capes, one shoulder gowns, brocade fabrics and kimono-style dresses for spring-summer 2020.\n\n\u201cI was raised there. It\u2019s where I was born. All the memories are there. Before, maybe I didn\u2019t have confidence to use (the) Japanese element. So always journalists are asking me, \u2018What is the Japanese influence in fashion,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t answer that,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBut now \u2026 I have the confidence so I can use those kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nThe 71-year-old Shoji is from Sendai but is based in America. He rolled out sleeveless dresses with embroidered tulle and colors that included periwinkle, coral, deep violet and also black and white. He also showcased body diversity with some curvier models on the runway.\n\nHe put a tie bow in front of a high-slit black gown trimmed in red with side cutouts. A cocktail dress in delicate pink had a wide black belt with a large bow to one side. A bright white gown had sleeves with a drape effect at the shoulders a low back.\n\nShoji kept a black high-waisted trouser look sleek with a patterned floral blouse that had asymmetrical short sleeves.\n\nThere was plenty of sparkle and drama in full tulle skirts on statement gowns, sometimes mixed with his lace overlay. Shoji stuck to florals in patterns and embellishment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tadashi Shoji said returning to his Japanese roots on the runway took years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Alicia Rancilio"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/fashion_-_tadashi_shoji_spring_summer_2020_84997_c88-0-1340-730_s1770x1032.jpg?e8594dd231ef85bac1bdf599ad616edf9eebed6d", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
