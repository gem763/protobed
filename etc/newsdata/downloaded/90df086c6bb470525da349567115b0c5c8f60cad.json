Civility \u2014 making your point respectfully \u2014 is also fundamental.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision, Judy and Dennis Shepard told me, but they went ahead and did it anyway. They delivered a message of truth to power \u2014 in this case to the Trump administration at the Department of Justice.\n\nThe Shepards, whose gay son Matthew was brutally murdered in 1998 because of his sexual orientation, were invited by Attorney General William Barr to give remarks at the department\u2019s ceremony last week marking the 10th anniversary of the federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Named in memory of their son and James Byrd Jr., a black man murdered by white supremacists in 1998, it expanded the definition of a hate crime to include acts motivated by a victim\u2019s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.\n\nUnable to attend because of a travel conflict, the Shepards sent a powerful speech to be read on their behalf. \u201cWe find it interesting and hypocritical that (Barr) would invite us to this event commemorating a hate crime law named after our son and Mr. Byrd, while at the same time asking the Supreme Court to allow the legalized firing of transgender employees,\u201d they said in their prepared remarks.\n\n'Personally challenging' to speak out\n\nMatthew Shepard\u2019s parents, exhibiting what President John F. Kennedy once described as \"that most admirable of human virtues \u2014 courage,\u201d forcefully noted the Trump administration\u2019s abject failure to protect the rights and lives of transgender people. Only recently, Barr\u2019s department had argued before the Supreme Court in favor of allowing gay and transgender individuals to be fired from their jobs because of who they are. Currently, LGBT people can be fired in 17 states simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nDennis Shepard, in an exclusive interview, told me why their decision to speak out was \u201cpersonally challenging.\u201d He understood that \u201cit would be nothing more than a photo op for Barr \u2026 and, ultimately, the administration\u201d to falsely claim their support of the LGBTQ community and other marginalized communities covered by the hate crimes law, even as they do all they can to take away their equal rights.\n\nDennis and Judy Shepard arriving at the county courthouse in Laramie, Wyoming, on Nov. 2, 1999.

If American citizens do not speak out loud and clear, and object about the obliteration of their civil rights and equal rights, those rights will disappear quickly.\u201d\n\nAnd that is the challenge today as the Trump administration hammers away at the rights and protections of the marginalized and disenfranchised in this country. When do we speak out? How do we speak out?\n\nTruth to power in 1950\n\nBoth questions are embedded in the 1946 prose poem (now a popular meme), \u201cFirst they came \u2026\u201d by Martin Niemoller, a German Lutheran pastor, who wrote about the cowardice of German intellectuals and clergy to speak against the Nazis' rise to power and their incremental targeting of different groups:\n\n\"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out \u2014 because I was not a socialist.\n\n\"Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out \u2014 because I was not a trade unionist.\n\n\"Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out \u2014 because I was not a Jew.\n\n\"Then they came for me \u2014 and there was no one left to speak for me.\"\n\nThe Shepards\u2019 story recalls another courageous American, Margaret Chase Smith, who also spoke truth to power. In 1950, the first-term senator from Maine challenged her fellow Republican senator, Joseph McCarthy, who had falsely claimed to possess the names of 205 card-carrying communists in the State Department.\n\nSmith initially hesitated to take on McCarthy. \u201cIn those days,\u201d she later explained, \u201cfreshman senators were to be seen and not heard.\u201d She hoped a senior member would take the lead. But no one stepped up and after much consideration, Smith delivered the speech, \u201cA Declaration of Conscience,\u201d for which she\u2019s now celebrated.\n\nCivil dissent is crucial to democracy\n\n\u201cFreedom of speech is not what it used to be in America,\u201d Smith stated. \u201cIt has been so abused by some that it is not exercised by others.\u201d Finally in 1954, the full Senate concurred with the \u201clady from Maine\u201d and censured McCarthy for conduct \u201ccontrary to senatorial traditions.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s career lay in ruins. Smith is lionized for her courage.\n\nIn a nation that exalts freedom of speech and dissent, the type of courage displayed by the Shepards remains rare and yet crucial to democracy. In Kennedy\u2019s Pulitzer-prize winning book, \u201cProfiles in Courage,\u201d he reminded us: \u201cA man does what he must \u2014 in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures \u2014 and that is the basis of all human morality.\u201d\n\nThe Shepards and Smith shared one other fundamental value, civility.\n\n\u201cIt was important that we project calmness and indignation in a civilized and respectful manner, unlike that projected by members of the current administration,\u201d Dennis Shepard told me.\n\nSmith, meanwhile, never personally attacked McCarthy. She denounced his policies and tactics, which became known as \u201cMcCarthyism.\u201d\n\nTo paraphrase former first lady Michelle Obama, they went high when others went low.\n\nSteven Petrow, a writer on civility and manners and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is the author of five etiquette books.
