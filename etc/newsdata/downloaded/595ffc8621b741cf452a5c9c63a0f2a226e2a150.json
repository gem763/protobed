The venerable audio company doesn\u2019t usually do much in the way of commercials, but this one highlighted a particular pet peeve of mine in mainstream headphone commercials: the celebrities peddling them don\u2019t know jack about audio (probably).\n\nSennheiser has three such ads, at least so far. I was watching 30 Rock on Hulu when I saw this:\n\nI first assumed it to be the latest Beats commercial, before noticing those cans weren\u2019t Beats at all. It got a solid chuckle out of me.\n\nThe company has a couple of others along the same lines. Here\u2019s one taking the fashion:\n\nAnd another one playing on the athlete trope:\n\nMind you, I don\u2019t mean to complain about Beat\u2019s sound quality. While early generations were ridiculed by audiophiles for their inordinate amount of bass and exorbitant pricing, some newer Beats are legitimately decent headphones. Their price-to-performance ratio may still be questionable, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with also wanting a pair of headphones that looks and feels nice. And I mean, Sennheiser sells a $50,000 pair of headphones, which isn\u2019t exactly a great value proposition either.\n\nIt\u2019s just when you\u2019re priority is sound quality, you probably shouldn\u2019t trust the advice of a celebrity with no audio credentials.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_7558b94b.png&signature=f4ae8c1fd33e7ed8e6b2f532b03b13aa", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
