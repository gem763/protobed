She told him to heat the essay before he tried to read it.\n\nYuji Yamada, who teaches Japanese history and ninja culture, took her essay home where he carefully heated it using a stove. When Haga\u2019s essay revealed itself in the heat, Yamada, who promised his students extra marks for creativity, awarded her an A.\n\n\u201cShe replicated what is written in records about ninja writing. She proved it actually works and she went through a trial-and-error process,\u201d Yamada said.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s dying trades: a tour of pawnshops, coppersmiths and more with \u2018Sunset Survivor\u2019 author Lindsay Varty\n\nHaga made the ink by soaking soybeans overnight and then squeezing them into a paste. She tested three different kinds of paper to find the best one.\n\n\u201cIf the paper is too thin, it burns when heated. If it\u2019s too thick, it doesn\u2019t absorb the ink very well,\u201d she said.\n\nYamada said when asked to be creative, his students usually presented their reports shaped as scrolls, or folded into throwing stars.\n\nEimi made her invisible ink with soybeans.
