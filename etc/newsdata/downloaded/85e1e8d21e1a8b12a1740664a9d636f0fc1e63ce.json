REUTERS/Stringer\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is prepared to tap U.S. emergency oil reserves if necessary after drone attacks shut oil output in Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest crude exporter, a Department of Energy spokeswoman said.\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry \u201cstands ready to deploy resources from the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserves if necessary to offset any disruptions to oil markets as a result of this act of aggression,\u201d spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed credit for Saturday\u2019s attacks on two plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum processing facility Abqaiq.\n\nPerry directed department leaders to work with the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) \u201con potential available options for collective global action if needed,\u201d Hynes said.\n\nThe IEA said on Twitter earlier in the day that it was in contact with Saudi authorities and other major oil-producing nations, and that markets for now are well-supplied.\n\nThe United States has occasionally coordinated with the IEA on collective draw downs of oil from international reserves.\n\nThe SPR, held in heavily-guarded underground storage caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts, currently holds nearly 645 million barrels, or about the amount the United States consumes in a month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has often urged countries in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is a member, to produce more oil to moderate crude prices. U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela have removed millions of barrels of oil from global markets.", "description": "The Trump administration is prepared to tap U.S. emergency oil reserves if necessary after drone attacks shut oil output in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, a Department of Energy spokeswoman said.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429914188&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0SL", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
