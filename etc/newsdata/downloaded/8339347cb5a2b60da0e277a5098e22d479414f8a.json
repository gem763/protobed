The speed and pace they play the game is phenomenal, it was great to witness.'\n\nBillings, Kent Cricket captain, said: 'I enjoyed the session far more than cricket training! It's great always to see other sports teams train at the top level, there's always things you can learn from yourself.'", "description": "England cricketers Joe Denly and Sam Billings took part in a full Crystal Palace training session last week.
