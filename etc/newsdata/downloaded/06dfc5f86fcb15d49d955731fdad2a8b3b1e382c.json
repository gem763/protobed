He along with other candidates pledged not to take any money from the industry.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential candidate discussed climate change policy, as part of a seven-hour marathon Q&A session that included individual sessions with 10 of the Democratic candidates.\n\nThe 76-year-old has already released a $1.7 trillion plan to fight climate change and signed a pledge to reject funding from the industry in June.\n\n\"How can we trust you to hold these corporations and executives accountable for their crimes against humanity when we know tomorrow you are holding a high-dollar fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, a fossil fuel executive?\" asked audience member Isaac Larkin.\n\n\"He's not a fossil fuel executive,\" Biden quickly responded, before pivoting to his plan to hold fossil fuel executives and corporations responsible.\n\nThe Intercept reported on Wednesday that Biden was scheduled to attend a fundraiser in New York on Thursday by Andrew Goldman, co-founder of Houston-based natural gas production company Western LNG. The company's leading project is an offshore floating gas production facility designed to provide Canadian gas to the growing market in Asia.\n\n\"I was told by my staff he doesn't have any responsibility related to the company,\" Biden added later after moderator Anderson Cooper followed up. \"If that turns out not to be true, then I will not, in any way, accept his help.\" Biden's campaign stressed that Goldman has no present responsibilities with Western LNG or its board, according to the New York Times.\n\nGoldman is \"not involved in the day to day operation\" of the company, according to a tweet from Biden spokeswoman Symone D. Sanders. \"He's not on the board of the company, nor the board of the portfolio company.\"\n\n\"VP Biden signed a pledge not to take money from fossil fuel executives,\" she continued. \"He stands by it, and he has not violated it.\"\n\nBefore co-founding Western LNG, Goldman served as an adviser to Biden until he entered the White House in 2009, CNBC reported.\n\nRead more: Joe Biden will solicit big money from Wall Street donors right after participating in CNN's climate town hall\n\nAccording to CNBC, Biden was slated to attend two fundraisers on Thursday hosted by Wall Street executives \u2014 the first hosted by Jack Rosen, the CEO of real estate firm Rosen Partners and president of the American Jewish Congress, and the second held by David Solomon and Goldman, partners at investment firm Hildred Capital Partners.\n\nBiden has refused to take money from corporate lobbyists in this election cycle, though a major fundraiser was held at the beginning of his campaign and was hosted by David L. Cohen, a top Comcast executive who supervises the telecommunications company's Washington lobbying efforts. Cohen is legally not required to register as a lobbyist.", "description": "The former vice president was confronted at CNN's climate change town hall on Wednesday night over his ties to a former fossil fuel executive.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7067472e22af47a81a0816-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
