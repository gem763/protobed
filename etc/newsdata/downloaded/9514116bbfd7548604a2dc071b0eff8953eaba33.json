He was the sparring partner Jose Aldo drafted in to mimic Conor McGregor\u2019s fighting style ahead of their scheduled fight at UFC 189.\n\nUnfortunately, things didn\u2019t exactly go to plan, as Bilharinho went on to damage Aldo\u2019s ribs with a spinning back-kick during sparring, forcing the then-champion out of the fight and setting off a chain of events that eventually resulted in McGregor sitting on top of the MMA world after making Aldo the victim of a 13-second knockout at UFC 194 in December 2015.\n\nThe Brazilian, known as \u201cSpeed,\u201d has been away from the cage since an April 2016 loss (the only defeat of his career) in the Jungle Fight promotion in his homeland. But now he\u2019s back, and the featherweight marked his return with a stunning flying-knee finish at Future FC 9 this weekend.\n\nBilharinho faced off against his countryman Junior Duarte, who was actually on a decent run of form heading into the contest, but Bilharinho shook off the rust of more than three years away from the cage to deliver a spectacular finish.\n\nHe dropped his opponent with a perfectly-timed counter right hook, then unloaded a series of ground strikes on Duarte, who looked all but done at that point. However, the referee allowed the action to continue and Duarte somehow found his way back to his feet, where it all got much, much worse for him.\n\nBarely able to keep himself upright, Duarte staggered back towards the fence and, as he looked to use the cage to balance himself, he was met by a spectacular flying knee from Bilharinho, which knocked him out cold. Watch it here (via Twitter):\n\nAfter 3 years away, Jonas \"Speed\" Bilharinho returns to the cage landing one of the craziest flying knees of the year. Wait for it. #FutureMMA9 pic.twitter.com/s0RLS62t9A \u2014 caposa (@Grabaka_Hitman) October 20, 2019\n\nThe stunning finish takes Bilharinho\u2019s career record to 7-1-1 and, if he stays active and puts on another performance or two like that one, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see the UFC or Bellator come calling for the flashy Brazilian\u2019s services in 2020.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
