Should this close above resistance within next hour 30, then the target is $203. Expect alts to rise as ETH does,\u201d she noted.\n\n$Eth We are currently breaking out the ascending triangle here on @PrimeXbt Should this close above resistance within next hour 30, then the target is $203 Expect alts to rise as Eth does\ud83d\ude0a pic.twitter.com/5g0m8vu3KV \u2014 The Cryptomist (@TheCryptomist) October 9, 2019\n\nETH May Revisit $183 Before Uptrend Extends\n\nAlthough ETH failed to close above the upper boundary referenced in The Cryptomist\u2019s tweet, its recent dip to the $180 region and subsequent bounce may help bolster its near-term price action.\n\nHornHairs, another popular crypto analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that $183 is a critical support level for Ethereum in the near-term, and further added that a hold above this level could spark the next notable uptrend.\n\n\u201c$ETH #Ethereum update: $160-170 bids in profit. $200 is the next bullish objective. Want to see $183 hold from here on,\u201d he said.\n\n$ETH #Ethereum update: $160-170 bids in profit. $200 is the next bullish objective.
