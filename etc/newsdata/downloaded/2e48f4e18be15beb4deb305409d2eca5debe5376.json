One of them publicly disavowed the blockchain earlier this month, citing the excessive power of the largest EOS token holders.\n\nBlock.One, the company that launched the code behind EOS following a $4.1 billion ICO, is the largest token holder. Critics say it could easily redefine governance on the chain but has yet to take action.\n\nIn early September, one of the small companies that helped to get the EOS blockchain off the ground called it quits.\n\nEOS Tribe, which participated in the launch of the first EOS chain, announced on Steemit that it was stepping away from EOS as a block producer (BP) candidate, focusing on other blockchains and other implementations of the EOSIO software.\n\nEOS Tribe\u2019s Eugene Luzgin wrote in the post:\n\n\u201cWe at EOS Tribe have never participated in the game of vote trading and stayed true to our principles, and hence while we leave EOS as Block Producer, we are also free to speak truth and give warnings to the rest.\u201d\n\nWhich, as they say, is a lot to unpack.\n\nLuzgin left, in short, because he said it is no longer possible to earn funds for maintaining the blockchain without support from major EOS whales, the colloquial term for those with very large token holdings. Those whales are overwhelmingly supporting BPs located in China. There are 21 BPs at any time who establish consensus on the chain, make governance decisions and earn substantial rewards.\n\nThis has become a widespread point of concern among longtime participants in the EOS community, for reasons that include centralization and threatened censorship-resistance, according to an investigation by CoinDesk.\n\nThe BPs that Luzgin believes have the strongest technical proficiency have overwhelmingly been relegated to lower-tier rewards or no rewards at all.\n\n\u201cThey effectively have a brain-drain now,\u201d Luzgin told CoinDesk in an interview.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in his concerns, though it might be easy to dismiss doubters\u2019 complaints as a simple East-West divide \u2013 two EOS constituencies that literally speak different languages failing to build a consensus about the protocol.\n\nThere is no proverbial smoking gun showing that the present configuration of BPs is bad for the $3.8 billion blockchain, but there is a mountain of evidence bolstering the case for concern.\n\nDPoS in action\n\nEOS is the world\u2019s seventh-largest blockchain by market cap as of this writing. It went live in June 2018, after a yearlong initial coin offering (ICO) that raised $4.1 billion in crypto for Block.One and a tumultuous process following the release of EOSIO software, the code that powers EOS and its forks.\n\nThe chief feature of EOS was always its most controversial: EOS uses a consensus model called delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), where higher throughput is achieved by decreasing the number of nodes that participate in consensus.\n\nBefore EOS launched, the configuration was widely panned by crypto investors as too centralized. Blockchain Capital\u2019s Spencer Bogart shared an opinion held by many in April 2018 when he wrote that blockchains that compromise on permissionless-ness \u201cwill end up as less efficient varieties of today\u2019s centralized platforms.\u201d\n\nDPoS can take many forms, but on EOS, 21 nodes have all the power over the chain. These 21 nodes are chosen by token holders, who stake EOS coins in a vote for up to 30 BPs. The ones with the most votes serve in the top 21, and the vote is effectively continuous. That means BPs can move in and out of the top 21 at almost any time.\n\nAs of this writing, a majority of the BPs indicate their locations as within China. Sources tell CoinDesk that multiple others are also located in China despite outward appearances.\n\nCoinDesk surveyed all the top BPs as of Sept. 6, with questions about what they viewed their role on the blockchain to be and how they were supporting its users. Six sent back detailed answers. CoinDesk found no way to contact three others.\n\nTo produce blocks\n\nThe top 21 earn significant revenue, and another roughly 50 (this number is not fixed) earn meaningful revenue as standby BPs, both sharing a portion of the 1 percent annual inflation of EOS tokens.\n\nWith EOS Tribe\u2019s departure, Aaron Cox of Greymass, a BP candidate, told CoinDesk:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think that\u2019s the new trend. This downward spiral (which ultimately is just a race to the bottom) isn\u2019t a good situation to be in, as rent seekers continue to take over. And if it continues will probably become more dire as more of us are cut off.\u201d\n\nMany BPs that were once often seen in the top 21 now no longer even qualify for rewards as standby BPs, including BP candidates such as EOSSphere, ShEOS, EOSAmsterdam, EOS Detroit, EOS Dublin and EOS Venezuela.\n\nGreg Simpson built EDNA, which is designed to enable users to monetize their genetic information, with the original EOS in mind. EDNA is a decentralized application (or dapp) running on the software Block.One created.\n\nBut these days he\u2019s hedging by using EOS and its two main forks, Telos and Worbli, because of uncertainty about EOS due to what he perceives as inadequate governance.\n\nStill, he\u2019s not ready to give up yet. This has been a rapidly changing space.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t this space three months ago. And it won\u2019t be the same space three months from now,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cReally no one can project out what it\u2019s gonna look like in a year.\u201d\n\nEither way, EOS has not proved to be the high throughput chain beloved by enterprise clients that its progenitors touted it to be. Mainly, it has become a chain for running gambling dapps.\n\nLuzgin lamented developers who have put all their creativity into EOS moving down into standby BP or even unpaid status. He pointed to companies like Bitfinex and Huobi who are participating in its consensus.\n\n\u201cEOS is a just a side gig for them. It\u2019s just extra revenue,\u201d Luzgin said, comparing the exchanges to companies that are all-in on the blockchain\u2019s potential. \u201cThat view is very different. They aren\u2019t really participating in the community.\u201d\n\nHuobi and Bitfinex were among a handful of BPs that never replied to CoinDesk\u2019s inquiries.\n\nOutsider history\n\nEOS has faced skepticism from the broader crypto world from the start. Shortly after EOS launched, crypto scions looked askance again when the leading BPs moved to right a wrong.\n\nAmong their first collective acts, BPs froze seven accounts that had been shown to hold stolen tokens (tokens attained by tricking users during the migration of assets from ethereum \u2013 upon which Block.One ran the token sale \u2013 to the actual EOS blockchain).\n\nThe decision to freeze those accounts presaged the controversy the blockchain is facing now, because the top BPs did so without any kind of agreed-upon governance process. A \u201cconstitution\u201d had been drafted, but it had not passed a referendum of EOS users.\n\nIt was never entirely clear where legitimacy originated from on EOS, but when the chain started, 15 percent of the tokens needed to be staked for a vote in order for it to launch. So that 15 percent figure became the consensus figure for giving a governance document legitimacy, but it never happened.\n\nThat consensus was documented as a rule in a draft constitution that never got ratified.\n\nOne of the BPs at the time, EOS New York, wrote after the vote to freeze the seven accounts about its ambivalence in freezing funds without any legitimized authority to do so.\n\nThe organization\u2019s statement read:\n\n\u201cAs a community, it should be our top priority to develop the mechanisms that are capable of polling the token-holder community and obtaining the on-chain consensus required to move issues, like the Constitution, forward.\u201d\n\nEOS New York was one of the original 21 BPs at the chain\u2019s launch.\n\nEventually, EOS would jettison the whole idea of a constitution for governing the chain. Dissatisfaction in the community around governance would grow, which brings us to today.\n\nBrock Pierce, an early member of the Block.One team and still an active member of the EOS community, would make waves in June 2019 with a speech at the Tulip Conference when he suggested that EOS is now governed by a \u201cChinese oligarchy.\u201d\n\nAnd while it\u2019s true that a majority, if not a supermajority, of BPs right now are based in China, Cox of Greymass insists that the concern is not specifically about China itself. He told CoinDesk:\n\n\u201cThe threat itself in this centralization is due to shifting regulations and potential risks they may pose. If the BPs for EOS were 90 percent in India, Brazil, or any other country \u2013 the same concerns would still be valid in regards to centralization.\u201d\n\nIn his post, EOS Tribe\u2019s Luzgin noted that shortly after EOS launched it started to see BP candidates joining the top 21 who hadn\u2019t participated in the launching of the chain at all, propelled there by supportive votes from whales. By the summer\u2019s end, Block.One, still the largest holder of EOS, started to make noise about voting its stake in favor of the teams it deemed the most technically proficient.\n\nBlock.One holds so many tokens that it could all but handpick the top 21 BPs (or at least exclude any BP that did not get its nod). Yet more than a year later, it still has not cast its first vote.\n\nShortly after the Tulip Conference, Block.One CEO Brendan Blumer wrote a post on the main EOS Telegram channel, where he addressed a number of issues without getting very specific. On voting, he wrote:\n\n\u201cEOS governance is tricky and is not something we\u2019ve chosen to ignore, but have been waiting for the right time to get involved, and in a way that upholds and furthers aligns and decentralizes the community.\u201d\n\nToday, here\u2019s what EOS governance has settled on: At any time, any decision can be made if 15 of the 21 BPs move to support it. It doesn\u2019t matter if in the next set of blocks those BPs change dramatically. To reduce the prior decision, that new set of BPs would need to establish a new supermajority of BPs.\n\nThere is a system in place to run a vote across all EOS holders, but now, according to EOS New York, referenda are simply a way of gauging the interest of holders.\n\nDapp disappointment\n\nOne of the complaints that members of the community often make about the current crop of BPs is that they don\u2019t prioritize building new dapps that will attract other users to the blockchain.\n\nThe theory had been that BPs would use inflation rewards to fund new tools, code improvements and dapps to improve the ecosystem. One of the first consequences of EOS\u2019s failure to agree upon a shared decision-making process was the burning of approximately $167 million in the EOS savings account that had been designated for the worker proposal system.\n\nAs previously reported, the proposal system had been a way to fund dapp development on EOS (as well as community functions, lobbying costs and security audits), but without a way to agree on how to distribute the funds, they just accumulated, diluting the market cap to no purpose.\n\nSo, all 34 million EOS got burnt on May 8, 2019 \u2013 with potential funding for thousands of new applications going with it.\n\nBroader changes were already underway as that decision was finalized, though. In February, EOS New York proposed an EOS User Agreement (EUA). In April, the EUA was ratified by 15 of the 21 BPs at the time, according to a spokesperson for EOS New York, who took a role shepherding it through.\n\nWhat\u2019s notable about the EUA is what it doesn\u2019t address: in particular, vote-buying. The interim constitution explicitly forbids vote-buying but the EUA is silent on the topic.\n\nThere had always been a concern that EOS BPs could protect their lucrative position on the network by sharing block rewards. A top BP can earn about 900 EOS a day, which works out to over $1 million per year at current prices.\n\nSaid Greymass\u2019s Cox:\n\n\u201cEOS was one of the few DPoS blockchains where [vote-buying] wasn\u2019t happening until earlier this year with the introduction of the EUA. Many (maybe the majority?) other DPoS blockchain operate under this model, some even with it baked right into their protocols.\u201d\n\nIn an email to CoinDesk, Newdex, a decentralized exchange on EOS, explained how its affiliated company, Newpool, spends its block rewards.\n\n\u201cMore than 90 percent of the pool rewards will be given to token holders, that incentivizes token holders to hold EOS tokens for long and also increase their participation in the community,\u201d a spokesperson for the company told CoinDesk.\n\nAnother highly rated BP, Big One, also welcomes participants to stake votes for the blockchain and profit for doing so. Infinity Stones invites staking on any number of protocols, including EOS.\n\n\u201cThe thing about vote-buying is that at this point there\u2019s technically nothing against the \u2018rules\u2019 about it,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThere\u2019s not much value-add happening in this new market dynamic, just the shuffling of meaningless inflation.\u201d\n\nWhatever anyone thinks morally about the optics of vote-buying, the consequence is this: BPs engaging in vote-buying invest in ensuring their leadership positions and not in the actual ecosystem. That\u2019s what frustrates those who want to see EOS grow.\n\nEOS Tribe\u2019s Luzgin calls it the difference between \u201cbuilders\u201d and \u201cminers.\u201d Builders, he argues, want block rewards to fund larger contributions. Miners want the block rewards. The latter strategy has been rapidly gaining ground.\n\nVote-buying to guarantee block rewards raises a philosophical question: Is it appropriate to expect BPs to spend part of their resources on new tools and dapps?\n\nWhere is it written that that\u2019s an obligation of BPs? The answer: It\u2019s not.\n\nThere was a consensus among those who participated in the launch of the blockchain that a BP should be reinvesting in EOS. In fact, the thinking then was that a company could earn votes from community members for their BP candidacy by building good, widely used tools. That strategy hasn\u2019t held up.\n\nAnd not everyone agrees that it should even be an expectation. One BP, EOS Wiki, responded to a question about what the company had done to help create new dapps in a statement delivered via Telegram:\n\n\u201cWe would not answer this question although we are incubating dapp/app. All is because this is not a \u2018legal duty\u2019 of being a block producer, please read the EUA.\u201d\n\nPerformance consequences\n\nSome sources hint that there have been bad signs for the fundamental performance of the blockchain. Others say everything is mostly fine.\n\n\u201cWe see top BPs missing not just blocks but whole rounds,\u201d Luzgin told us. \u201cThey are supposed to produce 12 blocks. They miss all 12.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what CoinDesk has been able to discern: One of the BPs that Greymass and EOS Tribe still pointed to as a builder of useful things on the network and one that still mostly manages to stay in the top 21, Attic Lab, out of Ukraine, was able to point to one particular metric where it stands out.\n\nAloha EOS has tracked a benchmark test for BPs since the very early days, and Attic Lab has consistently scored the highest on those measurements. Aloha EOS scores the benchmark by asking each BP to run a calculation and timing it. Recently, Big.One, the second-most-backed BP, and the BPs run by two exchanges (Bitfinex and Huobi) have scored the lowest.\n\nAnother way that dapp developers see EOS as losing ground is in the area of application program interfaces (APIs). APIs make it easier for apps to query the state of the chain and push transactions. The most robust APIs allow a dapp to query the full history of EOS. Since the blockchain is generating thousands of transactions, this is an expensive service to offer.\n\nCox argued:\n\n\u201cBPs should be providing API access since they are the ones building the actual blocks, and providing direct access to their internal networks (through APIs) gives users a direct path to submit transactions.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 6, 11 BPs were currently providing some kind of API at that time, according to Cox. There are different APIs and different levels of quality of APIs, too. Cox said that many dapps have told his company that its is the fastest, this despite the fact that Greymass is, lately, a standby and not a full BP.\n\n\u201cSubjectively, it feels wrong that the lower-ranked BPs are the one shouldering this cost,\u201d he wrote, while also noting that a good API requires hardware and skill to run, such that even well-funded BPs may not be equipped to run one.\n\n\u201cAs the blockchain grows, it will be harder to catch up,\u201d EOS Tribe\u2019s Luzgin said, because it\u2019s such a gigantic amount of data.\n\nOn Sept. 13, EOS Nation\u2019s BP scanner only showed two entities providing full-history APIs.\n\nEDNA\u2019s Simpson told CoinDesk that the unreliability of some BPs required EDNA to revise its code so it checked more than one API, for when some weren\u2019t operational or when blocks were dropped.\n\nAnd it is worth noting that there are other services a BP can provide that can also benefit the community that don\u2019t fit neatly into these buckets.\n\nFor example, CertiK, a security company, noted that it provides security services to the network rather than APIs. Newdex said it directed votes to BPs providing useful services in order to help them earn funds.\n\nMeet.One has been providing news about EOS in Chinese languages for that audience, contributing code updates, new developer tools and funding meetups in China.\n\nStill, most of the leading BPs simply didn\u2019t reply to CoinDesk\u2019s questions about the current controversy around the blockchain\u2019s leadership. This controversy is well-trod ground within EOS and its many, many Telegram channels.\n\nThose who believe the blockchain needs to advance await some kind of resolution. EDNA\u2019s Simpson assessed the current crop of BPs, held in place by large positions taken by a relatively small number of users, and asked:\n\n\u201cWhat is it that\u2019s driving the vote? It\u2019s certainly not innovation. It\u2019s not production. It\u2019s not making the blockchain more useable.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s being done\n\nMaybe EOS is fine. Maybe it\u2019s in trouble. Either way, it\u2019s worth casual investors knowing that a cadre of adherents to the protocol since the early days are growing concerned.\n\nAt this stage, there is no one prevailing cause for concern about EOS. It is a blockchain seeing a large amount of use, but it also has not yet attained the status of a blockchain that attracts major companies looking for a highly secure database with high throughput. That\u2019s what its strongest adherents had hoped it would become.\n\n\u201cBlock.One kind of screwed up royally because they could have used their leverage to steer in the right direction, but they chose not to do it,\u201d Luzgin said.\n\nPerhaps most tellingly, Block.One itself has yet to launch (or really say anything more about) the service it announced in June with a glitzy and expensive rollout, Voice, its completely de-anonymized Facebook competitor. Block.One said the service would be built on the public EOS blockchain.\n\nLumi Wallet recently compiled a comprehensive list of reform proposals floated by different parts of the community, assessing the pros and cons of each approach.\n\nLumi CEO Diana Furman told CoinDesk:\n\n\u201cI was convinced that change is needed by the very fact of the discussion \u2013 we have been following the EOS community for long, and everyone, from ordinary users to the main figures of Block.One, has been discussing this topic. If there is a discussion, it means something needs to be done.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, whole other chains have expressed their preferences for change by forking the blockchain and opening new instances of the EOSIO software. The two most notable implementations are Telos and Worbli.\n\nTelos has added a number of innovations that ensure potential BPs are actually ready to serve, but its most notable reform was made in its genesis block, where Telos capped every account\u2019s token holdings at 40,000, thereby curtailing the power of whales on the network.\n\nWorbli was created with financial regulation and certain consumer protections (such as account recovery) built in, with a focus on the financial industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the broader community is waiting on Block.One to make any kind of move at all. Some have pushed it to turn a portion of its tokens over to a proxy, permitting users to deploy them as they saw fit, even to just enforce a rotation of BPs.\n\n\u201cAny centralized blockchain will be looked down on,\u201d Luzgin said. \u201cI really like the technology behind it. \u2026 [It\u2019s the] governance that\u2019s screwing it now.\u201d\n\nBlock.One did not comment to CoinDesk as of press time.\n\nCox summed up the situation this way, expressing a wary sentiment shared by many who have remained involved with the EOS blockchain:\n\n\u201cEvidence is hard to come by in concrete examples of damage, and even as to why any of this is a bad thing. I do at this point think we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg though.\u201d\n\nImage: Block.One CEO Brendan Blumer at the launch event for Voice, June 2019, via Block.One", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Brendan-Blumer-Option-3.jpg"}
