I would love for that to be a birthday present,\u201d Mark Lerner told The Washington Times.\n\nHeading into Tuesday night\u2019s Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, the Nationals are one win away from eliminating the St. Louis Cardinals and advancing to the Fall Classic.\n\nMark Lerner isn\u2019t the only son looking to put a smile on his father\u2019s face Tuesday.\n\nMike Rizzo, the Nationals president of baseball operations and general manager, also shares the baseball bond with his dad, Phil Rizzo.\n\nThe elder Rizzo, a long-time baseball scout, was born in Chicago in 1929 and was inducted into the inaugural class of the Professional Baseball Scouts Hall of Fame in 2008. He was named senior advisor to the Nationals general manager the following year.\n\n\u201cMike and I, we want to win this for our fathers,\u201d Mark Lerner said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
