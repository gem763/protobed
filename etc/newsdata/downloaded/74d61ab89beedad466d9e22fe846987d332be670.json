Talk to your children and take their lead\n\n\u201cStart to have a conversation from an early age to find out how they feel about their information being shared online. Explain why you\u2019d like to share and who will see the information,\u201d says Claire.\n\nRemember that once information is out there, and particularly if it has been tagged or reposted, it is very hard to take down.\n\n\u201cIf they say they don\u2019t want their information shared ask them why. Explore whether information could be shared in a way that both of you are happy with. Consider using the NSPCC\u2019s family online agreement to help with your discussions, to build a relationship of trust, and mutual respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can learn digital citizenship habits from your children,\u201d adds Leah. \u201cKids and teens are often more thoughtful and sophisticated digital citizens than we, their parents, are. Not only have they been growing up in a digital world, but they may be studying digital citizenship in school.\u201d\n\n4. Remember sharing on social media is forever\n\n\u201cParents have always shared stories and photos with friends and family. \u2018Sharenting\u2019, however, takes sharing to a different level,\u201d says Claire.\n\n\u201cSharented information has a reach and longevity unimagined 20 years ago. Remember that once information is out there, and particularly if it has been tagged or reposted, it is very hard to take down. Would your child \u2013 indeed would you \u2013 want the posts you made when they were seven to be viewed by their university friends, work colleagues or future employers?\u201d\n\n5. Is your sharenting potentially exposing your child to danger in the real world?\n\n\u201cPhotographs and videos accompanied by information about a child\u2019s school, age, or location may expose children to online grooming,\u201d says Claire. \u201cThe metadata behind photographs used in conjunction with technologies which facilitate user tagging, automated facial recognition and compilation of disparate pieces of information, can also provide third parties with significant amounts of personal information about children\u2019s identity, location and friends.\u201c\n\n6. Imagine it was about you. How would you feel?\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a helpful hack that parents can use to reflect on whether or not to share a pic or piece of information,\u201d says Leah.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself if you would be surprised or embarrassed to find that very same type of information online about yourself. For instance, let's pretend that your parents had taken out an ad in your local newspaper when you were four years old to tell everyone in town that you were finally potty-trained. Now let's pretend that local newspaper finally got around to putting all its old editions online, so anyone who Googles you can find this story. If you would be upset, don't share potty training or similar types of private information about your kids. Just because you can tell the world with a few clicks or swipes, instead of having to take out an ad in print, doesn't mean it's a good idea!\u201d\n\nListen to this episode of the Woman's Hour parenting podcast here.
