In fact, some the analysts have pointed out the paradox of easing could actually exacerbate the slowdown in growth as it would make EU rates even lower and thus make saving much more difficult.\n\nIn the EZ, unlike in US savers traditionally allocate the vast majority of their funds to fixed income instruments rather than equities. With rates already negative across the region, saving becomes even more difficult, requiring more and more capital thus dampening demand. More QE, therefore, creates a vicious rather a virtuous cycle with respect to growth and not only becomes ineffective but rather counterproductive.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Draghi and the ECB council are constrained by the rules of the region which do not allow coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities. Over the past several months EU policymakers have become keenly aware of this problem and there may be some activity behind the scenes to create a much more united response to the problem. Any real action, however, will have to wait for Mr. Draghi\u2019s successor Ms. Legarde who is well skilled at building consensus across a wide swath of political institutions. For now, the markets may simply want to see if Mr. Draghi delivers a temporary shot of adrenaline to the financial system by reviving QE and repairing the balance sheets of the region\u2019s banking sector.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, DAX, Nikkei 225.
