And the guy behind him, I see that guy coming at me. I thought he had a gun. I thought he was going to shoot me. But it was a taser.\n\n'It seemed liked everything was in slow motion. It felt like so long before they actually came toward me... He slams me against the back wall, my head really cracks against this wall. I see the red flash from the taser and he jams it into the ribs on my right side. Actually breaks my rib.'\n\nShe claims workers inside the room saw the attack but waited 80 minutes before calling police.\n\nAt the time of the attack, the NYPD released surveillance photos (above) of the two suspects accused of beating Shapiro but so far no has been arrested in the case\n\nShapiro said a lawyer who was walking by and saw her collapse on the street called 911.\n\nShe was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital but left the following morning so she could bail out her son.
