Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip about you. Their opinions aren't your problem.\n\n'You stay kind, committed to love and free in your authenticity. No matter what they do or say don't you dare ever doubt your worth or the beauty of your truth. Just keep on shining like you do.\n\n'This is just a little post to say that anything remotely negative written on my Instagram will be deleted and you will be blocked (sounds savage right?!!! I'm so dramatic!)\n\n'But seriously, when you're about to write something on someone's page ask yourself this: 'would I say it to their face?!' And if the answer is no... just don't write it.\n\n'It's straight up that simple (mad right?!) My Instagram is a place of warmth, authenticity, humour and positivity- so hate of any kind won't be tolerated.'\n\nWow!

(nothing against Barry's, Barnsley, Sharon's or stoke there btw guys... I just like an alliteration!).'\n\nMother, daughter time: Vicky's mother Caroll has flown to Bali with her for some quality time\n\nInstagram versus reality: Vicky shared many 'Instagram versus reality' snaps while in Bali\n\nSoaking it all in: The television personality bathed in a traditional Balinese bath\n\nThe Geordie Shore star then expressed her gratitude for her supportive followers, before begging others to be 'mindful.'\n\nShe concluded: 'I'm saying this here and honestly across the board I am very lucky to have mostly beautiful followers who practice support and kindness on the regular- for that I am so grateful and I love you all.\n\n'But for the few people who don't seem to grasp the gravity of their words I implore you to be mindful across all social media.\n\n'Kindness and compassion are much for fun to spread than hate and anger. Let those things go and start enjoying the parrrttttyyyyy Debbie downers!!\n\n'Namaste.. (yes I know I'm a joke, I've done yoga for about an hour and I'm already saying 'namaste'- I'm planning on going vegan next and also wearing an anklet.. Bali has claimed me..
