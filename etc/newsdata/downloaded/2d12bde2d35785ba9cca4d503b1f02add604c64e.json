Slate last month published a leaked transcript of a staff \u201ctown hall\u201d at the Times. \u201cWe built our newsroom to cover one story,\u201d executive editor Dean Baquet told employees, explaining that the paper\u2019s narrative \u201cwent from being a story about whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and obstruction of justice to being a more head-on story about the president\u2019s character.\u201d The new story, he said, \u201crequires deep investigation into people who peddle hatred.\u201d\n\nMr. Baquet makes the Times sound like an advocacy organization working against Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election. Such organizations are regulated by campaign-finance statutes. So are other corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, that engage in electioneering speech. But those laws exempt media organizations, provided they are not owned by a political party, committee or candidate.\n\nThe justification for this favored treatment is the media\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d role in public discourse and debate. But that has changed\u2014and not only because the media have become more partisan. \u201cWith the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media,\u201d the Supreme Court observed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), \u201cthe line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred.\u201d\n\nIllustration: David Klein\n\nLike the prerevolutionary French aristocracy, media institutions enjoy legal privileges whose rationale expired long ago. As a result, their exemption from campaign-finance law is vulnerable to constitutional challenge. \u201cWe have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers,\u201d the Citizens United court declared.\n\nThe justices also indicated that a statutory privilege would be difficult to uphold. \u201cThe Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.\u201d\n\nThe court could resolve the problem by declaring the exemption unconstitutional and applying campaign-finance laws to media organizations. But that would make journalism untenable.\n\nConsider the ban on \u201ccoordinated communications.\u201d Under current law, corporations and other independent organizations have the right to speak for or against a candidate, but they are forbidden to develop messages \u201cin cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate\u2019s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents.\u201d\n\nAfter the Times town-hall transcript was published last month, lawyer and author James Hasson noted that, in emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, \u201cmajor journalists were revealed to be explicitly coordinating with the [Hillary] Clinton campaign.\u201d Among them was a Times writer who \u201ctold HRC aide Jennifer Palmieri she could \u2018veto whatever [she] didn\u2019t want,\u2019 \u201d then \u201ccut parts she objected to\u201d from a story about Mrs. Clinton. A Politico reporter sent the DNC an entire story before publication.\n\nNews executives would argue that it is their role, not the government\u2019s, to police such ethical transgressions. They\u2019d be right. But the rule against coordinated communication would prohibit a vast amount of ordinary journalistic behavior, too\u2014from interviewing candidates and campaign staffers to editing and publishing opinion articles under their bylines.\n\nMoreover, any justification for that rule\u2014such as the fear of promoting corruption\u2014is equally applicable to media and nonmedia speakers, and becomes very weak when pure speech, such as news and commentary, is the issue.\n\nThe justices could protect everyone\u2019s right to speak and gather news by declaring the coordination rule unconstitutional as applied against anyone, as they invalidated the rule against independent corporate campaign expenditures in Citizens United. Most newspapers\u2014The Wall Street Journal is a notable exception\u2014editorialized in bitter opposition to that ruling. They may end up grateful they didn\u2019t get what they wished for.\n\nMessrs. Rivkin and Casey practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington.
