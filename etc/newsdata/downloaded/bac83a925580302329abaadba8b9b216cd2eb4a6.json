Gavin Newsom signed a package of laws \u201cto fight animal cruelty and promote animal welfare,\u201d according to a state news release. Other laws ban animals, including elephants and bears, being used in circus acts, and the prohibition of hunting or killing bobcats in the state.\n\nThe fur law, which will go in effect in January 2023, would no longer allow the manufacture, sell, offer for sale, display for sale, trade, donate or otherwise distribute the products in the state. It applies to clothing, handbags, shoes, slippers, hats or key chains that contain fur. Each violation carries a civil penalty.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a leader when it comes to animal welfare and today that leadership includes banning the sale of fur,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cBut we are doing more than that. We are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames. Just YouTube the videos showing the cruel way these animals \u2013 often stripped from their mothers as babies \u2014 are trained to do dangerous tricks. It\u2019s deeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nThe fur industry contributes to the suffering and death of more than 100 million animals worldwide each year, according to the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nNearly 8,000 PETA supporters supported the ban in letters to their representatives.\n\n\u201cThis lifesaving measure will prevent animals from being beaten, electrocuted, and skinned alive for environmentally toxic items that compassionate shoppers no longer want and top designers no longer use,\u201d PETA wrote in a news release.\n\nThe measure was opposed by the fur industry.\n\n\u201cChalk this up as a victory for a radical vegan agenda using fur as the first step,\u201dKeith Kaplan of the Fur Information Council of America said after passage of the bill last month. \u201cIn the end, there will be no positive impact on animal welfare.\u201d\n\nExempted are leather, cowhide and shearling, as well as fur products used for religious purposes.\n\nTaxidermy products \u2014 fur from an animal lawfully taken with a hunting license \u2014 are allowed.\n\nAnother law protects California\u2019s wild and domestic horses from slaughter. This includes the purchaser of an animal at auction to sign a sworn statement agreeing to comply with Penal Code provisions on the slaughter and sale of horses or horsemeat for human consumption.\n\nAlso, more animals are added to the import and trade prohibition of dead animals and dead animal parts: iguana, skink, caiman, hippopotamus, and three types of lizards.\n\nSince 1970, California banned the sale of alligator and crocodile skins, and a new law.\n\nLaws in Hawaii, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey, ban the use of most animals in circuses.\n\nDomesticated dogs, cats and horses would still be allowed in circuses, and rodeos aren\u2019t affected.\n\n\u201cIn yet another nod to pressure from activist groups, millions of California youth will no longer be able to experience the thrill of a circus performance featuring beautiful, well cared for animals,\u201d the\n\nSouthwest California Legislative Council said before the bill signing.", "description": "Oct. 12 (UPI) \u2014 California became the new first state in the nation to ban the sale of new fur products.
