Though it did retain the original cam covers and cylinder head\n\nOnce the shell had been fully pieced together, it received a coat of Opalescent Silver Grey paint and polished for a staggering 60 hours to reach a perfect finish.\n\nAs for the cabin, the interior team fitted new electronics, a replacement dashboard and period-correct black leather seats, dials and pedal box.\n\nAs you might expect from a classic car that's been left standing in a bush for three decades, most of the engine components were beyond repair too.\n\nThat said, the original cam covers and cylinder head were salvaged and polished back to their best.\n\nA new stainless-steel sports exhaust and tubular manifold had to be found to replace the written-off standard parts.\n\nJust about every remaining component had to be painstakingly sourced or hand-crafted by the British firm's in-house team\n\nThe interior team at E-Type UK had to hand-craft a bespoke dashboard and fit all-new electronics to replace those that perished while the car stood outside for years\n\nWhile many of the parts were made in house, some were sourced from specialist spares providers - such as this red rear tailgate\n\nWhile the intention was to keep everything as authentic as possible, the car's new custodian requested that some modern upgrades were made in order for them to enjoy the vehicle on a regular basis.\n\nThis included an upgraded fast road specification with high-lift cams, a balanced and lightened crank and a five-speed gearbox to make it easier to drive and significantly more reliable.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Marcus Holland, owner of E-Type UK, said the car had required all the expertise his team had to take it from a bush-bound wreck to a museum-worthy beauty.\n\nOnce the shell had been fully pieced together, it received a coat of Opalescent Silver Grey paint\n\nAccording to the rebuild report, the car was then polished for a staggering 60 hours to reach a perfect finish\n\nThe team is pictured here dropping the full rebuilt engine block back into the car's bay\n\nSpeaking about the project, Marcus Holland, owner of E-Type UK, said the car had required all the expertise his team had to take it from a bush-bound wreck to a museum-worthy beauty\n\n'We are incredibly proud and privileged to have been given the opportunity to complete a full restoration of the 10th Jaguar E-type Series 1 4.2 RHD FHC to come off the production line,' he beamed.\n\n'This historic sportscar certainly came with its own unique challenges, bringing out the best from our in-house team through the extent and quality of the work required.\n\n'We have seen and completed a number of \"bush-find\" restorations, but this must be one of the most significant E-Type UK has ever undertaken.\n\n'Learning of its wonderful history, and being able to restore another Jaguar classic to its former glory has been a pleasure.\n\n'It is now back on Britain\u2019s roads, upholding the incredible legacy of the E-type and ready to be enjoyed for the first time in over thirty years.'\n\nThe dashboard received a full array of new dials and switches. A gearknob was added, as you can see in pictures below\n\nWhat would have been a painstaking process for the E-Type UK team has meant that a piece of Jaguar's history has been saved\n\nFinished in all its glory: A new wood-trimmed steering wheel and specially built pedal box have been fitted in the cabin\n\nPeriod-correct black leather seats were source and reupholstered along with the rest of the hide in the cabin\n\nWhile it is unknown if the significance of the car being the 10th ever model will have much of an impact on its worth, Hagerty Classic Car Values says a spotless example would fetch up to \u00a3125,000 on today's market.\n\nEven one in a not-perfect condition is predicted to cost a collector upward of \u00a382,000, the classic car valuations experts estimate.\n\nThat's just a fraction of the value of a barn find revealed last month.\n\nA 1969 Lamborghini Miura, preserved and restored in a wooden shed in the Black Forest, southwest Germany, is expected to sell at auction in October for a price in excess of \u00a31million.\n\nBritish beauty: It's hard to imagine how the car looked before the British company worked tirelessly to restore it\n\nEven the spoked wheels have been replaced with the correct replacements in all their polished brilliance\n\nA new stainless-steel sports exhaust and tubular manifold had to be found to replace the written-off standard parts", "description": "We've seen plenty of barn finds in the past, where classic cars have been found in a dilapidated state in someone's shed or garage.
