Richie made an appearance all in white, wearing a tank top and shorts underneath an oversized blazer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always tried to be myself with fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to express myself through fashion. I feel like being yourself is very important.\u201d\n\nModels posed in the lilac field had lavender braided into their hair and wore dresses with sequined floral designs. On a bright orange stage, the models posed in black and white while bright orange teddy bears were strewn around them.\n\nSuki Waterhouse was also among the guests, dressed in a white silk halter with low-slung satin trousers.\n\nIn another of Bendet\u2019s dreamscapes - a powder blue stage - a bakery display case was set up with matching candy, macaroons and pastries. Models wore pops of electric red, from a leafy detail on a blouse to a baroque pattern on a dress with billowing sleeves.\n\nElsewhere, one long skirt included a pattern of figures resembling Bendet\u2019s likeness in a floral scene.\n\n\u201cTo me, color is like therapy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the right color for you, when you walk into a room that\u2019s all decorated in beautiful colors, it really uplifts.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Stacey Bendet, creative director of Alice + Olivia, created a dreamscape in color on nine monochrome backdrops as models posed Monday for a presentation at New York Fashion Week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ragan Clark"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/fashion_week_-_alice__olivia_68308_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
