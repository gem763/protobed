But what if you could wear Godzilla on your wrist?\n\nSeiko Watches has teamed up with Toho Cinemas to celebrate two big things: the 20th anniversary of the invention of Grand Seiko\u2019s original spring drive mechanism and the 65th anniversary of Godzilla\u2018s theatrical release. With both things originating in Japan, they thought, \u201cHey, why not do a collaboration?\u201d\n\nThis is the Grand Seiko Godzilla watch. It\u2019s got an imposing-looking, sleek design dominated by reds and blacks that will only be sold in 650 units total. The dial is a deep crimson while the hands and marks are smooth silver. Also, it\u2019s visible by day or not with the help of Grand Seiko\u2019s Lumibright technology that absorb\u2019s the sun\u2019s energy during the day and releases it slowly at night.\n\n\u25bc The handle has scaly-looking skin, just like the big monster himself.\n\nOn the back of the watch is the real surprise; you\u2019ll find a special etching of Godzilla smashing the streets of Ginza (the neighborhood home to Seiko Watches) along with the date of the year of its release, 2019.\n\n\u25bc This is what you can show to the less cool people that don\u2019t recognize the watch upon first glance.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the price tag on this bad boy? Since Grand Seiko is a big name and Godzilla is even bigger, you can probably infer what that means for the value of the watch. It clocks in (no pun intended) at 1.3 million yen. They go on sale Nov 9 in Japan, and later on worldwide.\n\nSources: Japaaan Magazine, PR Times\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Japanese jeweler\u2019s glittering gold Godzilla is amazingly detailed, shockingly expensive\n\n-- Godzilla gets official Tokyo residency papers, copies being given out free to fans\n\n-- Shin Godzilla set to leave an imprint on your next drinking adventure\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/12/seiko-watches-makes-limited-number-of-godzilla-watches-for-65th-anniversary/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "The whole world is crazy about Godzilla; there are Godzilla guitars being made, Godzilla bento boxes, and even a Godzilla constellation.
