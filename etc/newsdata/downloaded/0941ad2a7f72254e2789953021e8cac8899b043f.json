For 30 minutes they played the sound of cat and dog food adverts on loop. They also put two identical phones in a silent room.\n\nThe security specialists kept apps open for Facebook, Instagram, Chrome, SnapChat, YouTube, and Amazon with full permissions granted to each platform.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is encryption?\n\nThey then looked for ads related to pet food on each platform and webpage they subsequently visited. They also analysed the battery usage and data consumption on the phones during the test phase.\n\nThey repeated the experiment at the same time for three days, and noted no relevant pet food adverts on the \"audio room\" phones and no significant spike in data or battery usage.\n\nThe activity seen on phones in the \"audio room\" and the silent rooms were similar. They did record data being transferred from the devices - but it was at low levels and nowhere near the quantity seen when virtual assistants like Siri or Hey Google are active.\n\nJames Mack, systems engineer at Wandera, said: \"We observed that the data from our tests is much lower than the virtual assistant data over the 30-minute time period, which suggests that the constant recording of conversations and uploading to the cloud is not happening on any of these tested apps.\n\n\"If it was, we'd expect data usage to be as high as the virtual assistants' data consumption,\" Mr Mack said.\n\nFor years tech giants have batted away suggestions that they are using the microphones in our mobiles to spy.\n\nLast year, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg was asked if this was happening as part of his testimony before the US Senate to which he flatly denied it.\n\nHowever, as distrust in tech giants has grown, many users still feel like it's happening to them.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that most of the Android phone apps seem to consume significantly more data in the silent rooms with many iOS apps using more in the audio-filled rooms. Analysts say they are unsure why this is the case but have determined to carry on researching the issue.\n\nRegardless, the company co-founder and chief executive Eldar Tuvey is confident that the overall results show that any secret transfer of significant data is not happening.\n\n\"I would put my name to the research and say that we found no evidence at all this was happening on the platforms we tested. It might be happening in a way we don't know about - but I would say it's highly unlikely,\" Mr Tuvey said.\n\nThe results won't surprise those in the information security industry who've known for years that the truth is that tech giants know so much about us that they don't actually need to listen to our conversations to serve us targeted adverts.\n\nThe reality is that advertisers have sophisticated ways of profiling users.\n\nLocation data, browsing history and tracking pixels, for example all provide enough information to predict what you might be thinking about buying.\n\nImage copyright Press Association Image caption The reality is that advertisers have sophisticated ways of profiling users\n\nThey can also link you up to friends via social media information and guess that you might be interested in the things they are searching for.\n\nThese techniques are constantly improving and evolving, too.\n\nMobile advertising and security expert Soteris Demetriou, from Imperial College London, said: \"The adverts that you see are a result of huge amounts of data that the companies have about you. They share a vast amount of information across advertising networks powered by machine-learning algorithms that are extremely powerful.\n\n\"They now have the ability to effectively know what you could be interested in before even you do,\" Dr Demetriou said.\n\nThere are of course instances where some apps have been found to record user activity for advertising purposes.\n\nLast June, researchers at Northeastern University in the US state of Massachusetts tested 17,000 mobile apps from various Android app stores around the world.\n\nThey found no evidence of listening - but they did discover some relatively small applications were sending screenshots and even videos of user phone activities to third parties. Although this was done for development purposes and not for advertising.\n\nIt's also accepted that nation-state groups routinely attack the mobile devices of high-level targets for espionage purposes.\n\nIn May, WhatsApp admitted that hackers had managed to remotely install surveillance software onto devices through its app.\n\nWhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said the attack targeted a \"select number\" of users and was orchestrated by \"an advanced cyber-actor\".
