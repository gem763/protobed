The news was communicated by the Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, via Twitter.\n\nThe women\u2019s mission is to replace a faulty battery charging unit on the outside of the station, which failed last weekend, Nasa said.\n\nAstronauts and cosmonauts have completed more than 200 spacewalks during the construction and maintenance of the International Space Station, but only 15 women have ever been on a spacewalk, always accompanied by men. There hasn\u2019t been an all-female event in more than a half-century of space walking.\n\nNasa unveils spacesuits to be worn by first woman on the moon Read more\n\nThe walk was originally scheduled to take place more than six months ago, involving Koch and the Nasa astronaut Anne McClain, but the exercise had to be delayed because Nasa did not have enough of the correctly sized suits available and ready to use on the station. There was only one useable medium-sized suit available in time, and the women needed one each.\n\nMcClain came back to Earth in June and Nasa has since blasted a second medium spacesuit up to the station, so that the walk \u2013 which could take place on Thursday or Friday \u2013 could happen.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that over the next couple of years we\u2019re having a lot of medium-suit people fly, and so that\u2019s the sweet spot,\u201d the program manager for the International Space Station, Kirk Shireman, told a press briefing earlier this month.\n\nSeparately, the agency has unveiled prototypes of its next-generation spacesuits to be worn inside the Orion spacecraft and on the surface of the moon, because American astronauts are scheduled to return there as early as 2024.\n\nOne is designed for walking on the moon. The other is a bright orange pressure suit to be worn when astronauts launch from Earth and return.\n\nNasa recently demonstrated that the new suits will allow astronauts to bend, squat and lift their arms above their heads \u2013 a facility space suits have restricted until now.\n\n\u201cThis is the first suit we\u2019ve designed in about 40 years,\u201d Chris Hansen, a manager at Nasa\u2019s spacesuit design office, said. \u201cWe want systems that allow our astronauts to be scientists on the surface of the Moon.\u201d\n\nAmy Ross, NASA\u2019s lead spacesuit engineer, said: \u201cBasically, my job is to take a basketball, shape it like a human, keep them alive in a harsh environment and give them the mobility to do their job.\u201d\n\nThe new lunar suit should also help overcome NASA\u2019s spacesuit sizing issues: it is a one-size-fits-all garment designed for both men and women.\n\nSix people are serving on the space station\u2019s currentmission: Koch, Meir, fellow NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan; Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Skvortsov and Oleg Skripochka; and the European Space Agency\u2019s Luca Parmitano.", "description": "Christina Koch and Jessica Meir to make history after delay over suit sizes available at station", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291ad85edcc6202c90247d896308922644bfc3d2/85_0_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c9717c71111501c00b0f1134aab6fb2a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
