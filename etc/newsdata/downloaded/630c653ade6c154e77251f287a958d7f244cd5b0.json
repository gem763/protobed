But we can\u2019t go back and so instead we are looking forward and doing everything we can to minimise the chances of anything like this happening again.\u201d\n\nUniversities minister Chris Skidmore said: \u201cToday\u2019s new guidance is a welcome step in promoting the safety and wellbeing of students, and warning them of the dangers of initiation activities and especially excessive alcohol consumption. It is a shame that such a tragic case brought this issue to light, but it is important that students will now have access to increased information and that universities can use their position to warn students of the dangers involved in such activities.\n\n\u201cRaising awareness on the potential impact of initiations and excessive alcohol on physical and mental health is vital so that the hundreds of thousands of students starting and returning to their studies this month feel their universities are prioritising their welfare and safety.\u201d", "description": "Universities need to do more to educate students about the dangers of initiations and excessive drinking to prevent any more tragic deaths from taking place in the future, new guidance suggests.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/19/10/ed-farmer1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
