I\u2019ve never talked about crystals. I\u2019ve never had a crystal onstage with me.\u201d\n\nThe wellness author expressed that she thought \"something far more sinister\" was behind the amplified scrutiny of her record and went on to claim that \"left-wing voices\u201d pushed stories that were \u201cout-and-out lies,\" adding, \"Unfortunately, the vicious smears have not been coming from Republicans.\u201d\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON CAUGHT ON A HOT MIC SAYING 'CONSERVATIVES ARE NICER' TO HER THAN THE LEFT\n\n\u201cThe words were all the same: \u2018anti-science,\u2019 \u2018anti-medicine,\u2019 \u2018dangerous,\u2019 \u2018crazy\u2019 and \u2018grifter.\u2019 I mean, you couldn\u2019t be clearer. Those were the words repeated in all of the articles, all of the stories. They were meant to create suspicion in people\u2019s minds,\" she said.\n\n\"They were meant to create doubt, lest anybody even think of taking me seriously as a candidate. But I think at this point, just as that smear campaign cast doubt on my credibility, the fact that I\u2019ve been out there, that people have heard me more themselves, people have seen my clips, enough has begun to cast doubt on the credibility of those who have projected onto me such mischaracterization.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, who failed to qualify for the October Democratic debate, accused the media of \"dictating the process,\" offering a simple \"duh\" when asked if debate moderators offering more questions to top-tier candidates was evidence of bias.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHer campaign announced this week that it has raised $3 million in the third quarter, far overshadowed by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who both raised over $20 million, but she expressed her optimism as a candidate going forward.\n\n\u201cMy campaign is like a bonsai tree,\u201d Williamson explained. \u201cA bonsai tree has everything that a big tree has. But it\u2019s within the limits of those glass walls. So, I have everything every campaign has, just less of it.\"", "description": "Spiritual guru and 2020 hopeful Marianne Williamson had some harsh words for \"left-wing voices\" who portray her as a \"crystal woo woo lady.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
