Back in those periods, property companies couldn\u2019t get debt with a tenure much longer than two or three years. In the current low-rate environment, there\u2019s no shortage of cheap 20-year money around; Steinberg says Dexus\u2019 average tenure is about seven years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have long-term debt you won\u2019t get caught when the cycle turns,\u201d he explained.\n\nSteinberg is blunt about the outlook for the retail sector \u2013 there\u2019s simply too much retail space in Australia, and the sector will need to think very carefully about the creation of future space.\n\nMirvac chief executive Susan Lloyd-Hurtwitz also sounded a warning for retailers, retail landlords and investors who are hoping to see the recent tax cuts and interest rates put a bounce in the sector.\n\nThe switch among consumers from necessity to choice is far more transformational than any short-term bump in economic conditions.\n\nNobody in this room ever has to go to a shop for anything, if you so desire,\u201d Lloyd-Hurtwitz told the summit.\n\n\u201cThat to me is a much more profound shift than stimulus and falling retail.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that Mirvac is giving up on the retail sector. Lloyd-Hurtwitz points to numerous examples around the world of online retailers pushing into physical retail. These moves are not necessarily designed to boost sales, she says, but rather about creating an environment to showcase brands in a way that can\u2019t be done online.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to showcase, provide experiences, collect customers. Physical space still has a function \u2013 it will just change.\u201d", "description": "Dexus chief executive Darren Steinberg says fears of an asset bubble in commercial property ignore the different conditions that exist today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_89/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/46a962d8c5ff743a059830bddd5653cbf4e4728f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
