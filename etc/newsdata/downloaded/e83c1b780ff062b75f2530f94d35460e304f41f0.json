As a result, readers should always check whether Begbies Traynor Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nView our latest analysis for Begbies Traynor Group\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Begbies Traynor Group paid out 120% of profit in the past year, which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Begbies Traynor Group generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 42% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's good to see that while Begbies Traynor Group's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nAIM:BEG Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Begbies Traynor Group's earnings per share have dropped 10% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Begbies Traynor Group's dividend payments are broadly unchanged compared to where they were ten years ago. When earnings are declining yet the dividends are flat, typically the company is either paying out a higher portion of its earnings, or paying out of cash or debt on the balance sheet, neither of which is ideal.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nHas Begbies Traynor Group got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's never great to see earnings per share declining, especially when a company is paying out 120% of its profit as dividends, which we feel is uncomfortably high. Yet cashflow was much stronger, which makes us wonder if there are some large timing issues in Begbies Traynor Group's cash flows, or perhaps the company has written down some assets aggressively, reducing its income. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Begbies Traynor Group.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Begbies...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tNfy_zIRLApYQq_A4ApIGw--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/3766c21bc9cc20d03f8d3563d76efe29", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
