First of all, OC Fashion the Shrimp Are Free But You Can Only Have One is an absolute mess. It is on some kind of yacht and there are runways on the top floor and lower floor and the floor in the middle is where the models are changing. Guests have to go from one level to the other for different shows. Okay, it actually isn\u2019t the worst idea to have a luxury fashion show in a venue that people don\u2019t get to visit too often. But then, before the shows start, the boat leaves the dock.\n\nOh, no no no no no no no no no NO. There are two things that you should never attend: a vegan potluck and a boat party where the boat goes sailing. That means you are stuck on that boat. What if the party is awful? What if you have another party to attend? What if your ex is onboard and you haven\u2019t spoken to him since you maybe possibly texted his mom his dick pic from a friend\u2019s phone so she wouldn\u2019t know it was from you? For this event, a boat cruise makes no sense. Most fashion shows take about 20 minutes at the most. Who wants to watch another lame fashion show of an unknown designer while cruising around Carona del Mar waiting for your one free shrimp to come back up?\n\nThis whole setup is a disaster, right down to the magazine that is placed on everyone\u2019s chairs. No, it is not Lydia McLaughlin\u2019s Nobleman; it is a publication called Basic. Seriously, did the organizers think it was a good idea for a third-tier fashion show to be giving out Basic magazine? I mean, what is even on the cover? A pumpkin-spice latte wearing Uggs with an avocado-toast stain on them?\n\nThe biggest disaster, though, seems to be the bathroom situation. A ship like this one is not built to have a hundred people downing bubbly to forget the mediocre clothes they\u2019re being forced to see. That makes the lavatory situation a bit untenable, as Braunwyn\u2019s mother, Dr. Deb, realizes when she tries to hit the head with her two Burner friends, Tokyo and Jessie, who are dressed like S&M backup dancers on a swingers\u2019 cruise. As she heads upstairs, a security guard asks her where she\u2019s going. She claims that he grabbed her arm, but he says that he just touched her. They get into a fight about it, and Deb, as most angry white women do, asks to see a manager.\n\nThis is when we are introduced to Kathy, the hero of this story. Kathy pulls her into a little room and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Dr. Deb responds, \u201cDr. Deb,\u201d which is ridiculous because that is not a name. Also, while the \u201cDr.\u201d inspires some confidence and deference, \u201cDeb\u201d just conjures up the lady in the office who keeps those little candies wrapped like strawberries on her desk. They pull the listener in opposite directions. It\u2019s sort of like being called Sir Squishy Belly III. Kathy says, \u201cI don\u2019t know you, sweetheart,\u201d with so much flippant condescension she has earned her place in my heart forever.\n\nThe situation does not seem to resolve itself and Deb returns downstairs to complain to her daughter about what is going on. Braunwyn (who probably paid a good chunk of money to have her daughter\u2019s line of dance clothes at this ill-fated three-hour tour) walks right up to Kathy and says, \u201cI think you need to apologize to my mother or we\u2019re going to have a very bad night.\u201d\n\nKathy comes back with, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to me and then we can have a conversation.\u201d They are both right. There was no need for Kathy to be so dismissive of Dr. Deb, but Braunwyn should have clarified what happened before demanding an apology. However, Kathy has no intention of apologizing and quickly gets attitude with Braunwyn. Standing across the room, Kelly Dodd, who can hear attitude like Jill Zarin can hear a potential Instagram endorsement deal, decides that she is going to come over and help Braunwyn with this situation.\n\nI love Kelly Dodd, but calling her in to help negotiate a tense situation is like throwing water on a grease fire; she\u2019s just going to make it spread and flare up in a remarkable way. Kelly starts telling Kathy to \u201cbe professional\u201d as Kathy and Braunwyn continue to yell at each other. (Oh, did I forget to mention that Braunwyn is wearing an enormous feather duster that she put some very visible shoulder pads into? Sorry, I am so amused by all this I can hardly paint an accurate picture.)\n\nKelly tells Kathy not to get loud. Kathy, who has been holding a microphone the whole time, says into that mic, \u201cI\u2019m working and I can be as loud as I want.\u201d Everyone who is still in the room hears. At that point I don\u2019t know how the producers didn\u2019t throw 17 million oranges at her. \u201cHere you go, Kathy,\u201d they should have said. \u201cYou\u2019re hired. What are you doing on Tuesday? Can you attend Vicki\u2019s birthday party?\u201d Not since Anthony the party planner on Real Houswives of Atlanta has someone working for the women been so in the wrong but so in the right at the exact same time.\n\nKelly starts calling Kathy a psycho and a lunatic, and Kathy, still using the mic to overpower everyone else, tells Kelly that is defamation and hits Kelly on the chin with the microphone. Kelly starts complaining about this and Tamra, in a stroke of genius, says, \u201cDid she just tap you or did she hit you like you hit Shannon on the head.\u201d Oh, watch out, boys and girls, the shrapnel is flying from all directions.\n\nKathy will not be deterred. Braunwyn leads Kelly away after the chin tap and tells her, \u201cThink of Rowan and Adeline. This is for the kids. It\u2019s their night.\u201d Braunwyn keeps saying her daughter\u2019s and Shannon\u2019s daughter\u2019s name like it\u2019s some sort of white-people incantation. \u201cRowan and Adeline. Rowan and Adeline. Rowan and Adeline.\u201d It sounds less like two girls\u2019 names and more like a line of bad floral-print tunics that would be sold at Kyle by Alene Too. Though Kelly walks away, Kathy does not stop, still saying into the mic, \u201cI\u2019m sick of people saying things that aren\u2019t true.\u201d This is amazing. We can\u2019t help but to stan.\n\nThen Kathy, presenting Rowan\u2019s collection, goes on a whole tirade in front of the crowd about \u201canti-bullying\u201d and what it is like to be verbally assaulted, and she is officially my petty hero. I have built a little shrine to her in my house, and every time someone cuts me in line, talks in the movie theater, or cuts me off on my bicycle, I think of small revenges and I offer up a sacrifice to St. Kathy. (That sacrifice is usually my mental health and well-being, but it is worth it to imagine a world where all movie-theater talkers have been forced into a room and made to watch all seasons of The Newsroom on repeat for eternity.)\n\nYes, there were other things that happened this episode \u2014 Tamra took Ryan to get an awful tattoo removed by a Big Brother winner, Shannon made her children into self-starters by ridiculously micromanaging them, Emily and Braunwyn rode horses and talked about absent fathers, Gina talked about how her ex showed up in her bedroom in the middle of the night unannounced and it is now being adapted into a Netflix horror movie \u2014 but really, the only thing I\u2019m ever going to want to remember about this episode or talk about is Kathy, your newest Housewife and the savior of this season.", "description": "Say hello to Kathy, the president of OC Fashion Better Part of an Afternoon and Booze Cruise and the savior of this season.
