I mean, I know that\u2019s a good thing because they\u2019re my children. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t do much. I genuinely just adore them in a way that I never knew that I could adore any little people.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, Levine and his Maroon 5 bandmates took the stage to perform their new single, \u201cMemories.\u201d\n\nThe track, which dropped last month, is an homage to the band\u2019s longtime manager, Jordan Feldstein, who died in 2017.\n\n\u2033[It\u2019s about] experiencing and suffering loss, which all of us share that in common,\u201d Levine said. \u201cSo this song came to me at a very interesting time. I\u2019ve never had a song about anything quite like this.\u201d\n\nOf Feldstein, who was the brother of actors Jonah Hill and Beanie Feldstein, Levine added, \u201cI miss him every day, and this is, to me, the best way to [pay] tribute.\u201d", "description": "On \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" the Maroon 5 frontman said he's having the \"greatest time\" after moving on from NBC's talent competition series.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9b44432100006601ab8ea4.jpeg?cache=wuqy7dqmrb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
