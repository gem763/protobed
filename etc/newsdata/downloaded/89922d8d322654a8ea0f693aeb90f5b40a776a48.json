On Wednesday night/Thursday morning, the BTC price plunged by nearly $600 out of nowhere, dropping the cryptocurrency to $9,600 from $10,150.\n\nMany traders immediately saw this as a sign that BTC was going to collapse lower, as it would have then resolved to the downside of a long-term descending triangle that has haunted bulls for months.\n\nBut, just as fast as Bitcoin plummeted, it rocketed back up. On Thursday, the cryptocurrency surged back through the key $10,000 support all the way to $10,300, managing to regain all the losses that it incurred just hours prior.\n\nThis confusing price action has left many traders stumped, wondering exactly what this odd bout of volatility implies for Bitcoin holders. According to a popular analyst, Bitcoin is decidedly in a bull trend, and shouldn\u2019t fall much further should bears manage to take over.\n\nBitcoin Price Still in Strong Spot\n\nAccording to CryptoKea, the worst-case scenario per his analysis of the Mayer Multiple (MM) \u2014 defined by putting BTC\u2019s current price over its 200-day moving average \u2014 the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d would see Bitcoin fall to a maximum of $9,200 over the next few days, no lower.\n\nIn an extensive Twitter thread that weighed on historical price action and trends, the analyst noted that he came to this conclusion by overlaying Bitcoin\u2019s price action prior to the 2016 halving on the current chart, using MM readings to determine price ranges.\n\n53/ UPDATE: Based on https://t.co/GMqRvPBltr, we have 226 days to go until the next halving (error in prior version: 144 days). So, how is BTC price in terms of Mayer Multiple (MM) doing compared to this time before halving 1 & 2? Let\u00b4s have a closer look \ud83d\udc47@TraceMayer pic.twitter.com/VxrMIO00fk \u2014 CryptoKea (@CryptoKea) September 19, 2019\n\nHis model shows that the \u201clows [could] be behind us in a few days\u201d. Kea did admit that this wasn\u2019t an explicit price prediction or target, but using historical analysis to determine Bitcoin\u2019s trends has proven to be very useful in the past.\n\nKea isn\u2019t the only one pointing towards the importance of the low-$9,000s. Prominent trader Josh Rager recently noted that the $9,400 support is a level of key importance, as BTC managed to bounce off it on three separate occasions.\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin didn\u2019t sweep that low \u2014 or the one that Kea mentioned, for that matter \u2014 is a clear sign that bulls remain in control of the Bitcoin price, depends the critics asserting that the cryptocurrency is in somewhat of an \u201cecho bubble\u201d.\n\n$BTC Not really worried unless price breaks and closes below $9400 again This is the area to keep an eye on pic.twitter.com/dLRAht4DD4 \u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) September 19, 2019\n\nWilly Woo, a partner for Adaptive Capital and a prominent on-chain metrics analyst for Bitcoin, has also remained bullish. In a recent stream published to the channel of trader Tone Vays, Woo explained that he is still seeing that Bitcoin is in an \u201cexpansion\u201d phase \u2014 which is often seen in bull markets, he proposes \u2014 not an unwinding of the January to June rally as some cynics have suggested.\n\nWoo went on to point out that the Realized Price \u2014 an indicator effectively giving insight into how much the market pay for each Bitcoin \u2014 is currently looking much like it did during the early stages of the previous bull market.\n\nHistory repeating would see a breakout to the upside in the coming months, one that could potentially bring BTC to trade on an order of magnitude about the 10,000s.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin has, to put it lightly, seen a helluva past 48 hours.
