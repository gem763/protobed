It might be nice to see more sun on the weekend.\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Mostly cloudy. Highs: Upper 70s and lower 80s.\n\nTonight: Mostly to partly cloudy. Lows: 60s.\n\nTomorrow: Partly to mostly sunny. Highs: Mid-80s.\n\nView the weather at Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nOur break in the heat continues today. Since it\u2019s mid-September, any more heat on the way shouldn\u2019t last too long. That said, we do have more in the forecast. First, a pretty decent weekend, especially if you don\u2019t mind the clouds today.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Saturday): Clouds remain lodged in place. With the wind turning to come from the south, we begin to see warmer air filter into the region, but it won\u2019t be too warm just yet. Highs are mainly in the upper 70s and lower 80s. Humidity is low-moderate, so it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a bother. Winds are from the south around 10 mph. There could be an isolated shower or rumble, but that should mainly stay west of here. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: We could have some breaks in the evening, and they\u2019ll probably become more numerous late night. Totally kicking the clouds seems unlikely, though. Lows settle across the 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend...\n\nTomorrow (Sunday): We might still have some clouds to deal with in the morning, but they\u2019ll tend to dissipate with time. By midday into afternoon, we\u2019re looking at mostly sunny conditions and higher temperatures. Highs head for the mid-80s as humidity is moderate. There is a slightly better chance of an afternoon shower or storm compared to today, although activity should remain isolated. Winds are from the south around 10 mph. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Skies should remain clear for most or all of the night. Lows settle across the 60s, and winds are light. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nWe turn up the heat again on a sun-filled Monday. Let\u2019s hope that option on the natural thermostat is close to broken. Highs should head well into the 80s and probably near or past 90 in some spots. Add moderate humidity and we\u2019re talking heat indexes approaching the mid-90s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA cold front passing Monday night should set up a cooler Tuesday. Clouds may be numerous as well, but we\u2019ll keep fingers crossed for some sunshine. Highs head for 80 or so.
