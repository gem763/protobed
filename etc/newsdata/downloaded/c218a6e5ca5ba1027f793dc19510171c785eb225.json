I know that Ukrainian officials understood.\"\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s alleged insistence that the two leaders discuss a prospective investigation into Biden, one of the president\u2019s political opponents, casts his July 25 conversation with Zelenskiy in a new light.\n\nDuring the call, a rough summary of which was released by the White House Wednesday, Trump repeatedly encouraged Zelenskiy to work with Attorney General William Barr and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, to probe Biden\u2019s role in the dismissal of the country\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy talk to the press during a meeting in New York, on Sept. 25, 2019, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nIn an interview with ABC News in April 2019, Shokin said he believed Biden pressured the government to fire him because he was leading an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian oil and gas company where Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, had a seat on the board of directors.\n\nBut the assertion that Biden acted to help his son has been undercut by widespread criticism of Shokin from several high-profile international leaders, including members of the European Union and International Monetary Fund, who said Biden's recommendation was well justified and that Shokin had been removed because of widely shared concerns he was obstructing efforts to root out entrenched corruption in his office and Ukraine\u2019s judicial system.\n\n(MORE: Read the transcript of Trump's call with the Ukraine president)\n\nDuring a bilateral meeting with Trump on Wednesday in New York, Zelenskiy reaffirmed that he has no interest in getting Ukraine involved in U.S. politics and denied that Trump had pressed him to investigate Biden.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be involved in ... elections of USA,\" Zelenskiy said. \"No, you heard that we had, I think, a good phone call. It was normal, we spoke about many things, and you read it that nobody pushed it, nobody pushed me.\"\n\nFallout from the release of a transcript chronicling Trump\u2019s July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart has sparked partisan furor in the United States. But in Ukraine, according to Leschenko, the prospective investigation was part of an effort by a Ukrainian official to curry favor with the Americans.\n\nPHOTO: Ukrainian lawmaker Sergiy Leschenko speaks and shows documents to journalists in front of a courthouse in Kyiv, Ukraine, on May 13, 2019.
