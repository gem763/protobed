Shape Created with Sketch. 25 books that should have never been made into films 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director's adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It's the only one of Lynch's films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year\u2019s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better. Universal Pictures 3/26 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma's preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production's many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon's follow-up book, The Devil's Candy. Warner Bros 4/26 Billy Bathgate (1991) 1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow's beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character's narration \u2013 a huge reason behind the novel's success. Buena Vista Pictures 5/26 The Scarlet Letter (1995) The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as \u201ca perfect work of the American imagination,\" the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joff\u00e9 strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne's pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama. Buena Vista Pictures 6/26 Battlefield Earth (2000) To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard\u2019s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in \u201cWorst Movies Ever\u201d infamy, effectively ending Travolta\u2019s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper\u2019s before it even started. Warner Bros Pictures 7/26 Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) Louis de Berni\u00e8res's Captain Corelli's Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version \u2013 from the same British company that made Notting Hill \u2013 lost all traces of the novel's heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake. Miramax Films 8/26 The Time Machine (2002) The beauty of HG Wells\u2019s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells's great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce's lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story. Warner Bros Pictures 9/26 Dreamcatcher (2003) There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film's late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful. Warner Bros Pictures 10/26 Enduring Love (2004) Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u2019s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig\u2019s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed \u2013 the man who becomes obsessed with him \u2013 are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it. Path\u00e9 Distribution 11/26 The Perfect Catch (2005) Nick Hornby adaptations don\u2019t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby\u2019s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a 'girlfriend\u2019 role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby\u2019s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing. 20th Century Fox 12/26 The Da Vinci Code (2006) The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn't have existed had this one not been so successful. Sony Pictures Releasing 13/26 Eragon (2006) 20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation \u2013 one where all of the source materials' sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen. 20th Century Fox 14/26 Running with Scissors (2006) Augusten Burroughs\u2019s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy\u2019s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It\u2019s no wonder this sunk without a trace. TriStar Pictures 15/26 The Golden Compass (2007) In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman\u2019s superb His Dark Materials trilogy \u2013 or rather, the first book Northern Lights \u2013 was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007's The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising. Entertainment Film Distributors 16/26 The Time Traveller's Wife (2009) Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s The Time Traveller's Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there's nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. New Line Cinema 17/26 Cloud Atlas (2012) Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it's meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell's sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it's an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it. Focus Features 18/26 The Hobbit (2012-2014) Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book's material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three. Warner Bros Pictures 19/26 The Book Thief (2013) The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn't help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent. 20th Century Fox 20/26 The Great Gatsby (2013) No adaptation of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann's 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald\u2019s delicate story-telling. Warner Bros Pictures 21/26 The Giver (2014) Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katie Holmes) very little to do. The Weinstein Company 22/26 Kill Your Friends (2015) John Niven's Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can't be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows \u2013 the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox. StudioCanal 23/26 The Girl on the Train (2016) Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn\u2019s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance \u2013 and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. Universal Pictures 24/26 Me Before You (2016) The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn't help, either. Clarke's performance as the paid companion to Claflin\u2019s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated. Warner Bros Pictures 25/26 The Dark Tower (2017) While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King's finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared \u2013 but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel's 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Sony Pictures Releasing 26/26 On Chesil Beach (2017) Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in \u2013 the Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007). Lionsgate 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director's adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It's the only one of Lynch's films the director has publicly disowned.
