People were wondering who the new guy they had never heard of was? Well, there he was! Check him out.\n\n\u201cFor many candidates, the number of followers is a key part of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d said Michael Boroian, the founder of the executive search firm Sterling International, which specializes in the luxury industry.\n\nAlso, of course, relatively young, untested designers tend to be cheaper, at a time when geopolitics and the possibility of a recession are sending tremors through the industry.\n\n\u201cThe existing creative directors have been making a ton of money,\u201d Mr. Boroian said. \u201cOne of the people I know was on an eight million euro package. The new crew tends to go from 500,000 euros to two million, though the latter would have to have a following, so from the very beginning their name would be a mover of product. But the compensation structure is less onerous for the brand. And in return, they get loyalty.\u201d\n\nIn fact, a brand gets more than that: It also gets a name that will not overshadow the brand name, because most of these designers were second in command, working behind the scenes before being elevated. And, said Mr. Hecquet: \u201cThey don\u2019t have any bad or comfortable habits. They are not used to having a huge team.\u201d", "description": "A generational shift is happening in the corridors of power.
