They\u2019re going to have to re-rate their expectations. You\u2019ve got a market that this year has traded off of hopes for coordinated global central bank easing. That\u2019s the only reason why we\u2019re up 20% year to date. We\u2019re certainly not there because of fundamentals.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Joseph Zidle, Blackstone\u2019s BX, -1.25% chief investment strategist, explaining to CNBC on Wednesday why stocks could be headed for a beatdown.\n\nHe\u2019s looking for the Fed to cut rates by a quarter point on Wednesday, and then again in October, but then that\u2019s it. Zidle warned that could rattle a market \u201cdemanding upwards of 100 basis points\u201d on top of what we got in July.\n\nHe said he sees Fed Chief Powell wrestling with inflation at home while also looking to align U.S. rates with the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cThe markets are saying to the Fed, \u2018Think globally. Rates around the world are so low, you\u2019ve got to cut our rates lower.\u2019 But the Fed is going to have to respond to local data,\u201d Zidle explained. \u201cThey are going to have to act locally which I think is going to constrain them from giving the market all it wants.\u201d\n\nZidle\u2019s end-of-year target for the S&P is at 2,875, a decline of about 4% from current levels. He does, however, see potential downside. \u201cAny bull market can produce 10-20% pullbacks. We saw that in the fourth quarter of last year,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out something that\u2019s on the order of 10-20%.\u201d\n\nThe Dow DJIA, +0.13% bounced into positive territory on Wednesday, closing just barely in positive territory, along with the S&P SPX, +0.03% . The Nasdaq COMP, -0.11%, however, ended in the red.\n\nWatch the full interview:", "description": "Joseph Zidle, Blackstone\u2019s chief investment strategist, explains why stocks are poised for a beatdown.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR535_cnbc_MG_20190918113211.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
