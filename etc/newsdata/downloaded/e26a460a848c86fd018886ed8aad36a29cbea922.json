The RVs, packed with UFO enthusiasts, conspiracy theorists and those just looking to party in a remote area of the Nevada desert for \u201cStorm Area 51,\u201d a gathering that began as an internet joke but is expected to attract several thousand people here over the next three days.\n\n\u201cLook around. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s here,\u201d said Connie West, co-owner of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, which is hosting one of two competing \u201cAlienstock\u201d events this weekend.\n\nThe original \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us\u2019\u201d Facebook post was supposed to be a joke inspired by a recent documentary on the once secret military research site known as Area 51, part of the Nevada Test and Training Range, where conspiracy theorists allege the U.S. government is engaged in extraterrestrial research.\n\nMore than 2 million people on Facebook signed up.\n\nAttendees of \"Alienstock\" speak to reporters in Rachel, Nev., ahead of this weekend's gathering of UFO enthusiasts.

According to police, the two had driven roughly 3 miles into the property at the time of their arrest.\n\nLincoln County Commissioner Varlin Higbee said more than 300 law enforcement personnel and first responders from across the state have been dispatched to handle any possible attempts to \u201cstorm\u201d the gates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared,\u201d Higbee said.\n\nSigns warn unwanted visitors not to trespass at the Nevada Test and Training Range.

(The government didn\u2019t reveal until decades later that the crash was of an unmanned craft that was part of a top-secret program to monitor Soviet weapons tests.)\n\nRumors surrounding Area 51 date back to 1955, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the CIA to create the Groom Lake test facility. Originally it was used to test top-secret warcraft, like the U-2 spy plane. Since then, the base has been an operating, highly active and highly classified location that remains the center of UFO intrigue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the sky for the last month or so \u2014 well, for the last 31 years,\u201d said Pamela Kinsey, a waitress at Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn. \u201cSome stuff that I\u2019ve seen that I never saw before that has gotten massive.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "An event that began as a Facebook joke is expected to attract several thousand people to a remote area of the Nevada desert over the next three days.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JXIpWejwldPuhDfE2jKzlA--~B/aD04MDI7dz0xNDI2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a37a3940-dbc4-11e9-bfdf-431382288055"}
