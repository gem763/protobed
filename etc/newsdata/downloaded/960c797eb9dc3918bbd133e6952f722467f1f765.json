The partnership sees Visa also take a minority stake in TrueLayer as part of the company\u2019s $35 million Series C funding announced in June.\n\nThe round was led by Tencent and Temasek, with participation from previous investors Northzone and Anthemis, while we now know that Visa was on-board too. TrueLayer has raised $47 million to date.\n\nFrancesco Simoneschi, CEO and co-founder of TrueLayer tells me the Visa partnership will enable the fintech to work with a \u201chuge network\u201d of businesses and banks to help them to develop open banking services and applications that will \u201cprovide tangible benefits\u201d to customers.\n\n\u201cWe want to scale open banking to a level where it manifestly impacts every aspect of financial services for consumers,\u201d he says. \u201c[This] requires large, established players to come on board and work with startups like us. Visa has been one of the most successful \u2018fintech\u2019 companies ever created, [and] we ultimately have a lot to learn from them\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, Simoneschi says the partnership is a key part of TrueLayer\u2019s twin goals of becoming a global platform and growing the open banking economy. The fintech is already open for business in the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain, and recently expanded to Australia. It works with companies such as Revolut, Zopa, ClearScore, Plum, Emma, CreditLadder, Canopy, and ANNA Money.\n\n\u201cOur view is that any initiative that enables more businesses to embrace open banking is good for everybody involved \u2014 from fintechs to consumers,\u201d says the TrueLayer CEO.\n\nVisa\u2019s SVP of Open Banking, Mark Nelsen, says that working with TrueLayer will enable Visa with to explore new opportunities for its clients and for the Visa network. \u201cOur partnership with TrueLayer is another example of how we\u2019re investing in companies that offer next generation services, enabling innovation and convenience for clients and consumers alike,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to speak for Visa, but I believe that TrueLayer has a combination of factors that are appealing,\u201d says Simoneschi. \u201cWe were one of the first movers in the U.K. for open banking which enabled us to develop our solution in line with the needs of our clients and subsequently quickly grow our customer base. We now are responsible for about 65% of all open banking traffic in the U.K. This gave us the launchpad to scale across Europe \u2014 and most recently to become the first European open banking specialist to launch in Australia. Throughout this process, we\u2019ve developed a reputation for working in partnership with businesses of every size, from banks down to early-stage startups. It really is these partnerships, aligned with our experience, that I think makes us different\u201d.\n\nWith that said, Simoneschi stresses that he doesn\u2019t see the industry as a \u201czero sum game\u201d and that there is a huge opportunity for scores of businesses to do well. \u201cIf we can collaborate to get more people to embrace open banking, everyone wins,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is perhaps this mentality that was an important factor for Visa.\u201d", "description": "TrueLayer, the London startup that\u2019s built a developer API platform for fintechs and other adjacent companies to utilise open banking, has agreed a strategic and commercial relationship with Visa.
