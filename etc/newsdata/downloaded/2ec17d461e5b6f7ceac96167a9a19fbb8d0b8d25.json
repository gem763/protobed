The incident, which occurred last Friday, made Rivest visibly uncomfortable, but she continued to press on through the story.\n\n\"O-o-o-kay,\" she said while pulling away from the man. \"OK, that was not appropriate. Let's just go to the story.\"\n\nThe reporter tweeted about the encounter after the broadcast, sharing a clip of her story along with some words for the stranger.\n\n\"Hey mister, here\u2019s your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!!\" her tweet said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHey mister, here\u2019s your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!! pic.twitter.com/5O44fu4i7y \u2014 Sara Rivest (@SRivestWAVE3) September 20, 2019\n\nThe man, now identified as Eric Goodman, was located by police and charged with harassment. Rivest shared the news on her Twitter account Tuesday, adding that Goodman had written her an apology letter.\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Goodman has been identified as the guy who pretended to spank me and kiss me during the live shot Friday. He\u2019s charged with harassment with physical contact. He has written me an apology letter, I\u2019ll read that on @wave3news later today. pic.twitter.com/chgG9tikVp \u2014 Sara Rivest (@SRivestWAVE3) September 26, 2019\n\nRivest read the apology live on air Tuesday, and she's shared her thoughts on the incident throughout the week. On Monday, she discussed the encounter during an on-air chat with another WAVE-TV reporter, Dawne Gee.\n\n\"I was shocked, but my nervous laughter does not equate to approval of his actions,\" Rivest said. \"It was an exertion of power over me, a woman \u2014 trying to do her job \u2014 who couldn\u2019t stop him. This embarrassed me, and it made me feel uncomfortable and powerless.\"\n\nThe reporter went on to say that the man was pretending to smack her butt when he was standing behind her. She told viewers this was a \"violation and all-too-common occurrence\" for women in the media.\n\n\"Journalists in the field, especially women, again just trying to do their jobs, experience harassment like this all of the time, and it is not OK. If you want to act like an idiot behind me in a live shot, that\u2019s your choice,\" Rivest said. \"But when you put your hands on me or anyone else without their approval, that is wrong.\"\n\nIn Goodman's apology, he called his behavior \"inappropriate and rude,\" saying he'd gained a \"new respect\" for the difficulties reporters face in the field. Rivest said she accepted his apology. However, she still felt that he should be charged with harassment.\n\n\"I truly believe he feels bad and is sincere,\" she said. \"Actions, though, have consequences, and from that letter, it seems like he, too, knows that he needs to face those consequences.\"\n\nRivest has received an outpouring of support on social media over the past week, earning hundreds of responses to her tweets about the kiss.\n\n\"So sorry you had to go through this. I hope it sets a precedent that this is not okay in any way, shape, or form. Keep your head up friend!\" one reply said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the very definition of sexual aggression. I\u2019m sorry you experienced this; you didn\u2019t deserve it. It is so important that he be held accountable.\n\n\n\nMEN: THIS IS NOT FUNNY. THIS IS NOT PLAYFUL. THIS IS NOT WELCOMED OR INVITED. THIS IS NOT OK.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bradley Bing (@Yeah_Brad_B) September 26, 2019\n\n\"This is crap you, nor any other reporter should have to deal with. It's awesome they got that clown,\" another said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is crap you, nor any other reporter should have to deal with. It\u2019s awesome they got that clown. \u2014 Jay Scott Smith (@JayScottSmith) September 26, 2019\n\nEven Rivest's father chimed in, sharing his thoughts through a text she shared on-air.\n\n\"If I had been there, I'd have dropped him,\" her dad wrote. \"Tell him I said that. Jerk.
