As we've seen firsthand through the lens of Dorian this month, climate change is only going to worsen the damage as the years progress.\n\nAnd a Wall Street Journal analysis found they are getting costlier and costlier. Harvey, Maria, and Irma in 2017 cost $268 billion combined \u2014 31% of the full cost of all hurricane damage in the US since 1980.\n\nSeptember 10 marked the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs between June and the end of November.\n\nBut hurricanes can be scary for reasons outside of frightening flooding or deafening wind \u2014 their impacts can take a toll on communities for months, if not years. Survivors of hurricanes over the past two years have also struggled from a lack and delay of federal relief funding, scandals getting their electricity back on, and slow initiatives to get back into their homes.\n\nEven if recovery happens \u2014 sometimes another hurricane seems to be lurking around the corner, as Dorian hit a similar track as Florence and other recent hurricanes.\n\nHere's what recovery from five recent hurricanes \u2014 Michael and Florence in 2018, and Maria, Irma, and Harvey in 2017 \u2014 looks like on the ground.\n\nHurricane Michael hit the Florida panhandle in October 2018.

Only four Category 5 hurricanes have hit the mainland US in recorded history.

This month, nearly $3 billion in federal aid is finally available for farmers.
