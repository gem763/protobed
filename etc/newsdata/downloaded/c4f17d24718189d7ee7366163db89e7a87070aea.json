UCITS of course is an Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (ie a fund that invests in things like shares and bonds).\n\nTo help retail investors, the FCA has decided it would be a good idea to create another acronym: 'funds investing in inherently illiquid assets\u2019 (FIIA). The new rules will apply to FIIAs, which are a type of NURS.\n\nGot it?\n\nFIIAs \"will be subject to additional requirements, including increased disclosure of how liquidity is managed, standard risk warnings in financial promotions, enhanced depositary oversight, and a requirement to produce liquidity risk contingency plans.\n\n\"These requirements will not apply where a fund matches the dealing frequency of its shares to the liquidity of its assets.\"", "description": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince has warned the price of oil could spike to \"unimaginably high\" levels unless action is taken against Iran, the kingdom's main enemy.
