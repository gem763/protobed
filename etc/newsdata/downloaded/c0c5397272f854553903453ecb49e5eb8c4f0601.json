The company allegedly would send emails to nonsubscribers stating that another user had expressed interest in them in a bid to make them sign up.\n\n\"The FTC alleges that millions of contacts that generated Match\u2019s 'You caught his eye' notices came from accounts the company had already flagged as likely to be fraudulent,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Many consumers purchased subscriptions because of these deceptive ads, hoping to meet a real user who might be 'the one.'\"\n\n\"According to the FTC\u2019s complaint, consumers came into contact with the scammer if they subscribed before Match completed its fraud review process,\" the FTC statement went on. \"If Match completed its review process and deleted the account as fraudulent before the consumer subscribed, the consumer received a notification that the profile was 'unavailable.' In either event, the consumer was left with a paid subscription to Match.com, as a result of a false advertisement.\"\n\nDallas-based Match Group also owns Tinder, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish and other dating sides.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe company responded to the FTC complaint in a statement to Gizmodo:\n\n\u201cFor nearly 25 years Match has been focused on helping people find love, and fighting the criminals that try to take advantage of users.
