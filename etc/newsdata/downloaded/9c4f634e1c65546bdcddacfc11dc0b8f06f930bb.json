Toilets and laundry machines are still available.\n\nThe city-owned psychiatric hospital in Southeast Washington, which has 273 patients and 700 employees, continues to admit patients. The water problems were first reported by the Washington City Paper.\n\n\u201cBottled water is used for cleaning cooking utensils and the temperature of the dishwashers is hot enough to kill bacteria,\u201d Jones said in a statement. \u201cAs with any water outage, infectious disease control staff are monitoring closely to address any potential infection risks.\u201d\n\nMore than 6,000 cases of the pneumonia-like Legionnaires\u2019 disease were reported in the United States in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said the illness is fatal in about 10 percent of cases when people become sick.\n\n\n\nSt. Elizabeths Hospital. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cLegionella occurs naturally in freshwater environments, like lakes and streams,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cIt can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in human-made building water systems.\u201d\n\n[A new book recounts the history of St. Elizabeths, the District\u2019s mental hospital]\n\nJones said portable showers, bottled water and hand wipes are \u201creadily available and being used by patients and staff to wash their hands.\u201d\n\nAndrea Procaccino, a staff attorney at Disability Rights DC, which advocates for patients at St. Elizabeths, said the lack of potable water is a difficult situation for patients and staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThe staff and patients are very upset. . . . If you\u2019re not able to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom or there\u2019s no running water, it makes it hard to have proper hygiene and sanitation.\u201d\n\nProcaccino said patients are \u201cvery distressed,\u201d especially with cold and flu season approaching. She said staff and patients are also worried because hospital management hasn\u2019t communicated how long it might take to resolve the problem.\n\n\u201cPeople haven\u2019t taken showers in four or five days,\u201d Procaccino said.\n\nSince the bacteria was found, Procaccino said she has contacted hospital management, the D.C. Council and the city health department, but hasn\u2019t gotten responses. Jones said hospital officials are receiving daily updates and don\u2019t know when the water will be safe to drink.\n\nJones said the hospital hasn\u2019t experienced similar water problems in the past, although a broken water main pipe disrupted the flow of water to part of the facility about three years ago.\n\nSt. Elizabeths, the nation\u2019s first federally funded mental hospital, was founded in 1855. Many of its patients are criminal defendants, including those awaiting competency hearings and found not guilty by reason of insanity, including John Hinckley, the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, who was released in 2016.\n\nThe hospital, which has lost part of its campus to the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies in recent years, has a troubled history. Patients sued the facility over conditions in 1974, when it housed more than 3,600 people, in a case that the District settled in 2012.\n\nIn 2006, the Justice Department found conditions at the hospital violated patients\u2019 constitutional rights, and the District entered into a consent decree in 2007. That decree ended in 2014 after the department found conditions had improved.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The bacteria can cause Legionnaires' disease, which can be fatal.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
