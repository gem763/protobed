Even in cities where the water is contaminated with lead, residents have reported that their taps are crystal clear.\n\nBut in Orange County, the water is actually as clean as it looks.\n\nIt wasn't always that way. In his new book, \"Troubled Water,\" activist Seth Siegel explains how Orange County's taps went from having too much saltwater to spouting the purest drinking water in the US.\n\nSaltwater was seeping into Orange County's freshwater supply\n\nOrange County is just 35 miles away from Los Angeles, but it relies on a completely different water system to serve its nearly 3.2 million residents. About a decade ago, that system begin churning out the most pristine water the country has ever seen.\n\nFrom about the 1930s to the 1970s, farmers over-pumped water through Orange County's underground aquifers, the bodies of porous rock that act as a natural filtration system. The process allowed seawater to seep into the county's freshwater supply \u2014 what's known as \"saltwater intrusion\" \u2014 and threatened to expose residents to excess sodium in their taps.\n\nThough scientists are still studying the health effects of too much sodium in drinking water, early research suggests it could lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease.\n\nOrange County prevented this scenario by getting people to drink recycled water instead.\n\nNow, Orange County tap water starts out as sewage\n\nThe Groundwater Replenishment System in Fountain Valley, California, converts Orange County's sewage water into drinking water.

But more than 4 million Americans \u2014 including residents of Dallas, Phoenix, and Atlanta \u2014 now get at least a portion of their drinking water from treated sewage.\n\nRead more: 11 cities with the worst tap water in the US\n\nBut Orange County's process is unique because it filters for inorganic contaminants \u2014 things like pesticides and industrial chemicals that are hard to detect in water, and may still be allowed under federal law.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency currently has drinking water regulations for more than 90 contaminants, but Siegel said more than 100,000 chemicals and pharmaceutical compounds escape regulation.\n\n\"What makes Orange County so special is they say, 'Okay, fine, the federal rules are X. We don't really care. We're going to go so far beyond those rules that we're going to make the purest water flow we can possibly have,'\" he told Business Insider.\n\nWater gets filtered through invisible holes and zapped with UV light\n\nOrange County's filtration process begins like most \"toilet to tap\" systems in the US. Household sewage arrives at local wastewater treatment facilities, where it's filtered by screens. Then friendly bacteria is added to get rid of lingering organic material (aka human waste).\n\nMost communities allow this treated water to be discharged into public waterways, but Orange County's process doesn't stop there.\n\nNext, the water heads to the Groundwater Replenishment System, where it passes through another set of filters with holes so tiny that they're invisible to the human eye. Mike Wehner, the assistant general manager at the Orange County Water District, told Siegel that the holes are 150 times smaller than the width of a human hair.\n\nOrange County's underground filtration system removes particles, bacteria, and viruses from pre-treated sewage water, and pumps them through stainless steel pipes.

So the county adds crushed limestone back into the water supply to neutralize the pH. From there, it disinfects the water by zapping it with ultraviolet light. This ensures that not a single molecule of waste can survive.\n\n\"It's not fair to say that a contaminant could never possibly be in Orange County's water,\" Siegel said. But the community's taps, he added, are \"as pure as pure can be.\"\n\nThe process could be replicated all over the country\n\nOrange County's \"toilet to tap\" system was expensive \u2014 around $480 million to get off the ground. But Siegel makes the argument in his book that almost any city can replicate the process for cheaper.\n\nWater from the Groundwater Replenishment System in Fountain Valley, California.

The majority of these fees, he said, go toward the municipal budget.\n\n\"Flint actually had the highest water fees in the United States when the crisis broke,\" Siegel said. \"What they did wrong was they diverted money from water fees to the general budget.\"\n\nBased on his conversation with Wehner, Siegel estimates that having water as pure as Orange County's would cost communities an extra $33 per person per year. (That's after replaying any loans used to build the system, and not including state and federal subsidies.)\n\nAs filtration technologies become more advanced, he said, that cost could drop even lower.\n\n\"Now that Orange County has led the way and spent fortunes of money to figure it out, everybody can adopt more or less the Orange County system at not a phenomenal expense,\" Siegel said. \"Why isn't everyone doing it? The answer is: because nobody's pushing them to.\"", "description": "Orange County tap water, which is filtered sewage, is \"as clean as water can be,\" Seth Siegel writes in his new book, \"Troubled Water.\" Here's how.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b9d673e07743b5a692212?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
