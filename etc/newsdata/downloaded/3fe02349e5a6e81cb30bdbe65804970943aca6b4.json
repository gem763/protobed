Biden Jr., Mr. Biden\u2019s son and other Trump rivals.\n\nThe pressure was so relentless that Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his closest aides to open a line of communication with Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers. Mr. Giuliani was the loudest voice among those demanding that Ukraine look at Mr. Biden\u2019s dealings with the country when he was vice president at the same time his younger son, Hunter Biden, was doing business there.\n\nOver breakfast in early July at the Trump International Hotel, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s aide asked the State Department\u2019s envoy to Ukraine for help connecting to Mr. Giuliani. Several days later, the aide discussed with Mr. Giuliani by phone the prospective investigations as well as something the Ukrainians wanted: a White House meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump.\n\nBut if Mr. Zelensky\u2019s goal was to reduce the pressure to pursue the investigations and win more support from the White House \u2014 not least for Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia \u2014 he would be disappointed.", "description": "The president and his allies have been pressing Ukraine for months to investigate Joseph R.
