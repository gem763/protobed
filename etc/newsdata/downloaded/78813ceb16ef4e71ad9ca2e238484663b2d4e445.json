REUTERS/Michele Tantussi\n\nSpeaking at an event in Frankfurt, home to the ECB, Merkel said the central bank\u2019s loose monetary policy was perceived differently across the euro zone and that European economies should be moulded to show \u201cmore homogeneous competitiveness\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis political task that we have is, of course, not to overburden monetary policy,\u201d Merkel told the event hosted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nMerkel has resisted calls on her government to draft a fiscal stimulus package to boost growth in Europe\u2019s biggest economy, which is teetering on the brink of a recession.\n\nEarlier this month, the ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory and promised bond purchases with no end date. Its aim was to push borrowing costs even lower, hoping to stimulate the economy nearly a decade after the bloc\u2019s debt crisis.\n\nA third of ECB policymakers at the Sept. 12 meeting opposed resuming asset purchases. They included Sabine Lautenschlaeger, who will resign as a member of the bank\u2019s executive board effect Oct. 31, before the end of her term[nL5N26H3FZ]\n\nThe bigger-than-expected stimulus announcement fueled concern among frugal Germans, who have complained for years that ECB policy is denying them a decent rate of return on their savings.\n\nAfter the policy decision, the German newspaper Bild accused ECB President Mario Draghi of \u201csucking dry\u201d the accounts of Germany\u2019s savers.\n\nNext to a photomontage of Draghi with fangs and dressed as a vampire, Bild\u2019s Sept. 13 headline read: \u201cCount Draghila is sucking our accounts dry ... The horror for German savers goes on and on.\u201d\n\n\u201cNOT WORRIED ABOUT BRITAIN\u201d\n\nTurning to Britain\u2019s planned exit from the EU, Merkel said the European Union should take Brexit as a cue to look at what turned Britons off the project and look at how it can work better.\n\nMerkel has consistently said she regrets Britain\u2019s decision in a June 2016 referendum to leave the EU, but that she wants an orderly Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe are being challenged by Britain\u2019s departure to reflect from our side: where can the entity, which I fully stand behind, function better,\u201d Merkel said.\n\nShe again stressed that she regretted Brexit but said that Britain would find its way forward.\n\n\u201cI am not worried about Britain at all,\u201d she said.", "description": "Euro zone governments must reform their economies and use appropriate fiscal policies to ensure that the European Central Bank is not overburdened, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434173003&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P11D", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
