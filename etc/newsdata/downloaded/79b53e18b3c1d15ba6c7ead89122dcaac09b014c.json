But it was brought back to life last month by American heiress Michele Ballarin, who announced plans for an October relaunch using two aircraft based in Washington DC.\n\nThe launch date has now been pushed back to December, however, and the first services will only carry freight \u2013 so fish, not fliers.\n\nAccording to Icelandic media, Ballarin arrived in the country at the weekend to continue promoting WOW 2.0, but her spokesperson, Gunnar Steinn P\u00e1lsson, said the initial flights \u2013 between Washington DC and Keflavik \u2013 will not carry people. He added that the airline still hopes to eventually offer regular passenger services, as well as new routes from the US to mainland Europe.", "description": "", "authors": ["Oliver Smith", "Digital Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/September/wow-air-plane-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
