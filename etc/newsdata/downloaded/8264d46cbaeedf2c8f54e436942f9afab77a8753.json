He went to take a closer look and found a tiny black fish \u2013 underneath was Dan\u2019s ring.\n\nJust 24 hours after losing the ring, Dan was brought back together with it. He says there\u2019s no way he would have found it without a \u2018miraculous intervention\u2019.\n\nDan had gone for his regular swim of Battery Rocks behind Jubilee Pool in Penzance, Cornwall, on Saturday morning.\n\nHe usually takes the ring off before heading into the sea, but this time around he forgot.\n\nDan\u2019s wedding ring, made by Oona (Picture: SWNS)\n\nThe seas were rough and the tide was high but Dan swam for about 400 metres. It was only when he came out of the sea that he realised his ring was gone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I put a post on Facebook asking for people to get in touch if they found it snorkeling or spear fishing but really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see it again,\u2019 said Dan. \u2018I was gutted.\n\n\u2018Oona had handmade it. We\u2019ve been married 13 years. When I told her I\u2019d lost it she was upset too.\u2019\n\nDan didn\u2019t have much hope of seeing the ring again until Gary and Emma Spires got in touch.\n\nDan explained: \u2018They heard it first then saw it flapping around on the surface of the pool.\n\nDan and Oona with Gary and Emma, who found the lost wedding ring (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018Gary said he knelt down and the ring was just nestled under the water beneath a little ledge. He might not have seen it had it not been for that little fish.\u2019\n\nGary posted the details of the ring on a lost and found page online, where friends of Dan and Oona connected the dots.\n\nGary, Emma, Dan and Oona have all met for a photo to celebrate the reunion and show off the ring.\n\n\u2018To find it in these circumstances is amazing,\u2019 Dan said. \u2018Thanks to the people who shared my post on Facebook, thanks to Gary and Emma.\n\n\u2018And thanks, little fish.\u2019\n\nMORE: Here comes the bride, in a giant inflatable balloon during extravagant wedding\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Son sends mum wedding anniversary card from her husband who died 14 years ago\n\nMORE: Having a degree won\u2019t get you the salary it once did\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "When Dan Levine noticed his ring had slipped off his finger while swimming, he never expected to see it again.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91128870_1571729474.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
