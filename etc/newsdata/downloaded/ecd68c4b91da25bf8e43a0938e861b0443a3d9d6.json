Ito has said he was deeply sorry for \u201cbringing such a person into our network,\u201d while also disclosing that he had accepted $1.2 million from Epstein for personal investments.\n\nIto also stepped down from the board of The New York Times Company on Saturday, according to a spokesperson, who said in a statement that the resignation would be \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\n\nIto\u2019s resignations come a day after the New Yorker revealed that the Media Lab\u2019s financial relationship to Jeffrey Epstein was more deeply entangled than what was previously known or Ito had disclosed to the public.\n\nIn a letter to members of the MIT community that was released to the public Saturday afternoon, university president Rafael Reif confirmed that Ito submitted his resignation, severing all ties with MIT.\n\nReif said he found the new details about Media Lab\u2019s financial ties to Epstein \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and has asked MIT\u2019s general counsel to hire a prominent law firm to help launch an independent investigation.\n\n\u201cBecause the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,\u201d Reif said. \u201cThis morning, I asked MIT\u2019s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process. I expect the firm to conduct this review as swiftly as possible, and to report back to me and to the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation, MIT\u2019s governing board.\u201d\n\nReif reiterated what he has previously said that accepting Epstein\u2019s gifts \u201cinvolved a mistake of judgment\u201d and an internal review of the processes and procedures is continuing.\n\nEpstein had been on a university list of \u201cdisqualified donors\u201d when Ito accepted some of the sex offender\u2019s donations. In one email, according to the New Yorker, Ito wrote of an Epstein gift, \u201cMake sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.\u201d One of his deputies reiterated the sentiment: \u201cJeffrey money, needs to be anonymous. Thanks.\u201d\n\nIn an email from October 2014 obtained by the New Yorker, Ito wrote that Epstein had directed a $2 million donation from billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. Peter Cohen, then a development official at the lab, wrote in a subsequent email, \u201cFor gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey\u2019s name as the impetus for this gift.\u201d\n\nIto told the New York Times that the New Yorker report was \u201cfull of factual errors.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Media Lab co-founder Nicholas Negroponte defended Ito\u2019s decision to take money from Epstein, MIT Technology Review reported he said at an internal meeting that he would accept the funds even now.\n\n\u201cIf you wind back the clock,\u201d he said, even knowing about the allegations against Epstein now, \u201cI would still say, \u2018Take it,\u2019\u201d he said. He repeated, \u201c\u2018Take it.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo Media Lab members have cut ties since August, after the connections to Epstein came to light. Ethan Zuckerman, director of the lab\u2019s Center for Civic Media, resigned in August, and visiting scholar J. Nathan Matias said that he would be ending his affiliation with the lab at the end of this academic year.\n\nMIT isn\u2019t the only university to court Epstein\u2019s wide-ranging donations. Epstein\u2019s shadowy charity, Gratitude America, Ltd., donated $6.5 million to Harvard\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, a check the university kept even after media outlets revealed the money\u2019s origin. Harvard\u2019s prestigious Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 included Epstein among its top donors in 2018.\n\nEpstein, a millionaire and convicted sex offender who killed himself in August inside the federal jail where he was housed while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, socialized with a glittering array of politicians and scientist over the years, often in an effort to launder his own reputation.\n\nAs new allegations against him surfaced in recent months, his associates from those accused of helping him to those who have hobnobbed with him over the years have been caught up in the backlash.\n\nThe fallout from the new allegations includes Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who resigned in the weeks following Esptein\u2019s arrest. Acosta, who was U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was under investigation for similar allegations in the state, has faced scrutiny of his handling of a plea deal, which allowed the financier to go to work while in prison and which many saw as too lenient.", "description": "The move comes a day after the New Yorker revealed that Media Lab\u2019s financial relationship to Jeffrey Epstein was more deeply entangled than previously known.", "authors": ["Anna Kaplan", "Blake Montgomery", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2777,w_4938,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567883633/GettyImages-1052075272_zwmkfa", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
