REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nThe iPhone maker is appealing to Europe\u2019s second highest court to overturn the European Commission\u2019s 2016 ruling that it pay the record sum to Ireland.\n\nIreland, whose economy has benefited from investment by multinational companies attracted by low tax rates, is also challenging the Commission\u2019s decision.\n\nApple also accused the Commission of using its powers to combat state aid \u201cto retrofit changes to national law\u201d, in effect trying to change the international tax system and in the process creating legal uncertainty for businesses.\n\nThe EU executive dismissed the arguments, saying it was not seeking to police international tax laws and accused Ireland of not having done its homework when assessing Apple\u2019s taxes.\n\nApple\u2019s arguments at the General Court, Europe\u2019s second-highest, came after the EU executive in 2016 said the tech giant benefited from illegal state aid due to two Irish tax rulings which artificially reduced its tax burden for over two decades.\n\nThe case could make or break European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s campaign which has also led to action against Starbucks (SBUX.O), Fiat (FCHA.MI), Engie (ENGIE.PA), Amazon (AMZN.O) and others.\n\nApple\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri led a six-strong delegation to the court where a panel of five judges will hear arguments over two days.\n\n\u201cThe Commission contends that essentially all of Apple\u2019s profits from all of its sales outside the Americas must be attributed to two branches in Ireland,\u201d Apple\u2019s lawyer Daniel Beard told the court.\n\nHe said the fact the iPhone, the iPad, the App Store, other Apple products and services and key intellectual property rights were developed in the United States, and not in Ireland, showed the flaws in the Commission\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThe branches\u2019 activities did not involve creating, developing or managing those rights. Based on the facts of this case, the primary line defies reality and common sense,\u201d Beard said.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these two branches in Ireland simply could not be responsible for generating almost all of Apple\u2019s profits outside the Americas.\u201d\n\nBeard dismissed criticism of the 0.005% tax rate paid by Apple\u2019s main Irish unit in 2014, which was cited by the Commission in its decision, saying the regulator was just seeking \u201cheadlines by quoting tiny numbers\u201d.\n\n\u2018PERFECTLY IRRELEVANT\u2019\n\nPaying an average global tax rate of 26%, Apple has said it is the largest taxpayer worldwide and is now paying around 20 billion euros in U.S. taxes on the same profits that the Commission said should have been taxed in Ireland.\n\nIn its current financial quarter, Apple expects revenue of $61-64 billion and a gross margin of 37.5-38.5%.\n\nCommission lawyer Richard Lyal said Apple\u2019s argument that all its intellectual property-related activities take place in the United States was inconsequential.\n\n\u201cTo a large extent that is perfectly correct and perfectly irrelevant,\u201d he said, adding that Ireland was taxing Apple\u2019s Irish subsidiaries, not the group nor Apple Inc.\n\nHe said Ireland had failed to examine the functions performed by Apple\u2019s Irish units, the risks assumed and the assets used by the subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cThey simply accepted an arbitrary method proposed by the Apple Ireland subsidiaries. That in itself gives rise to a presumption of a special deal, exceptionally advantageous treatment. It is clear that the tax authorities made no assessment in 1991.\u201d\n\nHe said the Commission has no hidden agenda.\n\n\u201cWhat is the case not about? Not about the Commission as policeman of international taxation, not about making sure tax is paid somewhere, though that would be a nice idea, not about resolving tax mismatches,\u201d Lyal said.\n\nIreland said it had been the subject of entirely unjustified criticism and that the Apple tax case was due to a mismatch between the Irish and U.S. tax systems.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s decision is fundamentally flawed,\u201d its lawyer Paul Gallagher told the court.\n\nLuxembourg, told by the EU to recover millions of euros in back taxes from Amazon, Engie and Fiat, is backing Ireland. Poland and the EFTA (European Free Trade Aassociation) Surveillance Authority support the Commission.\n\nThe court is expected to rule in the coming months, with the losing party likely to appeal to the EU Court of Justice and a final judgment could take several years.\n\nThe joint Apple cases are T-778/16 Ireland v Commission and T-892/16 Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v Commission.", "description": "The European Union's order to Apple to pay 13 billion euros (\u00a311.3 billion) in back taxes \"defies reality and common sense\", the U.S. firm said as the two sides sparred in a case key to the EU's crackdown on sweetheart deals to multinationals.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430832511&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0XD", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
