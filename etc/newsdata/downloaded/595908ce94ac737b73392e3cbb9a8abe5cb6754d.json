Waiting until their key pool games against Argentina and France to underline their genuine World Cup pedigree is theoretically fine but, as Wales showed against Georgia, it is never too early to catch and pass with precision and give their future opponents something to ponder.\n\nJoe Taufete'e: 'USA have found a way into England's DNA' Read more\n\nA four-day turnaround including a hasty flight south, on the other hand, have allowed precious little time for reflection on the Tonga game and England\u2019s plan for the USA Eagles was preordained a while ago. The objective is simple: get the job done as simply and effectively as possible before moving on to the crunchier fixtures in Tokyo which will determine the final pecking order in Pool C. While they pride themselves on their world-class beef hereabouts, Eddie Jones\u2019s side do not want to make a meal of this particular contest.\n\nIt could well prove more awkward than some are envisaging. In past tournaments it has generally been the lower-ranked nations who have been required to back up within 96 hours of a bruising Test. This time it is the Eagles who have been enjoying the luxury of uninterrupted preparation on the island of Okinawa while England have been playing and shaking out their suitcases. A similar schedule clearly did not help Fiji against Uruguay, mentally or physically. When Gary Gold, the USA head coach, talked up Jones\u2019s squad as having no apparent weaknesses he slyly omitted to mention he and his Eagles have been targeting this game for months.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eddie Jones: \u2018[Kobe] has always been a place where rugby is the predominant sport.\u2019 Photograph: Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images\n\nMuch work has gone in to improving their set-piece and they will be equally keen to test England physically and via their tactical kicking.\n\nGet ahead and there are few more committed sides in terms of putting bodies on the line. England\u2019s challenge \u2013 which partly explains the starting XV Jones has named \u2013 will involve making the most of any ball kicked their way, utilising their pace out wide and retaining possession rather better than they did against the Tongans. \u201cThe one area we really want to impress with is our attack and keeping hold of the ball,\u201d said Joe Launchbury, one of 13 players in the matchday 23 not involved in Sapporo. Over their midweek team lunch largely consisting of the aforementioned Kobe beef, however, it might have been worth someone raising the subject of the 2007 version of this fixture in Lens when England made desperately heavy weather of beating a spirited American side and lost their then\u2011captain, Phil Vickery, for their big pool game against South Africa after he was banned for a trip on the Eagles centre Paul Emerick.\n\nWhy this World Cup is bereft of talented teenagers when once they were legion | Ben Ryan Read more\n\nFor Jones to lose a key player or two to a similarly out-of-the-blue incident or injury would be untimely to say the least. Nor does he want to see those currently not perceived as first-choice starters trying to throw miracle passes or veering \u201coff script\u201d in a bid to further their individual chances of selection against the Pumas. The USA may be ranked 13th in the world, below Georgia, but they could pose their opponents more scoreboard problems than Tonga, ranked 15th, ultimately did in Sunday\u2019s 35-3 contest.\n\nGold also knows this stadium well, having coached the local Kobelco Steelers. Kobe is home to a huge port and is Japan\u2019s leading sake-producing region, a combination which may help to explain why its residents love their rugby so much. For seven years in a row between 1989 and 1995 their team won the Top 14 title, inspired by Japan\u2019s so-called \u201cMr Rugby\u201d, Seiji Hirao, who attended Oxford University, played in three World Cup tournaments and also coached the national side.\n\nHirao died of cancer aged 53 in 2016 but his legacy lives on in Kobe. \u201cIt has always been a place where rugby is the predominant sport, which is not the case in most cities in Japan,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThere are bars around the town which are dedicated to rugby which is unusual here. Most of the fans are rugby fans, not football fans or baseball fans, so it stands out in that way.\u201d\n\nRugby, furthermore, played its part in rebuilding morale following the 1995 Kobe earthquake which killed almost 6,500 people but Jones\u2019s most abiding sporting memory was a match his Japan side played here in the autumn of 2014. \u201cWe had two games against the Maori All Blacks and when we played them here we were beaten by 60 points. We didn\u2019t deliberately go out to get beaten but we deliberately played away from our strengths to send a message to the team about how we were going to play. The next game we played, we got beaten by one point. It reinforced the point we had to play to our strengths.\u201d\n\nJones, apparently, has since attempted something similar as England\u2019s coach, with similar results. \u201cHow did it go? Not well. It doesn\u2019t usually go well when you don\u2019t play to your strengths, but it can be a great education for the team.\u201d Soon enough, though, the time for experimentation and tinkering will be over. With Jack Nowell and Henry Slade seemingly on the mend, competition for places is about to intensify further from next week onwards. This is not the moment for England\u2019s midweekers to take their eyes off the ball.", "description": "Four days after the win over Tonga, Eddie Jones\u2019s side have to contend with a short turnaround and tricky opposition in the rugby-enthusiastic city of Kobe", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/776c79fb627c5002720c10fba13f3247d4aa0ddd/0_299_5134_3080/master/5134.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c7f0004098abda626ee6063568913840", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
