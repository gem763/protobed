Sharing it to his Instagram, he captioned it with, \"Whatever this means.\" He referred to the post which said, \"I'll never stop loving you. Whether you're across the country, across town, or down the hall. I know the feeling was real because I have never felt this pain before and I feel it every day without you.\" Next came \"sorry\" and \"I love you,\" with a heart emoji.\n\nActually, it's quite a sad post, and even sadder that Colt's taken his lost love to special media. But, then David Toborwosky waded in with his thoughts and started teasing about the lost love post. He said to John Yates, \"Mother's Day already? Lol\" Obviously, this was in reference to Colt's Mother Debbie.

Maybe she got used to trolling and teasing, or the \"Pillow Talk\" segments helped her see the funnier side of \"90 Day faince.\" So, no big diatribe from her this time.\n\nMeanwhile, she knows a bit better how to cope with people who criticize and laugh these days.\n\nAfter all, even the famous comedian Amy Schumer came to her defense over the clothes she wore to Colt's wedding.

We heard rumors in the tabloids that Colt filmed a new season of \"90 Day Fiance\" with a Brazillian woman. But, Debbie came back in and gently gave John Yates a bit of a chiding, and ignored Larissa's post.\n\nThis time she asked John \"what's going on?\" Next, Colt's mom said, \"Quick question, do you prefer the hearts or my kissy lips at the end of my comments? I can\u2019t make up my mind.lol.\"\n\nSo yeah it seemed that David Toborowksy, John Yates, Mother Debbie, and Larissa Lima all got a bit of a giggle at the expense of poor Colt and his lost love.
