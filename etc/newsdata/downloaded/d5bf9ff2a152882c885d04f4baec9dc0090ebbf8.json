It\u2019s a beautiful relationship because they\u2019re both so vulnerable \u2013 they have a great dynamic I think.\n\n\u2018They are totally genuine about each other. Because they have been through so much, they have been forced to grow up much quicker than others. I don\u2019t think their relationship is child like at all \u2013 they have a lot of love for each other. They\u2019re a bit of a power couple!\n\n\u2018With any relationship, there is always a risk but as long as they are happy they should go with what they think feels right. There are very few people who are in favour of this wedding but Bernie is one character who wants them both to be happy! However, Karen is the least supportive! We definitely see that in the episodes to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s absolute chaos! It was so great reading the script \u2013 it starts of Tiffany, Keegan, Keanu and Bernie just going to the wedding and when they get there, the entire crowd of the Taylor and Butcher families are just there in this chaos. It was great to film and I can\u2019t wait to watch it!\n\n\u2018It is just so much fun. I love getting every family member into a room together to do scenes like this \u2013 it\u2019s not challenging at all, it\u2019s just a pleasure to work with them all at once.\u2019\n\nAnd if fans have their way, the couple will make it down the aisle and have a happy ending \u2013 as Maisie has admitted to be taken aback by the level of support the relationship has received from viewers, particularly on social media.\n\nShe grinned: \u2018#Tiffgan! The following is huge, it\u2019s so lovely to have so much support from a fanbase. When I first came back, I was still getting to grips with social media. Seeing some Maisie Smith fan accounts was lovely and since the relationship with Keegan started, the support has just doubled. There are so many fans who just love the relationship. I love watching the little videos that fans make about them.\n\n\u2018Zack is great to work with, he\u2019s a brilliant actor and I think our chemistry on and off screen is really nice. We bounce off each other well so I have really enjoyed playing out the scenes we have done with this relationship.\u2019\n\nOf course, viewer attention is nothing new to Maisie, who first appeared on the show as a child. Although she admits that it can be odd seeing videos of her sasstastic six-year-old self telling a young Dotty Cotton that she is \u2018not flippin\u2019 invited\u2019 to a party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe laughed: \u2018It is weird seeing those. Once the episodes aired, it was sort of forgotten. But seeing your six year old self cropping up is just hilarious. Social media is a great way of seeing how massive it is that I have been connected with the show for so long and fans have supported me from day one and are still there now. A lot of the fans have actually made friends with other fans \u2013 it\u2019s great to see friendships blossoming through it.\u2019\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot going on for Tiffany outside of the wedding drama. On potential scraps with Dotty (Milly Zero), she teased: \u2018Who can say \u2013 at the moment, Tiffany doesn\u2019t trust Dotty at all, and never has. I can\u2019t see them becoming friends if I\u2019m honest.\u2019\n\nOn a Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) return, she was much less cryptic! She enthused: \u2018I 100% want Bianca back. I kept in touch with her from the day I left but actually seeing her again was the weirdest thing and being able to have a conversation with her face to face instead of texting. It was so lovely, it all went too quick. It wasn\u2019t enough, I\u2019m going to start a petition for her to come back.\u2019\n\nOne kegacy that Bianca has inadvertently left behind is the sinister Leo, who is targeting Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), believing that she lied about his dead, abuser father Tony King. But Maisie has hinted that he could get his comeuppance once Tiffany works out who he is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe revealed: \u2018She does get involved a lot more. She knows what Whitney has been through over the years. Tiffany is very wary of any boyfriend because she hasn\u2019t had the best luck. Tiff does get involved with that \u2013 if she does find out who Leo really is; watch out!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Wedding chaos!", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tiffany-and-keegan-eastenders_1572281375.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
