Candice Tresch toldthe online publication.\n\nThe renewed focus on civilian casualties comes amid fresh reports out of Afghanistan that a U.S. drone strike inadvertently killed dozens of pine nut farmers last week. And human-rights groups have blasted the Trump administration for selling weapons to Saudi Arabia for use in the nation\u2019s military campaign in Yemen.\n\nJust this week, for example, Amnesty International said that an American-made bomb killed six civilians \u2014 including three children \u2014 during a Yemen air strike carried out by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.\n\n\u201cIt is unfathomable and unconscionable that the USA continues to feed the conveyor belt of arms flowing into Yemen\u2019s devastating conflict,\u201d said Rasha Mohamed, Amnesty International\u2019s lead Yemen researcher.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
