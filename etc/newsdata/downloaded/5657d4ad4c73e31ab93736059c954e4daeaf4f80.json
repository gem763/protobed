Beijing is developing weapons such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers that are helping it expand the range and scope of military operations.\n\nOnce largely confined to operating close to the Chinese coast, Beijing now routinely sends its air and sea patrols near Japan\u2019s western Okinawa islands and into the Western Pacific.\n\nChina has frequently rebuffed concerns about its military spending and intentions, including an increased presence in the disputed South China Sea, and says it only desires peaceful development.\n\nThe Defence White Paper said Chinese patrols in waters and skies near Japanese territory are \u201ca national security concern\u201d.\n\nThe paper downgraded fellow U.S. ally, South Korea, which recently pulled out of an intelligence sharing pact with Japan amid a dispute over their shared wartime history. That could weaken efforts to contain North Korean threats, analysts said.\n\nJapan's flag flutters outside the Great Hall of the People before a welcome ceremony for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Beijing, China October 26, 2018.

The outcrop is known as Dokdo in Seoul and Takeshima in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cOur government strongly protests Japan\u2019s repeated claim. The Japanese government should acknowledge that it is not helpful for bilateral relations,\u201d South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said.", "description": "China's growing military might has replaced North Korean belligerence as the main security threat to Japan, Tokyo's annual defence review indicated on Thursday, despite signs that Pyongyang could have nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.", "authors": ["Tim Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434388455&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q093", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
