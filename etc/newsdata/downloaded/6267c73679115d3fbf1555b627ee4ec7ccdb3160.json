There's eight weeks to go, and he's been in camp for four weeks already,' Hearn told Fino Boxing.\n\n'A lot of early sparring now is replicating the style of Ruiz.\n\n'Last time we had probably three weeks of sparring, and it was tough to find a guy like Ruiz, because there aren't many like him.\n\n'Small, a little bit chubby, fast hands, and really good on the inside. Now we've replicated that, I feel like the preparation is going to be great.'\n\nEddie Hearn believes they've had the right sparring and is confident preparations will be great\n\nRuiz, however, has fired a warning to Joshua that he will be 'lighter, faster and more powerful' for the rematch.\n\nThe unified world champion vowed to whip himself in shape for his first defence of the WBA, WBO and IBF world titles and has shown off his new, leaner physique on social media this week.\n\nDespite dropping Joshua four times on route to a seventh-round stoppage last time around, Ruiz is still considered the underdog for this fight.\n\nBut the Mexican is confident of shocking the world again on December 7.\n\n'They will believe that in December they will win,' he said. 'People will always talk like this, but I have faith that we're going to win and shut up more mouths.'", "description": "Joshua is in the midst of his 12-week training camp and is working towards\u00a0avenging his shock defeat in the money-spinning December 7 rematch with Ruiz Jnr in Saudi Arabia.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/09/19730540-0-image-a-2_1571128460785.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
