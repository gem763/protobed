As a slightly jaded New Yorker, it's hard to comprehend. But as a fellow traveler, I get it: you're drinking in the infectious energy of a place that's entirely new.\n\nThe Conrad New York Downtown is not for that traveler. Rather, it's for the person who's already pushed their way through Times Square, and now wants something more local, refined, and to experience other nooks of New York that are far less-in-your-face.\n\nWedged between trendy TriBeCa and residential Battery Park, the five-star property from Hilton's luxury Conrad portfolio places you smack in the heart of lower Manhattan. The hotel is directly across from both upmarket Brookfield Place shopping and dining, and a lush park facing the Hudson River.\n\nAn all-suite offering, you'll be hard-pressed to find more spacious accommodations in all of Manhattan. Depending on when you visit, the Conrad can cost anywhere from $300 to $600 per night. That's a big gap, but consider whether you're visiting midweek, on a weekend, or during peak holiday season. New York hotels are also notoriously expensive, even when they're not high-end. If you hold a Hilton-branded credit card, you'll not only rack up points with a visit but could potentially redeem a stay as well.\n\nI visited on a Tuesday in October and while my room was comped for review purposes, my research showed a similar week night to fall at that lower end, from $300 to $350. Had I stayed on a weekend, it would have quickly pushed $500.\n\nBut here's the good news \u2014 it's well worth the money.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed with the Conrad New York Downtown.\n\nThe view of the lobby atrium's major art installations upon entering from the west entrance. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\n\nWith its cavernous entrance and exposed guest hallways, the Conrad's lobby atrium somehow feels like both a contemporary art museum and a futuristic spaceship hangar.\n\nConceptual artist Sol LeWitt's 13-story blue and purple painting \"Loopy Doopy\" (also the namesake for the hotel's rooftop bar) makes a strong statement, complemented by Monica Ponce de Leon's \"Veils,\" a dramatic dangling steel installation. The works hint to a larger theme of art \u2014 2,000 pieces are woven throughout 463 guest room, public spaces, and 30,000 square feet of meeting space.\n\nThe lobby art installations especially dramatic at night. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\n\nChecking in was easy, and the staff were welcoming and extremely helpful, quick to point out key hotel features and amenities.\n\nThe bedroom is easily partitioned from both the shower and bath areas, as well as the living room. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\n\nI zipped up 10 floors to my Hudson River View King Suite, which was located right off the main elevator bank \u2014 something I typically try to avoid. Fortunately, all suites feature separate living and sleeping areas, so hallway noise was non-existent in the bedroom, which could be sectioned off by two different partitions. This is a great feature for families or groups.\n\nEntry level offerings at the all-suite Conrad New York in TriBeCa tout 430 square feet, which seems downright palatial compared to many of the trendy micro-room hotels currently commanding New York tourists' attention. Executive and luxury suites with 700 square feet are also available for even more space, with walk-in closets, sleeper sofas, and larger living rooms.\n\nMy room was a slight upgrade in that it offered sweeping views of the Hudson River, right from bed.\n\nThe bed in the aptly named Hudson River View King Suite was incredibly plush and comfy. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\n\nDecor was made up of light wood and sleek stone for a soothing, neutral palette. The living room was functional, with a work desk, espresso machine, and wet bar. My couch showed a bit of wear and tear with some visible stains, but aside from that, the room was immaculate.\n\nThe standout for me was, without doubt, the shower. Separate from the toilet and double sink bathroom, the expansive walk-in rainfall shower nearly doubled as a steam room when in use. I emerged as blissful as if I had slipped away to the spa. Surprisingly, there were no bathrobes. This felt like a missed opportunity on the hotel's part.\n\nThe shower of my dreams. Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\n\nNightly turndown service was a nice perk, which set out plush slippers by my bedside. The king bed was exceedingly soft and comfortable, and a highlight.\n\nWhile the bedroom was private and removed, there was audible noise from outside. River views also came with regular ferry horn blasts, which started fairly early, plus some standard New York City traffic. The latter was significantly less however than other neighborhoods like Midtown. Because I'm a light sleeper, if I found myself at the Conrad again, I would consider foregoing the view for a quieter location, if available.\n\nSavor a prime perch over the Hudson from the 16th floor Loopy Doopy rooftop (named for the signature piece of art in the lobby). Emily Hochberg/Business Insider\n\nAdjacent to the lobby you'll find Atrio, a wine bar and restaurant, and upstairs, the seasonal Loopy Doopy Rooftop. From April to October, Loopy Doopy is absolutely worth a stop for views and cocktails like signature Prosecco boozy ice pops. In-room dining is also available, though it's quite expensive.\n\nThere's no spa, though the hotel can arrange for services, and there is an onsite barbershop and nail salon. The gym was under renovation during my visit but should be open quite soon with all new equipment.\n\nWhat's not? Nearly everything looks and feels brand new in this corner of lower Manhattan, with popular New York City eateries opening outposts in the high-end shopping mall, Brookfield Place. Look for favorites like Parm, Seamore's, Shake Shack, and Le District, which is the French answer to Eataly, as well as trendy food hall, Hudson Eats.\n\nVenture farther and you're steps from the National 9/11 Memorial Museum, Wall Street, and the Financial District. The nearby Fulton Center houses just about every subway line to get anywhere else.\n\nThe Conrad is a Trip Advisor favorite, ranked 27 out of 504 hotels in New York City, with a 4.5 out of 5 rating from over 4,000 glowing reviews. Similarly, it's earned a 9.1 on Booking. You'll have to look hard for negative feedback, which generally echoes my findings of light wear and tear.\n\nWho stays here: Hilton loyalists, corporate business types, families, tourists who don't want to be in or near Times Square, and people with pets \u2014 this property is pup-friendly.\n\nWe like: The spacious, high-end guest rooms with a TriBeCa address.\n\nWe love (don't miss this feature!): The shower. The design was so stunning, with perfect pressure, and felt totally spa-like. If I ever have the chance to design a bathroom in my home, I want it to be just like this.\n\nWe think you should know: The concierge can be a great resource as they hold strong relationships with Brookfield Place. This means they can arrange VIP shopping experiences, on-demand suits and tailoring, and elevated dining experience. Most people don't know about these services. Take them up on it.\n\nWe'd do this differently next time: While TriBeCa and Battery Park are considerably quieter than other areas of New York, they are not without some noise. I'd ask the front desk for a quiet location next time to see if I could do even better.\n\nThe Conrad New York is the kind of place you stay when you want to splurge and spread out downtown with fewer crowds. It's great if you're planning to explore lower Manhattan, or want to mix things up and try TriBeCa, which is a cool neighborhood that locals actually like, too. Best for business travelers, downtown-minded tourists, you should strongly consider this luxury offering the next time you find yourself visiting lower New York, and want to earn Hilton loyalty points too.", "description": "The all-suite Conrad New York Downtown, part of Hilton's luxury portfolio, is a great way to explore New York without stepping foot in Times Square.", "authors": ["Emily Hochberg"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d966524ee40e4029b5b1c36?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
