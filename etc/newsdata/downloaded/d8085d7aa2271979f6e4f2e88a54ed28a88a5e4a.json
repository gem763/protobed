We\u2019d been together for five years and I thought we\u2019d be together for ever.\n\nWe\u2019re both 26, which my parents kept saying was too young to be tied down, although I didn\u2019t agree.\n\nWe were only 21 when we got together and a lot has changed in the past few years. We\u2019ve both grown up \u2013 I\u2019m into my career, while he\u2019s happy to work in a bike shop and cycle or windsurf every weekend.\n\nWe developed different friendship groups and had started to socialise separately and do less and less as a couple.\n\nThe romance had died a bit too after living together for three years, and our sex life was fairly dull.\n\nHowever, I got carried away with the wedding and just carried on with the preparations until I found myself walking down the aisle.\n\nThe honeymoon was OK, but when I got back I just had this sinking feeling, as if I\u2019d done the wrong thing in getting married. Things went back to normal, but I was struggling to find reasons for why we were actually together.\n\nI asked myself if I wanted to have children with my husband and the answer was no. That\u2019s when I decided to end things and move back in with my parents. It\u2019s been five months now and I feel terrible for inviting people to this big wedding, and I\u2019m sick of trying to explain things and justify my decision. My ex won\u2019t even talk to me. How can I feel better?\n\nColeen says\n\nTrust me, you will feel better in time. It\u2019s only been a few months and naturally you\u2019re still thinking about it a lot, as well as having to deal with the horrible practicalities \u2013 moving out, splitting up your stuff and dealing with the legal side of things.\n\nBut please don\u2019t doubt your decision. You trusted your instincts and I think it takes guts to walk away when you did. You could have let things carry on, becoming more and more unhappy, and you might have ended up having a baby, which would have complicated things further. You knew you wanted out and you took action.\n\nOf course it\u2019s sad when any relationship ends, even if you know it\u2019s the right decision. You\u2019ll always get gossipy or judgy people throwing their opinions around, but so what?\n\nYou did the right thing for you and that\u2019s what counts. And although your ex might not see it now, I\u2019m sure in time he\u2019ll realise it was the right decision too. He wouldn\u2019t want to be married to someone who had doubts.\n\nLean on your parents and friends, and let them support you. It\u2019s OK to get things wrong \u2013 the important thing is to learn from these experiences.", "description": "I ignored the signs that we had grown apart, and I almost immediately knew I'd done the wrong thing.
