President Donald Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the newly-elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he asks for a \u201cfavor\u201d on behalf of his re-election campaign, finally nudged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch an official impeachment inquiry she long hoped to avoid. The release of the whistleblower complaint, which detailed the Trump administration\u2019s restriction of access to the call in an attempt to cover-up its contents, only poured gasoline on the White House\u2019s impeachment fire.\n\nSoliciting help from a foreign power against a domestic political opponent would be a grave abuse of power by any politician, but it is a cataclysmic breach of the public trust when the president is the offender. To use $400 million in U.S. military aid to bludgeon a foreign leader into doing political dirty work would be a damning misuse of U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n\nBut underneath the furor underpinning this latest White House controversy, it is worth noting the number of legitimate reasons why U.S. security assistance to Kiev should be re-evaluated\u2014none of which have anything to do with what Trump may or may not have said on the phone. As Cato Institute senior fellow Ted Galen Carpenter said in a recent op-ed, \u201cWashington\u2019s entire Ukraine policy fairly cries out for a comprehensive reassessment.\u201d\n\nWill U.S. Security Aid to Ukraine Really Help?\n\nNo leader in Kiev would turn up their noses at Washington if it offered to sell them Javalin anti-tank rockets. Former President Petro Poroshenko spent years asking Washington for the weapons during the Obama administration before he finally received a batch of the missiles early in Trump\u2019s tenure. For Ukrainian politicians, U.S. security aid was not only about improving its ability to fight Russian-backed separatists on the ground, but a way to nurture and strengthen what Kiev hoped would be a long-term relationship with Washington.\n\nNo amount of weapons deliveries from the United States, however, could compete with the support Russia provides to its own proxies on the other side of the contact line. Because Ukraine is a geopolitical matter of life and death for Moscow, it will always be more willing than Washington to invest and take risks. To the Americans, Ukraine is a European outlier with a lackluster economy and a corrupt political system (something Zelensky is trying to address). To the Russians, Ukraine used to be a crown jewel of the Soviet Union and is now a large neighbor to the west with a significant Russian-speaking population and a shared waterway in the Black Sea. Washington would be able to live just fine with a pro-Russia Ukraine. Moscow, however, would find it hard to stomach a Ukraine drifting into the West\u2019s camp. A few hundred anti-tank missiles and boxes of ammunition stamped with \u201cMade in the USA\u201d won\u2019t make this geopolitical fact any less true.\n\nThe War in the East May Get More Violent\n\nProponents of U.S. military aid to Kiev argue repeatedly that such shipments allow the Ukrainians to better defend themselves in the face of separatists in the east who would otherwise outgun them. Better military capability on Kiev\u2019s side would therefore balance out any advantages the separatists have and make further territorial advances more difficult. But there are very few advances by either side on the ground right now. While sporadic shelling and sniper attacks continue along the entrenched three-hundred-kilometer frontline separating the combatants, the war in the Donbass has been stabilized. Ceasefire violations occur nearly every single day, but the lines are essentially fixed in their current positions. There is a tenuous understanding on both sides that incursions from one will lead to counter-incursions from the other. Tactically speaking, there is no need to balance the conflict because it has been balanced for years.\n\nMore Aid to Kiev Doesn\u2019t Help Diplomacy\n\nFor the first time since Germany and France helped solidify the Minsk agreement in 2016, Kiev and Moscow are tinkering with ending the four-year long war. Zelensky\u2019s winning campaign was focused on freeing Ukrainians from Russian prisons and exploring ways to strike a peace deal as quickly as possible. The mutual withdrawal of personnel from the town of Stanytsia Luhanska in June and the prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia in September have opened up a narrow window of opportunity to rejuvenate the stalemated mechanism otherwise known as the Minsk process. Kiev\u2019s willingness to pursue additional redeployments from the frontline if the separatists respond with redeployments of their own add additional momentum in preparation for a meeting of the Normandy format in France next month.", "description": "Underneath the furor underpinning this latest White House controversy, it is worth noting the number of legitimate reasons why U.S. security assistance to Kiev should be re-evaluated\u2014none of which have anything to do with what Trump may or may not have said on the phone.", "authors": ["Daniel R.
