A master of satire and melodrama, Almod\u00f3var was in the vanguard of Spain\u2019s \u201cMovida Madrile\u00f1a,\u201d a counter-cultural reaction to the death of dictator Francisco Franco. Labyrinth of Passion was Almod\u00f3var\u2019s second movie, an anarchic soap opera about the gay romance between a pop star and a prince. Banderas, who was 19 years old when the film was shot, smolders in the supporting role of a terrorist revolutionary looking to thwart the main pairing.\u201cWe presented a tribe that was way more sweet, more colorful than what the regime permitted,\u201d Banderas recalled of the film\u2019s ensemble in a recent interview with Vulture. \u201cThat went to the mind of young people who wanted to break with the past and propose something new and fresh for the future.\u201d\n\nCinevista / Everett Collection\n\nLaw of Desire (1987)\n\nBanderas frequently collaborated with Almod\u00f3var in the \u201980s, giving terrific supporting turns in films such as Matador and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. One of his most impressive leading roles was in Law of Desire, where he played Antonio, a repressed and closeted man who grows romantically obsessed with a film director. Banderas\u2019s work with Almod\u00f3var often used his looks to disguise the characters\u2019 potential for dark villainy, and Law of Desire works because of its compassion for Antonio even as he starts to spiral. Much like Labyrinth of Passion, the film was greeted with scandal upon release because of its sexual frankness.\n\nMary Evans / Ronald Grant / Everett Collection\n\nTie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1989)\n\nThe last film Banderas made with Almod\u00f3var for more than 20 years, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! grabbed Hollywood\u2019s attention, which is strange to consider given the movie\u2019s shocking content. Once again, Banderas plays a handsome but twisted creature, a psychiatric patient named Ricky who kidnaps and imprisons an actress (Victoria Abril) he\u2019s in love with. It\u2019s one of Almod\u00f3var\u2019s masterpieces, a satire of classic love stories told through the warped perspective of someone who can\u2019t distinguish between reality and fiction. Banderas\u2019s performance, which balances charm and menace, sums up what makes him so hypnotic to watch.\n\nTriStar Pictures / Everett Collection\n\nPhiladelphia (1993)\n\nBanderas\u2019s first English-language film was 1992\u2019s The Mambo Kings, for which he learned and performed his lines phonetically. He was then slotted into several secondary roles that traded on his European mystique before appearing in Jonathan Demme\u2019s Philadelphia. Here, Banderas is the supportive boyfriend of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks), an attorney suing his employer for homophobic discrimination. Compared to the actor\u2019s work with Almod\u00f3var, Philadelphia is a rather delicate and tame effort, featuring only one chaste kiss between Hanks and Banderas, but it was nonetheless a groundbreaking story for mainstream Hollywood.", "description": "From his early films with Pedro Almod\u00f3var to Desperado, Shrek 2, and Spy Kids, the Spanish actor has always been an inventive and daring performer.", "authors": ["David Sims"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/pai_and_glory/facebook.jpg?1569595491", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
