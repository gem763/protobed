Anything you\u2019d like him to hear from you?\n\nHUNTER BIDEN: No, no. It\u2019s really hard for me to say anything snarky right now or combative because I was raised to respect that office. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s making me emotional.\n\nROBACH: Why do you think you\u2019re getting emotional?\n\nBIDEN: Because I am really proud of being an American, but I have to admit, I take no pleasure in this watching this death spiral of this administration, this president and the people that surround him.\n\nROBACH: How do you think this will all play out in the history books?\n\nBIDEN: I don\u2019t know. I hope that the history hasn\u2019t been fully written yet. I hope that a lot of people that have a chance at redemption here stand up for what is right.", "description": "Hunter Biden choked up when he accused Donald Trump and his administration of eroding his respect for the office of U.S. President.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hunter-biden-abc-interview2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
