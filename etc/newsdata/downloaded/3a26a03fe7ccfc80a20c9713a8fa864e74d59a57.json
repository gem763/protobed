To speak on Trump\u2019s behalf on Sunday, all that remained were true believers like Representative Jim Jordan, Rudy Giuliani, and Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson.\n\nIn an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Jordan borrowed Marco Rubio\u2019s dismissal of Trump\u2019s open request for China to investigate the Biden family, claiming that it was not serious \u2014 though one Trump ally did confirm with CNN that he was serious and such an inquiry would be a great way to build goodwill with the president. Jordan also refused to answer whether or not such a request was appropriate, suggesting, perhaps, that a broad-daylight ask for a third country to investigate a political rival may not be ethical behavior.\n\nGiuliani also went a familiar route, bringing out visual aids to bolster his yelling. Two weeks ago, he was reading his texts from an iPad; on Sunday, he printed out papers he said were \u201cthree affidavits from Ukrainian prosecutors,\u201d though NBC News reporter Ben Collins notes that they were just blog print-outs.\n\nGiuliani is reading from a blog called HopelesslyPartisan dot com, claiming to be affidavits.\n\n\n\nPeople think I\u2019m exaggerating when I say they\u2019re trying to prove conspiracy theories from blogs true by repeating them enough. It is actually what The White House\u2019s plan is. https://t.co/6FEkh3DX9M \u2014 Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) October 6, 2019\n\nEasily the strangest Sunday appearance came from Senator Johnson, who dropped into full deep-state conspiracy mode on Meet the Press, talking over host Chuck Todd in a contentious 10-minute interview. After Todd asked about a Friday interview with the Wall Street Journal in which Johnson said the possibility of a Ukraine quid-pro-quo made him \u201cwince,\u201d the senator diverted, hitting one of the president\u2019s favorite diversionary tactics: the relationship between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. (In their affair during the election, the two shared personal messages critical of Trump, which the president has called an act of \u201ctreason.\u201d The texts have become pretext for a right-wing, deep-state conspiracy claiming that the FBI is biased against the president.) As Johnson refused to answer questions on the Trump administration\u2019s activity in Ukraine, Todd eventually pressed him on whether or not he trusted the FBI and CIA at all. The exchange takes place around the seven-minute mark in the video below.\n\nTodd: \u201cDo you not trust the FBI, you don\u2019t trust the CIA, I\u2019m just very confused here.\u201d Johnson: \u201cNo, no I don\u2019t, absolutely not. After Peter Strzok and Lisa Page?\u201d\n\nClearly, Johnson is performing for the president, grabbing at loyalty points as other Republican lawmakers (wisely) choose not to weigh in. But this unsubstantiated anti-intelligence act wasn\u2019t a new routine for him: In the winter of 2018, Johnson determined that there was \u201ccorruption of the highest levels of the FBI\u201d based off Strzok-Page texts involving a \u201csecret society\u201d that actually just had to do with a \u201cVladimir Putin-themed gag gift.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s unlikely that Johnson will express valid reasons to doubt the net benefit of the CIA and FBI, having the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security share his profound doubts in the intelligence community certainly shows how far Trump allies are willing to stoop to wrangle up some presidential favor.", "description": "Senator Ron Johnson\u2019s claim on Meet the Press that he doesn\u2019t trust the FBI or CIA shows how far a Trump ally is willing to go to wrangle up presidential favor, as other Republican lawmakers stay quiet on the Ukraine scandal.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/06/ron_johnson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
