But I know, and I\u2019m confident, the guys will come back to work with the great challenge of being back at home, and see this next test, see if ultimately we can improve from Week 1 to Week 2 to Week 3.\u201d\n\nSmith cited second-half penalties - including a pass interference call - as a reason the team blew a 14-point lead against the Rainbow Warriors for a 31-28 loss.\n\nThe Beavers were criticized for attempting a fake punt on their own 34 with 4:18 to play and the game tied at 28. It went awry, giving Hawaii back the ball and Ryan Meskell went on to break the stalemate with a 28-yard field goal with 2:17 left.\n\n\u201cThought we caught them off guard, we didn\u2019t. There\u2019s risk-reward in this game. There\u2019s no question,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe want to be aggressive.\u201d\n\nSmith praised the defense, which saw Hawaii\u2019s run-and-shoot offense last weekend and will get Cal Poly\u2019s triple option this weekend.\n\nA key for the Beavers going forward is finishing.\n\n\u201cYou look at it, and there\u2019s some progress being made in a tight ballgame and now we\u2019ve got to take that next step and seize that moment and finish on the right side of the scoreboard,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt comes down to trusting your preparation and fundamentals that you\u2019ve been working on all fall camp and it was noticeable that some of that went away in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nThe Mustangs (1-1) are playing the second game of a three-game road trip. Cal Poly won its opener at home against San Diego before falling on the road to Weber State last weekend.\n\nOther things to know:\n\nSCOUTING CAL POLY: Coach Tim Walsh is in his 11th season at Cal Poly, dating back to when the team was part of the Great West Conference. The Mustangs went 5-6 last season after going 1-10 the year before. Cal Poly has just one other meeting against a Pac-12 opponent: a 2015 loss to Arizona State. However, they also played ASU twice before the Sun Devils joined the Pac-12.\n\nIn its last 16 games against FBS-level opponents, Cal Poly has won four times, with the most recent a 24-22 victory over Wyoming in 2012. The Mustangs did not play an FBS team last season, breaking a streak of 13 straight years with one on the schedule.\n\nSUSPENSIONS: Oregon State left guard Gus Lavaka was suspended by Smith for the first half of Saturday\u2019s game after throwing punches at a Hawaii player following the loss last weekend.\n\n\u201cGus made a bad choice in his response, there\u2019s no question,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBelow the standard that we want around here.\u201d\n\nCornerback Kaleb Hayes was also suspended for shoving a teammate in frustration during the game after an unsportsmanlike conduct call.\n\nJOB SECURITY: Smith said the team is staying with sixth-year quarterback Jake Luton as its starter. Luton won the preseason camp competition over Nebraska transfer Tristan Gebbia. Luton completed 15 of 32 passes for 169 yards against Hawaii but the performance was lackluster.\n\n\u201cHe did some good things. There are some plays he\u2019d like back. That\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI do feel like we have two guys who can score some points, but we\u2019re not ready to say Luton isn\u2019t the guy.\u201d\n\nJEFFERSON EMERGES: Jamar Jefferson was slowed by Oklahoma State in the opener but last season\u2019s Pac-12 Freshman of the Year found a groove against Hawaii, rushing for 183 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries. Last season against FCS opponent Southern Utah, Jefferson ran for 238 yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top 25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "While the list of shortcomings that Oregon State needs to address is long, coach Jonathan Smith is still optimistic the Beavers are turning a corner.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anne M.
