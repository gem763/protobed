Mosley closer to return from groin injury", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - The next step in C.J. Mosley\u2019s return will come on the practice field Thursday.\n\nThe Jets are planning to have the star linebacker participate in individual drills this week as he continues to recover from a groin injury that has sidelined him since the season opener. But whether he\u2019ll be healthy enough to play Monday night against New England remains uncertain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful for (Thursday), that he\u2019ll be able to do individual (drills) and just kind of see how it goes,\u201d coach Adam Gase said at the team\u2019s facility in Florham Park, New Jersey. \u201cI think we\u2019re just taking this minute-to-minute.\u201d\n\nMosley was hurt in the third quarter in New York\u2019s 17-16 loss to Buffalo. The veteran linebacker\u2019s injury was worse than initially thought and Mosley has yet to practice since.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we want to make the right decision, whatever we decide to do,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI think this is just going to be more than just me saying, \u2018Hey, it looks good,\u2019 and the trainers. I think this is going to be full organization, C.J. involved, as far as what\u2019s the best thing for him.\u201d\n\nMosley signed a five-year, $85 million deal with the Jets in March after playing his first five NFL seasons in Baltimore. He made an immediate impact for New York with an interception returned for a touchdown and a fumble recovery against the Bills, but was hurt while knocking away a pass in the end zone with 4:04 left in the third quarter.\n\nThe Jets were clearly affected by Mosley\u2019s absence, with the Bills scoring 17 unanswered points without him on the field. Backup Neville Hewitt has done a solid job filling in with 38 total tackles and two sacks, but Mosley adds an experienced leader on defense.\n\n\u201cAs impactful as getting a starting quarterback back,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s that impactful.\u201d\n\nNew York has seen that firsthand as quarterback Sam Darnold returned last Sunday after missing three games while recovering from mononucleosis and led New York to a 24-22 win over Dallas.\n\nThe Jets have their first practice of the week on Thursday with their game against the Patriots on Monday night at home against undefeated New England.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been able to do lot more the last week or so,\u201d Gase said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s why we\u2019re at this point where it looks like we can get him out at practice.\u201d\n\nMosley\u2019s injury is just one of several the Jets are monitoring this week while preparing to face their undefeated AFC East rivals.\n\nLeft tackle Kelvin Beachum is being called \u201cweek to week\u201d by Gase with an ankle injury suffering in the win over Dallas. Brandon Shell, previously the starter at right tackle before being benched in favor of rookie Chuma Edoga, could fill in for Beachum again.\n\nTight end Chris Herndon was activated after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy, but is dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in workouts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be about can we get him in practice? How does he feel at practice? How far can he stretch it?\u201d Gase said. \u201cThe biggest concern that we have is having any kind of setback because he\u2019s a vertical-threat type of player.\u201d\n\nLeft guard Kelechi Osemele has a shoulder injury that caused him to miss the past two games. Gase wouldn\u2019t confirm various published reports that Osemele will have season-ending surgery on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through our process right now,\u201d Gase said.\n\nAlex Lewis has started the past two games in Osemele\u2019s place.\n\nDefensive end Henry Anderson (shoulder) is still sidelined, while Hewitt (stinger), running back Trenton Cannon (ankle) and cornerback Nate Hairston (knee) are considered day to day. Linebacker Albert McClellan is in concussion protocol.\n\nNOTES: Darnold was selected the AFC offensive player of the week after going 23 of 32 for 338 yards and two TDs with an INT against the Cowboys. \u2026 The Jets signed OLB Frankie Luvu to the practice squad after waiving him Monday. The Jets had a vacant spot after Carolina signed WR Greg Dortch to its active roster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The next step in C.J.
