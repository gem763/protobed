He represents more than 60 families whose relatives were killed. On Monday, Boeing began distributing payments of $144,508 to each family who lost a loved one in one of two crashes involving 737s.\n\n\u201cThey say we don't need Boeing\u2019s charity, and to the extent that they need help from Boeing, Boeing\u2019s not giving in on the one thing that most of them are anguishing about right now, and that\u2019s the return of the remains, and the access to the crash site in Ethiopia,\u201d Clifford told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\n\nFamily and friends of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 Boeing plane crash victims hold a protest outside Boeing's annual shareholders meeting at the Field Museum on April 29, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.

Asked whether work at the site has stopped because of the conditions, Clifford said he suspected that could be the case \u2014 though he did not know for certain.\n\nThe road from Adis Araba, Ethiopia, leading to the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 .

They were originally announced in July to address \u201cfamily and community needs\u201d following the two deadly crashes involving the 737 Max. Boeing said $50 million of that would go directly to families, whose relatives were killed by an Ethiopian Airlines crash in March and a Lion Air crash in October 2018.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cTo date, they have not announced any of those protocols, number one. Number two, one plane crashed in the ocean, the other crashed in an obscure farm field in Ethiopia, what communities are [they] even talking about? Finally, to this to this day, they have yet to announce how they intend to give that money away.\u201d\n\nClifford suggests that Boeing instead use the remaining $50 million to partner with the Ethiopian government to develop a memorial and infrastructure so people can access the disaster site.\n\nBoeing is defending a slew of lawsuits stemming from its 737 Max 8 aircraft, involved in both crashes that resulted in the deaths of 346 people.\n\nShortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia on October 29, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 similarly crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on March 10.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
