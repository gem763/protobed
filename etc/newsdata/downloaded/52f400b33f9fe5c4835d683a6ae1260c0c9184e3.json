(The Wunderle Candy Company puts the exact date at 1888, and says an employee named George Renninger came up with the idea.)\n\nWOMAN CANDY-SHAMES HER RICH NEIGHBORS IN FUNNY VIRAL POST\n\nBut Wunderle wasn\u2019t the only company to hop on the candy corn craze. The Goelitz Candy Company \u2014 which later became Jelly Belly \u2014 began producing the treats by the turn of the 20th century, marketing them under the name \u201cChicken Feed,\u201d according to a 2015 report published in National Geographic.\n\nThe name also made more sense to consumers back then, as corn was more known as feed for livestock, as opposed to the sweet corn most Americans are familiar with today.\n\n\u201cChicken Feed,\u201d and the candies that preceded it, weren\u2019t solely intended to capture the Halloween market, either. The sugary treats, which incorporated marshmallow and fondant, were meant to appeal to consumers \u2014 specifically, kids \u2014 for several months throughout the year, according to the National Confectioners Association.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe original process was also very slow \u2014 meaning year-round production wasn\u2019t feasible \u2014 because of how the three-layer design was created. A heated \u201cslurry\u201d of sugar, corn syrup, marshmallow and fondant was poured from buckets, by hand, into corn-starch molds three separate times (to create the colorful layers) and cooled. Machinery would streamline the process over the next several decades.\n\nAnd while it's unclear when exactly the candy was first marketed as \"candy corn,\" evidence from Jelly Belly seems to indicate the concepts overlapped, with a box of Goelitz's candy marketed as \"butter sweet candy corn,\" albeit with a picture of a rooster on the package.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver a century later, candy corn is still going strong, despite evidence that few consider the candy to be their favorite.", "description": "The Goelitz Candy Company \u2014 which later became Jelly Belly \u2014 began producing the treats by the turn of the 20th century under a less-alliterative name.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/fae34fe3-CandyCorn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
