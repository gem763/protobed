After ten years, 385 videos, and over a billion views, YouTube\u2019s biggest beauty star disappeared abruptly in 2015, leaving her Twitter, Instagram, and video channels silent. Phan arguably invented the entire genre of YouTube beauty. If you\u2019ve ever fallen asleep to the calming tones of a beauty tutorial or learned how to contour from a video, it\u2019s because of her. And now she was gone.\n\nThe 9 million people who made up her subscriber base mourned the loss in the digital equivalent of a candlelight vigil. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you since I was 14,\u201d lamented one commenter, \u201cand I really miss you! Feels like you were my best friend and now I have no idea what you\u2019re up to.\u201d More worryingly, Phan also disappeared in real life. Initially, not even colleagues at her two beauty companies, Ipsy and Em Cosmetics, knew where she\u2019d gone. In 2017, she posted a video called \u201cWhy I Left,\u201d reassuring fans that she was thriving offline, but it seemed like her time as an influencer was over.\n\n\u201cWhy I Left,\u201d an 11-minute opus, remains Phan\u2019s biggest video. Published on June 1, 2017, it\u2019s a self-illustrated cartoon film explaining her absence and how her life had changed since she went from working at her mother\u2019s nail salon to the cover of Forbes. In the film, Phan\u2019s mother tells her, \u201cYou\u2019ll be poor if you\u2019re like me. Become successful, like a doctor.\u201d But success didn\u2019t mean that Phan was happy: \u201cOnce, I was a girl with dreams who eventually became a product, selling, smiling, and selling \u2026 Somewhere along the journey I lost myself.\u201d As of this writing, the video has 13 million views. You could say that Phan\u2019s almost as famous for leaving the Internet as she is for making a career on it.\n\nAnd then suddenly, last week, she reappeared. On Tuesday, she posted her third video in two years. It was titled \u201cHello :)\u201d and consisted of approximately 30 seconds of footage of her cat, followed by another three minutes about the making of an ad for Em Cosmetics lip gloss \u2060\u2014 hardly the kind of tutorial fans were used to. Still, soon after it appeared, Phan\u2019s name started trending again on Twitter. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even planning on dropping a new video, but yesterday moon was in Aries and I was feeling spontaneous as hell. Anyways. Hi!\u201d she tweeted.\n\nFor a digitally deceased person, Phan looks very glowy in the flesh. We\u2019re sitting together at a conference room at her PR agency\u2019s office, picking at egg tarts. Her makeup is remarkably minimal \u2060\u2014 no foundation (she hasn\u2019t worn it in two years), two slim lines of eyeliner \u2060\u2014 which surprises me, since I\u2019ve watched her use beauty products to transform herself into Daenerys Targaryen. (Four million other people, by the way, also watched that video.) While many beauty YouTubers narrate their videos with the upspeak tones of your most excitable friend, with lots of \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cOh My Gods,\u201d Phan\u2019s voice still has the same zen, measured tone that gave her videos a knowledgeable-older-sister quality.\n\nOf her recent return to YouTube, she says, \u201cAs a creator, I\u2019m always filming and documenting the world around me. I film a lot of personal vlogs for myself that I never share, but I decided to post this one for fun. After two years of reflecting and recharging, it felt like a good time to create and share again.\u201d\n\nBut she has no interest in going back to the old days. \u201cI missed out on a lot,\u201d Phan says matter-of-factly. She traveled constantly, but doesn\u2019t remember half of it. \u201cI was burnt out. I was just tired. I accomplished everything I could ever want\u2060 \u2014 even more so! I didn\u2019t come onto YouTube to become a star. But I believed I was the shit, when I\u2019m just another drop in the bucket in this existence.\u201d Part of what she\u2019d accomplished was money; in 2018, Ipsy, a beauty subscription service, was valued at $500 million, while her channel earned $60,000 a month at its peak.\n\nChasing after my bliss \u263a\ufe0f https://t.co/zB6kor7b03 \u2014 \u2133 (@MichellePhan) March 25, 2019\n\nIn many ways, Phan was the first to make money as an influencer \u2060\u2014 an economy that NPR estimates will reach $10 billion by 2020. When I call her \u201cthe world\u2019s first influencer,\u201d she doesn\u2019t correct me. \u201cShe was the first to model how this could be an occupation and career,\u201d says Emily Hund, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in the influencer industry and social-media consumer culture (that there is someone at an Ivy League university studying influencing shows how far it has come as a career.) An entire generation of people probably wouldn\u2019t have jobs without Phan. James Charles wouldn\u2019t exist. In 2015, \u201cinfluencer\u201d appeared 55,000 times in search results on LinkedIn. Now, it appears more than 255,000 times.\n\n\u201cI was at the height of the party. And that\u2019s when you want to leave,\u201d Phan says of the digital-influencer space. In her YouTube heyday, beauty vloggers were more creators than influencers, she reminisces. \u201cI remember eight years ago, before L\u2019Oreal bought NYX, they make this jumbo white pencil called Milk pencil. There was a hack discovered on YouTube where you could melt it with a blow dryer to become a primer. That was dope! You don\u2019t see stuff like that as much, because everyone\u2019s being sent PR boxes. It\u2019s not necessarily bad. It is lazier, yes, but in a sense, that journalistic, democratic approach is now missing.\u201d\n\nBut Phan is still interested in beauty. \u201cThe shallow truth is that I still want to look good! I want to age aesthetically. I don\u2019t like using the term \u2018gracefully,\u2019 because what does that even mean? I\u2019ll do treatments to look younger, of course! There are some things you can do stimulate collagen growth, therapies, or certain fillers.\u201d But she\u2019s also exploring her interests in other non-beauty subjects areas like astrology and cryptocurrency.\n\nShe spent all of last year slowly hiring a team for Em, her makeup brand that she bought back from L\u2019Oreal, and her last interview question for prospective hires is their astrology sign. \u201cI wanted a very nice, diverse, astrological place. If I have a team of water signs, it\u2019s going to be too emotional, too volatile. Or if I have too many earth signs, it will be too grounded. If I have too many fire signs, it will be too volatile, everyone will be competing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an Aries and Sagittarius rising, so I need spontaneity or else I just become really bored,\u201d says Phan. And of all places, she\u2019s found that constant stimulation in the world of bitcoin and blockchains. \u201cI\u2019m actually more excited about Bitcoin than I was when I first discovered YouTube.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, Phan has become a bitcoin evangelist and been buying up shares. She\u2019s an investor in Quarters, a cryptocurrency gaming company run by an ambitious 12-year-old who was frustrated when coins he\u2019d earned in a video game went to waste. She\u2019s appeared on podcasts about Bitcoin and even co-hosted one that featured Andrew Yang. She believes that every entrepreneur should invest in Bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most important investment you can ever make in your life,\u201d she says, seriously and without hyperbole.\n\nBut, I say, Bitcoin isn\u2019t easy to exchange for services. I can\u2019t go into a matcha cafe right now and buy a drink with it. \u201cFor now,\u201d she counters. \u201cThat was the same with the internet, too. Remember when there was only internet cafes? And now we have the internet on our phones.\u201d\n\nThe path from beauty to Bitcoin might not seem connected, but there are commonalities. \u201cI am a lover of decentralization,\u201d Phan says. \u201cYouTube is decentralized, in the sense that anyone can have a channel, have their own network, and make their own content.\u201d In the same way, Bitcoin isn\u2019t truly owned by anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s not run by any higher authority power. It\u2019s not a company. There are no board members. For the first time in history, you can be your own bank. We\u2019ve never had that before.\u201d\n\n10 years ago, I was ridiculed for quitting my job to pursue my YouTube channel. No one saw the potential in the platform like I did.\n\n\n\nYears later, I was ridiculed again for investing in BTC and ETH.\n\n\n\nI like having the last laugh \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 \u2133 (@MichellePhan) August 19, 2018\n\nAlthough Phan isn\u2019t planning on resuming her vlogger career, she still possesses an innate urge to share. When she was a young girl, she dreamed of saving the world. When she was a vlogger, she dreamed of making enough so that her mother could retire. (She did.) Now that she\u2019s here, in this place, she tells me, \u201cI realize I can\u2019t save the world. But I can save myself, and when I show people how I saved myself, and I share how I did it, that can save them, too.\u201d This is an optimist\u2019s view of influencing: helping others by posting about yourself.\n\nI ask Phan how she saved herself, what that actually looks like. \u201cIt\u2019s all about applying little tips into people\u2019s lives. Everyone\u2019s been making this moon tea I showed on my Instagram. People are responding to it like, \u2018It\u2019s the most comforting tea! I\u2019ve never liked Earl Grey tea but you changed my life!\u2019 And to me it\u2019s just my favorite tea, but that\u2019s the beautiful thing about the Internet. You can share things, and those things can really change someone\u2019s life. I miss that.\u201d\n\nCan a tea really make a difference in someone\u2019s life, though? Later, I go on Phan\u2019s Instagram to look up the recipe (which she\u2019d saved as a highlight, along with two other ones about bitcoin). Done her way, the tea bag is steeped in about a quarter cup of milk before you add water and a sweetener of your choosing. This method warms the milk up, making the tea smoother, more blended, and free of that occasionally bitter taste associated with bergamot. I\u2019m not sure it saved me, but it\u2019s definitely better.", "description": "Michelle Phan arguably invented the concept of a YouTube beauty star. But then she abruptly left the platform behind.
