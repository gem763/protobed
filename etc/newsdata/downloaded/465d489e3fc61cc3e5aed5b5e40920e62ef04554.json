If barriers to entry are just a little bit higher for new SMSF entrants, then so be it.\n\nThe SMSF industry won\u2019t like it from a self-interest perspective, but higher barriers to entry don\u2019t affect existing SMSF investors. We would far prefer voluntary ASIC fact sheets now than a massive future regulatory overreaction.\n\nThere are points in ASIC\u2019s fact sheet to take issue with. Let\u2019s call them the bad.\n\nAccording to ASIC, an average investor dedicates less than two hours a week to running their SMSF. I don\u2019t think this is an unreasonable amount of time to spend funding your dream retirement.\n\nOnly ASIC expresses it differently: \u201cIt takes over 100 hours a year to run an SMSF.\u201d It could just as easily have written: \u201cIt takes over 500 hours every five years to run an SMSF.\u201d The bigger the number, the scarier.\n\nRegardless, if you have an SMSF, expect to spend time self-managing it. The clue is in the name.\n\nASIC also states that \u201cthe average cost of running an SMSF is $13,900 a year\". In prior articles, I\u2019ve explained that SMSF averages are incredibly skewed. Because of the fat tail of incredibly large SMSFs, median (middle number) statistics are far more meaningful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, competitive pressures mean you can manage an SMSF for far less than this headline number.\n\nThis brings us to the ugly. Unfortunately ASIC\u2019s fact sheet will reignite the bitter war between industry funds and the SMSF sector as everyone twists and contorts it to further their self interests.\n\nIn the fact sheet, ASIC compares the pair and determines that generally, SMSFs with balances of less than $500,000 have lower returns.\n\nIndustry funds are likely to shout this from the rooftops, ignoring important caveats. But ASIC did include important caveats: \u201cCare must be taken when using SMSF performance figures, particularly when making comparisons. While the methodology used to estimate SMSF performance resembles APRA\u2019s methodology, the data is not the same.\u201d\n\nSo everyone (presumably apart from ASIC) must take care before using ASIC comparisons. The data used by ASIC to compare is not the same; there is just a resemblance. Presumably the way apples and oranges resemble each other as round fruit.\n\nBeyond ASIC and the industry funds, the SMSF industry is not immune to hyperbole and overreaction.\n\nIt will probably create analysis rejecting each assumption and conclusion made by ASIC. I\u2019m not sure how this benefits you, the SMSF investor. We shout our facts at their facts and confusion reigns.\n\nASIC has raised some legitimate issues and they don't deserve to be dismissed as part of a dull, statistics methodology debate. With just under $2.9 trillion held in super (of which SMSFs make up $748 billion), there are good public policy reasons to ensure SMSFs are being used for the right reasons.\n\nBy 2020, I predict industry funds (which now make up $719 billion) will overtake SMSFs as the largest super sector, but ultimately the power lies with you to decide which super structure is the right one for you.\n\nTim Mackay is an independent financial adviser at Quantum Financial.", "description": "Rather than pitting industry funds against DIY options, the regulator's 'nudge' to trustees is a reminder that the power lies with you to decide which structure is the right one for you.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1332%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_107/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0551c1e93dfb28ddec82b7a7e7ae7978154f4c94", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
