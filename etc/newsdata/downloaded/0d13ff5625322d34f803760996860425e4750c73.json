Photo: Apple\n\nOne Saturday evening in 2007, the aged iMac on my desk gave up the ghost. I was trying to get some weekend work done, and the machine was No Longer Having It. Around 11:30 p.m., my soon-to-be-wife said, \u201cYou know, you could just go replace it. The new store is open 24-7.\u201d She meant the flagship Apple Store, unveiled a year earlier on Fifth Avenue near 59th Street. Over the next hour, we warmed up to the hey-why-not oddness of the idea and headed uptown.\n\nDuring the day, that store is bustling if not hectic. At 12:30 a.m., it was quiet, but it was not empty. I remember noticing, then as now, that the staff was diverse, enthusiastic, fiercely trained. Among the few other customers was a foursome in full eveningwear: two men in tuxedos, two women in gowns, straight from a party or perhaps the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nIt was likely the one part of the experience the folks in Cupertino would not have expected, at least not directly. (Whereas, as they did intend, I bought a computer.) What is inarguably true, though, is that the store itself has become a destination, even a landmark, in the past dozen years. Even as we all talk about the end of retail, Apple claims more annual visitors than the Statue of Liberty. (Although to be fair, the store is a little easier to reach.) Its phenomenal drawing power is doubly curious when you remember that Apple has a perfectly nice e-commerce site, where you can absolutely preorder a new iPhone the day before it is released. Why would a person bother to get up early, camp out, line up? A peculiar sense of community, one that is magnified in the center of a city of strangers.\n\nThis week, Deirdre O\u2019Brien, the 30-year Apple employee who is now its senior vice-president of retail and people, laughed when I told her about my unexpectedly dressy late-night shopping experience. She\u2019s audibly giddy about the forthcoming reopening of the store, which has been closed since January 2017 for a big renovation. Version 2.0 opens on Friday, September 20, and this is, apart from a couple of slides that flashed past during Apple\u2019s annual announcements festivities last week, everyone\u2019s first look at it.\n\nThe post-renovation plaza, with new skylights. Photo: Apple\n\nThe original Fifth Avenue Apple Store, designed by the firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in intense (very intense) collaboration with Apple itself, finally dispatched the curse of an awful site. From the time the General Motors Building opened in 1968, the sunken shopping court out front had hosted one flop after another. A couple of restaurants and stores had survived there over the years, but none had thrived. That was because going down the steps into the plaza meant descending from the life of the sidewalk into a dank pit. (A generation earlier, the brand-new Rockefeller Center had this same problem, which was solved by installing an ice rink.) When the real-estate developer Donald Trump \u2014 remember him? \u2014 bought the GM building in the mid-1990s, he made one of the few good urbanist decisions of his life and raised the plaza to grade. In 2003, after he sold the building to Harry Macklowe, Apple began implementing its plans to put a store on top.\n\nIt succeeded in part by turning that plaza into a podium \u2014 in the Greek-temple sense, not the lecturer one. Now, instead of descending, you ascended processionally, as if approaching a marble-columned monument, on your way to the great glass sanctuary of Mac. It almost immediately became a landmark, a highly visible spot where people could agree to meet. Although neither the iPhone nor Instagram existed yet in 2006, Apple had also inadvertently made a stage on which millions of selfie performances could, and would, play out.\n\nFifth Avenue Version 1.0 was, despite its success, an imperfect retail space. The above-ground cube was beautiful, but the there was often a line at the door, because the staircase and the elevator could take only so many people at a time. That was especially true on, say, a holiday-season Saturday, when the store itself reached capacity. Once you made your way in, you were\u2014despite the light coming down through the glass cube\u2014pretty clearly in a subterranean space. Not awful; just kind of basement-like.\n\nThe principal changes, in this renovation, address that dramatically. Most significantly, the floor has been lowered and the roof elevated, adding about 8 feet to the ceiling height. (Most of the clearance was reclaimed from a parking garage below.) The newly raised plaza has been perforated with a grid of round skylights that will bring sunlight down into the store. Eighteen of them, which Apple\u2019s people are calling \u201csky lenses,\u201d have stainless-steel bezels, mirror-finished, and they\u2019re raised above the plaza, sort of like shiny mushrooms. Chris Brathwaite, senior director for Apple retail and design, tells me that they\u2019re meant to foster \u201csitting, selfies, and reflection,\u201d which seems extremely likely to pan out.\n\nThe Cube in its new surroundings. Photo: Apple\n\nOnce you get down into the store, the natural light from those portholes will be augmented with a new LED system overhead, one that will responsively adjust its color temperature over the course of the day, shading toward or away from yellowish or blueish as the sunlight changes, a bit like the \u201cNight Shift\u201d feature native to iPhones and Macbooks. There\u2019s enough light in the basement now that a group of live trees have been planted down there.\n\nThe spaces for activities, Genius consultations, and other such interactions have also been expanded. That, in fact, may be part of the reason Apple Stores remain relevant as most retail shopping collapses. As a consumer purchase, a Mac or an iPhone is more like a car than (say) a pair of khakis, in that you probably need a technician now and then.\n\nOne thing that has not changed, at least in form, is the glass cube itself. It\u2019s famous now, Brathwaite explains, and not something to be messed with. Also, inside Apple, it\u2019s become associated with the memory of Steve Jobs. (Though the cube you\u2019ll see now is in fact a fresh replacement: It had to be demolished and built again to make the reconstruction of the plaza possible.) \u201cThe glass cube stands proudly as a testament to Steve\u2019s brilliance, and our 900 incredible team members are so excited to welcome customers back,\u201d Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, told me by e-mail. It takes a lot of employees to staff the store around the clock.\n\nAlthough the basic form of the store will be familiar, its familiar features have been reimagined as well. The polished stainless-and-glass staircase is bigger now, and a backstage space has been reclaimed for an \u201cexperience room,\u201d where customers can try out HomePods and the like. Altogether, the store is roughly twice as big as it was. On the north and south ends, there are now additional doors at the sidewalk level, which, Brathwaite offers, are intended for the customer who wants to get in and out with a quick purchase, rather than treating the visit as a pilgrimage. \u201cThe entrance for locals, and the entrance for tourists,\u201d he joked to me. All those entrances will once again be open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Selfies on top, all day; operagoers through the side doors, all night.\n\nThe iridescent wrap is only temporary.
