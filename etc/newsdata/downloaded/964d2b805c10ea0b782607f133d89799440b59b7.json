A year ago, Matteo Salvini stood on a stage here in front of throngs of supporters to predict his party would be in power for the next 30 years.\n\nA lot can change in 12 months. When 80,000 supporters gathered here again this month, the tone was different. Salvini is now in opposition, ejected from his offices at Italy\u2019s interior ministry after bringing down the government in a fumbled effort to trigger a new election.\n\nBut not even politics can stop a good party. Over the course of two days, Italians of all stripes \u2014 from middle-aged holidaymakers in campervans to hardcore fans from deep in the south \u2014 turned the valley into a sort of Woodstock.\n\nVendors dished out polenta and gorgonzola, alongside rivers of beer. Tents dotted the hillside, and while supporters occasionally let forth with rote chants \u2014 Elections now! Salvini, premier! Italians first! Freedom from Europe! Stop the migrant invasion! \u2014 the human mass seemed more interested in having a good time.\n\nWith one notable exception: League Youth supporters set up their own stage a few hundred meters from the main event. They had anger in the eyes, and, they said, a determination to keep pushing for Salvini \u2014 and the far-right ideals he champions \u2014 for years, if not decades, into the future.\n\nPhotographers Valentina Piccinni and Jean-Marc Caimi covered the event for POLITICO.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dyp1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
