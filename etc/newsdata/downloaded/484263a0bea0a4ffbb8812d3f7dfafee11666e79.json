And an unhappy Jerry Jones plus cameras and recorders at the ready means quotes are coming.\n\nHolding his breath?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOne target for Jones on Sunday was second-year kicker Brett Maher.\n\nMaher was 1-for-3 on field-goal attempts against the Packers, missing from 54 yards in the second quarter and 33 yards late. The second miss came with 1:44 to play with Dallas down 34-24. Had he made it, the Cowboys could have tried an onside kick in an effort to get the ball and tie the game.\n\nDallas team owner and general manager Jerry Jones has watched the Cowboys lose in back-to-back weeks. (AP)\n\nMaher is 4-for-7 on field goals this season, missing one in Week 3 against Miami. He is 17-for-17 on extra points.\n\n\u201cNot to be holding [your breath] every time he steps up there and tries a kick, we all would like that,\u201d Jones said, underscoring how tenuous a kicker\u2019s job can be. \u201cCertainly, it\u2019s something you think about it when you are trying to win by field goals.\u201d\n\nMaher took full blame for the late miss, saying the snap and hold were fine; he just didn\u2019t do his part and may have \u201cpushed a little bit.\u201d\n\nTurnovers are a problem\n\nThe Cowboys had three turnovers against Green Bay, all on interceptions by Dak Prescott, and had three in last week\u2019s loss to the New Orleans Saints. Those came via a Prescott interception and fumbles by Ezekiel Elliott and Jason Witten.\n\nAsked about what\u2019s ailing the Cowboys, Jones said, \u201cI think that [the biggest concern is] probably our inability to protect the ball. You cannot win if you are one of these teams that for whatever reason turn that ball over.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe have a quarterback that is renowned for his ability to protect the ball, so that ongoing concern is not a challenge that I'm worried about. We'll be able to protect the ball, I feel confident of that. It was also a little surprising to not be able to stop the run better than we did tonight. But let's also give our concern for how we were trying to defend [Aaron] Rodgers, that helped them getting that running game going. He's a tough guy to compete against out here on defense.\u201d\n\nRodgers didn\u2019t light up the scoreboard on Sunday \u2014 he completed 64.7 percent of his passes for 238 yards, with no passing touchdowns and no picks \u2014 but he didn\u2019t have to. Running back Aaron Jones had 182 yards from scrimmage, including 107 yards rushing on 19 carries, and four touchdowns.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got some work to do\u2019\n\nAs they opened 3-0, the Cowboys beat up on the teams they should beat up on: their wins were over the Giants, Washington and the Dolphins. Those teams are a combined 2-12, and both wins belong to New York.\n\nNew Orleans and Green Bay, however, are 8-2.\n\n\u201cI think it tells you right where you are,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou do well against teams that are getting it together and we've played two that have it together better and are 4-1 teams. But the point is that what you see is what you get here. We've got some work to do to get where we want to go this year.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about this thing is: There are 16 games right now. There's 16 games and we're just through a little over a quarter of them and we can get it together and get better. We're going to have to get better to get a change to be where we'd dream to be, and I think expect to be. I think we've got a team that can get better and that's the key, but this is certainly not good enough, last weekend or this weekend.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jones isn't happy after two straight Dallas losses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1zN4M.LLl1SlVKL75psOTQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/umsJcxRXgq3pGONqbkT6PA--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/b1b779c0-e914-11e9-aefb-f0eb4c32fa92", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
