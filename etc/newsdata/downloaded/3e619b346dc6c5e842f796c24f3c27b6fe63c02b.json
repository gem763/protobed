Various devotees visit places of worship with different purposes and God may grant their wishes, respectively. According to the Gita, there are four types of devotees and depending on their motives, they approach God in diverse ways. The first kind is artharti. Such devotees pray for fulfilment of their desires for material wealth and happiness\n\n\n\nThe second classification is that of arta; they pray for liberation from pain and suffering at physical and mental levels. Their devotion to God often results from their pain. The third category is that of jijnasu devotees, knowledge seekers; they want to explore spirituality with pure faith, to know more about God through scriptures and saints. The fourth type of devotees is known as jnani, Self-realised; they have attained knowledge of the soul and are truly praying to become one with the Supreme.\n\n\n\nOne can worship God in any form that one likes.\n\n\n\nWe can pray to our ishta deva, to sakara saguna, God with form, or nirakara nirguna, formless God, but the important thing is our bhava, the right spiritual attitude. While experiencing the unparalleled joy of God, a sincere devotee forgets everything and meditates mindfully on the Supreme. Similarly, meditation is designed to help the mind reflect on the Self through becoming a witness. Meditation is like pouring oil into a pot, it is like the uninterrupted stream of oil that keeps falling into the pot; the goal of meditation is to know the real Self. With the help of meditation, free yourself from the clutches of a wavering mind and be liberated from false ego. Basically, there is no difference between prayer and meditation. The difference exists only if we misunderstand prayer as sthul, gross and meditation as sukshma, subtle.\n\n\n\nDo you have a question for Surakshitji?
