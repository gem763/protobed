I want to go out there and get three points. We need to start winning games, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re playing Liverpool, Manchester City or Brighton.\n\n\u2018A good performance and result can change the players\u2019 and mood and perception of themselves. Maybe they haven\u2019t believed they are good enough and when you lack confidence you think twice instead of acting on instinct. Because I know these players are good enough, no worries about that.\u2019\n\nSolskjaer has become emboldened despite United\u2019s poor run by public backing from the board that his job won\u2019t be in danger even if they lose to their greatest rivals.\n\nThe United manager has become emboldened after backing from Ed Woodward (pictured)\n\nUnited are to welcome back Aaron Wan-Bissaka (left) after his recent injury lay-off\n\nUnited backed their manager\u2019s desire to change the dressing-room culture even though they were unable to sign a replacement for strikers Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez in the last transfer window.\n\nUnited are expected to welcome back Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial from the disappointing defeat at Newcastle before the international break but Paul Pogba is a major doubt with an ankle injury and goalkeeper David de Gea will be replaced by 2014 World Cup finalist Sergio Romero after pulling his hamstring playing for Spain.\n\n\u2018Of course, you first think \u201cOh, David\u201d when he\u2019s sat on floor, but that quickly turns to \u2018Sergio is ready\u201d,\u2019 said Solskjaer.\n\n\u2018Sergio has trained really well and really benefited from the work he\u2019s done. I see a fit and fresh Sergio. He\u2019s already played a couple of times this season and proven he\u2019s ready.\u2019", "description": "JOE BERNSTEIN: Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has cranked up the volume for Sunday's big Premier League clash at Old Trafford.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937268-0-image-a-139_1571519086195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
