In court, Pozner, a retired Minnesota professor, claimed the statements and the harassment he had received because of the book had given him post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAmong them were death threats he received from Lucy Richards, a member of a group that believes Sandy Hook is a hoax used to push support for gun control.\n\nIn a separate case in 2017, Richards admitted to sending Pozner a threatening message that read, \u201cLOOK BEHIND YOU IT IS DEATH.\u201d She was sentenced to five months in prison followed by three years on supervised release.\n\nOn the stand this week, Pozner said his two daughters were with him when the voicemails began playing, and he was concerned for their safety. \u201cIt said a lot of ugly things. And I felt like I needed to defend my son,\u201d he said on the stand.\n\nOn the stand, Pozner testified he had been \u201cdoing well\u201d \u2013 and initially interacting with Sandy Hook deniers to try to defuse the situation.\n\n\u201cI had attempted to be transparent. I published Noah\u2019s death certificate on a social media page I used as a memorial page. And after doing that I was accused of being a fake and a fraud and that changed everything,\u201d he said, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nThe court heard from Dr Roy Lubit, a forensic psychiatrist, who testified that Pozner\u2019s mental state \u201cwent downhill after he was confronted by the denials that it happened\u201d.\n\nFetzer, however, argued that the statements in his book aren\u2019t defamatory \u201cbecause they\u2019re true\u201d and maintained there was no proof that Pozner\u2019s harassers were inspired by the book.\n\nThe jury disagreed, finding three of the book\u2019s statements to be defamatory.\n\nFetzer called the damages amount \u201cabsurd\u201d and said he would appeal.\n\nAfter the verdict, Pozner thanked the jury \u201cfor recognizing the pain and terror that Mr Fetzer has purposefully inflicted on me and on other victims of these horrific mass casualty events, like the Sandy Hook shooting\u201d.\n\nPozner went on say that the case was not about free speech rights.\n\n\u201cMr Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has the right to express his ignorance.\u201d\n\nThe award, he added, \u201cfurther illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror\u201d.", "description": "Father of boy killed in Newtown school shooting sued James Fetzer and Mike Palacek over their book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766f9bdbd81883ba0ab434de17227a41ab5245a8/0_36_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7adf3c15868f41d85cddc9e8bf72e27b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
