Officials later deemed it to have been \"accidental and preventable.\" (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nSantaguida said since the fire, city engineers had to establish whether the heritage building's facade could be preserved.\n\nThen the insurance company only recently released the site to the building owners after a long investigation ruling out other possible causes.\n\nLast week, workers finally began demolishing the interior.\n\nBecause of the heritage designation of the building, Santaguida said it's being done by hand, avoiding heavy machinery to protect the facade of the structure.\n\nDomenic Santaguida hoped to reopen Vittoria Trattoria before his fiftieth birthday in May 2020. Now he wants to have it open again by the end of 2021. (Jean Delisle/CBC)\n\nHe said the recent tour of the inside of the structure itself had been an emotional experience.\n\n\"I was just overwhelmed by how much devastation happened inside,\" said Santaguida, describing damage by not just fire and water, but by firefighters who smashed and hacked at furniture, walls and ceilings to put the blaze out.\n\nThe restaurant \u2014 known for its extensive wine collection \u2014 is not allowed to keep the few bottles not destroyed in the fire, for fear of contamination.\n\nAbout 40 people worked at the restaurant at the time of the fire.\n\nSantaguida said while he was able to secure work for some employees at the family's other two Ottawa restaurants, others chose to look for other jobs.\n\nHe said he believes all the employees found work after the fire.\n\nSantaguida said he hopes the scaffolding in front of the building can be removed soon and open up the sidewalk on William Street. (CBC)\n\nAs for reopening the Byward restaurant, he said the goal is finally in sight.\n\n\"We have a long road ahead of us,\" said Santaguida but he's more optimistic:\n\n\"The last few days I think have been better for me mentally, that we can actually see that there's something happening.\"", "description": "Its owner's hopes to reopen next spring have been dashed by heritage rules, insurance process.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5270945.1567680553!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vittoria-trattoria-being-rebuilt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
