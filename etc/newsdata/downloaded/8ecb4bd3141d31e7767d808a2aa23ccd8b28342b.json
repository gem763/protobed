He was left off the postseason roster three years ago by the Chicago Cubs, the only other team he has been with that made it to the World Series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud for him. I\u2019m anxious to get him in the game. It will probably be one of the first games he\u2019s nervous,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019s hardly ever nervous, but I bet he\u2019ll be a tick nervous just because of the stage and the World Series and the excitement of having to endure all that before he gets to throw his first pitch in the World Series.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old right-hander, whose 782 regular-season appearances are the most for an active pitcher without a World Series game, isn\u2019t the only player for the Astros and Washington Nationals that has waited a long, long time before finally making it this far.\n\nZack Greinke, Houston\u2019s big trade deadline acquisition this season, is scheduled to start Game 3. That will come after 16 seasons and 447 regular-season starts, the most by an active starter without a World Series game.\n\nHowie Kendrick, the 36-year-old who became MVP of the NL Championship Series, is expected to be Washington\u2019s designated hitter in the opener Tuesday night in Houston. He is finally on a World Series team in his eighth postseason appearance over 14 major league seasons, this being his third team to reach the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThis is a dream come true,\u201d said Kendrick, who has 43 postseason games to his credit. \u201cBeen in the playoffs many times, and this is truly special.\u201d\n\nSame goes for first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, the first guy ever drafted by the Nationals in 2005 and the only player to wear their uniform in each of their 15 seasons.\n\n\u201cThis has obviously been an unbelievable ride, and I\u2019m just trying to soak it all in,\u201d the 35-year-old Zimmerman said.\n\nThere also is Game 2 starter Stephen Strasburg, the right-hander who was Washington\u2019s first pick in the 2009 draft, and made his big league debut the next season.\n\nLike Smith, Nationals infielder Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera is in his 13th season with his sixth team before getting to the World Series. Cabrera rejoined Washington in early August after being released by Texas.\n\nFour-time All-Star outfielder Michael Brantley signed a two-year deal with Houston last offseason after 10 seasons in Cleveland. He didn\u2019t get to play in the 2016 World Series with the Indians because of a right shoulder injury that limited him to only 11 games that season.\n\n\u201cThis is not guaranteed to anybody,\u201d Brantley said Monday. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to play in the last one. \u2026 I\u2019m just going to enjoy the experience. I don\u2019t take for granted how hard it is to get here, so I just really want to enjoy the moment and stay in the moment.\u201d\n\nOne of the first people Brantley called after signing with Houston was Smith, his teammate twice in Cleveland - from 2009-13 and after a trade to the back to the Indians midway through the 2017 season\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond happy for him,\u201d said Brantley, one of the first to find out about Smith\u2019s Achilles injury. \u201cI just told him make sure he works hard to get back because I want to play with you again, and he promised he would. \u2026 A big weapon in our bullpen, he\u2019s a great teammate and a great friend for me for a long time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "What a relief for Houston Astros pitcher Joe Smith that manager AJ Hinch was only joking about his team's makeup for the World Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/alds_astros_rays_baseball_60979_c0-194-4655-2909_s1200x700.jpg?3d8ad44f930f24074e8774498bdaaa4dd2b4945b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
