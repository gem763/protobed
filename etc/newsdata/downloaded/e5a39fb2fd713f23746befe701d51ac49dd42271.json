'No one has ever recorded anything like this before.'\n\nThe project was initiated after researchers observed methane levels had been rising across the region.\n\nThe science team posited the methane increases came from the thawing permafrost that has afflicted parts of Siberia as temperatures in the region have climbed.\n\nIn 2017, Russian scientists investigated huge craters in the Arctic regions of Siberia, caused by the formation of enormous methane bubbles under the ground.\n\nThe bubbles would catch fire or explode, creating enormous craters.\n\nA lake in Alberta, Canada was so methane-rich the air above its surface could be ignited, and beneath the gas froze in solid bubbles suspended in water.\n\nResearchers have tied excess methane to climate change, saying that a global increase in temperature of 1\u00b0C would increase methane emissions by 20 per cent.\n\nMore methane in the atmosphere could accelerate climate change as the gas traps 23 percent more heat than carbon dioxide.", "description": "Scientists in the Arctic observed a huge fountain of methane gas coming from the seafloor and causing the sea to appear as if it were boiling, something caused by thawing permafrost.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19502888-0-image-a-6_1570642455215.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
