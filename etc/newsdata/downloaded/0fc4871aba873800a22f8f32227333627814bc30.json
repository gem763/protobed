Coastal and rural areas are suffering the most with elderly and vulnerable patients being forced to travel further for appointments. Research showed 1,946 villages are now at least three miles from their closest GP practice \u2013 162 more than two years ago. Some patients were required to travel up to 14 miles in rural areas. GPs say they are stretched too thinly because of a shortage of 5,000 doctors. They also said that younger medics were less likely to want to work in rural areas. \u2018Rural, coastal and deprived areas always struggle the most to attract GPs, but with a national shortage, they are being hardest hit,\u2019 said Helen Stokes-Lampard, who is chairman of the Royal College of GPs. \u2018They are the canary in the mine for a problem across the country.\u2019 Among the districts hit worst are South Gloucestershire, South Northamptonshire and Cornwall. In the past six years almost two million patients have been affected by 585 surgery closures, according to data analysed by Pulse magazine.\n\nA small amount (10 per cent) of practices took at least a further six more months.\n\nThe move to desogestrel was projected to save the NHS \u00a310million. But because some practices were so slow to implement the change, the health service was exposed to avoidable costs, the researchers note.\n\nFor antibiotics, a quarter of practices did not make their largest change until 29 months after the guidance was released.\n\nTen per cent did not change until at least 32 months after the release, subjecting patients to substandard care.\n\nHowever the academics say the slower implementation could be because the antibiotic guidance was less clear.\n\nThe study, published in the British Medical Journal, is an observational one and can\u2019t establish cause.\n\nBut researchers said better analysis techniques to monitor implementation of the drugs and clearer communication with clinicians could solve the issue.\n\nWriting in the study, the academics said: 'Most practices changed their behaviour but some changed much later than others.\n\n'And some practices showed rapid, coordinated change, while others changed only gradually.\n\n'This heterogeneity [variation] is problematic: it exposes health systems to substantial avoidable costs and exposes patients to suboptimal clinical care.\n\n'Although expecting all practices to respond immediately and adopt optimal prescription behaviour might be unrealistic, the fact that some practices changed both early and rapidly suggests that rapid timely change is possible.'\n\nFurther work is required to explore the reasons for some practices being slow to implement prescribing changes.\n\nThe team added: 'We have previously written on the importance\u2014and comparative neglect\u2014of systems to disseminate knowledge to clinicians and patients, and social structures to audit and assess the implementation of warranted changes in practice.'", "description": "Researchers from\u00a0University of Oxford looked at 8,000 GP surgeries in England.
