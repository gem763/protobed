McQuade in connection with the death of 16-year-old Shelley Connolly, troopers said at a news conference. Genetic DNA testing linked McQuade to the girl\u2019s death, and he was never a suspect before that match.\n\nThe teenager\u2019s body was found in a ditch along the Seward Highway, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Anchorage, by a group of people at a roadside pullout taking photographs of the view.\n\nTroopers Director Col. Barry Wilson said he wanted to offer his condolences to the girl\u2019s family and friends.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how painful it\u2019s been over the years knowing what happened to Shelley and for her case to remain seemingly unnoticed,\u201d Wilson said at a news conference. \u201cWhile I can announce this outcome today, it does not make up for the years of pain they faced.\u201d\n\nThe teen\u2019s mother, Judy Connolly, attended the announcement. Afterward, she said she was flabbergasted when she heard from Alaska State Troopers about the arrest. She noted it had been 41 years since Shelley\u2019s death, which completely altered her family\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never thought I\u2019d see this day in my lifetime,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means a lot.\u201d\n\nThe teen\u2019s stepfather was shown photos of the victim and identified her after hearing media reports of the discovery of an unidentified young woman, according to a trooper affidavit, which was obtained by Anchorage television station KTUU. The stepfather told authorities Shelley had failed to come home the previous night.\n\nAn autopsy found Shelley Connolly was sexually assaulted. She also had multiple injuries, including a lacerated liver caused by blunt force trauma. Past media reports say the girl had been beaten, dragged by a car and thrown down an embankment. Her fingernails were broken, indicating she might have tried to crawl back up the embankment.\n\nThe teen was last seen at an Anchorage nightclub. Witnesses said she was talking to three young men in the bar, according to the affidavit. Authorities pursued leads but failed to identify any of the men.\n\nDecades later, troopers developed a DNA profile from swabs collected from the victim\u2019s body. But they failed to get a match.\n\n\u201cThis guy was never on the radar,\u201d cold-case investigator Randy McPherron said.\n\nEarlier this year, troopers turned to newer genetic DNA analysis, called genetic genealogy testing. The technology involves comparing a DNA profile to the known profiles of people in genealogical databases to find people who share the same genetic information.\n\nTroopers submitted the unknown DNA profile to Parabon Nanolabs, a Virginia-based company that utilizes extracted DNA to perform the genetic genealogy testing. McPherron said McQuade was ultimately identified through one of three brothers.\n\nStandard DNA testing confirmed McQuade matched the DNA profile. The DNA was obtained by Gresham police, who collected two cigarette butts that McQuade discarded in public.\n\nMcQuade lived in Alaska in 1978, according to troopers, who also used genetic genealogy testing to identify a suspect in the 1993 rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman, Sophie Sergie, whose body was found in a dorm bathtub at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Steven Downs of Auburn, Maine, was arrested in February in that case. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOnline Alaska court records don\u2019t list an attorney for McQuade. Troopers said they\u2019re working to bring him to Alaska to face trial.\n\n___\n\nFollow Rachel D\u2019Oro at https://twitter.com/rdoro\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A 62-year-old Oregon man is under arrest in connection with the 1978 rape and death of teenage Anchorage girl, Alaska State Troopers announced Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rachel D'Oro"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/alaska_cold_case_24894_c0-833-2250-2144_s1770x1032.jpg?b95f93ef91d43a770b1a60ae929807dcb5ab7379"}
