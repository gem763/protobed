Organoids are blobs of lab-grown tissue cultivated from human stem cells to resemble tiny organs. Cerebral organoids are designed as simulacra of the brain and are used to study various disorders. Although these mini-brains may only be the size of peanut, they have been observed to develop spontaneous brainwaves, not unlike those that seen in premature babies. Organoids are considered a significant development in neuroscience, as they allow researchers to study brain tissue free of the usual constraints. The line between research on organoids and human experimentation, however, is unclear.\n\nElan Ohayon \u2014 director of the Green Neuroscience Laboratory in San Diego, California \u2014 and colleagues Ann Lam and Paul Tsang argue that checks need to be in place to stop organoids from enduring pain.\n\n'If there\u2019s even a possibility of the organoid being sentient, we could be crossing [a] line,' Dr Ohayon told the Guardian.\n\n'We don\u2019t want people doing research where there is potential for something to suffer.'\n\n'We\u2019re already seeing activity in organoids that is reminiscent of biological activity in developing animals,'\n\nFor example, in 2017, researchers from Harvard demonstrated that brain organoids can develop a wide variety of tissues \u2014 including cerebral cortex neurons to retinal cells.\n\nFurthermore, the team found that organoids grown for eight months developed their own neural networks, which were found not only to be active but also capable of reacting when light was shone upon them.\n\nAnother study \u2014 this one conducted by geneticist Fred Gage and colleagues at San Diego's Salk Institute \u2014 transplanted human brain organoids into mice, finding that they were able to connect to the animal's blood supply and form fresh connections.\n\n'I think it is never too soon to raise issues about ethics in science, so that a thoughtful dialogue can guide scientific research and decisions,' Professor Gage told the Guardian.\n\nSo-called organoids are blobs of lab-grown tissue cultivated from human stem cells to resemble tiny organs \u2014 in this case, the brain\n\nDr Ohayon is campaigning for funding agencies to freeze both any similar studies intending to place human brain organoids into animals \u2014 along with any research that carries a reasonable risk of organoids developing sentience.\n\nLaws already exist to govern research into human tissues.\n\nScientists in the UK, for example, are prohibited from working on donated embryos that are more than 14 days old \u2014 a restriction intended to protect developing humans from suffering.\n\nResearch is needed to determine the point at which sentience is likely to arise, Dr Ohayon said, adding that he has developed computer models that may help do this.\n\nExperts last year writing in the journal Nature called for an ethical debate on human brain organoids.\n\nAccording to Hank Greely, director of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford University in California and one of the authors of the report, organoids were not at a sophisticated enough stage of development to raise real concerns.\n\nHowever, he added, guidelines did need to start being developed for the future.\n\nGreely said there was no single ethical line when it came to organoids.\n\n'I\u2019m confident they don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached a Gregor Samsa state, where a person wakes up and finds he is an organoid,' he said \u2014 making reference to the Franz Kafka novella, The Metamorphosis, in which the Samsa character awakes as a giant insect.\n\n'If they mean the potential to perceive or to react to things, that seems to me likely,' he added.\n\n\u201cThat becomes still more important if we have reason to believe the organoid has an aversive reaction to that stimuli, that it \"feels pain\".'\n\n'I strongly doubt that anyone has reached that point or come close to it,' he said at the time.\n\nDr Ohayon and colleagues presented the full findings of their study at the Neuroscience 2019 meeting which was held in Chicago from October 19\u201323.", "description": "Elan Ohayon - director of the Green Neuroscience Laboratory in San Diego, California - and colleagues\u00a0argue that checks need to be in place to stop organoids from enduring pain.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/13/19990172-0-image-a-44_1571661635649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
