The three of them have split the Rs 6.45 crore prize for their discoveries.\n\nCanadian scientist James Peebles was awarded half of the prize for his theories about the evolution of the universe. The other half meanwhile went to the Swiss duo of astronomers, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz, for their discovery of the first exoplanet beyond our solar system.\n\nJames Peebles, through his work, discovered that a faint microwave radiation permeated the cosmos 400,000 years after the Big Bang. From that, he was able to piece together a large portion of what transpired in the following 13 billion years, laying the foundation for modern cosmology. He was also responsible for developing theoretical tools to calculate the contents of the universe, showing that matter is just 5 percent of it all, while the rest is dark matter and dark energy.\n\nMayor and Queloz meanwhile have been recognised for their joint discovery of Planet 51 Pegasi b in 1995, at least 50 light years away in the constellation of Pegasus. A gaseous ball 150 times larger than the Earth, they also discovered it has a blazing surface temperature of about 1,000 degrees Celsius.\n\nDon't Miss 5.6 K SHARES 1.7 K SHARES 645 SHARES 1.2 K SHARES 810 SHARES\n\nSince their discovery, astronomers have been able to uncover more than 4,000 more exoplanets, in a vast range of sizes, forms, and orbits. Not only have they drastically opened up the possibilities there's another planet out there like Earth, it's also changed our understanding of the possibilities of alien life out there, and what it might look like.\n\n\"The prizes and awards, they are charming, much appreciated, but that's not part of your plans,\" said Peebles as he received his award. \"You should enter science because you are fascinated by it.\"", "description": "Three scientists have just been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize for Physics, for their work in unravelling clues about the beginning of the Universe and how the Earth fits into it all.
