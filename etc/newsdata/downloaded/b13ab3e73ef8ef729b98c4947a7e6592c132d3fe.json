It is difficult to say how long he will be out, I am not a medical specialist,\u201d Deschamps told a press conference.\n\n\u201cAs far as we (France) are concerned, he obviously will not be with us for this camp, nor the next one.\n\n\u201cProcesses will be put in place for his rehabilitation. We are talking several weeks, indeed several months.\n\n\u201cHe will not return to the pitch in 2019, that\u2019s almost certain.\u201d\n\nDeschamps admits France will be missing a \u201cvery important\u201d player but has backed the likes of Alphonse Areola, Steve Mandanda and Mike Maignan to shine in Lloris\u2019 absence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to quantify but he is a very important player \u2013 it\u2019s a loss for us,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBut we have played without him before, even if he has not had a long-term injury like this before in his career.\n\n\u201cOther players will take over to allow the team to continue to perform.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Hugo Lloris is set to be out of action until next year after further tests on a dislocated elbow revealed ligament damage, Tottenham Hotspur announced on Monday.
