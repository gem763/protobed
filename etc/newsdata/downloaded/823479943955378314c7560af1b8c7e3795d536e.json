However, due to health reasons, she hasn't picked up a ball since \u2014 until Tuesday.\n\nXelpho Womack of Lodi, Calif. has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer three times, according to Good Day Sacramento, and was also diagnosed with cellulitis, a common but potentially serious bacterial skin infection. Four years ago, she lost her eyesight.\n\nA year ago, when doctors told Womack she would never walk again, the 75-year-old set out to prove them wrong. On Tuesday, she took her first steps to approach her lane at a bowling alley.\n\n\u201cI was told that I would never walk again and that was the wrong thing to tell me because I was bound and determined,\u201d she told Fox 40. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to walk.\u201d\n\nWomack was able to bowl four 300 games when she was younger. While she may not have rolled a perfect game on her first time back at the alley, she did feel the same thrill she did all those years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so excited. It was so much fun just to release that ball,\u201d she said as she bowled with a group of fellow blind bowlers. \u201cAnd all of a sudden it\u2019s like you\u2019re back 50 years ago. You know, what I used to do.\u201d\n\nWomack credits her ability to walk again to her \"bee positive\" attitude. On the back of her bowling shirt is a bee that matches her two bee tattoos, a significant symbol for Womack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a positive thing, you know? Bees are busy and they\u2019re positive and they\u2019re always working,\u201d Womack told Fox 40. \u201cBe happy. Get busy, you know? Do what you can do and enjoy life because you might not have that much longer. But who cares? Go do what you can do.\u201d\n\nXelpho Womack did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The 75-year-old bowled for the first time in 40 years after being diagnosed with cancer, losing her eyesight and being told she would never walk again.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sEm2gYrvZRQjWXI4ABe0FQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/ktxl_sacramento_834/47cae231e60b9e5a49d17fa8ef56da1c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
