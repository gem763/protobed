Basit also asked for everyone to raise their voice, possibly meaning that people should speak up about the ongoing situation in Kashmir post the Article 370 abrogation.\n\n\n\nBut it looks like this former Pakistani envoy to India was the one with an unclear vision and now every troll on Twitter is raising their voice to take his case. While Basit quickly deleted his tweet when he realised his error, people found out anyway after Pakistani journalist Naila Inayat posted a screenshot that is now being shared everywhere and has got over 10,000 likes.\n\nNow, Twitter trolls are going after him with guns blazing, clearly unable to forgive and forget his Whatsapp uncle-worthy fake news forward.\n\nBut the most savage reply came from none other than adult film actor Sins himself, who mockingly thanked the diplomat for increasing his follower count and declared that his vision was fine.\n\nFollow Shamani Joshi on Instagram.", "description": "Abdul Basit, the former Pakistani envoy to India, thought adult film actor Johnny Sins was a victim of violence in Kashmir and is now being heavily trolled by everyone, including the actor.", "authors": ["Talia Slonim", "Meera Navlakha"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6f892b30aa08000805ed50/lede/1567590823660-Pakistani-diplomat-confuses-porn-star-to-be-Kashmiri-blinded-by-pellets.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*"}
