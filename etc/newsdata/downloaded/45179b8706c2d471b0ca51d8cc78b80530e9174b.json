Biden Jr. during a phone call.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A second intelligence official who was alarmed by President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine is weighing whether to file his own formal whistle-blower complaint and testify to Congress, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nThe official has more direct information about the events than the first whistle-blower, whose complaint that Mr. Trump was using his power to get Ukraine to investigate his political rivals touched off an impeachment inquiry. The second official is among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistle-blower, one of the people said.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, briefed lawmakers privately on Friday about how he substantiated the whistle-blower\u2019s account. It was not clear whether he told lawmakers that the second official was considering filing a complaint.\n\n\n\nA new complaint, particularly from someone closer to the events, would potentially add further credibility to the account of the first whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to the National Security Council at one point. He said that he relied on information from more than a half-dozen American officials to compile his allegations about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to solicit foreign election interference that could benefit him politically.\n\nOther evidence has emerged to back the whistle-blower\u2019s claim. A reconstructed transcript of a July call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky released by the White House also showed Mr. Trump pressuring Ukraine. Mr. Trump appeared to believe that its release would quell the push for impeachment, but it only emboldened House Democrats.\n\nBecause the second official has met with Mr. Atkinson\u2019s office, it was unclear whether he needs to file a complaint to gain the legal protections offered to intelligence community whistle-blowers. Witnesses who speak with inspectors general are protected by federal law that outlaws reprisals against officials who cooperate with an inspector general.\n\nWhistle-blowers have created a new threat for Mr. Trump. Though the White House has stonewalled Democrats in Congress investigating allegations from the special counsel\u2019s report, the president has little similar ability to stymie whistle-blowers from speaking to Congress.\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\nThe Trump administration had blocked Mr. Atkinson from sharing the whistle-blower complaint with lawmakers but later relented.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have taken aim at the credibility of the original whistle-blower by noting that he had secondhand knowledge. The president has also singled out his sources, saying that they were \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person who gave the whistle-blower the information because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump told staff members at the United States Mission to the United Nations. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nMr. Atkinson has identified some indications of \u201carguable political bias\u201d that the whistle-blower had in favor of a rival candidate. But the inspector general said that the existence of that bias did not alter his conclusion that the complaint was credible.\n\nStill, testimony from someone with more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to use American foreign policy for potential political gain would most likely undermine conservatives\u2019 attacks on the C.I.A. officer\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has taken the lead on the investigation into the whistle-blower\u2019s claims as part of the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump abused his powers by using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal interests. Committee aides had sought to interview the whistle-blower last week but have yet to sit down with him, and it was unclear how soon they could.\n\nDemocrats looking to keep up the momentum of their impeachment inquiry are seeing more results than they have in their examination of the findings of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia\u2019s election interference and Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to impede investigators. Though Mr. Mueller laid out stark examples of Mr. Trump trying to interfere with the inquiry, the White House has fought Democrats\u2019 pursuit of eyewitness testimony.\n\nHouse Democrats have moved more quickly in scrutinizing Mr. Trump\u2019s use of power to solicit potential foreign help in his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nLate Thursday, they released explosive texts exchanged by State Department officials and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani about pressuring the Ukrainians to commit to conducting the investigations that could help Mr. Trump politically.\n\nIn one exchange, the Americans sought to have Mr. Zelensky issue a statement promising to investigate a Ukrainian natural gas company where Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., sat on the board.\n\nBut the top American diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., raised concerns about the White House\u2019s decision to freeze $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine, tying it directly to the campaign to pressure the Ukrainians to develop dirt on the president\u2019s political opponents.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Mr. Taylor wrote on Sept. 9 to Kurt D. Volker, the State Department\u2019s former special envoy for Ukraine, and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union.\n\nThe texts show a dispute among the men about whether the president was trying to use the security aid or a White House meeting with Mr. Zelensky as leverage \u2014 a charge at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump has denied that he held up the aid as a quid pro quo. \u201cListen to this: There is no pro quo,\u201d he told reporters on Friday on the South Lawn of the White House in response to questions about the texts.\n\nNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.", "description": "A second intelligence official who was alarmed by President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine is weighing whether to file his own formal whistle-blower complaint and testify to Congress, according to two people briefed on the matter.
