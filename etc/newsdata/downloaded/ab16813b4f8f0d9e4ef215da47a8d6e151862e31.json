With this discovery system there are alternative ways of doing this and developing similar treatments.\u201d\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was earlier in the day given jointly to medics William G. Kaelin, Jr., Peter Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza for their research into how cells respond to levels of oxygen.\n\n___\n\n1:05 p.m.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is celebrating one of its top researchers, Dr. Gregg Semenza, who shares this year\u2019s Nobel Prize for medicine for his work on how genes respond to low levels of oxygen.\n\nSemenza\u2019s dean, Paul B. Rothman, says his \u201cgroundbreaking basic research has been inspired largely by what he has seen in the clinic\u201d at Hopkins. The university says that work has \u201cfar-reaching implications in understanding the impacts of low oxygen levels in blood disorders, blinding eye diseases, cancer, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and other conditions.\u201d\n\nThe 63-year-old Semenza shares the award with William G. Kaelin Jr., professor of medicine at Harvard University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who did his specialist training in internal medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins, and Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe, professor at Oxford University and at the Francis Crick Institute.\n\nJohns Hopkins University President Ronald J. Daniels calls it a momentous day, and says they\u2019re immensely proud of Semenza\u2019s passion for discovery, an example of the school\u2019s commitment to creating new knowledge that helps make a better and more humane world.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nReached at his home in the Boston area, Kaelin said he was half-asleep when his phone rang at 4:50 a.m.\n\n\u201cI was aware as a scientist that if you get a phone call at 5 a.m. with too many digits, it\u2019s sometimes very good news, and my heart started racing. It was all a bit surreal,\u201d he said.\n\nKaelin, who was born in the New York City borough of Queens and grew up in the city\u2019s suburbs, said the prize committee had initially been unable to find his phone number so they first reached his sister, \u201cand that will become part of the family lore.\u201d\n\nKaelin said he isn\u2019t sure yet how he\u2019ll spend the prize money but \u201cobviously I\u2019ll try to put it to some good cause.\u201d\n\nAsked what practical payoffs have been achieved from his work, Kaelin explained that \u201cthe molecular pathway that my fellow prize winners and I helped to define converges on a protein called HIF, and as a result of this work there are now opportunities to either increase or decrease HIF.\u201d\n\nHe said drugs are being developed to do that. Certain diseases like anemia might be treated by increasing HIF, while inhibiting that protein could help with other diseases including certain cancers.\n\n___\n\n12:50 p.m.\n\nDr. Andrew Murray of the University of Cambridge says the three winners of the Nobel prize in medicine \u201crevealed the elegant mechanisms by which our cells sense oxygen levels and respond to fluctuations.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Murray said that hypoxia - when the body doesn\u2019t have enough oxygen - is a characteristic of numerous diseases including heart failure, chronic lung disease and many cancers.\n\nHe said the work of Dr. William G. Kaelin Jr, Dr. Gregg Semenza and Dr. Peter Ratcliffe has \u201cpaved the way to greater understanding of these common, life-threatening conditions and new strategies to treat them.\u201d\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was given jointly to William G. Kaelin Jr, who was born in 1957 in New York City and is a professor of medicine at Harvard University; Peter Ratcliffe, 65, of the University of Oxford; and 63-year-old Gregg L. Semenza at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nThe trio was given the award jointly for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability,\u201d the Nobel Committee announced Monday.\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary of the Nobel Committee at the Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Instititute, said he was able to call the three laureates Monday, adding the last one he called was Kaelin. He reached him via his sister who gave him two phone numbers - the first one was a wrong number but he reached Kaelin on the second.\n\n\u201cHe was really happy,\u201d Perlmann told a news conference.\n\n___\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to scientists William G. Kaelin, Jr, Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza.\n\nThey received the award jointly for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability,\u201d the Nobel Committee announced Monday.\n\nIt is the 110th prize in the category that has been awarded since 1901.\n\nThe Karolinska Institutet said in a statement the trio should share equally the 9 million kronor ($918,000) cash award.\n\nThe discoveries made by the three men \u201chave fundamental importance for physiology and have paved the way for promising new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and many other diseases.\u201d\n\n___\n\n8:30 a.m.\n\nThe winners of this year\u2019s Nobel Prizes are to be announced over the next week, to include two literature laureates and the coveted Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nEvents begin Monday with the award for physiology or medicine. The physics prize is handed out Tuesday and the following day is the chemistry prize.\n\nThis year\u2019s double-header Literature Prizes will be awarded Thursday and the Peace Prize will be announced on Friday.\n\nThe economics prize - officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel - will be awarded on Oct. 14.\n\nThe 2018 literature prize was suspended after a scandal rocked the Swedish Academy. The body plans to award it this year, along with announcing the 2019 laureate.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on the 2019 Nobel Prizes by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/nobel_prizes_99361_c0-233-5568-3479_s1770x1032.jpg?a5a0d838ef6c4cc1ed50475c9b5d454f6fdede4f", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
