Britain was due to make new proposals in an attempt to break the Brexit deadlock, RTE said.\n\nThe main obstacle is around customs, with London proposing that Northern Ireland stays in the UK customs area but that EU tariffs are applied on all goods crossing from mainland Britain to the island.\n\nBusinesses would be eligible for a refund if it turns out their goods stay in Northern Ireland under the plan, which the EU has many doubts about, saying the system is too complicated, untested and not detailed enough at this stage.\n\nThe EU believes the only possible deal to be had at the summit is a return to a solution - already rejected by Britain previously - of keeping Northern Ireland in the bloc's customs union.\n\nIt would require a major shift from London and Mr Johnson will face Britain's parliament at a rare Saturday session after the summit. Parliament, like the country as a whole, is deeply divided over the issue.\n\nLuxembourg's EU minister Jean Asselborn, said that there was some optimism that a deal could be clinched before the end of the day but if that was not possible another summit would be needed before the end of the month.\n\nDeal or no deal, the EU believes another delay to Britain's Oct 31 departure date will be needed. Extension options range from as short as an extra month to half a year or longer. The other EU states would need to agree unanimously to grant it.\n\n\"Time alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it,\" France's European affairs minister, Amelie de Montchalin, said.\n\nSuch a change could involve the prospect of an election or a new referendum, she said.\n\nMr Barnier will again meet national envoys of the 27 EU states staying on together on Wednesday in Brussels.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [LUXEMBOURG] Britain must reach a Brexit agreement with the EU by the end of Tuesday so it can be approved at a leaders' summit this week, the bloc's officials and diplomats said, otherwise Britain's scheduled departure date of Oct 31 could be pushed back. .
