Daily Mail motoring editor Ray Massey got behind the wheel before deliveries arrive in the UK\n\nIt is one of a pair of siblings. The basic underpinnings were developed together in a joint collaboration between Toyota and German car giant BMW.\n\nBut from there the two firms created two very distinctively different cars - with BMW building the open-topped Z4 roadster, while Toyota went for the hard-topped GR Supra coupe.\n\nIt is a far cry from the hybrid Toyota Prius. And in an age of increasingly insipid politically correct motoring it may also potentially be one of the last of a dying breed of cars - that are sporty, fuelled by petrol, and make a proper loud and proud roar when you hit the accelerator.\n\nFans of the 1967 James Bond movie \u2018You Only Live Twice\u2019 may recall the scene where 007, played by Sean Connery, is whisked under fire to safety by a female Japanese agent driving a fetching white open-topped sports car.\n\nThat car was in fact a cannibalised Toyota 2000GT whose roof was cut off specifically for the movie to turn the original low-roofed coupe into a cabriolet, so that tall Mr Connery could be seen on film without being hunched over.\n\nThe cabriolet was never put into production but the two chop-topped cars used in the film are on display in Japan.\n\nBut the 2000GT coupe went on to become a classic. And even a cursory glance at the new GT Supra reveals the degree to which it was inspired by it.\n\nYou need only look at the long bonnet, wide but low stance, and tightly-packed curvaceous but taught and muscular lines \u2013 designed to evoke \u2018the romance of classic sports car styling\u2019 - to see that.\n\nThe Supra name that it bears was made famous through the 1980s and 1990s by Toyota's sports cars that won the hearts of a generation.\n\nGetting in and out of the snug cockpit-like cabin is not easy work and will really exercise those abdominal muscles\n\nThe new GR Supra is powered by a very capable turbo-charged 3.0-litre straight-six-cylinder petrol engine developing 335bhp\n\nLinked to an eight-speed automatic gearbox that enables the rear-wheel drive coupe to sprint enthusiastically from rest to 62mph in just 4.3 seconds up to an electronically limited top speed of 155mph\n\nToyota Supra timeline 1967-1970: Toyota 2000GT coupe \u2013 spiritual sourceof all future Supras (one-off cabriolet version used in 007 movie \u2018You Only Live Twice\u2019 1978-1981: 1st generation Celica Supra \u2018A40/A50\u2019 1981 -1986: 2nd generation Celica Supra \u2018A60\u2019 1986-1993: 3rd generation Supra \u2018A70\u2019 1993-2002: 4th generation Supra \u2018A80\u2019 From 2019: new 5th generation GT Supra launched\n\nBut the Supra has lived more than twice. Depending how you count it, this is either the fifth or sixth incarnation of the spirit of the Supra, whose origins go back to that Toyota 2000GT of the Swinging Sixties.\n\nThe new car marks the return of the Supra name after an absence of 17 years - and around five years of delay and teasing. So what\u2019s it like to drive?\n\nWell from the start I can reveal it really is 'ab fab'.\n\nThat\u2019s because getting in and out of the snug cockpit-like cabin really will exercise those abdominal muscles.\n\nUntil you get used to it, you also risk banging your head getting in and out because of the aerodynamically low roofline. But once inside that is mitigated by the \u2018double bubble\u2019 concave roof space which allows ample headroom for driver and passenger.\n\nThough quite different beasts, the low-slung view from the driving wheel through the letterbox windscreen down the tapering bonnet reminded me of the vista from America\u2019s awesome Dodge Viper muscle car.\n\nStrangely, there is no dividing wall between the back of the cabin and the luggage space in the decent-sized boot behind \u2013 it\u2019s a straight through gap, save for some horizontally set loud-speakers and a fire extinguisher.\n\nBut it has a very good driving position with a steering wheel and pedals that are intuitively positioned with high-backed and supportive sports seats that keep you firmly but comfortably in place during the most enthusiastic driving, thanks also to flexible seat bolsters that can be electronically \u2018tuned\u2019 to your preference.\n\nThe new GR Supra is powered by a very capable turbo-charged 3.0-litre straight-six-cylinder petrol engine developing 335bhp and linked to an eight-speed automatic gearbox that enables the rear-wheel drive coupe to sprint enthusiastically from rest to 62mph in just 4.3 seconds up to an electronically limited top speed of 155mph.\n\nToyota GR Supra: Will it fit in my garage? Price: \u00a354,000 (standard model from \u00a352,695. Launch edition of 25 \u2018A90\u2019 models, sold out: \u00a356,945) First deliveries: September 2019 Seats: 2 Built: Under licence by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria in collaboration with BMW, with sibling Z4 roadster Length: 4,379mm Width: 1,854mm Height: 1,292mm Wheelbase: 2,470mm Gross weight: 1,815kg Engine: 3.0 litre \u2018straight six\u2019 in-line 6-cylinder petrol with single twin scroll turbo. Power: 330bhp (340hp) Top speed: 155mph (electronically limited) 0-62mph: 4.3 seconds Gears: 8-speed auto with manual paddle-shift override Tyres: 19 inch Michelin Pilot Super Sport Fuel consumption: 34.55mpg CO2 emissions: 170g/km\n\nRay Massey pictured with the new Toyota GR Supra during the global launch held in Madrid, Spain\n\nThe cabin might be tight but you soon forgive the lack of space when you start to tackle twisting driving routes\n\nA super low centre of gravity and ultra short wheelbase mean the Supra should be a responsive and well controlled car in the corners\n\nFor added engagement you can use the manual paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nIt claims fuel consumption of 34.5mpg and CO2 emissions of 170g/km \u2013 helped by stop-start technology - though with spirited driving, I do wonder.\n\nIn \u2018comfort\u2019 mode it drives beautifully in a sporty, confident and very well-balanced manner, changing smoothly through the gears and pootling perfectly well around town and through small villages at relatively low speed.\n\nBut press the \u2018Sport\u2019 button and it really comes alive, tightening up the ride and handling and unleashing the full roar of the engine. It feels grippy, stable confidence inspiring and great fun, taking the tightest corners with ease. It's energetic and engaging, but no bucking bronco. This is controlled aggression.\n\nWe also took the Toyota Supra out on track - the very tight and demanding Jarama circuit which was previously used for motorcycle grand prix racing in the 1980s\n\nRay Massey said the Supra is 'formidable' on track but was left wanting for more brake feel, especially when approaching hairpin bends\n\nGunning for the likes of Porsche\u2019s Cayman, the new GR Supra is, like its BMW Z4 cabriolet sibling, built under licence by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria\n\nI also took the new GT Supra onto the former F1 race-track at Jarama \u2013 along with an expert race-driver who knew every blind summit and hairpin bend riding shotgun \u2013 to push it closer to the extreme limit.\n\nIt\u2019s a formidable piece of engineering that delights on the track, though I could have done with some firmer and more planted braking approaching those hairpin bends.\n\nIt will undoubtedly have its own race series \u2013 the prototype race-cars are already being developed. But honestly, I think you\u2019ll have just as much fun and enjoyment out on the road, if not more, as an everyday car that delivers sharp, expressive driving pleasure.\n\nGunning for the likes of Porsche\u2019s Cayman, the new GR Supra is, like its BMW Z4 cabriolet sibling, built under licence by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria.\n\nIt is the product of \u2018a single-minded approach to build a fun to drive sports car\u2019, says Toyota. The \u2018GR\u2019 refers to Toyota\u2019s motorsport arm Gazoo Racing which has overseen the project.\n\nSupra is the 'antithesis' of self-driving electric cars Chief engineer Tetsuya Tada said the new Supra is the \u2018antithesis\u2019 of the industry trend or \u2018revolution\u2019 towards self-driving electric vehicles and the car as \u2018a mode of transport.\u2019 The Supra is about exhilaration and fun. He visited enthusiasts\u2019 clubs around the world to ensure he tapped into all the elements that would make an exciting and exhilarating car \u2013 including a \u2018straight six\u2019 turbo-charged petrol engine with rear-wheel drive. He noted: \u2018Surely acceleration won\u2019t be exhilarating if you disregard the feeling and resonance with the driver\u2019s senses.\u2019 Making the car a two-seater was key to performance success, he said: \u2018Driving quality is 90 per cent dictated by a car\u2019s basic packaging \u2013 the track and wheelbase are particularly important. \u2018In fact it\u2019s the golden ratio between these two dimensions which delivers the best driving quality and I was determined not to sacrifice this. \u2018But the only way to achieve the golden ratio was to make Supra a two-seater. \u2018Even though I was warned that not providing four seats would reduce the number of cars we might sell, I politely but firmly stood my ground. \u2018For me, it was all about delivering a pure sports car with the ultimate driving pleasure.\u2019\n\nAccording to the Japanese brand's engineering and design chiefs, the secret to the new Supra\u2019s success is what they dub \u2013 Harry Potter-like \u2013 the \u2018golden ratio.\u2019\n\nSeal approval from the boss Toyota president Akio Toyota Should you doubt the enthusiasm behind the project, Toyota\u2019s anglophile president Akio Toyota \u2013 who in his younger days qualified as a \u2018master driver\u2019 thrashing an old Supra around the Nurburgring circuit in Germany \u2013 personally signed off the finished new generation car after putting it to the test or himself on the same circuit. He confessed: \u2019Even though Toyota had no plans to make a new Supra, just like a lot of other die-hard Supra fans around the world, I secretly wanted to make it happen.\u2019 And as the boss, he could. \u2018Supra is like an old friend that holds a special place in my heart.\u2019\n\nThat is the near perfect balance between the short wheelbase and the wide track, combined with a low centre of gravity. To achieve this the chief engineer Tetsuya Tada said he \u2018politely but firmly stood my ground\u2019 with bosses to ensure the car was a two-seater.\n\nThis beautifully poised balance \u2013 like an elegant dancer in full flow - is enhanced by 50:50 weight distribution (helped by the engine sitting far back from the front), a highly rigid body which aids responsiveness, specially tuned suspension to aid cornering, and focussed tuning of all components including high performance wide-diameter 19-inch Michelin tyres with broad tread and bespoke wheel hubs which aid stability and manoeuvrability.\n\nThe interior is functional, though the 8.8 inch dashboard screen feels quite small.\n\nThe standard model is priced from \u00a352,695 but nine out of ten UK sales are for the more expensive and highly specced Toyota GR Supra 3.0-litre Pro costing \u00a354,000, which adds electronically adjusted leather sports seats with memory and heating (an upgrade from alcantara cloth), a wireless phone charger, head-up display- which is very useful- and an upgraded JBL 12-speaker audio system.\n\nFirst deliveries are from September but the first year\u2019s UK allocation of 300 cars is already committed and there\u2019s a waiting list for 2020. A special launch edition of 25 A90 models costing \u00a356,945 sold out long ago.\n\nNow where is that old Corgi model of James Bond\u2019s Toyota 2000GT I used to play with as a child \u2013 the one that fired mortars out of the boot?
