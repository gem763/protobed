He called 911 after realizing what happened. Udell was transported to a hospital but died the next day.\n\nPolice arrested Lachazo soon after he fled the scene in the delivery van. He was charged with first-degree murder on August 29 and was still awaiting his arraignment as of Sunday.\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed Thursday by Udell\u2019s family, Best Buy is legally responsible for the woman\u2019s wrongful death because the company did not properly investigate and oversee the delivery drivers.\n\nUdell believed she hired Best Buy employees, subject to the company\u2019s oversight, to deliver her new washer and dryer and remove the old ones, the lawsuit alleges. But Best Buy hired transport company J.B. Hunt to handle the delivery, which then contracted X.M. Delivery Service, which then assigned Lachazo and Gonzalez to the task.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary that the place where we should be the safest \u2015 our own home \u2015 is unfortunately a place of danger,\u201d Nick Panagakis, the Udell family\u2019s attorney, told HuffPost.\n\nPanagakis accused Best Buy of acting with \u201creckless disregard\u201d and said companies failing to properly vet and take accountability for delivery people and other in-home service workers is a \u201cnational epidemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been going on for years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either have to be operating with blinders on or you just know it and don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nUdell\u2019s husband, Joel, has suffered from \u201cmental anguish and emotional distress,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which was filed in the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. The family is seeking compensatory damages in excess of $15,000.\n\nThey are also calling for legislation that requires extensive and ongoing background checks for in-home service workers and ensures companies continuously monitor workers for criminal activity as long as they are hired, Udell\u2019s family said during a press conference.\n\nCourtesy of the Udell family Joel Udell (left) has suffered \"mental anguish and emotional distress\" since his wife Evelyn (right) was killed by a delivery man last month, according to a lawsuit.\n\nUdell\u2019s family is suing Best Buy on several counts, including negligence and loss of consortium. Lachazo, Gonzalez, X.M. Delivery Service and its owner Manuel Chavez, J.B. Hunt, and the two Best Buy employees who arranged for the washer and dryer to be delivered are also charged in the lawsuit.\n\nLachazo admitted to police that he attacked Udell and that he had been using cocaine and marijuana prior to the incident, according to an arrest report. He had been previously arrested for theft in 2018 and a history of traffic and driving-related citations.\n\nUdell suffered multiple skull and facial fractures, severe brain bleed and second and third-degree burns over the majority of her body, the police report said.\n\nBest Buy said in a statement that it would support legislation requiring background checks across the retail industry and offered to donate to a charity established by the Udell family in the wake of Evelyn\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cSpecific to our own practices, background checks have long been required by Best Buy and we are working with those we contract out to ensure that these checks are up-to-date and are done on a re-occurring basis,\u201d the company said. \u201cAdditionally, we continue to work with an independent security firm to review the practices of all third parties that we hire to do work on our behalf in customers\u2019 homes.\u201d\n\nJ.B. Hunt said in a statement that the company didn\u2019t directly employ Lachazo and that it had stopped working with X.M. Delivery Service amid a review of the firm\u2019s safety standards, reported NBC News.\n\nX.M. Delivery Service did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nUdell\u2019s family described Evelyn as a \u201cbeautiful, kind and giving\u201d grandmother, wife, mother, mother-in-law and sister who traveled extensively and volunteered at the local library.\n\n\u201cShe had been looking forward to her \u2018golden years,\u2019 with many more milestones to celebrate with her children and grandchildren; birthdays, graduations, weddings,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll of that was taken from her and from us,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cInstead, she faced unspeakable terror and pain in her final moments, having fallen victim to a barbaric, yet preventable attack that can be described as nothing short of torture. Our family stands before you today vowing to protect Evy\u2019s legacy and ensure that she did not die in vain.\u201d", "description": "Jorge Lachazo killed Evelyn Udell of Boca Raton, Florida, after installing her new washer and dryer, police say.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9141952200003400dfcb2e.png?cache=60adt7evlz&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
