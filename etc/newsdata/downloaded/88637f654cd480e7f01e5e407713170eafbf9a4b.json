He doesn\u2019t care about the tales of woe, of blown leads and bizarre innings in win-or-go-home games for this franchise in postseason play.\n\nSoto wants to dance \u2014 and dance he did Tuesday night, leading the Nationals to a dramatic comeback 4-3 win over the Milwaukee Brewers to win the National League Wild Card Game and sending his team into the NL Division Series, where they will face the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s electric eighth inning may not erase the sting of postseason failures past, but should go a long way to proving that happy endings are within the grasp of Washington sports teams.\n\nSoto, the 20-year-old Dominican who emerged as a star rookie last year and followed up with an impressive sophomore season, brought the soldout Nationals Park crowd of 43,993 to a fever pitch with a clutch game-winning hit in the bottom of the eighth.\n\nWith two outs and the bases loaded, facing ace reliever Josh Hader with the Nationals down 3-1, Soto drove a shot to right field that got past Trent Grisham and rolled long enough to score Michael A. Taylor, Andrew Stevenson and Anthony Rendon to give Washington a 4-3 lead.\n\nSoto would get caught between second and third for the final out of the inning, but the damage was done.\n\nReliever Daniel Hudson \u2014 one of the key acquisitions by general manager Mike Rizzo at the trade deadline to shore up what was then the worst bullpen in baseball \u2014 got the save, starting a celebration that two innings earlier seemed very unlikely.\n\nGoing into the eighth, Washington had managed just three hits. With Hader \u2014 he of the 2.62 ERA and 44 saves \u2014 coming in, it looked like the door was about to be slammed on the Nationals. But this team has confidence in its ability to come back. That\u2019s what happens when you turn a 19-31 start into a 93-69 finish.\n\nThe comeback wasn\u2019t an offensive explosion. Taylor was hit by a pitch, pinch hitter Ryan Zimmerman blooped a broken-bat single to center (replaced by Stevenson as a pinch runner) and Anthony Rendon walked.\n\nBut with two outs, Soto, the big bat in the order with his 34 home runs and 110 RBI, blasted a Hader pitch into right, and the dancing began.\n\nSoto almost talked his big hit into existence before the game.\n\n\u201cI feel amazing,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI feel really happy. I can\u2019t wait to see the crowd, how it\u2019s going to be today. I like those kind of games like that, when all the crowd, the team, everybody is working hard and proud of themselves. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nSoto\u2019s hit was a blast of joyous relief for a home crowd that has seen too many disappointments over the years in deciding postseason games.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
