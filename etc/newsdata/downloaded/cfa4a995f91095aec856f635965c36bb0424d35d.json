That\u2019s so weird you\u2019re thinking that, too,\u201d Zucker replied, before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be available but he is an immense talent and we\u2019re always looking for great talent.\u201d\n\nSmith, known for his critical coverage of President Donald Trump and his administration, announced October 11th on his weekday program Shepard Smith Reporting that it would be his last broadcast at the network. Smith joined Fox News in 1996 and covered major news stories for over two decades. He held the title of chief news anchor and managing editor of the outlet\u2019s breaking news unit.\n\nDuring his interview with Stelter, Zucker re-upped his criticisms of Fox News, contending that employees of the network \u201care not truth-tellers.\u201d He went on to say the network is \u201cnot a news organization\u201d and is \u201cakin to state-run TV.\u201d\n\nZucker also addressed whether he still harbors plans to run for public office one day.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of political offices that are interesting,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt is something I will look at at the appropriate time. I have no plans to do so at this time. Politics interests me.\u201d", "description": "CNN President Jeff Zucker signaled Thursday that he is \"very open\" to hiring former Fox News Channel daytime anchor Shepard Smith.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/jeff-zucker-shepard-smith-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
