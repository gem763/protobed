Another newbie, Chloe Fineman, appeared as Marianne Williamson\u2014live via astro-projection from outer space.\n\nThen came the \u201cactual candidates,\u201d including Kate McKinnon\u2019s Elizabeth Warren and\u2014yes!\u2014Larry David\u2019s Bernie Sanders, who exclaimed, \u201cHello, everyone! I\u2019m so excited to be back and ruin things a second time!\u201d\n\nHost Woody Harrelson debuted his Joe Biden impersonation\u2014ridiculous capped teeth and all. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry anymore: Daddy\u2019s here, America! I see you, I hear you, I sniff you, and I hug you from behind.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNow, as I ask anytime I walk into a room: Where am I? And what the hell is going on here?\u201d\n\nAnd, last but certainly not least, the great Maya Rudolph cameoed as Kamala Harris. In her pitch-perfect tone, she exclaimed, \u201cNow, Erin, that little girl you just introduced? That little girl is me. Just checking because, I\u2019m not just that little girl. I\u2019m also America\u2019s cool aunt. A fun aunt. I call that a \u2018Funt.\u2019 The kind of Funt that will give you weed but then arrest you for having weed. Can I win the presidency? Probably not. Can I successfully seduce a much younger man? You better funting believe it.\u201d", "description": "The acclaimed actor (and the night\u2019s host) stepped in to debut his entertaining impersonation of the Democratic frontrunner.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_798,w_1418,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569732352/Screen_Shot_2019-09-29_at_12.25.22_AM_nya7zf", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
