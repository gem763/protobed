I got a lot of weird DMs in my inbox.\u2019\n\nThe 34\u2013year-old later admitted that he had no idea what he was getting himself into as he took part in the shoot, and he realised that the calendar was only going to feature shots of his character.\n\n\u2018I remember late in the season last year, we were doing a big Amazon promotional shoot. We were all there on set doing group shots.\n\n\u2018They pulled me over to a green screen and told me, \u201cWe\u2019re doing calendars.\u201d I\u2019m thinking, okay, everyone\u2019s got a calendar. That\u2019s great! But no. It was just me!\u2019\n\nChace later recalled \u2018grabbing props and doing silly stuff\u2019 as he had his photos taken for the calendar while confessing he enjoyed the shoot, calling it \u2018cheesy\u2019 and \u2018really funny\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Boys has become an instant hit, and it has become one of Amazon Prime\u2019s most popular series following its premiere back in July.\n\nOff of the back of the show\u2019s success, it\u2019s been renewed for a second season.\n\nSeason one of The Boys is available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
