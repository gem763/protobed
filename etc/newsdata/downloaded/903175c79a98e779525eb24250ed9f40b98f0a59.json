India's citizenship drive hits women hardest", "language": "en", "text": "By Anuradha Nagaraj\n\nGUWAHATI, India, Oct 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abanti Deka had no idea when she married her husband that taking his name would jeopardise her Indian citizenship.\n\nThat was before authorities in the northeast Indian state of Assam, where she has lived all her life, launched a vast and highly contentious exercise to register all its citizens as part of a campaign against illegal immigration.\n\nWhen the register was published at the end of August, the names of nearly 2 million of the state's about 33 million people were missing, plunging them into a bureaucratic nightmare that human rights experts fear could render some stateless.\n\nAbanti was one of the unlucky ones.\n\n\"The notice came suddenly,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at her lawyer's office.\n\n\"I don't understand. I was born here, I have voted here before, but suddenly none of that matters any more.\"\n\nResentment against illegal immigrants has simmered for years in Assam, one of India's poorest states, with residents blaming outsiders for taking their jobs and land.\n\nTo be included on the register, residents had to produce documents proving their families lived in India before March 24, 1971, when hundreds of thousands of people began fleeing conflict across the border in what is now Bangladesh.\n\nLawyers and campaigners dealing with such cases say they present particular challenges for women.\n\nAbout one in three women in Assam is illiterate - a higher proportion than for men - and many marry young, moving away from home and losing access to any documents that might prove their origins.\n\nThey also take their husbands' names, a move that has complicated things further for many married women in a region where family names are markers of ethnic and religious affiliation.\n\n\"The women have had to pay a higher price,\" said Tanya Laskar, a lawyer working on such cases.\n\n\"They have struggled the hardest to get relevant documents and many failed because they were child brides or the family did not put their names on a land document because women are not entitled to property in many homes.\"\n\nPRESSURE\n\nIndia is expected to face pressure at a major intergovernmental meeting in Geneva on Monday to assess progress in a global decade-long campaign aimed at eradicating statelessness by 2024.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi expressed concerns that the Assam exercise could result in some people being made stateless.\n\nThere are an estimated 10-15 million stateless people worldwide who are not recognised as nationals of any country and are deprived of basic rights most people take for granted such as education and healthcare.\n\nThose excluded from India's register will have 120 days to prove their citizenship at hundreds of regional quasi-judicial bodies known as foreigners' tribunals. If that goes against them, they can appeal all the way up to India's Supreme Court.\n\n'LONELY BATTLES'\n\nFrom land deeds to school leaving certificates, voter lists and birth certificates, residents of Assam have had to spend thousands of rupees to access their documents from government offices.\n\nLaskar, who runs awareness campaigns on the process, said poorer families often spent their limited resources on the men.\n\n\"In poor families, a woman's right to justice comes at the end,\" she said. \"We have had women fainting in our awareness meetings because they are so worried of what lies ahead. Many know that they will have to fight lonely battles.\"\n\nEducation is another factor, said Digambar Narzary, head of the Nedan Foundation, a human rights charity that works in a remote autonomous region inhabited mostly by tribal people.\n\n\"In many parts of the state, access to education for girls has been a challenge,\" she said.\n\n\"Since they haven't been to school or dropped out early, they do not have essential school leaving documents that establish one's age and other details.\"\n\nState authorities have not provided a breakdown of men and women omitted from the register. But many married women like Abanti say they have been left off even though their siblings and parents were included.\n\nAmong them is Aladi Mondol, 42, the only member of the family she was born into whose name is not on the citizens' register.\n\nMondol lost key documents in flooding, common in Assam, and said she did not realise how important they would become.", "description": "Abanti Deka had no idea when she married her husband that taking his name would jeopardise her Indian citizenship.
