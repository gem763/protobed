REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) are not in discussions over a deal due to regulatory issues, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, after the Wall Street Journal reported on.wsj.com/2kS2Hbs the wireless carrier was considering parting ways with its satellite TV division DirecTV.\n\nAT&T has also considered a spinoff of DirecTV into a separate public company, the report said.\n\nLast week, at a conference AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens cited regulatory hurdles for any deal.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s been some stories out there about the industrial logic about putting 2 satellite providers. It hasn\u2019t been successful and I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any change in that regulatory perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nDirecTV has been bleeding satellite TV subscribers with users shifting to cheaper online streaming services like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Prime service.\n\nAT&T lost 778,000 premium TV subscribers, which includes DirecTV users in the second quarter, more than the 544,000 it lost in the prior quarter, and expects the video losses to continue in the current quarter.\n\nShares of the wireless carrier rose 1% in after-market trading and those of Dish were up 1.8%.
