I went outside and saw her lying on the ground being given CPR.'\n\nMs Crestani (left) grew up in Wellington with her identical twin sister before moving to Dunedin to attend university two years ago\n\n'People started falling down the stairs onto one another, that's when the panic set in, people thinking 'I don't want to be the one on the floor'.\n\n'I don't think a lot of people realised what happened. It was awful. It was so totally packed, once you're under, you're under.''\n\nOtago Coastal Area commander Inspector Marty Gray held a press conference after Ms Crestani's death insisting it was 'too early' to understand the circumstances.\n\n'It's not a time to sort of point fingers or to indicate that anything sinister went on. It's for us to rally around this community who are hurting and for a very good reason,' Insp Gray said.\n\nThe party was reportedly held as a 'farewell' to the building - known as 'The Manor' which had been used to host parties for years prior to the university selling it\n\nHe said his department were initially contacted by Campus Watch at 11.55pm on Saturday night asking them to shut down a party at a recently sold student accommodation building.\n\nThe party was reportedly held as a 'farewell' to the building which had been used to host parties for years prior to the university selling it.\n\nFive minutes later, they received another call. A partygoer pleaded with police to come and help clear everybody out.\n\n'When our officers arrived there was\u2026 about 500 or 600 partygoers, a lot of them anxious, a lot of them trying to get out of the premises, a lot of them trying to get in the premises, a lot of disorganisation, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of anxiety,' he said.\n\n'The victim was carried out of the house by other people and resuscitation attempts were made at that time.'\n\nTwo other students were reportedly injured at the party.", "description": "Between 500 and 600 University of Otago students attended an end of exams celebration party in Dunedin, New Zealand , on Saturday night.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/23/19374308-0-image-a-11_1570402198405.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
