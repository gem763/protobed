Bernie Sanders jumped to Democratic Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s defense Monday against unfounded allegations that she is a Russian asset, which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and commentators at multiple news outlets have recently floated.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard has put her life on the line to defend this country. People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset,\u201d Sanders said of his fellow Democratic presidential hopeful on Twitter.\n\nAllegations that Gabbard is a Russian asset have picked up steam in recent weeks as some establishment Democrats have expressed concern that she will run a third-party campaign that could draw votes from the eventual Democratic nominee.\n\nThe New York Times published an article on Oct. 12 airing some of those concerns. On Oct. 15, CNN commentator Bakari Sellers called Gabbard a \u201cpuppet\u201d for the Russian government.\n\nClinton took the accusation to a new level earlier in October, claiming in an interview that the Russian government was \u201cgrooming\u201d Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate, seemingly to help President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians.\u201d\n\nGabbard, 38, responded to Clinton\u2019s comments in an interview with Tucker Carlson on Friday. She said that Clinton\u2019s remarks were a slap in the face to \u201cevery veteran in this country, every service member, every American, anyone watching at home fighting for peace and who was calling for an end to these regime change wars.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who served in the Hawaii Army National Guard during the Iraq war, is considered an anti-interventionist, and has opposed efforts to overthrow Bashar al Assad as president of Syria.\n\nGabbard resigned as vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee in February 2016, and endorsed Sanders for president over Clinton. Gabbard had argued for more primary debates, putting her at odds with other DNC officials, and the Clinton campaign.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
