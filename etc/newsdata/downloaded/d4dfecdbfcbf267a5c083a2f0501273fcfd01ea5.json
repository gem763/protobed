An earlier version of the report found an eye-opening $930 million spent between 2013 and 2016 \"didn't provide best value to support Army recruiting.\"\n\nThe Army's new marketing leads \u2014 assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs E. Casey Wardynski and enterprise marketing chief Brigadier General Alex Fink \u2014 told Business Insider how they plan to ensure a greater return on that investment by holding themselves to the same standards as any other major advertiser.\n\nRead more: The US Army has struggled to get recruits. Its new marketing heads explain how the military will target Gen Z with personalized, data-driven ads.\n\nThe Army revamped its events strategy and plans to update its internal data system\n\nThe audit led to a complete overhaul of the Army's marketing operations.\n\nMost of the programs labeled ineffective concerned events marketing, so Wardynski said the Army is abandoning efforts like the Tough Mudder series, which cost about $2 million and only led to seven contracts. Instead, it's focusing on conventions like Comic-Con and gamer gathering Pax, where the Army can set up virtual recruiting stations and quickly see ROI.\n\nLast month, the Army introduced its new esports team at Pax West in Seattle. Wardynski said gamers \"make good soldiers\" due to their ability to absorb information.\n\nThe audit also faulted Army employees for failing to enter data -- into what it calls its enterprise marketing management system -- that tracks campaign results or submitting incorrect numbers.\n\nFink said improving that record is one of his key goals; IT firm Booz Allen Hamilton recently won a $152 million contract to develop software for managing recruitment and retention, and the Army eventually hopes to combine the two systems.\n\nArmy leaders say they would hold themselves and their agencies to a higher standard\n\nAs part of its 2019 defense spending bill, Congress withheld 50% of the Army's marketing budget pending a report on the audit by then-Secretary of the Army Mark T. Esper, who was confirmed as President Trump's Defense Secretary in July.\n\nEsper's report led the Army to slash the size of its marketing organization from 60-plus employees to 20 and move it to Chicago, blocks away from its new ad agency of record DDB and parent company Omnicom.\n\nWardynski and Fink called the new Chicago division the product of a collaboration between the US Office of Personnel Management, the Army, and unnamed marketing execs that it brought on to advise them.\n\nWardynski said the new group, called Office of the Chief Army Enterprise Marketing, may eventually grow to more than 50 employees and that there would be an emphasis on hiring longtime military staff who are better equipped than civilians to translate the military experience to its ads.\n\nFink also reports to a newly formed governing board consisting of Wardynski, deputy chief of staff Lt. General Thomas C. Seamands, and Lt. General Paul Funk, who was appointed commanding officer of Army Training and Doctrine Command in March to lead the overhaul of its recruitment efforts.\n\nSince Congress ultimately controls the purse strings, Army marketing leaders addressed the Senate and House Armed Services Committees in January 2018, after Adweek broke news of the audit. Since then, Wardynski said his team has continually updated Congress about its move from a focus on broad-reach TV campaigns to a targeted and data-driven one.\n\nFinally, the Army plans to make ad agencies DDB and OMD more accountable by attaching numeric goals to every budget item and offering incentives to get the best results.\n\nFink said if a platform doesn't deliver \u2014 linear TV included \u2014 he would quickly move on to one that does.", "description": "US Army restructured its marketing operations after an audit found millions in ineffective spending.
