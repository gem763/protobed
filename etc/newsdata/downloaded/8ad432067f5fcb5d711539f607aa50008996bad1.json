Biron and Adela Suliman\n\nWASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - M usic teacher and composer Haskell Small remembers when the noise became too much for him.\n\n\"I couldn't find a place to get some fresh air without noise,\" he said of the day a half-decade ago.\n\nSmall, 71, who works out of his Washington home, said the focus of his ire was a specific piece of lawn equipment: the gas-powered leaf blower.\n\n\"I accept that living in a city will have more noise, but this particular type of noise is piercing and very loud - aaargh!\" he yelled at the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nMany in his neighbourhood felt the same way, so they organised and, last December, convinced the city to join more than 100 other U.S. jurisdictions in banning the blowers in favour of quieter battery-operated machines. Washington's action against auditory assault is just one example of a growing trend of cities around the world purposefully trying to slow and quiet urban life, with an eye on improving health and wellbeing.\n\nEfforts to slow the pace of city life range from the literal - with many cities pushing for lower speed limits on their roads - to the imaginative, such as looking for ways to promote mindfulness.\n\nMany of them include a recognition of the rising importance of public spaces that are geared more toward quiet and contemplation than efficiency and technology.\n\nNoise, for example, is the \"new secondhand smoke\", according to the Quiet Coalition, a Massachusetts-based non-profit.\n\n\"We're in a noisier and noisier world,\" said the group's executive director, Jamie L. Banks. Finding ways to change that is \"urgent\", he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has said the health risks of living in noisy cities can include hearing loss, cardiovascular disease and sleep disorders.\n\nEurope has been particularly proactive on the issue, adopting a directive in 2002 that aims to reduce environmental noise pollution. It warns European Union members that prolonged exposure could lead to \"harmful effects\" on health.\n\nBut in the United States, there has been no federal regulation on noise since the late 1970s. That has left local jurisdictions such as Washington to act in response to growing public demand for quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\n'VACCINE' FOR ILLS OF MODERNITY?\n\nThe idea of cities trying to lower the volume and slow down is not new.\n\nThis year, a global network of more than 260 cities will celebrate 20 years of stepping on the brakes.\n\nThe Cittaslow - or Slow City - network began in Italy in 1999 and takes its inspiration from the Slow Food movement. It grades its members according to factors such as sustainable infrastructure, promotion of local economies and fairness.\n\n\"The effect is positive connection, because we put people in contact with each other,\" said secretary general Pier Giorgio Oliveti of the network that spans 30 countries so far.\n\nCittaslow's approach could be \"a vaccine\" for the ills of modernity, he said.\n\nFor instance, since its entry into the slow-city network in 2015, Lidzbark in Poland has redeveloped its riverfront, introduced free electric public transport, and built new bike lanes and a public square, according to its mayor Maciej Sitarek.\n\n\"Our residents have begun to recognise the meaning of a slower but still good life,\" he said by email.\n\nOne of the network's larger members is Jeonju, a South Korean city of about 650,000 people that sits on the Jeonjucheon River.\n\nPart of the Cittaslow network since 2016 - though one historic village in its boundaries joined in 2010 - Jeonju's leaders have sought to slow the city while maintaining its identity.\n\nThey run monthly car-free zones, hope to plant 10 million trees by 2026 and are \"transforming a straight eight-lane road into a curvy four-lane road\" with a slower speed limit, Mayor Seung-su Kim said in an email interview.\n\n\"We are going through a phase to become a better city in the future,\" he added.\n\nHowever, the Jeonju projects have seen some pushback, Kim acknowledged, with a share of residents complaining that the lower speed limits make driving more complicated, while others say trying to maintain old traditions could hamper development.\n\nSome international experts also have expressed concern that many of the feel-good interventions integral to the slow cities movement mainly are available only in wealthier communities or to people living in small towns.", "description": "WASHINGTON/LONDON, Oct 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - M usic teacher and composer Haskell Small remembers when the noise became too much for him.
