Insider has not independently verified Lauer's claims, and Nevils slammed his comments as a \"case study in victim blaming.\"\n\nKristen Houser, chief public affairs officer for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, told Insider that Nevils' allegations are \"a pretty standard example of what we see in abusive relationships.\"\n\nHouser told Insider that abusers often control victims through power over aspects of their lives, which might cause victims to continue the relationship, or at least remain in contact.\n\nShe said often victims are trying to rationalize what happened, make sense of it all, and control the narrative, adding that there is also a fear that there could be additional consequences if they speak out.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nBrooke Nevils, who accuses Matt Lauer of rape in Ronan Farrow's new book, \"Catch and Kill,\" told Farrow that she was terrified of the control Lauer had over her career.\n\nNevils's comments echo what many victims of abuse face in their relationships with abusers, according to Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.\n\nVictims, Houser said, may remain in contact with their abusers to rationalize what happened, or out of fear that there could be additional consequences if they leave or speak out.\n\nThe rape accusation against Lauer was first published by Variety on Tuesday. Nevils told Farrow that Lauer raped her in a hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, after a night of drinking. She alleged that Lauer pushed her against a wall and kissed her, then pushed her on to the bed and raped her.\n\nLauer denied the rape allegation on Wednesday and said that all sexual encounters between him and Nevils were consensual. Insider has not independently verified Lauer's claims. Nevils criticized Lauer's comments as a \"case study in victim blaming\" and Farrow said his book went through a \"meticulous\" fact-checking process.\n\nHouser described Nevils's allegations are \"a pretty standard example of what we see in abusive relationships frequently.\"\n\nBrooke Nevils said she feared the control Matt Lauer had over her career. An expert says this is fairly common.\n\nNevils told Farrow she and Lauer had more sexual encounters in New York, and that she felt pressured to continue it because she was terrified of the control he had over her and her career.\n\nAt the time of the incident in Sochi, Nevils was working at NBC for Meredith Vieira, who worked closely with Lauer.\n\nMatt Lauer and Meredith Vieira.

Maintaining contact came up in the Bill Cosby case, it happens on college campuses. People do this to try to make sense of what happened to them, and try to ensure there's not ongoing risk of reputation damage,\" Houser told Insider.\n\nMatt Lauer is pictured reporting from the Sochi Olympics, a trip during which he is said to have raped a colleague.
