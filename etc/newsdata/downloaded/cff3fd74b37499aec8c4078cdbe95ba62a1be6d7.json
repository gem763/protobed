a reminder of the extent of the opposition his reforms have attracted in some quarters.\n\nAnd after some of the state's tight controls were lifted, the simmering ethnic tensions in this diverse country boiled over into violence which has forced some 2.5 million people from their homes.\n\nIn June 2019, two of Mr Abiy's close allies were killed in what was described as an attempt to seize control of the Amhara region, scene of some of the worst violence.\n\nAbiy's first six months\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption People celebrated as the land border between Ethiopia and Eritrea was reopened\n\n2 April 2018 - becomes prime minister after unexpected resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn\n\nMay - frees thousands of political detainees, including opposition leader Andargachew Tsege\n\n5 June - lifts state of emergency two months early\n\n5 June - agrees to accept border ruling giving disputed territory to Eritrea\n\n9 July - alongside the Eritrean president declares the end of war between the two countries\n\n11 September - reopens land border with Eritrea\n\n16 October - appoints women to half of ministerial posts\n\nWho is Abiy Ahmed?\n\nMr Abiy's background is crucial to the way people view him.\n\nHe is the country's first Oromo leader - the ethnic group at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests, which left many dead and thousands arrested following clashes with security forces.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nOne of the protesters' main complaints was that they had been politically, economically and culturally marginalised for years - despite being the country's largest community.\n\nThe coming to power of Mr Abiy, who is believed to have huge support among the Oromo youth as well as other ethnic groups, has begun to change that.\n\nHe is leader of the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), one of the four ethnic parties which make up the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition.\n\nMore about Abiy's impact:\n\nThe 42-year-old, who was born in the city of Agaro in Oromia and comes from a mixed Christian-Muslim family, joined the OPDO in the late 1980s.\n\nIn the military he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, before becoming the founder and director of the country's Information Network and Security Agency, which is responsible for cyber-security in a country where the government has always exercised tight control over the internet.\n\nAfter that he became the minister for science and technology.\n\nHe has promised to free up the telecoms sector, which is currently dominated by a state-run monopoly.\n\nHowever, old habits seem to die hard and in June 2019 the internet was blocked throughout the country for several weeks. The authorities never gave a reason but it coincided with national exams and may have been a draconian attempt to prevent cheating.\n\nKey facts: Abiy Ahmed\n\nBorn in Agaro in southern Ethiopia on 15 August 1976 to an Oromo Muslim father and an Amhara Christian mother\n\nAs a teenager in 1990, he joined the armed struggle against the Marxist Derg regime\n\nHe has a doctorate degree in peace and security issues from Addis Ababa University and a master's degree in transformational leadership from the University of Greenwich, London\n\nSpeaks fluent Afan Oromo, Amharic and Tigrinya, as well as English\n\n1995: Served as a UN peacekeeper in Rwanda\n\n2007: Founded the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency (INSA) and served as a board member of Ethio Telecom, Ethiopian TV\n\n2010: Entered politics as an ordinary OPDO member before joining the party's Executive Committee in 2015\n\n2016: Briefly served as minister of science and technology\n\n2018: Became prime minister\n\nThe speed at which he has been changing Ethiopia has been unprecedented but should not be a surprise.\n\nHe laid out his political vision in comments made to the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement's (SEPDM), a constituent party of the ruling coalition, in October 2017\n\n\"We have only one option and that is to be united, not only cooperating and helping each other but uniting in order to live together. The other option is to kill each other,\" Mr Abiy is quoted as saying.\n\n\"However, no sane person will opt for this. So, our option should be to trust one another, heal our wounds together and work together to develop our country.\"\n\nWhat does the opposition think?\n\nWhen Mr Abiy came into power, he was seen by many as outspoken and competent, with a participatory leadership style. It left opposition figures cautiously optimistic about the future, as long as he tackled the issues behind the unrest.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Opposition leader Berhanu Nega was feted on his return in September\n\nOpposition leader Berhanu Nega, once branded a terrorist in Ethiopia, has returned home, pledging that he will work closely with the government \"to stabilise the country\".\n\nBut he was not giving a free pass to the prime minster, saying that \"many institutions and many laws\" need to be reformed to create a meaningful democracy.\n\nEthiopia has had general elections every five years since 1995, but in the last vote in 2015 not a single opposition MP was elected.\n\nJournalist and activist Jawar Mohammed was at one time accused of stoking anti-government protests. He has ended his exile and described Mr Abiy's appointment as \"a unique opportunity [for a] peaceful transition to democracy\".\n\nYeshiwas Assefa, who leads the opposition Blue Party, told the BBC: \"The main point is he has to be someone who understands the demands of the public and the public's desire for change... He has to reform institutions in dire need of reform.\"\n\nThe next elections are due in 2020, and will be keenly watched to see if the reforms do mean that opposition parties are free to campaign against Mr Abiy and the governing EPRDF, in a way that was previously impossible.", "description": "Since becoming prime minister, Abiy Ahmed has changed Ethiopia more than many could have imagined.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6A44/production/_102440272_mediaitem102440271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
