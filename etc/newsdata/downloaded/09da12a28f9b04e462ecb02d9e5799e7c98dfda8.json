Andrew Cuomo announced this week that new HIV diagnoses in the state dropped to 2,481 in 2018, a historic low.\n\nIt's a victory for Cuomo's \"Ending the Epidemic\" initiative, launched in 2014, which aimed to connect undiagnosed patients with proper care and prevent high-risk New Yorkers from contracting the virus, the governor's office said.\n\nIn 2018, nearly 32,000 New Yorkers took pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a drug that can reduce users' risk of getting HIV from sex by nearly 99%. That's a 32% increase in PrEP users from 2017, the office said.\n\nThe state has spent $20 million per year since 2015 to fund the initiative. This year, the state's health department announced it will require all health insurers to cover PrEP without co-pay in 2020.", "description": "New York could end the AIDS epidemic in the state by the end of next year, the governor's office said.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160206152814-gov-cuomo-jan-29-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
