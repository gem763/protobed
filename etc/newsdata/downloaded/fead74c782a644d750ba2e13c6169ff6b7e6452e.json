Now we're entering dream holiday territory.\n\nThe good news is that it's very much a reality, as one luxury travel firm is hiring someone to do just that.\n\nUnforgettable Greece, a new travel firm which launched earlier this year, is looking to hire someone to travel around Greece, and share their experiences on social media.\n\nIn fact, the chosen applicant will be sent on a luxury nine-day tour of Greece through Athens, Mykonos, Santorini and Crete - and they can bring a friend along too.\n\nEverything is steeped in luxury from stays in swanky accommodation, getting private transfers everywhere and even enjoying private tours of highlights at each destination.\n\nWe're talking a private guided tour of the Acropolis, a jeep island tour of Mykonos' best beaches, sunset sailing in Santorini, a private cooking class in Crete and even a Samsung S10 to get some seriously great photos.\n\nOh, and they will even pay the lucky jet-setter \u00a3500 payment for their troubles.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn return, the candidate will be expected to share their experiences on the Unforgettable Greece social media channels.\n\nYou'll need to be \"someone with a passion for travel and photography\" and who knows social media inside out, including the best travel hashtags and the right captions/photos to get those all-important likes.\n\nThink you'd be perfect? To enter, simply upload your best travel photo (taken by you) on Instagram and tag @unforgettablegreece , using the hashtag #UnforgettableInstagrammer in your caption.\n\nYou'll need to do so by Friday 15th November 2019 at 11.59pm when the applications will close.\n\nYou can find out more and read the full terms and conditions on the Unforgettable Greece website .\n\nNow, you've just got to decide who you're going to take along if you bag the role...", "description": "One luxury travel firm is hiring someone to go on free Greece holidays and they'll let you bring a friend along for the ride", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "E", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12227354.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Strike-a-pose.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
