REUTERS/Shokry Hussien\n\nAnalysts have hailed Egypt for tough economic reforms tied to a three-year, $12 billion loan program with the IMF agreed in late 2016, which has been disbursed in full.\n\nThe reforms included devaluing the currency by about half, cutting energy subsidies and introducing a value-added tax. Those changes have left many of Egypt\u2019s nearly 100 million citizens struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn its World Economic Outlook, the Fund brought down its 2019/2020 forecast for consumer price inflation to 10% from 12.3% six months ago.\n\nEgypt said its economy grew by 5.6% in the 2018/19 year, slightly above the IMF\u2019s estimate of 5.5%, unchanged from April.\n\nThe World Bank forecast on Thursday that Egypt\u2019s economy would grow by 5.8% this fiscal year and estimated it grew 5.6% in 2018/2019, matching the government\u2019s figure.\n\nThe IMF forecast Egypt\u2019s current account deficit would widen to 2.8% of GDP this fiscal year from its 1.7% estimate in April. It also widened its estimate for last year\u2019s current account deficit to 3.1% from 2.4%.\n\nThe IMF improved its expectations for unemployment in Egypt, predicting it would fall to 7.9% this fiscal year, down from its estimate of 8.3% six months ago. It also estimated unemployment in 2018/19 at 8.6%, below its April expectation of 9.6%.\n\n\u201cA loss of reform momentum would reduce growth and potential output and put pressure on unemployment, given the fast-increasing labor force,\u201d the IMF said in its final review of Egypt\u2019s reform program, written in July and released this month.\n\n\u201cThe transition to a transparent market-based economy will require further broadening and deepening of reforms and their sustained implementation beyond the current program, particularly regarding long-standing problems of weak governance, rent seeking, vulnerabilities to corruption, and the heavy presence of the state in the economy.\u201d\n\nThe IMF said last year that Egypt will have a working age population of 80 million by 2028. Creating jobs for so many people will be a challenge for a country with a notoriously bloated and inefficient public sector, and where the state controls vast swathes of the economy.", "description": "Egypt's economy is expected to grow 5.9% in the year ending in June, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday -- unchanged from its April forecast but below the government's target of 6% to 7%.", "authors": ["Yousef Saba", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441115045&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E13V", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
