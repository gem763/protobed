That's remarkable for that to happen,' a Fox Sports commentator said.\n\nThe C02 was fed into his helmet from the dry ice in his cool suit system instead of the air that it is supposed to filter through.\n\nAs a result of the malfunction Kostecki (left) suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and passed out behind the wheel of the race car\n\nThe wild card driver was competing for his family's team at the endurance race.\n\nAfter a quick medical check Kostecki was cleared to race and he chose to continue on and start the race.\n\n'I'm pretty much back to 100 per cent now,' he told FOX Sports.\n\n'It was a bit scary in the car, I just went to flick my helmet air on and the cool suit wasn't connected up properly inside the (cool) box. I was just breathing in all the dry ice.'", "description": "Brodie Kostecki had one of the worst starts to the Bathhurst 1000 possible, suffering carbon monoxide poisoning after toxic gas flooded his helmet.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/05/19645432-0-image-a-42_1570940730528.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
