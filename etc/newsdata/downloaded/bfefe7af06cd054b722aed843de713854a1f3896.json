(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nDemocratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden on Thursday evening touted his 2012 remarks expressing strong support for same-sex marriage, comments which put then-president Barack Obama in a difficult position and led to Obama\u2019s full-throated support on the issue.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying one another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties,\u201d Biden told NBC in May, 2012.\n\nThe former vice president remarks caused a controversy at the time, as Obama had only said his views on gay marriage were \u201cevolving.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that caused no consternation at all,\u201d Biden quipped to the crowd at Thursday\u2019s town hall focusing on LGBT issues, which was hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation on the eve of National Coming Out Day. His remark was met with laughter.\n\n\u201cBarack knew my position,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cI was going to be a good boy \u2026 unless I was asked.\u201d\n\nBiden apologized to Obama in 2012 for speaking too soon on the issue.\n\n\u201cI had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention,\u201d Obama said at the time.\n\nCNN\u2019s town hall on LGBT issues featured nine Democratic presidential candidates, not including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who cancelled campaign events after suffering a heart attack.", "description": "Joe Biden on Thursday evening touted his 2012 remarks expressing strong support for same-sex marriage, comments which put then-president Barack Obama in a difficult position and led to Obama's full-throated support on the issue.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
