I feel like I\u2019m playing really well, I\u2019m at full fitness levels, playing every minute possible in games and I feel like I\u2019m performing the best I have done for Burnley.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the England manager\u2019s decision to pick the players he feels suits his system so I\u2019m not going to cry about it and get all upset. I\u2019m just going to crack on with my game and enjoy myself when I\u2019m playing.\u201dTarkowski has not spoken to anyone from the England set-up since being left out of the squad for the Nations League finals in the summer.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I\u2019m a footballer and I want to play football, whether that\u2019s being a part of the squad for England, starting for England or playing for Burnley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m desperate to be back involved in the England squad but for now I\u2019m happy in the Burnley one. We\u2019re performing well as a team and I want to improve on my own performances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to starting whinging about not being involved, it\u2019s the manager\u2019s job to pick the players. He\u2019s decided that he doesn\u2019t want me in the squad so that\u2019s fair enough.\u201d\n\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche addressed the issue ahead of the Clarets\u2019 victory over Everton last weekend, also making a case for Tarkowski\u2019s centre-back partner Ben Mee.\n\n\u201cFor (Tarkowski) and Ben, they both scratch their heads,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cI definitely think either or both should be considered at very close quarters to be in the England set-up, at least.\u201d\n\nMee was capped up until under-21 level but has not been involved in a senior squad.\n\nTarkowski is certainly a big fan of the 30-year-old Burnley captain, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody plays at Premier League level for as long as he has now, four years in a row, and plays every game.\n\n\u201cHe never gets injured and his performances are consistent. Maybe he\u2019s overlooked, but everybody here at the club appreciates how big a player he is for us. I certainly do.\u201d", "description": "James Tarkowski admits he was disappointed not to be included in the England squad for the matches against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.
