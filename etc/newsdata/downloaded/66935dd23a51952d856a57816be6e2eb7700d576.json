It has been a while since we interacted. An inquisitive mind, a curious soul as you were while you lived on this planet, you must be curious to know how we in India are doing. You must be eagerly awaiting news about the sapling\u2014Mohammedan Anglo Oriental College\u2013you planted in 1877 which grew up into a huge tree and took shape of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in 1920.\n\nBut before I tell you what is happening at your beloved AMU, my respected sir, allow me to talk about the country, India, frist. You loved India, didn\u2019t you? Yes, you did. You likened India to a beautiful dulhan (bride) and called Hindus and Muslims her twinkling eyes and warned the two communities against harming each other lest the bride gets blind.\n\nBut let me tell you frankly that the two communities have forgotten your sage words. Just as the country has forgotten many other lessons from the past. We break our cherished values which defined India. We trample the idea of India under feet and smother its uniqueness with our own hands.\n\nEverything that goes against our tolerant, pluralistic, multicultural ethos is being welcomed. Everything that binds India together, describes its delightful mosaic is being tossed out of the window.\n\nLet me cite some examples. And I am not going to discuss here how many innocents have been battered to death in a madness called mob lynching. I am not going to give you a laundry list of how many cities, towns, and kasbas, in an attempt to erase medieval memories, have been renamed.\n\nSir Syed, if you were to travel back to India, perhaps you would be shocked at the monstrosities being perpetrated on the monuments. Well, you loved monuments, right? Yes, you loved them a lot. Or why else you would risk your limb and life and sit in a basket and get hung to the Qutub Minar to read the inscriptions on its stones? You loved history. And essentially it is the history which is under assault by those who think history itself has given them an opportunity to rewrite it.\n\nWhile we are talking of history, I am reminded of the poet Allama Iqbal. The same Iqbal who, a couple of years after your death in 1898 in Aligarh, penned the immensely patriotic poem Sare Jahan Se Achcha. But, Sir Syed, Iqbal also paid a beautiful tribute to you through his poem remarkably powerful poem \u201cSyed Ki Lauh-e-Turbat (Gravestone of Syed).\u201d\n\nThe poem is actually an invitation to reflect, to get reformed. Through the poem, Iqbal makes Sir Syed address his community. The poem becomes a vehicle for Sir Syed to reach out to scholars, intellectuals, writers and journalists. \u201cMuddwa tera agar duniya mein hain taleem-e-deen/Tarke duniya quam ko apni na sikhlana kahein (If giving religious education is your purpose/Don\u2019t teach them to abdicate from the world),\u201dgoes a line. This is the mantra Sir Syed preached and practiced.\n\nSir Syed, I am pained to tell you how today Iqbal and his timeless creations are being mistreated in new India. Like the man, his message too is being misunderstood. Last night I saw a news clip where they reported that how a government school principal in Pilibhit district of Uttar Pradesh has been suspended for allowing children to sing Iqbal\u2019s famous dua (prayer) Lab pe aati hai\u2026 In this poem children seek God\u2019s guidance to a honest, kind and just life. \u201cMere Allah budaee se bachana mujhko/Nek jo raah ho us rah pe chalana mujhko (My God, save me from the path of sin/Put me on the path of righteousness),\u201d goes a line. Many of us sang this song in school. Nobody objected to it then. There is no reason to oppose its singing now. But, I am told, the District Magistrate, an IAS officer, acting on a communal man\u2019s complaint, without verifying the context and trying to understand the meaning of the lyrical nazm, has suspended the headmaster and ordered the school shut. Where innocent children seek divine blessings for good, pious character, they see an Islamic chant, a propaganda of religion.\n\nWhen my 9th grader daughter heard of this nonsensical action, she became livid. \u201cWhat is wrong with that song?,\u201d she asked angrily. \u201cEvery day we pray to God through a song in English. So, have we become Christians? Daddy, what is the use of that man\u2019s clearing the tough and prestigious IAS exam?,\u201d she asked.\n\nI felt like telling my daughter: \u201cBeta, there is a lot of use of such an officer in new India. Bharat badal raha hai. You are too young to understand the mindset behind such an action.\u201d But I didn\u2019t tell her that. I don\u2019t want to colour her vision and poison her mind with the hateful behavior of a few.\n\nSir Syed, Aligs or the alumni of your university, hold you in utmost esteem. But do they follow the roadmap that you showed? I doubt. Yes, on the morning of October 17, many will turn up at your grave in the grand mosque\u2019s premises in the heart of the university to offer customary fateha (prayers) and flowers. Recitations of the Quran too will be held to seek maghfirat (forgiving) for you. Eloquent speeches will be delivered, recalling your unmatched services to the community and the country. Many will also recite panegyric poems, draw powerful paintings and hold plays, underlining your message and eulogizing your achievements. The best part of the celebrations, of course, will be left for the night. It is dinner. The feast held in night should be called dinner. But we, Sir Syed\u2019s beloved children, his diehard fans, call this feast \u201cSir Syed Day Dinner.\u201d How we craved and continue to crave for this communal feast? Rich and poor, highly qualified and not-so-qualified, seniors and juniors, teachers and taught\u2014we all eat the dinner together.\n\nBut Sir Syed, while we remember you on your birthday, we also admit we have not lived up to your expectations. At the foundation ceremony of MAO College, you had said: \u201cThis college may expand into a university whose sons /daughters shall go forth through the length and breadth of the land to preach the gospel of free enquiry, large-heated tolerance and of pure morality.\u201d You never discriminated against anyone, kept the college\u2019s door open for everyone.\n\nTo a great extent, your prophecy has come true. But a lot needs to be done. Aligs have failed to communicate the true meaning of education to a huge section of our country. There is a trust deficit. Lack of communications between communities mar our march to future.\n\nLike others, most Aligs have cocooned themselves to their own world. Many of them inhabit a world which is exclusive, isolated. They entered the university, benefitted from the resources that the alma mater offered, left it and never returned. They seldom remember that this is not what Sir Syed founded AMU for. He wanted its students to be beacons of hope and bearers of a torch. The torch to light the path to tolerance, enlightenment and rationality.\n\nLet the light also reach the likes of the IAS officer who punished a school teacher for making his students sing Iqbal\u2019s uplifting poem Lab pe aati hai dua\u2026(the prayer comes to our lips). Let the light also shine on the minister who wrongly justified punitive action against the teacher and the school for the harmless activity. Let the light of education reach every dark corner. Let the virtues Sir Syed epitomized be omnipresent.\n\nJo abr yahan se uthega woh sare jahn pe barse ga (The cloud that will rise from here will bring rains everywhere)", "description": "Respected Sir Syed, As we celebrate your 202th birth anniversary on October 17\u2014we call it Sir Syed Day\u2014I want to talk to you.
