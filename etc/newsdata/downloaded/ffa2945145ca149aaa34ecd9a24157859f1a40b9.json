Cory Booker\u2019s (D-NJ) campaign made it plain and simple on Saturday: if they don\u2019t raise another $1.7 million by September 30, they don\u2019t see a \u201clegitimate long-term path forward,\u201d to compete for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nBooker\u2019s campaign manager Addisu Demissie wrote in a memo on Saturday morning, first reported by NBC News, that \u201c Without a fundraising surge to close out this quarter, we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been in this to raise his profile or to sell books. He is in it to win it,\u201d Demissie wrote. \u201cThe next ten days will decide whether or not he can.\u201d\n\nWith the Democratic National Committee set to raise thresholds further for qualifying for future debates, Demissie surmised that the New Jersey Democrat is not alone in his financial insecurity. In fact, he alluded to \u201conly four campaigns in this race,\u201d with the money and resources necessary to compete for the nomination in the long haul. Those would be the campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBooker has long drawn plaudits from voters and activists for his enthusiastic speeches and debate performances, but hasn\u2019t managed to break out in polling in the incredibly crowded field. Demissie said, without revealing specific financial numbers, that they are in a position to continue competing, but without more money to expand their operation, they don\u2019t see a path to winning the nomination.\n\n\u201cCory got in this race to win it and to beat Donald Trump,\u201d Demissie wrote. \u201cWith four and a half months until voting begins, he is well-positioned to do just that\u2014if he has the resources to support and grow our team. But if our campaign is not in a financial position to grow, he\u2019s not going to continue to consume resources and attention that can be used to focus on beating Donald Trump, which needs to be everyone\u2019s first priority in this election.\u201d\n\nOn a subsequent call with reporters, Demissie addressed the fact that the current top four were all white candidates in the most historically diverse presidential field in history.\n\n\u201cWe have the most diverse Democratic field in history and I think it would be a shame if that diversity was not reflected in the candidates who end up competing for the nomination once people actually start voting come next spring,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd I do think that there are some candidates in this race that should think seriously about their standing in it and what exactly their goals are. But I\u2019m focused on what we need to do to win. We are still in a position to win. What we need to do is raise money in the next ten days. And that\u2019s what we are going to focus on like a laser.\u201d\n\nWhile the campaign called this a \u201cherculean challenge,\u201d they also noted that they had raised $1.4 million in the final ten days of March to close out the first quarter. Now they\u2019ll have to do that and then some to survive.", "description": "In a memo and call with reporters on Saturday, the senator\u2019s campaign manager said the campaign needs to raise $1.7 million by the end of the month.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1427,w_2538,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569080652/booker_fundraising_concerns_oaofon", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
