(Jacob Kupferman/Getty)\n\nAlready ruled out for Week 4, Cam Newton could be sidelined for much longer than that thanks to a foot injury.\n\nAccording to The Athletic\u2019s Joseph Person, Cam Newton is dealing with a Lisfranc injury that will keep him out indefinitely.\n\nThough multiple sources told Person that surgery isn\u2019t planned for the 30-year-old at this time, the fact that it\u2019s even being discussed is not a good sign for Newton\u2019s prospects for the rest of the season.\n\nWithout surgery, a Lisfranc injury can normally take four-to-eight weeks to heal, so the Panthers will likely be missing Newton for an extended period of time.\n\nThat means the starting quarterback job in Carolina will continue to belong to second-year player Kyle Allen.\n\nAn undrafted player out of the University of Houston, Allen looked very impressive while leading the Panthers to the team\u2019s first victory of the season on Sunday in Arizona.\n\nEven though Allen finished with a 144.4 QB rating (the second-best mark in franchise history) on Sunday and is 2-0 as a starter for the Panthers (Newton has lost eight straight), Panthers coach Ron Rivera said there will not be a quarterback controversy in Carolina when Newton is ready to take the field.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our quarterback and he\u2019s who we rely on,\u201d Rivera said of Newton.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if he\u2019s singing a different tune a month from now if the team keeps winning with 23-year-old Allen under center and Newton, whose current deal up after the 2020 season, is still out.", "description": "According to The Athletic's Joseph Person, Newton is dealing with a Lisfranc injury that will keep him out indefinitely and allow Kyle Allen to start.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174348007-e1569337807589.jpg?fit=816%2C545", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
