That was the whole appeal of the show to begin with! According to Deadline, the network that brought you brooding, horny Riverdale and an upcoming Nancy Drew series that demonstrated considerable levels of horniness in a pilot preview, is now developing a \u201cgothic horror drama\u201d reboot of the \u201860s soap opera. Dark Shadows: Reincarnation will be penned by Revenge writer Mark B. Perry, and honestly that show was pretty horny, too.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t seen the occult cult hit, this show had everything: the extremely cursed, rich Collins family; a new governess getting too close to a hidden secret, vampires, murder, and Maine. (All of these elements will reportedly be resurrected in the update!) For those who don\u2019t know Dark Shadows, maybe don\u2019t give it a Goog. There\u2019s a 2012 movie version that will drive you to the brink of madness, and that\u2019s just Johnny Depp\u2019s wig.", "description": "The CW developing cult 1960s soap opera Dark Shadows into Dark Shadows: Reincarnation reboot, in the vein of Riverdale.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/9-Dark-Shadows-Reboot.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
