It's difficult to imagine Brexit not appearing, in some form, on the runway.\n\nEnvironmental protest is all but guaranteed, too. The climate campaign group Extinction Rebellion has called for the total cancellation of London Fashion Week, describing it in a statement as a \"parade of excess\" that promotes destructive over-consumption. The group has pledged to stage \"disruptive events,\" throughout the event's five days, culminating in a mock funeral to \"put (London Fashion Week) to rest forevermore.\"\n\nLondon isn't the only city of the \"big four\" fashion weeks facing controversy ahead of the September schedules. Labels Prabal Gurung and Rag & Bone have both canceled shows at New York Fashion Week (NYFW) over links between venue The Shed, in Hudson Yards, and billionaire Trump fundraiser Stephen Ross.\n\nAnd all this during a year in which major fashion houses have faced accusations of racism, cultural appropriation and using offensive imagery -- from a Gucci sweater resembling blackface to a Burberry \"noose\" hoodie criticized both for its connotations of racist lynching and for glamorizing suicide.\n\nFashion weeks have never been apolitical. Recent decades offer countless examples of designers using runways to stage protests and challenge the status quo. But in what feels like an exceptionally divisive time for the industry and politics at large, could this be the most controversial fashion month yet?\n\nPoliticized runways\n\nMuch like art, fashion is influenced by -- and responds to -- the politics of the day.\n\nAs such, protests have always been a part of Fashion Weeks, from Katharine Hamnett meeting British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984 in a shirt reading \"58% don't want Pershing\" (a reference to a public poll on nuclear missiles) to Vivienne Westwood models wearing \"Yes\" badges at her SS15 London show in support of Scottish independence.\n\nKatharine Hamnett meets former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street in an anti-nuclear missiles protest T-shirt Credit: PA Images/Getty Images\n\nPoliticized runways carry certain risks, however. Take Karl Lagerfeld's SS15 Chanel show in Paris, which featured Kendall Jenner carrying a sign reading, \"Women's rights are more than alright,\" and Cara Delevingne lead feminist chants through a megaphone. Critics weren't convinced, pointing to Lagerfeld's long history of making disparaging comments about women.\n\n\"Runway shows are marketing exercises,\" said head of fashion at Dazed Digital, Emma Hope Allwood, over email. \"And while it can be great if designers choose to use that media attention for good, when brands jump on social causes it can feel profit driven and insincere. It's a fine line.\"\n\nRecent editions of NYFW have been especially charged. Last year, Prabal Gurung brought the #MeToo movement to the runway when models carried white roses, a symbol of the movement. And in Pyer Moss' SS19 show , clothes featured slogans like \"Stop Calling 911 On The Culture,\" a reference to recent incidents of white people calling the police on black people for completely innocuous activities like sleeping in a college common room or waiting in Starbucks\n\nModels walk the runway for the Pyer Moss SS2019 show at New York Fashion Week.

And Trump's administration has been a fashion week talking point beyond the US -- at Missoni's Milan show in February 2017, models wore so-called \"pussyhats\" -- pink knitted hats designed in response to the president's comments about women.\n\nCapturing the zeitgeist\n\nBrexit has also been a talking point in previous editions of London Fashion Week. The British Fashion Council (BFC), which organizes London Fashion Week, has been vocal in its opposition to a no-deal Brexit, which it estimates could cost the fashion industry up to \u00a3900 million ($1.09 billion). A BFC survey held before the 2016 referendum found that 90% of British fashion designers supported remaining in the EU.\n\nDesigners have, unsurprisingly, already responded to the referendum result on the runway.\n\nTake British designer Jenny Packham, who told Vogue that she was reexamining \"what it means to be British\" at NYFW in 2016 through biker jackets, tartan, pearls and punk. Or Ashish Gupta's SS17 show at London Fashion Week, which took the opportunity to celebrate Britain's diversity by drawing heavily on Indian garments, fabrics and jewelry.\n\n\"I was absolutely horrified by Brexit,\" Gupta told Refinery29 at the time. \"It broke my heart. I just wanted to make a statement about it and celebrate this culture which is so beautiful and an integral part of life in this country.\"\n\nAshish's SS17 at London Fashion Week incorporated Indian design.

Beyond the aforementioned scandals, the past year has also seen a $790 Gucci turban that angered Sikh groups , Prada merchandise that resembled racist blackface imagery and a D&G ad that was criticized for its stereotyped portrayal of a Chinese model eating Italian food with chopsticks.\n\nA number of legacy fashion houses have since appointed new councils and executives to champion diversity and equity. And Fashion Month observers will be watching closely to see what lessons -- if any -- labels have learned from the outrage caused.\n\nGarelick expressed doubt that the root causes of high-profile fashion gaffes have been tidily resolved. \"My real concern is that these fashion moments reveal the terrible rise in racism, nationalism, white supremacy and other noxious movements that are increasing globally,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile McCall believes that diversity appointments at brands like Prada and Gucci's were made too recently to affect this season's runways.\n\n\"My understanding of those roles is that they're meant to impact internal structures and company cultures,\" she explained in a phone interview, adding: \"Of course, as you change a company's culture to become more naturally inclusive, I believe that does reflect in matters like casting choices. But that may take some time.\"\n\nYet, recent fashion months have seen a wide range of labels pushing for greater diversity on the runway, by rejecting the overwhelmingly white, cisgender, slim, ableist ideal the industry has long promoted. Through their casting choices and other creative decisions, designers have made potent statements about who fashion belongs to -- and who it has repeatedly excluded.\n\nKid Cudi walked in Louis Vuitton's menswear SS19 show, at Paris Fashion Week.
