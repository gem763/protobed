Despite being refused permission to visit Kashmir, he went to India and met officials and key members of civil society in Delhi on Thursday and Friday.\n\nSpeaking to media persons in New Delhi, he said, \u201cI wanted to visit Kashmir to see first-hand what was happening, but was not allowed by the Indian government. We had approached the government about a week ago, but were told it was not the right time to go there.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen, who has travelled across India but never been to occupied Kashmir, said, \u201cI had thought it would be useful to go there and see the situation myself. My personal view is that if you have nothing to hide, there is nothing to fear by allowing visitors to the territory. I can only conclude that the Indian government doesn\u2019t want us to see what\u2019s happening out there.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Chris Van Hollen wanted to visit occupied Kashmir to see the situation first-hand but the Indian government denied him permission to go there.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lead_720_405.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
