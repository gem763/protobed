He signed it anyway!\u201d Trump wrote in a pair of tweets. \u201cIf the Supreme Court upholds DACA, it gives the President extraordinary powers, far greater than ever thought.\n\n\u201cIf they do what is right and do not let DACA stand, with all of its negative legal implications, the Republicans and Democrats will have a DEAL to let them stay in our Country, in very short order. It would actually benefit DACA, and be done the right way!\u201d Trump added.\n\nTrump was apparently referring to former president Barack Obama\u2019s remark in 2011 regarding immigration policy.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said. at the time. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remind everybody that, what I\u2019ve said previously, I am not a king, I am head of the executive branch of government. I am required to follow the law, and that is what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThe next year, however, Obama implemented DACA by executive order after failing to persuade Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would have given migrants the same benefits provided by DACA but on a gradual basis.", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday called on the Supreme Court to cancel the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
