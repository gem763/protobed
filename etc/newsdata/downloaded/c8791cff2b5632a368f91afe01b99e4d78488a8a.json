The Trump administration also imposed sanctions on dozens of individuals and entities allegedly involved with terror groups.\n\nTreasury and the U.S. State Department have blacklisted about 400 people and entities under antiterror authorities over the past two years, representing nearly one-third of all such designations since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Those figures underscore the Trump administration\u2019s focus on sanctions as a primary foreign-policy tool across the geopolitical spectrum.\n\nWith the newly updated executive order, the U.S. can now impose secondary sanctions for any person, business or financial institution found to have handled transactions with all individuals and entities designated as terrorists by the U.S., Ms. Mandelker said in the speech.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nForeign financial institutions at risk of such secondary sanctions include money services businesses, cryptocurrency exchangers and administrators, in addition to banks, she said. The action could cut off their access to the world\u2019s biggest economy and most-used currency critical to most of the world\u2019s trade and finance.\n\nThe executive order also expanded the U.S. government\u2019s ability to swiftly target alleged leaders and officials of terrorist groups and those participating in terror training over the internet and other telecommunications platform, in addition to those participating in terror training camps, she said.\n\nUnder the new rules, the two departments responsible for imposing sanctions no longer need to develop detailed dossiers tying top officials or agents involved in terror groups to specific attacks or acts, said Nathan Sales, the State Department\u2019s top counterterror official.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re out in the dark corners of the internet getting bomb-making instructions, if you\u2019re going to a Hezbollah training camp, that fact alone is now a sufficient basis for you to be designated under our sanctions authorities,\u201d he said, referring to the Iran-backed Lebanese group designated by the U.S. as a terror organization.\n\nEric Lorber, a former top Treasury sanctions official, said the new powers are a significant change from past authorities not only in making it easier to issue terror sanctions, but also because now any financial institution found handling transactions for entities blacklisted as terrorists or their supporters is at risk being cut out of the U.S. financial system.\n\n\u201cThis is a real expansion of authority,\u201d said Mr. Lorber, now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. \u201cWhile most financial institutions would not have done business with designated terrorists even before this new authority, this action makes clear that the U.S. Treasury is willing to take serious steps to punish those financial institutions that do.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com and Ian Talley at ian.talley@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. plans to use expanded counterterrorism powers to target foreign financial institutions that facilitate terrorist financing, leaders of terrorist groups and those participating in terrorist training over the internet, a senior U.S. Treasury Department official said.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun", "Ian Talley", "Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com", "Ian.Talley Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106442/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
