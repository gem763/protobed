True to form, he\u2019s repeatedly declared that he\u2019s deserving of the prestigious honor, and has claimed the Nobel committee\u2014a five person panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament\u2014is rigged against him.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things\u2014if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this year.\n\nTrump has now been in office for nearly three years, and still has yet to receive the prize, while former President Barack Obama won it within nine months of taking office. This year\u2019s winner will be announced at 11 a.m. Friday at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, and streamed live on their website at 5 a.m. EST.\n\nTrump has argued that he deserves the prize for his efforts to open communication with North Korea and denuclearize the hermit nation, a commendable goal that has so far been unsuccessful despite multiple summits with the North Korean leader.\n\nWhile he\u2019s insisted \u201cthey probably will never give\u201d the award to him, Trump has been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is rumored to have sent the Nobel Committee a sparkling nomination letter on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cWe have nominated him of course for the positive developments on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Per-Willy Amundsen, a former right-wing Norweigian Justice Minister told Reuters in February. \u201cIt has been a very difficult situation and the tensions have since lowered and a lot of it is due to Trump\u2019s unconventional diplomatic style.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s dogged pursuit of things with his name on them, the Nobel Peace Prize would provide him with abiding bragging rights. Past winners, however, may not welcome him with open arms. Since entering the White House, the world\u2019s greatest peace-makers have often found discord with the leader of the free world.\n\nMalala Yousafzai\n\nYousafzai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, has been a frequent critic of President Trump\u2019s policies. She first gained international attention after being shot in the head for going to school in her native Pakistan, defying a Taliban ban on girls receiving education. Yousafzai miraculously survived and used her recognition to advocate for women\u2019s rights around the world.\n\nAs a champion for gender equality, Yousafzai was first asked about Trump in reaction to the allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against the president. She told a crowd at the World Economic Forum last year that she was \u201cso disappointed to see that people in high positions talk about women in unequal terms and do not accept them as equals,\u201d adding that \u201cit is just shocking for a second to believe that this is actually happening\u2026 I hope that women stand up and speak out against it.\u201d\n\nYousafzai has also addressed the president\u2019s travel ban on Muslim majority countries, as well as his policies at the Mexican border. \u201cI was deeply hurt,\u201d Yousafzai said of the travel ban in 2017. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a Muslim, and to me it just seemed like directly blaming Muslims, and that is not a solution, that is just making an excuse and hiding from the real problems.\u201d\n\nA year later, she spoke out against the Trump administration\u2019s child-separation policy. \u201cThis is cruel, this is unfair and this is inhumane. I don\u2019t know how anyone could do that,\u201d Yousafzai said during a visit to South America. \u201cI hope that the children can be together with their parents.\u201d\n\nNadia Murad\n\nTrump has actually met the most recent Nobel Peace Prize recipient.\n\nDuring a meeting with survivors of religious persecution at the White House in July, Trump listened to Nadia Murad recall how her family was murdered by ISIS, and how she was taken captive by the group. After her escape, she has tirelessly spread the word about the horrific crimes committed against her people by ISIS.\n\nDespite claiming to have defeated ISIS, Trump appeared to be unfamiliar with Murad\u2019s story, asking her why she was awarded the Nobel Prize that he covets. \u201cThey gave it to you for what reason?\u201d Trump asked Murad. \u201cFor what reason?\u201d she responded, appearing confused. \u201cFor that after all this happen to me, I can\u2014I make it clear to everyone that ISIS raped thousands of Yazidi women.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama\n\nThe former president won the Nobel Prize in 2009 for his \u201cextraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between people.\u201d Since leaving office, Obama has largely stayed out of the limelight, occasionally resurfacing to condemn comments or policies by Trump.\n\nDuring a particularly fiery speech in September last year ahead of the primary elections, Obama spoke to the racist divides in America that his successor has reignited. \u201cOver the past few decades the politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to stand up to discrimination. And we\u2019re sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be?\u201d\n\nObama then called out Trump by name. \u201cIt did not start with Donald Trump, he is a symptom not the cause\u2026 he\u2019s just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years.\u201d\n\nJuan Manuel Santos\n\nJuan Manuel Santos, the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize recipient and former president of Colombia, has been diplomatic in his statements regarding President Trump. Santos won the award for orchestrating a historic peace agreement in his country with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\u2014People\u2019s Army, a violent rebel group that generated decades of conflict in Colombia.\n\nSantos, who has experience dealing with dangerous adversaries, acknowledged that Trump has used \u201cbold moves\u201d to establish personal relationships with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important. Leaders are human beings and if they have good chemistry, and some kind of empathy, that makes negotiations much easier.\u201d But said he believes that \u201cmuch more can and should happen.\u201d \u201cSo far, superficial messages have been sent to the world but real progress, one doesn\u2019t see it,\u201d Santos said of Trump. \u201cWe need to see more complete progress.\u201d\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter, who won the prize in 2002 for his lifelong commitment to humanitarian causes, has also acknowledged Trump\u2019s work to bring peace to the Korean peninsula.\n\n\u201cIf President Trump is successful in getting a peace treaty that\u2019s acceptable to both sides with North Korea, I think he certainly ought to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d the former president told Politico last year. \u201cI think it would be a worthy and a momentous accomplishment that no previous president has been able to realize.\u201d\n\nCarter is not withholding in his criticism of Trump, and couched his tentative praise by noting that Trump has already dealt \u201ca damaging blow\u201d to world peace by moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and generally failing to inspire morality in his leadership.\n\nWhen a president does not embody the ideals of a moral leader, \u201cit makes us much more likely to treat people differently, and to discriminate against either African-Americans or others who are different\u2026 I think it\u2019s probably more difficult to elevate human rights to a top priority, and things like peace and justice,\u201d Carter said.\n\nDavid Trimble\n\nDavid Trimble, the former first minister of Northern Ireland who played a major role in negotiating the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the region, and won him the Nobel Peace Prize that same year, has offered a matter-of-fact take on Trump\u2019s potential win.\n\n\u201cTrump is going to do what he wants to do and what he thinks is best. And the Norwegian Nobel Committee acts on the basis of the nominations it receives. Some who deserve it never win,\u201d Trimble said. \u201c... It\u2019s important to remember that (with regards to North Korea) it is not just a matter of saying nice things but applying pressure. And it is better if it\u2019s done in a way that does as little damage as possible.\u201d", "description": "Trump desperately wants the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014but former winners have decidedly mixed feelings about sharing the honor with the commander in chief.", "authors": ["Audrey Mcnamara"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2531,w_4500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570733692/GettyImages-1024541712_klrxas", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
