(Steelers general manager) Kevin Colbert wanted more but really didn't want to trade him at all. He basically went on and took the third- and fifth-round (picks) from the Raiders.\"\n\nAntonio Brown sought advice from social media consultants on how he could accelerate his release from the Raiders, accoring to @mortreport. pic.twitter.com/lXBQmxOB4Z \u2014 NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) September 8, 2019\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter also reported Sunday the Patriots tried to trade for Brown before he was dealt to the Oakland Raiders, but the Steelers didn't want to trade him to a rival.\n\nIt's understandable for the Steelers to be against trading Brown to the Patriots. The Patriots are 8-3 versus the Steelers, including a 3-0 record in the playoffs, when Tom Brady starts at quarterback. It's hard enough to beat the Patriots without Brown, but with the All-Pro wideout now in the fold, New England's offense should be the toughest to defend in the league.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, teams should seriously consider the best trade package available regardless of which rival is offering it, and a first-round pick is a huge asset, even if it's the 32nd overall selection. The Steelers have a lot of roster needs to address, and the draft is the best place to acquire young, cost-controlled talent.\n\nThe situation ultimately worked out for the Patriots, who got to keep their draft picks and still sign Brown before the 2019 season -- although he cannot make his debut for New England until its Week 2 matchup with the Miami Dolphins.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
