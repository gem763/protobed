(AP) \u2014 The Latest on the shooting at a Kansas City, Kansas, bar that left four dead and five wounded (all times local):\n\n1 p.m.\n\nA suspect in a weekend Kansas bar shooting that left four dead and five wounded was given probation last year for trafficking contraband while imprisoned for aggravated robbery instead of more time behind bars.\n\nThe Kansas City Star reports that the same Leavenworth County, Kansas, judge that allowed Hugo Villanueva-Morales to avoid prison in the case also made news earlier this year when he reduced the sentence of a convicted sex offender because he said the 13- and 14-year-old girls who were victims in the abuse were actually \"aggressors.\"\n\nPolice continue searching for Villanueva-Morales. He and 23-year-old Javier Alatorre are charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Sunday's shooting at the Tequila KC bar in Kansas City, Kansas. Alatorre was arrested hours after the shooting in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n___\n\n6:40 a.m.\n\nThe hunt continues for a second suspect in a weekend Kansas bar shooting that left four dead and five wounded after officers searched two homes in the area without finding the fugitive.\n\nThe Kansas City Star reports that police looked Tuesday for 29-year-old Hugo Villanueva-Morales first at a duplex that's less than 1 mile (1.61 kilometer) away from the Tequila KC bar.\n\nGunfire erupted at the bar early Sunday about two hours after Villanueva-Morales got into an argument and was forced to leave. Police Officer Jonathon Westbrook says police also searched a second home before determining Villanueva-Morales wasn't there.\n\nVillanueva-Morales and 23-year-old Javier Alatorre are charged with four counts of first-degree murder.
