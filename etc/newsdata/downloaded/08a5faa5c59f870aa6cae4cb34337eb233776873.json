And the brand, which is indeed based in the city\u2019s Brooklyn borough, has now released a limited-edition bourbon, aptly called The Vaults.\n\nTo be clear, Widow Jane sources the whiskey used in The Vaults, aged for at least 14 years, from out-of-state \u2014 specifically, Tennessee and Indiana (bourbon can indeed be made anywhere in the U.S.). But it adds water from an upstate New York source \u2014 specifically, Rosendale, N.Y. \u2014 to the mix.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Going beyond bourbon: You can now buy \u2018mixing water\u2019 from Kentucky\n\n\u201cThis is the New York fingerprint,\u201d says Lisa Wicker, Widow Jane president and head distiller. She notes that the water is rich in limestone, which is a hallmark of bourbon from Kentucky, so why not see how the New York version compares?\n\n\u201cWe thought, \u2018We have that water in New York and we all know New York water makes great bagels and pizza,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\nOn top of that, Widow Jane finishes aging the whiskey in Brooklyn \u2014 in the case of The Vaults, using American oak casks that have been air-seasoned for eight years. The long period of seasoning adds a \u201cdistinguished\u201d quality to the whiskey, Wicker says.\n\nWidow Jane, which also offers some lower-priced bourbons and ryes, must be doing something right. The company says its sales increased by 42% in 2018.\n\nWhat we think about it: This is indeed a rich, heavy bourbon, something that all but demands to be sipped with consideration. The brand says you should pick up notes of tobacco and brown sugar, among other flavors. But we also detect a buttery quality. In the end, we can\u2019t really say if the water is what\u2019s adding to the whiskey\u2019s sumptuous quality. But we do like a good New York bagel, so who knows?\n\nHow to enjoy it: This is too fancy a bourbon to mix in a cocktail. The brand suggests simply enjoying it neat.", "description": "The Widow Jane brand gives whiskey a Brooklyn pedigree.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT612_widow__ZG_20191018101134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
