Brown has denied the allegations by his former trainer.\n\nTaylor said Tuesday in a statement she will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies.\n\nDarren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, said Brown and Taylor had \u201ca consensual personal relationship.\u201d He told the AP on Tuesday his client plans to countersue.\n\nThe Boston Globe first reported the meeting.\n\nBrown is eligible to play during Sunday\u2019s game at Miami because he was not placed on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list. No criminal charges have been filed and the NFL hasn\u2019t fully developed its investigation, so Brown is able to suit up for the Patriots, who acquired him after Brown requested and got his release from Oakland.\n\nPlayers on the exempt list can\u2019t play in games or practice with a team but are still paid. A player can be placed on the exempt list at any point.\n\nThe AP does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly. Taylor was identified in the federal lawsuit and was quoted in a statement provided by her lawyer, David Haas.\n\n\u201cAs a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault. Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NFL plans to meet Monday with a woman who says she was raped by New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/patriots_antonio_brown_lawsuit_football_18647_c0-189-4500-2812_s1770x1032.jpg?33271a9210e0d700b8e28e38f38178c03fe32ed4", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
