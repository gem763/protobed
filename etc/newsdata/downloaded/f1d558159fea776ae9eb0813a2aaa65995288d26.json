The new policy statement said \u201cchoppy\u201d consumer spending will be supported by \u201csolid income growth,\u201d while lower mortgage rates are driving a rebound in housing.\n\nBut policy makers seem wary that the country\u2019s run of relatively good fortune will last for much longer.\n\nGoverning Council is mindful that the resilience of Canada\u2019s economy will be increasingly tested as trade conflicts and uncertainty persist Bank of Canada\n\nThey cut their outlook for global economic growth in 2019 to 2.9 per cent, the weakest since the financial crisis, and said Canada\u2019s gross domestic product will expand only 1.6 per cent next year, compared with a previous estimate of two per cent.\n\nThat rate of growth would be slower than the central bank\u2019s estimate of how fast the economy can expand without triggering inflation (1.7 per cent), suggesting Governor Stephen Poloz and the rest of his policy committee could feel compelled to cut interest rates in order to resist disinflationary pressures. The Bank of Canada sees exports and investment contracting temporarily in the near term due to weaker demand, uncertainty and the transportation constraints that continue to limit shipments of Alberta oil.\n\n\u201cGoverning Council is mindful that the resilience of Canada\u2019s economy will be increasingly tested as trade conflicts and uncertainty persist,\u201d the Bank of Canada said in the statement.\n\nAn interest-rate cut at the central bank\u2019s next policy meeting in December or early next year would meet the expectations of many on Bay Street. More than 30 central banks have eased monetary policy this summer and most analysts think it is only a matter of time before Canada follows.\n\nThe elephant in the room is the divergence of the Bank of Canada and the rest of the world Thorsten Koeppl, an economics professor at Queen\u2019s University\n\n\u201cDomestically, everything looks super good,\u201d Thorsten Koeppl, an economics professor at Queen\u2019s University, told me in an interview. \u201cThe elephant in the room is the divergence of the Bank of Canada and the rest of the world,\u201d he added. \u201cYou see what other central banks are doing. That\u2019s a signal.\u201d\n\nInvestors will take note of the Bank of Canada\u2019s mention of the dollar\u2019s recent strength, which hurts the competitiveness of Canadian exporters that the central bank routinely characterizes as relatively uncompetitive. Policy makers aren\u2019t guided by a particular exchange rate, but they know that a stronger dollar will crimp exports, which would slow economic growth and put downward pressure on inflation.\n\n\u201cCommodity prices have fallen amid concerns about global demand,\u201d the central bank said. \u201cDespite this, the Canada-U.S. exchange rate is still near its July level, and the Canadian dollar has strengthened against other currencies.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, an interest-cut isn\u2019t a sure thing. The central bank is wary of re-igniting the household debt binge that emerged as a significant threat in recent years. For now, policy makers think Canadians will use their higher wages to pay off some of that debt, but acknowledge that lower borrowing costs could trigger the opposite.\n\nFiscal policy also could end up doing some of the work of offsetting weaker global growth, if politicians make good on some of their election promises.\n\n\u201cIn considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, the bank will be monitoring the extent to which the global slowdown spreads beyond manufacturing and investment,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt will pay close attention to the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy \u2014 notably consumer spending and housing activity \u2014 as well as to fiscal policy developments.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin", "description": "Kevin Carmichael: Policy makers seem wary that country\u2019s run of relatively good fortune will last for much longer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/stephen-poloz2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
