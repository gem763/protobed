I always feel wherever I am on this continent that the community around me provides a life that is enriching and is rooted in the simplest things - connection, connection with others and the natural environment.\"\n\nPrince Harry said he wanted to teach his son Archie the lessons he had learned from Africa about \"the value of the natural world\" and \"community and friendship\".\n\n'Stinging attack'\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and Guardian columnist Roy Greenslade said the duchess might win the legal action, but he said Prince Harry had taken a risk by attacking the press for the actions of one newspaper.\n\n\"The press - particularly the tabloid press - is far less powerful now than it was during his mother's era,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"Is he taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut here? I think he may well find that this is counter-productive.\"\n\nBBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the prince's statement about the press was \"remarkably outspoken\" and \"nothing less than a stinging attack on the British tabloid media\".\n\nThe language is clearly Harry's: an unrestrained expression of anger and pain aimed at the British tabloid media.\n\nDid any of his advisers urge restraint? We simply don't know. Judging by the length and intensity of the statement, Harry would have been in no mood to listen to any such cautionary advice.\n\nIs it fair to castigate the entire British tabloid media off the back of one dispute with one newspaper over one story, however painful? That is a matter of individual opinion and clearly Harry - supported one assumes by Meghan - believes that it is.\n\nThe timing certainly is curious. They are concluding a visit to Southern Africa which by wide consent (much of it expressed in the tabloid media) has been a considerable success. It has lifted their reputation after a series of mis-steps involving private jets and expensive property renovations.\n\nNow they have chosen to take one of the most powerful newspaper groups in Britain to court and launched this stinging assault on an entire section of the British media.\n\nBritish tabloids are not afraid of a fight. They may well feel provoked by the language in this statement. Was it wise? We shall see.\n\nIt is not the first time members of the royal family have taken legal action against the press.\n\nIn 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were awarded \u00a392,000 (100,000 euros) in damages after French magazine Closer printed topless pictures of the duchess.\n\nA French court ruled the images had been an invasion of the couple's privacy.\n\nIf the case did reach the court, Prince Harry and Meghan might have to appear to give evidence, said media law expert David Banks.\n\nHe added that one of the drawbacks of of launching a privacy action meant that Meghan could face a \"very uncomfortable\" public exploration of her relationship with her father.\n\n'Lie after lie'\n\nThe new legal proceedings are being funded privately by the couple and any proceeds will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.\n\nIn his statement, Prince Harry said he and Meghan believed in \"media freedom and objective, truthful reporting\" as a \"cornerstone of democracy\".\n\nBut he said his wife had become \"one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Earlier on in their tour of Africa, the couple introduced baby son Archie to Archbishop Desmond Tutu\n\nPrince Harry said: \"There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face - as so many of you can relate to - I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.\"\n\n\"They have been able to create lie after lie at her expense simply because she has not been visible while on maternity leave,\" he said.\n\n\"She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you've seen on this Africa tour.\"\n\n'It is bullying'\n\nThe duke said he had been a \"silent witness to her private suffering for too long\".\n\nHe accused the paper of misleading readers when it published the private letter, by strategically omitting paragraphs, sentences and specific words \"to mask the lies they had perpetrated for over a year\".\n\n\"Put simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn't acceptable, at any level,\" he said.\n\n\"We won't and can't believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\"\n\nThe Mail on Sunday spokesperson said: \"We categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\"", "description": "The Mail on Sunday denies it \"unlawfully\" published the Duchess of Sussex's private letter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12BC9/production/_109054767_reuterstobymelville.jpg"}
