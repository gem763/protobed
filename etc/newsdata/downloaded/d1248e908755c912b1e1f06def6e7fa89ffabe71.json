Shortly after, the Deep Stater contacted a House Intelligence Committee aide to discuss the Trump-Zelensky call in which the world leaders discussed U.S. military aid and the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House candidate Joe Biden. The panel staffer shared several of the officer\u2019s claims, which are based on secondhand information, with Schiff, but did not reveal his identity.\n\nHowever, appearing September 17th on MSNBC, Schiff told contributor Sam Stein, \u201cwe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to,\u201d Schiff told Stein when asked if he was in touch with the officer. \u201cBut I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\u201d\n\nContrary to Schiff\u2019s claims, the Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler branded the California Democrat\u2019s answer as \u201cflat-out false.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe now says he\u2019s was answering the wrong question, but if that was the case, he should have quickly corrected the record. He compounded his falsehood by telling reporters a few days later that if not for the [intelligence community inspector general\u2019s] office, the committee would not have known about the complaint. That again suggested there had been no prior communication,\u201d wrote Kessler.\n\n\u201cThe explanation that Schiff was not sure it was the same whistleblower especially strains credulity,\u201d the fact-checker went on. \u201cSchiff earns Four Pinocchios.\u201d\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence panel conceded the lawmaker \u201cshould have been more carefully phrased\u201d in his response to the MSNBC contributor.\n\n\u201cRegarding Chairman Schiff\u2019s comments on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 in the context, he intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not,\u201d said the press representative. \u201cAs he said in his answer, the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the acting [director of national intelligence] as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\u201d\n\nKessler regularly grades statements by lawmakers, which in his column, range from one to four Pinocchios\u2014with one Pinocchio counting as a minor offense to four being a certifiable falsehood.", "description": "\"The explanation that Adam Schiff was not sure it was the same whistleblower especially strains credulity,\" the fact-checker wrote.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178987664-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
