Jonathan Atkins/Handout via REUTERS/Files\n\nTrading in the now 3 billion pound fund managed by Woodford, one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile money managers, was suspended four months ago after poor performance led to an increase in demand from clients to take their money back.\n\nAt the heart of Woodford\u2019s troubles was the scale of his holdings in unlisted or illiquid assets, which have become a focal point for the UK markets regulator in subsequent weeks - especially as Woodford continued to charge investors management fees.\n\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that the closure should act as a reminder of the structural problems in open-ended investment funds like Woodford\u2019s, which allow investors to take their money out any day they like.\n\nThe BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority will spell out how investors can pull cash from open-ended funds in December, following a review.\n\nDespite Woodford trying to sell its illiquid holdings ahead of a planned December fund reopening, administrator Link Fund Solutions (LFS) told investors the process had not gone as planned.\n\nAs such, Link said the fund risked an extended suspension in December, potentially leading to unequal treatment of investors.\n\n\u201cWhilst progress has been made in relation to repositioning the Fund\u2019s assets, this has unfortunately not been sufficient to allow reasonable certainty as to when the repositioning would be fully achieved and the Fund could be re-opened,\u201d Link said.\n\nNeil Woodford, in a separate statement, firmly rejected the move to shut the fund and oust him as manager.\n\n\u201cThis was Link\u2019s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.\u201d\n\nA source close to Woodford told Reuters that Link\u2019s decision was a \u201ccomplete surprise\u201d and the manager had only learnt of Link\u2019s intention to close the fund late on Monday.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority said it \u201cwelcomed the removal of uncertainty\u201d provided by Link\u2019s decision to shut the fund.\n\nIt \u201cmeans investors should receive some of their money back sooner than had the fund remained suspended for a longer period,\u201d the regulator said.\n\nWoodford will cease to be the fund\u2019s investment manager with immediate effect and its assets will be split into two portfolios, LFS said in a statement.\n\nBlackRock Advisors (BLK.N) will take charge of selling the fund\u2019s listed assets while PJT Partners will continue with its previously agreed role in helping to sell the fund\u2019s illiquid assets, Link said. PJT declined to comment.\n\nThe winding up of the LF Woodford Equity Income Fund - which will be stripped of Woodford\u2019s name - will begin on Jan. 17, 2020, Link said, when investors should receive an initial payment.\n\nA spokeswoman for BlackRock said it would \u201cseek to maximise value for investors, balancing the need for a timely return of capital with the challenges of the illiquidity profile of the portfolio\u201d.\n\nStocks in the fund, as per the last portfolio data published in April, include housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (TW.L), Barratt Developments (BDEV.L) and subprime lender Provident Financial Group (PFG.L).\n\nFALLEN STAR\n\nDarius McDermott, managing director of financial adviser Chelsea Financial Services, described the situation as \u201ca mess\u201d and the closure of the fund will make it \u201ca forced seller of all stocks\u201d.\n\nOxford-based Woodford made his name at Invesco Perpetual in part after famously avoiding the collapse of the tech bubble at the turn of the century as well as banks ahead of the financial crisis.\n\nAfter more than two decades at Invesco, he set up his own eponymously titled firm in 2014, quickly amassing billions in mostly retail investor assets, much of it from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV.L), which continued to back the troubled fund right up to its suspension.\n\nAt its peak the fund managed more than 10 billion pounds.\n\nShares in Neil Woodford\u2019s separate listed fund Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT) (WPCT.L), which shares some of the same holdings as the suspended fund, slid to a record low and by 1013 GMT were trading down 9.5%.\n\nWealth manager Alan Steel, a long-term Woodford investor, told Reuters he had discussed the potential merits of liquidating the fund with the fund manager at a private meeting \u201cmonths ago\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would have been better than giving up now after all the hassle investors like me, my children and my grandchildren have endured,\u201d Steel said, adding that he had been well rewarded by Woodford\u2019s investment approach over the past 30 years.\n\nNooman Haque, a banker whose family invested 10,000 pounds in the fund, said Woodford\u2019s decision to continue charging fees during the suspension \u201cdid not endear him to investors\u201d.\n\n($1 = 0.7904 pounds)", "description": "Neil Woodford has been ousted from his flagship LF Woodford Equity Income Fund which will be shut down to pay back investors whose money has been trapped since June.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441014296&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0CX", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
