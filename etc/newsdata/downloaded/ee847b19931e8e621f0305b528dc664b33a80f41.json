(AP) - From the Warner Bros. soundstages to a private workout retreat in Las Vegas, LeBron James and Anthony Davis spent a whole lot of their long summer together.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers superstars say they\u2019ve already formed a bond before they hit the court as teammates. That offseason work is the foundation for their efforts to build an immediate contender together with this long-struggling franchise.\n\nWhen the Lakers reported to their training complex Friday, LeBron and AD were the center of attention amid the revamped roster they helped to create. They posed for photos, joked easily with themselves and their teammates, and generally looked like they\u2019ve been together for years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have such a beautiful young mind, a beautiful player, but also a great leader as well,\u201d James said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for this franchise to have such an all-around great person. The basketball will speak for itself.\u201d\n\nAlthough Davis has one year left on his contract before free agency, the Lakers left no doubt they\u2019re planning for a long-term future with the vaunted big man and his decorated new teammate. The Lakers\u2018 roster was thoroughly revamped in the offseason, and general manager Rob Pelinka constantly consulted with James and Davis via three-way phone calls and text chains.\n\n\u201cI think the front office did a great job of including LeBron and myself in the decisions to build this team,\u201d Davis said. \u201cEvery guy that is on this team, me and LeBron had a say-so in, and I think that\u2019s very important. It would be pretty weird to go to war with a guy you don\u2019t really like, so they made sure to include us in every decision.\u201d\n\nThey also defeated the Monstars together, at least presumably: James spent part of his summer starring in \u201cSpace Jam 2\u201d for Warner Bros., and he roped in Davis to play a part in the film coming out next year.\n\nUnlike his media mogul teammate, Davis chuckled and said his role in the sequel is \u201ca one-time thing. That was very time-consuming. At least right now, I don\u2019t see any more movies in my near future, but it was a fun experience.\u201d\n\nJames was the star of that show, but he doesn\u2019t care about being the unquestioned star of the Lakers. In fact, James declared his hope that the Lakers\u2018 offense will run through Davis, who is averaging 23.7 points per game over his seven-year NBA career.\n\n\u201cWe all know how great Anthony Davis is, and if we\u2019re not playing through Anthony Davis, why is he on the floor then?\u201d James asked. \u201cIt makes no sense to have him on the floor, because he\u2019s that great. That doesn\u2019t mean every time down the floor we throw it to him, but we have the ability to do that.\u201d\n\nWhen he wasn\u2019t dunking on cartoons, Davis also played a role in recruiting players to LA and persuading others to stay with the franchise he had just joined. The Lakers added sharpshooting veterans Danny Green, Jared Dudley and Troy Daniels in a bid to get the valuable spacing that will make the superstars more effective.\n\n\u201cI just told guys we definitely have the opportunity to do something special here this year,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAll you can ask for is a chance in this league, and we definitely have a chance to do something special.\u201d\n\nMore things to know from the Lakers\u2018 training complex:\n\nKUZMA\u2019S HEALTH\n\nKyle Kuzma was upbeat despite a stress reaction in his left foot that will sideline him until at least mid-October. The third-year forward has set a goal to become an All-Star as the only remaining member of the Lakers\u2018 young core, which was broken up in the trade for Davis.\n\n\u201cObviously I was disappointed, but it was good that we caught what I have at the right time,\u201d said Kuzma, who felt the injury while training with the U.S. national team.\n\nDWIGHT RETURNS\n\nDwight Howard is back in the Lakers\u2018 jersey for the first time since he left in 2013, the start of six unsatisfying years for the big man and the team he left behind. Howard\u2019s new teammates say he is humbler, more introspective and determined to excel as a role player or something bigger.\n\n\u201cI expect my teammates to hold me to a high standard, because I hole myself to one,\u201d Howard said. \u201cMy job is to be the best Dwight Howard and the best teammate I can be.\u201d\n\nDEMARCUS DOWN\n\nDeMarcus Cousins wasn\u2019t available to reporters, but the big man was in his teammates\u2019 thoughts. Davis is disappointed he probably won\u2019t get a reunion with the star center, who badly injured his knee in an offseason workout shortly after signing with the Lakers.\n\n\u201cI was shocked, just knowing that he worked so hard to try to get back from his quad and his Achilles,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t really had the opportunity to be old DeMarcus, and he wanted this year to be the year, because he felt like he was very healthy, and then the ACL happened. But he\u2019s in good spirits. He\u2019s just happy to be here and still be around the team, and we support him all the way through.\u201d\n\nVOGEL\u2019S START\n\nThe Lakers\u2018 new head coach almost got lost in the shuffle of media day. Frank Vogel and a coaching staff including Jason Kidd and Lionel Hollins will take charge for the Lakers\u2018 opening practice Saturday with the goal of building a cohesive team out of all these new parts.\n\nVogel isn\u2019t giving away a potential starting lineup or rotations just yet, but he is thrilled to take over a team with strong veteran leadership.\n\n\u201cWhen the belief is strong at the outset, then it\u2019s about focusing in on the work, and we\u2019re looking forward to getting after it,\u201d Vogel said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From the Warner Bros. soundstages to a private workout retreat in Las Vegas, LeBron James and Anthony Davis spent a whole lot of their long summer together.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/lakers_media_day_basketball_14535_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
