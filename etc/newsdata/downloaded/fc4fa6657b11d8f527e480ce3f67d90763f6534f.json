He told VICE that the nickname was given to him by an afterschool basketball coach, and it stuck, at the behest of his parents, who wanted their son to assimilate into American culture. For a while, Atsushi said, the nickname didn\u2019t bother him: \u201cIt was more about making sure I fit in to this Western, white society.\u201d But once he entered the professional world and took a step back to consider the way he presented himself, he dropped the name immediately. \u201cThat was when I finally realized people can pronounce my name after a couple tries,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to realize that other people had more respect for their names. They didn\u2019t think they had to make compromises to get people to say their name.\u201d\n\nNicknames can certainly be affectionate. They\u2019re often a signal of familiarity and intimacy, like the exchange of pet names between romantic partners or the joke-y personalized jerseys worn by members of a sports team. When the act of nicknaming doesn\u2019t stem from a close relationship, or the desire to connote closeness, things get trickier. According to people whose names deviate from the American conception of \u2018normal,\u2019 it\u2019s not unusual to get assigned an unwanted, unsolicited nickname from people who are trying to avoid learning to pronounce their real name. But that refusal to learn can leave the nickname recipients feeling alienated, and even downright disrespected.\n\nIf your name is \u201chard\u201d or \u201cweird,\u201d introductions can be fraught. When a new acquaintance asks Ashfia (pronounced Ash-fee-a) if they can call her \u201cAsh,\u201d because it\u2019s \u201ceasier to say,\u201d she questions what gave them the impression that the answer might be yes. \u201cIt kind of makes me doubt my own confidence,\u201d Ashfia told VICE. \u201cI think, \u2018Oh, am I coming across as too nice, or as someone they find they can just...do that with?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen R\u00f3is\u00edn (pronounced Row-sheen) moved to the United States from the United Kingdom for a job (she currently works for i-D in London), she found herself in possession of a new nickname as soon as she started spending time with people in social settings. \u201cWhen I first moved [to New York], I was kind of embarrassed at being different in any way, so I just ran with it and was like, \u2018Haha, yeah, whatever, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m cool!\u2019\u201d she said over Twitter DM. \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna feel like a square or just come across as a dickhead. Now that I\u2019m older, I\u2019m like, \u2018Guys, that\u2019s not how you say my name, please, for the love of God, learn!\u2019\u201d Some of her American acquaintances still call her \u201cRowsh,\u201d which she said she\u2019s grown to like, even if she doesn\u2019t love the logic behind it. \u201cI know it\u2019s because they can\u2019t say R\u00f3is\u00edn and I did not consent to that!!!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also an obvious cultural (and racial) component to name culture. Atsushi said he still hasn\u2019t let all of his college friends know that he prefers to be called by his full name, but that he no longer introduces himself as \u2018Sushi,\u2019 and hopes they\u2019ll take the hint eventually. \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making a big deal out of this, but over time it kind of feels gross,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like calling someone \u2018buddy\u2019 or \u2018little man.\u2019 It\u2019s a little bit belittling of my own identity. And my case is special, because it\u2019s a little bit racist to call a Japanese person \u2018Sushi\u2019\u2026 but it\u2019s still a part of my name, so it\u2019s a gray area. Like, think about what it feels like to be called a food from your own culture.\u201d\n\nThat ambivalence feels relevant, because for immigrants and their children, a name can often feel like a small thing to fight for given the host of other problems they\u2019re likely to face. But since it\u2019s something they have to work around on a daily basis, it doesn\u2019t feel like a small issue, either. Ashfia said the balancing act between the desire to be polite and the desire to be identified correctly is difficult to navigate and can be extremely frustrating, especially as a first-generation Bangladeshi-American with strong ties to her culture. \u201cThere\u2019s two very different scenarios,\u201d she said. \u201cOne scenario where you're asking me how to pronounce my name is giving me control, versus another scenario where you're basically giving me a nickname. [That\u2019s] you taking control of my identity.\u201d\n\nDaily errands like grabbing a cup of coffee or snagging takeout can also come with an extra layer of decision-making for people with unusual names. Do I take the time to make sure Starbucks gets my name right, or do I give out a fake one? Do I correct my substitute teacher, my Uber driver, my friend\u2019s friend from out of town who I\u2019ll probably never see again? All of the people VICE spoke to for this story said that in customer service situations and during other fleeting interactions, they tend to defer to a nickname for the sake of convenience\u2014but that the choice to do so always involves a conscious decision-making process. \u201cThe only place I would go along with it still would be at the doctor or the hospital,\u201d R\u00f3is\u00edn said.\n\nUltimately, Americanizing someone else\u2019s name to make yourself feel more comfortable is a jackass move, especially if you just met them. People who might feel nervous about asking how to pronounce a name that seems complex on paper can rest assured that they\u2019re coming off as curious and considerate instead of lazy and oblivious. \u201cI don't really care if you pronounce it wrong if you make an effort,\u201d Ashfia said. \u201cFor me, it's a pretty simple equation: If someone has a difficult name that you can't pronounce, then you ask them how to pronounce it, you learn how to pronounce it, and you move on with your life. Instead of choosing to be ignorant, it's better to choose to learn, right?\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "Americanizing someone's name to make your life easier is at best lazy and at worst racist.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5dae1cc5bb3ed7000a345f73/lede/1571693456356-GettyImages-185988989.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8388010736653743xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
