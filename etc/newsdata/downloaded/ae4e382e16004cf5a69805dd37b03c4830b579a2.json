Boris Johnson is expected to abandon Brexit legislation in Parliament rather than accept a customs union or second referendum. Ministers are hoping to force the law through the Commons by Thursday evening in an attempt to leave the EU by the end of the month. But, after Speaker John Bercow blocked a \"clean\" vote, Remainer MPs are plotting to table amendments designed to wreck the Prime Minister's Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB). It could make it \"almost impossible\" to get the deal ratified by next week's deadline. Mr Johnson insisted last night it was time to \"move on\" as No10 outlined its hardline position on no more delays.\n\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that Britons will remain subject to rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) even if the UK leaves the EU on October 31. The Government published the 110-page WAB late last night in the Commons. It makes clear that the ECJ \"continues to have effect in domestic law\". What now? Christopher Hope has a day-by-day countdown of how the Bill can pass into law in 10 days. And Tony Diver answers all your niggling Brexit questions.", "description": "If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here and try our Audio Briefings on WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Danny Boyle", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/10/21/116blower22-10-19-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqjYeQRtCUmaNTl9ge3SkvXvsQtCHq939w7zx1f6lxc4.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
