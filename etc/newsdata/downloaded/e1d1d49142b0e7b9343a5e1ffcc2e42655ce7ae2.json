In those halcyon days, the most exciting thing about it was its very first raid, Vault of Glass. It\u2019s still considered one of the best, but there was one problem\u2014a very silly, laughably easy exploit that meant players could make the final boss simply fall off a cliff and die.\n\nTurns out that this five-year-old trick was worth keeping in mind when Destiny\u2019s newest raid, the Garden of Salvation, launched this weekend, as a very similar technique was discovered for dispatching one of its bosses.\n\nA video put together by the YouTube account Cheese Forever and shared by Eurogamer explains how it\u2019s done. The technique is a little more involved, requiring some careful timing during a precise window, but the basics are the same: You\u2019re sending a raid boss falling to their doom without spending a significant amount of time winnowing down their health. All you need is a well-placed smoke grenade from a Hunter.\n\nUnfortunately, this particular boss isn\u2019t the final encounter, and players will still have to complete the steps necessary to lower the boss\u2019s shields Once that\u2019s done, the game will register its defeat and trigger the end of this encounter.\n\nLike most silly exploits like this, odds are that it\u2019s not a trick that\u2019s long for this world, so if you\u2019re planning on cheesing this boss, do it soon, and maybe with a side of tortilla chips.", "description": "Once upon a time, Destiny was new, and no one knew what to expect from it.
