But despite her incarceration and death her snakehead gang is still going strong - although its new leader is not yet known.\n\nWithout her the gang is moving with the times and using social media apps including China\u2019s equivalent to Tinder, MoMo, as well as popular messaging app WeChat, promising '100 per cent safe travel'.\n\nSnakeshead kingpin, Cheng Chui Ping, also known as \"Sister Ping\", who ran the world's largest people smuggling network for 20 years until her death in a US jail\n\nThe south-eastern province of Fujian in China has a long histories of sending migrants abroad for cash\n\nAdverts with attractive slogans such as \u2018speedy passage of border checks! Pay upon arrival!\u2019 are circulating on apps.\n\nChina's 'village of human smuggling': Rural outpost Changle is rife with promises of a better life abroad - in province known as 'the headquarters of the Snakeheads' A man riding a scooter passes an anti-trafficking slogan painted on a building in the town of Tantou in Changle prefecture, known as the 'village of human smuggling' A large number of overseas Chinese can have their ancestry traced back to Fujian, a province on the south-eastern coast of China. Sea-faring locals started leaving home to seek new life abroad by boat as early as the 15th century. Many of them settled elsewhere South-east Asia. For example, people from Changle prefecture tend to move to the United States and people living in Lianjiang county prefer to go to the UK. The province, a large part of which is still rural and agricultural, is known as the 'headquarters of snakeheads', the nickname given to the leaders of human trafficking rings. Many locals depend on underground human smuggling operators to help them build new lives and fortunes hundreds of thousands of miles from home. Changle, an hour drive from the provincial capital of Fuzhou, has been billed as 'the village of human smuggling'. Between 1985 and 2005, more than 200,000 people moved to the United States from Changle, and the majority of them were illegal immigrants, reported BJNews citing Professor Zhuang Guotu from Xiamen University. The Changle locals believe they could find better-paid jobs overseas and their main destination is the United States. Young men give their life savings to smugglers and voyage to North America in a gamble, leaving their families behind and knowing they may never see them again. In a bid to curb the trend, the government has to paint anti-trafficking slogans along the streets flanked by villas built by families using hard-earned cash sent back to them by their relatives abroad. Although the United States is the dream country for many, nearby Taiwan, Japan as well as the UK are also among the most desirable destinations.\n\nPeople dreaming of a new life away from China pay an online deposit as low as 5,000 yuan (\u00a3550) before being crammed into boats or containers for a long, dark and risky journey, local media reported.\n\nChinese, particularly those with lower education levels, continue to be drawn to Europe and North America by the promise of much higher wages than they can earn at home, despite the considerable risks involved.\n\nThe victims would flee home hoping for a better life in the UK - but their journey to Britain would be miserable and dangerous, spending up to a month in the back of lorries in dangerous and squalid conditions.\n\nMost would be flown from China to Serbia and then transported by road through Hungary, Austria, France before a boat to Britain from Belgium or Holland.\n\nMike Gradwell, a former Lancashire Police detective superintendent who worked on the probe into the Morecambe Bay cockling tragedy in which 23 Chinese illegal immigrants drowned, told BBC Breakfast that those in the trailer were most likely trafficked by Snakehead gangs.\n\nHe said: 'These are criminal travel agents really - you go to a Snakehead to say you want to be trafficked to an economic opportunity and usually you'll borrow quite a significant amount of money.'\n\nHe said relatives were likely to have been in contact with those being trafficked, who may have been carrying phones which could be used by police to help identify them.\n\nLisa Yam, a lawyer specialising in Chinese immigration, told the programme: 'We find it is quite difficult to believe why we still have so many Chinese that choose to come into the country (like this).'\n\nTwo previous tragedies in Britain provide clues into the harrowing story which may yet lay behind the deaths of the latest victims.\n\nIn 2000, the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a sealed, airless container at Dover port. Post-mortems confirmed their deaths were due to asphyxiation. Perry Wacker, a Dutch lorry driver, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter of the immigrants who had paid a criminal gang thousands of pounds to be smuggled into the UK. The inquest heard Wacker had closed a vent at the side of the container as the lorry went onto a ferry, fearing they'd be heard.\n\nFour years later, 23 Chinese cocklepickers drowned after their ruthless gangmaster abandoned them on treacherous sands in Morecambe Bay. Their recruiter, Lin Liang Ren, who was based in the UK, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter at Preston Crown Court.\n\nBoth Dover and Morecambe Bay have at least one other thing in common: Fujian province. All those who died came from this region of south-eastern China, situated opposite the island of Taiwan.\n\nFujian is also the 'home' of the notorious Snakeheads, an off-shoot of the Triads.\n\nThe Snakeheads, who specialise in people smuggling, are so-called because those who wish to get out of China illegally need guidance as they 'twist and turn' to find ways around border controls \u2013 'a sophisticated travel service in human misery', they have been labelled.\n\nTraffickers are using social media apps including China\u2019s equivalent to Tinder, MoMo (pictured), as well as popular messaging app WeChat\n\nBack in the 1990s, their activities were focused on Hong Kong, providing black market labour mostly to the kitchens of restaurants run by Hong Kong's long-established Chinese community.\n\nChinese state media demands Britain must 'accept responsibility' for 39 dead migrants Chinese media have urged Britain and the European Union to 'accept some responsibility' for the deaths of 39 of their nationals in the Essex lorry tragedy. The story has generated huge interest in China, with 250million people reading about the news within the first hour of it being posted on Weibo, the country's version of Twitter. An editorial in the Global Times, a nationalist Government-controlled newspaper, said: 'Britain and the EU must accept some responsibility for the 39 deaths. 'It is clear the relevant countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people.' The BBC reported that there were 'some signs of media management' in China with some foreign news reports being blacked out on TV news screens. Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said that the embassy had read the reports of the deaths 'with heavy hearts'. But the embassy also suggested nationality had not been confirmed, raising the possibility that Chinese officials might not be convinced that the dead are from their country.\n\nIn the intervening years, the Snakeheads have branched out supplying young women, who are often kidnapped and forced into the sex trade in Britain. Some, as young as 11, have arrived in that country without passports or visas and claim asylum. Once there, they vanish from hostels or foster care to which they have been assigned by the immigration authorities.\n\nUK Home Office statistics show 3,641 women entered immigration detention in 2018 \u2013 with 420 of these being Chinese.\n\nThe latest annual statistics from the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) show the number of Chinese people reported to the National Referral Mechanism, which assesses instances of modern slavery, has increased by more than 50% from 293 in 2017 to 451 in 2018.\n\nBetween January to March this year, another 131 Chinese slaves were referred for help, half of whom had been found by UK Border Force or immigration enforcement teams, and other victims were reported to police in the West Midlands, Gloucestershire, Cambridgeshire and London.\n\nWhen the NCA launched a Europe-wide operation targeting slavery and human trafficking in June, there were more Chinese victims found in the UK than almost any other nationality, representing more than a fifth of the 35 victims identified at that time.\n\nThe Snakeheads, of course, also target economic migrants. They were linked to the Dover tragedy, the worst such incident of its kind in Britain which has chilling parallels with the latest discovery at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex.\n\nThe lorries in both cases entered the country from Zeebrugge in Belgium.\n\nThe terrible events of the past few days are but the latest example of the trade in \u2018human cargo\u2019 between China and Britain, a 5,000-mile route through Asia and mainland Europe that can take a month\n\nFour years later, 23 Chinese cocklepickers drowned after their ruthless gangmaster abandoned them on treacherous sands in Morecambe Bay. Their recruiter, Lin Liang Ren, who was based here, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter at Preston Crown Court\n\nThe 39 stowaways who died, it has now been confirmed, were not from Africa, the Middle East or Eastern Europe, as was initially suspected, but China\n\nIn 2000, the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a sealed, airless container at Dover port. Post-mortems confirmed their deaths were due to asphyxiation. Perry Wacker, a Dutch lorry driver, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter of the immigrants who had paid a criminal gang thousands of pounds to be smuggled into the UK\n\nThe brutality and desperation of the victims chimes with the findings of the Chinese In Britain Forum charity.\n\nWang Wei, who was smuggled into the UK via Dover, gave the following harrowing account of his journey. 'They [the criminal gang] put me inside a container and said we will take you to a safe place. Well, it took more than a month, more than 40 days. All inside the container. I didn't know where I was. I guess I was on the sea. I only noticed the container was loaded and unloaded.\n\n'They got food for me. You pee inside as well . . . inside the container for more than 40 days. I paid them more than \u00a315,000.'", "description": "Gangland boss Sister Ping died in a Texas prison in 2014 where she was serving 35 years for building the world's most sophisticated network of people smugglers.", "authors": ["Tracy You", "Martin Robinson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20180952-0-image-a-7_1572010260447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
