They are heroes that fought for everyone to be equal. It\u2019s not completely finished but, when it is, it\u2019s going to look dope. It is a big piece I\u2019m very proud of.\u201d\n\nRacism in Italian football a scourge of youth game too, say campaigners Read more\n\nKing, a quiet leader by his own admission, is softly spoken but refreshingly frank and thoughtful. To him, an only child born to a Gambian father in the Roms\u00e5s district of Oslo, those inked on his back act as inspiration. \u201cI\u2019ve got a Muhammad Ali too,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is just people who are heroes to us. There is a lot of racism going on in football lately and I can\u2019t really understand that. We are in 2019 and it\u2019s going on but that\u2019s the world we live in. As professional footballers we have to be an idol for other kids and behave in the right way. It\u2019s not nice for anyone to hear and for the likes of Pogba, Lukaku and others that have had it. I think it\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBetween the ages of two and 16, when he joined United, for whom he made two appearances before joining Blackburn, his father, Joshua, took him to visit family near Banjul, the Gambia\u2019s capital, every year. King tells of how one Christmas, when he was around eight, one of his aunties in Africa was delighted to receive a can of coke as a present.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joshua King\u2019s tattoos of \u2018people who are heroes to us\u2019. Photograph: iamjoshuaking/instagram\n\n\u201cIt makes you think: \u2018How can you ever complain about what we have in Norway?\u2019 My dad wanted me to understand what I have back home and not to take it for granted. \u2018This is your family, this is where I come from, this is my brother\u2019s kids, my cousin\u2019s kids.\u2019 Because when you\u2019re born in Norway, everything is great. It is probably one of the best places to grow up as a kid when it comes to hospitals, dentists, security.\u201d\n\nKing, who holds his hands up to being spoiled as a kid, is determined to take his son, Noah, who is three, to the Gambia one day to pass on the same lessons. \u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t get what he wants, he says: \u2018Daddy said I can have that.\u2019 But that doesn\u2019t work with me. I was once him, so I know all of the tricks in the book. He\u2019s not going to get away with a lot but taking him to Africa and making sure [he knows] that what we\u2019ve got and what I\u2019ve fought for my family to have, and I\u2019m still trying to achieve, it\u2019s not come easy. To have it, you have to work hard and I hope he will grow up to be a great man.\n\n\u201cI will always be proud of him no matter what he becomes. If he wants to be a football player, tennis player, if he wants to be an architect, a lawyer \u2013 whatever \u2013 I will always be proud of him but the one thing he can never do is try and fool me.\u201d\n\nKing smiles. \u201cWhen I come home he wants to play football but he won\u2019t play on his own. If I\u2019m in the garden, he loves to play but the problem is I come home from training and I\u2019m knackered, so I can play for a bit but he does not know what \u2018stop\u2019 or \u2018tired\u2019 means. He can literally run around in the garden for two hours straight and I haven\u2019t got the energy for that \u2013 I\u2019ve got a Premier League game on the Saturday. He\u2019s a very good kid and the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joshua King escapes the attention of two defenders during Bournemouth\u2019s win at Southampton. Photograph: Olly Greenwood/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBournemouth must consider the \u00a31m they paid Blackburn for King four years ago money well spent. As for United, King reels off a list of former teammates, including Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard, but when asked who stood out in such a talented group, he answers before the question finishes. \u201cEasy, Ravel [Morrison],\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the easiest [question]. If you ask any player at United back then, Ravel was just different class. Ravel could have been the level just below Messi and Ronaldo.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been unlucky but he\u2019s got a good heart. People have probably got the wrong impression of him. Sometimes when you grow up, it\u2019s rough and you can\u2019t control that but he\u2019s got the biggest heart and he is easily the most talented player I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d\n\nKing is reluctant to amplify the discourse surrounding Pogba but argues the price tag has been unhelpful. \u201cAt his best he is probably in the top five midfielders in the world. He gets a lot of unneeded attention, because everything he does \u2026 if he doesn\u2019t chase back and someone scores, the eyes are on him. Every time something happens at United, they point at Paul. Is it fair? Maybe not. But maybe that\u2019s what comes with the price when you pay \u00a389m.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt was not so long ago, while taking finishing advice off Solskj\u00e6r \u2013 \u201cyou would just open your ears, take it in, close your ears and try and do it in the drill\u201d \u2013 that King was considered the next generation but, at 27, he is one of the older heads at Bournemouth and with Norway, where the teenage sensation Haaland is the latest striker to generate great excitement. \u201cI think Erling will go very far because of his mindset,\u201d King says. \u201cYou can just see his hunger. He\u2019s a young kid and I feel like the Norwegian media put a lot of pressure on the young players that come through; Martin \u00d8degaard for example. Finally now you can see what he\u2019s starting to become but he\u2019s still young [20 years old].\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s aspirations are to establish Bournemouth, who host West Ham on Saturday after successive wins, as a top-10 team. Long-term, he says, there is no reason the club should not target the Europa League and, in Howe, they have a meticulous coach.\n\n\u201cThe gaffer wants the highest level from every single player, starting from the warm-up to the rondos, to the possession and passing drills, to the games \u2013 even finishing at the end. There is no messing about. You can joke once you\u2019ve come back in and training is finished but once you\u2019re on the pitch it is business. The one thing he demands of his players is workrate. If you give him that and all the other stuff doesn\u2019t come off, he\u2019ll back you all the way.\u201d", "description": "Bournemouth\u2019s striker tells Ben Fisher about his black history tattoos, the impact of visits to Gambia and teaching his son to take nothing for granted", "authors": ["Ben Fisher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfb2cb30da1ec2c0ee6d7a3fc925cabbb5c6d1dd/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37cb9ca20faddb663c3f71071771270f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
