AP\n\nIt was the year 2000 \u2014 seven years before anyone had even heard of Kim Kardashian or before Beyonc\u00e9 walked red carpets nearly nude.\n\nUp until this point, red carpets were fairly tame, fully-clothed affairs.\n\nThat is, until Jennifer Lopez arrived to the 2000 Grammys in that now infamous green Versace gown with a neckline that plunged down to her naval and was held together simply by fashion tape.\n\nAnd before Kim Kardashian self-admittedly \"broke the internet\" with her bare-bottom photos, J.Lo's dress really did.\n\nLopez wore the very same green dress at a Versace fashion show on Friday, sending the internet into meltdown once again, just 20 years later.\n\nActress Jennifer Lopez wears a creation as part of the Versace Spring-Summer 2020 collection, unveiled during the fashion week, in Milan, Italy, Friday, Sept. 20, 2019.

But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J.Lo wearing that dress.\"\n\nAs a result, Schmidt says, \"Google Image Search was born.\"\n\nSchmidt further explained how Google expanded from just text to images:\n\nOur co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin - like all other successful inventors - kept iterating. They started with images. After all, people wanted more than just text. This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world's attention.\n\nE! News recently asked Lopez if she knew she inspired the photo-based search tool, to which she responded, \"I heard that, who knew?!\"\n\nBut Lopez has yet to receive any compensation for her contribution. \"I'm a little bit upset about it,\" she joked. \"I'm sure Versace's in on it as well.\"\n\nWhen asked whether or not she wished she had gotten something from it, she teased, \"Just a small part of it... a truck full of money.\"\n\nToday, Google has thousands of options when looking for J.Lo's Grammys dress.", "description": "J-Lo's green dress at the Grammy's broke the internet in 2000 but you may not know it was that very same dress that inspired Google Images.", "authors": ["Aly Weisman", "Bill Bostock"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d86096a2e22af72bd006e14-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
