Now we have to pray for his health, because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nShe and other members of Congress had gathered at the White House Wednesday afternoon to be briefed by Trump on his decision to pull U.S. troops from a Kurdish enclave in northern Syria, allowing Turkish forces to invade the region. It was the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Pelosi since House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry of the president in late September, and it came just hours after the House passed a resolution by a bipartisan vote of 354 to 60 rebuking the president for abandoning Kurdish militias that the U.S. had recruited to fight ISIS.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump lashed out at Pelosi, according to Democrats who attended, calling her a \u201cthird-rate politician.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) More\n\nHouse Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump \u201cwas insulting, particularly to the speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe kept her cool completely, but he called her a third-rate politician,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cHe said that there are communists involved and you guys might like that. I mean, this was not a dialogue. It was a diatribe.\u201d\n\nAccording to the accounts of Democrats who attended the meeting, Pelosi confronted Trump over his change of policy, saying it had allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to gain a \u201cfoothold in the Middle East,\u201d and telling Trump that \u201call roads with you lead to Putin.\u201d\n\nTrump seems to have been caught off guard by the reaction to his decision, which was taken without consulting his Cabinet or staff after an Oct. 6 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The next day he threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d the Turkish economy with sanctions if Erdogan\u2019s forces provoked bloodshed in Syria. And on Wednesday the White House leaked an Oct. 9 letter from Trump to Erdogan that struck observers as so out of the ordinary for a communication between heads of state that for several hours journalists treated it as a possible hoax.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outside the White House on Wednesday.

Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I have obtained a copy of \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069\u2019s letter to #Erdogan. \u2066@POTUS\u2069 warns him to not \u201cbe a tough guy!
