He started researching meteorites after seeing a fireball streak across the sky in southern China in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, he began mounting expeditions into some of the world's most inhospitable areas in Russia, France, the Sahara Desert and in China's far-west Xinjiang, armed with a metal detector to scan the ground for rocks.\n\nSince then, Zhang has plotted the location of meteorite landing sites. That, he says, has helped the Chinese authorities determine that the world's biggest meteor field , which is 425 kilometers long, is in Altay, in China's far-western Xinjiang region.\n\nZhang says he went to Altay around 20 times before finding anything significant. \"Nine out of ten (times), you won't be able to find anything,\" he says.\n\nChina's meteorite hunters\n\nChina's vast plains and mountainous regions are popular hunting grounds for the nation's meteorite enthusiasts. Some of the world's biggest iron meteorites have been found there, including in Altay where Zhang competes with other hunters to find precious rocks.\n\nPart of the appeal is the sense of adventure. Accessing remote areas requires serious equipment and planning -- and with it comes the thrill of possibly finding something that pushes forward science's understanding of the solar system.\n\nFor example, scientists found organic matter associated with water -- the origin of life -- in the \"Zag and Monahans\" meteors which crashed into Texas and Morocco in 1998, raising the possibility of the existence of complex organic compounds in space.\n\nZhang Bo on a meteorite hunt in China's far-western Xinjiang region in 2016.

Do not blindly want to achieve the goal of getting rich overnight by finding a meteorite. Good life needs to be created by your own efforts and dedication. Please treat it rationally,\" the government notice said.\n\nDays after the fireball sighting, alleged meteorites were being advertised online for as much as 50,000 RMB ($7,800) a gram.\n\nXu Weibiao, a meteorite expert from the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) in Nanjing, says meteorites can sell for even more than that -- above $10,000 per gram.\n\n\"The rareness of the meteorite decides its market value,\" Xu says. \"Except those people who really know meteorite and its importance, most buyers are ordinary people and their meteorites are fake.\"\n\nThe birth of an obsession\n\nAccording to NASA , about 44 tonnes of meteoritic material falls on Earth each day. Most burns up in the atmosphere, but some survive the fall and land in bizarre places. In late July, for example, a suspected meteorite about the same size as a football landed in a rice field in eastern India\n\nThere are no confirmed cases of meteors killing humans but the International Comet Quarterly tracks near misses, and lists many occasions when meteorites have hit homes or cars.\n\nZhang Bo on a hunt for meteorites in Xinjiang, China, in 2016 Credit: Zhang Bo/Supplied\n\nZhang's obsession with meteorites started in 2009.\n\nHe was on vacation biking around the resort Chinese island of Hainan when he spotted a ball of fire grazing the night sky that was seen from the capital, Sanya, to the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea.\n\nAt the time, he was working at his family's jewelry business. But soon his fascination for meteorites took over.\n\nZhang started studying. First on the internet and in libraries, then by knocking on the door of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) in Nanjing, 300 kilometers east of Shanghai.\n\nFounded as the former Institute of Astronomy in 1928, today the PMO is the hub of China's space object research, where experts, like Xu, examine meteorites that hunters, like Zhang, bring in for verification. At first, Zhang brought them the meteorites he had bought or found for testing.\n\nAt the PMO, he met Xu and the two become friends, exchanging messages and information about meteorites.\n\nWhen evaluating meteorites, experts look for two features that separate them from regular stones or rocks: a fusion crust and regmaglypts. They are holes, or thin flow lines, on the surface of a meteorite, created by friction as the meteor passes through the atmosphere.\n\nThe fusion crust, on the other hand, is the dark, glassy coat wrapping around a meteorite. When a meteorite travels through the atmosphere, it causes the air around it to become compressed. The compressed air has a high temperature that melts the meteorite's exterior layers. When it slows down to a point where no melting occurs, that layer cools down to form the fusion crust.\n\nAccording to Xu, dust grains are the most valuable elements of any meteorite. Different isotopes within the chemical elements of the dust grains contain information about how stars evolved.\n\nZhang's obsession\n\nZhang says he made his most significant discovery in the summer of 2016. Having heard about the large meteorites found in Altay, he packed his SUV with metal detectors, shovels, a tent and enough supplies to sustain him for two weeks in one of the world's most remote regions.\n\nZhang Bo looks for meteorites in Xinjiang, China, in 2016.

It's a 7.5-hour drive from the nearest city.\n\nZhang wanted to visit the site of meteorites he had read about in journals, including one found by herdsmen in the Gobi Desert more than a century ago.\n\nDubbed the \"Silver Camel,\" the large, silvery rock is thought to have crashed to Earth in 1898. It weighed 28 tonnes and is the world's fourth-largest known iron meteorite. Today, it sits in Xinjiang Geological and Mineral Museum.\n\nZhang was also looking for meteorites related to \"The Tear of Allah,\" a huge iron meteorite weighing almost 18 tons. It was found in Altay in 1986 by a herdsmen who reportedly guarded it for 25 years until local government officials arrived with heavy machinery in 2011 to take it away.\n\nIn 2017, the herdsman was reported to be attempting to take the local government to court to claim ownership. The meteorite, referred to as \"Akebulake,\" was covered in \"several scrawls of graffiti and cuts,\" and officials moved it to the local city hall to protect it from further damage, according to official records.\n\nIron meteorites are composed almost entirely of nickel-iron alloy. They account for less than 5% of observed meteor falls, but their weight -- they are far heavier than normal rocks -- and shiny metallic exterior means they are more easily identified as meteorites.\n\nZhang Bo looks for parts of \"The Tear of Allah,\" a huge iron meteorite weighing almost 18 tons which was found in Altay in 1986.

Those asteroids are thought to be the remnants of the creation of our solar system around 4.6 billion years ago, which is why they're so valuable, and important for scientific research about our early origins.\n\nDuring his trip to Altay, Zhang meticulously recorded the coordinates of meteorites that had been found to have the same chemical composition as the \"Silver Camel\" and \"The Tear of Allah.\"\n\nZhang says his findings showed that errors had been made in official records.\n\nUsing his information, scientists were able to establish that the meteor field in Altay runs along an arc of 425 kilometers from China to Mongolia, making it the world's largest meteorite field.\n\nPreviously, the world's largest meteorite field had been found in Gibeon, Namibia, stretching 275 kilometers, south of where \"Hoba,\" the world's biggest iron meteorite was found in 1920 by a farmer. \"Hoba\" weighs 60 tonnes and, due to its vast size, it has never been moved from where it crashed into the Earth around 80,000 years ago.\n\nA big ticket item\n\nZhang won't reveal any personal details about his clients, but he says they pay anywhere between $100,000 to $1 million for rare rocks. Meteorites also command high prices at auction.\n\nA meteorite specimen displayed in a showroom in Urumqi, in Xinjiang, China, on September 19, 2014.

It sold for $275,000, up from an estimate of $60,000.\n\nThe most expensive meteorite ever sold at auction is a Lunar meteorite sold in 2018 by Boston firm RR Auction, which went for $612,500. It's known as \"The Moon Puzzle\" because it originated on the Moon and it's made up of six fragments that fit together. It was found in 2017 in the north-west African country of Mauritania, but it is believed to have landed thousands of years ago, after being blasted off the surface of the Moon by another meteorite strike.\n\nZhang says he doesn't hunt meteorites for money, but to make a contribution to science and education. So far, his travels have taken him from the Barringer Crater in the Arizona Desert to the Henbury Meteorites Conservation Reserve in Australia.\n\nHe says he'll go wherever meteors -- and their meteorites -- take him.", "description": "Meet Zhang Bo, who travels to far-flung locations armed with a metal detector, hoping he'll stumble on a fallen meteorite.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190905164020-meteorite-2-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
