And in conversations and surveys with those employees, the coffee giant realized the need to put mental health on the agenda.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, Johnson said that the company found that some employees were afraid to reach out to the Employee Assistance Program, so they\u2019re working to enhance the program, which provides short-term counseling services.\n\n\"We believe this is a societal problem and we want to take steps within Starbucks for our partners to break the stigma of mental health, acknowledge that it exists, and do some creative things to provide services to those in need,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nThere will also be other announcements to come, Johnson added.\n\nIn a company-wide memo on Thursday, Johnson said that \u201cour store managers and field leaders will experience a Mental Health Matters session with a clinical psychologist that will introduce emotional first aid, followed by a discussion about what it means to thrive and develop self-awareness.\u201d\n\nMark your calendar.
