We\u2019ve written about low-light plants, off-the-radar indoor plants, status plants, pet-safe plants and more. (Much more.) The right plant can practically transform an interior space, but not if you leave them in those plastic nursery pots they\u2019re sold in at plant stores \u2014 or when they\u2019re shipped to your door through one of the many online plant sellers.\n\nLeaving plants in those plastic pots isn\u2019t necessarily a disaster, but it\u2019s a missed opportunity. A simple ceramic pot can make that big Bird of Paradise or Monstera look less like an impulse purchase on your way out of Ikea, and more like a thoughtful addition to your living room d\u00e9cor. And if you\u2019re nervous about repotting, don\u2019t worry. You can leave your plant in that plastic pot for now. (You\u2019ll need to repot it eventually once it grows enough, but we can worry about that later.) Just get a slightly larger decorative pot and slip the plastic pot inside as a liner. As a bonus, this makes watering even easier because you don\u2019t need to worry about drainage and you can easily do everything in the sink if you want.\n\nIf you want to upgrade your indoor greenery, all you need is the right pot or planter. We found some of the best options, all conveniently available on Amazon, for any sort of plant: Trios of tiny pots for windowsill mini-succulent gardens; colorful and patterned containers that work on desktops, coffee tables, and end tables; plant stands for the crown jewel of your plant collection; along with hanging planters, outdoor planters, vases and more.\n\nGeLive Hexagon Rose Gold Succulent Planter, 3-Inches Wide A hexagonal rose-gold pot may be predictably millennial, but the bold geometric shape should make any succulent pop, and it\u2019s practically asking to be placed on a windowsill where the angled sides can catch the light. $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nExquis Home 6.5-inch White Ceramic Plant Containers With Gold and Grey Detailing (Set of 2) For slightly medium-size plants, like this royal-purple bougainvillea, go with one of these clean-lined ceramic planters with delicate gold accents. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nChive Ceramic Flower and Plant Container With Drainage Hole and Detachable Saucer (White, Large) A playful scalloped-edge keeps this bright white pot from feeling plain. It\u2019s the perfect blank canvas for displaying a favorite plant. $47 at Amazon Buy $47 at Amazon Buy\n\nNatural Terracotta Planters with Individual Trays (Set of 2) We also love the simplicity of these minimalist terracotta pots. They\u2019re about 5-inches wide, and since terracotta is naturally porous and breathable, they would make a nice home for a small-ish snake plant or ZZ plant (or really any plant that likes to dry out completely before being re-watered). $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nPeach & Pebble Pink Terrazzo Planter, 6-Inch Diameter Another terrazzo option, we know, we know. But this one is pink. And at 6-inches wide, it would be perfect for showing off a small ZZ plant on a tabletop or desk. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nLoveBoutique Ceramic Flower Plant Pot, Size 4-inch, 6-inch and 7-inch \u2014 Modern (Set of 3) Display all three of these white-and-black vases on a windowsill together, or scatter them throughout a room or apartment for a unifying theme. $70 at Amazon Buy $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nRivet Modern Geometric Ceramic Planter The muted rose color and textured geometric print give this planter an almost-handmade look. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nBloomingville Scalloped Round Ceramic Flower Pot, Sky Blue This vintage-style planter looks like something you\u2019d find at a yard sale. In a good way. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nRivet Westline Modern Hand Painted Stoneware Pot This stoneware pot is about 8-inches wide, so it\u2019s big enough to hold a standard-sized plant in a 6-inch nursery pot, but not so big that it still has a relatively small footprint. It make for a nice accent on a desk or end table, and the hand-painted bands of color are a fun and subtle touch. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nMkono Macrame Jute Rope Plant Hanger with Beads $9 (was $14, now 36% off) Another plant hanger from Mkono. This one, made from jute rope with wooden beads, has more of a hippie feel. Swap in any pot to customize the look. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nTeak & Tides Genuine-Leather Plant Hanger This leather plant hanger was one of the top picks in our article on how to hang plants. Do note that the only things for sale here are the genuine leather plant-hanging straps \u2014 the pot is not included. The company says the straps \u201ccomfortably fit\u201d pots ranging from 4 to 12 inches, so this should work with pretty much anything. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nPeach & Pebble Wood Plant Stand with 11-Inch Ceramic Planter $90 (was $125, now 28% off) A mid-century modern living room deserves a mid-century modern planter. This freestanding wood stand comes with its own 11-inch planter, so you don\u2019t need to worry about whether or not it will fit. This would be a great choice for showcasing any sort of statement floor plant like a fiddle-leaf fig or a monstera. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nRivet Mid-Century Ceramic Planter with Iron Stand Another nice planter/stand combo that comes in a few different colors and sizes. This pinkish-red option has a Southwestern feel and would be a good home for desert-dwelling cacti and succulents. From $55 at Amazon Buy From $55 at Amazon Buy\n\nMkono Jute Plant Basket, 12-Inches Wide On the softer side of the style spectrum, try this large woven basket with a large cactus or palm. You can use a simple plastic pot as a liner since no one will see it. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nIvolador Desktop Glass Bulb Vase with Solid Wooden Stand If you\u2019re into propagating cuttings, this glass bulb vase \u2014 combined with the included wooden stand \u2014 would make for a nice propagation station. It could also double as a bud vase. $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Amazon Buy\n\nCyan Design Rogue Vase Planter $34 (was $35, now 3% off) This vase, with its turquoise-swirled glass and golden flecks, is worth displaying on its own \u2014 or maybe with a hydrangea shrub in a complimentary shade of blue. $34 at Amazon Buy $34 at Amazon Buy\n\nNovelty Round Glazetone Planter, 16-Inch, Mocha $46 (was $47, now 2% off) An outdoor option, this large planter has rubber feet to prevent staining surfaces such as porches or patios, and a removable drain plug for excess water. It also has a sort of (maybe unintentional?) splatterware design. $46 at Amazon Buy $46 at Amazon Buy\n\nBehrens Galvanized Steel Round Tub, 5-Gallons, 15-Inch Diameter $13 (was $25, now 48% off) This large galvanized steel tub will have no trouble standing up to the elements outdoors, and it\u2019s an inexpensive option for creating a small and contained raised bed for growing herbs or cherry tomatoes. $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
