You know, with the passion and a few players that make a difference.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult to say whether it is better or worse but better is always shown in trophies, which aren\u2019t there at the moment.\n\n\u2018On the one hand, there are so many clubs who improved so quickly to a high level, whereas Arsenal, maybe improved, but not to that level.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s difficult and it hurts sometimes.\n\n\u2018You feel sometimes that Arsenal should do better but I\u2019m still hoping.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWenger believes Arsenal are still some way from challenging this season and has backed Liverpool to end their 30-year wait for the title.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At the moment you don\u2019t look too much at the position because the points difference is very small with anybody else,\u2019 Wenger told SPORF.\n\n\u2018You draw, you\u2019re 7th. You win a game, you\u2019re 3rd.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think [Arsenal can challenge for the title] at the moment on what I\u2019ve seen. Liverpool is too far ahead for everybody else.\n\n\u2018Man City looks to me to have the best potential to fight against Liverpool, but as long as long you\u2019re not too far away you can hope.\u2019\n\nMORE: Juventus manager Maurizio Sarri eyeing January bid for Chelsea full-back Emerson Palmieri", "description": "Dennis Bergkamp has confessed that it can be painful watching Arsenal when comparing the current team to his great side, but the iconic former striker is hopeful that Unai Emery...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-506975920_1570708384.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
