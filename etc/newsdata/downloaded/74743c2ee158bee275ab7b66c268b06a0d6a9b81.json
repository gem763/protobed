The horror genre has deep roots in Japan\u2019s cinema reaching all the way back to the 1960s and it is just as popular a genre now as it was then. In many ways, J-horror seems to have reached its peak in recent years both here in Japan and in the West, most notably through films like \"The Ring\" and \"Dark Water.\" If you haven\u2019t seen either of these, you\u2019re missing out!\n\nThe popularity of these movies though has (for me at least) created a stereotypical Japanese horror movie; a story that revolves around people encountering ghostly spirits that manifest themselves as pale, disturbing children\u2014and that inevitably ends in death.\n\nNow, I have nothing against this type of movie, in fact, some of the best J-horror films ever made fit into this formula exactly. But in some ways, these super popular movies have distorted what J-horror really is; a unique genre that pushes the boundaries and influences cinema around the world.\n\nThe list I have created below is not necessarily the best five horror movies Japan has ever produced, but movies that show the variety and uniqueness of the J-horror genre.\n\n1. Onibaba\n\n\"Onibaba\" is the oldest movie on this list and one of the oldest horror movies ever made in Japan. Released in 1964, the movie tells the story of two women: a mother and daughter-in-law left to fend for themselves in feudal Japan after the son/husband is forced to join the army. How they manage to do this, and the repercussions of their actions is what makes \"Onibaba\" a horror movie.\n\n\"Onibaba\" is a movie completely removed from what we may think of as horror today. There are no ghosts, monsters or zombies and there are few outright scares. What there is, though, is a disturbing story, dripped in suspense with a tone that unsettles you more and more as you watch.\n\nWhere to watch: There\u2019s an English subbed version of \"Onibaba' on YouTube.\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://gaijinpot.com/\n\n\u00a9 GaijinPot", "description": "For those who may not know, J-horror is the umbrella term used for any and all Japanese horror movies.
