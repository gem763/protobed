This is not contradictory. If you can get something done before the end of the day, do it while it is important, rather than leave it to become urgent tomorrow. This will encourage you to prioritise and work more efficiently during the day as you know you have to stop working at 5pm or 6pm. \u201cOrganised workplaces are productive workplaces,\u201d says Henry Stewart, chief happiness officer at Happy Ltd. \u201cI probably only call someone out of hours once a year, and that\u2019s only if it\u2019s absolutely necessary. If you\u2019re working efficiently, there\u2019s no need to work after hours.\u201d If a task is not simple enough to complete within the last half hour in the office, write a to-do list for the morning, pack away your things and you will soon get used to the idea of winding down towards the end of the working day.\n\nRedefine your limits\n\nAccept that it is impossible to get everything done \u2013 there will always be one more thing you could get on with, but work needs to have an end point. Do your best every day and do not feel guilty about clocking off. You need to gradually redefine your limits in terms of understanding what you need in order to have a mental break and tell yourself you deserve to relax.\n\nCherish your life outside of work\n\nSeparating your working life and your leisure time is essential for better psychological, mental and physical health. For Germans, it is the idea of Feierabend \u2013 \u201ccalling it a day\u201d \u2013 that upholds the evening as almost sacrosanct. Focusing on creative experiences through leisure and hobbies play a major role in alleviating stress, improving health and generally making us happier people (and workers). Whether it is going for a run, cooking a meal, toiling in the garden or catching up with friends that breaks you out of work mode, find something you enjoy, put it in the diary and stick to it.\n\nDevelop a wind-down routine\n\nEstablishing an unwinding ritual for when you get home retrains the mind to slow down \u2013 simple things such as changing out of your work clothes, having a bath or sitting outside in the fresh air can tell the brain it is time to relax. \u201cI meditate to get my mind back in shape \u2013 even if it\u2019s just for five minutes, pause and breathe, count to 10 five times, take time to think,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cWe all need rest in order to be more productive and, in my experience, nobody gets their best ideas in the office.\u201d Clear your head by reading a book, walking the dog, whatever you need to prepare your mind and body for rest. And, if you are catching up with loved ones, be present and try not to talk about work.\n\nDitch the tech\n\nAn email here and a push notification there can easily descend into an unhealthy merry-go-round, so much so that a high-flying political journalist once said she has to leave her phone on a shelf in another room to stop herself from working. \u201cDon\u2019t use emails on your phone at all, because you\u2019ll only look at it, and turn off all work-related alerts,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cI only check my emails three times each day \u2013 at 11am, 2pm and 5pm, and that means I actually look forward to it.\u201d Wean yourself off checking your phone by utilising settings such as \u201cnight shift\u201d and \u201cdo not disturb\u201d so you can glance at updates in your own time. It is a process, but learn to have peace of mind that you do not have to respond to everything instantly. If it is urgent, they will call you. If it\u2019s not, it can wait until tomorrow.", "description": "Whether it\u2019s changing your email habits or having a bath to wind down, here\u2019s how to stop your job taking over your life", "authors": ["Lucy Campbell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fac2fa965ca0e191c92b90f18c8c663e7386ae63/153_51_4735_2842/master/4735.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd793dcbfe9cf8b8acb832306f21877c", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
