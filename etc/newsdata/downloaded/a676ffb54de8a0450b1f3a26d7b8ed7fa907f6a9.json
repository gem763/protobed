Read more\n\nPersonally, I've never been super curious about McDonald's \"special\" sauce, because I had always assumed it was Thousand Island dressing. I'm also not sure exactly why one would need to make this sauce at home, because \u2014 unlike a certain Disney movie-inspired Szechuan sauce \u2014 this Mac (sauce) never went away.\n\nBut, because this is the internet, an enterprising blogger named Kelly Brinker created a recipe that that apparently comes pretty darn close to the real thing. (It isn't exactly Thousand Island, but it's very similar.) In order to verify the veracity of this claim, I made a batch and took a taste. To make the sauce, Kelly uses:\n\n1/2 cup mayonnaise\n\n4 teaspoons sweet pickle relish\n\n1 teaspoon white vinegar\n\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n\n2 tablespoons French dressing\n\n1 tablespoon finely minced white onion\n\n1 teaspoon sugar\n\nI dumped all of those fine ingredients into a bowl, stirred, and set in the fridge overnight to let all of the flavours meld.\n\nCover with plastic first.\n\nAfter the required stint in the fridge I removed the sauce for visual inspection, and I must admit that it looked the part.\n\nI didn't have two all-beef patties on hand, so I grabbed some fries and took a dip.\n\nThe sauce did taste very special, with the only real difference being that there are no actual onion pieces in the McDonald's version, but I don't know that this would be a deal breaker for anyone. So yeah, this is an A+ clone of McDonald's Big Mac sauce. This is great news for anyone who wishes to make their own Big Macs, or for those people who want to incorporate a little bit of that I-Can't-Believe-It's-Technically-Food McDonald's magic into their home cooking. In all seriousness though, it's pretty good, and I will be putting mine on many burgers.\n\nThis story has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "The recipe for McDonald's Big Mac sauce was allegedly leaked online last year.
