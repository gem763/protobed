Rich Kerry King Signature V KKV Solid-Body Electric Guitar Black, Used\n\nExcept for a 10-year period in the \u201990s when I was on ESP guitars, I\u2019ve been on B.C. Rich guitars \u2014 and generally they\u2019re custom-made for me. We come up with a paint design, and that becomes the model fans can buy. What people probably don\u2019t really consider is that we have three different guitar rigs across the world at any given time. So you have to use your A rig, your B rig, your C rig, depending on where you\u2019re performing. It cuts down on shipping, and it\u2019s cost effective for traveling the world. So there are guitars I don\u2019t even see until I see a particular rig. I\u2019m going to guess I\u2019ve got about 30 guitars? That\u2019s ballpark. I could be way off.", "description": "Slayer\u2019s Kerry King shares his favorite things, including a Mitchell & Ness Fred Biletnikoff Oakland Raiders Throwback Jersey, Judas Priest\u2019s Stained Class CD, Pantene Sulfate-Free Conditioner, and Jim Jefferies Freedumb album.", "authors": ["Kerry King", "Dominique Pariso"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/05kerry-king-wiclw/05-kerry-king-wiclw.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
