Authorities said the gunman had been fired from his job earlier in the day.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Monday that more than half of the perpetrators involved in mass shootings since 2006 have died during their rampages.\n\nCongress is scheduled to return next week from a monthlong recess, and lawmakers haven\u2019t reached a consensus on how to address gun violence.\n\nPresident Trump, who has been under pressure to propose gun legislation since two mass shootings last month in Ohio and Texas, said Sunday that his administration \u201cis committed to working with Congress to stop the menace of mass attacks.\u201d\n\nUnlike his previous comments after mass gun violence, Mr. Trump did not mention universal background checks as part of any solution.\n\n\u201cIt would be wonderful to say \u2014 to say \u2018eliminate,\u2019 but we want to substantially reduce the violent crime \u2014 and actually, in any form,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis includes strong measures to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous and deranged individuals, and substantial reforms to our nation\u2019s broken mental health system. To reduce violence, we must also ensure that criminals with guns are put behind bars and kept off the streets.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden said Mr. Trump \u201chas no intestinal fortitude to deal with this.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters while campaigning in Iowa, Mr. Biden reiterated his position on banning assault weapons and said he sees \u201cno compromise\u201d with Republicans in Washington.\n\n\u201cThis is one we have to just push, push, and push,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing [from Republicans]. The president has no intestinal fortitude to deal with this. He knows better. His instinct was to say, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re going to do something on background checks.\u2019 What\u2019s he doing? Come on, this is disgraceful. This is disgraceful what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nShortly after mass shootings last month in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, that killed 31 people, Mr. Barr said he would propose legislation to expedite the death penalty for mass murderers and cop killers.\n\n\u201cWe will be proposing legislation providing that in cases of mass murder, or in cases of murder of a law enforcement officer, there will be a timetable for judicial proceedings that will allow imposition of any death sentence without undue delay,\u201d the attorney general told the Fraternal Order of Police convention in New Orleans on Aug. 12. \u201cPunishment must be swift and certain.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Trump \u201cwill not let acts of mass shootings and domestic terrorism go unanswered.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been consulting widely and has directed me and [FBI] Director [Christopher A.] Wray to work with our state and local partners, as well as the private sector, to develop strategies and measures to address these threats, including developing tools that can assist us in detecting potential mass shooters before they strike,\u201d Mr. Barr said at the time. \u201cI anticipate that we will be sharing range of proposals \u2014 legislative as well as operational \u2014 in the near future.\u201d\n\nThe president said Sunday that he is talking with many lawmakers in the House and the Senate about proposals to reduce gun violence. He downplayed renewed calls for universal background checks on firearm purchases, saying the proposal would not have prevented any of the recent mass shootings.\n\n\u201cAs strong as you make your background checks, they would not have stopped any of it,\u201d the president said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
