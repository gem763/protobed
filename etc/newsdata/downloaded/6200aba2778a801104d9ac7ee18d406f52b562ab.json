Sacoolas left the U.K. in early September under diplomatic-immunity protections and has not been seen in public since.\n\nAfter Killing Teen in U.K., Runaway Wife of U.S. \u2018Spy\u2019 Provokes Diplomatic Crisis\n\nThe Dunn family, now in the United States to drum up support to send Sacoolas back to the U.K. to face justice, had accepted an \u201curgent\u201d invitation by the White House from National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, to visit Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. Trump, it seems, thought he could convince the Dunns to meet the woman who killed their son, and would do so by opening a side door through which she would walk. The whole scene would be captured by a pool of photographers who had been summoned for the meeting.\n\nBut the Dunns would have none of it and refused to meet her. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said that the family felt \u201cambushed\u201d when the \u201cbombshell\u201d was dropped that Sacoolas was next door.\n\nThey had envisioned meeting her one day, but as Seiger told The Daily Beast, \u201conly on British soil\u201d and \u201conly with mediators, counselors, and their legal team in tow.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on the Dunn\u2019s Justice4Harry GoFundMe page, Seiger explained what happened. \u201cThe family had four surprises yesterday,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFirstly, being invited to the White House in the first place which came right out of the blue.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Dunn\u2019s father Tim had suggested on CBS News earlier in the day that he would like to meet the president \u201cman to man, father to father\u201d to plead with him to send Sacoolas back to face justice.\n\nSeiger said the second surprise was that they had not expected to actually meet the president in person. But the third was the doozy.\n\n\u201cThirdly that Mrs. Sacoolas was present in the building and fourthly that it was the president\u2019s intention for Harry\u2019s family to meet Mrs. Sacoolas in the Oval Office in front of several photographers in what was obviously designed to be a press call,\u201d Seiger wrote in his statement.\n\nThe Dunn family blames National Security Adviser O\u2019Brien for the misstep. \u201cIt struck us that this meeting was hastily arranged by nincompoops on the run and in particular Mr. O\u2019Brien, who appeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well in this meeting which required careful handling and sensitivity,\u201d Seiger wrote. \u201cThe family remain open to the possibility of meeting Mrs. Sacoolas one day in the future but in a neutral and appropriately controlled environment.\u201d\n\nIn other words, not in a reality-TV setting.\n\nThe Dunn family did say they were impressed with Trump before he tried to spring Sacoolas on them. Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, described Trump as \u201cquite respondent\u201d and that he tried to comfort her.\n\n\u201cWhen he [President Trump] held my hand, I gripped it a lot tighter and I was honest with him and just said, as I said a while ago, \u2018If it was your son you would be doing the same as us,\u2019\u201d Charles told the British news media traveling with them. \u201cHe actually gripped my hand a little bit tighter and said \u2018Yes I would be.\u2019 And that\u2019s when he said he would try and look at this from a different angle.\u201d\n\nThe Dunns have said they would ask a court for a suspended sentence for Sacoolas if she is convicted of their son\u2019s wrongful death. But only under the condition that she return to the U.K. to engage in the investigation and stand trial, if one is ordered. If she agrees to that, they say they will agree to meeting her in person and accepting what they assume would be her apology.\n\nSacoolas has apologized through her lawyer, Amy Jeffress, who issued a statement that said the press has been reporting this case all wrong. \u201cAnne is devastated by this tragic accident,\u201d the statement says. \u201cNo loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nThe Dunns are clearly good people who are asking for nothing more than respect for the law and for their son. Requests to the State Dept. and White House for comment have not been answered.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the nature of the meeting yesterday, the family would welcome any such further intervention so that this nightmare scenario can be brought to an end,\u201d Seiger wrote. \u201cThey look forward forward to engaging with the president again as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
