It recouped a\n\nfraction of the fall in Asian trade to hold at $1.2217.\n\nThe dollar, meanwhile, gave up some ground gained overnight\n\nas the U.S. imposition of visa restrictions on Chinese officials\n\nover the treatment of Muslim minorities threatened to derail\n\nalready delicate trade negotiations. The move, together with the blacklisting of Chinese firms\n\nover the same issue, cast a pall over Sino-U.S. talks in\n\nWashington, sending investors to safety.\n\n\"The tensions will persist through to the year-end at\n\nleast,\" said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer in Auckland, who is\n\nnot expecting the talks to deliver a breakthrough deal.\n\n\"It'll be volatile good news, bad news, repeat for the rest\n\nof the year, but overall a negative tone.\"\n\nThe safe-haven Japanese yen edged higher, with the\n\ndollar buying 107.00 yen.\n\nIn other markets, stocks tumbled and bond yields fell.\n\nSafe-haven flows had also supported the dollar overnight,\n\nalong with comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell,\n\nwhich were interpreted as suggesting further rate cuts later in\n\nOctober were not a done deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, against a basket of currencies the dollar\n\nwas slightly softer at 99.126, while it fell marginally\n\nagainst the trade-exposed Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n\nThe Aussie traded at $0.6731 AUD=D3 and the kiwi NZD=D3\n\nat $0.6304.\n\nThe euro was steady at $1.0957 as Brexit jitters\n\nstalled its gradual recovery from a 2-1/2-year low hit last\n\nweek.\n\nU.S. and Chinese trade deputies are meeting in Washington\n\nahead of high-level talks involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He,\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury\n\nSecretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday.\n\nBut prospects for progress appear to be dimming as tensions\n\nrise. A Chinese diplomat told Reuters that China wanted a deal,\n\nbut it cannot be a \"zero-sum game\".\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, is moving ahead with\n\ndiscussions around restrictions on capital flows into China,\n\nBloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the\n\nmatter.\n\n\"The relationship between China and the U.S. continues to\n\ndeteriorate,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at\n\nbroker CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\"Hopes for progress at the Washington meeting of top\n\nnegotiators on Thursday night fell with risk assets.\"\n\nThe Chinese yuan CNH= , the most sensitive currency to the\n\ntrade talks, had dropped to a one-month low overnight and was\n\nsteady near that level at 7.1600 per dollar in offshore trade.", "description": "FOREX-Sterling soft, dollar drifts lower as trade hopes fade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/us_dollar_notes2_800x533_L_1411908754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
