Hulu's own six-year deal, which it struck in 2015, was worth $130 million.\n\nREAD MORE: We compared Netflix's top assets to new rivals like Disney Plus and HBO Max as the streaming battle heats up\n\n\"Seinfeld\" will stream worldwide on Netflix and was only available domestically on Hulu, which raises its price tag (it currently streams in some international markets on Amazon Prime Video). But Netflix can also afford to drop that much money compared to Hulu, especially if it wants to retain its status as streaming champion.\n\nAs venture capitalist and former Amazon Studios executive Matthew Ball tweeted this week, a nine-figure deal is \"a lot easier to stomach\" when Netflix has over 150 million subscribers worldwide and 60 million in the US, as opposed to Hulu's 28 million US subscribers.\n\nThe void left by \"Friends,\" \"The Office,\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" when they leave Netflix will be tough to fill, but perhaps \"Seinfeld\" can find a larger audience than it did on Hulu among Netflix's millions of worldwide subscribers.", "description": "\"Seinfeld\" didn't even crack the top 10 of Hulu's most popular shows so far this year, according to viewership data from Jumpshot.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8502352e22af0f357c4e2f-1334-667.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
