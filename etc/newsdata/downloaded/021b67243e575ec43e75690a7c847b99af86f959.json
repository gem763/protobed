While Southgate said it is \u201cdown to every individual player\u201d to behave as he saw fit once \u201creleased from the squad\u201d he was clear that it was a harsh lesson learnt by the 22-year-old and a reminder to the rest of the squad of the \u201cspotlight\u201d that comes with playing for England.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to discuss individuals but I know pretty much everything about all of my players,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI watch every minute of their football whether that's live or downloaded on a Sunday morning or a Sunday night, or a Monday morning. I speak to their club managers, I speak with (Under-21 coach) Aidy [Boothroyd] and all the coaches of the junior teams. So, we never know absolutely everything, but we have a very clear picture of every player, and that\u2019s the due diligence that we should always do.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate has delivered a clear warning to the England players that he is continually monitoring their behaviour off the field as well as their performances on it.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212778449-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg3C0R_SaMHCRKHFaU83wiy8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
