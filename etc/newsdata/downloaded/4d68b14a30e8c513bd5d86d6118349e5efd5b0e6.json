Aurora cautiously asks if Maleficent (Angelina Jolie), her now-redeemed fairy godmother, might go with her to meet the parents: Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) and King John (Robert Lindsay). It\u2019s so much fun watching Maleficent prepare for the meeting by practicing such basic cordialities as smiling and small talk that it\u2019s hard not to wish the movie sees the fearsome sorceress through the entire battery of wedding planning. Maleficent at a bridal shower. Maleficent choosing the table settings.\n\nSadly, such fun is not to be had in \u201cMistress of Evil,\u201d a needless sequel to the 2014 \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d riff that fails to fully value the entire of appeal of these films: Jolie\u2019s Maleficent. The first movie, a box-office hit, was a mess but its star attraction was the one thing it had going for it. Jolie, an unfortunately infrequent presence on the screen these days, slid into the role so perfectly, dominating all around her with Norma Desmond command and cheekbones that could slice your throat.\n\nThe character had its roots in those \u201850s melodrama stars; Marc Davis, animator of the 1959 Disney film, also sculpted Cruella de Vil. And in teaming Jolie with the equally potent Pfeiffer, whose queen quickly turns into Maleficent\u2019s bitter foe, \u201cMistress of Evil\u201d had the potential of summoning the intoxicating stuff of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis.\n\nBut the movie, with Joachim R\u00f8nning (\u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d) taking over for Robert Stromberg, overcomplicates itself. Instead of aiming for the elemental simplicity of a fairy tale, \u201cMistress of Evil\u201d fills itself with the politics and detail of the fairy-human struggle, building inevitably to a PG-friendly war between Queen Ingrith\u2019s army and the magical spirits of the Moors, spread out across impressively vast computer-generated palace grounds.\n\nIt\u2019s starting to seem like every franchise film, when in search of a story, throws a battle against the wall and hopes something sticks. Not only has this gotten tiresome, but it also sacrifices what we came here for in the first place: Jolie and Pfeiffer glowering at each other. But all the necessary buildup to the clash (including Chiwetel Ejiofor as among an exiled group of winged creatures called the dark fey) robs us of enough screen time with Jolie\u2019s Maleficent.\n\nThe plot in \u201cMaleficent\u201d drew largely from its inventive redemption of a classic Disney villain. But it didn\u2019t really follow through on the possibilities of fairy tale revisionism. It simply offered up another villain (Aurora\u2019s father King Stefan), just as \u201cMistress of Evil\u201d does with its dastardly Queen Ingrith. A better film would have kept playing with inverted archetypes.\n\nWhat saves \u201cMistress of Evil\u201d from a worse fate, in the end, is Fanning. Aurora, like many of Fanning\u2019s performances, is a welcome dash of naturalism amid all the CGI action. She\u2019s such an innocent and wholesome young bride, though, that perhaps she\u2019s ripe for reconsideration, too. Next time, maybe Beauty breaks bad.\n\n\u201cMaleficent: Mistress of Evil,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of fantasy action/violence and brief scary images. Running time: 118 minutes. Two stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of PG: Parental guidance suggested.
