Wendy\u2019s WEN, +0.08% and its franchisees will hire about 20,000 workers to take the breakfast menu across the country from more than 300 U.S. restaurants now. As of June 30, Wendy\u2019s and its franchisees operated 6,719 Wendy\u2019s restaurants.\n\nThe fast-food chain said it will update its 2019 guidance to take the one-time investment into account though \u201call other elements of the company\u2019s 2019 outlook remain unchanged.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be down 3.5% to 6.5%. The FactSet consensus for 2019 EPS is 61 cents, up 3.2% from the last year. Global sales growth is expected to be 3% to 4%, while the FactSet consensus is for sales of $1.70 billion, up 6.7%.\n\nRead: Starbucks warns of profit-growth miss as stock\u2019s rapid rise prompts \u2018pull forward\u2019 of buybacks\n\nWendy\u2019s will update its 2020 guidance and long-term goals at the October 11 investor day event.\n\nWendy\u2019s stock closed Tuesday down 10.2% after reaching a record high on September 5. The stock has rallied 26.3% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% is up almost 19% for the period.\n\n\u201cWendy\u2019s products and menu are well regarded and its bacon strength is a product line that resonates at breakfast,\u201d wrote Brett Levy, executive director at MKM Partners, in a note. \u201cAs a result, there is the potential for its breakfast initiative to benefit from the support and leverage from its existing menu\u2019s brands and strengths.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s says it will use its Applewood smoked bacon in the form of the Breakfast Baconator and the Frosty-ccino, a play on the frozen, creamy dessert item, as fuel for the breakfast menu.\n\nLevy notes that Wendy\u2019s has tried to add breakfast to the lineup in the past, but in late 2012 decided to abandon the effort until it finds \u201ca more profitable way to approach that daypart opportunity.\u201d\n\nMKM Partners doesn\u2019t know what exactly has changed to prompt this latest effort, but it maintains its neutral stock rating and $20 fair value estimate.\n\nSee: Chicken sandwich wars: Popeyes, Chick-fil-A and Wendy\u2019s are waging an all-out food fight on Twitter\n\n\u201cThe integration of breakfast creates additional layers of complexity and uncertainty into its story, which is one already facing a challenged landscape,\u201d Levy said.\n\nData from market intelligence company CivicScience shows that 36% of American ages 18 and older are \u201cat least somewhat likely\u201d to give Wendy\u2019s breakfast a try. And 13% said they\u2019ll go to Wendy\u2019s more now that breakfast is served.\n\nBTIG analysts led by Peter Saleh are even more pessimistic about the announcement, downgrading Wendy\u2019s to neutral from buy.\n\n\u201cWhile breakfast remains a major hole in the concept\u2019s offering, we believe this launch could prove to be an uphill battle much like the previous attempts,\u201d the note said. \u201cWe are cautious on the prospects given the required upfront investment but uncertain payoff, additional labor needs at a time of already low availability, necessity to take market share from established competitors like McDonald\u2019s and general difficulty of daypart expansion in the industry.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say the company also didn\u2019t do \u201cthemselves any favors\u201d by not elaborating further on why this time will be successful.\n\nStifel analysts also note that it\u2019s unclear what has changed, but outlines why Wendy\u2019s has struggled in the past, including unfavorable outlook for franchise profitability, other initiatives that were set to launch, and a lack of commitment from previous management.\n\n\u201cDuring the past four years, Wendy\u2019s has successfully shifted to a highly-franchised business model (95% from 78%), significantly reduced its overhead structure, but it has struggled to deliver higher system sales growth,\u201d Stifel said.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: KFC is selling meatless fried chicken -- is it actually healthier than the real thing?\n\nDow Jones Market Data Group\n\nAnalysts maintained their hold stock rating and $18.50 price target until a \u201ccredible plan\u201d for growth is provided.\n\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts are also upbeat about new addition.\n\n\u201cWe expect deserved investor skepticism on Wendy\u2019s breakfast effort, but apparent buy-in from franchisees is encouraging,\u201d wrote SunTrust\u2019s Jake Bartlett, in a note.\n\nSince there were previous false starts, SunTrust assumes the company has made a \u201ccompelling case\u201d to franchisees. Analysts also note that Wendy\u2019s is the only quick-service restaurant chain not to offer breakfast, with McDonald\u2019s MCD, +0.33% bringing in 25% of its U.S. sales over McMuffins and other breakfast items; Burger King, which is part of Restaurant Brands International Inc.\u2019s QSR, +0.71% portfolio, tallying about 15% of its U.S. sales from breakfast; and Jack In The Box Inc. JACK, +0.12% generating 20% of U.S. sales from that menu.\n\n\u201cWhile breakfast is a tough daypart to enter, given the habitual nature of the occasion, and structural issues such as real estate placement (on the way to work vs. not), Taco Bell\u2019s success shows that the obstacles can be overcome,\u201d SunTrust said. At Taco Bell, 6% of U.S. sales were at breakfast within two years of launching in the first quarter of 2014. Growth was in the low double digits in mid-2016.\n\nTaco Bell is part of the Yum Brands Inc. YUM, -0.19% portfolio.\n\nSunTrust rates Wendy\u2019s shares buy with a $24 price target, up from $22.", "description": "Wendy\u2019s announced that it would introduce breakfast nationwide in 2020 and analysts are cautious after a number of previous failed attempts to do so.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR001_wendys_ZG_20190910102134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
