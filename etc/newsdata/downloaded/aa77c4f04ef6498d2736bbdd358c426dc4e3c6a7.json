VI has over 1,400 customers (with no significant customer concentration), about 35 employees, and has been growing consistently the last several years. The company has also recently launched its new, strategic Communications Platform as a Service (or CPaaS) product. CPaaS is an exciting new product category receiving significant attention from customers and investors alike, that enables developers to add communication capabilities (such as voice, video, messaging, etc.) to their software and web applications without having to be communications nor networking experts.\n\nSangoma\u2019s pedigree in the SIP Trunking business is underscored by its performance in the recent report titled \u201c2019 SMB SIP Trunking Customer Satisfaction\u201d, conducted by the Eastern Management Group. The report details a survey of 3,000 IT managers in a side-by-side comparison of 29 SIP trunk providers. Customers evaluated their SIP vendors on six Customer Satisfaction Measurements under the headings of product, vendor experience, and customer delight. In Eastern Management Group\u2019s survey, Sangoma received the highest possible ranking \u2014 four stars, in every customer satisfaction measurement: technology and product, purchase experience, support, management tools, total overall satisfaction, and recommend-to-a-friend. Out of 29 SIP trunking companies examined in the Eastern Management Group\u2019s latest survey, none beat Sangoma. No vendor other than Sangoma received the highest possible ranking \u2014 four stars \u2014 in every customer satisfaction category.\n\n\u201cWe continue to look for prudent ways to grow our product portfolio, customer base, distribution network, overall sales, recurring revenue and EBITDA,\u201d said Bill Wignall, President and CEO of Sangoma. Wignall continued, \u201cThis acquisition is strategic to Sangoma for all of those reasons, and with about 90% of VI revenue being recurring, it should increase Sangoma\u2019s proforma recurring/services revenue to approximately 45% of total sales. We know the SIP trunking business well, so adding a wholesale channel model to our existing go-to-market approach is quite strategic and it may provide the sales organizations for both companies with additional revenue synergies. We are also excited to now add a CPaaS offering to our growing product portfolio. I\u2019d like to welcome all of our new staff who I\u2019m very pleased to say will be staying with the company, as well as our valued new clients and partners, to the expanding Sangoma family.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition, Sangoma\u2019s eighth in eight years, provides the combined Company with several strategic advantages including: increased scale, a recurring revenue contribution that continues to grow, an entirely new product category in CPaaS, robust EBITDA margins, and an excellent new sales channel that has expressed the desire for Sangoma\u2019s broader portfolio.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that mattered most to us as former owners, was how the buyers would handle the VI employees and customers,\u201d said Jason Tapolci, co-founder, shareholder and longtime CEO of VoIP Innovations. \u201cOf all the buyers who considered the acquisition of VI, it became very clear to us that Sangoma was the company that most understood, appreciated and valued our long-term staff, loyal customers and company vision. We are very pleased that Sangoma will continue on with the VI business and we are confident it will continue to grow under the leadership of their very capable management. We have had the pleasure of getting to know the Sangoma team through these discussions and are excited to see VI taken to the next level.\u201d\n\nVoIP Innovations\u2019 employees will continue to work out of their current Pittsburgh office and will be led by Sebastian Kiely, VI\u2019s President, who will report to Sangoma\u2019s CEO, Bill Wignall.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Sangoma paid an upfront consideration of US$36 million (the \u201cUpfront Consideration\u201d) which consisted of US$30 million in cash and US$6 million in Sangoma common shares, representing 5,500,417 Sangoma common shares based on the ten (10)-day volume weighted average price as of the date of execution of the definitive agreement. In addition, there is a contingent consideration component of up to US$6 million (the \u201cContingent Consideration\u201d) that will be payable in cash upon achievement of certain revenue milestones in the twelve (12) months following the date of closing. This would lead to a total purchase price of US$42 million if achieved, on a debt-free and cash-free basis, subject to customary net working capital adjustments. VI has no debt, generated US$18.9 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, with US$3.3 million of Net Income under US GAAP, that would have generated EBITDA of about US$5.6 million, implying an upfront purchase price of about 6.4x EBITDA on a trailing basis. Please see below for a reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA.\n\nThe cash portion of the consideration was funded through a combination of cash on hand and, to minimize dilution, a new credit facility, jointly from TD and BMO replacing Sangoma\u2019s existing debt. Approximately C$46 million has been drawn on this facility of which approximately C$22 million will be used to pay off all existing debt and around C$24 million to fund this acquisition. This new facility also provides for up to C$8 million in a term loan, which would be utilized in about one year, to pay out any of the up to US$6 million in contingent consideration earned, but which would only be drawn upon if required at that time. Finally, it also includes a C$10 million revolver available for general working capital purposes. The new credit facility will be drawn in US dollars, be repaid over 6 years and is expected to have an interest rate of 6.75% per annum at closing.\n\nOutlook for Fiscal Year 2020 to Include the VI Acquisition\n\nFor fiscal year 2019, Sangoma had previously issued guidance of over $100 million in revenue and $11 million in EBITDA. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2019 on June 30, Sangoma announced in early August, that preliminary, unaudited revenue for the full fiscal 2019 year, was over $109 million. Sangoma earlier today released its audited results for fiscal 2019 with revenue of $109.6 million and EBITDA of $12.3 million. Following the closing of the acquisition today, VoIP Innovations, LLC will contribute just over eight (8) months of results towards Sangoma\u2019s fiscal year 2020 which runs from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. It is expected that combined revenues will increase to between C$135 million and $143 million in fiscal 2020. Further, the Company anticipates generating EBITDA of between approximately C$19 and $20 million this fiscal year. Sangoma\u2019s leverage would then be projected to be about 2.4 times total debt to EBITDA, or under 2x net debt to EBITDA.\n\nTransaction Advisor\n\nINFOR Financial Inc. acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Sangoma in connection with the transaction.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nManagement will discuss this acquisition more fully on a conference call at 8 am EDT, Monday October 21, 2019. The dial-in number for the call is 1-800-319-4610 (International 1-604-638-5340) and investors are requested to dial in 5 to 10 minutes before the scheduled start time and ask to join the Sangoma call.\n\nAbout Sangoma Technologies Corporation\n\nSangoma Technologies is a trusted leader in delivering Unified Communications solutions for SMBs, Enterprises, OEMs, Carriers and service providers.

Although Sangoma believes that the expectations represented by such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the current business environment, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct as these expectations are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Some of the risks and other factors which could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to changes in exchange rate between the Canadian Dollar and other currencies, the variability of sales between one reporting period and the next, changes in technology, changes in the business climate in one or more of the countries that Sangoma operates in, changes in the regulatory environment, the rate of adoption of the Company\u2019s products in new markets, the decline in the importance of the PSTN and new competitive pressures.
