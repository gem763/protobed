The Trump administration denies that the ban targets Muslims despite the president promising during the 2016 election that he would enact a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,\" according to The Hill.\n\n\n\nRamotowski said that some visa applicants from restricted countries may be eligible for a State Department waiver or one of the department\u2019s exceptions to the ban, CNN reported. In response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., Ramotowski said \u201cmore than 7,600 waivers have been granted.\u201d He said about 72,000 people from restricted countries have applied for visas in total since the ban was first put in place and about 15,000 applications are still being processed.\n\n\n\nDuring the hearing, Jayapal quoted data released by the State Department in February that showed between Dec. 8, 2017 and Oct. 31, 2018 only about 5 percent of visa applicants from restricted nations were granted a waiver. Another 29 percent remained in limbo during the security process.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who is Muslim, also challenged Ramotowski and suggested officials received pressure from the White House to deny waiver requests. Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said the waiver process \u201cappears to be something of a sham,\u201d and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., described it as a \u201cphony.\u201d\n\nRamotowski denied Omar\u2019s allegations and said that while the ban has opponents \u201cfundamentally it\u2019s designed to try to keep the United States safe.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nThe travel ban faced a number of legal challenges, with the Supreme Court upholding the latest and third version of the order in a June 2018 decision. Iraq, Chad, and Sudan had been on restricted lists, but were removed. Democrats have sought to overturn the ban and introduced the \"No Ban Act\" to both chambers of Congress in April, CNN reported. The measure is not expected to make it past the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "More than 30,000 people have been denied entry into the United States as a result of President Trump\u2019s travel ban, according to a State Department officials who testified in front of Congress Tuesday.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/Department-of-State.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
