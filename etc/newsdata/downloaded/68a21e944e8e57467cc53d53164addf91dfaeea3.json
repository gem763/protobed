In the first respect, the film offers little beyond broad lampoonery. The Nazis figured onscreen (played by Sam Rockwell, Stephen Merchant, Rebel Wilson, and other familiar-ish faces) are depicted as utterly buffoonish. Likewise, Waititi\u2019s Hitler is a madcap goofball who peppers his zanily cartoonish performance with anachronistic slang. \u201cHeil me, man!\u201d he enthuses early on, nipping a joke from Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s 1942 Nazi-occupation comedy To Be Or Not Be. And this pretty much sums up Waititi\u2019s humor: He says \u201cman\u201d where one might not expect him to. Jojo\u2019s jokes, such as they are, come across like softballs lobbed straight over the plate. There\u2019s a bit about how tedious it is to offer the customary Nazi greeting to a room full of acquaintances. There\u2019s a gag detailing a Nazi captain\u2019s garish uniform designs. A dopey kid in a Nazi uniform mishandles a bazooka. Etc.\n\nA major problem here is that playing this historical material for laughs feels utterly facile. This is especially true when it comes to the indoctrination of the impressionable youth, which Jojo takes as its ostensible subject. (The opening credits score footage of Nazi rallies to the Beatles\u2019 German-language version of \u201cI Want To Hold Your Hand,\u201d drawing a nifty connection between Beatlemania and Hitlermania as some manic youth cult, which the film never bothers to develop.) Take the Nazi Education Ministry\u2019s introduction of \u201csocial arithmetic,\u201d in schools, which reworked basic math lessons as forms of indoctrination. One such question, no-joke, asked: \u201cThe proportion of nordic-nordic-dalian blood in the German people is estimated at 4/5 of the population. A third of these can be regarded as blond. According to these estimates, how many blond people must there be in the German population of 66 million?\u201d Played straight, this sort of profoundly terrifying indoctrination may call attention to its own inanity. But Waititi, who is seemingly possessed by the desire to make sure his audience gets it, lest his \u201clet\u2019s laugh at the Nazis\u201d gambit be deemed garish or tasteless, takes pains to double-underline the jokes.\n\nEarly on, Rockwell\u2019s Captain Klenzendorf even acknowledges the pointlessness of incuclating kids like Jojo, given the advancing Allied armies and the Reich\u2019s nigh-inevitable defeat. Another laugh-line: \u201cWe Aryans are one thousand times more civilized than any other race. Now get your things together, kids, it\u2019s time to burn some books!\u201d This smug, knowing quality defines Waititi\u2019s approach. Jojo Rabbit\u2019s big revelation is that the Nazi ideology of ethnic superiority was cobbled together on a wobbly ground of rank hypocrisy and, even more broadly, that love is preferable to hate. It is boringly self-congratulatory, obsequiously flattering both the audience and the filmmakers.\n\nDespite its evident failings, the film took home the coveted Peoples\u2019 Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival, an honor that serves as something of a bellwether for aspiring Oscar-season contenders (previous winners include American Beauty, Slumdog Millionaire, The King\u2019s Speech, 12 Years a Slave and Green Book, all of which went on to win Best Picture). This commendation is hardly surprising given how much Jojo shares with these other certified crowd-pleasers. With its mile-wide lampooning and deliberate avoidance of the breadth of Nazism\u2019s horrors (anti-Semitism may be front-and-centre, but the Holocaust itself is never confronted head-on), Jojo Rabbit never risks actually disturbing its audience. Instead, they are left comforted by the notion that it is bad to hate and that simply recognizing that truism is the basis of a moral life.\n\nThis is too bad. Especially because Waititi\u2019s plot depicts the ways that satire can pierce through ideology and change an audience\u2019s outlook. When young Johannes discovers the refugee Elsa in his house, he commits to writing a book about the supposed Jewish menace, in a bid to ingratiate himself to the Nazi brass who deem him a feckless coward. The poker-faced Elsa indulges him, playing directly to the child\u2019s paranoia, feeding him \u201cfacts\u201d about the age at which Jewish children sprout their horns, and how they sleep suspended upside-down from the ceiling, like vampire bats. Like a good satirist, Elsa assumes her oppressor\u2019s point-of-view, exposing the utter stupidity of his beliefs by playing right to them. The disconnect between Elsa\u2019s increasingly fiendish descriptions of Jews and her own personality (alternating between tender and tough) rupture\u2019s Jojo\u2019s dizzy faith in the Nazi party, creating a crack of cognitive dissonance that she pries open.", "description": "Despite its setting in Nazi Germany, Taika Waititi\u2019s movie never risks actually disturbing its audience.", "authors": ["John Semley"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/766ecfda2679847ce5b2a94f7e1fa14bec0eba7a.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
