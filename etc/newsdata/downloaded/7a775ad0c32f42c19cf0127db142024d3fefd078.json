A disproportionate number of these -- about 60 percent -- are girls.\n\n\"In the worst case scenario if the Taliban limit women's presence to the work space, (tech is) a skill that can get them beyond their doorsteps,\" Forough said.\n\nThe games and apps are both educational and entertaining. Some include memories of the coders or are based on true stories.\n\nFor instance, in the \"Fight Against Opium\" game, soldiers are deployed on a mission to poppy-growing Helmand province. It was based on a true story of one of the coders' brothers who was deployed to the southern province.\n\n\"My main goal as a game and app developer is to make as many educational games for girls as possible,\" Code to Inspire student Nasrin Wahidy said in a recent visit by AFP to the Herat school where the programme is based.\n\n\"We want the girls to learn and get educated faster through games.\"\n\nAnother game teaches young Afghans how to recognise the geography of their country by showing them where each province is located.\n\nSo far, Code to Inspire has taught more than 150 students to code, make games and apps, and develop websites.\n\n\"They will become a digital citizen of the world without considering geographical boundaries,\" Forough said.", "description": "Like the princess who hops over goblins and throws daggers at evil wizards in the video game they built, a team of women coders in patriarchal Afghanistan wants to inspire a generation of girls to smash obstacles.
