USA TODAY\n\nIs the U.S. government hiding the existence of aliens? According to whistleblower Edward Snowden, the answer is no.\n\nThe former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor wrote about his discoveries \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 in his recent memoir \u201cPermanent Findings\u201d and again confirmed it during an interview on the podcast \u201cJoe Rogan Experience.\u201d\n\nHe also said on the podcast that \"there probably are aliens\" but dismissed the conspiracy theories that say the U.S. government is working overtime to conceal them.\n\nSnowden, who is living in exile in Moscow, said he combed through databases before leaving his job at the NSA and found no evidence that would substantiate the conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cI went looking on the network, right,\u201d he said on Wednesday's episode. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything. If it\u2019s hidden, and it could be hidden, it\u2019s hidden really damn well, especially for people on the inside.\u201d\n\nUS government sues Snowden over new memoir: 'Intelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit.'\n\nThe Justice Department filed a lawsuit in September against Snowden, saying his memoir violates nondisclosure agreements he signed with the CIA and NSA.\n\nThe internationally recognized whistleblower made headlines when The Washington Post and The Guardian published stories based on his leaks detailing the U.S. government's mass surveillance program, including access to the cellphone records of millions of Americans.\n\nSnowden said that he does not regret his actions and that he wants to return to the United States.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, USA TODAY.
