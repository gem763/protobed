Unlike years before, in the last few weeks, the members of this community began to rebel, expressing their rejection towards Ripple and its massive sales of XRP, blaming it for having an essential role in the bearish trend of the token.\n\nXRP has never been the cryptoverse\u2019s cup of tea. The rejection towards this digital currency is widespread, especially among purists and maximalists who see the token as everything contrary to the idea of what a cryptocurrency should be.\n\nHowever, what is surprising is the level of repudiation within the community. The Famous XRP Army is known to be a very closed and united group \u2014 and an overly bullish one, shall we add.\n\nThe crack inside the XRP Army began to spread out when Crypto Bitlord initiated a change.org petition to stop Ripple from \u201cdumping billions of XRP,\u201d causing a crash in the market.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ripple is the only cryptocurrency in the top 10 which is having a negative year-to-date performance in terms of price, which is perhaps also something that the community is struggling with.\n\nIt Will Keep Happening\n\nAlthough Ripple consciously decides to dump its own XRP the truth is that this particular transfer is inevitable.\n\nAfter Jed McCaleb left Ripple, the company signed an agreement in which they would periodically transfer XRP to a specific wallet owned by McCaleb for its contribution to the existence of the project.\n\nBut, fear not. The agreement also prevents McCaleb from just \u201cdumping\u201d XRP. Among the restrictions, the leader of Stellar (XLM) cannot sell:\n\n$10,000 per week during the first year\n\n$20,000 per week during the second, third and fourth years\n\n750 million XRP per year for the fifth and sixth years\n\n1 billion XRP per year for the seventh year\n\n2 billion XRP per year after the seventh year\n\nSo, perhaps the XRP Army can be more confident about the way Stellar handles XRP than Ripple\u2019s way of doing businesses\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "It seems that everything is worse during bad times and a new Ripple movement has unleashed the wrath of the XRP Army... again An alert issued by the", "authors": ["George Georgiev", "View All Posts George Georgiev", "About The Author", "Georgi Georgiev Is A Seasoned Writer With Over Two Years Of Experience Writing About Blockchain", "Cryptocurrencies.
