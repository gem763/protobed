But the department said it will not be providing further information on the victims, including age, sex and county of residence.\n\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak: Second death confirmed\n\n\"While some cases are continuing to be identified, no cases linked to the outbreak had a symptom onset date more than two weeks after the end of the fair,\" the department emphasized.
