Whether he is throwing a body kick or doubling up on right hands to get an angle, the ten-year pro makes it difficult for his contemporaries to digest the pressure.\n\nIn his last outing, Weidman demonstrated a much more educated left hand, utilizing it to either enter or exit out of exchanges. Unfortunately for the former champ, he still ultimately ended up on the wrong end of offense come the later rounds.\n\nIn fact, Weidman has been caught more often and with greater effect in recent history, getting dropped or stopped in his last five fights. Despite improvements to his head movement and hand positioning, Weidman has usually been a little too comfortable exchanging on the inside (for my liking, anyway), as his confidence here has seemingly gotten him caught consistently dating all the way back to his last couple of title defenses.\n\nI suspect Weidman\u2019s capacity to take a shot will be sturdier at 205 pounds, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll be looking to lean on that given his current counterpart.\n\nEnter Dominick Reyes.\n\nA former collegiate football player who fights out of a southpaw stance, Reyes brings in a host of well-rounded, physical attributes to compliment his skills. And despite his background and on-paper experience, the 29-year-old talent appears to have a natural feel for the striking arts.\n\nDisplaying a preternatural sense for range, Reyes uses pressure to draw out reactions. He has hard hooks and kicks that keep his opposition honest, but it\u2019s his pinpoint left cross that acts as a battering ram, both coming forward and off the counter.\n\nReyes also does well at varying his attack levels, going to the body or targeting the legs with regularity. Should the striking savvy that seems well-beyond his years stack up to the senior fighter, then perhaps Reyes can land similar shots that past Weidman opponents have had success with.\n\nHowever, if Reyes is too eager to retreat and concede space (as he\u2019s shown at times in the past), then he could end up inadvertently backing himself into the fence and inviting Weidman to test him in other ways.\n\nNext point of interest: Winning the wrestling", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the UFC on ESPN 6 main event between Dominick Reyes and Chris Weidman.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Head", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bd-ufc-on-espn-6.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
