He had a torch in one hand and a gun in the other. The policeman looked around suddenly wheeled about to shine the light on a window and shout: \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d\n\nBefore he finished speaking, Dean fired a single shot.\n\nOn the other side of the window, Jefferson, a 28-year-old African American woman who had been playing video games with her young nephew, collapsed and died.\n\n\u201cNone of it makes sense to me,\u201d said her brother, a US navy sailor.\n\nWithin 48 hours, Dean was arrested on a murder charge. Carr described that as a start but said Dean did not bear responsibility alone for yet another killing of an African American in their own home by a white police officer.\n\n\u201cHe really cannot be a scapegoat for what\u2019s happened,\u201d said Carr. \u201cYes, he\u2019s going to take his punishment but the system failed him. Whoever more senior was with him failed him. Whoever sent him out failed him. The training failed him.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Atatiana Jefferson. Photograph: AP\n\nJefferson\u2019s death has rocked a Texas city already attempting to shore up public confidence in a force responsible for killing seven people in recent months.\n\nAngry Fort Worth residents also drew parallels with a police shooting in Dallas \u2013 the killing of an unarmed black man, Botham Jean, in his own apartment by Amber Guyger, an officer who was convicted of murder earlier this month.\n\nPeople paying respects amid flowers laid outside Jefferson\u2019s house struggled to understand how officers responding to a neighbour asking for a \u201cwelfare check\u201d because he spotted an open door at 2am could have approached it like a crime scene, with guns drawn and failing to announce their presence, and then killed a woman in her own home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. In years past you would say this is an isolated incident but this is happening way too often by law enforcement,\u201d said Alvin Finkley, an African American forensic chemist who analyses seized drugs for the Dallas county police and lives in Fort Worth.\n\nThe killings of Jefferson and Jean followed the murder conviction last year of another white police officer, in Dallas county, for shooting an unarmed 15-year-old African American boy in the back of the head as he sat in the passenger seat of a car that failed to stop.\n\nBut if Fort Worth was rocked by the latest shooting, it was also caught off guard by the official response. The Republican mayor of Fort Worth, Betsy Price, swiftly denounced the shooting as unjustified. The city\u2019s police chief, Ed Kraus, responded with an unusual outpouring of emotion as he spoke of the need for his officers to \u201creact with a servant\u2019s heart instead of a warrior\u2019s heart\u201d. Less than 48 hours after the killing, Dean was arrested for murder.\n\nTo say it\u2019s only endemic to the Fort Worth police department ignores the reality State representative Harold Dutton\n\nFew in Texas would have predicted murder charges against police officers would even be laid until recently, let alone their conviction by juries.\n\nThe Jefferson family lawyer, Lee Merritt, said that for a brief moment he thought justice might be done.\n\n\u201cAs we learned that the officer who was responsible for her murder was arrested and charged, that was a positive moment where it seemed like the judicial system was acting a little differently,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see officers led away in handcuffs very often.\u201d\n\nBut the atmosphere quickly soured. Dean was released on bail within hours and it was revealed that the police interrogated Jefferson\u2019s eight-year-old nephew alone and then recorded that he said his aunt was pointing a gun at the window when she was shot. Merritt accused the police of laying the ground for Dean to claim self-defence.\n\nPoliticians and protesters said the circumstances of the shooting raised questions about the recruitment and training of police officers in Texas and beyond.\n\n\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d said the state representative Harold Dutton, a member of the Texas legislative black caucus. \u201cTo say it\u2019s only endemic to the Fort Worth police department ignores the reality of a system that has resulted in the deaths of so many all over this country. Unless we fix the system, we can be assured that we have many more deaths to come.\u201d\n\nThe police department has yet to explain how the neighbour\u2019s call to a non-emergency number asking for a patrol to check on Jefferson\u2019s house because of an open door became an \u201copen structure call\u201d by the time Dean and other officers were dispatched. That meant they treated the check as a suspected break-in and took a more confrontational approach.\n\nThe officers saw the open front door and looked into the living room. At no point did they announce their presence. Not seeing anyone, Dean went into the back garden and, with his gun drawn, shone a torch in a window.\n\nThe police say Jefferson reached for her gun and pointed it at the window. Dean demanded she raise her hands, still without saying he was a police officer, and then a split second later shot her.\n\nFort Worth police chief: 'absolutely no excuse' for officer killing black woman Read more\n\nThe mayor and the police chief have both been careful to say that Jefferson had every right to pick up her gun if she felt threatened, and the failure was Dean\u2019s for not announcing who he was.\n\nThe state representative Nicole Collier, chair of the Texas legislature\u2019s criminal jurisprudence committee and vice-chair of the black caucus, said the shooting raised questions about the quality of police training, which often emphasizes an officer\u2019s safety over the welfare of the public.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, to become a cosmetologist is the same amount of time that it is to become a police officer,\u201d she said. \u201cBasic police officers take 720 hours but to become a cosmetologist is 1,000 hours.\u201d\n\n\u2018So many families\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Flowers lie on the sidewalk in front of the house in Fort Worth where a police officer killed Atatiana Jefferson. Photograph: David Kent/AP\n\nAlex Piquero, a professor of criminology at the University of Texas, said that while he \u201cabsolutely understands why people are upset\u201d, he has found no evidence that there is a systematic issue with recruitment or a systematic problem of police officers being too quick to open fire in Texas or across the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any empirical evidence to demonstrate that recruits into policing are any worse than the recruits to any other profession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have doctors who lose their medical license. We have people in every profession who get fired or make mistakes on those jobs.\u201d\n\nThat was not how it was seen as anger poured out at a packed city council meeting the day after Dean\u2019s arrest. Amid chants of \u201cthis city is not safe\u201d, one speaker after another accused the council of inaction.\n\nAngela Darden told the council her brother, Jermaine, died of a heart attack as he was shot with a stun gun and held in a chokehold during a drug raid in 2013.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for so many families and I\u2019ve been saying this time and time again: that you people do not give a rat\u2019s ass about this city,\u201d she said.\n\nKraus, the police chief, stood at the back, listening without expression. One speaker, Ed Austin, turned to him and said: \u201cYou can\u2019t come to our communities and terrorize us no more. We will fight back.\u201d\n\nPressure had been building after a series of killings by the police in recent months, although Kelly Allen Gray, one of only two African American members of the city council, cautioned they were very different from the circumstances of Jefferson\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe had one shooting where someone took his ex-girlfriend and children hostage and then used a child as a shield as he fired upon police. So I don\u2019t think you can lump all these killings in together,\u201d she said.\n\nAllen Gray acknowledged the public anger but she was concerned that blanket vilification of the force would harm communities that rely on it for protection and hurt progress.\n\n\u201cThe police relationship with the community is not as broken and fractured as it once was,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIs it ever enough? No. But if I had to look back to when I first came on the council and I look at now, we have made really good strides. There are instances where you really want the police there. You want the police to show up.\u201d", "description": "The officer who shot Atatiana Jefferson was charged with murder \u2013 but as police killings continue across the country, communities say the system itself needs to change", "authors": ["Chris Mcgreal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e1b226287beb47eb494c5b572c96a445c0141f/0_0_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5424e2e1df517938854ccac80baccbdd", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
