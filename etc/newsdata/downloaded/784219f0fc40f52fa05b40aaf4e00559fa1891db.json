Women who lodged complaints against film mogul Harvey Weinstein, top Fox News hosts, and others have received financial settlements on the condition of strict confidentiality.\n\nFarrow reports that was also the case with Lauer\u2019s alleged victims at NBC, which the company doesn\u2019t necessarily deny.\n\n\u201cFollowing Lauer\u2019s firing, NBCU's legal team did an exhaustive investigation of available records and conducted dozens of interviews of past and present staff,\u201d NBC News Chairman Andy Lack wrote in a memo to staff Wednesday. \u201cThey uncovered no claims or settlements associated with allegations of inappropriate conduct by Lauer before he was fired. Only following his termination did NBCU reach agreements with two women who had come forward for the very first time, and those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose.\u201d\n\nThat last bit is crucial. While Nevils spoke extensively to Farrow about her experience with Lauer, she explicitly avoided criticisms of how the company responded to her complaint or subsequently discussed it in public.\n\nThat response came under fire as excerpts of Farrow\u2019s book began dribbling out this week. Top officials have repeatedly denied questions \u2014 including from inside NBC News \u2014 of whether they knew of Lauer\u2019s behavior before Nevils\u2019 complaint in November 2017.\n\nA junior employee at the time, she alleged that the star anchor forced her to have non-consensual anal sex in a Sochi hotel room while they were on assignment covering the 2014 Olympics. Lauer categorically denied the claim in an open letter published by Variety on Wednesday.\n\nNBC journalists pressed NBC News President Noah Oppenheim repeatedly on the rape accusation during a contentious editorial meeting on Thursday. According to a partial transcript of the conversation obtained by CNN, Oppenheim echoed Lack in saying that they used the term \u201csexual misconduct\u201d to \u201cmirror\u201d how Nevils\u2019 lawyer described the encounter immediately after Lauer\u2019s firing.\n\n\u201cOur first obligation when someone brings forward a complaint is to protect that person's confidentiality,\u201d Oppenheim said. \u201cThat confidentiality is not something that I am ever going to breach, not only for her sake. The whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however, she chooses to, and she is doing so now. I think that is appropriate.\u201d\n\nBut Nevils can\u2019t tell her full story on account of the NDA attached to her seven-figure settlement this past spring. In Farrow\u2019s book, due out Oct. 15, he reports that she finally signed the deal after a yearlong legal negotiation over the dollar amount and indecision about taking the money.\n\nNevils said the process left her with severe psychological trauma. But she told Farrow when he visited her home earlier this year \u2014 a scene he recreates in the book\u2019s final paragraphs \u2014 that she ultimately did the right thing.\n\n\u201cAs I prepared to leave, she looked me in the eye and repeated her answer to all my questions about the network,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201c\u2018I am obliged to tell you that I cannot disparage Andy Lack, or Noah Oppenheim, or any other employee of NBC News.\u2019\u201d\n\nCover: In this April 21, 2016, file photo, Matt Lauer, co-host of the NBC \"Today\" television program, appears on set in Rockefeller Plaza, in New York.
