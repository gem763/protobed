He makes the walk once a week, collecting plastic bottles from garbage cans and the streets along his way.\n\nGuayaquil produces 4 200 tons of waste a day, only 14 percent of which is recyclable.\n\n\"The city is full of corruption and dirty. Before it wasn't like this, it was cleaner,\" he said.\n\n'We need to be aware'\n\nThere's one glitch in the current system, though. The machines pay out cash in return for bottles, meaning there's no obligation to use the money on bus tickets.\n\nMetrovia manager Leopoldo Falquez told AFP that the company is working on that.\n\nNew machines are coming that will directly recharge bus passes, he said.\n\nSo far there's only one machine but there are plans for a dozen, all to be placed in bus terminals.\n\nTwo years ago the local government placed rules on the production, sale and import of single-use plastics such as bags and straws.\n\nEcuador's war against plastic has extended also to other parts of the country such as the capital Quito and the Galapagos Islands, a World Heritage Site archipelago several hundred kilometers to the west of the mainland.\n\nPlastics there have broken down into microparticles that have subsequently been swallowed by the unique fauna found nowhere else on the planet.\n\n\"We need to be aware of the level of pollution that we generate and the level of pollution we've accumulated, so the sooner we take more measures to counter this level of pollution, the better,\" Falquez said.\n\nIn the two months since the program was launched, more than 24 000 bottles have been collected.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
