I'm getting my endurance back, and I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail as soon as possible,' a muted Sanders said straight to the camera after thanking people for their support.\n\nThe oldest 2020 Democratic candidate suffered a heart attack October 1, and reemerged for the first time publicly on Tuesday, exactly a week after his visit to an urgent care center in Las Vegas.\n\nSanders, 78, has not provided a timeline for when he will return to the campaign trail, but told NBC News in his first interview since the medical issues that he plans to continue to run a 'vigorous campaign.'\n\nBernie Sanders appeared less enthusiastic than usual in his first video since his heart attack where he claimed he is 'getting my endurance back'\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Sanders told reporters outside his Vermont home that he realized he was more 'fatigued' than usual in the days leading up to the heart attack due to a strenuous campaign schedule and trove of rallies.\n\n'I misspoke the other day,' Sanders amended in his Wednesday interview with NBC, where he was joined by his wife Jane Sanders. 'I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it. We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.'\n\n'This particular campaign, we're taking on everybody,' Sanders said in his social media video message to supporters Thursday.\n\n'We're not only taking on Trump and the Republican establishment, we're not only taking on the Democratic establish, we're not only taking on Wall Street, the insurance companies and the drug companies, fossil fuel industry, military industrial complex, prison industrial complex, the corporate media,' he said in his reflective video. 'That's what we're taking on. But at the end of the day, if you're going to look yourself in the mirror and you're going to say, 'Look, I go around once, I have one life to live. What role do I want to play?'\n\nIt isn't clear when Sanders will return to the campaign, but it won't be much longer since he confirmed he will be attending the fourth Democratic debate in Columbus, Ohio on Tuesday.\n\n'I am feeling really good. I'm getting stronger everyday,' Sanders said at the conclusion of his video Thursday. 'We're going to be out there on the campaign trial, we're going to be in the debate in Columbus, Ohio next week.'\n\nPreviously, critics have pointed to Sanders' age as an issue, but his energy hasn't been an issue, until now.\n\nTrump refers to the progressive candidate as 'crazy Bernie,' likely in reference to his perceivably over-the-top demeanor. But the independent Vermont senator was more toned-down and less energetic than usual.\n\nSanders, who usually falls within the top three contenders in Democratic primary polls, also used the video as an opportunity to push for his Medicare for All proposal.\n\nSanders said Wednesday that he 'misspoke' when he said he was more fatigued than usual ahead of his heart attack. He was joined by his wife, Jane Sanders (right)\n\n'I thought about a lot of things, needless to say,' a reflective Sanders said of his time lying in a hospital bed in Las Vegas, Nevada. 'But one of the things that just went through my brain, is what would have happened if I did not have the good health insurance that I have?'\n\nSanders has BlueCross and BlueShield health coverage through his job in the Senate and is enrolled in Medicare, which U.S. citizens are eligible for after the age of 65.\n\nHe said someone without insurance who felt a pain in their chest, like he did last week, might hesitate to go to the doctor or hospital because they couldn't afford the medical bills.\n\nThis experience, Sanders says, makes him feel even more strongly that his campaign needs to continue its efforts to end the current healthcare system.\n\n'Yeah, I've had a rough week. I've suffered adversary, that's true, and I don't wish anybody to have a heart attack and get scared the way our family did,' Sanders added, going on to list other adversaries U.S. citizens are facing like homelessness, poverty, single-mothers making minimum wage and low-income households struggling to send children to college.\n\nSanders is also mourning the loss of his daughter-in-law Rain\u00e8 Riggs, who died Saturday, as Sanders was returning home from Las Vegas, at the age of 46.\n\nRiggs was married to the candidate's son Levi Sanders, and passed just two days after she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer \u2013 three weeks after falling ill.", "description": "Bernie Sanders reassured supporters in a video posted Thursday that he will soon return to the campaign trail following his heart attack earlier this month.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/19/19552468-0-image-a-4_1570730645756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
