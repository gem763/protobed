You do not deserve to breathe. I do not know what Ashley saw in you that was worth saving.\"\n\n(Image: WOODTV)\n\nChance, wearing a prison outfit as he stood in the dock, stared at the floor as he was scolded by his victim's mum.\n\nPointing to the box containing the ashes, Ms Young said: \u201cThis is what\u2019s left of my daughter.\n\n\u201cIf I want to hug my daughter I have to hug a box and close my eyes, because you chose to murder her\u2026 you chose to execute her, dismember her, scatter her remains.\n\n\u201cYou had no right to take her life.\u201d\n\nChance was convicted of murder, mutilation and evidence tampering following a trial in the US city of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nHe was jailed for 100 to 200 years.\n\nNo motive was presented by the prosecution during the trial.\n\nA judge called it \"the worst case I have ever been involved in\".\n\nPolice found Ashley's torso and limbs in the Chance's rented home, but they were unable to find her head, hands and feet.\n\nThe killer turned down a plea deal and other opportunities to reveal the location of the body parts, MLive.com reported.\n\nMs Young told Chance during her victim impact statement: \u201cYou will never tell me where she is because you like to torment people, you like to hurt them, you enjoy it.\n\n(Image: Grand Rapids Police)\n\n\"Because if you didn\u2019t, you would have told us. You would have told us a long damn time ago. You didn\u2019t. You are a coward.\u201d\n\nAshley was last seen when she visited Chance in the early morning hours of November 29 last year.\n\nThe pair had known each other for some time.\n\nWhen Ashley was missing, a frantic Ms Young had called Chance and left a voicemail saying: \u201cI\u2019m looking for my daughter.\n\n\u201cShe was last with you. Is she with you? You need to contact me and tell her I\u2019m going to contact the police department to do a missing-person.\n\nHe sent a text back reading \u201cOMG, I literally just talked to her\" and repeatedly told her that Ashley was okay.\n\nBut by then Ashley was already dead.\n\nThe cause of death was not determined, but prosecutors said Ashley could have been shot in the head or bludgeoned.\n\nDuring her victim impact statement, Ms Young blasted Chance for lying to her and giving her false hope, telling him: \u201cAshley was already dead and dismembered when you texted that to me.\"\n\nIn his statement to the court, Ashley's devastated father, Ambrose Gonude, told Chance: \u201cAll I can say is, may you rot in hell. You\u2019re nothing but a coward.\"\n\nMs Young said outside court that she wishes Chance could have been sentenced to death.\n\nMichigan abolished the death penalty in 1846.\n\nMs Young told reporters: \u201cHe has no right to continue to live. There should be the death penalty.\n\n\"Laws have to be changed. Things have to change. These people should not be allowed to just kill and keep going. They should all be dead.\u201d\n\nNeighbours reported the discovery of a body in Chance's basement after smelling a \"sewage-like\" odour.\n\nChance's parents James, 76, and Barbara, 63, are due to stand trial in January on charges of perjury and accessory after the fact in the case.", "description": "Kristine Young brought her daughter Ashley's ashes to court as she scolded killer Jared Chance before he was jailed", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Woodtv", "Grand Rapids Police"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558326.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-11-at-024652.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
