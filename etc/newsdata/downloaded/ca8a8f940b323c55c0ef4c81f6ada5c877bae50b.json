Ankara has already amassed thousands of Turkish troops along its border with Syria.\n\nReuters reported Saturday that Erdogan said military operations \u2014 both air and ground \u2014 taking place east of the Euphrates river in Syria, could begin any time.\n\nThe terror group ISIS, or the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014 and captured vast swathes of territory in the region in the ensuing years.\n\nThe U.S. supports Kurds in northern Syria that helped retake some of that territory, but Turkey has always rejected the legitimacy of the Kurdish presence in Syria. Turkey has long fought Kurdish forces within its own borders and regularly targets Kurdish groups in Iraq.\n\n\"Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial 'Caliphate' by the United States,\" the statement said.\n\n\u2014 CNBC Natasha Turak contributed to this report.", "description": "Turkey will be launching a planned military operation in northern Syria, and the United States will withdraw its troops in the area ahead of the attack, a statement from U.S. press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.", "authors": ["Joanna Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105521593-1540224670711gettyimages-1052684974.jpeg?v=1554871331", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
