Trump is not the one who is going to get scorched.\n\nImpeachment proceedings will very likely be so good for President Trump and so bad for Democrats that they might have to report them as an in-kind donation to his campaign.\n\nPerhaps the Democratic leadership thinks that this is a good way to raise money and to keep the base energized for next year\u2019s election.
