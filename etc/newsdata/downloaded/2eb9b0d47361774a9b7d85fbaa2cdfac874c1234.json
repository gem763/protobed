But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\u201d\n\nBiden could have taken responsibility for his comments and addressed the question directly, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he gave a rambling, nonsensical answer that included a reference to a record player. But, the response ended in yet another racial offense in which he seemed to suggest that black people lack the natural capacity to be good parents:\n\nWe bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t \u2014 they don\u2019t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the \u2014 the \u2014 make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school \u2014 a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n\nHis language belies a particular mind-set, one of a liberal of a particular vintage. On the issue of race, it is paternalistic and it pities, it sees deficiency in much the same way that the conservative does, but it responds as savior rather than with savagery. Better the former than the latter, surely, but the sensibility underlying the two positions is shockingly similar. It underscores that liberalism does not perfectly align with racial egalitarianism, regardless of rhetoric to the contrary.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden made a speech on race in Birmingham commemorating the 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church, in which he said on the issue of how racism and racial hatred affect black people:\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re not there yet. No one knows it better. My mom used to have an expression, \u2018You want to understand me, walk in my shoes a mile.\u2019 Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully, fully understand. No matter how hard we try. We\u2019re almost, we\u2019re almost at this next phase of progress in my view.\u201d\n\nProgress. That is the wall behind which white America hides, including white liberals. (Even many black leaders have absorbed and regurgitate the progress narrative.) It expects black people to swell and applaud at their effort. But, how is that a fair and legitimate expectation? Slavery, white supremacy and racism, are horrid, man-made constructs that should never have existed in the first place. Am I supposed to cheer the slow, creeping, centuries-long undoing of a thing that should never have been done?", "description": "No amount of growth or good intentions will change this fact.", "authors": ["Charles M.
