According to the police\u2019s annual report, 16 026 vehicle hijackings were reported. In the same period, the NPA managed to prosecute just 3% of that number. Only 382 convictions were secured \u2013amounting to 2.3% of the hijackings reported in that year.\n\nIn the past financial year, 22 431 people were robbed in their homes. In the same period, the NPA prosecuted only 1 602 home robbery cases. Only 1 045 convictions were secured, amounting to just 4.6% of the total number of crimes reported in the same period.\n\nAt business premises, 19 991 robberies were reported. Just 771 of alleged robbers ended up before a court in the financial period, of whom 601 were convicted. This amounts to about 3% of the total crimes reported in that period.\n\nLess than 20% of the estimated 21 000 cases of murder committed in the country annually end up in court.\n\nA total of 52 450 sexual offences were reported to the police in the past financial year. The NPA secured 4 724 convictions in this period.\n\nLast week, Batohi told MPs that it was understandable that people did not feel safe.\n\nThe country is busy losing the fight against organised crime. Shamila Batohi\n\n\u201cWe dare not applaud ourselves for the high conviction rate, while the prosecution rate is so low,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf it is true that crime is increasing, as the SAPS report shows, then the two departments have to come together to talk about the reasons why there are fewer corruption cases in the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cThe NPA also gets the feeling that the country is busy losing the fight against organised crime,\u201d Batohi told Parliament\u2019s portfolio committee on justice and correctional services.\n\nThe NPA\u2019s report suggests that the institution has been entirely hollowed out in respect of expertise and resources.\n\nNot a single prosecutor\u2019s post has been filled since 2016\n\nThe agency has just a handful of prosecutors left who are able to handle complex commercial cases.\n\nEven though the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) reported 293 cases of corruption and fraud at municipalities to the NPA, the prosecuting authority could only handle nine of them.\n\nNot a single prosecutor\u2019s post has been filled since 2016 because there is no money.\n\nThe NPA has 4 408 posts, of which 1 142 \u2013 or 25.9% \u2013 are currently vacant.\n\nThe personnel are also increasingly using the NPA\u2019s health and wellness programme because fewer employees have more work to do, according to the report.\n\nThe report emphasises the critical shortage of budgetary funding in the NPA, saying it had an overexpenditure of R77 million.\n\nMorale among prosecutors is low, the report warns.\n\nBatohi said the NPA was directing its focus on securing prosecutions in corruption cases in order to help restore investor confidence.\n\nIn the 2018/19 financial year, the NPA convicted only 210 state officials on corruption charges. It also managed to convict 17 people in the private sector of corruption involving more than R5 million.\n\nThe department of justice announced last week that it had appropriated R20 million for the NPA to enable the agency to acquire the services of four top advocates who would help secure the prosecutions of those involved in state capture.\n\nThe advocates are Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, Wim Trengove, Ngwako Maenetje and Geoff Budlender.", "description": "NPA head Shamila Batohi describes a criminal justice system buckling in the face of rising crime and dismally low prosecution rates.", "authors": ["Jeanne-Mari\u00e9 Versluis", "Jan De Lange"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/1225998366a04eb1b3a54e939bf77e17.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
