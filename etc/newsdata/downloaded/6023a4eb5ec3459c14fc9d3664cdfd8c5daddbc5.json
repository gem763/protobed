He touted the importance of building a solid team to stay informed.\n\n\u201cThe presidency is like drinking out of a fire hose \u2013 you can\u2019t absorb that information yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can make sure you have a team that is distilling info as effectively as possible so you can get a basic framework for what the problem is.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that\u2019s helpful is not watching TV or reading social media,\u201d he added, to laughter from the crowd. \u201cThose are two things I\u2019d advise, if you\u2019re president, not to do.\u201d\n\nThe criticism appears to be targeted at Trump, known for his Twitter diatribes and obsession with cable news channels and how they portray him. Trump tweeted 284 times a month over the last six months, the Hill reports, an increase from months past. Despite the increase in frequency, Trump is getting less engagement on his posts today, the report showed.\n\nSplunk\u2019s chief executive, Doug Merritt, said the company invited Obama, who is \u201ca bit of a data nerd\u201d, for insight on the rise of data and its uses. The company did not say how much it paid for Obama to speak. The former president\u2019s visit to San Francisco comes days after Trump\u2019s own stop in the Bay Area, where he raised campaign funds at a private event.\n\nObama said spending time on social media and focusing on how polls and media portray you can make it more difficult to run the country effectively.\n\n\u201cIt creates a lot of noise and clouds your judgment,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou start mistaking the intensity or passion of a small subset of people with a broader sense of how a country feels \u2013 it will sway your decision in an unhealthy way.\u201d\n\nThe comments mark a rare departure from Obama\u2019s typical strategy of keeping quiet about the current administration. Obama has tended to eschew politics for media, including American Factory, a documentary he produced that was recently released on Netflix \u2013 and getting plenty of shuteye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting more sleep \u2013 so cheers to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a drug, it\u2019s magical.\u201d\n\nThe former president also discussed misinformation campaigns, problems technology can solve, basketball, and his recent meeting with the young climate activist Greta Thunberg, whom he called \u201cfascinating\u201d.\n\nBefore wrapping up, Obama had another warning about social media\u2019s impact. He said he was concerned about the division and polarization he thought was \u201caccelerated\u201d by the platforms.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which everyone lives in a bubble of self-reinforcing hides and viewpoints, that\u2019s not healthy for democracies and not healthy between countries,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can understand each other, and we all have a set of common hopes and dreams and impulses we can recognize in each other. And our survival depends on that.\u201d", "description": "Former president also said TV should be avoided: \u2018Those are two things I\u2019d advise, if you\u2019re a good president, not to do\u2019", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f4a10e6efd084e76b8930a0b17196c12db0cec5/0_52_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2ecf9d5379dc35241dd68cae8db29472", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
