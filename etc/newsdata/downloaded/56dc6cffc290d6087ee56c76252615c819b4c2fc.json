(Kenzo Tribouillard, AFP)\n\nBelgium's advertising regulator said on Wednesday it has clocked up hundreds of complaints over a viral hamburger ad showing a comic-book version of a man punching a woman for handing him the wrong sandwich.\n\nConsumers and politicians called the online ad \"sickening\" and \"irresponsible\", saying it went directly against public campaigns denouncing domestic violence.\n\nThe ad, published on Facebook, aimed to publicise a Belgian hamburger brand, Bicky Burger.\n\nIts cartoon style borrowed from 1950s and 1960s American pop-art made famous by artist Roy Lichtenstein and by a panel from a 1965 comic showing Batman slapping his sidekick Robin that has been reworked into a long-running internet meme.\n\nThe Bicky Burger ad depicts a man in a suit swinging his fist to violently hit a buxom blonde woman carrying a fast-food container as he exclaims: \"Seriously, a fake Bicky?\"\n\nThe head of Belgium's regulatory Advertising Council, Sandrine Sepul, said the agency had received 300 complaints from the public in 24 hours.\n\nShe told AFP that a Dutch food company, Izico, commissioned the advertisement and her agency had transmitted the complaints to its counterpart in the Netherlands.\n\nIzico was ordered to explain itself, she said, adding that possible punishment could be decided \"in a few weeks\".\n\nBelgian media ran indignant reports on the controversy, which led to the ad being pulled from Facebook - but it was relayed thousands of times in individual social media posts.\n\nLe Soir newspaper asked how such an advertising campaign could be created in 2019 when, in Belgium, \"every 10 days a man kills his wife or his ex. And every day a number of women are humiliated, raped, beaten.\"\n\nTwo regional politicians in charge of gender equality for Brussels and for the Wallonia part of Belgium said they had also called on the country's Advertising Council to act.\n\nOne of them, Nawal Ben Hamou, said on her Facebook page she found the ad \"sickening and totally irresponsible\".\n\nThe other, Christie Morreale, echoed that in a tweet saying that \"using violence towards women in an ad is irresponsible\".", "description": "Belgium's advertising regulator says it has clocked up hundreds of complaints over a viral hamburger ad showing a comic-book version of a man punching a woman for handing him the wrong sandwich.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9456/604df5fb668c4d64a944c0ea37c6fcf2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
