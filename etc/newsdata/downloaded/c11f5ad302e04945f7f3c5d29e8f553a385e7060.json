(John Sonderman/Flickr)\n\nAlthough temperatures were still a good bit above our normal highs in the mid-70s today, drier air and more comfortable readings made it feel fairly pleasant. There was a nice breeze, to boot! We\u2019ve got another low humidity and warm day on the way Wednesday.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: With somewhat dry air in place, temperatures should fall relatively quickly through sunset. That feisty breeze we\u2019ve seen today will tend to weaken after dark, falling from around 10 to 15 mph early to 5 mph or so later. Skies will remain largely clear as lows range from the upper 50s to mid-60s in most spots.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): We\u2019ll wake up to lots of sun and that\u2019s the weather story through the day. Winds turn from today\u2019s northwest toward the west and south over time Wednesday. This will begin to bring more high heat and humidity back but not just yet. Highs head for the near-80-to-mid-80s zone.\n\nSee Matt Rogers\u2019s forecast through the weekend. And if you haven\u2019t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Mold spores are low/moderate. Other allergens are low.\n\nThe other side of the coin: It\u2019s about to heat up again in the East, but when it\u2019s hot here it\u2019s often the opposite out West. Cold conditions are expected in and around Seattle in addition to much of the northwest United States in the days ahead. Many places will be getting their first taste of winter.\n\nCooler weather expected this weekend with morning temperatures in the 40's and even 30's in spots early next week! Snow levels around 4,000-5,000 feet with a light dusting of snow possible on the grassy surfaces of higher passes. #WAwx pic.twitter.com/g2k0SfwqGL \u2014 NWS Seattle (@NWSSeattle) September 24, 2019\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
