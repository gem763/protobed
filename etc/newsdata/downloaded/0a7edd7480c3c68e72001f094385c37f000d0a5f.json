What\u2019s wrong, in other words, with being fond of one\u2019s mother?\n\nLet\u2019s hear what some wives and girlfriends have to say. \u201cMy husband loves fried chicken, so I cooked it for him,\u201d says a 32-year-old housewife. \u201c\u2018Not like mom\u2019s,\u2019 he said. \u2018Get her to teach you.\u2019\u201d Naturally, the woman saw red. \u201cI never made it for him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend,\u201d says a 26-year-old receptionist, \u201cdidn\u2019t buy me a birthday present \u2013 said he had no money. And yet that same month he bought a birthday present for his mother! \u2018Mom comes first,\u2019 he said. Honestly, it made my flesh crawl.\u201d\n\nHurt feelings in both cases are understandable. Is that the whole story? Spa! canvasses some men for their point of view.\n\n\u201cPeople say I have a mazakon because I enjoy going out for an evening with my mother,\u201d fumes a 38-year-old banker. \u201cAnd yet when a woman goes shopping with her father, no one thinks anything of it.\u201d\n\nOr this, from a 41-year-old management consultant: \u201cMy mother\u2019s getting old, and she lives alone, so once a week I drop in to check up on her \u2013 to my wife\u2019s disgust. I want to show my mother kindness while I can. What\u2019s mazakon about that?\u201d\n\nWell, it\u2019s a long story, and rather a complex one, as Spa! tells it. The boy growing up unable to tear himself away from the maternal breast is a familiar theme \u2013 characteristic in particular, says sociologist Toshiyuki Tanaka, of a male-dominated society like Japan\u2019s. Boys raised by mothers who sacrifice themselves for their sons may well feel they have a debt to repay as men. Wives\u2019 and girlfriends\u2019 resentment may stem from a suspicion their husbands and boyfriends want the same overprotective, unconditional love from them. \u201cForget it!\u201d they\u2019re saying, in effect. It\u2019s a new era, the ideal mother of former times no longer exists, and men who expect to be mothered all their lives need a sharp lesson in female self-assertion.\n\nOn the other hand, says writer Takayuki Kiyoda, the more women advance in society the more they may unwittingly stimulate the mother complex \u2013 at least in men inclined that way. Denied motherly affection by their wives, they\u2019ll take it where it\u2019s offered \u2013 at mother\u2019s house.\n\nAnd yet, Spa! finds, even women have mixed feelings about this. Tanaka, the sociologist, says wives and girlfriends may have deep misgivings about husbands and boyfriends who are rude to or neglectful of their mothers. It suggests inconstancy: \u201cI\u2019ll love you as long as you are useful to me, then I\u2019ll dispose of you.\u201d A man who disposes of his mother today may give his partner the same treatment tomorrow.
