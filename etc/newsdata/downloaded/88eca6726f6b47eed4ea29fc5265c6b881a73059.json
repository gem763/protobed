This year at Disrupt Berlin, we\u2019re going to help you solve that problem. We\u2019ve invited a panel of experts to tear down real pitchdecks live on stage, to help any founder in the room learn about the right way to tell a startup\u2019s story.\n\nIf you\u2019re attending, you can apply to have your pitchdeck chosen for the stage \u2014 just fill out this form.\n\nWe had a packed house for the first teardown we did, at Disrupt SF this year. We\u2019re excited to bring it to you. Investors on stage will include Sitar Teli, a London-based cofounder and managing partner at Connect Ventures, who has helped make more than 40 investments across Europe including Fiit, Kheiron, Citymapper, Typeform, OurPath, and Soldo, and Karen Stafford, a Berlin-based director at Intel Capital who focuses on European startups and has invested in companies including iZettle, dataArtisans, Elmodis and Volocopter.\n\nAlso joining us will be Russ Heddleston, the founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Docsend, a document management company that helps thousands of founders in Silicon Valley and around the world track things like how investors are responding to their decks. By collaborating with his users, Heddleston and his company have gained new insights into major trends in what works (and what doesn\u2019t) in venture funding pitches \u2014 like what time of year is actually best for pitching. Check out his articles on TechCrunch for more.\n\nTo have your deck considered, just fill out this form. If the panel picks yours to tear down, we\u2019ll provide you with a free ticket to any TechCrunch event in 2020.\n\nDisrupt Berlin runs December 11 and December 12. Tickets are available right here!", "description": "Having trouble pitching your startup to investors? This year at Disrupt Berlin, we\u2019re going to help you solve that problem.
