(AP) - Brutal. Atrocious. As bad as you can get.\n\nNew York Jets coach Adam Gase had plenty of ways to describe the team\u2019s 30-14 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday, and few solutions to the problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to look at over the bye week,\u201d he said after his offense was shut out by the defending Super Bowl champions. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d say \u2018Week 4 bye week, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s here.\u2019 But we\u2019ve got a lot of things to address.\u201d\n\nHow bad was the Jets offense?\n\nThey crossed midfield only once, on the first drive, when they made it to the New England 49 before the first of six consecutive punts - every full possession in the first half. They only broke the streak when third-string quarterback Luke Falk threw an interception to open the third quarter.\n\nThey went 0 for 12 on third-down conversions, with half of them coming from third-and-10 or longer; they failed to convert on their only fourth-down attempt as well. The good news, of sorts: They covered the 21-point spread, thanks to one touchdown on defense and one on special teams.\n\n\u201cOffensively, we were atrocious. As bad as you can get,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get any positive plays going.\u201d\n\nThe Jets have next week off before facing the Eagles, Cowboys and Patriots again. No. 1 quarterback Sam Darnold, who has missed the last two games with mononucleosis, has said he hopes to be back for the game against Philadelphia.\n\nBackup Trevor Siemian started last week\u2019s 23-3 loss to Cleveland, but lasted only one full quarter before he was lost for the season with ligament damage in his ankle. Falk completed 20 of 25 passes for 198 yards against the Browns, and there was hope that after a full week of snaps with the first-team offense he might be even better.\n\nBut the New England defense put an end to that.\n\nFalk completed 12 of 22 passes for 98 yards, and also threw an interception that defensive back Devin McCourty had time to wait under . New York\u2019s other touchdown came when New England punt returner Gunner Olszewski muffed a punt and Arthur Maulet recovered it in the end zone.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard lesson to learn,\u201d Falk said. \u201cWhen playing a team like that, you can\u2019t have errors.\u201d\n\nThe Jets were also missing linebackers Jordan Jenkins (calf) and C.J. Mosley (groin), along with defensive lineman Quinnen Williams (ankle) and receiver Demaryius Thomas (hamstring).\n\nGase said he wasn\u2019t worried about his team\u2019s morale.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good group of guys. You don\u2019t have to worry about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I am worried about. \u2026 You know, as far as personality-wise goes, they are all going to fight together. If you were in that locker room after the game, you would understand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Brutal.
