The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\u2019s Gerry Dulac reported that operator error was to blame.\n\nA scary moment as Steelers' QB Mason Rudolph was knocked out by this hit. The in-stadium medical cart was broken and Rudolph inexplicably was walked off the field. (Getty Images)\n\nThe NFL later released a statement claiming that a second cart was available to take Rudolph off the field, though that it wasn\u2019t necessary to do so.\n\n\u201cA cart was brought on the field in the event it was needed,\u201d the league said in a statement, via the NFL Network\u2019s Ian Rapoport. \u201cAfter evaluating the player, medical staff determined a cart was not necessary in this instance. Had one been needed, there was a backup cart on the other sideline which was immediately available. He received appropriate medical care per gameday protocols, and is now in the concussion protocol.\u201d\n\nAre we serious? The Steelers as an organization are worth over $2 billion and couldn\u2019t figure out how to get a medical cart working during a serious situation?\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond that, what the hell were medical staff thinking? Regardless of Rudolph telling teammates \u201cI\u2019m alright\u201d as he went off, he clearly was not all right. Where was a stretcher? Where was a spine board? There\u2019s an ambulance inside every stadium during games.\n\nHopefully the NFL Players Association, which is supposed to have the best interest of players at its central mission, raises a huge fuss over what just happened in Pittsburgh.\n\nRudolph missed the remainder of the game with a concussion and was later taken to a local hospital. ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported that Rudolph was later released Sunday evening and is in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The NFLPA should be furious.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tzPoM4IbKTmdtmKwDR4p1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MzguNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dyZbifNdMHayW5NPu4SQSA--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d031cf90-e86f-11e9-bcf7-bd4d011437ca", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
