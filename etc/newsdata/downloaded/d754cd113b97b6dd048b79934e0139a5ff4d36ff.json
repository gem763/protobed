It's quite a story!'\n\nThe aircraft were among four helicopters at the centre of an international diplomatic scandal involving Papua New Guinea, known as the Sandline Affair\n\nAt one stage, the Mil Mi-24 Hind choppers were destined for a new home at Darwin Aviation Museum to go on public display.\n\n'Where else in Australia, at that time, could you go and see two notorious Russian attack helicopters up close?' NT Aviation Historical Society president Tony Simons told the ABC.\n\nBut the plans never came to fruition after asbestos was found in both aircraft, which deteriorated over time.\n\nDaily Mail Australia contacted the Department of Defence and City of Darwin Council for further comment.\n\nThe Russians gunship helicopters have been around since 1972 and reach a top speed of 335 km/h.", "description": "The mystery surrounding  two Russian-built attack aircraft at the centre of an international diplomatic scandal two decades ago has been resolved after they were found at a Darwin landfill facility.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/05/20312410-0-image-a-39_1572326865756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
