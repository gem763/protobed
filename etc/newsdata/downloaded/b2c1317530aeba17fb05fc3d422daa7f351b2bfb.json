We will never declare a ceasefire,\" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters after a visit to Baku.\n\n\"They are pressuring us to stop the operation. They are announcing sanctions. Our goal is clear. We are not worried about any sanctions.\"\n\nErdogan said an attack from Manbij that killed one Turkish soldier was launched by Syrian government forces.\n\nReuters journalists accompanied Syrian government forces who entered the centre of Manbij, a flashpoint where U.S. troops had previously conducted joint patrols with Turkey.\n\nRussian and Syrian flags were flying from a building on the city outskirts and from a convoy of military vehicles.\n\nRussia's Interfax news agency, citing Moscow's Defence Ministry, said later that Syrian forces had taken control of an area of more than 1,000 square km (386 miles) around Manbij, including Tabqa military airfield.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected decision to withhold protection from Syria's Kurds after a phone call with Erdogan a week ago swiftly upended five years of U.S. policy on Syria.\n\nAs well as clearing the way for the Turkish incursion, the U.S. withdrawal gives a free hand to Washington's adversaries in the world's deadliest ongoing war, namely Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies.\n\nThe Syrian army deployments into Kurdish-held territory amount to a victory for Assad and Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swathe of Syria that had been beyond their grasp through much of its eight-year-old war.\n\nThe United States announced on Sunday it was withdrawing its entire force of 1,000 troops from northern Syria. Its former Kurdish allies immediately forged a new alliance with Assad's government, inviting the army into towns across their territory.\n\nA Reuters cameraman on the Turkish frontier reported heavy bombardment on Tuesday morning of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain, where an SDF spokesman reported a battle going on.\n\nU.S. military aircraft carried out a \"show of force\" around the town of Kobani after Turkish-backed fighters came close to American forces, a U.S. official told Reuters. The Turkish-backed fighters dispersed after the show of force, the official said.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet Erdogan on Thursday in Ankara.\n\n\"Vice President Pence will reiterate President Trump's commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nAfter Trump announced a set of sanctions on Monday to punish Ankara, U.S. prosecutors hit Turkey with charges on the majority state-owned Halkbank for taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nA Turkish embassy official in Washington said the indictment did not contribute positively to the current state of U.S.-Turkey ties. Turkish and American officials had been in talks on the Halkbank case for at least a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE U.S. SANCTIONS PRESSURE\n\nA senior Trump administration official said Washington would threaten more sanctions to persuade Turkey to reach a ceasefire and halt its offensive.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump supporter who has nevertheless been highly critical of the president's troop withdrawal, said he would introduce a bill on Thursday to impose tougher sanctions on Turkey.\n\nThe measures announced on Monday - mainly a hike in steel tariffs and a pause in trade talks - were less robust than financial markets had anticipated, and Trump's critics derided them as too feeble to have an impact.\n\nThe Turkish lira, which had fallen on the expectation of tougher U.S. measures, recovered after the sanctions were announced, as did its bond and stock markets, with traders noting that Trump had spared Turkish banks.", "description": "Turkey vowed to press ahead with its offensive in northern Syria on Tuesday despite U.S. sanctions and growing calls for it to stop, while Syria's Russia-backed army moved on the key city of Manbij that was abandoned by U.S. forces.  \"They say 'declare a ceasefire'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kgW1v5lJ0PYyRKtXhvTHjA--~B/aD0yNDgzO3c9MzQwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/3f1ba090-ef53-11e9-9dd7-4d8dbc2edd22", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
