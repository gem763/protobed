The signs were confiscated by security.\n\n\"[They said] there's no foul language, no politics. I asked why not. They said, 'Don't give me a hard time,\" Wachs told the local ABC affiliate station.\n\nWachs said it was after he yelled \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d that they got ejected.\n\n\"I think it's a shameful, harsh reaction,\" he told WPVI-TV.\n\nPro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have demonstrated for months over fears of Beijing\u2019s increasing influence over the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nThe incident in Philly comes right on the heels of a pro-Hong Kong tweet from the Houston Rockets GM that sparked an international incident and an uncomfortable situation for the NBA, which has massive business interests in mainland China.\n\n\n\nDaryl Morey simply tweeted, then quickly deleted: \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d By Monday that tweet had sparked a standoff between China and the NBA, as the Chinese Basketball Association, Tencent Sports, and other brands dropped ties with Houston\u2019s franchise. The Rockets had previously been the most popular team with Chinese fans, who started following the franchise when it drafted star Yao Ming in 2002.\n\nREAD: One tweet from the Rockets\u2019 GM proved just how desperate the NBA is for China\u2019s money\n\nThe NBA has said it supports Morey\u2019s right to free speech while dancing around the issue of the protests in Hong Kong. There\u2019s a lot of money tied up in China.\n\n\"There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters Tuesday. \"There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.\u201d\n\nNBA events scheduled to take place in China this week have been cancelled and Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it won\u2019t air two preseason games scheduled to be played in the country.\n\nREAD: Blizzard's Hong Kong screw-up is officially an international incident\n\nAnd the NBA isn\u2019t the only sporting league dealing with outrage this week over how it has handled an issue with China. Activision Blizzard has come under fire after it suspended e-sports pro Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai for supporting Hong Kong protesters during a post-match interview.\n\nProminent U.S. politicians have gone after both the NBA and Blizzard, saying they\u2019ve buckled under Chinese pressure.\n\n\u201cBlizzard\u2019s decision to censor a player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests is part of a profoundly disturbing trend by American entities like the NBA bending over backward to appease the Chinese government,\u201d Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden told VICE. \u201cChina\u2019s repression of peaceful dissent is disgusting when it happens in China, but it is incredibly disturbing that American companies would willingly participate in the Chinese government\u2019s propaganda campaign.\"\n\nCover: Fans hold signs ahead of a an NBA exhibition basketball game between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions on Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Philadelphia.
