As a victim of sexual assault myself, I made both the song and video at a dark time in my life, my intention was to create something extremely defiant and provocative because I was angry and still hadn\u2019t processed the trauma that had occurred in my own life.\u2019\n\nAddressing the controversial title of the song, Gaga stated: \u2018The song is called Do What U Want (With My Body), I think it\u2019s clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time.\n\nI stand by anyone who has ever been the victim of sexual assault: pic.twitter.com/67sz4WpV3i \u2014 Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) January 10, 2019\n\n\u2018If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I\u2019d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state that I was in \u2013 or if therapy was not available to me or anyone in my situation \u2013 to seek help, and speak as openly and honestly as possible about what we\u2019ve been through.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHinting at her future plans to distance herself from the song, Gaga concluded: \u2018I intend to remove this song off of iTunes and other streaming platforms and will not be working with him again.\u2019\n\nThe song earned criticism long before the recent allegations against R Kelly surfaced.\n\nThe musicians performed the song together on Saturday Night Live at the time of its release and received criticism for the uncomfortable sexual nature of the performance, with Gaga straddling the disgraced singer on-stage.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
