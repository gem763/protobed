And a \"triple threat\" of developmental factors could send the country into an even longer contraction, according to a Nomura economist.\n\nThe three primary threats are a projected decline in the nation's population starting in 2032, a middle-income trap, and the US-China trade war.\n\nThe factors could wipe out China's manufacturing advantage and send multinational corporations to other nations for cheap labor, Nomura's Richard Koo wrote.\n\nVisit the Markets Insider homepage for more stories. China's economy is grinding to its slowest levels of growth in decades. The country's second-quarter growth of 6.2% was the slowest rate seen since it began reporting quarterly figures. The preliminary third-quarter estimate of 6% to 6.5% is the slowest ever forecast. Though global stock markets have stabilized and trade talks with the US have resumed after a two-month hiatus, China's economy faces trouble from several different sectors, Nomura Research Institute chief economist Richard Koo wrote in a Wednesday report. A large part of China's economic prowess comes from its ability to provide cheaper labor than other industrial nations at a massive scale. A \"triple threat of growth-attenuating factors\" could eliminate the country's manufacturing advantage and move critical foreign investment elsewhere, Koo wrote. Here are the three main threats Koo detailed, and how they could cripple China's economy. Markets Insider is looking for a panel of millennial investors.

This \"middle-income trap\" jeopardizes the country's low-cost labor market, as manufacturing interest leaves China for cheaper nations, Koo said. At current wage levels, China's return on capital for manufacturers is nearing levels seen in emerging manufacuring nations like Vietnam and Bangladesh. The US-China trade war could exacerbate this migration and bring \"huge negative implications for China.\" \"That, coupled with the hurdles faced by Chinese-made products in the US and other markets, suggests a meaningful decline in domestic investment is likely going forward,\" Koo wrote.\n\nA soon-to-be-declining population China Stringer Network/Reuters Demographic data showed China's working population shrinking at the start of the 2010s, and the trend projects a net decline in population starting as soon as 2032, Koo wrote. The combination of a middle-income trap and a looming population decline is \"extremely rare\" for a country of China's economic strength, the economist wrote. \"These two factors alone would pose a difficult challenge for any nation, and now China must also deal with the trade war initiated by the US president.\" With just 13 years before the projected pullback begins, the country should focus on developing its own intellectual property and pivot away from serving as \"the world's factory, Koo added.", "description": "China's preliminary third-quarter economic growth rate    is the slowest ever forecast.
