Trump also accused Tehran of being behind attacks on two oil tankers, which prompted the administration to deploy an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East.\n\nTehran responded by announcing that it would surpass the limit for uranium enrichment as agreed to in the nuclear deal that was created under the Obama administration. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal last year, but Iran had agreed to abide by the agreement's terms until earlier this year.\n\nThe Hill-HarrisX poll was conducted online between Oct. 21 and Oct. 22 among 1,001 registered voters. The margin of error for the full sampling is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "A large majority of voters \u2014 84 percent \u2014 are concerned about the prospect of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released on Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/iranflag_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
