Are you 100 percent, my brother? We were hot, baby ... we were hot. We were like fire. Nobody could stop us.\"\n\nDurant: \"I could. I was like Sub-Zero (laughing).\"\n\nIbaka: \"We may go to Game 7, but the way we were balling -- had confidence.\"\n\nDurant: \"Let's put it like this -- if ya'll go into a Game 7 with the two-time champs, you're not winning that game. You're not. Ya'll had to win in six, which ya'll did. But if I was out there, ya'll wouldn't have beat us at home.\"\n\nIbaka: \"We almost beat you guys in five, you know that right?\"\n\nDurant: \"Yeah. Game 6, ya'll almost lost anyway. Klay [Thompson] went out, and ya'll almost lost. So Game 6, we would have smacked ya'll at the crib. And then Game 7 -- I know for sure you could hear a pin drop in your locker room walking into that arena. Ya'll would have been so shook.\"\n\nIbaka: \"Yeah.\"\n\nDurant: \"So shook.\"\n\nIbaka: \"Yeah, you're right about that (laughter). But we were hot, so we the champs.\"\n\n[RELATED: Steph knows he has no room for error with Dubs this season]\n\nAwesome stuff.\n\nDurant didn't bring up the fact that he missed the first four games of the series, while Klay and Kevon Looney were sidelined for Game 3 in Oakland.\n\nI think we all can agree that if both teams were fully healthy from the start, Golden State wins the series in six games max.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut that's not how life works.\n\nFollow @DrewShiller on Twitter and Instagram\n\nProgramming Note: Get ready for the 2019-20 Warriors and Kings seasons with the NBA Tip-Off Show, streaming live on the MyTeams app at 1 p.m. PT on Tuesday, Oct. 22.
