I mean the angles and pictures are a bit bizarre tonight for some reason\"\n\n\"I don't quite know what it is but there's something wonky with the @ITVCorrie camera quality tonight,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"What is going on with the picture tonight? It's not good quality at all.\"\n\n\"Are they using a different camera or lens tonight on corrie, or do I need to go to specsavers,\" asked a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nCorrie viewers were also in hysterics tonight over some comical editing during the dark scenes.\n\nJust as Kirk Sutherland and Ken Barlow pulled a Christmas cracker - the action immediately cut to a fire extinguisher being smashed into a window.\n\nChristmas classic 'Silent Night' continued to play as the prison riot broke out and the violent inmates started smashing everything in their site.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOne viewer tweeted: \"Absolute LOL at Xmas music over a prison riot\"\n\n\"Can't take that riot seriously with the jolly christmas music playing,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"FFS, Christmas music and riot scenes. What has happened to this show? Awful!!\"\n\n\"The xmas music combined with a prison riot was extraordinary, \"added a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThe panicking guards ran away in fear for their safety, while cameras were destroyed and a fire was started in a cell.\n\nExcited Abe wanted to take David to the medical ward so that Josh could \"get what's coming to him.\"\n\nBut David retreated back to his cell, claiming he could not cause trouble because he wanted to get back to his family at home.\n\nLater on, 'Sleigh Ride' was playing when Abe dragged a bloodied and beaten Josh into the cell.\n\nHanding David some scissors, Abe said: \"I bought you a present. No need to thank me. No CCTV. No guards.\"\n\nBegging for mercy, Josh cried out: \"I didn't do anything. It's all lies. I never touched anyone.\"\n\nWill David get revenge on Josh by killing him?\n\n*Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays on ITV at 7.30pm and 8.30pm", "description": "The explosive episode ended with David Platt being given the opportunity to kill rapist Josh Tucker - but viewers were distracted", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668752.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_18987JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
