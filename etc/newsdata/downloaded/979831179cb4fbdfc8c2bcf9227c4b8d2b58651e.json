Your first port of call for news in that vein should be our live blog which is already up and running.\n\nEU leaders have said they are ready to approve the agreement today at the leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels if the prime minister succeeds. Plans to publish a full legal text ahead of the summit were put on hold yesterday because of the unionists\u2019 objections. The prime minister is due to travel to Brussels and, if able to secure a deal, he would try to pass it through parliament on Saturday. He would need to rope in DUP support, along with up to 21 Tory rebels whom he ordered expelled from the party, and may have to resort to any Labour MPs who are prepared to give their backing.\n\n\u2018I will call you later\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump warned his counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u201cdon\u2019t be a fool\u201d and said history risked branding him a \u201cdevil\u201d in an extraordinary letter sent the day Turkey launched its incursion into north-eastern Syria. The bizarre presidential missive opens with \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d and closes with \u201cI will call you later\u201d. Trump wrote: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 1:12 'A very serious meltdown': top Democrats react to Trump meeting \u2013 video\n\nTwo-thirds of House Republicans have joined Democrats to support a House resolution condemning Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from territory where Kurdish fighters defeated Isis. The vote triggered what House speaker Nancy Pelosi described as \u201ca meltdown\u201d by the president when she and other members of Congress met with him in the White House. Democrats walked out in response to his tirade.\n\nGuardian\u2019s climate pledge \u2013 The Guardian Media Group has announced its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2030. This goal is part of a newly unveiled environmental pledge to continue our longstanding record of powerful environmental reporting. \u201cWe have always led the way in environmental reporting,\u201d writes Katharine Viner, the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, \u201cwhether it\u2019s covering air pollution or wildlife extinction, threats to the oceans or the human and social costs that rising temperatures bring. We\u2019ve already begun a full audit of emissions, and once we have the results we will work with the new staff sustainability forum to develop a detailed plan to achieve this goal.\u201d GMG also announces it is the first major international news organisation to become a B Corporation \u2013 businesses that use their profits and growth for a greater good and have a positive impact for their employees, communities and the environment. Viner continues: \u201cThrough our recently acquired B Corp status, which commits us to reducing our environmental impact as well as to high standards of governance and social impact, we will be transparent and accountable.\u201d\n\n\u2018Make BBC like Netflix\u2019 \u2013 Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has said she is \u201copen-minded\u201d about scrapping the BBC television licence fee and replacing it with a Netflix-style subscription. \u201cThe licence fee last year raised \u00a33.7bn for the BBC,\u201d she told MPs\u2019 digital, culture, media and sport committee. \u201cThey obviously have other sources of income as well. So I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.\u201d Her comments will boost the hopes of anti-BBC Tories, and scrapping the licence fee was recently raised by the rightwing Institute for Economic Affairs thinktank. Sources in her department later suggested it would not be a priority for Morgan and pointed out the government has committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC until 2027.\n\nBanks shamed over Saudi oil float \u2013 Environmental groups have warned banks linked to Saudi Aramco\u2019s planned market float that they risk financing the destruction of the planet. Saudi Arabia\u2019s state oil company has reportedly hired major banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and HSBC to help arrange its $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) market debut. Eight green groups including Friends of the Earth say it will be a huge infusion of capital for the fossil fuel industry, to benefit a regime with the \u201chorrendous human rights record of the Saudi regime\u201d including the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, and Saudi forces\u2019 involvement in airstrikes on civilians in Yemen. A Guardian investigation has revealed Saudi Aramco is the biggest single contributor to the global climate crisis, producing around 4.4% of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide and methane emissions since 1965.\n\nAnts in a hurry \u2013 The Saharan silver ant has been clocked by researchers as the fastest ant in the world, blazing through the speed trap at the scaled-down equivalent of 120mph and able to travel 108 times its body length in a second. Running flat out, with their gallops bringing all six legs off the ground at once, the ants can cover 85.5cm per second in 47 strides, more than 10 times Usain Bolt\u2019s stride rate.\n\nPlay Video 0:57 Footage shows world's fastest ants at top speed \u2013 video\n\nUnlike other desert creatures which shelter from the intense 60C noon heat, for Cataglyphis bombycina it is a prime time to scavenge. They emerge from their nests to feast on carcasses of less fortunate creatures that have succumbed to brutal temperatures. But even with their silvery hairs, which reflect the sun, they can barely survive the heat themselves and need all their speed and navigational skills to find food and return to the nest alive.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Will parliament accept Brexit deal?\n\nJennifer Rankin and Polly Toynbee discuss the dilemma facing MPs as the government edges towards a Brexit deal. Plus, Cara Reedy on what it means to be a person with dwarfism.\n\nToday in Focus Brexit deal a dilemma for MPs Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2019/10/16-71712-911017TIF_brexitdeal.mp3 00:00:00 00:25:29\n\nLunchtime read: Signal passed at danger\n\nOn 5 October 1999, two trains collided at speed in Ladbroke Grove, west London, killing both drivers and 29 passengers. Barrister Greg Treverton-Jones, who survived the crash and worked on the subsequent harrowing inquiry, pieced together what went wrong. A warning: this article contains graphic details.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scene of the Ladbroke Grove crash. Photograph: Toby Melville/PA\n\nSport\n\nEddie Jones has sprung a huge surprise by dropping George Ford and naming Owen Farrell at fly-half for England\u2019s Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Australia on Saturday. England\u2019s Maro Itoje has slammed this week\u2019s racist abuse in football as appalling and abysmal and warned that rugby union should not consider itself immune from similar problems.\n\nBoxer Patrick Day has died after he sustained head injuries in a fight on Saturday night against fellow American Charles Conwell. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs more time and respect at Manchester United, writes Rob Smyth, and the choice is simple: potential long-term success under the Norwegian or guaranteed long-term failure under a number of different managers. Professional women\u2019s golf in Europe is set to be afforded a timely boost after talks resumed over the LPGA Tour\u2019s proposed takeover of the Ladies European Tour. Despite a late strike that earned Atl\u00e9tico Madrid a precious away goal, and a draw in the Women\u2019s Champions League, the Manchester City manager, Nick Cushing, remained relaxed. And American golfer Lee Ann Walker was not aware that caddies no longer can stand behind players as they putt unless a player starts the stance over \u2013 and she paid a dear price, adding 58 penalty strokes at a Senior LPGA event.\n\nBusiness\n\nAsian stocks have barely moved after soft US retail sales data raised fears about the health of the world\u2019s largest economy, sucking the steam out of a five-session rally. Indices in South Korea, Australia and New Zealand were all in negative territory, Chinese shares were mostly flat, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei ticked up and US stock futures were barely changed. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was slightly higher with gains largely led by Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng. The pound is worth $1.282 and \u20ac1.157 at the moment while the FTSE is looking flat.\n\nThe papers\n\nWe\u2019ve got a full roundup of the front pages here \u2013 a summary follows.\n\nA photograph of Boris Johnson walking behind a metal fence, appearing as if he were behind bars, provided a visual metaphor too good for most publications to pass up and it is the lead image on most of the front pages. The Telegraph really pushes the image, its slightly baffling headline is: \u201cBrexit is like the Shawshank Redemption ... but now we can see the light\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Guardian front page, Thursday 17 October 2019.\n\nThe Express has: \u201cAgainst all odds, Boris closes in on Brexit deal\u201d, the Times reports: \u201cBrexit deal on knife edge as DUP blocks Johnson\u201d, the Mail says: \u201cIn sight of the summit\u201d, the Guardian has: \u201cJohnson in last-minute scramble for DUP backing\u201d, the Mirror goes with: \u201cBrexit on a knife-edge\u201d, the i\u2019s splash is: \u201cDeadlock on Brexit deal ahead of summit\u201d.\n\nIn other news \u2013 the FT reports: \u201cHargreaves Lansdown under fire as Woodford collapse traps clients\u201d and the Sun\u2019s splash is: \u201cEgo warriors\u201d, as it accuses celebrities who support Extinction Rebellion, including Benedict Cumberbatch and Steve Coogan, of having \u201chigh-carbon lifestyles\u201d.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.
