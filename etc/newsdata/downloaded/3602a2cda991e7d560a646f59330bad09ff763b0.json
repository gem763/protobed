Going up against Bec Rawlings, who was hoping to use her Bare Knuckle FC success to jumpstart a stalled MMA career, Joanne dominated the fight before finishing things with a kneebar at 3:35 of the opening round at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.\n\nThat was an impressive enough debut, but then Joanne, who had a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d themed walkout and is nicknamed \u201cArya Stark,\u201d busted out her gimmick: A \u201ckill list\u201d in the 125-pound division.\n\nStark crossed out Rawlings\u2019 name, which left three more: Unbeaten young phenom Valerie Loureda, former UFC and Bellator title challenger Valerie Letourneau, and undisputed Bellator pound-for-pound women\u2019s best, flyweight champ Ilimi-Lei Macfarlane.\n\nWe see a lot of cringe-inducing attempts at talking smack in MMA, but this one was pretty cool. And if Friday night was any indication, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more names are eventually crossed off the list.\n\nCheck out Joanne\u2019s full list below:\n\n\u270d\ufe0f @IlaraJoanne has a list & a goal and she lays it out following her debut tonight at #Bellator231. pic.twitter.com/LniZ6GN0SM \u2014 Bellator MMA (@BellatorMMA) October 26, 2019\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
