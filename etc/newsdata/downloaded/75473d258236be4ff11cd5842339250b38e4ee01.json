And one of several failed initiatives I have incubated over the years was to teach the very rich how to enjoy themselves.\n\nMy simple idea was to say \u201cLook at me, follow me and do exactly what I do\u201d. The problem here was that my illustrative idea of a good time was some desultory tennis followed by a long lunch in the sunshine with attractive and amusing friends. \u201cAnd how much does that cost?\u201d someone asked. \u201cActually, not a lot\u201d I had to confess.\n\nSo, this week\u2019s \u201clucky\u201d \u00a3170m lottery winners have a big problem with their small fortune, for it is nowhere near enough to feel, in these inflationary days, rich. I mean, not seriously rich. Not when Killik, an investment advisor, warns that putting two 13 year-olds through private school will now cost precisely \u00a3905,600. And that, according to Coutts\u2019 Luxury Price Index, luxury inflation has risen by 2.9 per cent over the last year, with food and alcohol seeing the sharpest spikes.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say paths of indulgence are closed \u2013 even if your millions won\u2019t get you as far as they once did. Take the Gulfstream G650, a \u2018plane that will travel at nearly the speed-of-sound (at which point you can actually hear your cash burning) and has a range of 8,000 miles (so you can escape vengeful creditors). It costs $65m. There are currently two hundred customers anxious to save just 30 minutes on, say, a transatlantic journey \u2013 but our lottery winners could not realistically afford a Gulfstream. Instead, I would recommend one of the new generation VLJs (Very Light Jets), including the HondaJet and Cessna Citation M2. Or an Embraer Phenom at a mere $9m. At East Hampton airport you would be treated like a leper if deplaning from a VLJ, but nowadays you have to face-up to the fact that \u00a3170m is a tight budget.", "description": "There are few things more likely to be ruinous than schemes for personal enrichment.", "authors": ["Stephen Bayley", "Sophia Money-Coutts", "Shane Watson", "Robin Hough"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/goodlife/2019/10/09/170M-LEAD-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgCXocDQF5kP7s3jSjli3eCH0-jRUT4rHK8EgtaGoQwQ.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
