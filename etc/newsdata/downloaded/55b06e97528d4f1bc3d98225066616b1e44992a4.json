Several family members feel otherwise. They say he did the work, so he earned the credits. I feel his admittance was fraudulent so he should forfeit the credits.\n\nHe denies any involvement in his father\u2019s actions, but I question that. I haven\u2019t seen one of these kids admit they knew anything about what their parents were doing. Do you have any thoughts that could help resolve this family debate?\n\nAppalled Onlooker\n\nDear Onlooker,\n\nIt\u2019s rare that I receive emails about news stories, but I understand how this has caused a heated discussion within your family. This case involves a student, Adam Semprevivo. His father, Stephen Semprevivo, pleaded guilty to charges that he paid $400,000 to the Georgetown University tennis coach to help get his son admitted to the school. His son says he wasn\u2019t part of this scam and, as such, is suing Georgetown after being expelled. His lawyers argue that college officials should have had a stronger vetting process.\n\nHe usurped another student\u2019s place, but he also did something in the application process that no tennis player should ever do: He took his eye off the ball.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that these misrepresentations could have been easily verified and debunked before Georgetown formally admitted Semprevivo in April 2016, no one at Georgetown did so,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cIn fact, Semprevivo\u2019s high-school transcripts, on their face, reflect that Semprevivo\u2019s athletic endeavor of choice was basketball and that he received credit for his participation on the basketball team.\u201d The lawsuit reveals that his \u201cathletic endeavor of choice\u201d was basketball.\n\nAdam Semprevivo says he did not know about his father\u2019s scheme. Let\u2019s take him at his word. If he did not know about his father\u2019s scheme, he should still give up his place and his credits because (a) it was his responsibility to make sure everything he put his name to on the college application was accurate and true and (b) there is someone out there who did not get into Georgetown whose place he took. It\u2019s not ethical to take up a college place, knowing that it prevented a student who was legitimately qualified from taking up that place.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: America\u2019s educational system is an \u2018aristocracy posing as a meritocracy\u2019\n\nI\u2019m not convinced that he didn\u2019t know. Adam Semprevivo sent an email to Georgetown\u2019s former tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, drafted by William Singer, the college counselor who acted as a middle man for parents, with false statements about his tennis experience and wrote an entrance essay for Semprevivo that highlighted his non-existent tennis background, according to documents in the federal lawsuit. Adam Semprevivo\u2019s lawyer, David Kenner, said Singer took over the process. (Kenner and Adam Semprevivo did not respond to request for comment.)\n\nAlso see: Classism and elitism are alive and well in Corporate America\n\nThe college admissions scandal touched a raw nerve across America, revealing the dark underbelly of how wealthy families surreptitiously snag a place for their kids in Ivy League colleges. The accused parents allegedly broke the law, but there are plenty of legal ways that more affluent families have an edge, including sending their kids to private schooling, and paying for them to participate in expensive extra-curricular activities and sports that are often out of reach for millions of Americans. The college-admissions bribery scandal revealed outright cheating.\n\nThe college admissions scandal touched a raw nerve across America, revealing the dark underbelly of how wealthy families snag a place for their kids.\n\nAmericans care about this case and many were outraged by the hypocrisy and brass neck of people like Felicity Huffman, the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d actress, who paid $15,000 have someone else sit a college entrance exam in place of her daughter, while tweeting TWTR, -1.32% about the need to empower young women. (Huffman later said she felt \u201cunfathomable\u201d humiliation and shame.) Those who didn\u2019t get into the college of their choice, those who did and those who never had the opportunity or, indeed, the expectation to go to college felt personally connected to this scandal.\n\nOf course, the whole notion of \u201cfair and square\u201d is relative. As MarketWatch student-loan reporter Jillian Berman recently wrote, families could spend upwards of $200,000 preparing one child for college. That\u2019s assuming students attend private school, participate in at least four years of each of extracurricular activities including youth sports, music/language/sports lessons, a volunteer program abroad, and parents hire SAT tutors and independent consultants to help students prepare their college applications. But that\u2019s a question for another day.\n\nWhether or not Adam Semprevivo knew about his father\u2019s deceit, he should give up his place at Georgetown \u2014 and not look back. Life isn\u2019t fair. Bad stuff happens. Entitled people do entitled things. And good people do bad things. Sometimes, they even turn a blind eye to bad things and don\u2019t ask questions, even if something doesn\u2019t quite make sense. He usurped another student\u2019s place at Georgetown University. That is enough for him to get expelled. But he also did something during the application process that no tennis or basketball player should ever do: He took his eye off the ball.\n\nGeorgetown University sent MarketWatch the following statement:\n\n\u201cGeorgetown refrains from commenting on individual students in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. In 2017, Georgetown\u2019s Admissions Office discovered irregularities in the athletic credentials of two students who were being recruited to play tennis. Neither student was admitted. Georgetown immediately put former coach Gordon Ernst on leave, initiated an internal investigation, established a new policy concerning the recruitment of student athletes, implemented audits to check whether recruited student athletes are on team rosters, and asked Mr. Ernst to resign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe University was not aware of any alleged criminal activity or acceptance of bribes by Mr. Ernst until it was later contacted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The indictments filed by the U.S. Attorney this year named Georgetown and six other institutions as victims of fraud. The indictments included allegations that Mr. Ernst and several parents of Georgetown students were among many participants in a scheme that included the falsification of applications for admission and included evidence of student involvement.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast month, we informed two students of our intent to rescind their admission and dismiss them from Georgetown. Each student case was addressed individually and each student was given multiple opportunities to respond and provide information to the University. Our review focused on whether students knowingly provided false information to the University or whether they participated in improper activity during the admissions process.\u201d\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
