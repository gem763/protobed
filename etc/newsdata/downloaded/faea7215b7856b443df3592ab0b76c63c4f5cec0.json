It\u2019s not my favorite occasion, in part because I\u2019m a complete washout at creating costumes for my kids.\n\nI used to feel zero guilt about this \u2014 my older daughter wore the same hastily-purchased owl costume for three consecutive years, then her sister wore it. I was not swayed or inspired by a million Pinterest promises of \u201ceasy Halloween ideas,\u201d or shamed by other moms lovingly displaying their home-sewn Moana costumes on Instagram.\n\nBut these days I do feel guilty about not making my 6-year-old an amazing costume ... because she\u2019s making me feel guilty about it. Why are her friends\u2019 moms making them costumes, when I bought her vampire get-up on the internet? she asked. I couldn\u2019t answer her in a way she found satisfying.\n\nDeep down, I don\u2019t believe that putting a ton of effort into my kids\u2019 Halloween experience is a good use of my time \u2014 I\u2019m not crafty, and anything I might attempt to make would not be up to my older daughter\u2019s exacting standards . The weather is supposed to be miserable in much of the country on Halloween, so even if I did create an acceptable costume, it would be covered by a rain coat.\n\nStill, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m falling short. That\u2019s because guilt coming from your kids \u201cis the most difficult\u201d kind to deal with, said Dr. Pooja Lakshmin, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. It\u2019s more stealthily devastating than guilt coming from other parents or society at large, Dr. Lakshmin said.\n\nThe first thing you can do to manage guilt (costume-related or otherwise) is to acknowledge that it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel bad that your child is disappointed, while also recognizing that complaints from your kid don\u2019t mean you should do anything differently. \u201cGuilt doesn\u2019t have to be a compass,\u201d Dr. Lakshmin said. \u201cIt can be just a feeling that you feel. And it sucks,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t have to be a moral judgment on you or your behavior.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if I did force myself to make my child a subpar costume, she would probably sense the resentment simmering beneath that poorly-constructed vampire cape. \u201cSo much of what kids remember is less about the actual thing you\u2019re doing and more about how they feel when they\u2019re doing it with you,\u201d Dr. Lakshmin said. It\u2019s more important that I\u2019m present with her on Halloween, having fun and eating candy, Dr. Lakshmin explained, because that joyful family time is what she\u2019ll recall a year from now, rather than her disappointment about a store-bought costume.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to model good boundaries for your children \u2014 in fact, Dr. Lakshmin wrote an excellent piece for us about how saying \u201cno\u201d is self-care for parents. By saying \u201cno\u201d to some things, we\u2019re showing our children that we value our own time and interests, Dr. Lakshmin said. (One thing to note, though: If you have persistent, intense maternal guilt that is so extreme that it\u2019s your primary feeling, it may be time to check in with a mental health professional, as it could be a symptom of postpartum or clinically significant depression or anxiety.)\n\nI\u2019m lucky in that my daughter\u2019s best friend has a very crafty mother, who is willing to take my kid under her wing and teach her how to sew, so that someday she can make her own dang costume. The kicker? Her own daughter has very little interest in crafting. Maybe we should swap.\n\nWant More on Halloween?\n\nTiny Victories\n\nParenting can be a grind. Let\u2019s celebrate the tiny victories.\n\nGetting my 2-year-old to leave the day care playground is the hardest part of the post-work routine. So I told him that I got an emergency message that Roomba was stuck under the couch and we had to rescue him. It worked! Made me feel so smart. \u2014 Rebecca English, Washington, D.C.\n\nIf you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
