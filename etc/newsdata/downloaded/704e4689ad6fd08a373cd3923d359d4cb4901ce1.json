Nope. Nope. Nope,\u201d said Logan once he saw the goat in the bathroom and ran out of the house after he discovered Big Boy.\n\nTwo Ashland County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived on scene not long after and attempted to lure the goat, albeit unsuccessfully, from the Keathley residence using carrots, a dog bone and grass, according to AP. When their attempts didn\u2019t work, Big Boy was eventually grabbed by his horns and dragged outside where he was secured in a dog cage while he awaited his owner\u2019s arrival.\n\nJennifer Keathley was able to locate the owners after she put a message out on a local community Facebook page. The apologetic owner came forth later that same evening to collect Big Boy and loaded him onto a livestock trailer to take him home.\n\nAfter the break in the Keathley\u2019s discovered that their home insurance policy covers damage from deer and bears \u2013 but not goats.\n\nJenn Keathley/AP\n\nThe family tried to get rid of Big Boy\u2019s odor using carpet deodorant and urine neutralizer, according to AP. But the scent apparently still lingers.\n\nKeathley, however, took the incident in stride.\n\n\"There's all these awful stories in the world, people need this,\" said Keathley.", "description": "A goat who escaped from an Ohio farm ended up breaking into a family home and taking a nap in the bathroom.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Big-boy-goat-break-in-Haworth_hpMain_20191011-085450_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
