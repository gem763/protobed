Muhammad Ali\u2019s \u201crumble in the jungle\u201d defeat of George Foreman in Kinshasa in 1974 to regain his world heavyweight title comes to mind.\n\nEliud Kipchoge shatters two-hour barrier to crash into the mainstream Read more\n\nOthers astound with a seemingly impossible perfection such as Nadia Com\u0103neci\u2019s perfect 10 in gymnastics at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games.\n\nAnd then there are those that astonish by redefining one\u2019s perception of what it\u2019s possible for a human being to achieve.\n\nEliud Kipchoge\u2019s completion of a marathon in under two hours was one of those moments. Not so long ago, just the possibility of breaking the two-hour mark seemed beyond imagination. On Saturday, we were witness to that something beyond imagination.\n\nKipchoge\u2019s time is not an official record as it was not performed under competition conditions. That does not matter. All that matters is that he did it.\n\nIt was the equivalent of running 422 100m sprints one after the other, every one of them in 17.08 seconds. One can barely comprehend the willpower required. Or the self-belief. Or the imagination. And yet one can, because it is a human achievement.\n\nPlay Video 1:01 'Anything is possible': Eliud Kipchoge on his sub-two hour marathon record \u2013 video\n\nWhen Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile in 1954, it seemed just as miraculous. Forty-six days later, the Australian runner John Landy did it again. And since then, at least 1,400 people have run the mile in under four minutes.\n\nSomeone \u2013 probably Kipchoge himself \u2013 will break the two-hour marathon mark officially in competition. Someone will run faster than 1:59:40. But nothing will make his feat any less special. It is for such moments that we treasure sport. And it is in such moments that we marvel at human possibilities. As Kipchoge tweeted before his run: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the limits are, but I would like to go there.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "description": "Thanks to the Kenyan runner, breaking the two-hour marathon mark is no longer beyond the imagination", "authors": ["Kenan Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4d1b6269c04d08c9940b65fe2dc5c7183c9fc1/0_16_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a181cc0ac273e38a210205e256929c51", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
