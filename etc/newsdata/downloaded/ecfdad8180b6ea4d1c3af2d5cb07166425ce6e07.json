The Goal Accreditation Panel is an independent panel of experts made up of former referees, players and managers and has no affiliation with VAR. VAR and the panel used the same camera angles. However, VAR can only use the pictures available while the panel can consider celebrations and post-match interviews. The panel voted 2-1 in favour of Silva.\n\nSeemingly unaware of the consequence of his actions, David Silva told on field ref Graham Scott that he had touched the ball. Had he done so, the VAR could have ruled Sterling offside and disallowed the goal.\n\nVAR Jonathan Moss spent two and half minutes examining it. He couldn't confirm that Silva had touched it. The goal stood and was awarded to De Bruyne.\n\nHowever, after the game, in a unwitting act of disunity, the separate goal accreditation panel gave the goal to David Silva, thereby suggesting Moss had it wrong and David Silva's touch was clear.\n\nVilla manager Dean Smith agreed with the goals' panel. 'Back in the dressing room I see Silva scores it. Giving it [initially] to De Bruyne was probably a get out, because there's no doubt Silva goes away celebrating, which is the giveaway.\n\n'When he touches it Sterling is in an offside position and clearly impedes the goalkeeper.'\n\nGuardiola was less keen to comment. 'Speak with the referees please! Speak with the guys who create that system. We don't know exactly, we cannot review the image.\n\n'The image is from London and one guy there. Go and ask them and not me.'\n\nDe Bruyne whipped in the free-kick and it looked as though Silva touched the ball", "description": "ROB DRAPER AT THE ETIHAD STADIUM: On 64 minutes David Silva played a short corner which ended up with Kevin De Bruyne taking a strike at goal which beat Villa keeper Tom Heaton.", "authors": ["Rob Draper For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/19/20221804-0-image-a-5_1572113278554.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
