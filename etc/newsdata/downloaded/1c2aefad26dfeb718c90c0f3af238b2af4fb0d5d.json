Barnesy is the same and they continually earn the right to push their careers. That\u2019s a brilliant thing for anyone to look at.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cCertainly if I were a non-league player, I\u2019d be looking at them and thinking it can be done because those two are living proof.\u201d\n\nDyche revealed he tried to sign Vardy before he joined Leicester but could not match Fleetwood\u2019s \u00a31million asking price.\n\n\u201cWe were in for him but we were in for him for about \u00a32.50,\u201d he said, joking. \u201cWe offered \u00a32.97 and some bibs and some balls at the time. It was a lot of money, but the risk has paid off 10 fold or however many fold.\u201d\n\nVardy will return to action after being given a holiday by Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers following his wife Rebekah's on-going feud with Coleen Rooney.\n\nVardy's wife Rebekah has been embroiled in a furious online row with Wayne Rooney's wife after she accused her - or someone with access to her Instagram account - of leaking stories to the press.\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nThe sensational row has been dubbed 'Wagatha Christie' after Rooney's wife claimed she set a trap to unmask the culprit.\n\nFoxes boss Rodgers reflected: \u201cAll we ever offer is support to all the players and their families.\n\n\u201cI was aware of what went on last week. I had given Jamie a few extra days anyway to get away with his family and have a rest.\n\n\u201cI am sure it was a difficult week. But we are here to support him and his family if they need it.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Jamie earlier on in the week. He has trained fine and been great this week.\u201d", "description": "Boss says both players are 'living proof' of football dream after grafting their way up from non-league", "authors": ["David Anderson", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18896673.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BESTPIX-Burnley-FC-v-Southampton-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
