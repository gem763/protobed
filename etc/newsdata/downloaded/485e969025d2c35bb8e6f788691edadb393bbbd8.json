My own gut tells me it's not imminent.'\n\n'Of course there's a recession ahead,' Dimon said on a Tuesday morning call with reporters\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a JP Morgan spokesman tried to downplay Dimon's latest remarks.\n\n'He says there is always a recession coming, you just don't know when,' spokesman Joe Evangelisti told the Post. 'He is not predicting a recession any time soon.'\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump announced a tentative deal to end the trade war with China.\n\nTrump said on Friday that China had agreed to purchase $40 to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods in a first phase of an agreement.\n\nJPMorgan, the nation's largest bank by assets, said Tuesday that its consumer banking business reported a 5% rise in quarterly profits from a year ago.\n\nJPMorgan is one of four big Wall Street banks to report results Tuesday, along with Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.\n\nInvestors were looking to see how the nation's biggest banks fared last quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and fears that U.S. economic growth is slowing.\n\nJPMorgan stood out among the four big banks that reported on Tuesday, beating on nearly every metric this quarter. Its stock rose about 4% in afternoon trading on Tuesday.", "description": "'Of course there's a recession ahead,' Dimon said on a Tuesday morning call with reporters following the bank's third-quarter earnings report.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/20/19756558-0-image-a-14_1571169144452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
