Belgian police cooperated with their Monaco and British counterparts, leading to the arrest of the agent in Monaco.\n\nProsecutors did not reveal the agent\u2019s identity and said his assistant was arrested in the Liege area, in Belgium\u2019s Wallonia region. The agent is suspected of collecting undue commissions over players\u2019 transfers.\n\nBrussels federal prosecutor\u2019s office did not give details of the seven raids but said they are linked to a first wave of searches in April when Belgian police probed the offices of Anderlecht football club and the Belgian football association.\n\nThis case is not related to the massive corruption scandal that engulfed Belgian soccer last year when authorities carried out 57 police raids in the country and around Europe in a probe into financial fraud and match-fixing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police have arrested two people, including a player's agent, as part of an international money laundering and corruption investigation in soccer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
