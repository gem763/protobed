About Sentiment", "language": "en", "text": "It's been a while since we have discussed sentiment. For the past few weeks, most of the discussion has centered on how good the breadth of the market has been and the indicators that go along with it. Oh sure, we've discussed sentiment here and there, but not as a centerpiece, because it has been mostly either too bearish, as it was in late August, or it has been neutral, like on Monday.\n\nThat has begun to shift a bit of late. Let's begin with the Investors Intelligence bulls, which scooted right up to 53.8% this week. As a reminder, they were 10 points lower right around Labor Day, so this is a marked shift. It is also quite close to 55%. Once this indicator moves over 55%, I consider folks too complacent. Over 60% and they are giddy. So it is now possible that the Fed delivers something that makes the market rally, and next week we see the II bulls over 55%. That would make this the first intermediate-term indicator to get \"overbought.\"\n\nAs for the put/call ratio, while Monday's reading was really too high at 119% -- thus the rally on Tuesday, I suppose -- Tuesday saw the put/call ratio for indexes fall under 100% for the first time in a month. That's a long time to go without folks betting heavily on the upside for indexes, and now all of a sudden, after a rise to the old highs, they decide to, what? Bet on a breakout?\n\nIn any event, let's take a look at the 10-day moving average of the equity put/call ratio, since it ticked under 60% for the first time since July. There is a little bit of good news here. In 2019, it has taken an extended stay under 60% before it mattered to the market. In the spring (green circle) it took almost two months. In the summer, it was a bit quicker (purple circle) as it took a mere two weeks. Either way, this is the first foray down here, so it tells us there has been a sentiment shift in the last month.\n\nThe total put/call ratio has not yet fallen under 90%. It resides at 91% right now. When it gets close to 85% it has gotten too complacent. But here, too, we can see we've come a long way since mid-August, when the moving average line was up near 115%.\n\nI am going to keep a close eye on breadth as we go forward, since for the first time in quite some time breadth did not lead the rally on Tuesday. The S&P gained nearly 8 points and net breadth was not even positive 200. It has not yet changed any of the breadth indicators, but it is worth paying close attention, should breadth begin to diverge from the indexes.", "description": "It's starting to shift, so let's look at the Investors Intelligence bulls and some other key indicators.", "authors": ["Helene Meisler", "I Think We Need To Talk ...
