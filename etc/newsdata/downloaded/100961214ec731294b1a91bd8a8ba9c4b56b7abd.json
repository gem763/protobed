Armor Lux MoMA: This was designed for the 2017 \u201cIs Fashion Modern?\u201d exhibit at MoMA. It was a limited edition, and I tracked it down when I started working at the museum. It is a classic Armor Lux, but it has this single red stripe on the left sleeve and a MoMA logo button on the bottom-right corner.\n\n2. Agnes B.: I stole that out of my mom\u2019s closet during college. She must have gotten it in the \u201990s. I remember her wearing it while she gardened. Agn\u00e8s B. shirts can withstand a lot; they\u2019re fantastic.\n\n3. Uniqlo U: This one is from Christophe Lemaire\u2019s first Uniqlo U collection. I love how starchy it is \u2014 it\u2019s extremely structured. Kind of like wearing a box.\n\n4. Edith A. Miller: I got this one from a Steven Alan sample sale four or five years ago. It\u2019s ribbed and fits super-close to the body, which is a great, great look. I love it tucked into a pair of jeans that make your butt look really good.\n\n5. Saint James: This one has three-quarter sleeves, and is so feminine. The colors are saturated enough, and interesting enough, that I feel like I can wear it casually or dress it up and wear it to work with a white tennis skirt, which I guess is very American-flag-esque.\n\n6. Uniqlo: I actually have two long-sleeved Uniqlos. They were on sale and reminded me of the L.L. Bean shirts my mom used to order from a catalogue. They\u2019re faded but look authentically faded.\n\n7. Vince: I got this at a yard sale and now wear it to shop yard sales with my mom on Long Island. I leave it at her house there.\n\n8. Tagless: I got it at an Army-Navy store, and it\u2019s just perfect \u2014 the quintessential artist\u2019s shirt. It\u2019s extremely simple, Jean Seberg\u2013ish, boyish, but still very feminine. It looks great with a red lipstick, it\u2019s supercomfortable, and it\u2019s made of this perfect worn, thick cotton. The stripe is entirely uninterrupted and goes all the way up to the neck.\n\n9. Giuseppe: That one is a Salvation Army find, the one near Skidmore, my alma mater. The colors remind me of my grandmother\u2019s Florida condo.\n\n10. J.Galt: I actually bought this at Brandy Melville. It\u2019s like equal parts elastic, viscose, and cotton, so it literally bounces off your skin. It has that fake-vintage look the teens love. I got it my first year out of college and now just wear it to sleep. It\u2019s a good sleeping shirt because it\u2019s comfortable and makes your breasts look great.\n\n11. Armor Lux: It\u2019s the classic striped tee, a foundational piece in my collection.", "description": "We\u2019ve thoroughly investigated the striped shirt, from the question of how well it sells at popular New York stores to the theory behind particular brands\u2019 versions to the stripes that sent the Connecticut blog world into a tizzy.", "authors": ["Katy Schneider"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/12/magazine/stripes/bubi-canal-stripes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
