He was a world championship silver medalist the year before.\n\nThe AIU also says it has suspended Albert Rop, a Kenyan-born runner who competes for Bahrain and holds the Asian record in the 5,000 meters. He\u2019s accused of breaking so-called whereabouts rules requiring athletes to make themselves available for drug testing.\n\nThe world championships start Friday in Qatar.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Olympic champion in the hammer throw, Dilshod Nazarov, is out of the world championships over a failed doping test.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
