So far, polls show support rising for Trump\u2019s impeachment, yet the public remains ambivalent about actually removing him from office. And the GOP base remains solidly behind Trump, as do Republican lawmakers.\n\nFor Republicans, Trump\u2019s behavior is growing more unpredictable even as his reelection campaign moves forward, making it harder to defend the president even as their political futures are increasingly tied to his own. Trump\u2019s pullout from Syria, which has left the U.S.-allied Kurds to fend for themselves, has angered Republicans more than any action he\u2019s taken since assuming office in January 2017, rattling the GOP national security and foreign policy establishments to the core.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nHis rhetoric on the campaign trial is increasingly raw and uncensored. Trump said Pelosi was \"either really stupid or she's really lost it\" during a Minneapolis rally last week, while repeating fringe right-wing conspiracies centered on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). And even top Republicans will privately admit that the White House\u2019s blanket refusal to cooperate in any way with Democrats on the Ukraine probe challenges the fundamental power of Congress to oversee the executive branch.\n\nAt the heart of the impeachment inquiry is whether Trump withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting in exchange for Ukrainian officials investigating the Bidens. Trump has denied an explicit \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d yet the White House\u2019s own summary of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows Trump pressing the Ukrainians to move ahead with a Biden probe. Text messages released by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Kurt Volker also buttress the Democrats\u2019 case.\n\nWhile congressional investigators are unlikely to make much headway in their quest for documents from the White House, Democrats got a boost last Friday when Marie Yovanovitch, the ousted former ambassador to Ukraine, defied the Trump administration\u2019s non-cooperation strategy and testified to Congress under a subpoena. Her closed-door deposition has given new hope to Democrats that other current and former Trump officials may feel empowered to come speak to the committees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear we have plenty when it comes to the president\u2019s admission of a crime. The challenge we have is that the public has to be part of this. And you saw things significantly change after the revelation of the Trump-Ukraine call,\u201d said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.). \u201cWe have to proceed at a pace that helps the public understand why we feel a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nSo far, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other senior Republicans have attacked Democrats on procedural grounds, repeating the White House line that the probe is \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by Democrats angry over Trump\u2019s 2016 victory.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is different than anything else you do. You literally are changing the course of an election,\u201d said one senior GOP lawmaker.\n\nThe GOP has been ratcheting up pressure on Democrats to hold public hearings, formally vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry - as has been done in the past - and release the transcripts of their closed-door briefings, accusing Democrats of trying to shroud their impeachment investigation in secrecy.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is a strategy by Adam Schiff and the Democrats to have closed-door depositions in his bunker here in the basement of the United States Capitol, and then to cherry pick out facts that they think can be spun to best help make their case by also withholding other key facts,\u201d Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) told reporters Monday ahead of Hill\u2019s scheduled deposition.\n\n\n\nTrump and Republicans have seized on one text message that Sondland sent to another U.S. diplomat saying there were \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u201d with Ukraine. But the Washington Post reported that Sondland will testify this week that the president told him to deny that there was a quid pro quo, knee-capping one of the GOP\u2019s chief talking points.\n\nDemocrats have thus far resisted calls to formally vote on opening an impeachment inquiry, saying Republicans are just trying to distract from the substance of the allegations against Trump and pointing out it\u2019s not required by the constitution.\n\nAnother pressing issue for Democrats is securing testimony from the whistleblower who brought the entire Ukraine episode to light. Yet House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) signaled Sunday that the whistleblower may not even end up testifying, due to safety concerns. Some Democrats also believe they have enough evidence to move forward without the whistleblower. Trump has repeatedly called for the whistleblower\u2019s identity to be publicly revealed while demanding the right to question his accuser.\n\n\u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\u201d Schiff (D-Calif.) said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201c on Sunday. \u201cWe do want to make sure that we identify other evidence that is pertinent to the [investigation] \u2014 the withholding of the military support, the effort to cover this up by hiding this in a classified computer system.. It may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity to do that.\u201d\n\nDemocrats may also be tempted to expand the scope of their investigation as new revelations continue to pop up. But most members are preaching a tightly focused and disciplined message and appear to be coalescing around a limited number of articles of impeachment related to the Ukrainian scandal.\n\n\u201cI think their current stonewalling and obstruction almost compels us to have more than one article \u2013 not a laundry list, a small number of clear articles of impeachment, one of which I think will form around obstruction,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.).\n\nRepublicans will face their own set of challenges. GOP lawmakers \u2014 many of whom have avoided questions over the past two weeks about whether it was appropriate for Trump to solicit foreign assistance for political gain \u2014 will be confronted by reporters in the Capitol with the latest revelations in the Ukraine scandal.\n\nWhile lawmakers were at home with their constituents during the two week recess, Justice Department prosecutors arrested a pair of Giuliani associates who helped dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine and accused them of campaign finance violations. And Democrats released a trove of text messages between U.S. diplomats who were trying to secure a public commitment from Ukraine that it would look into the Biden family.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Republicans are fuming over Trump\u2019s decision to abandon a U.S. ally who offered invaluable aid in the fight against ISIS, a rare public rebuke of Trump by his own party.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) promised to move quickly on two legislative packages related to Syria. Democrats will move a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s action, a measure that is expected to pass on a party line vote.\n\nBut Engel and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), ranking member on Foreign Affairs, are planning a bipartisan bill to impose economic sanctions on Turkey. Top Republicans believe there will be an \u201coverwhelming vote\u201d on that package. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) are pushing a similar bill in the Senate.\n\n\n\nWith even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blasting Trump\u2019s move - although McConnell was careful to avoid criticizing Trump by name - the White House moved Monday to try to preempt the congressional backlash by imposing sanctions on Turkey on its own.\n\n\u201cThe United States will aggressively use economic sanctions to target those who enable, facilitate, and finance these heinous acts in Syria,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \"I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\u201d\n\nTrump said the U.S. government will target \u201cthose who may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a cease-fire, preventing displaced persons from returning home, forcibly repatriating refugees or threatening the peace, security or stability in Syria.\u201d\n\nTariffs on Turkish steel imports will be raised by 50 percent, and U.S. negotiators will abandon talks around a $100 bill trade package with Turkey. And Pence on Monday afternoon told reporters he\u2019ll travel to Turkey to \u201cbring violence to an end.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Syria decision has fueled speculation on Capitol Hill about whether the move will alienate Republicans and prod them into supporting impeachment.\n\nRetiring Rep. John Shimkus went so far as to say he no longer supports Trump after he pulled troops from Syria. But the Illinois Republican, however, hasn\u2019t backed the impeachment inquiry \u2014 despite saying he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the Ukraine call.\n\nHeather Caygle and Andrew Desiderio contributed.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/47/50/51aacfdf4bea9b2c57d73646f420/191014-trumo-frown-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
