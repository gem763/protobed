Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) continues to rise nationally and as Harris \u2014 and other candidates \u2014 struggle to dent the strength of former vice president Joe Biden in the polls. Many Democrats believed his support would start to fade, and his continued strength is leaving less room for other candidates to elbow their way into contention, forcing some to reconsider their approach.\n\nHarris\u2019s moves also come at a critical moment in the campaign calendar. Less than five months remain until voting begins \u2014 not much time for an assault on the commanding position of Biden, Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). The third-quarter fundraising period ends Sept. 30, and a weak showing could damage several of the hopefuls.\n\nFor Harris, the renewed Iowa focus suggests her strategists, who once felt she had many paths to the nomination, are seeing those options dwindle. South Carolina, for example, was initially viewed as a promising target for Harris, who could then use her momentum to vault into the rest of the primary season. But Biden holds a persistent lead in the state, where he benefits from the loyalty of many black voters.\n\nHarris\u2019s plan for frequent Iowa appearances will not preclude efforts in South Carolina, where she will also campaign this weekend. But it does represent a major pivot for Harris, who spent most of the last months crisscrossing the country to big-dollar fundraisers to the exclusion of more regular campaigning.\n\nAlthough her campaign was the first to buy television ads in Iowa and she staged a five-day bus tour there in August, Harris had not campaigned in Iowa in five weeks as of Thursday morning \u2014 a longer drought than any of the leading candidates.\n\nHarris, a senator from California, has also been scarce recently in other early primary states like New Hampshire, where she\u2019s appeared once in the last two months, and South Carolina, which she has not visited in more than two months.\n\nRodriguez said those omissions were strategic. The campaign, he said, believed the candidate should be fundraising rather than retail politicking so she could build the necessary resources to spread her message in Iowa and other early states.\n\nBut Harris has struggled to turn her attention-grabbing campaign launch into consistent momentum. Early on, campaign staff and advisers argued that her main problem was name identification, since fewer people knew her than Biden, Sanders or Warren. As soon as she got herself out on the campaign trail, they said, she\u2019d catch up in the polls.\n\nBut Harris has not been in front of early-state voters as much as the other candidates. And now Harris\u2019s donors are increasingly concerned about her prospects, while the campaign is seeking to dampen expectations for fundraising in the year\u2019s third quarter.\n\n\u201cShe has consistently been in the top four or five [in the polls], but with the acknowledgment that we\u2019ve got to get her out there more,\u201d said Harris communications director Lily Adams. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose of getting her out there in October, spending half the month or so in Iowa, making sure we\u2019re there every week.\u201d\n\nStill, a top-three finish in Iowa \u2014 let alone a nationwide comeback \u2014 will not come easily. An Iowa poll released this week, conducted by longtime Harris pollster David Binder for Focus on Rural America, found Harris at five percent in the state, trailing not only Biden, Warren and Sanders but also South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nThe poll showed Harris slipping 13 points from where she stood after staging an emotional attack on Biden in the first Democratic debate, after which Harris described herself as a \u201ctop-tier\u201d candidate.\n\nAsked on Thursday about that drop in polls, Adams said the campaign never believed the earlier polling spike would last, referring to it as \u201ca sugar high.\u201d\n\nBut the unspoken challenge \u2014 for Harris as well as other Democrats \u2014 is Biden\u2019s durability, as Harris advisers and allies acknowledge privately. Despite attacks from his rivals, multiple gaffes and questions about his age and record, Biden has maintained his spot atop virtually all state and national polls.\n\nHarris\u2019s advisers have long seen Biden as the rival she needs to beat, particularly when it comes to African American voters. But so far, she been unable to dislodge or put a visible dent in Biden\u2019s prospects in Iowa, South Carolina or elsewhere.\n\nHer campaign has demonstrated a belief \u2014 as evidenced in part by her strategy in the first two debates \u2014 that Harris can pry voters away from the former vice president, particularly if he falters. If he doesn\u2019t, she will not be the only 2020 hopeful whose path to the nomination will taper.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what their plan is to maintain that [durability],\u201d Adams said of Biden. \u201cOur strategy is going to be to get [Harris] out there more, and make sure that she\u2019s like right up in people\u2019s face when they\u2019re making that decision.\u201d\n\nEven so, Harris has faced ongoing questions about her central message and reason for running, something many voters have said she has not made as clear as some competitors have. While Biden, Warren and Sanders have long-established political identities \u2014 Biden pitching himself as a return to normalcy, Warren advocating \u201cstructural change\u201d and Sanders pushing a revolution \u2014 Harris entered the campaign without an easy-to-sum-up pitch, and has yet to establish one.\n\nIn the last debate, Harris often looked directly at the camera and challenged President Trump rather than her Democratic rivals, something her advisers say reflects her argument that the former California attorney general is the best candidate to \u201cprosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHarris has also touted \u2014 and spent her Iowa advertising dollars explaining \u2014 a \u201c3 a.m. agenda,\u201d her plan to address the issues \u201cthat keep Americans up at night.\u201d She\u2019s sought to position herself, between Biden on the one hand and the liberal Warren and Sanders on the other, as a \u201cproblem-solving\u201d candidate who favors big change but will take practical steps to achieve it.\n\nOn Thursday, Adams took not-so-veiled shots at those rivals.\n\n\u201cWe have, obviously, a candidate who\u2019s saying we should just look back to the way things were. But I think that going back is not usually how Democrats conducted campaigns,\u201d she said in a reference to Biden.\n\nOn the other hand, Adams said, \u201cI think there are far more ideological, strict ideological candidates who I believe will contribute to the partisan rancor that we\u2019ve seen and watched it for a long time.\u201d\n\nHarris intends to position herself between those two camps during the next stage of her campaign, beginning Thursday night in Coralville, Iowa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f---ing moving to Iowa,\u201d Harris told Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) on Wednesday, pithily summing up her strategy inadvertently within earshot of reporter Matt Laslo.\n\nThe question is how many voters in Iowa will move to her.", "description": "With her campaign struggling and Joe Biden maintaining his lead, Kamala Harris is gambling on a heavy focus on Iowa.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4GJEHG3BQI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
