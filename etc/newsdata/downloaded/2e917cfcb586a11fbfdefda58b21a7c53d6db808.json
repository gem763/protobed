And that\u2019s why you need to take on China.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump said he would consider striking an interim agreement to resolve the more than year-long trade war with Beijing until a more-permanent deal can be reached.\n\nBoth Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said they would keep the billions of dollars' worth of tariffs in place, if elected, for leverage in negotiations with China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would not repeal the tariffs on day one,\u201d Yang said. \u201cBut I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal.\u201d\n\nHe noted that imbalances between the world\u2019s two largest economies are real, but lambasted Trump\u2019s trade policy as \u201carbitrary.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, blamed \u201cgiant multinational corporations\u201d for the faulty policy. At the end of July, Warren rolled out a plan laying out a number of criteria, including environmental standards and labor rights, that countries would need to meet in order to order to be able to trade with the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur trade policy has been broken for decades,\u201d she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, slammed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blamed for the loss of 4 million, good-paying jobs, and took a dig at Biden, who supported its passage in 1993.\n\n\"People who had these jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50 percent of what they made in manufacturing,\" he said.\n\nThe decades-old trilateral trade agreement has also been a frequent target of Trump, who has criticized large trade deficits the U.S. has with Mexico and Canada, as well as the relocation of American jobs and companies.\n\nTrump forged a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico last year, aptly named the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, that included new key provisions governing the auto and dairy industries.\n\nU.S. goods and services trade with Canada totaled an estimated $544.9 billion in 2016, with a trade surplus of $11.2 billion.", "description": "The 2020 hopefuls differentiated on the best way to address the problems.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Dem-debate-night-3-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
