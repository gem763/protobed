Yet such a response hardly chimed with acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's aim in carrying out the procedure.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Franco's coffin was carried out of the mausoleum\n\nIn his statement after the exhumation at Madrid's vast Valley of the Fallen, Mr S\u00e1nchez described it as \"another step in the reconciliation\" of Spaniards, so many of whom had been divided into left and right by the civil war and ensuing dictatorship.\n\nYet the decision to move Franco's body to a quiet cemetery was always likely to provoke a fierce reaction from some quarters. And so it proved.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Franco supporters gathered outside the dictator's new resting place in Madrid's El Pardo neighbourhood\n\nA swastika pendant around his neck, Chema Quijada gathered with other Franco supporters at Mingorrubio cemetery to protest against the initiative.\n\n\"Ever since the transition [to democracy] until now, all the political parties have betrayed us,\" he said. \"They have falsified history. They don't want new generations to understand Spain's history.\"\n\nThere was also discontent on the left at how the government had managed the occasion, particularly the presence of Justice Minister Dolores Delgado at the exhumation as a legal witness.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There was anger that Justice Minister Dolores Delgado (R) attended the exhumation as a legal witness\n\n\"I don't fully understand what members of the government and other representatives of our democracy are doing, solemnly attending what is clearly a tribute to the dictator by his relatives and other fascists,\" tweeted Alberto Garz\u00f3n, leader of the United Left coalition.\n\nBut amid the misgivings about how the exhumation had been carried out, there was also strong support for it.\n\nNicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez Albornoz, a 93-year-old historian, felt relief at Franco's transfer from the Valley of the Fallen. As a young man he escaped from the site after being sent there to do forced labour.\n\n\"I don't see why a dictator of the group that included Hitler, Mussolini and others had to be buried in Spain in a monument,\" he said. \"I have been feeling shame all this time.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Historian Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez Albornoz was sent to do forced labour at the Valley of the Fallen when he was young\n\nHe added: \"It's about time.\"\n\nYet many of those who followed events live on television in bars and homes across Spain on Thursday did not feel nearly as strongly as either S\u00e1nchez Albornoz or the pro-Franco demonstrators.\n\nA recent poll published by El Mundo showed that only 24% of people were \"not at all in agreement\" with the exhumation, while 32% were \"totally in agreement\".\n\nThe remainder either felt not very strongly about it, or even had no opinion on the matter.\n\nIt is still not clear how the government will repurpose the Valley of the Fallen now that Franco has been removed from it.\n\nBut for historical memory campaigners there are other major pending issues: the prosecution of Franco-era officials suspected of human rights abuses who are protected by an amnesty law; and the more than 100,000 unmarked graves across the country still containing Franco's victims.\n\nIt could be that the S\u00e1nchez administration, rather than simply riling the far-right by exhuming the country's dictator, has raised the expectations of many others.", "description": "Monuments are defaced after the transfer of General Franco's remains from a mausoleum to a cemetery.", "authors": ["Guy Hedgecoe"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13DAE/production/_109362318_057519930-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
