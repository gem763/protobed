He headed the back of my head and he broke his nose. I didn\u2019t know I had done it until the next day when it was all over the papers. I was getting a lot of messages with people thinking I had meant to do it! It was mostly light-hearted, a lot of banter. I got back to school and people were asking about it. I was in year 10 or 11 and my mates had all seen it.\u201d\u200b\n\nGiven Costa\u2019s infamous temper, Tomori might have been watching his back when the pair returned to the training pitch, but he added: \u201cIt was all right. He didn\u2019t kick me in training after that.\u201d\u200b", "description": "Fikayo Tomori was still at school when he broke Diego Costa\u2019s nose on the Chelsea training pitch and the club\u2019s latest Academy graduate to win an England call-up has since proved he is a fast learner.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Jim White", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000211831366-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6BstALpMiKOXM0sIUAWNCPiFVleuY0pDaktL2sQ0gmQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
