Sayed said that after the surgery, Beale described the operation as a success.\n\nHowever, shortly after Munshi said he thought Zayyaan had a collapsed lung, but still let Beale leave. Not long after, Munshi rushed Sayed into the recovery area where his disorientated son was kicking and moaning with half-opened eyes.\n\nThe father was apparently told to hold his son's legs while Munshi unsuccessfully tried to get a tube into his chest. Mohammadh said it was unacceptable that a parent was asked to assist a doctor in the resuscitation of his child, and wanted justice.\n\nBeale arrived back at the hospital after 20:30 when Zayyan was in ICU where he died after 22:00 after his heart stopped.\n\nThe Sunday Times said it learnt that prior to his suspension, Beale was under a Netcare peer review after previous complaints were made against him; fined R80 000 by the HPCSA in 2018 for, among other things, gross negligence; and was suspended by Mediclinic in November 2016.\n\nBeale told the Sunday Times that his suspension was a kneejerk reaction and that while the incident was tragic, it was not his fault.\n\nHe said he had been given the all clear to leave following the operation, and believed the operation to be a success.\n\nHe also said the standards of South African hospital staff was questionable.\n\nHe wouldn't comment on the 2018 fine, the other review, and described his Mediclinic suspension as \"ridiculous\".\n\nNews24 this week reported that Dr Anchen Laubscher, Netcare's Group Medical Director, said Beale had been suspended pending an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the boy's death.\n\nEarlier this year another child passed away after a routine surgery by Beale.\n\nOf his suspension, Laubscher said: \"A peer review of all relevant information relating to the incident has been initiated, and a committee will determine sanctions as deemed appropriate, based on clinical and ethical guidelines.\n\n\"Once this process has concluded, it will be determined whether a report on the matter will be provided to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA),\" Laubscher told News24.\n\n- Compiled by Kaveel Singh", "description": "Johannesburg parents have described the shocking moments before their son died after being operated on by top SA paediatric surgeon Dr Peter Beale, who is currently under investigation for the boy's death, a report has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/03abaafcf16e4a78a6bb1fd3d98d9272.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
