This applies to those moving up from build 18362.10014, which had features off by default, and 18362.10015, which had features on by default.\n\nEven those on the Windows 10 May 2019 Update who are just joining the Slow ring to try out 19H2 updates will receive the same 18362.10019 build with all 19H2 features turned on.\n\nAnd now that everyone on the Slow Ring is on the same page, Microsoft has detailed what new features are included in 19H2 with features turned on.\n\nMicrosoft is allowing third-party digital assistants like Alexa to voice activate above the Lock screen in 19H2.\n\nAnd users can now create an event from the Calendar flyout on the Taskbar by clicking on the date and time in the bottom right corner of the Taskbar. This will open the Calendar flyout, allowing users to select a date and type in the text box.\n\nThere are a bunch of notifications improvements. Notification settings now sorts notifications senders by the most recently shown notification rather than sender name. Users can now turn off sound for new notifications and turn off app or website notifications from within the notification.\n\nMicrosoft has added a 'Manage notifications' button at the top of Action Center as a shortcut to the 'Notifications & actions' Settings page.\n\nSearch in File Explorer has been updated to show web-powered suggestions in addition to files locally indexed on the PC.\n\nThe update includes fixes for containers, inking latency issues specific to different OEMs, and new optimizations for different chips, as well as battery-saving improvements.\n\nThere's also a key-rotation feature that allows admins to roll recovery passwords on managed devices.\n\n\"This feature will help prevent accidental recovery password disclosure as part of manual BitLocker drive unlock by users,\" Microsoft explains.\n\nMore on Microsoft and Windows 10 updates", "description": "All Slow Ring insiders will now get the same build of Windows 10 update due this fall with features on by default.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/d64e759c-351b-48a7-a231-c0e69dd94850/thumbnail/770x578/cf205ed5800f73f628affc48351b0530/manbeardedcomuteristock-846845510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
