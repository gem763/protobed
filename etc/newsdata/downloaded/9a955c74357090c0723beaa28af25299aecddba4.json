It also accused investigators of denying Trump due process, including the right to see evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and threatened to end White House cooperation with Congress on important oversight matters.\n\nThe letter set the stage for a historic clash between the executive and legislative branches of the US government. Pelosi, who announced the impeachment inquiry last month after it emerged that Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden, delivered a scathing response.\n\n\u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the president is above the law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nThe speaker added: \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle 1 of the United States constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to initiate impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of the president. A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.\n\nThe process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment. A simple majority of members need to vote in favour of impeachment for it to pass to the next stage. Democrats currently control the house, with 235 representatives.\n\nThe chief justice of the US supreme court then presides over the proceedings in the Senate, where the president is tried, with senators acting as the jury. For the president to be found guilty two-thirds of senators must vote to convict. Republicans currently control the Senate, with 53 of the 100 senators.\n\nTwo presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before there was a formal vote to impeach him.\n\nMartin Belam\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump aides have begun honing their approach after two weeks of what some allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the inquiry. The letter appeared to put the emphasis on political rebuttal rather than structured legal argument \u2013 signalling a new strategy to counter the impeachment threat by openly defying Congress\u2019s right to investigate the president for high crimes and misdemeanours.\n\nThe House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, said: \u201cPresident Trump is right to call out this rushed process because Democrats refuse to protect the transparency and basic fairness that have been integral to previous impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nBut the letter was widely scorned by political analysts and legal experts. George Conway, a lawyer married to Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, tweeted: \u201cI cannot fathom how any self-respecting member of the bar could affix his name to this letter. It\u2019s pure hackery, and it disgraces the profession.\u201d", "description": "* House speaker says Democrats will push ahead with inquiry  * Trump warned: \u2018Mr President, you are not above the law\u2019Nancy Pelosi said: \u2018The White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the president is above the law.\u2019 Photograph: J Scott", "authors": ["David Smith In Washington"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bnE7K9dF65sXthoMmhcCgw--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/8a59bba4b3be25add8685a751b170cfe", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
