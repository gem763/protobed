My customers included lobstermen, and a hot topic of conversation was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s attempts to protect the shrinking North Atlantic right whale population. NOAA has ordered Maine to recommend a plan this month to reduce the number of whale deaths in its coastal waters. There\u2019s only one problem: No whale deaths due to entanglements or ship strikes have been recorded in Maine waters since 1998.\n\nAccording to NOAA, entanglement in endlines\u2014the fishing ropes connecting traps on the ocean floor to buoys floating on the surface\u2014is the \u201cleading cause of known right whale mortality.\u201d Facing pressure from environmental groups, the agency wants Maine to reduce the number of endlines deployed in its lobster fishery by 50%. The lobstermen I spoke with worry that meeting this target will gut the lobster industry. I was so concerned about what I heard that I wrote to President Trump, calling his attention to this issue.\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales numbered about 250 in the mid-1990s, but by 2015 had rebounded to an estimated 458. The population has now fallen nearly to 400 due to fewer calves being born and a spike in deaths. The loss of right whales is a problem, but penalizing Maine lobstermen won\u2019t save them.\n\nThe Maine lobster fishery and its supply chain contribute more than $1.7 billion to Maine\u2019s economy annually. In 2018 Maine lobstermen hauled in a record 54,000 tons of the red crustacean. Lobster has practically become synonymous with the tourist destination known as \u201cVacationland.\u201d Maine attracts about 37 million visitors each summer and lobster is frequently on their menus as well as on the souvenirs they take home.\n\nTariffs and bait shortages have hurt the industry, but the lobstermen I spoke to this summer told me that NOAA\u2019s proposed regulations could force many of them out of business. There is no evidence that making Maine\u2019s loberstermen pull their lines out of the water would save even one whale. Twenty years ago the local industry changed the type of ropes used for traps and added special links that whales could easily break. The whale population almost doubled after these and additional innovations were adopted in 2009 and 2014.\n\nThe new regulations would affect only lobstering by Mainers in the Gulf of Maine. But North Atlantic right whales no longer swim in the Gulf of Maine because the shrimplike plankton they eat have shifted to the cooler waters near the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Northern Canada, where heavy shipping traffic puts them at greater risk.\n\nLobstermen cooperated when the data supported changes, but recent data doesn\u2019t support further regulation of Maine\u2019s lobster industry. Instead it suggests the need for additional negotiation with Canada for more-effective protections.\n\nA June study published in the journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms reviewed the circumstances surrounding 70 known right whale deaths between 2003 and 2018. Entanglement was identified as the cause of death in 22 cases, of which 14 involved Canadian snow crab fishing gear. One death involved U.S. gear, and the remainder were unidentified.\n\nEight right whales have died so far this year, all in Canadian waters; four died from ship strikes, two died from entanglement. Reducing the number of Maine\u2019s endlines won\u2019t stop whale deaths from ship strikes in Canadian waters. Studies also indicate ocean noise from ships could be a significant source of whale stress, possibly contributing to the lack of calves being born.\n\nMaine\u2019s 4,500 commercial lobster fishermen run small businesses. In many cases their families have gone to sea for decades. They care deeply about protecting the environment, including whales, and manage one of the Earth\u2019s most sustainable fisheries.\n\nMeeting NOAA\u2019s proposed endline target will cost these small businesses significant revenue and force many fishermen to quit the industry. Furthermore, the regulations will needlessly increase the danger of what is already one of the most hazardous occupations in America. Halving the number of endlines means doubling the number of traps per line. This will add weight to Maine\u2019s small lobster boats, making them unstable and increasing the risk of fishermen getting caught in trap lines, falling overboard and drowning.\n\nInstead of implementing ineffective regulations in an area where they are unlikely to make a difference, NOAA should focus on where the whales are dying, which isn\u2019t the Gulf of Maine. The Commerce Department should address whale protection in future trade and environmental agreements with Canada. A good first step would be for the Trump administration to place a moratorium on these regulations, while a lawsuit being brought against NOAA by conservation groups under the Endangered Species Act moves forward.\n\nMaine\u2019s entire lobster industry is in turmoil over this. Thousands of small businesses at the heart of the state\u2019s tourist economy can\u2019t plan what their next year will look like. Let\u2019s use common sense and science to truly protect both the right whales and one of Maine\u2019s most valuable industries.\n\nMr. LePage, a Republican, was governor of Maine from 2011 to 2019.", "description": "The giant mammals have moved on to Canada, but the feds are targeting a local industry anyway.", "authors": ["Paul Lepage"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104991/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
