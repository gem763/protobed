For more information, see our ethics policy .\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S10 was $300 off during Amazon Prime Day earlier this week. If you missed out on that deal, you can get $200 off, which is still a good price, on the S10E, S10, and S10 Plus phones at Best Buy, Amazon, and B&H Photo.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an unlocked phone, you can save that $200 on any storage configuration. We\u2019ve listed the most affordable options below:\n\nIf you\u2019re changing carriers, you can get an even better deal at Best Buy: a staggering $500 off any S10 model (S10E, S10, S10 Plus) if you activate carrier service in-store through Sprint, Verizon, or AT&T. This discount brings the S10E down to $349.99, for example.\n\nIf you want a big Bluetooth speaker to bring to the beach, or just to have around the house, Daily Steals is offering Verge readers an exclusive discount on the Ultimate Ears MegaBoom speaker. Use the offer code VERGEMEGAB to get a MegaBoom for $69.99 instead of its usual $89.99 price.\n\nThis speaker offers 360-degree sound and IPX7 waterproofing (meaning it can handle a splash, but not submergence in water); the company claims up to 20 hours of battery life per charge. It\u2019s not Ultimate Ears\u2019 latest model (the MegaBoom was originally released in 2015), but it\u2019s nevertheless a good deal on a powerful speaker. It will arrive new (in a brown box, which Daily Steals says is directly from Logitech\u2019s overstock department) with a one-year warranty.\n\nOne of the stranger, but nevertheless great, Prime Day deals that\u2019s still going strong comes from Google Express. It\u2019s bundling together a Nintendo Switch console and Xbox One S (All-Digital) console for $399 (before tax). Enter the offer code GOTURE at checkout to see this price. That\u2019s around $100 off of what you\u2019d usually pay for the two consoles together. And if you want both of these consoles for yourself, one could make for a good gift to someone else.\n\nAnother Prime Day deal that is somehow still holding strong is LG\u2019s 65-inch C8 4K HDR OLED TV. It\u2019s $1,599 at eBay (usually $2,096). eBay ended up having one of the better prices on LG\u2019s C-series OLED TV during Prime Day 2019, and you can still get the sale price today.", "description": "Samsung\u2019s latest series of flagship phones are still discounted following Prime Day, and time may be running out to get in on the deal. Also, we\u2019ve pulled together a few other deals, including an exclusive offer on the UE MegaBoom Bluetooth speaker.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zCn67cSh80AvlL2Vph55jVpDFV4=/0x156:2040x1224/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14843658/akrales_190228_3255_0100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-20"}
