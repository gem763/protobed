He was then taken by police van to prison to collect his belongings.\n\nHe had been accused of running a vast trafficking network, with branches in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Libya, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Europe.\n\nItaly, Sudan and Britain at the time hailed his capture as the stellar result of a joint operation which had dealt a significant blow to the people smuggling business.\n\nDespite differences in appearance between the two men, and DNA evidence supporting Berhe's case, Italian prosecutors stuck to their guns throughout and had called for a 14-year jail sentence.\n\nOn Friday, they said they would wait for the court's reasoning to be published before deciding whether to appeal.\n\n'Made a mistake'\n\nMered ended up on an international wanted list after being identified as the man who organised the packing of migrants onto a boat that sank off Italy in October 2013, killing at least 360 people in one of the worst such disasters in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe \"cynical and unscrupulous\" Mered had been \"continuously and constantly reaping vast profits while showing a contempt for human life,\" according to a joint statement by Sudan, Italy and Britain announcing his arrest in May 2016.\n\nBut the images broadcast by Italian police of a thin young man with frizzy hair, looking frail as he walked off the plane in handcuffs, sparked confusion and disbelief within the Eritrean diaspora around the world.\n\nThose who had had dealings with Mered said it was not him. Berhe's family recognised him instantly.\n\nAccording to American, Italian and Swedish investigative journalists, Mered spent part of 2016 in prison in Dubai for using a false passport and now lives in Uganda.\n\nDNA evidence also suggested the wrong man was behind bars: tests on Behre's mother showed the defendant was her son.\n\nFurther tests, on Mered's three-year-old son, who lives in Sweden, showed the defendant was not his father.\n\nA New Yorker investigative reporter was told by \"the General\" himself in 2017 that the Italians had the wrong man.\n\n\"They should just have said 'we made a mistake',\" lawyer Michele Calantropo told AFP on Thursday head of the verdict.\n\nCalantropo insisted that the man behind bars has only one thing in common with the trafficker: his first name, Medhanie.\n\n\"This is one of the biggest injustices on the face of the earth,\" he said.\n\nMedhanie was the name flagged by Britain's National Crime Agency in 2016 when it heard someone going by that name calling the tapped phone of a suspected smuggler in Libya.\n\nThe man who made the calls was tracked down and arrested in Khartoum.\n\nBut while prosecutors said the calls were made to organise migrant trips, Calantropo said his client was just looking out for loved ones heading to Europe.", "description": "An Italian court ruled Friday that an Eritrean accused of being a human trafficking kingpin known as \"the General\" was telling the truth when he claimed it was a case of mistaken identity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8255/657e6bd8078641a389a08e281e15b95d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-14"}
