Each episode, a different young adult is given basic AV equipment and a crash course in filming so that they can document their life from their own perspective, pushing back against the limiting views of mainstream media. After an eye-opening first season (looking at the lives of homeless youth), Red Button is back (streaming now on CBC Gem) with 6 new episodes featuring candid, one-of-a-kind stories.\n\nOne such story is that of Taryn, a 17-year-old with Treacher Collins Syndrome, a genetic condition affecting facial structure. Taryn lives an ambitious life as a competitive dancer, rock climbing instructor and honour roll student. She acts in defiance of any setbacks, using her story to motivate herself and others. Here's what she told us about telling her story, her way:\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS), what are some of the challenges and misconceptions about it?\n\nTaryn: Having TCS has been a blessing and a curse. I have found so many more opportunities, like filming a documentary, and have met lots more friends through the facial difference community. However, I have faced many challenges. Wearing a hearing aid, I have to be so much more careful when I'm outside or doing other physical activities so I don't knock it off and damage it.\n\nBeing faced with having a facial difference has changed people's opinions on me in the past and will continue to change their opinion on me in the future.\n\nMisconceptions about TCS are that it impacts my ability to learn and take on new concepts. My facial difference does not affect my ability to learn, in fact, I have achieved much more than anybody thought I could. I finished high school with a high academic average and had the top marks in many of my classes. Walking across the stage and receiving my diploma made me feel so accomplished this year.\n\nDo you remember being aware of being underrepresented in media growing up, or was it more subconscious?\n\nI was definitely aware of it growing up. When you live in a community where no one has the same facial difference as you, you notice that you look completely different from everyone else. I knew that my facial difference was not very common, and what the odds were, and if you didn't know someone with a facial difference, you most likely didn't know what a facial difference was, because of how underrepresented it was in the media.\n\nWere there individuals/characters in media and pop culture that you were inspired by?\n\nThe book and the movie Wonder and the actor who played August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), were great inspiration over the last few years for me. I really enjoyed how the author presented Auggie as someone who had a facial difference and how he overcame so many challenges in his life.\n\nDid you have a plan before shooting your episode or did you film first and figure it out later?\n\nGoing into shooting the documentary, we had a rough outline of what I was going to film. Within an 8 week period, I had many important events lined out. I essentially filmed almost everything in my life and many of those small pieces made it into the final product to tie it all together. So yes, in theory, we had a plan for some of the major events to film, but, being given the freedom to film what I wanted lead to some powerful moments in the documentary.\n\nIs there anything you intentionally chose not to film or to edit out?\n\nI tried really hard not to filter things out when I was filming. I wanted the final piece to be as authentic as possible, and in order to do that I needed to make things as realistic as possible in my life. After watching the final product, I felt that the documentary captured aspects of my life that few people know about and I was really happy about it.\n\nAn estimated 1 in 50,000 people have TCS, what do you hope your episode can do for them?\n\nHaving a documentary on TCS is a way to promote not only TCS for the general public, but to show support for the TCS and facial difference community. Seeing other people who have TCS is almost never happens, unless the interaction is planned, and seeing someone else who has the same facial difference as you is one of the most exciting things in the world to someone with a facial difference. I want this episode to spread the awareness of TCS and other facial differences because facial differences are uncommon in daily life.\n\nThe other episodes in this season profile Tosconni, a transgender man dealing with anxiety, ADHD and depression, Abbigail, a 15-year-old carer for her twin brother who has Tourette syndrome and severe mood disorder, Holly, living with a mysterious psychosis, Damion, a cancer survivor struggling with the emotional and physical fallout of his radiation treatment, and Jadine, an 18-year-old with Cerebral Palsy, attending an independent living camp.\n\nAll 6 episodes are streaming now on CBC Gem.", "description": "Young adults with unique differences flip the script in Season 2 of CBC\u2019s Red Button.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290445.1568926455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/taryn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
