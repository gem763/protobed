I realised she had no idea he was ours\n\nEvery few weeks, my wife Camre watches our wedding video. It\u2019s a collection of photos from September 2015, put to music. She sees us walk down the aisle, listen to the speeches and hug our son, Gavin. It was the happiest day of my life. But she doesn\u2019t remember a thing about it.\n\nIn 2012 Camre was struggling with her first pregnancy. In her third trimester she started having difficulty breathing, and we knew it was time to get to hospital. Once there, she told me to go home and rest. My stomach fell when I got home and saw my mother was calling me. Camre had given birth, she said, and something had gone wrong.\n\nAfter a mad dash to the hospital I learned that Camre had had pre-eclampsia, which then turned into eclampsia. A massive seizure meant her brain had been deprived of oxygen for between five and eight minutes. An emergency caesarean had saved both her and Gavin, but Camre had suffered a devastating brain injury. It was complete chance that it hit her memory lobes, where the brain stores and makes memories. She could have lost her speech, or the function in her left arm, say. I didn\u2019t understand this at the time: I was torn between joy over our son and devastation that Camre was lying in a medicated coma.\n\nAs soon as she opened her eyes I thought: \u201cCamre\u2019s not there.\u201d She looked at me blankly, as if I were a stranger. I wheeled her to the intensive care unit to see Gavin, placing her hand in the incubator. She patted him distractedly and I realised she had no idea he was her son. It was heartbreaking. I knew then that I would have to be both mother and father to Gavin, and take care of the woman I loved. I wasn\u2019t scared, just determined.\n\nOver the next few days I learned how bad things were. Camre couldn\u2019t remember anything for more than a few seconds. Every time I left the room, I returned a stranger again. Not only had every memory gone \u2013 her childhood, my marriage proposal, her joy at the pregnancy \u2013 she couldn\u2019t make new memories.\n\nPhysically she made a great recovery, but I wasn\u2019t able to care for Gavin and Camre at home alone. Luckily, her parents were amazing. Together, we showed Camre again and again how to change a nappy, make up a bottle, brush her teeth. I juggled work and looking after Gavin. I was sleeping only two hours a night.\n\nOne day she looked at me and said, 'I don\u2019t know who you are, but I know I love you.' It was a turning point\n\nI did struggle \u2013 not with anger, but with frustration. It\u2019s hard to tell someone your name a hundred times an hour; to see Camre hold her son and ask, \u201cWhose baby is this?\u201d Sometimes I\u2019d think her brain was waking up and have a flash of hope, only to see it sink back again.\n\nBut one exhausting day, six weeks after Gavin\u2019s birth, Camre looked at me on the sofa. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know I love you.\u201d It was a turning point.\n\nWith occupational therapy and endless repetition she relearned how to do many things, which gave her some independence. She no longer needed daily reminders that I was her fiance and Gavin is her son. Her short-term memory now extends to three, sometimes four days; we stay hopeful that that will continue to get better, but the doctors don\u2019t really have answers when it comes to her long-term memory.\n\nI decided to propose to Camre, again, in 2013. Thankfully she said yes, and the wedding was wonderful. So many people rush through things only to enjoy them later, with hindsight. Everything I do with Camre, whether it\u2019s getting married or walking the dogs, is about really living in the moment.\n\nExperience: I was dragged along by a train at 75mph Read more\n\nWe try to have a sense of humour about it. I gave her the same Valentine\u2019s card three years in a row. Each time I\u2019d bust out this 3ft card with a bear on it and she thought it was hilarious. The fourth year, she said: \u201cYou gave me this last year!\u201d I\u2019d never been so pleased to be found out.\n\nNot that things are always easy. I know more about her life than she does. It\u2019s sometimes hard to wrap my head around that. She understands now that her injury means every memory of Gavin\u2019s childhood is being constantly wiped away. She looks so sad about it sometimes that it hurts my heart. It\u2019s why she keeps a daily journal; we both use writing as therapy.\n\nCamre says that what\u2019s happened has taught her how meaningful memories are. Now I remember for both of us.\n\n\u2022 As told to Kate Graham. But I Know I Love You, a book by Steve and Camre Curto about their experience, is out now.\n\nDo you have an experience to share?
