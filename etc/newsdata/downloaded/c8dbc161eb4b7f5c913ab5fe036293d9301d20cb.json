All of our victims have been recovered and they will be undergoing postmortems.\n\n\u201cThe recovery \u00adprocess was forensic and for those \u00adwho are thinking why does it take so much time to recover bodies in this manner and to try to \u00adidentify people, it is precisely this reason.\n\n\u201cIt is the dignity \u2013 it takes time to put into place but it must run through \u00adeverything we do and the recovery of those victims, in which order we are going to recover them, how we recover them.\n\n\u201cWe have to gain so much information to make sure we don\u2019t miss anything.
