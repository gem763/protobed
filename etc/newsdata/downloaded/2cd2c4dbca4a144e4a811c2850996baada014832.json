Between 2012, when President Obama ran, and 2016, when I ran, 12 million \u2013 12 million voters \u2013 were purged from the rolls,\" Clinton explained. \"They were purged in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Ohio, in Florida, in other places, often using a system devised and paid for by Robert Mercer. And when you have a Republican-controlled state government, as we did in those states back in 2016, it's practically impossible \u2013 in fact I'll say it is impossible \u2013 to fight back, let alone stop that very deliberate form of suppression.\"\n\nHillary Clinton: \"Voter purging is another form of voter suppression.

When he ran against her, he was sitting Secretary of State. Part of his job was to make sure voter rolls were up-to-date under the Motor Voter Act which President Bill Clinton signed into law back in the 1990s.\n\nHere's what the Motor Voter Act states (emphasis mine):\n\nSection 8 of the Act also creates requirements for how States maintain voter registration lists for federal elections. The Act deems as timely those valid voter registration applications by eligible applicants submitted to designated state and local officials, or postmarked if submitted by mail, at least 30 days before a federal election. The Act also requires notification of all applicants of whether their voter registration applications were accepted or rejected. The Act requires States to keep voter registration lists accurate and current, such as identifying persons who have become ineligible due to having died or moved outside the jurisdiction.\n\nHillary is upset that states are actually doing what they're supposed and following a law that her own husband signed back in the 1990s.\n\nHillary is upset because she feels that she should be president, much like Abrams thinks she should be governor, because people who are ineligible to vote \u2013 because they died, moved or became a criminal \u2013 were purged from the voter rolls.\n\nAnd Democrats wonder why Republicans are hell bent on keeping things current...because keeping these ineligible voters on the roster makes voter fraud more likely.", "description": "How quickly she forgets..09/18/2019 1:09:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/a9f9bd24-5d47-4ee1-93c5-46bb3e2ffc50.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
