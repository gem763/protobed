The blue-chip index shed 0.4% with exporter stocks such as Diageo and Unilever dragging the most, as sterling firmed after Ireland sounded optimism on the chances of Britain leaving the European Union in an orderly fashion. The mid-cap FTSE 250 added 0.3% by 0702 GMT. The index lagged the broader European benchmark , which rose after U.S. President Donald Trump stirred hopes of a trade agreement with China, calling the first day of talks \"very good\". The main index was also hurt by a near 4% drop in ad firm WPP after French rival Publicis cut its sales view for the second time, and a 3.4% fall in luxury brand Burberry after German rival Hugo Boss cut its annual forecast.\n\nFTSE falters as Brexit hopes lift pound, offsetting good trade signals", "description": "FTSE falters as Brexit hopes lift pound, offsetting good trade signals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB280W7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
