If you\u2019re in either exclusion zone, you should leave immediately.\n\nThe FCO said: \"There are many active volcanoes in Indonesia, any of which can erupt with little or no warning.

Check media reports before travelling to areas that are prone to volcanic activity.\"\n\nTravellers are warned the local alert level may change at short notice.
