The capital Wellington had been considered but was ruled out due to all available studio space being taken up by Hollywood director James Cameron, who is filming his four Avatar sequels there.\n\nThe deal is seen as a win for the New Zealand film industry and a coup for the government, which had been involved in months of negotiations with Amazon while it weighed up location options.\n\nAmazon's new Lord of the Rings 'cannot use much of Tolkien's plot' Read more\n\nPhil Twyford, New Zealand\u2019s economic development minister, described the \u201cambitious production\u201d as fantastic news for the country, and said it would create jobs and significant overseas investment.\n\nIt was New Zealand\u2019s \u201cmajestic\u201d scenery that could match the \u201cprimordial beauty\u201d of Middle Earth that helped clinch the deal, showrunners and executive producers JD Payne and Patrick McKay told news website Stuff.\n\nThat will be of little comfort to Scotland, which had been in the frame as a front-runner, with reports that uncertainty over Brexit saw it fall out of favour with Amazon.\n\nWhile precise plot details of the new series have been kept a closely guarded secret Amazon has revealed that the series will be set during the 3,441-year period before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring, with rumours the script will focus on a young Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen in the film trilogy.\n\nA JRR Tolkien expert working on the adaptation claimed in August that Amazon had been refused permission by the estate to use the bulk of the book\u2019s plot.\n\nFilming of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films was marred by controversy in New Zealand over the so-called \u201cHobbit Law\u201d, which barred film contractors from collectively bargaining, and later overcrowding at tourist hotspots connected to the films.\n\nThe Hobbit Law provoked street protests back in 2010 when the then National-led government in effect made it illegal for film industry workers to collectively bargain. The urgent law was prompted by threats from Jackson and Warner Bros. to take the shooting of the films to offshore locations.\n\nThis new billion-dollar deal may not be without its own cost to New Zealand ratepayers, with government film subsidies offering a rebate of up to 25%. That is sure to raise the ire of the New Zealand Taxpayers\u2019 Union, which has previously warned against what it saw as \u201cinternational bidding wars using taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d.\n\nIn 2018 the NZ Herald reported the subsidy scheme had paid out NZ$161m to Jackson for the director\u2019s Hobbit trilogy.", "description": "Auckland beats Scotland to NZ$1.3bn contract for what is expected to be the most expensive TV series ever made", "authors": ["Angela Cuming In Dunedin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bb87d90382b632400186feee853158ae7fc5f8a/0_0_512_307/master/512.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd4719d5fb7db6bd4d1ca87d19c52ea9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
