Allen Brack said the player, Chung Ng Wai, aka \u201cBlitzchung,\u201d must pay the \u201cconsequence\u201d for \u201cderailing\u201d the broadcast. But Brack said the company would also reduce Chung\u2019s suspension from the pro Hearthstone league from a year to six months. The company will also return the $10,000 in prize money Chung had previously been stripped of. The two commentators interviewing him were banished along with him, but Brack said their suspension has been reduced to six months. The transcript of Brack\u2019s statement was published soon after the email went out.\n\nIn a post-match interview, Chung had worn goggles and a gas mask, common symbols of the protest, and said to the camera \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.\u201d Hong Kong residents have protested Chinese incursions into the Hong Kong rule of law daily for months now, and the demonstrations are ongoing.\n\nBrack said Chung could not go unpunished for \u201ctaking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast.\u201d\n\nBacklash to Blizzard\u2019s announcement of the ban Tuesday was swift and furious. Gamers cancelled their Blizzard subscriptions, a popular commentator said he would not appear at the company\u2019s annual convention, U.S. college players protested on an official company tournament broadcast, and trolls tried to turn a popular character in another Blizzard title into a symbol of Hong Kong\u2019s resistance in an attempt to bait the Chinese government into banning the game.\n\nChinese tech giant TenCent owns 5 percent of Activision Blizzard, and the company made 12 percent of its Q2 2019 revenue in the Asia Pacific market, according to its earnings report. Brack denied any pressure from the Chinese government in his Friday statement: \u201cThe specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.\u201d\n\nOne Blizzard employee who spoke to the Beast didn\u2019t believe him: \u201cI think that it's a flat out lie that our relationships in China had nothing to do with the decision.\u201d\n\nThe employee added, \u201cI'm glad they gave the player his prize winnings back and reduced the bans but I'm still not happy that any of this happened in the first place.\u201d\n\nA small group of Blizzard employees walked out of work Tuesday in protest of the ban. They gathered at a statue of an orc warrior in the center of the company\u2019s campus in Irvine, California. The Daily Beast first reported news of the walkout.\n\nOne employee previously told the Beast of the ban, \u201cBlizzard makes a lot of money in China, but now the company is in this awkward position where we can\u2019t abide by our values.\u201d\n\nThe company had been silent since banning Chung on Tuesday, refusing media requests and not communicating with its employees, according to two Blizzard employees who spoke to the Daily Beast throughout the week.\n\nWhen Brack finally did break the silence, he ended on a stern note, vowing to keep official company broadcasts on topic and not become \u201ca platform for divisive social or political views.\u201d He said he hopes this approach will \u201cmake sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.\u201d", "description": "A Blizzard employee told the Beast: \u201cI think that it's a flat out lie that our relationships in China had nothing to do with the decision.\u201d", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_65/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570845792/RTX72GWU_1_afezv3", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
