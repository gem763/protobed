It's an odd thing to do,' Mr Gregg said.\n\n'If you were in real desperate need to go to the toilet we were open, so she could have come and used the toilet. So that would again point to (it being targeted).'\n\nSeparate videos show the jogger defecating in public during her early morning run last Thursday, and again just after 6am on Monday morning.\n\nFurious with the young woman's behaviour, Ms Jacenko told Daily Mail Australia she has found faeces on the street for three weeks.\n\n'It's disgusting, it's a lovely street lined with heritage terraces, kids playing and riding their bikes. Human faeces shouldn't be on any street,' she said.\n\nOn the case: Publicity mogul Jacenko (above) claimed the 'poo jogger' who has left a mess near her work was enjoying themselves\n\nVideos show the jogger desperately running and crouching behind a car to relieve herself (pictured)\n\n'Something needs to be done.'\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Ms Jacenko told Kyle and Jackie-O that the woman deserves no sympathy.\n\n'This isn't a person with irritable bowel syndrome, this is a person who's getting off on it!' Roxy said on Tuesday, after some of her Instagram followers suggested the woman may have a health problem.\n\nShe added: 'When I Googled it [public defecation], I was shocked how around the world this is a thing.'\n\nRoxy then encouraged the unidentified woman and other poo joggers to find a better hobby, saying: 'Take up swimming, or something? Why do you need to s**t in the street?'\n\nThe 39-year-old celebrity publicist is determined to find the culprit and posted the videos to Instagram to get public assistance on Monday evening.\n\nWhile the third video does not show the woman defecating, it is a clear shot of her running down the street, wearing navy running tights and a lavender top\n\nIn another video taken on Monday morning, the jogger is seen once again crouching behind a car and relieving herself\n\nJacenko deleted footage of the incident from her Instagram account - which has nearly 250,000 followers - on Tuesday morning.\n\nShe told Daily Mail Australia she 'actually didn't want to look at it any longer, it's simply revolting.\n\n'I don\u2019t believe that this is a medical condition, and if it is, there are many ways to ensure that this is managed using incontinence products which are readily available rather than a street by residences, places of work and even worse a junior school.\n\nShe claimed: 'This person is looking for a thrill which is why this is happening in full daylight, multiple times a week in the SAME spot. We aren't talking about a one off, this is a repeat offender.'\n\nDefecating in public is a type of offensive conduct in New South Wales and carries a maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment and/or a $660 fine.
