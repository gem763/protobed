But inside, it\u2019s cavernous with green carpet cordoned into lanes by mesh nets. Underneath the bright lights, the ones that can make you forget what time it is, Soto explained to hitting coach Kevin Long that he suspected his struggles in the postseason \u2014 7 for 34 overall (.206) \u2014 were caused by pulling his front hip. Long agreed; the young star was out in front of everything.\n\nHitting obsesses Soto. He considers it a kind of art. He hones his swing as craft, protects the batter\u2019s box as though it\u2019s his property and employs the \u201cSoto shuffle\u201d \u2014 pawing the dirt, licking his lips, grabbing his crotch \u2014 to intimidate opposing pitchers. The young Dominican\u2019s bat has defined him since his graceful swing and knack for barreling balls caught the attention of international scouts. It\u2019s why the Nationals gave him a $1.5 million signing bonus at 16. It\u2019s why he rocketed through their minor-league system, leapfrogged Class AAA altogether and debuted in the majors last year at 19. It\u2019s why he\u2019ll hit cleanup in the World Series before his 21st birthday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe slump robbed Soto of his swagger. He pressed, lost his \u00adpatience and swung at pitches out of the strike zone that he would otherwise let go. Long thought the problem might be linked to Soto\u2019s September slump (16 for his last 78, .206). It might, at its root, go back to his first six weeks of the season because, when the young hitter fell out of rhythm, he suffered those other, smaller breakdowns.\n\nOne thing stuck out to Long: Pitchers were attacking Soto with a ton of breaking balls. He struggled most against sliders: His .621 on-base-plus-slugging percentage is 300 points lower than his \u00adsecond-worst pitch. Soto showed an ability to adjust \u2014 he homered off a slider in Game 5 of the NLDS \u2014 but their movement wasn\u2019t the most dangerous part. Soto saw so many breaking pitches he started expecting them, and that recalibrated his timing from what Long saw as the ideal. The coach wants hitters to sit fastball, so they can catch a 100-mph pitch and react to everything else.\n\nLong set up seven baseballs in a horizontal line toward Soto at the plate. The seventh was farthest from him; the first was almost across the plate to the catcher\u2019s mitt. Long wanted to counteract Soto\u2019s distorted timing by heightening his awareness of where he made contact. That would recondition his body to read, react and get the bat barrel where it needed to be against different types of pitches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn each pitch, Long told Soto, call out the number \u2014 one to seven \u2014 where you contact the ball.\n\n\u201cThree!\u201d Soto called out on the first pitch, a fastball.\n\n\u201cNo, that was a one,\u201d Long remembered explaining.\n\nSoto was shocked. The ball got deeper than he realized because he prepared for a breaking ball. Long emphasized gearing up earlier than he thought necessary, and he asked Soto to try for contact at three or four. Long has always considered bat control one of Soto\u2019s strengths, and he watched as he made the \u201ceasy adjustment\u201d within pitches. Soto started smacking balls back up the chute, and Long remembered Soto\u2019s instant reaction.\n\n\u201cOh, my God. There it is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe whole thing took no longer than 20 minutes, but when Soto left the cage, he felt renewed confidence. Long grinned and told him to sleep well. They needed to sweep the Cardinals.\n\nAD\n\nThat night, in the first inning of Game 4, Soto stayed on a low-and-away sinker and instead of rolling over it, he flipped it down the left field line for a double. He kept the line moving on what became a seven-run first, and after he scored, raced over to Long in the dugout and told him the swing felt \u201creally, really good.\u201d He later smoked two more fastballs and, though they were caught, the solid contact encouraged him.\n\nThe biggest boost came in the seventh, when the Cardinals\u2019 big left-hander, Andrew Miller, threw him a slider down and in. It was a pitch Soto probably would\u2019ve managed weak contact against before. This time, though, he channeled everything he had learned hours ago in the cage. He reacted to the slider, backed up his contact point and barreled it. He drilled the ball into right field for a single. Long saw what anyone else paying attention did, a warning sign for all the pitchers to come. Juan Soto felt he was back.\n\nAD\n\nMore on the Nationals:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The 20-year-old phenom and hitting coach Kevin Long made one minor tweak, and the results showed on the team's biggest stage the next night.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tSEhBdf4SWHhsOCq_uIMYXAVPnI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HWZA2VHPWAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
