Anybody can do it if I can do it. Believe me \u2014 I am not the smartest in the room,\u201d the billionaire joked. \u201cI just worked really hard. And Socialism really scares me.\"\n\nHOUSTON, TX - MARCH 15: Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta leaves the court after the game against the Phoenix Suns at Toyota Center on March 15, 2019 in Houston, Texas. More\n\nFertitta opened his first restaurant in 1980, and over the last 30 years built a restaurant and hospitality empire with more than 600 locations in 36 states and 15 countries.\n\nSome of the brands include Bubba Gump Shrimp, Rainforest Cafe, Dos Caminos, and Mastro's Steakhouse, to name a few.\n\nThe restauranteur added that he had been friends with the last five presidents, whether they were Republican or Democrat.\n\nMark your calendar. More\n\nNone of the Oval Office\u2019s occupants ever \u201cbothered me because they all believed in capitalism and capitalists. And, that is why our country is so great, and everybody wants to come here, let's be honest.\"\n\n\n\nJulia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.
