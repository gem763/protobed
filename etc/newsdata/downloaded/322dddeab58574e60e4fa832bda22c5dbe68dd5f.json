Her daughter had been sidelined by a pair of boys who identify as girls and have been blowing away the competition in state-level girls\u2019 track meets. One thing she touched on was the efforts by Democrats to pass a piece of legislation known as the Equality Act.\n\nIf that bill becomes law, it will spread the trend of boys being allowed to compete in girls\u2019 competitive sports across the nation, basically eliminating women\u2019s sports as it currently exists. But you haven\u2019t heard anything about this topic during the debates and precious little on cable news or in the larger newspapers. This lack of coverage exists despite the fact that every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed the Equality Act and promised to sign it into law if elected. The Daily Caller has a deep dive into this media blackout that\u2019s definitely worth a look.\n\nDemocrats have made girls\u2019 sports a 2020 campaign issue, but establishment media outlets are keeping their viewers and readers in the dark. Every Democratic frontrunner has pledged their support of the Equality Act, which would make \u201cgender identity\u201d a protected characteristic under federal anti-discrimination law. Among other things, the bill would force public schools to expand female athletic teams to include biological males who identify as transgender girls. Every Democratic frontrunner for president has pledged their support for the bill, which passed the House in May with unanimous Democratic support. But when establishment media outlets have covered the Equality Act in relation to the 2020 election, the girls\u2019 sports issue has gone missing.\n\nThe study goes on to point out that only a single article on CNN\u2019s website (from May of this year) mentions the issue of transgender athletes in girls\u2019 sports. They recently hosted a candidate forum focused exclusively on LGBT issues and the subject was never mentioned once.\n\nBut CNN was hardly the only major media outlet that\u2019s been silent on this question. The New York Times provided coverage of the House passage of the bill but included zero mentions of the athlete question. The Washington Post briefly mentioned the athlete question back when the bill was voted on in the House, and to their credit, they also published an op-ed from three top-level female athletes on the subject, but since then they haven\u2019t mentioned it again.\n\nThe list goes on. This subject is receiving zero media attention outside of conservative outlets. The vast majority of the public likely knows little to nothing about it as they prepare to vote. And all of this is taking place while polls consistently show that a majority of voters across party lines believe that biological males have an unfair advantage against actual female athletes. Why isn\u2019t this issue receiving more attention? It might be because most MSM figures know how unpopular it would be so it\u2019s probably better to simply not bring it up.\n\nThere\u2019s another debate tonight with all of the potential nominees who have endorsed the Equality Act on the stage. Do you suppose any of them will be asked about this? I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath waiting.", "description": "The silence is deafening", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/race.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
