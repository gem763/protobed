Weiss quit new trilogy", "language": "en", "text": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 David Benioff and D.B. Weiss will no longer direct a new Star Wars trilogy.\n\nDeadline reported Monday that Benioff and Weiss, best known for the HBO series Game of Thrones, have walked away from their deal with Disney\u2019s Lucasfilm.\n\nBenioff and Weiss were to launch a new feature film trilogy in 2022. The Skywalker saga, which started with George Lucas\u2019 Star Wars in 1977, will come to a close with The Rise of Skywalker in December.\n\n\u201cWe love Star Wars,\u201d Benioff and Weiss said in a statement. \u201cWhen George Lucas built it, he built us too. Getting to talk about Star Wars with him and the current Star Wars team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything.\u201d\n\nBenioff and Weiss cited their busy schedules. The pair landed an exclusive, multi-year deal with Netflix in August to write, produce and direct new projects.\n\n\u201cThere are only so many hours in the day, and we felt we could not do justice to both Star Wars and our Netflix projects. So we are regretfully stepping away,\u201d the duo said.\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said she hopes to work with Benioff and Weiss in the future.\n\n\u201cDavid Benioff and Dan Weiss are incredible storytellers. We hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on Star Wars,\u201d she said.\n\nKennedy is overseeing a number of other Star Wars projects, including a new film from The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson and the Disney+ series The Mandalorian. Disney+ released a new trailer for The Mandalorian this week.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 David Benioff and D.B. Weiss will no longer direct a new Star Wars trilogy.
