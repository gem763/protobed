A spokesman for Malaysia\u2019s prime minister did not respond to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nMany Iranians said they knew of dozens of compatriots who had received notices from CIMB and RHB Bank (RHBC.KL).\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform (you) that we are unable to continue the banking relationship,\u201d CIMB said in identical notices reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe banks did not state a reason, but some individuals said bank officials attributed the move to tighter scrutiny after the sanctions.\n\nCIMB and RHB declined to comment. Malaysia\u2019s central bank directed queries to the Association of Banks in Malaysia, which declined to comment.\n\nSuch matters depended on individual banks\u2019 own risk appetite and assessment, the central bank said this month in an email response to one Iranian\u2019s complaint that was viewed by Reuters.\n\nBut a July notification on the central bank\u2019s website refers to a statement by the Financial Action Task Force urging \u201cenhanced due diligence\u201d on Iranians by members of the global money laundering watchdog.\n\nIran\u2019s embassy in Kuala Lumpur said it was working to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by goodwill and cooperation of the Malaysian officials, the negotiations will yield a positive result,\u201d it told Reuters in an email last week, adding that Iranian companies had also been affected.\n\nFor now, Iranians in the Malaysian capital have been left wondering how to pay school fees or hospital bills.\n\n\u201cWithout a bank account we need to use the ancient techniques, keeping money under the pillow or in teapots,\u201d said one of them, who sought anonymity. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "description": "Banks in Malaysia are closing the accounts of Iranian individuals and companies, nearly a dozen affected people told Reuters, in a sign that U.S. sanctions are having a far-reaching impact on citizens of the Islamic republic.", "authors": ["Liz Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
