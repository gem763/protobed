The showcase marks the first time 5G has been demonstrated in Myanmar, according to the companies.\n\nHeld at Myanmar Plaza Yangon, the companies will showcase a range of 5G use cases, including an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience and a drone-based monitoring system.\n\nThe VR demonstrations will use Ooredoo Myanmar's 5G network and allow viewers to watch 3D video footage at every single camera angle without any buffering, the companies said.\n\nDuring live speed tests, Ooredoo Myanmar's 5G network provided speeds of up to 1.75Gbps.\n\n\"The demonstration embodies our readiness to lead the digital transformation across the society, the industry, and day-to-day life in Myanmar. We are excited to provide our customers with new experiences in partnership with ZTE Corporation,\" said Rajeev Sethi, CEO of Ooredoo Myanmar.\n\nSee also: Ooredoo Myanmar and GSMA team up with Facebook for digital literacy\n\nIn June, the Chinese telco provider announced a similar partnership with Orange Espa\u00f1a to showcase various use cases for 5G networks in Valencia, Spain.\n\nZTE's telco equipment is currently banned from participating in 5G rollouts in Australia and Japan, with the countries citing that ZTE and compatriot Huawei are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from Beijing.\n\nHowever, European companies are continuing to work with Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei. All of the UK's main telcos are using equipment from Huawei in their 5G rollouts, despite the UK government not yet making a decision on whether Huawei equipment can be used in the UK's 5G network.\n\nIn the US, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ban US companies from buying, installing, or using foreign-made telecommunications equipment, citing cyber-espionage fears. The ban effectively targets Chinese equipment providers like ZTE and Huawei, although no names are mentioned in the executive order's text.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nZTE signs agreement with university to develop 5G in Colombia\n\nIt's making 'technical preparations' for the deployment of 5G in Colombia.\n\nZTE launches Brussels cybersecurity lab as a transparency play\n\nThe lab's main purpose will be to allow regulators and potential clients to perform black box and penetration testing, as well as review its source code and documents.\n\nOrange Espa\u00f1a uses ZTE to conduct 5G demos\n\nThe demonstrations were held at the European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC) in Valencia, Spain.\n\nHow holding off on 5G can save money and help the environment (TechRepublic)\n\nTechRepublic's Karen Roby interviews a telecommunications equipment expert about the potential benefits of sticking with 4G\u2014or even 3G\u2014in areas that aren't ready to move to 5G.", "description": "It is the first time 5G use cases have been demonstrated in the country, the companies said.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/6af3fce3-77ee-4c75-9e31-2deae77087b6/thumbnail/770x578/b2e5050b40be69934c447264f58e67e7/istock-1137736620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
