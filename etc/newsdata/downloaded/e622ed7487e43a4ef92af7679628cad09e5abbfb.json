She lives in London with her daughter.\n\nGrowing up in Russia, a staple part of my diet was kefir \u2014 an ancient cultured milk drink. It\u2019s popular throughout Russia, Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. I\u2019ve been drinking it since I was four months old.\n\nBut when I moved to Ireland in 1999 \u2014 to take up a new job at KPMG, having been working for the firm in corporate finance \u2014 and later London, I found it was hard to get hold of kefir. What I could find didn\u2019t match the quality I was used to back home.\n\nLondon-based Natasha Bowes (pictured) founded healthy foods brand Biotiful Dairy, after struggling to find kefir\n\nI badly missed both the taste and the health benefits. Kefir has more than 40 types of beneficial gut-friendly bacteria and yeasts, as well as vitamins and calcium. That was my light bulb moment.\n\nI decided to make a product myself that was natural, delicious and of a very high quality.\n\nI had some savings, so I left my job and began researching how to make the best kefir I could. I travelled to Russia and visited production sites to see how it was done and to find ingredients.\n\nThen I came back to the UK and found a production base, as well as a dairy consultant to help. I also enrolled in various courses, including food safety.\n\nAfter four months of extensive experimenting with different flavours and packaging, we finally launched in 2013 with our Organic Kefir range, straight into Selfridges, Harrods, Fortnum & Mason and Planet Organic.\n\nDelicious: Kefir gut-friendly drinks range, biotifuldairy.com\n\nI ran lots of product tastings in stores myself, as I wanted to speak to customers and get as much feedback as possible. I was thrilled to find that the response was overwhelmingly positive, and within 18 months, we started selling through Ocado, too.\n\nTwo years after launching, we introduced morello cherry and honey flavours, as families wanted something naturally sweeter to appeal to children.\n\nWe had no big marketing budget, so relied on word of mouth. Thankfully that worked and sales took off: our average year-on- year growth has been more than 250 per cent.\n\nWe now have a range of kefir drinks and high-protein snacks, and are stocked in all major UK supermarkets. This month we\u2019re launching a children\u2019s range, with no added sugar.\n\nWhen I began there was very little consumer awareness of kefir. Now everyone is talking about fermented products. I\u2019m so pleased to have been a part of that.", "description": "Natasha Bowes from Russia founded healthy food and drinks brand Biotiful Dairy, in 2013.
