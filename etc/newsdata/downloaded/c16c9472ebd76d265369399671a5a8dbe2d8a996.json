Its claws had been clipped and it was in good health.\n\nBefore its capture it had descended stairs in the building and entered an apartment belonging to a family whose 15-year-old daughter was at home - and fled upon seeing the panther walk into the room.\n\nHowever the animal was not aggressive, the girl's mother Sylvie told La Voix du Nord.\n\nImage copyright France fire service\n\nAfter its capture the panther was put in a cage and handed over to government wildlife officials, who in turn handed it on to the Animal Protection League to stay overnight.\n\nIt has since been transferred onwards to an as yet unannounced destination, La Voix du Nord reported.\n\nIts owner meanwhile is being sought by the French authorities. Police want to speak to the owner for endangering others and also to find out where they got the animal from, while wildlife officials want to know what conditions the panther was being held in.\n\nA police source told La Voix du Nord that only a zoo would be able to obtain a permit to keep such an animal. Officers had been ready to shoot the animal had it become aggressive during the incident, he said.\n\nYou might also be interested in", "description": "The powerful feline spent an hour walking along a second-floor ledge before it was tranquilised.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/E21E/production/_108868875_mediaitem108868874.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
