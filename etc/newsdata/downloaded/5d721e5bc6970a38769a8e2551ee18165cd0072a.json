Barr on potential corruption investigations connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival, and an unsubstantiated theory about stolen Democratic emails in 2016.\n\nMr. Zelensky reacted to Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the United States had \u201cdone a lot for Ukraine\u201d by saying that his country was ready to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States for its long-running war against Russian-backed separatists in the country\u2019s east.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d Mr. Trump responded, pressing Mr. Zelensky to use Mr. Barr\u2019s help in opening an investigation of a company involved in the beginnings of the F.B.I. inquiry of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. He also pressed Mr. Zelensky repeatedly to open an investigation of Mr. Biden and his family. Both held the potential to benefit the president politically.", "description": "Separately, two intelligence officials referred Mr. Trump\u2019s activity to the Justice Department for a possible investigation.
