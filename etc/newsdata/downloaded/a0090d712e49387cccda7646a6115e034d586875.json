(March 11) AP\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is banning U.S. flights to all Cuban cities except Havana in the latest move to roll back the Obama-era easing of relations, officials said Friday.\n\nSupporters of the ban said it would starve the Havana government of cash and limit its ability to repress Cubans and support Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. wants to overthrow.\n\nOpponents said prohibiting flights would simply make it harder for Cuban-Americans to visit their families outside the capital, without making a significant impact on the Cuban government.\n\nThe State Department said JetBlue flights to Santa Clara in central Cuba and the eastern cities of Holguin, Camaguey would be banned starting in December. American Airlines flights to Camaguey, Holguin and Santa Clara, the beach resort of Varadero and the eastern city of Santiago are also being banned.\n\nFlights to Havana, which account for the great majority of U.S. flights to Cuba, will remain legal.\n\n\u201cThis action will prevent the Castro regime from profiting from U.S. air travel and using the revenues to repress the Cuban people,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter. Raul Castro stepped down as president last year but remains head of the Communist Party, the country\u2019s highest authority.\n\nAnother stated reason for the move is to prevent tourism to Cuba, which is barred by U.S. law. But it is not clear how many people take the banned flights for tourism purposes. Many are used by Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in cities far from Havana by road.\n\n\u201cEager to punish Cuba\u2019s unbreakable defiance, imperialism is going after regular flights to various Cuban cities. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re affecting family relations, or the modest pocketbooks of most Cubans in both countries,\u201d Carlos F. de Coss\u00edo, head of Cuba\u2019s department of U.S. affairs, said on Twitter. \u201cOur response isn\u2019t changing.\u201d\n\nStill want to visit Cuba? How you still go despite new U.S. travel restrictions\n\nCuba travel ban goes into effect: 800,000 cruise passengers impacted\n\nThe Trump administration is banning U.S. flights to all Cuban cities except Havana starting in December 2019.

The other remaining legal option is a flight to Havana and then a road trip that could last as much as eight to more than 12 hours over rutted, unsafe roads, in the case of Cuba\u2019s eastern cities.\n\nJetBlue and American issued brief statements saying they would comply with the decision.\n\nThe announcement coincided with an event in Miami calling for regime change in Cuba and featuring U.S. officials, Organization of Americans States President Luis Almagro, and a variety of Cuban-Americans and Cuban dissidents.\n\n\u201cThis is a step forward,\u201d said Cuba-born barber Ernesto Regues, who said he left the island in 2012 and still has family in Havana. \u201cNow they need to stop the flights to Havana.\u201d\n\nCarrie Filipetti, deputy assistant secretary for Cuba and Venezuela in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Havana would serve as the gateway for Cuban-Americans wanting to see their relatives.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that Cuban-Americans do have a route to their families. You need to enter. Havana is currently carved out for this,\u201d she said.\n\nShe warned, however, that \u201cwe will continue to increase sanctions\u201d and said other countries should do the same.\n\n\u201cIt is a long path with many steps along the way,\u201d she said to a standing ovation.\n\nLourdes D\u00edaz, a retired Cuban-American who arrived in the U.S. one year after Castro\u2019s Revolution, said she disagrees with the current sanctions, feeling they help Cuba\u2019s communist government more than hurt it.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that suffers is the people,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nThe Trump administration has been regularly tightening the six-decade-old embargo on Cuba in recent months with the stated purpose of cutting off income to the Cuban government and forcing it to cut ties to Venezuela and grant more human rights to Cuban citizens. Washington has barred U.S cruise ships visiting Cuba, sanctioned oil tankers moving petroleum from Venezuela to Cuba and permitted lawsuits against foreign companies profiting from their use of properties confiscated from Americans or from Cubans who later obtained American citizenship.\n\nThe measures have contributed to the Cuban government\u2019s chronic shortages of hard currency and were blamed for several weeks of fuel shortages on the island, but so far there is no indication that the Trump policy is having its desired effect. Cuba\u2019s security services continue to detain and harass dissenters and human rights groups say freedom of expression, assembly and other rights remain highly curtailed.\n\nThe Cuban and Venezuelan government remain tightly aligned and both have declared their intent to become even closer allies in the face of the Trump measures.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/28/cuba-travel-ban-us-outlaws-flights-all-cities-except-havana/2483523001/", "description": "Starting in December, the State Department will bar JetBlue and American Airlines from flying to eastern cities.
