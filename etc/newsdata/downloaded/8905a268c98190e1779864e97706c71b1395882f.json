United goalkeeper Bill Hamid made two saves and earned a fourth consecutive shutout. (Steve Luciano/AP)\n\nHARRISON, N.J. \u2014 Amid the unsightliness of a 0-0 draw with the New York Red Bulls on Sunday, D.C. United took a step toward hosting an MLS playoff game by remaining ahead of both its arch-rivals and Toronto FC for fourth place in the Eastern Conference with one weekend left in the regular season.\n\n\u201cI am past pretty right now,\u201d United Coach Ben Olsen said. \u201cWe had a job to do, and that was to put ourselves in a position next week for a home [playoff] game, and we did that.\"\n\nUnited (13-10-10, 49 points) registered its fourth consecutive shutout and ended a five-game losing streak to the Red Bulls (14-13-6, 48). Toronto (12-10-11, 47) settled for a 2-2 draw at Chicago, putting United in position to finish fourth by defeating league-worst Cincinnati (6-22-5) next Sunday at Audi Field.\n\nHowever, captain Wayne Rooney will miss the final regular season home appearance of his MLS career before returning to England this winter. He received a yellow card in the 77th minute, pushing him past the season limit and resulting in a one-game suspension.\n\nIf United fails to host a playoff game, the striker will have played his final home match last week against Seattle.\n\n\u201cI am gutted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think [the referee\u2019s decision] was a little bit soft.\u201d\n\nUnited has not won at Red Bull Arena since the 2012 playoffs, but given the late-season circumstances, this result was almost as satisfying as a victory. Since 2015, the Red Bulls are 10-1-5 in the series.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to bring home a win \u2014 that would have solidified it more \u2014 but looking at the results, we have everything in our hands,\u201d defender Russell Canouse said.\n\nNeither team performed well: The first half was a clunker, and the Red Bulls were far more dangerous in the second. United\u2019s Bill Hamid made an extraordinary save after intermission to help extend his scoreless streak to 414 minutes and earn a 13th shutout.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the scrappiest match I\u2019ve seen all year long,\u201d Hamid said. \u201cThe foul count was high, physical all over the pitch, in the air. This was a dogfight. Maybe they will be happy with the point, but I know we are.\u201d\n\nUnited felt good about its chances, if not to win than to claim a draw and stay ahead of New York in the playoff race.\n\nOlsen did not make any lineup changes, fully invested in a unit that took hold a few weeks ago and provides the work rate and defensive commitment that he requires.\n\nRooney credited, in particular, Hamid and center backs Frederic Brillant and Steve Birnbaum for thwarting the Red Bulls.\n\n\u201cThe attacking players get a lot of credit for scoring goals and creating chances, but they got us that point,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThe two of them and Bill were outstanding.\u201d\n\nThe first half was choppy and uneventful, with neither side manufacturing opportunities or testing the high-end goalkeepers, Hamid and New York\u2019s Luis Robles. With United playing more conservatively than at home last week, Rooney\u2019s set pieces were United\u2019s greatest threats.\n\nBuoyed by the shutout string, United defended with confidence and was not fazed by New York\u2019s counterattacking forays.\n\nThe half ended without any excitement, 45 minutes all but wasted. The highlight was counting the upper-deck sections at Red Bull Arena covered by tarps. (It\u2019s at least 20.)\n\nA sequence early in the second half epitomized the dismal state of the match. New York\u2019s Josh Sims was presented with a golden opportunity just inside the penalty area. He shanked the shot so far off target, a teammate was able to retrieve it at the end line and cross the ball back into the mix.\n\nGlancing at the stats sheet after the match, Olsen said, \u201cCan you even count possession [percentages] in a game like that?\u201d\n\nThe momentum turned in the Red Bulls\u2019 favor early in the second half.\n\nBrillant made a goal-line clearance by nodding aside a close-range header. Two minutes later, Hamid made a breathtaking stop, springing to his right to get his fingers on Cristian Casseres Jr.'s bid from inside the penalty area.\n\nUnited was going nowhere in the attack. Meanwhile, the collective defensive effort alleviated pressure, not unlike recent harrowing victories at Montreal and Portland.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t break,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cOverall, a good point.\u201d\n\nNotes: Forward Ola Kamara, whom Olsen said Friday would return to active duty after a two-game absence, did not travel because of a lingering hamstring injury. \u2026\n\nFor the third consecutive year, New York won the Atlantic Cup, awarded to the winner of the season series. The Red Bulls won at Audi Field, 2-1, last month.\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C.
