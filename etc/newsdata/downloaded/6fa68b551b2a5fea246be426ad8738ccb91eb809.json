It has had a meteoric rise since it was founded 20 years ago, and earlier this month exceeded 10 trillion kroner in value as stock markets rallied after a volatile third quarter and the Norwegian currency slumped to a record low. The fund invests abroad to avoid stoking inflation at home.\n\nThe largest stock holdings at the end of the quarter were Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. Its largest bond holdings were in U.S. Treasuries, followed by Japanese government bonds.\n\nThe fund continued to pare its emerging market bond holdings after this year receiving approval from the government. The fund has argued it makes little sense to own government bonds across the world since they have become more correlated and that it's also exposed to a wide array of currency risk through its ballooning stock holdings.\n\nEmerging markets slid to 7.7% of the bond portfolio from 7.9% at the end of the second quarter.\n\nIn the quarter, the government withdrew 5 billion kroner, compared with a 6 billion-krone deposit in the second quarter. After making its first withdrawal in over a year in August, the Conservative-led government said it planned to tap the fund in the following months as well, covering for lower-than-expected oil and gas income due to weak prices.\n\nNorway self-imposed budget rules limits spending of oil cash to 3% of the fund's value each year. That used to be easily covered by the annual income from petroleum taxes, public stakes in offshore fields and dividends from state-controlled Equinor ASA.\n\nFollowing a historic slump in crude prices that started in 2014, the government was forced to withdraw money from the fund for the first time in 2016.\n\nThe fund's return in the quarter beat its benchmark by 0.01 percentage point.\n\n\n\n- With assistance from Stephen Treloar and Jonas Cho Walsgard.", "description": "Yngve Slyngstad has overseen huge change at the fund, including a partial retreat from the fossil fuel industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/b4a017c8fff94efbadceb69b4e823701_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
