I have no further comment.\u201d\n\nWhen the news broke, Lottie said: \u201cI appreciate the messages sent between myself and Lubna could come across as offensive but they were intended as a joke and no offence was meant by them.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nLubna also had her say on that fiery clash with Lottie in South Africa during the first task.\n\nGiving her verdict, she told us: \"I am someone who speaks when I need to speak and I did feel strongly I had to step in.\n\n\"I felt the sub team leader should have spoken up. If she had been a stronger leader and managed Lottie better I would not have to speak up.\n\n\"It's not like I\u2019m an attention seeker and was speaking up to be in the limelight. I'd had enough of not being given an opportunity to talk when I\u2019m already an introvert.\n\n\"I got to the point where I just had enough and I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong.\"\n\n(Image: BBC / Boundless)\n\nLubna admitted she was glad to leave the process as she was missing her two kids and \"struggling\" without her family.\n\nOn the rivalry in the house, she said: \"I would say the tension is always there. I personally felt a lot of paranoia.\n\n\"You don\u2019t have your phone and you don\u2019t know who these people you are living and competing with are.\n\n\"You don\u2019t know anything about them apart from their name. Even the stories they\u2019re telling you, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re making it up as it is a competition. I felt really paranoid and didn't know who to trust.\n\n\"I am an introvert so I really went into my shell, especially when people were screaming and shouting. I tried to be an observer.\n\n\"It's hard to live with people who could be working against you and trying to stitch you up.\"\n\nLubna admitted she held back because she is a qualified Chartered Accountant and was conscious of how she was going to be protrayed.\n\nShe admitted: \"I think I was too nice. I could have thrown people under the bus and grovelled to Lord Sugar but I didn't do those things as I'd planned to be myself in the process.\n\n\"Me overreacting or pretending to be someone else...I wouldn\u2019t have done justice to myself.\n\n\"I\u2019m actually quite proud of my performance. I don\u2019t think I let myself down and I stuck to my principles.\n\nLubna called out some of her fellow candidates for being fake, but admitted she understands why they were acting.\n\nShe added: \"I would say the majority were [acting] but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing as they understand they\u2019re playing a game.\n\n\"It is a TV show and you need to stand out. You\u2019ve got to play the game to win and do well in the process.\"\n\n*The Apprentice airs Wednesdays on BBC One at 9pm", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Fired candidate Lubna Farhan admitted Lottie Lion has a lot to learn on how to treat people after making 'racist' remarks", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Bbc", "Boundless"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20710367.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_The-Apprentice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
