I know the Institute is well equipped with a first rate team of staff and Trustees to continue it\u2019s progress in the future. I especially want to thank Cindy McCain and the McCain family for their selfless support of the institute.\u201d\n\nCindy McCain, widow of Sen. McCain, said in an additional statement:\n\nI want to thank Kurt Volker for his dedication and hard work in helping to build the McCain Institute into the results-driven, action-oriented institution that it is today. We are proud of these accomplishments and I especially appreciate his dedication to my husband and the entire McCain family.\n\nMcCain announced the Executive Committee of the Trustees has asked Fran Townsend to serve as Trustee Representative to the Institute to coordinate the transition to a new Executive Director.\n\nIn the meantime, Senior Director for National Security and Counterterrorism Programs and Professor of Practice at the ASU Sandra Day O\u2019Connor College of Law Nick Rasmussen has been asked by ASU leadership to serve as Acting Executive Director pending selection of a new Executive Director, McCain announced.\n\nThe announcement came after Volker testified to the House last week, and Democrats leaked text messages that showed Volker had assisted Trump administration efforts to get Ukraine to agree to help with the investigations.\n\nVolker stepped down shortly before that from his role as special envoy to Ukraine. He began that volunteer position in 2017.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Kurt Volker, former U.S. Special Representative to Ukraine, is stepping down as executive director of the McCain Institute.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/kurt-volker-capital-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
