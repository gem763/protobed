I wish him the best. We definitely need him in the league, he\u2019s definitely a big attraction in the league.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see anyone get hurt, especially like that. I hope everything is good and I hope he has a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid said after the game that didn\u2019t know how serious Mahomes\u2019 injury was, but added that, \u201cWe\u2019re good with whatever direction this thing goes.\u201d\n\nBackup Matt Moore threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill and the Chiefs (5-2) collected nine sacks, gave up a season-low 71 yards rushing and beat the Broncos (2-5) for the eighth straight time.\n\nHis balky left ankle heavily taped, Mahomes completed 10 of 11 passes for 76 yards and a touchdown, before getting injured on a successful sneak on fourth-and-inches at the Denver 5 early in the second quarter.\n\nOne by one, players peeled off the pile but when Mahomes didn\u2019t get up , the stadium grew quiet, Broncos players knelt and some Chiefs stormed away in aguish as their quarterback ripped off his helmet and covered his face.\n\nBroncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. went over to shake Mahomes\u2019 hand as he awaited medical help, his right knee stuck in an awkward angle.\n\n\u201cHopefully he\u2019s not too injured, for the season,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe\u2019s great for our league, he\u2019s a great player. So, hopefully he\u2019s not hurt too bad.\u201d\n\nAs players milled about nervously, the Chiefs\u2019 medical personnel appeared to pop Mahomes\u2019 right knee back in place before he was helped from the field and taken into the locker room.\n\n\u201cExcited for the win,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAt the same time, a guy like Patrick goes down it can be deflating.\u201d\n\nBefore he got hurt, Mahomes became the fastest player in NFL history to throw for 7,500 yards, in just his 25th game.\n\n\u201cYou feel for anybody that has something that looks like it may be pretty serious,\u201d Broncos quarterback Joe Flacco said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just other quarterbacks; that\u2019s everybody. But man, a young guy like that who\u2019s starting off his career the way he has and starting off this season the way he has, it\u2019s definitely not easy to watch guys go down with injuries like that. I hope that he\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\nMahomes, who has 15 TDs and one interception this season, didn\u2019t speak with reporters after the game but he did lead the team\u2019s \u201cbreakdown,\u201d in the winning locker room, praising Moore, who completed 10 of 19 passes for 117 yards, and the defense.\n\n\u201cJust seeing him in the locker room after the game, standing on his feet and just super optimistic about everything I think that shows one more time how strong of a man he is and how good of leader he is,\u201d said guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif. \u201cHe\u2019s said, \u2018I\u2019m going to get better, we\u2019re going to get this team back on track,\u2019 and it was great to just see him walk and smile at the end.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos had won two straight and were aiming to turn the AFC West upside down by handling the Chiefs their third straight loss. But the Chiefs, who were 24th in the league with just 11 sacks coming in, sacked Flacco a career-high eight times and held Denver\u2019s running back duo in check after allowing an average of 190 over their previous four games.\n\nWhen Flacco did stay upright to deliver deep passes, they fell incomplete. Rookie tight end Noah Fant dropped three passes that would have totaled more than 100 yards, and Denver converted just one of 13 third downs.\n\n\u201cThis is about as bad an offense as I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Fox NFL analyst Troy Aikman exclaimed at one point. \u201cI\u2019m shocked there\u2019s as many people still here at the game.\u201d\n\nFlacco, who was sacked five times and knocked down eight more times in 15 first-half drop-backs, was sack-stripped by linebacker Anthony Hutchins on the next series and linebacker Reggie Ragland scooped up the loose ball at the 5 and rumbled into the end zone for a 20-6 halftime lead.\n\nBUNGLING BRONCOS\n\nThe Chiefs even sacked punter Colby Wadman, who had nowhere to throw the ball on a failed fake punt that gave Kansas City the ball at the Broncos 38 on the drive that ended with Mahomes\u2019 injury.\n\nOther special teams follies included missing a 45-yard field goal, allowing a 37-yard punt return and failing to punch it in from a yard out on a 2-point conversion.\n\nSHORT-LIVED LEAD\n\nThe Broncos went ahead 7-0 when Royce Freeman took it in from a yard out. But Vic Fangio decided to take the extra point off the board and go for 2 when Alex Okafor was whistled for encroachment on the PAT.\n\n\u201cI thought it was worth the gamble,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nInstead of handing the ball off to Freeman again, Fangio had Phillip Lindsay, who\u2019s about 50 pounds lighter, pound the ball up the middle and he was stuffed, leaving the Chiefs celebrating.\n\nMahomes put Kansas City ahead on his first drive, somehow escaping Miller to fire a pass that safety Will Parks tipped but which Mecole Hardman reigned in anyway for a 21-yard score .\n\nINJURIES: Parks (hand) and teammate LB Justin Hollins (knee) left the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChiefs: Face the Green Bay Packers on Oct. 27.\n\nBroncos: Visit the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 27.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "DENVER (AP) \u2014 The Kansas City Chiefs rediscovered their mojo but lost their maestro.
