Our investment in the transport sector over the years has helped transform and improve the quality of life of millions of our people,\u201d he said.\n\nRamaphosa urged motorists to be extra vigilant on the country\u2019s roads, especially over the festive season.\n\nHe emphasised initiatives like transport month should be extended throughout the year: \u201cTo all of us as South Africans, let us take the 365 days much more seriously.\u201d\n\nThe president will also use the event to proclaim the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act, which he signed into law in August.\n\nAARTO CONSTITUTIONALLY FLAWED\n\nThe Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said governments Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) is constitutionally flawed and will be impossible to implement.\n\nThe Aarto Amendment Act includes a driver\u2019s demerit system, which means a motorist could end up losing their license if they violate a number of road rules.\n\nTransport Minister Fikile Mbalula announced that Aarto would be ready for implementation in June next year.\n\nBut Outa\u2019s Rudie Heyneke has doubts: \u201c\u2026On the other hand, we don\u2019t believe that that government will be ready. There is going to be rehabilitation programmes, there are going to be service providers, there is certain equipment that is going to be distributed throughout the country. Who is going to pay for that and how are they going to do that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Ramaphosa Appeals To SA To Rely More On Public Transport appeared first on iAfrica.com.", "description": "Ramaphosa Appeals To SA To Rely More On Public Transport", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE0C086_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
