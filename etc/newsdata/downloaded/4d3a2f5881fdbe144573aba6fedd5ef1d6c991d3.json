According to Met Office, the U.K.'s weather service, radar shows the thunderstorms were close to Cyprus, an island nation near Turkey.\n\nSuch storms are \"incredibly rare this far east in the Mediterranean,\" according to Met Office, which warned of flash flooding and rough seas.\n\nWe're monitoring this cluster of thunderstorms (the red splodges) close to Cyprus as a potential '#medicane' develops, something that is incredibly rare this far east in the Mediterranean.

That storm soon lost its hurricane-like appearance, but did cause flooding in Greece and parts of southern Europe.\n\nSince the air is drier in the eastern Mediterranean, medicanes are less common there and usually don't cause much wind damage, according to Berardelli. However, these storms can cause flooding, which the land in this region is not used to.\n\nThe developing medicane is forecast to make landfall on Saturday, dropping about one to four inches of rain in eastern Egypt and parts of Israel, Berardelli said. That is a lot of rain for the desert, considering the average annual rainfall in Cairo is about an inch. The storm will hit the coast just north of Cairo, and some areas will see a year's worth of rain in a day.\n\nCairo and other Egyptian cities have already received devastating rainfall this week, with severe flooding causing at least 11 deaths, the Associated Press reported.", "description": "Some areas may receive a year's worth of rain in one day", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/8cb3874d-3975-4030-bcfc-b900f8aa2a75/thumbnail/1200x630/6c199b864825ae901e8139205012e1c9/screen-shot-2019-10-25-at-11-16-42-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
