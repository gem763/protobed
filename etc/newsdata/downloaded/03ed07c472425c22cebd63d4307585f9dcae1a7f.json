We\u2019ll be out for as long as it takes to let the world know it is them who are destroying it.\u201d\n\nHong Kong is governed under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, which permits the city freedoms not available on the mainland such as an independent judiciary.\n\nDemonstrators are angry with Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s leader, for what they see as her pro-Beijing stance.\n\nCheung, 33-year-old protester, said Ms Lam was \u201cnot listening to us at all.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis may work in China but not in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nAfter a fortnight of relative calm, protests erupted again in the region on Saturday.\n\nMasked protesters barricaded multiple streets, by tearing stones from the pavement and scattering them on the road. Crowds also used plastic safety barriers and metal railings to form the makeshift barricades.\n\nThey also trashed hundreds of shops during the march, including a discount grocery chain, which they said were under pro-Beijing ownership. They also tried to set fire to metro stations and branches of Chinese banks, setting off sprinklers in two.\n\nMany demonstrators covered their faces in defiance of a new law barring them from wearing masks. They also sang the protest movement\u2019s anthem and held up placards which depicted China\u2018s flag as a Nazi swastika.\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, which organised the march despite not obtaining police approval, said around 350,000 protesters took part.\n\n\u201cYou can see Hong Kongers won\u2019t easily give up their right to demonstrate. Today\u2019s turnout is more than I expected,\u201d said Daniel Yeung, one of the activists taking part.\n\n\u201cYou can see that as long as people keep coming out in large numbers we are safe and can keep fighting,\u201d he added.\n\nPolice deployed several water cannon trucks to spray jets of blue-dye at protesters, which they use to identify demonstrators. Many people hit by the liquid also developed coughs, suggesting an irritant may be mixed with the water.\n\nOne water cannon sprayed a mosque in Kolwoon, an area in the city\u2019s north, covering the building in blue liquid.\n\nResidents jeered at riot police marching in the streets. Officers, in turn, told the people they were part of an illegal assembly.\n\nAs night fell the crowds set rubbish on fire in the middle of several streets and officers responded by firing yet more tear gas.\n\nThe crowds have five core demands: universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police action against protesters, amnesty for those charged, an end to describing protesters as rioters, and the formal withdrawal of a controversial bill allowing the extradition of prisoners to mainland China.\n\nThe bill triggered the protests earlier this summer. Ms Lam has declared the legislation abandoned but it is yet to be formally withdrawn.\n\nShe has rejected the other demands and on Sunday she said a police complaints inquiry will be completed before the end of the year.\n\nTwo people have been shot and wounded by police and thousands have been injured since the protests escalated in June.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nWhat Hong Kongers really think of the protesters and the police", "description": "Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters barricaded multiple streets in Hong Kong and clashed with police officers after two weeks of relative calm in the city.Tear gas was fired into the crowds as scores of police officers marched through the streets, after the march was declared illegal due to", "authors": ["Zamira Rahim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sMTpwwuFeuLDCBIsMDAEJw--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/d2465d5b9e183a771e651beaaa2f4882", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
