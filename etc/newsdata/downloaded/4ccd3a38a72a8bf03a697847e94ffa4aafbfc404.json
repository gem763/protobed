He told us the areas he's targeting and why he's excited about voice technology.", "language": "en", "text": "The Carlyle Group is partnering with Patrick Doyle, the former CEO of Domino's Pizza known for turning around its business by overhauling its recipe and implementing new technology like online ordering.\n\nDoyle, 56, is now a private-equity investor and will help Carlyle identify multibillion-dollar deals in the consumer and retail sectors.\n\nDoyle spoke with Business Insider about how companies could improve operations and said they would increasingly benefit from the use of voice technology.\n\nPatrick Doyle is best known for fixing Domino's Pizza's reputation as \"cardboard crust,\" lifting its stock price by changing its recipe and implementing tech changes like online ordering.\n\nDoyle, 56, who stepped down as Domino's CEO last year, now wants to apply what he learned at the pizza chain to a new role as a private-equity investor.\n\nThe Carlyle Group, one of the biggest private-equity firms, announced on Wednesday that it had struck up a partnership with Doyle in an effort to land multibillion-dollar deals in consumer and retail sectors in North America and Europe.\n\nRead more: Private-equity giant Carlyle is taking a majority stake in a startup that uses AI to judge how much you smile in interviews \u2014 and it could be the future of recruiting\n\nAfter spending some time vacationing in Montana last year, Doyle told Business Insider that he started speaking with firms at the beginning of 2019 and ultimately settled on Carlyle.\n\nGoing forward, Doyle will work exclusively with Carlyle to identify companies valued up to $10 billion that are prime for acquisition, and then help try to buy them in part with his own personal wealth.\n\nDoyle declined to specify how much money he'd be putting up but said it was \"very significant and it is a measure of my commitment to this.\"\n\nDoyle is looking at targeting companies that can benefit from technological innovation, and one trend he sees developing is the use of voice technology, he said.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs' push into private equity is ruffling feathers at Blackstone \u2014 and it might be a sign of big client skirmishes to come\n\nTouch screens, like those on mobile phones, will be viewed a decade or two from now as \"humorous\" and \"not a natural way to interact with technology,\" he said.\n\nBuying things with the sound of your voice is just easier, he said.\n\n\"I think we're going to see it growing quickly over time, getting things brought to people's homes or offices,\" Doyle said.\n\nIn joining Carlye, Doyle follows a well-trodden path of executives being tapped to help private-equity firms source deals.\n\nSuch arrangements between former corporate executives and private-equity firms have become common place as investors pour money into the private markets, valuations tick up, and firms roll out industry experts in bidding contests to stand out beyond price.\n\nIn today's market, as private-equity firms have billions in dry powder \u2014 or capital raised but not used \u2014 the roles are important as investors hammer firms about where they are putting their money and what teams they have on their rosters to land the best deals.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs execs are jockeying for control of the firm's lucrative private investing units after a plan to merge it \u2014 and the stakes couldn't be higher\n\n\"For the [investors], it used to be a nice-to-have,\" Andres Saenz, Ernst & Young's global private-equity leader, said of executive expertise in private-equity deals generally. \"Now [the investors] are deliberately asking, who are you hiring? What are you doing? For fundraising, it's sort of mandatory that you have thought this through.\"\n\nUnlike some other executives who work with private-equity firms as \"executive partners,\" though, Doyle's role will not focus on improving existing portfolio companies but finding new ones.\n\nDoyle acknowledged the challenges of putting capital to work in a competitive market. But he believed that his insights from his tenure at Domino's would differentiate himself and Carlyle and that he could see himself investing in anywhere between two to four companies alongside the firm at a given time.\n\n\"I'm on one public board, lead director at Best Buy \u2014 and that's it,\" he said. \"I'm going to be focusing entirely on this and on potential acquisitions we can make together.\"", "description": "Patrick Doyle spoke with Business Insider about how companies could improve operations and said they would increasingly benefit from voice technology.", "authors": ["Casey Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6ff9632e22af526163f248?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
