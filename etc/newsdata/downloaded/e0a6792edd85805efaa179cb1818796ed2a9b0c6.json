What is it good for? Absolutely nothing, and a convenient plot for The King\u2019s Man. As a prequel to our favorite film series about British gents running around in bespoke suits, a.k.a. Kingsman, this spy flick takes us back a century, where the world\u2019s worst tyrants and criminal masterminds, lead by Rasputin, are planning to band together to kill millions of people across the world, all because, well, that\u2019s sort of their thing. Our new hero to stop it all is a former army officer played by Ralph Fiennes, who guides a young recruit (Harris Dickinson) to be his backup. \u201cReputation is what people think of you,\u201d he explains. \u201cCharacter is what you are.\u201d Though, if you can get a reputation as the guy who saved the planet, that\u2019s pretty great too. The King\u2019s Man, which also stars Gemma Arterton, Dijimon Hounsou and Tom Hollander, will be released on February 14.\n\nRelated", "description": "Ralph Fiennes stars in \u201cThe King\u2019s Man,\u201d the prequel to the very popular film series \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/29-Rasputin.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
