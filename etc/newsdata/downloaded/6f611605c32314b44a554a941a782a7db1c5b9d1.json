Here are my 3 tricks for getting ahead.", "language": "en", "text": "I've had a lot of jobs in the 33 years I've been alive.\n\nI used to be a cocktail server. I also worked as a hostess, a steakhouse server, a Mexican-restaurant server, a newspaper intern, and a barista.\n\nAmanda Frances. Courtesy of Amanda Frances\n\nI've worked at a bookstore, a jewelry store, a cable company, a sheet-metal company, a church, an inner-city school (as a therapist), and a family-counseling center (as a play-therapist).\n\nMy longest-running job, however, was as a nanny to a few wealthy families in the wildly affluent Highland Park, Texas. Through my undergraduate studies in psychology, while I earned a master's degree in counseling, and well into the Ph.D. that I eventually left behind to start and grow my business, I burped babies, cooked chicken nuggets for snack time, and folded someone else's downy-soft Egyptian-cotton bath towels.\n\nI spent the rest of my waking hours hanging flyers for my life-coaching business on every bulletin board at every Starbucks in Dallas every day, working with the early clients those flyers brought me, and trying to piece enough money together to pay my rent and create the life I wanted. I built my first website myself by reading very non-blonde-girl-friendly message boards and watching how-to YouTube videos. There were many all-nighters as I taught myself internet marketing, online branding, and digital content creation, but I was determined.\n\nBy the time I graduated with my master's degree and dropped out of my Ph.D. program, I had a couple hundred thousand dollars in student-loan debt and no money in savings, and I had gotten enough of a taste of entrepreneurship through my baby life-coaching business that I knew I absolutely could not work for someone else. I was afraid \u2014 really, really afraid \u2014 of failure, but I had a hunch that I could do this. I had to figure out how to make money and make a difference.\n\nIt's been five years since I quit my Ph.D. program and five years and three months since I launched my first digital course. Today, Amanda Frances Inc. is a multimillion-dollar company that provides unique business-development and personal-development courses to hundreds of thousands of women, teaching them how to launch their own online businesses and empowering them to design lives and businesses they love. I am completely self-taught when it comes to the technology, marketing, branding, and messaging sides of my business. My company grossed nearly $3 million in revenue last year and earned $1 million in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nCatapulting my life from being a nanny from Sand Springs, Oklahoma, to a multimillionaire CEO living in Malibu, California, while running the company of my dreams might seem like a far-fetched, meteoric rise based on pure luck and chance, but if there's one thing I know for certain it's this: You can have the life you've designed in your dreams, every single bit of it.\n\nLots of people like to ask me what mentors I had, what business books I read. Who did I follow? I have never read a single business book or taken a business course. I don't listen to podcasts. I simply chose (and continue to choose) to learn how to master my own wealth and destiny, and then teach other women to do the same.\n\nHere are my three best and biggest pieces of advice for moving your vision forward and achieving your dreams.", "description": "Amanda Frances said she went from dropping out of a Ph.D. program to running her own multimillion-dollar business.", "authors": ["Amanda Frances"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d70109d2e22af4ec272c8ef-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
