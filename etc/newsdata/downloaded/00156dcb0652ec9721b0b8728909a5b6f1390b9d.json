After Rapper\u2019s Delight took over the radio waves at the end of the 1970s, New York became the superheated centre of this brave new sound. Throughout the \u201980s, hip-hop remained largely a localised scene. Turntablists like DJ Kool Herc were scratching and spinning records in the Bronx, Run DMC were making rock-influenced tracks in Queens, and Kurtis Blow was spitting narrative rhymes up in Harlem.\n\nThe 1990s saw an explosion of the sound across the US. Every region developed their own sonic signature, from the kaleidoscopically funky tracks that Virginia-native Missy Elliott dropped to the chopped and screwed rhythms of Port Arthur, TX\u2019s UGK and the soul-and-gospel inflected rhymes of Chicago\u2019s Common. (The year 1990 was also the first time a hip-hop song took the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Sadly, it was Vanilla Ice\u2019s Ice Ice Baby.)\n\nWhen the Millennium arrived, hip-hop started to creep into the mainstream narrative around pop culture. The sound was everywhere, as the green shoots of its international rise were beginning to show, with artists like MIA. and Dizzee Rascal becoming international stars.\n\nThe past decade has entrenched hip hop as not only a permanent part of pop culture, but as pop culture itself. Hip-hop is how people speak about themselves from Kashmir to California. The genre that was once so tightly defined has started endless branches of new genres. Hip-hop doesn\u2019t just belong to the Bronx anymore. It\u2019s everywhere.\n\nAs a result, we felt it was the right time to ask critics around the world what they think are the greatest hip-hop songs of all time. No surprises to see that almost all of the 280 songs nominated in total are from US artists. But we also received nominations for songs originating outside the US. As the purpose of these lists should be to encourage discovery as well as debate, we thought we would put together a list of the critic\u2019s picks from around the world to create a global playlist. Here are the standouts from the critics\u2019 picks that show hip-hop\u2019s five decades of growth into a global phenomenon.\n\nShinjitsu No Dangan, King Giddra (1995)\n\nJust because international hip-hop didn\u2019t hit the big time until the noughties doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t artists trying to bring the genre to their own shores. King Giddra \u2013 not to be confused with MF DOOM\u2019s alias King Gheedorah \u2013 was a Japanese group which took political cues from groups like Public Enemy, highlighting the stark economic reality for many Japanese people in the shadow of a deep recession. Musically, Shinjitsu No Dangan (Bullet of Truth) is a mixture of East coast boom-bap and the rock-tinged sound of Cypress Hill. Production-wise it may not be terribly innovative, but the song is full of fire.\n\nJe Danse Le Mia, IAM (1994)\n\nIf you ask any hip-hop head where the best non-English rap hails from, the answer is invariably France. IAM came to prominence in the early \u201990s, taking equal cues from New Jack Swing and R&B. Je Danse Le Mia reached number one in France, and stayed there for weeks, inspiring a whole new generation of hip-hop artists who saw that the genre had star-making potential. The song toes the line between goofy and infectious, with a funk-injected beat that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in the 1970s.\n\nI Luv U, Dizzee Rascal (2003)\n\nWhether grime is hip-hop or not is a debate that still rages today, but no one can argue that Dizzee Rascal brought the uniquely English genre to the world\u2019s stage. The beat and flow of Dizzee\u2019s hit is proto-grime, all aggressive jungle and garage beats over rapid-fire rhymes that still sound smooth at 140bpm. I Luv U didn\u2019t start grime, but it did catapult it into the public consciousness.\n\nSoweto, Pro Kid (2005)\n\nThere are rappers that put entire cities on the map. Think Meek Mill and Philadelphia or Drake and Toronto. Soweto\u2019s Pro Kid was another one of these, popularising a regional hip-hop style born and bred in the famed Johannesburg suburb. Soweto has all the triumphant swagger of Jay-Z or Rick Ross rhyming over a vintage Just Blaze beat, but Pro Kid also brought a distinctive vocabulary of Sowetan slang and vernacular to the table, creating something sublime in the process.\n\nHow to Rap About Africa, Black Vulcanite (2016)\n\nIn 2005, Kenyan author and journalist Binyavanga Wainaina wrote a satiric essay labeled How to Write About Africa. It became a landmark piece of criticism, lampooning those who would come to the continent and follow a tired formula that highlighted stereotypical narratives about poverty, genocide, and corruption. A decade later, the Namibian group Black Vulcanite put Wainaina\u2019s essay to music, giving it a seething beat that takes cues from iconic producers like DJ Premier and Madlib. The resulting track, How to Rap About Africa, is less tongue-in-cheek and more caustically critical, bringing the anti-establishment fire of Public Enemy and Dead Prez to a whole new era and geography.\n\nSub City, Stogie T (2016)\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s hip-hop scene is one of the world\u2019s most mature, and it has produced some of the most artistically gifted MCs this side of Queens. But even in that crowded field, Stogie T stands apart. The 38-year old MC famously flexed his skills on radio show Sway in the Morning, spitting a flawless freestyle over the beat from Nas\u2019s NY State of Mind. It was a star-making moment, but Stogie T has been rhyming since the turn of the millennium, including the standout track Sub City from his eponymous 2016 album.\n\nNgqangqa, Kanyi (2017)\n\nAs hip hop became a dominant musical force, it also became an outlet for those seeking to keep their own oral and narrative traditions alive in an era of cultural homogenisation. Kanyi Mavi, an MC hailing from Cape Town, raps in Xhosa \u2013 a language spoken by more than eight million South Africans that contains distinctive \u201cclick\u201d consonants. Mavi\u2019s rapping is studded with those clicks, giving the austere, gritty beat on her 2017 track Ngqangqa another layer that would be impossible to add using another language.\n\nFight da Faida, Frankie Hi-NRG MC (1993)\n\nItaly may not be the first country you think of when it comes to hip-hop, but Frankie Hi-NRG MC has been in the game as long as legendary acts like Common and UGK. His debut single is as politically charged as any Public Enemy track, railing against the influence of the mafia in Sicily on a sparse, springy beat centered around a Sly and the Family Stone sample. Frankie does his best Ice Cube impression on Fight da Faida, knowing that understated style can be the most devastating way to deliver a rhyme.\n\nAtrevido, Orishas (2000)\n\nMost of the songs on this list sound like American hip-hop. Atrevido, a track from Cuban rap group Orishas, doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s hip-hop by artists intimately familiar with Cuba\u2019s manifold musical traditions, from rumba to bolero to jazz, yielding a sound that could fit comfortably into any number of genres. Orishas\u2019 ability to shape shift and blend heritage with modern tastes has inspired artists from Bad Bunny to Camilla Cabello, and made the Caribbean one of the modern powerhouses of contemporary hip-hop.\n\nMore on BBC Music\u2019s greatest hip-hop songs of all time:\n\nThe 25 greatest hip-hop songs of all time\n\nWhat critics had to say about the top 10\n\nFull list of critics who participated \u2013 and how they voted\n\nWhy Juicy is number one (not available in UK)\n\nTrends and surprises in the poll (not available in UK)\n\nWhy are there so few women in hip-hop polls?
