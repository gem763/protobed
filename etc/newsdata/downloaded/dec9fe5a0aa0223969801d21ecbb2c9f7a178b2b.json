Leicester romped into a 5-0 half-time lead after Ryan Bertrand was sent off in just the 12th minute.\n\nLeicester are up to second place, perhaps dreaming of a repeat of their 2016 title. \u201cManchester City, we\u2019re coming for you,\u201d their jubilant fans chanted on a night in which both Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy scored hat-tricks.\n\nFriday night\u2019s decisive moment came early on and is one that Southampton, and Bertrand in particular, will be desperate to forget.\n\nThe hosts were caught in possession and Leicester worked the ball to Chilwell down the left. The England full-back found Harvey Barnes, whose low shot was parried by Angus Gunn.
