It also said that, even if member firms of the governing Libra Association addressed regulatory concerns, it may not get approval from the necessary regulators, stating:\n\n\"The G7 believe that no stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed. [...] Addressing such risks is not necessarily a guarantee of regulatory approval for a stablecoin arrangement.\"\n\nThe G7 also states that global stablecoins with the potential to scale rapidly could stifle competition and threaten financial stability if users lose confidence in the coin.\n\nThe report will purportedly be presented to finance ministers at an annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund this week.\n\nFurther problems for Libra?\n\nThe BBC states that, while the report does not single out Facebook\u2019s proposed Libra stablecoin project, it could spell further trouble for the already beleaguered proposed payments system.\n\nGlobal regulators are increasingly leaning on the project, with the Bank of England recently establishing provisions with which it must comply before it can be issued in the United Kingdom.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee about Libra later this month. The head of the committee, Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, has been a noted critic of the project. Earlier this year, the committee drafted the \u201cKeep Big Tech out of Finance Act.\u201d\n\nLibra has seen several major partner firms of its governing consortium leave the project recently. On Oct. 4, major payments network PayPal withdrew from the organization and was soon followed by Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay.\n\nFurthermore, Finco Services of Delaware initiated a lawsuit against Facebook, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and \u201cfalse designation of origin\u201d regarding the use of the Libra logo. The plaintiff is also suing its former designer, who did the logo work for Facebook, for reusing the design.", "description": "Report: G7 Says \u2018Global Stablecoins\u2019 Pose Threat to Financial Stability | News by Cointelegraph", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5ldS1jZW50cmFsLTEuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMTktMTAvMmZhNGU1OGItMzVlMS00YmNkLTlkMGYtODJhNzgxZjM1YTdjLmpwZw==.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
