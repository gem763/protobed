The series debuted in Japan in 1997 and arrived in the United States a year later. For more than 1,000 episodes and 22 feature films, the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" animated series has followed Ash's travels around the fictional world as he encounters hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon and battles his fellow trainers.\n\nTo become a Pok\u00e9mon Master, trainers must win a tournament against the toughest competition in their region, called the Pok\u00e9mon League. After coming up short in six Pok\u00e9mon League tournaments, Ash captured his first championship in the Alola region against a rival trainer named Gladion.\n\nSurprisingly, it wasn't Ash's Pikachu who won the final battle. He used Lycanroc, a wolf Pok\u00e9mon, to defeat Gladion's Lycanroc in a fight that came down to the last hit. The episode aired in Japan on Sunday but hasn't officially been translated to English.\n\nRead more: A rare Pok\u00e9mon card worth $60,000 got lost in the mail, and the seller is offering a $1,000 bounty for its return\n\n\"Pok\u00e9mon\" has only continued to grow in popularity in the past two decades, and Ash's journey has touched millions of people around the world. While his failure to win the Pok\u00e9mon League had become a running joke among fans through the years, Ash's victory sparked celebration around social media.\n\nThe \"Pok\u00e9mon\" director and composer Junichi Masuda retweeted messages of support from countries including Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Australia. Fans said Ash's persistence through the years should serve as a reminder that success could be a long journey.\n\nDespite being on the air for more than two decades, Ash hasn't really aged since the start of the series \u2014 he's been 10 years old since 1997.\n\nIt's unclear whether the next season of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" anime will replace Ash with a different protagonist, but the Pok\u00e9mon champion will still have plenty to do on his own adventures \u2014 after all, he's still gotta catch 'em all.", "description": "For more than 20 years, the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" animated series has followed Ash Ketchum's quest to become a Pok\u00e9mon Master.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7f92f52e22af045e103973-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
