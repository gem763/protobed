The microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, can lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs and the bloodstream. They cause irritation, inflammation and can lead to respiratory problems, while longer term exposure can even cause cancer and heart attack.\n\nResearchers at the University of Cincinnati and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center examined psychiatric patient visits, and then traced the concentration of PM2.5 in their residential areas. Researchers found that whenever there were increases in PM2.5, there would be more psychiatric visits within the following few days.\n\nRead More", "description": "Air pollution may be associated with increased mental health disorders like anxiety and depression in children, a study has found.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926123944-china-pollution-child-super-tease.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
