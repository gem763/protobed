Conservatives Don\u2019t.", "language": "en", "text": "Joe Biden often reminds audiences that President Donald Trump once said the white supremacists who marched around Charlottesville chanting \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d were \u201cvery fine people.\u201d But in August, when the former vice president made this point at the Iowa State Fair, an editor from Breitbart was waiting to confront him. For weeks, Joel Pollak had hounded Biden, accusing him of spreading a hoax about Charlottesville. \u201cAre you aware that you\u2019re misquoting Donald Trump?\u201d Pollak asked at the fair. \u201cHe never called neo-Nazis very fine people.\u201d\n\nTrump never uttered that exact phrase, but during his press conference at Trump Tower three days after the rally, he did say there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the confrontation. At the time, conservatives downplayed it, but two years after Charlottesville, they have moved on to denying it ever happened. Scott Adams, the creator of the comic Dilbert, harnessed his skills as a \u201ctrained hypnotist\u201d on his podcast this March to demonstrate that the scandal was a \u201cfalse memory,\u201d a kind of nationwide collective delusion. In August, the phony academic outlet Prager University published a viral video calling the \u201cvery fine people\u201d controversy a hoax. Trump retweeted the clip. Meanwhile, Pollak has earned a reputation in Trumpian circles as a righteous truth-teller; in August, after the scuffle with Biden in Iowa, Rush Limbaugh praised Pollak for \u201ctraveling around trying to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that conservative media outlets play fast and loose with facts, but by claiming that Trump\u2019s Charlottesville gaffe never happened, they are actively working to destabilize the public\u2019s recollection. In doing so, they\u2019re exploiting a distinctly postmodern turn in political commentary. Pundits paraphrase so much of what Trump says and tweets that it\u2019s easy to forget the substance of these utterances and outbursts. Add to this Trump\u2019s habit of rephrasing his own statements and you\u2019re further from anything resembling reality: Just last month, he declared he was \u201cthe chosen one,\u201d before saying he was only kidding; a few weeks earlier, he had joked \u201cToo bad!\u201d when Elijah Cummings\u2019s house was broken into, only to deny that he ever made light of the incident. Trump sees facts as fundamentally malleable\u2014after all, he has claimed the notorious Access Hollywood tape that caught him bragging about sexual assault was doctored\u2014so it only makes sense that his boosters in the media would realize anything he says can be modified, distorted, or simply erased after the fact. When the man you support is unambiguous about where his loyalties lie, it\u2019s easier to reply, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d", "description": "Why \"Dilbert\" creator Scott Adams, a Breitbart editor, and others claim the president's \"very fine people\" remark is a \"false memory\"", "authors": ["Jake Bittle"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ec1a005e321f0f3a5fb88010de724a4d1b35f2ff.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
