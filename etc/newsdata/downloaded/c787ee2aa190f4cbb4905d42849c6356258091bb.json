However, an Inter supporter group released a statement saying that the chants were not racist.\n\nKoulibably defended his club fans in L'Equipe by saying: 'The Napoli fans could never have written a letter like the one Inter supporters sent Lukaku because there's so much love here.\n\n'How can they say that jeers aren't acts of racism? It's obvious that we're discriminated against due to the colour of our skin.\n\n'I'd like to see these people go through what we do. It really hurts. The rules exist and I know them, but there are still some problems applying them.\n\n'I haven't seen any fans banned from stadiums yet, neither have I seen any heavy fines or points docked. A strong precedent needs to be set.'", "description": "Kalidou Koulbaly insists there is no racism in Naples and that 'there is only love'.
