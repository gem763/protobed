Yesterday was a ball, at least for remainers. But it was like the Duchess of Richmond\u2019s ball before Waterloo; now, the real battle must commence. The supreme court did not rewrite the UK\u2019s constitution on Tuesday, it merely enforced the conventions of the existing one. It reasserted, \u201cBe ye never so high, the law is above you\u201d \u2013 though it cited no particular law, rather the \u201crule of law\u201d as interpreted by itself.\n\nThe person who should be resigning is the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, for inducing the monarch to collude in a political device. We can only imagine how pompously he would now be demanding resignation were the culprit not him.\n\nIf Johnson was shrewd, he would, in the name of unity, summon an elder statesman like Ken Clarke\n\nAs legality recedes, politics returns. Today parliament has been handed back its bruised sovereignty and must decide what to do with it. Enter the law of unintended consequences. Brexit on 31 October is still European law, pending its extension under parliament\u2019s recent legislation against a no-deal Brexit act. The supreme court ruling has no effect on this. Indeed, the court\u2019s unequivocal, almost gleeful judgment \u2013 clearly motivated by Johnson\u2019s arrogant refusal to argue his case \u2013 has deepened the entrenched divide in British politics.\n\nThis may yet prove helpful to Johnson. The rightwing press, speaking for hardcore leavers everywhere, sees remainers under every bed. It paints the judges as stormtroopers for remain, \u201cenemies of the people\u201d and tools of the metropolitan elite. In its eyes, the prime minister is onside against the establishment. Good on him.\n\nJohnson is still in reckless mode, wedded to Trumpian belligerence and brinkmanship. But to deplore this strategy does not render it implausible. Unless the Commons coheres behind an alternative leader or party grouping \u2013 of which it seems tribally incapable \u2013 Johnson remains prime minister. The Commons dares not even vote no confidence in him. If he lurches on into October without a deal, he or someone in the government\u2019s name must ask Brussels to delay Brexit into the winter. When that is agreed, as it surely would be, an election would become unavoidable. Johnson would plead for a mandate again to \u201cdeliver Brexit, do or die\u201d, blaming all and sundry for stopping him. With his enemies divided, he would probably win.\n\nThe one alternative is a deal along the lines already agreed by Theresa May, and rejected time and again by the foolish Commons. Events have moved on. If Johnson was shrewd, he would await the end of his conference next week and, in the name of unity, summon an elder statesman such as Ken Clarke. He would license such a figure to forge a cross-party agreement based on the May deal, sweetened by pleading with Brussels for a new form of words governing an Irish border. Here negotiators are still playacting. Such a deal is feasible.\n\nJohnson faces political humiliation, but that will play well with some voters | Katy Balls Read more\n\nThe UK could then leave the EU on 31 October with a withdrawal agreement and enter a transition period, with all options (other than remain) on the table. It would honour the referendum. For Tory leavers it would be the least worst outcome. The political climate would instantly shift. Johnson, proclaiming himself \u201cdeliverer of the will of the people\u201d, could romp home at a subsequent election.\n\nI cannot imagine a worse prime minister to be leading the country just now. But that is not the issue, any more than whether Johnson broke the law. If he can keep his nerve, this could yet be his hour of pain before an electoral dawn. Forget the judges. Only the short term matters. The true maxim is: be you never so self-righteous, politics is above you.\n\n\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist", "description": "No matter how arrogant and incompetent he is, no matter that he broke the law, the supreme court ruling can work in his favour, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins", "authors": ["Simon Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba339903ec81a4d7a11525ab8b4532e8eeb34b46/0_0_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dcfed04ce4dfc21069025bc3f364d7b6", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
