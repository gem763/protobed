After these existentially wrenching books, he stated he would move away from writing about war.\n\nConflict also drives Deep River, an imposing novel about Finnish immigrants in America, but it is the struggle of Aino Koski, of her brothers and of the emerging American labour movement. There is also the clash of humans with wild nature in the logging and salmon fishing industries of the Pacific Northwest, and the intrinsic conflict of siblings against siblings, and wives against husbands.\n\nInspired by Marlantes\u2019s own family ancestry, Deep River is a massive American saga, a historical epic of documentary detail spread across the early 20th century \u2013 and 700 pages. We witness the traumas of Aino as a sort of proto-Rosa Luxemburg, who with her brothers escaped tsarist persecution and deadly poverty in Finland for America. Aino\u2019s brother Matti is a tough, aspiring businessman who embraces the Darwinian crudity of American capitalism; their brother Ilmari builds a church and also explores the lore and spirituality of Native Americans. The themes of idealism, materialism and God, guiding forces of America itself, are personified in this one family. There is also Askel, a childhood friend and fisherman who has a long, complex relationship with Aino.\n\nThe novel is a stalwart refresher on how tough life must have been when to post two letters on union business cost more than a week\u2019s wages. As well as Aino\u2019s story, this is a chronicle of the \u201cWobblies\u201d, the Industrial Workers of the World union, in a period when conflict between workers and the status quo in the US was violent and naked.\n\nThe book\u2019s flaw is not the earnestness of its political story, but its narration. From Robert Graves to Ernst J\u00fcnger, James Salter to Michael Herr to Marlantes himself, the horror and fear of combat electrifies the simplest prose with huge tension and brutal significance. In Deep River, little of that gripping intensity is present; extensive sections of a long book feel perfunctory. Marlantes writes almost wholly in accessible, unchallenging prose, pretty much stripped of description: \u201cRauha\u2019s face settled once again into its cold mask.\u201d Men are \u201clike ants in a vast landscape\u201d. Without the energy and anticipation of a combat scenario behind it, it only has the exhaustive agenda of spelling out every significant event that happens to the Koski siblings. Chapters lack dramatic tension. Impoverished Makki seeks the beautiful Kyllikki as his bride \u2013 the affluent parents object, but determined and wily Makki outfoxes them. You see it coming.\n\nThere's a sense of documentary-like facts being adumbrated and ticked off, qualified by the dates on which they occurred\n\nThere is an accumulating sense of documentary-like facts being adumbrated and ticked off, qualified by the helpful dates on which they occurred. Readers are told lots of dry information, rather than being permitted to experience these facts through the story, so we get plain, clunky exposition: \u201cThe Swedish-speaking and Finnish-speaking communities kept pretty much to themselves but with written material in both languages becoming common as well as increasing literacy among the younger people, it didn\u2019t surprise her that Askel \u2026 \u201d\n\nThe logging sequences contain fascinating detail and a lovely set piece when whole residential log huts are loaded by crane on to a train, transported to the next felling zone then offloaded on the rough ground \u2013 of course never resting level, so that Aino\u2019s ankles ache from walking uphill within her own house. Marlantes is quite capable of wonderful stuff like this. However, logging is already a rich fictional mini-genre: Annie Proulx\u2019s magnificent Barkskins, Tim Gautreaux\u2019s The Clearing, Ken Kesey\u2019s Sometimes a Great Notion, Robin Jenkins\u2019s The Cone Gatherers, David Adams Richards\u2019s The Friends of Meager Fortune, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s The Word for World Is Forest. They all leave far more powerful impressions of foresting \u2013 or, more accurately, the uneasy emotional impact of deforestation \u2013 than Deep River does.\n\nWe learn and grow from the novel, and many will embrace its long-term company and businesslike storytelling. Through girth and plenitude, hefty books often attempt to grab status. Marlantes is far too sincere a writer to be accused of that; yet I believe a shorter book might have given this story so much more power.\n\n\u2022 Alan Warner\u2019s next novel, Kitchenly 434, will be published in 2020.
