Video of the shooting spread quickly on the internet. Thankfully, the student is stabilized.\n\nThe shot itself represented the sharpest uptick in violence since the protests began.

The shot was reportedly fired amid a standoff in which protesters allegedly hit security officials with metal pipes, while others are said to have swarmed, tackled, and beat up another riot officer.\n\nIn addition to that incident, many news agencies reported an overall uptick in violence, with protesters throwing gasoline bombs in subway stations, throwing rocks at windows, and damaging private property.\n\nRegardless of the circumstances that led to the 18-year-old student protester getting shot, though not fatally, many in Hong Kong and the international community will see this as a clear-cut case of police brutality and a misuse of force.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Beware Beijing: Everyone is watching you now.", "authors": ["Olivia Enos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QqPwtOnHgFM_9IVz_o2UTg--~B/aD05MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/eb1bd3dcab570ea63171be1464872c30", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
