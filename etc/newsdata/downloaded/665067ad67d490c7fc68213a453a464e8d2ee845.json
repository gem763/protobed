Nearly two decades later, the threats have significantly evolved \u2013 and DHS has evolved to counter them.\n\nForeign terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and al-Qaida, are still intent on striking the country and remain a key focus of DHS\u2019s counterterrorism efforts. The country is also facing a growing threat from domestic terrorism and targeted violence here at home. In order to address and prevent the mass attacks that have too frequently struck our houses of worship, our schools, our workplaces, our festivals, and our shopping spaces, while continuing to target, pursue, and prevent attacks from our traditional terrorist adversaries, DHS will implement a new strategy.\n\nOn September 20, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan will introduce and frame DHS\u2019s Strategy for Countering Terrorism and Targeted Violence at an event co-hosted by Heritage and the Brookings Institution, explaining how the department will use the tools and expertise that have protected and strengthened the country from foreign terrorist organizations in the past to confront the current and emerging threats of today, tomorrow, and beyond.\n\nQuestions from the audience will follow.\n\nSign up to receive invitations to all public events.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-648776440.jpg?itok=vyBvpAvb", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
