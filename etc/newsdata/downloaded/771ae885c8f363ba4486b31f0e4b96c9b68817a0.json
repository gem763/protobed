Rumours of a return for Kenobi had been circling for years prior.\n\nAnd speaking on Lorraine, McGregor seemed relieved that the secret was finally out.\n\nThe last tie we saw Kenobi was in 2005\u2019s Revenge of the Sith (Picture: Rex)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been a long time coming,\u2019 he said. \u2018I feel like I\u2019ve been touting for the part \u2013 \u201cremember me?

He last made a voice-only cameo in 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens.\n\n\u2018I was in my 20s, so it was a long while ago,\u2019 the actor continued. \u2018Now I\u2019m much closer in age to Alec when he played [Obi-Wan]. Not too close\u2026but I\u2019m getting there!\u2019\n\nThe new spin-off will fill fans in on Kenobi\u2019s exploits between the end of Revenge of the Sith and his re-appearance in A New Hope.\n\nThe arrival of an Obi-Wan Kenobi spin-off is hot on the heels of the first Star Wars spin-off to hit Disney+, The Mandalorian.\n\nThe inaugural show for Disney\u2019s new streaming service will arrive on 12 November and its first episode of the show will include a major spoiler for the Star Wars Universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcGregor\u2019s newest film, Doctor Sleep, will be hitting cinemas on 31 October, with rave reviews as the best Stephen King adaption since The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nLorraine airs weekdays from 8.35 on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
