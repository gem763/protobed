He is exploiting his office and making official U.S. government decisions for his personal financial gain,\u201d Nalder said in a statement. \u201cThe Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution exist to prevent exactly this kind of corruption. The Committee will continue investigating, litigating and legislating regarding these matters\u2014including pressing for answers to our prior requests about the G7 selection process\u2014but we will not allow this latest abuse of power to distract from Congress\u2019 efforts to get to the bottom of the President\u2019s interference in the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced the decision at a White House news conference on Thursday, saying, \u201cit was almost like they built this facility\u201d to host the annual event. Mulvaney dismissed concerns that hosting the summit at the Trump property violates any ethics rules.\n\nPresident Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t profit from being here, he has no interest in profiting from being here,\u201d he explained to reporters, noting that it will host the event at \u201ccost.\u201d \u201cDoral was by far and away, by far and away the best physical location,\u201d he added\n\nThe summit, attended by the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, will take place June 10th-12th in 2020.", "description": "House Democrats are expected to vote in favor of a measure condemning Trump's decision to hold the next G-7 summit at his resort.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trump-National-Doral-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
