The DA's financial committee has cleared Maimane of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"There are only a few individuals who cannot win an argument at all in structures provided for in the party. They simply want to go run it in public \u2026 we will not surrender that war, we will not stay back,\" Maimane told News24 in an interview.\n\n'Committed to the battle'\n\n\"We are continuing to fight for the future of this party, and I'm certainly committed to the battle in whatever form it takes,\" he added.\n\nAccording to sources high up in the party, there is a possibility that more scandals involving Maimane will emerge as the DA prepares for its crucial federal council meeting on Friday, when the election of a new federal council chairperson is also expected to take place.\n\nThe Weekend Argus reported that a group of mainly white leaders was forcing Maimane out, unhappy with his combative approach towards President Cyril Ramaphosa, fearing that it could open up the path for his deputy David Mabuza to succeed him.\n\nInsiders close to Maimane claimed to News24 that the so-called 1959 committee will attempt to create a parallel structure to undermine Maimane. It's also seen as a factional structure seeking to institutionalise divisions in the DA.\n\nMaimane said he was not surprised that some in the DA were opposed to the direction in which he was steering the party, but he put this down to a few individuals.\n\n\"If you are a political leader and you want everybody in the party to be happy, then give all the people ice-cream, but actually, if you want to bring change, you're going to have people who oppose the change,\" he said.\n\n- Compiled by Jenna Etheridge\n\n\n\n", "description": "Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane has been asked to quit for the sake of the party, as several leaders have claimed that a right-wing element in the DA is behind a 'smear campaign' against him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8774/f3a1726edfda4bae99f26b6231e1f584.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
