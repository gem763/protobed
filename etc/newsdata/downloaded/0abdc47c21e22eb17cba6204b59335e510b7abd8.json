Adam Schiff (Calif.), chair of the House Intelligence Committee; Eliot Engel (N.Y.), chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Elijah Cummings (Md.), who chairs the House Oversight and Reform Committee had subpoenaed Giuliani on Sept. 30. He had until Tuesday to hand over the requested documents.\n\nThe subpoena demanded that Giuliani produce documents pertaining to Trump\u2019s pressuring of the president of Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn their letter, the three chairs noted Giuliani had admitted on CNN that he asked the Ukrainian government find damaging information about Biden, whom Trump may face off against in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIn addition to this stark admission, you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence \u2015 in the form of text messages, phone records, and other communications \u2015 indicating that you were not acting alone and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThey also warned that a refusal to comply could constitute evidence that Giuliani was attempting to obstruct the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and \u201cmay be used as an adverse inference against you and the president.\u201d\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget also said Tuesday through a spokeswoman it would defy the congressional subpoena, according to CNN.\n\nGiuliani separately told CNN on Tuesday he was parting ways with Sale.\n\n\u201cJon was helping me with assessing [the] congressional request,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cHe will submit his letter and he will be finished with what I asked him to do.\u201d\n\nRead Sale\u2019s full letter below:\n\nLove HuffPost?
