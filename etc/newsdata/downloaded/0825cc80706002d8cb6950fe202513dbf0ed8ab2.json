(AP) - A landmark sign from Bozeman\u2019s old Starlite drive-In theater has been returned to its owner after it was stolen last month.\n\nThe Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported Saturday the second half of the two-piece \u201cStarlite\u201d sign was taken from outside Media Station Design Works, which specializes in making signs and artwork.\n\nOwner Ole Nelson contacted police, who found the sign in the possession of two college students. Nelson says both wrote him to apologize. It wasn\u2019t clear if they face charges.\n\nThe sign was resting on the ground when the part that said \u201clite\u201d was stolen. Nelson plans to mount it on the wall so it\u2019s harder to steal.\n\nHe says people sometimes stop in to share stories about proposing to spouses or going on first dates at the Starlite.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Bozeman Daily Chronicle, http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A landmark sign from Bozeman's old Starlite drive-In theater has been returned to its owner after it was stolen last month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
