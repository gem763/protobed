In other words, on their initial rally, there was a preponderance of buyers willing to sell at higher prices. This time around, there are many investors that are underwater in the issue and hoping to just break even or eke out a small gain.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, investors will want to put emphasis on each issue's recent low as a possible exit point if a rally does not materialize.\n\nFriday\u2019s high and closing price in each issue may be a good indicator to follow next week if looking for a continuation rally.\n\nFinally, investments in the sector should be treated as extremely speculative, and investors should be comfortable with the worst-case scenario as opposed to an avenue to getting rich quickly.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAurora Cannabis Sells Remaining Green Organic Dutchman Shares For .5M\n\nTilray Is Down 55% In 2019: What Do The Fundamentals Say?\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
