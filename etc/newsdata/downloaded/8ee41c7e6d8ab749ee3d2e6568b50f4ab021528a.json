Cory Booker (N.J.) said. \u201cWe have seen it in the \u201916 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) \u2014 who last week bought a Facebook ad claiming, in jest, that the platform had endorsed President Trump \u2014 reiterated her call Tuesday to break up what she called \u201cmonopolists\u201d in Silicon Valley and pressed her rivals in Tuesday\u2019s debate to forgo donations from \u201cthe big tech executives.\u201d Even former tech executive Andrew Yang expressed a desire to find \u201cthe best way we can fight back against big tech companies.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe unanimity of criticism of Big Tech marked a sharp turnabout from 2008, when a then-young social media platform, Facebook, was skillfully deployed to help elect Barack Obama president. Those warm feelings are long past, damaged by Facebook\u2019s role in spreading disinformation against Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign and its refusal to act more aggressively against viral falsehoods in this election season.\n\nThe growing frustration with Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers threatens to put the industry in the crosshairs of a future Democratic White House should the party prevail in 2020. Warren\u2019s call for the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon has generated backlash within the industry, most visibly when Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees in July that he would \u201cgo to the mat ... and fight\u201d such an effort in court.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFacebook was a company that was incredibly popular among the public writ large, and particularly liberals, prior to 2016. It now ranks with tobacco companies, oil companies and the NRA in driving Democratic anger,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under Obama, whose use of Facebook in the 2008 campaign gave early hints of its power as a political organizing tool.\n\nAD\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the growing Democratic disaffection with Silicon Valley.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 animosity has only grown in response to Zuckerberg\u2019s recent courtship of conservatives, including dinners and other private meetings with right-leaning pundits and lawmakers \u2014 all at a time when some of Facebook\u2019s most visible leaders in Washington are conservatives, too.\n\nAD\n\nKatie Harbath, a former Republican strategist, including for Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, is the company\u2019s public policy director for global elections. Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy is Joel Kaplan, a veteran of the George W. Bush White House who, last year, sat two rows behind Brett M. Kavanaugh as he denied allegations of sexual misconduct before Congress and battled successfully for a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nAD\n\nOver the past few months, Zuckerberg has huddled with prominent conservatives, including Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), who oversees tech issues as chairman of his chamber\u2019s Judiciary Committee. The dinners, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak about the private conversations, marked Facebook\u2019s latest efforts to try to shore up support with influential political figures on the right who at times have criticized Silicon Valley for targeting Republicans unfairly.\n\nBut the meetings, first reported by Politico, sparked immediate Democratic outrage, including a campaign on Twitter to get users to quit Facebook, under the hashtag #deletefacebook. The report also drew a rare, testy response from Zuckerberg himself, who posted on his Facebook profile that he has dinners with officials on all sides of the political spectrum. \u201cMeeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t tried it, I suggest you do!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPolls this year have found that large swaths of the American public are skeptical of leading technology companies. A Fox News poll in June asking whether Facebook had \u201ctoo much power\u201d found agreement from roughly three out of five Americans, with little variation based on race, income level, age, gender, region or party affiliation.\n\nAD\n\nDistaste for major technology companies among conservatives has been obvious for years, with many Republicans \u2014 and especially Trump \u2014 bashing the industry for unproven allegations of liberal bias in moderating their platforms. They began voicing this critique forcefully ahead of the 2016 vote, leading to a summit in which top executives hosted prominent conservatives at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\n\nFor Democrats, though, the shift in opinion followed the 2016 election, when Russian operatives used the platform and other social media to spread viral falsehoods, exposing major weaknesses at Facebook that domestic and foreign sources continue to exploit to this day.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think that these companies have accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish, and that is a bipartisan, bad mood, with the word \u2018antitrust\u2019 being thrown around,\u201d said Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley.\n\nAD\n\nJust how deeply major technology companies have fallen out of favor with Democrats was evident Tuesday as 12 of the party\u2019s presidential aspirants took the stage outside of Columbus, Ohio. That a section of the three-hour dialogue was devoted to technology was on its own a sign of the shifting views of a party that once used Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube video service to elevate the country\u2019s \u201cfirst social-media president,\u201d as Obama was known.\n\nEric Schmidt, a top Google executive, was a visible supporter of Obama, and the company\u2019s alumni filled key roles in his White House. The industry also was a major source of money for Democrats. Donors in the communications and electronics sectors overwhelmingly backed Clinton in 2016, contributing roughly $62 million to her campaign and outside groups compared to roughly $7 million for Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAD\n\nDuring a town hall at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in the spring of 2011, Obama extolled Facebook for fostering \"dialogue,\" creating the conditions for a \"healthy democracy.\" The Obama-era optimism about social media was reflected globally, with so-called \u201cFacebook revolutions\u201d unfolding from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, from Tehran to Bucharest to Lower Manhattan.\n\nAD\n\nNo longer do Democrats cast Internet dwellers as engaged, enlightened citizens, however. Rather, in the words of Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman and current presidential candidate, they represent the \u201cproduct\u201d for social media platforms, which \u201cabuse that public trust ... at extraordinary profits.\u201d\n\nFor Sen. Kamala Harris of California, the problem stems from the current occupant of the Oval Office, who commands a massive online following, with more than 65 million users tracking the president\u2019s comments \u2014 many of them attacks on real and perceived rivals \u2014 on Twitter. Harris has asked Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account for violations of its policies against harassment and hateful conduct. The platform has declined to do so, but on Tuesday clarified the rare instances in which it would take action against world leaders.\n\nAD\n\nTwitter also joined Facebook and Google in refusing a request by the campaign of Joseph Biden, the former vice president, to stop airing an advertisement that made false claims about him and his son\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nThat refusal \u2014 in contrast to CNN\u2019s decision not to air the ad, and Comcast Corp.\u2019s NBCUniversal\u2019s move to stop airing it \u2014 has enraged Democrats and fueled calls for more regulation of campaign speech, putting the party starkly at odds with most of Silicon Valley. Facebook officials explicitly exempt the ads and other \u201cdirect speech\u201d by politicians from their system of fact checking, the creation of which was a key reform after Russians and others flooded Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram and other social media platforms with disinformation in 2016.\n\nWarren\u2019s call on Democrats to forego fundraising in Silicon Valley has not yet caught on. The San Francisco Bay Area has been a frequent fundraising stop for Harris as well as for Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom remained quiet during the exchange during the debate on the power of Silicon Valley.\n\nAD\n\nEven the candidates that don\u2019t take contributions from Silicon Valley have still poured money into the companies based there, in the form of digital advertising. The Democratic presidential contenders have spent roughly $5 million on Facebook ads alone so far this year, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy.\n\nAD\n\nThe action on the debate stage echoed complaints heard on Capitol Hill, where Democrats say Facebook, Google and other leading companies should be doing more \u2014 not just about disinformation but a range of other issues as well.", "description": "The Democratic Party\u2019s rapidly fading love affair with Big Tech has broken into open acrimony in recent weeks, punctuated by a presidential debate Tuesday in which leading candidates took turns decrying the industry\u2019s impact on the nation and workshopping ways to rein it in.", "authors": ["Craig Timberg", "National Reporter Covering Technology", "Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KLjzkgg1qsI7E6UA53N6mHdoQ34=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A7HNO7XFSBGZZPCWJJAFI54YKQ", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
