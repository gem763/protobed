(AP) \u2014 The Latest from ACC men's basketball media day on Tuesday (all times local):\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference Commissioner John Swofford says he is \"open minded\" when it comes to college athletes being paid for endorsement deals.\n\nLast month California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law that goes into effect in 2023 allowing athletes at universities in his state make money from their images, names or likenesses. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid.\n\nSwofford says that California law is \"extreme,\" but added that he is not opposed to \"modernizing\" rules for amateur athletics. However, he says he would prefer a consistent national approach rather than individual states laws that can vary.\n\nSwofford says, \"I don't think this is going to be the end of college athletics by any means. We've been resilient in the past and we will be now and we will be in the future.\"\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference will open the season trying to replace a significant amount of star power.\n\nThe league holds its preseason men's basketball media day on Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina. The ACC is coming off its third national championship in five years with Virginia winning that program's first title.\n\nYet the league must replace several big names, including national player of the year Zion Williamson from Duke, the headliner among the league's 10 NBA first-round draft picks in June.\n\nLouisville's Jordan Nwora and Notre Dame's John Mooney are the only returning all-ACC players.\n\nTuesday's schedule includes a full day of interviews for players and coaches, which includes Virginia Tech's Mike Young as the lone new coach.\n\nThe ACC will release media picks for preseason favorite and all-conference players Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
