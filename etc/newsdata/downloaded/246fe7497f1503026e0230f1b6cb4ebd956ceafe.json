Leicester is a very good team with a lot of unbelievable players.\n\n\u201cAfter winning the Premier League they rebuild their squad and are doing fantastic with a great manager like Brendan Rodgers, who I know very well. They are doing a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nThe Spurs boss will hope his team can start strongly on Saturday after a sluggish opening 45 at Olympiacos on Wednesday.\n\nPochettino\u2019s men had to settle for a point after a 2-2 draw in the Champions League Group B opener with Christian Eriksen\u2019s display criticised.\n\nBut his manager said: \u201cI am happy with the performance. Maybe (Wednesday) wasn\u2019t his best game, like the team.\n\n\u201cThe collective performance wasn\u2019t the best from us. I am happy with the commitment of Christian, he ran a lot and was very committed with the team, the effort but I think I am not concerned about him.\u201d\n\nDele Alli made his first start of the season in Athens and just his second appearance this term after a hamstring injury, but Pochettino called for patience with the England international.\n\nHe concluded: \u201cDele is a different situation from Christian. He got injured from the beginning of the season.\n\n\u201cI think it was his first start. He needs time to recover his best feeling. I am happy with him too, his performance, effort, only he needs time.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino feels it is too early to talk about contenders in the Premier League with the new campaign only five games old.
