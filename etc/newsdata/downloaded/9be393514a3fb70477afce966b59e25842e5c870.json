The strike has been launched and participation will be massive,\" Frederic Ruiz, who heads the CFE-CGC union at the RATP Paris public transport company, told Reuters.\n\nThe government did not waver in the face of rolling strikes last year over a reform of the state rail company, but Macron has since been weakened politically by a series of anti-government protests at the end of 2018 and early this year.\n\nThose protests, which shocked the nation with some of the worst street violence in decades, were triggered by concerns over falling living standards and also concerns Macron was pushing his reform agenda too hard.\n\nWhile promising to be open to external input on the pension reform, Philippe said that he is determined to carry out the pension reform plan.\n\nThe pension regime specific to RATP workers allows train drivers and other staff that work underground to retire at 52, a decade earlier than the normal legal retirement age for a full public pension.\n\nPrevious reforms have already rolled back some of RATP workers rights and increased how long they have to pay into the system, but workers are worried they will have to make further sacrifices.\n\nAn Odoxa-Dentsu poll found that nearly three out of four people surveyed did not think that Macron's government would come up with a good reform.\n\nPensions graphic link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/FRANCE-REFORM-PENSIONS/0H001QETZ87M/index.html", "description": "Paris commuters hit by transport strike over pension overhaul", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF8C0F5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
