Some people use them religiously, some ignore them. What should you do as a good citizen of the gym? What must you do to not be a gross person? Here are some rules of thumb.\n\nWhat you should always wipe\n\nAnything you have left a visible sweat stain on\n\nYoga mats that will be shared with another person\n\nBenches and the seats and headrests of machines, whenever possible\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll run off to get a wipe and return to find somebody on the bench or machine you were about to wipe. Either they didn\u2019t notice your sweat puddle, or they don\u2019t care. Let it go, and hang on to that wipe for the next thing you\u2019re going to drip on.\n\nWhat you don\u2019t usually need to wipe\n\nAnything you have covered with a towel (for example, if you lay a towel down on a bench before you use it)\n\nAnything that belongs to you and only you (your sweaty yoga mat, your problem)\n\nThe floor, unless you have created a slippery or dangerous situation\n\nRead the room\n\nGyms have different standards of cleanliness from each other, just as some houses are inhabited by neat freaks and some are, let\u2019s say, not. At some gyms, nobody wipes anything.\n\nIf your gym has rags and bottles of spray cleaner in prominent locations, canisters of wipes right by your equipment, signs asking people to please wipe things after using? Wipe that shit. If a sign in a gym asks you to do something, just do it. That\u2019s a good rule for life, ok?\n\nA little people-watching will clear up some of the ambiguities of the wiping policy. Should you wipe the handles of the treadmill when you\u2019re done using it? I think it\u2019s silly (what, you think I carry a towel around everywhere to wipe doorknobs?) but if everybody else does, I will.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to sit where somebody may have butt-printed, wipe the bench before you sit on it.\n\nThe power of the wipe rests with you\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the opposite situation, one that came up when I was looking for jerk moves in the gym. I got a lot of complaints about people who sweat everywhere and wipe up none of it.\n\nI think it\u2019s time for a different approach. Trying to correct the other guy\u2019s behaviour has not been working out for you. The gym employees have more things to worry about than whether this person didn\u2019t wipe that machine. Especially when, as you estimated, 60 per cent of the people there didn\u2019t wipe anything. I\u2019d leave gym staff out of this, and not individually confront people either.\n\nFortunately, you have a perfect solution right there in that wipe canister you\u2019re so familiar with. If you don\u2019t want to sit where somebody may have butt-printed, wipe the bench before you sit on it. That\u2019s the power of the wipe: you can use it to clean things for your own use, as well as to leave your station smelling fresh for the next person. Go ahead, treat yourself.", "description": "At most gyms there are little dispensers of wipes scattered throughout, or maybe rags and spray bottles so you can clean up after yourself.
