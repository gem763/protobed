According to Yahoo Finance analysis of donations made in 2019, Sanders is the most popular candidate among employees of the FAANG companies \u2013 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google \u2013 and Microsoft. Not far behind him is Sen. Warren, who, based on the number of donations made, is the second favorite.\n\nYahoo Finance analyzed Federal Election Commission data, specifically donations of employees from the FAANG companies and Microsoft, noting how many donations employees made to Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker, as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Yahoo Finance also examined donations to the presumptive Republican nominee, President Donald Trump.\n\nOut of 4,418 donations made to all 8 candidates, just under a third went to Sanders, while just over 20% went to Warren.\n\nSen. Cory Booker fared the worst among the candidates, only netting 1.4% of all the donations made by FAANG and Microsoft employees. Biden didn\u2019t fare much better, pulling in only 1.72% of all donations made this year from those employees.\n\nWho the employees of the FAANG companies and Microsoft are donating to the most often. More\n\nOf the six companies surveyed, Google employees made the most donations, with over 1,500 contributions given to the 8 candidates analyzed. (It's worth noting that Google, with around 100,000 employees, is only larger in size than Facebook and Netflix; Amazon has more than 600,000 employees.) Sanders scored roughly a third of all donations from Google employees with Warren pulling in more than a quarter. Biden did the worst, pulling in less than 1% of total donations from Google workers. Only 12 contributions were given to the Biden camp.\n\nWarren is well-known for proposing to break up big technology companies \u2013 including Facebook, Google and Amazon \u2013 and has said the tech behemoths have hampered innovation and competition. Other Democratic candidates have expressed support for reining in corporate consolidation, but haven\u2019t come out as hard against what Warren deems to be monopolies.\n\nRunning low on cash\n\nBoth Biden and Booker have been struggling with their fundraising totals of late, with Booker\u2019s camp pleading for donations or face ending his race. Booker ended up posting his best quarter in Q3, raking in $6 million. Biden fared much better than Booker in Q3, pulling in over $15 million. But concerns abound for the former VP. He only has $9 million cash on hand, far lower than his Democratic rivals Sanders and Warren.\n\nDespite blowing away Democrats with his fundraising total in the third quarter, Trump isn\u2019t faring as well among employees of FAANG companies. The president only received 7.5% of all donations contributed by FAANG and Microsoft (MSFT) employees. But despite Trump\u2019s frequent criticism of Amazon (AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, he was the third most popular candidate based on number of donations from Amazon employees. Nearly 14% of all donations went to the Trump camp.", "description": "Yahoo Finance analyzes donations made by FAANG and Microsoft employees to top Democratic candidates.", "authors": ["Kristin Myers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gxrZ8U2Pkmz4uxzYrtsqgw--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3482f8e0-fa7f-11e9-aef5-3a135f22fa67", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
