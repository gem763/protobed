Adamson was part of the West Point Grey Academy community where Trudeau, then 29, worked at the time, the magazine said. The picture was in the Vancouver private school\u2019s yearbook.\n\n\u201cI dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put make-up on. I shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d a grim-faced Trudeau said in comments carried live on Canadian television.\n\nThe picture shows him wearing a turban and a white robe, with his face covered in dark makeup.\n\n\u201cThis picture runs completely contrary to the image of tolerance the prime minister has so scrupulously cultivated. It can\u2019t be good for him or his party,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, chief executive officer of polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs.\n\nCanada has an official policy of multiculturalism and about one in five Canadians were born overseas, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nNECK-AND-NECK\n\nDonning dark make-up is particularly sensitive in the United States, given its long history of slavery. In February, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam resisted calls to step down over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologizes for wearing brownface makeup in 2001, to reporters on the Liberal party leader\u00d5s election campaign jet in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in a still image from video September 18, 2019. CBC via REUTERS.\n\nTrudeau, questioned by reporters, also admitted he had dressed up in make-up when at high school and performed \u201cDay O\u201d, a traditional Jamaican song about people loading bananas onto boats.\n\nTrudeau is locked in a neck-and-neck battle with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer ahead of the Oct. 21 federal election.\n\nScheer said he was \u201cextremely shocked and disappointed\u201d by the photo.\n\n\u201cWearing brown face is an act of open mockery and racism. What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who\u2019s not fit to govern this country,\u201d he told reporters in Quebec.\n\nTrudeau has seen his once sky-high popularity hurt by a series of missteps, including a ruling last month by a top watchdog that he had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm avoid a corruption trial.\n\nTrudeau brushed off suggestions he might quit.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cI am going to be asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did ... it was a dumb thing to do. I\u2019m disappointed in myself. I\u2019m pissed off with myself for having done it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ruling Liberals are competing for left-of-centre votes with the New Democrats of Jagmeet Singh, a practising Sikh, who is the first person from ethnic minority descent to lead a major party in Canada.\n\n\u201cThe people who see this image are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are,\u201d a visibly upset Singh told reporters.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologised on Wednesday for wearing brown face make-up in 2001 after an embarrassing picture emerged less than five weeks before an election in which he faces a tough fight.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431452925&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I06F", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
