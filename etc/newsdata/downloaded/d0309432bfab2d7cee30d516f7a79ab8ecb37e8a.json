The impeachment clause of the Constitution describes three major assaults on the state as reasons for Congress to remove a president: \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nIn terms of Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, there is little need to engage in a debate over what constitutes \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Instead, they clearly fit the definition of bribery.\n\n\u201c[B]ribery may mean the taking as well as the giving of a bribe,\u201d Charles Black, the late law professor, wrote in \u201cImpeachment: A Handbook,\u201d the definitive legal interpretation of impeachment for the past 45 years.\n\nIn this case, Trump appears to have used the power of his office to extort a foreign country (Ukraine) by twisting the good relations between the two and the military aid provided by the U.S. \u2014 things the Ukrainian government is dependent upon \u2014 into a bribe in exchange for a personal favor for Trump going into the 2020 election.\n\nThat the actions of Trump and his consigliere, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, were an attempt to extort the Ukrainian government is clear from the whistleblower complaint and the summary of Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 25, 2019.

For months, Giuliani made it clear in public statements that Zelensky\u2019s administration must open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and the 2016 Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers:\n\nIn May, Giuliani canceled a planned trip to Ukraine \u2014 because, he claimed, Zelensky was \u201csurrounded by enemies of the president ... and of the United States.\u201d\n\nZelensky had requested that Vice President Mike Pence attend his inauguration in Ukraine on May 20 but \u201con or around\u201d May 14, according to the whistleblower, \u201cthe President instructed Vice President Pence to cancel his planned travel.\u201d Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the U.S. delegation to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration instead of Pence.\n\nAround the time of Pence\u2019s canceled trip, it was \u201cmade clear\u201d to the officials who informed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201cthat the President did not want to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy until he saw how Zelenskyy \u2018chose to act\u2019 in office.\u201d (The complaint uses a different transliteration of Zelensky.)\n\nAlso in the middle of May, the whistleblower was informed by \u201cmultiple U.S. officials\u201d that \u201cUkrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to \u2018play ball\u2019 on the issues\u201d raised publicly by Giuliani (that is, opening investigations to help Trump\u2019s reelection).\n\nThroughout June, Giuliani continued to insist that Zelensky open investigations into Biden and the circumstances of the Russian hacking of the DNC in 2016.\n\n\u201cNew Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of Ukrainian interference in 2016 and alleged Biden bribery of Poroshenko,\u201d Giuliani tweeted on June 21. \u201cTime for leadership to investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused by Hillary and Clinton people.\u201d\n\nThen, in early July, Trump ordered all government agencies \u201cto suspend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine,\u201d according to the whistleblower complaint. The Office of Management and Budget sent out its first message to other agencies on July 18 saying that Trump had ordered the suspension of aid \u201cearlier that month.\u201d A second message reiterating this message was sent to agencies on July 23.\n\nThis precipitated the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky. On the call, Trump told Zelensky that the only country Ukraine could count on for support is the United States, according to the call summary. However, Trump added that the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine had not been \u201creciprocal.\u201d Zelensky thanked Trump for U.S. support and said he hoped to purchase more military equipment from the U.S. soon.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though,\u201d Trump replied, before explaining that Zelensky should launch investigations into Biden and the hacking of the DNC\u2019s server in 2016. The word \u201cthough\u201d clearly ties the \u201cfavor\u201d to Zelensky\u2019s immediately preceding praise for U.S. military support.\n\nThe next day, on July 26, OMB sent a third message to agencies reminding them of Trump\u2019s suspension of all U.S. support for Ukraine. No policy rationale was provided, according to the complaint. At the same time, White House lawyers moved the transcript of the call to a classified server.\n\nAlthough there are gaps in the timeline of Trump and Giuliani\u2019s actions that will be filled by Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry, what is known shows that Zelensky and his administration felt that they had to open the investigations Trump hoped would help his reelection campaign in order for Ukraine to remain in the good graces of the United States of America.\n\nTrump walks off after speaking with reporters after arriving at Andrews Air Force Base on September 26, 2019.
