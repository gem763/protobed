We are committed to ensuring we create welcoming and inclusive environments for students of all genders, backgrounds and ethnicities to flourish and this research shows significant progress towards that.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ending harassment and hate crime for good in higher education.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cWhile it is understandable that there has been a particular focus on addressing gender-based violence, it is time for us to step-up and make sure the same priority status and resourcing is given to addressing all forms of harassment and hate.\u201d\n\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, the higher education regulator, said that \u201cmore must be done\u201d to address harassment, assault or discrimination facing students.\n\n\u201cThese improvements need to be taking place across all universities,\u201d she added.\n\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: \u2018Universities should be safe spaces for all staff and students, free from harassment and discrimination, but this report shows there is still much work to be done to make this a reality. The minister is right to call for a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of harassment and hate crime, but he must be ready to back this up with sanctions where the sector fails to act.\"\n\nOmar Khan, director of the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, said: \u201cStatements of zero tolerance policies towards racism while welcome, are not enough. They depend on disclosure and the effectiveness, transparency and credibility of mechanisms for reporting and dealing with complaints of racism.\"", "description": "Universities must do more to tackle racial harassment and hate crime on campus, according to a new report.
