Joe Crowley, who was elected to the Assembly from Queens in 1986, look like an amateur. | AP Photo Lentol gets first primary challenge in a decade\n\nALBANY \u2014 Activist and community board member Emily Gallagher will launch a campaign against Assemblyman Joe Lentol on Monday, giving the Brooklyn Democrat his first primary challenge in a decade.\n\n\u201cNorth Brooklyn deserves a choice of who we\u2019re sending to Albany and who we are having at the front lines of the conversation,\" said Gallagher, who previously worked as co-chair of a community organization called Neighbors Allied for Good Growth.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI intimately know the struggle of so many in north Brooklyn because I\u2019ve lived it,\u201d said Gallagher, pointing to experiences like working in the gig economy and struggling to make rent. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take on these fights because they\u2019re really personal.\u201d\n\nGallagher identifies herself as a progressive who\u2019s planning a grassroots campaign. Candidates matching that description have outperformed expectations in several elections in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the most progressive communities in the country,\" she said. \"We\u2019re on the front lines of this struggle for a fair and inclusive city, and there hasn\u2019t been a competitive election here in more than a decade.\u201d\n\nUnlike most of the state legislators who were defeated in last year\u2019s primaries, Lentol\u2019s Democratic bona fides have never been questioned. As the longtime chairman of the powerful Codes Committee, he\u2019s often praised by liberal lawmakers for his work on issues like raising the age of criminal responsibility.\n\nEver since the left began to make noise about challenging Assembly Democrats, however, Lentol\u2019s name has repeatedly surfaced as a possible target, in part because of his support of Airbnb and the willingness of the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, which he co-chairs, to accept real estate money. But at least one group that has played a major role in recent challenges from the left may sit out the contest.\n\nThe Brooklyn arm of the Democratic Socialists of America has been interested in mounting a primary challenge against Lentol and interviewed Gallagher and Nadja Oertelt, a DSA member, for potential endorsements, Megan Magray, coordinator for NYC-DSA\u2019s Brooklyn electoral communications committee, said in a text message.\n\nBut in a recent meeting, the Brooklyn DSA electoral working group declined to recommend either Gallagher or Oertelt for endorsement, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported. The electoral working group did recommend candidates for four other primary challenges throughout the borough. (Two more votes must take place before any candidates are officially endorsed.)\n\nA source in the Brooklyn DSA said there were concerns among some members that both Gallagher and Oertelt may not reflect socialist values enough to generate grassroots enthusiasm for their campaigns. The organization is also weighing how much capacity it has to support local elections.\n\nDespite the apparent setback for Gallagher and Oertelt, the Brooklyn DSA is leaving the door open for a primary challenge against Lentol.\n\n\u201cCandidates are still moving through the endorsement process, and we\u2019re leaving open the possibility of endorsing a candidate in Lentol\u2019s district,\u201d Magray said.\n\nThe incumbent, for his part, expressed confidence, but acknowledged he might be in for more of a fight than in past elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell,\u201d Lentol said when asked if next year might be more challenging than his past contests. \u201cThere have been a lot of changes in the district, so I expect it\u2019ll be harder than it has in the past. \u2026 But if you do your job like I do, I\u2019ve gotten around as well as anybody in their business to serve my constituents. It could be a problem with people who don\u2019t know me, but that remains to be seen.\"\n\nAs a political institution, Lentol makes former Rep. Joe Crowley, who was elected to the Assembly from Queens in 1986, look like an amateur. Three generations of Lenti have represented Brooklyn in the Assembly, with his grandfather and namesake winning office down-ballot from Al Smith in 1918. The incumbent was elected in 1972, making him the third-longest-serving state legislator in New York\u2019s history.\n\nThe incumbent has handily brushed off challengers in the past. He last had a primary in 2010, when he won with 81 percent of the vote \u2014 and that was a squeaker compared to the past few general election results in the deep-blue district.\n\nGallagher's decision to launch a campaign so early in the cycle represents a break from the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had really a long lineage of the same leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s really too much at stake right now to put our democracy on autopilot.\u201d", "description": "Emily Gallagher identifies herself as a progressive who\u2019s planning a grassroots campaign.", "authors": ["Bill Mahoney", "Danielle Muoio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/13/e9/decc29fc4d99b1ae3bc553e2f7ab/joe-lentol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
