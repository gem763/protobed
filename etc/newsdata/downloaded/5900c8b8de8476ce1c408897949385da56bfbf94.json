The cell known as \u201cLos Pelones\u201d is believed responsible for much of the violence in the tourist region.\n\nJonathan \u201cEl Pantera\u201d was captured in Canc\u00fan by Quintana Roo state police during a security operation. El Pantera is the designated plaza boss of Los Pelones, which operates in nearby Playa del Carmen. The state attorney general reported the man was wanted for attempted murder.

In June, two gunmen were killed in Canc\u00fan after they ambushed a prison transportation convoy. The attack was repelled by authorities. Initial reports indicated the ambush was an attempt to free a jailed leader of Los Pelones. Further investigation revealed the incident was an assassination attempt on a prisoner identified as Ra\u00fal Mu\u00f1oz Aguirre aka \u201cEl Sinclair.\u201d\n\nEl Sinclair survived a separate assassination attempt in June when a team of approximately eight gunmen dressed in cloned Federal Police uniforms and tactical gear attempted to either kidnap or execute him. The gunmen were met with gunfire from bodyguards loyal to El Sinclair. During the shootout, a gunman was fatally wounded and left behind. El Sinclair was injured in the upper thigh and transported to a hospital under heavy security.\n\nRobert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs.
