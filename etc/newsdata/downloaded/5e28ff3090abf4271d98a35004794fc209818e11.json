Analysts in a Bloomberg survey on average see an expansion of 1.5%, with none expecting growth to exceed 1.9%, which is also the International Monetary Fund\u2019s forecast as of July.\n\nThe plan calls for a primary surplus, which excludes debt interest payments, that\u2019s equivalent to 0.7% of gross domestic product, compared with the 1% expected for 2019.\n\n\u201cOverall, a relatively fair budget, but the assumptions on growth and oil production are definitely on the optimistic side,\u201d said Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \u201cThe key question for investors and markets will be whether the administration is ultimately strongly committed to deliver the 0.7% of GDP primary fiscal target or not.\u201d\n\nThe plan foresees oil output of 1.951 million barrels per day, implying an increase of about 18% from recent levels. After years of declines, state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, stabilized its production at 1.66 million barrels a day in the second quarter.\n\nInvestors have been awaiting the 2020 budget proposal from AMLO, as the leftist is known, to see if there would be any signs of fiscal slippage after the economy stagnated in the first half. His government only had two weeks to prepare the 2019 budget after taking office in December, meaning next year\u2019s plan was drafted with much more preparation time.\n\nHerrera and other officials had promised in recent days that the 2020 plan would be fiscally responsible and reassuring to investors even as the government seeks to boost social spending and helped Pemex.\n\n(Adds context in the last two paragraphs.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Eric Martin in Mexico City at emartin21@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Carlos Manuel Rodriguez at carlosmr@bloomberg.net, Linus Chua, Steve Geimann\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sent Congress a 2020 budget plan on Sunday that assumes a growth scenario many economists see as too optimistic.Mexico\u2019s economy will expand 1.5% to 2.5% in 2020, according to the proposal submitted by Finance Minister Arturo Herrera.
