(Jef Rabillon/The Kennedy Center)\n\nDance critic\n\nThe revolutionary art of Merce Cunningham, the great modern-dance choreographer, looks as singular and even futuristic now, in his centennial year, as it must have 50 and 60 years ago.\n\nThis was clear Thursday night at the Kennedy Center, where the Compagnie Centre National de Danse Contemporaine, from Angers, France, performed his meditative \u201cBeach Birds\u201d and the more lush \u201cBIPED,\u201d with its shimmering costumes, arresting visual projections and a layered, tuneful score by Gavin Bryars.\n\nBryars, the celebrated experimental composer who worked with Cunningham\u2019s longtime musical collaborator, John Cage, in the 1960s, was in the pit playing upright bass for both pieces Thursday. Lucky for us, to be so close to the Cunningham-Cage royalty.\n\nThe artistic bloodline is important, given Cunningham\u2019s death in 2009. He would have been 100 on April 16, and this program, which continues through Saturday, is part of the \u201cMerce Cunningham at 100\u201d celebrations across the country, as well as in Europe, Latin America and Canada.\n\nThe CNDC, as the French company is called, offered a rare look at two Cunningham pieces from the 1990s. Both \u201cBeach Birds\u201d and \u201cBIPED\u201d were lovingly reconstructed and staged by Robert Swinston, the CNDC director who was a longtime member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company.\n\nBut hands-on connection to a dance isn\u2019t enough to bring it to life. The works looked beautiful, but after getting underway, they felt somewhat lackluster. \u201cBeach Birds\u201d takes your breath away when it begins, with the dancers silhouetted in silence on a darkened stage, each one with knees slightly bent. They look like an array of Noguchi sculptures, stylized and sleek. They\u2019re even more beautiful when the lights come up, and they haven\u2019t moved. They still have that look of perching, and they\u2019re swaying so gently, it\u2019s almost imperceptible. When Cage\u2019s music begins, it sounds like wind and soft rain.\n\n\n\nDancers Anna Chirescu and Carlo Schiavo perform in \u201cBeach Birds\u201d at \u201cMerce Cunningham at 100.\u201d (Charlotte Audureau/The Kennedy Center)\n\nThe dancers look like birds, all in white except for a black stripe across the chest and arms. Delicately, they hop and dip. They extend a foreleg or raise a knee; they balance for long periods. It\u2019s a lovely catalogue of what made Cunningham such a revolutionary. His discovery was quite simple, really: He was fascinated with the bones and muscles of the body, and with their still, sculptural possibilities as much as their range of motion and actions. This led him to a radical rethinking of dance, as pure form. This is what\u2019s going on in \u201cBeach Birds.\u201d\n\nHowever birdlike the dancers seem, Cunningham isn\u2019t telling a story about birds or beaches. His dances exist entirely on their own, without plot or characters, without emotionalism or psychology. Without message.\n\nHis work was in step with the contemporary-art world of the mid-20th century \u2014 with so many abstract painters, sculptors and musicians \u2014 but it radically swings away from most other dance. At times slow and repetitive, Cunningham\u2019s pieces aren\u2019t always easy to stick with.\n\nIt\u2019s exceptionally difficult to keep a master\u2019s work going without the master there, especially in Cunningham\u2019s work, which isn\u2019t tied to musical counts and which relies on the often-unusual shapes and body mechanics of his own invention. At the Kennedy Center there were a few miscues among the dancers, a few moments when uniformity was missing or positions were shaky. As stripped-down as it seems, Cunningham\u2019s choreography is extraordinarily demanding on the body and the memory.\n\n\u201cBIPED\u201d fared a bit better, largely because it is more energized and visually rich. The dancers are sleekly clad in iridescent silver. They leap and twist behind a scrim, and lines of bright color are projected around them, adding a strong, dynamic quality. At times, animated images loom over them, created from the computer software Cunningham sometimes used to develop his choreography. The scrim is a striking theatrical device, but also a metaphor: As marvelous as this dance looked in its decor and construction, and with Bryars\u2019s mesmerizing and mysterious sound world, watching it somehow felt like an imperfect glimpse at a world gone by.\n\nMerce Cunningham at 100 with Compagnie Centre National de Danse Contemporaine Through Saturday at the Kennedy Center. 202-467-4600. kennedy-center.org.\n\n", "description": "Compagnie Centre National de Danse Contemporaine performs \u201cBeach Birds\u201d and \u201cBIPED\u201d at the Kennedy Center.", "authors": ["Sarah L.
