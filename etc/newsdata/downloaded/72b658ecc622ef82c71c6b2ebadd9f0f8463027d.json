'It's been a tough year.'\n\nHosts Ben Shephard and Penny Lancaster asked whether he'd rethink his conduct after he said he kissed the woman in question to protect her from a passenger who called her 'fat and ugly'.\n\n'I don't think I'll ever change I am who I am,' he said. 'I've always been a nice guy, a caring guy and ill help anybody. I'm not saying I did right, I'm not saying I did wrong.'\n\nThe verdict last week prompted fury, with several women taking to social media to criticise the decision.\n\nElizabeth Pascoe wrote: 'If forcibly kissing a stranger on a train (it's funny bc she's fat) in front of a carriage worth of people isn't sexual assault, then how can anyone expect to be protected by the law?'\n\nHelen Mott added: 'To the woman who reported being forcibly kissed by Paul Gascoigne I want to say thank you for going through this, please believe it has made a difference, the system was not designed to give women justice but we take small steps. Many women strongly support you.'\n\nKathryn Williams posted: 'No wonder women don't report assault.A train full of people witnessed it. And him calling her a fat lass as defence why it wouldn't be sexual has my blood boiling. Let's hope the Botox on his face stops more speech.'\n\nBut, explaining the incident itself, Gazza said today: 'I was on the train and a couple of women wanted some selfies, some photos with them.\n\n'When I got up, someone next to us said, \"why do you want a photo with her she's fat and ugly?\"\n\n'So, I went and sat next to her and said, \"You are not fat and ugly, you are beautiful inside and out,\" I learnt that from treatment centres.\n\n'I just thought I would give her a bit of confidence. I never thought anything of it. Until I went to the hotel and then got the call, we want to question you.'\n\nOn whether he kissed her, he went on: 'I admit that, I said it straight away from when the police called. I gave her a peck and said she's not fat and ugly, she's beautiful inside and out.'\n\nAsked about kissing a stranger on the lips and whether it had been a wise decision, he added: 'Of course not, I look back at it now. If that was the case, I would be in court for the last 30 years for people coming up and kissing me.\n\n'So, I just never thought anything, I didn't feel it at a sexual way, or I didn't look at that way, you know? I sat with my lawyers and they told me what could happen.'", "description": "The 52-year-old former footballer appeared on Good Morning Britain today to reveal how he struggled to stay strong in the 12 months before he walked free from Teesside Crown Court.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/08/20072010-0-image-a-7_1571815068649.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
