It follows years of complaints from American and other diplomats about controls on their ability to move around China and to meet with officials and members of the public.\n\nAmbassador Terry Branstad said the rule is \u201cvery modest\u201d and intended to win more access for American diplomats in China\u2019s \u201cclosed system.\u201d He rejected Chinese criticism that the measure violates a global treaty on conditions for diplomats as \u201cvery outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe rule change comes amid a deteriorating U.S.-Chinese relationship and a tariff war over American complaints about Beijing\u2019s trade surplus and technology ambitions.\n\nChinese diplomats would be required to report contacts with American educators, researchers and local and state governments under the rule announced Wednesday. Branstad said by contrast, American diplomats face a more restrictive system that requires them to apply for permission for such contacts, which he said often is refused.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing has a \u201cpositive attitude\u201d toward cooperation with the United States and expressed hope Branstad could clarify what restrictions he was talking about.\n\n\u201cWe hope that on this issue, the United States will face facts and facilitate normal people-to-people exchanges between the two sides, instead of setting up obstacles, let alone making unfounded countercharges,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying.\n\nIn Australia, individuals and businesses that try to influence politics or the government for a foreign country have been required to register since December. That followed a government report that found China\u2019s Communist Party has tried over the past decade to influence Australian policy, compromise political parties and gain access to government.\n\nBranstad said American diplomats have been blocked from meeting with Chinese law enforcement and other officials and requests to visit universities have been refused. The ambassador said when he and other diplomats planned to visit a coffee shop in the western province of Qinghai during a trip to Tibet, officials visited the shop in advance and ordered employees and customers not to talk to the Americans.\n\n\u201cThe State Department finally came to the opinion that to try to improve our access we need to show some reciprocity,\u201d Branstad told reporters.\n\nThe ambassador said U.S. officials have yet to discuss the rule directly with Chinese authorities. But the Chinese Embassy complained on its Twitter account that the rule violates the Vienna Convention and said China imposes no similar restrictions on American diplomats \u2014 a claim that conflicts with Branstad\u2019s comments and complaints by diplomats from other countries about curbs on their activities.\n\n\u201cI think the response on Twitter from the Chinese ambassador has been really outrageous,\u201d said Branstad. \u201cThe truth is that we have a very open system and they have a very closed system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Branstad said Washington is considering a separate proposal to require employees of \u201cparty-controlled entities\u201d \u2014 a group that might include state media \u2014 to register as foreign agents. He said that is unrelated to the rule for diplomats.\n\n\u201cThere has been some discussion about Chinese that are working for party-controlled entities and whether they should be treated as foreign agents,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come down. But that\u2019s really a separate issue. It\u2019s not part of this.\u201d", "description": "The US rejected Chinese criticism that the measure violates a global treaty on conditions for diplomats as \u201cvery outrageous.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/01c30b8d-xi-jinping-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
