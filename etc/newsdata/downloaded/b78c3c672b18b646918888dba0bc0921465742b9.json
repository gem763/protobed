Talking Tech has you covered. USA TODAY\n\nIf you use Spotify only to search for a specific song or artist, you're really missing out.\n\nThe music streaming app has had some major updates lately, giving users long-requested features, smart recommendations and family mixes that combine the tracks you and your loved ones enjoy.\n\nThough it's not native to your smartphone the way Apple Music is, the downloadable app is just as flexible. So you can set it up in the car, on your smart home assistant and download tracks to listen to offline.\n\nSpotify works on iOS and Android smartphones and tablets as well on desktop computers.\n\nApple Music tops 60 million subscribers:But can it catch Spotify?\n\nApple Arcade: This is what will make the subscription service a winner\n\nA 2019 WSJ report said that Apple overtook the Swedish streaming giant as the most popular service in the U.S. Spotify has distinct offerings including a free ad-supported tier, extensive playlist selection and much-buzzed-about podcast discovery tools.\n\nStill, using the multiplatform app can be confusing whether you're paying the $9.99 monthly subscription fee or not.\n\nHere's how to make the most of it\n\nCreate your own podcast playlist: Spotify recently rolled out Audio First, which lets users combine music and podcasts into one playlist. You can start a playlist from scratch, or build on one of the platforms 3 billion user-generated playlists. Here's how to do it:\n\nSelect a podcast you're interested in. Tap the three horizontal dots on the right side of an episode. Tap \u201cAdd to playlist.\u201d Select a playlist you\u2019ve already created you like to add it to. Or, tap to create a new playlist from scratch.\n\nI have a Spotify Playlist simply entitled 'Guilty Pleasures', the most embarrassing track on which is 'Love Yourself' by Justin Bieber \ud83d\ude33 \u2014 Law Turley (@Treacle_A) October 11, 2019\n\nDownload music and podcasts for your commute: Sometimes being disconnected from cellular service or Wi-Fi is unavoidable, so the app gives you an option to download tracks for when you don't have access to online data. Here's how to do it:\n\nNavigate to the content you want to stream offline. Find the download toggle and switch it to ON. You'll know it's working when it turns green. Once the content in your library is downloaded, you\u2019ll see a green arrow beneath each song's name. If the track is grayed out when you\u2019re offline, it means you can't play it until you're connected to the internet again.\n\n'Your Daily Drive:' Spotify enables you to think less during your commute\n\nChoose from hundreds of pre-made playlists on Spotify or create your own. (Photo: Spotify)\n\nFind a playlist for your coffee break: Spotify created a couple of playlists just for your morning routine at home. The platform created Wake Up and Smell the Coffee, Soul Coffee, and Arabic Coffee to choose from. Or you can pick from more than 2 million fan-made \u201ccoffee,\u201d \u201clatte,\u201d \u201ccaffeine,\u201d \u201cespresso,\u201d \u201ccaf\u00e9,\u201d and \u201ckaffe\u201d playlists.\n\nJust type the keywords in the search bar and sift through the options.\n\n(Photo: Spotify)\n\nMarie Kondo your playlists: If your playlist creating habits become obsessive, there's a way to organize them so that they're easier to find. You need the desktop app to create a folder for them, which will show up on your mobile devices. Here's how to do it:\n\nRight-click a playlist in the menu on the left of the desktop app. Select Create Folder. Give it a name and press enter.\n\nTo add to the folder, select a playlist from the menu in the left of the desktop app. Then use drag and drop to add it to a playlist folder. You can also build folders within folders by right-clicking a playlist folder and selecting Create folder.\n\nFilter out the curse words: In August, Spotify added a tool that gives adults better control over the content children listen to. And in October, the platform released a blog post detailing how to \"filter out songs that might not be appropriate for everyone in your house or car to hear.\" Here's how to do it:\n\n(Photo: Spotify)\n\nOn the mobile app, tap the \u201cHome\u201d icon.
