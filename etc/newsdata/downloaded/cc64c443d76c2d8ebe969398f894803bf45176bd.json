Senior army generals and Mugabe\u2019s wife and children followed, as a brass band played.\n\nThe 60,000 seater stadium was only half-filled.\n\nIn a tribute to his predecessor, Mnangagwa said Mugabe stood in defence of Africans. He urged the West to remove sanctions that were imposed during Mugabe\u2019s rule.\n\n\u201cWe who remain shall continue to hear his rich, brave, defiant and inspiring voice ... encouraging and warning us to be vigilant and astute,\u201d Mnangagwa said in a speech.\n\n\u201cA giant tree of Africa has fallen. Today Africa weeps.\u201d\n\nMnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party wanted Mugabe buried at the national shrine to heroes of the 15-year liberation war against white minority rule. But some relatives, expressing bitterness at the way former comrades ousted Mugabe, had pushed for him to be buried in his home village.\n\nWalter Chidhakwa, who spoke on behalf of Mugabe\u2019s family, said Mugabe was an icon who was determined and unflinching in pursuing policies like land reform and later the black economic empowerment programme.\n\nMugabe left behind a country wrecked by hyperinflation, dollarisation and deeply entrenched corruption.\n\nFormer first lady of Zimbabwe, Grace Mugabe pays her last respects during a state funeral of her husband and Zimbabwe's longtime ruler Robert Mugabe, at the national sports stadium in Harare, Zimbabwe, September 14, 2019.

The attacks mainly targeted shops owned by African migrants.\n\nThe master of ceremony was forced to appeal to the crowd to give Ramaphosa a chance to speak.\n\n\u201cI stand before you as a fellow African to express my regret and to apologise for what has happened in our country,\u201d Ramaphosa said, to cheering from the crowd.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uhuru Kenyatta called Mugabe an intellectual giant, \u201ca visionary leader and a relentless champion of African dignity.\u201d\n\nOther heads of state who attended Saturday\u2019s funeral included long-ruling leaders from Equatorial Guinea and Congo while China, Russia and Cuba, which supported Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation movements that fought white minority rule, were represented by officials.\n\nProminent officials from Western countries, which were critical of Mugabe\u2019s rule, did not feature in the official funeral programme.\n\nMnangagwa led heads of state in viewing Mugabe\u2019s body, which was followed by a military 21-gun salute to honour Mugabe.\n\nBanners at the stadium where Mugabe\u2019s body lay in state read \u201cHamba kahle, Gushungo,\u201d (go well, Gushungo)\u201d, a reference to his clan name, and \u201cGo well our revolutionary icon\u201d.\n\nCleo Mapuranga, a caterer, told Reuters that Mugabe fought to give land and economic freedom to blacks and provided non-racial education.\n\n\u201cNow, people are suffering. No one is controlling the prices in the shops. Our finance minister is trying to implement first-world policies which don\u2019t work in third-world countries.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nMugabe\u2019s death has made some Zimbabweans question what Mnangagwa has achieved in his two years in power.\n\nHis government has taken steps to cut the budget deficit, remove subsidies on fuel and power and repeal laws curbing public and media freedoms, but those reforms and austerity measures have compounded ordinary people\u2019s hardships.", "description": "Zimbabwe's founder Robert Mugabe was honoured as an icon, principled leader and African intellectual giant at a state funeral on Saturday, after a week of disputes over his burial threatened to embarrass President Emmerson Mnangagwa.", "authors": ["Alexander Winning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429829916&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0JV", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
