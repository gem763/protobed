The then-22-year-old native of Taunton, Mass., took an excursion out West to party at a three-day music festival with friends in Las Vegas.\n\nAt that hour, Costa hadn\u2019t even gone to bed yet. After a wild night of partying in \u201cSin City,\u201d he was in no condition to receive the news Proctor was about to break.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just waking up at that time or going to bed depending on how you look at it,\u201d Costa said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Nothing, dude. I\u2019m in Vegas. I\u2019m having a good time.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ve got something to tell you.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, (expletive).\u2019\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Devin got into a car accident this morning.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018OK.\u2019 He got into a car accident. Whatever. He\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah. He\u2019s not going to make it.\u2019 Like, holy (expletive).\u201d\n\nDevin Carrier and his brother Logan had been driving home from practice when his car crashed into the woods. Logan walked away unscathed, but Devin was pronounced dead at the scene. The Carriers\u2019 father, a police officer, was one of the first responders.\n\nDue to Costa\u2019s state when he took the phone call after a night out, it took a while for the situation to really settle in. Eventually, it became increasingly real.\n\n\u201cIt was very weird thing,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to react because I\u2019m pretty (expletive) trashed, number one. Number two, this is my boy that\u2019s no longer with us that I can\u2019t be there for.\n\n\u201c\u2026 As time started going by, I was talking to my boys. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yo, Devin like actually really died. This isn\u2019t funny. This is real (expletive). He\u2019s actually no longer here.'\u201d\n\nEven inebriated, Costa knew the right thing to do. He had to head home. Twelve hours later, Costa caught a flight from Las Vegas to Massachusetts. Without sleeping, he made a quick stop at his house before he went straight to the Carriers\u2019.\n\nCosta joined Carrier\u2019s family and friends in mourning and reflected on the life of his best friend with those who knew him best. Carrier was known for \u201cball-busting\u201d Costa. Perhaps what happened next was one last joke at Costa\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cOf course it was really (expletive) sad, but there was some light,\u201d Costa said. \u201cWe talked a lot about Devin. We\u2019re (expletive) this and that. We\u2019re all sitting there crying. I just got back from Vegas and I\u2019m (expletive) trashed. I have a tattoo sticker on my neck that says \u2018Bad girl.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all crying and then all of sudden they\u2019re like, \u2018Randy, what the (expletive) is on your neck?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, just give me a (expletive) break.\u2019 This stupid sticker.\u201d\n\nCarrying out a legacy\n\nDuring fight week, Devin Carrier never leaves Randy Costa\u2019s side. The UFC bantamweight carries a picture of his fallen friend everywhere when gearing up for fight night.\n\nNot only in this life, but also since his death, Carrier has had a big impact on Costa.\n\nThe two met around 2010, when their girlfriends at the time were working together. When Costa heard his girlfriend knew a \u201cfighter,\u201d he was skeptical. \u201cEveryone has had a fight,\u201d Costa said.\n\nThrough the power of Facebook, Costa looked into Carrier\u2019s background. Much to his surprise, Carrier was legit.\n\n\u201cWe ended up forming a relationship over Facebook,\u201d Costa said. \u201cTalk and text and (expletive). Then he came to (Joe) Lauzon\u2019s (gym). That\u2019s when we really kicked it off.\u201d\n\nWhen talking about gym culture, Costa broke it down in layman\u2019s terms. \u201cFriends in the gym\u201d relationships aren\u2019t usually the same as \u201cfriends outside of the gym\u201d relationships. Costa didn\u2019t have many deep bonds with his gym friends, but Carrier was an exception. His gym buddy became his real life best friend.\n\n\u201cDevin and I, we were tight,\u201d Costa said. \u201cIt was more than just the gym stuff. Devin and I trained often, but it wasn\u2019t enough to form this friendship. Our friendship was much deeper than just the gym.\u201d\n\nEvery time Costa reminisces on Carrier, he lights up. Their friendship was comical, honest and caring. According to Costa, there was a lot of \u201cball-busting\u201d \u2013 a lot.\n\n\u201cWe were always just being idiots and dumbasses and (expletive) something up,\u201d Costa said. \u201cAlways talking (expletive) about someone. Just being idiots. I think that\u2019s why him and I were so tight. We were very alike in that regard.\n\n\u201c\u2026 We liked the same things. He (expletive) hated video games. I hated video games. We\u2019d be like, \u2018Everyone at Lauzon\u2019s is a bunch of nerds.\u2019 It was all this stuff we\u2019d always connect on so well. He was just an awesome dude.\u201d\n\nBall-busting aside, Costa can\u2019t forget Carrier\u2019s true character. Carrier befriended anyone and everyone and always treated those around him with respect.\n\n\u201cHe was just like, a real, real good dude,\u201d Costa said. \u201cHe was real. No (expletive). It was what it was. What you saw was what you got. He wasn\u2019t feeding (expletive). He was great to all of his peers and everyone around him. Friends, family, people he didn\u2019t even know. He was a great son. A great boyfriend to his girlfriends.\n\n\u201cHe was a good, raw, real dude. You don\u2019t come across that as often these days in the fighting world. There\u2019s a lot of cliquey (expletive) in the fights, but he didn\u2019t give a (expletive). He was just friends with everyone. It didn\u2019t make a difference.\u201d\n\nMaking good on a promise\n\nAs best friends, Costa and Carrier talked a lot \u2013 especially about career aspirations. At the time of his death, Costa was in limbo between his amateur and professional career. He wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever return, but shortly before Carrier\u2019s death, he made a promise that he would.\n\n\u201cI always told him I\u2019d take one more,\u201d Costa said. \u201cSo it was kind of something that I owed to him. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t passed, who knows? Maybe I would have never fought. Who really knows? I guess the real reason why I did come out of my layoff was because I owed that to him.\n\n\u201cI told him I had to do that. I would be doing not only myself a disservice, but a disservice to him and as a man to not take that fight like I said I would. I\u2019ll carry that with me because that was what drove me.\u201d\n\nIn April at UFC 236, Costa made his promotional debut and carried a picture of his fallen pal everywhere he went \u2013 on the scale, to the cage, and even when his loss was being announced by Bruce Buffer.\n\nIn a classy move, Costa\u2019s victorious opponent Brandon Davis decided to dedicate his mic time to Carrier. Getting Carrier\u2019s name on a UFC broadcast was a long sought-after goal for Costa. The move by Davis left him awestruck.\n\n\u201cI was standing at the official weigh-ins and I had his picture,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI was fighting so hard not to (expletive) cry, but I had a poker face on. I was getting that crying feeling like, \u2018We actually (expletive) did it.\u2019 It was in-(expletive)-sane.\n\n\u201c(Davis) beat me and he asked me after to hold the picture. That\u2019s (expletive) so cool. Him knowing how much that meant to me just to have him here with me. Now he\u2019s going to take the attention off the fact that he just beat me and put it on my friend who\u2019s no longer here? That\u2019s really (expletive) cool.\u201d\n\nA homecoming for two\n\nWhen Joe Lauzon, their coach and training partner, took on Michael Johnson at TD Garden in Boston in 2013, Costa and Carrier were in attendance. Costa remembers joking with Carrier about how one day they\u2019d be competing in the cage in that building.\n\nFast forward six years, and Randy Costa and Devin Carrier are about to make that dream a reality.\n\n\u201cIt was just a pipe dream, like, \u2018Imagine if we fought here? Holy (expletive), that\u2019d be insane,'\u201d Costa said. \u201cIt was never serious, but there was definitely a conversation. \u2018Imagine if that was us one day.\u2019 Now it\u2019s like, \u2018Dude, it is going to be us next week.'\u201d\n\nFriday night, Costa (4-1 MMA, 0-1 UFC) has his sophomore promotional outing when he takes on Boston Salmon (6-2 MMA, 0-1 UFC) at UFC on ESPN 6 at TD Garden.\n\nNot only will Costa carry Carrier\u2019s picture like usual, but Carrier\u2019s family will be in attendance. Seeing them? That\u2019s when Costa thinks the reality of a once dreamed-upon situation will sink in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already bigger than myself with the position that I\u2019m in,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI think there are a lot of people who say I shouldn\u2019t be here. (Expletive) them. It doesn\u2019t make a difference. Just that alone makes it much bigger than myself.\n\n\u201cOnce I see his family it\u2019s going to be night and day. It\u2019s going to switch, \u2018Holy (expletive). (Expletive) your feelings. Let\u2019s have some fun.\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d", "description": "UFC bantamweight Randy Costa carries a picture of fallen friend Devin Carrier everywhere when gearing up for fight night.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/randy.jpg?w=960&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
