Picture taken September 5, 2019.REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail\n\nAhmad Massoud, who was 12 years old when his father was assassinated days before the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, is among several Afghan politicians critical of the accord reached with the Taliban this week.\n\nWhile he is still relatively new to Afghan politics, the aura of his father\u2019s name adds weight to his words in a country where the habits of dynastic politics remain deeply ingrained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very secretive. It has happened behind closed doors,\u201d Massoud told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe see the peace deal as a great opportunity but how it has been managed is unfortunately disappointing,\u201d Massoud said. \u201cWe want to see clarity, we want to see people from all over the country involved in it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after some 10,000 supporters rallied at his father\u2019s mausoleum in the Panjshir Valley on Thursday, Massoud\u2019s comments reflect the deep suspicion many Afghans have of a deal reached without their involvement.\n\nThe accord would see thousands of U.S. troops withdrawn in exchange for Taliban promises not to let Afghanistan be used as a base for future attacks on the United States and its allies.\n\nIt is intended as a first step to a peace deal between the Taliban and wider Afghan society but it remains unclear what will happen next. The insurgents have refused to negotiate directly with the Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate \u201cpuppet\u201d regime and mistrust abounds.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani\u2019s spokesman said this week the government had serious concerns and wanted further clarification from Washington.\n\nAlthough details have not been made public, the fact that the accord appears to acknowledge the Taliban\u2019s self-described status as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has aroused particular anger.\n\n\u2018RED LINE\u2019\n\nMany Taliban officials have said the country\u2019s constitutional status should revert to the Islamic Emirate, but opponents see the term as a direct challenge to the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the state formed after the fall of the Taliban in 2001.\n\n\u201cFor us, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is our red line,\u201d Massoud said, adding that any change to the country\u2019s status could only come through a referendum.\n\nOpposition to the deal has been deepened by the Taliban\u2019s recent escalation of attacks, heightening fears that it may be impossible to reach a stable settlement once U.S. forces leave.\n\nMany have worried about a fracture along ethnic and regional lines, with Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras from the north and west against southern and eastern Pashtuns, the group that have supplied most of Afghanistan\u2019s rulers and where the Taliban draw most support. Memories of the 1990s civil war are vivid.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to see another war break out,\u201d Massoud said. \u201cThis peace must end war all at once.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe aggressive displays by supporters on the Sept. 9 anniversary of the death of Massoud\u2019s father, when armed bands drive through the streets of Kabul firing into the air, have led many to suspect that the old Mujahideen Northern Alliance could reform to oppose the Taliban.\n\nHowever Massoud insists that only a political settlement will be effective and that only government forces should be armed.\n\n\u201cAfter the peace process, no political group ... but the government should have guns,\u201d he said.", "description": "A \"secretive\" peace deal between United States and the Taliban could face wide resistance in Afghanistan if it opens the door to the insurgents' hardline regime, said the son of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the slain hero of the anti-Soviet resistance.", "authors": ["James Mackenzie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426905428&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF85158", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
