'The red card was significant but it can also galvanise a team.\n\nBut the Wales boss saw his side turn the game around with a 74th minute Ross Moriarty try\n\n'It is ironic the last time we were in a World Cup there was a red card and it was a one point game as well.\n\n'We did not play our best tonight but we showed some character and that is testament to this group of men and we can be excited about looking forward to a semi-final.\n\n'Alun Wyn Jones has been saying that we were 240 to do something you'll remember for the rest of your life. We're down to 160 now.\n\n'If you can't get excited about that, nothing will excite you. We're in a semi-final of a World Cup.\n\n'We've got a good record against South Africa as well. These young men have got a chance to create something really special.' Wainwright, who scored his first Welsh try in the win, spoke about the red card incident afterwards.\n\n'He had me by the neck to start off with,' he explained.\n\n'I was just trying to get the referee's attention as he was pulling me back.. Then the elbow came in and I was a bit surprised the referee didn't see it to start with.\n\nWales's quarter-final victory now sets up a last four clash against South Africa\n\n'Thankfully the TMO pulled it up and it was dealt with. Fair play to the boys they put the pressure on after and saw the game out. We're 160 minutes away from changing the rest of our lives and if we can get to the final it will be pretty special.\n\n'We want to create a legacy and that's the message Warren's been driving since the start of the Six Nations.' French captain Guilhem Guirado, who will now retire from Tests, said of the decision to award Wales their final try: 'The word cruel, is the appropriate word.\n\n'The way the match played out, what we managed to do and then the decision at the end of the match.\n\n'It was a crucial moment in the match, the decision was of the TMO and the referee was important, they said it was a rip therefore no forward pass. But we should have killed off the game before that.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER AT THE OITA STADIUM: Warren Gatland hailed the fighting spirit of his Welsh team as they booked a World Cup semi-final date with South Africa beating France by a point.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/14/19956714-0-image-a-125_1571578363927.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
