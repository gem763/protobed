We did a pilot brew for them, a k\u00f6lsch that they loved, so that\u2019s gonna be the first beer. It goes well with burgers,\" White Castle COO Josh Lampe told Brewhound.\n\nA White Castle spokesperson emphasized that they are still very much in an exploratory phase in terms of putting the brew together.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare to celebrate our 100th birthday in 2021, we are in the midst of planning lots of fun initiatives and surprises,\" a White Castle spokesman told Fox Business Network. \"It\u2019s too early for us to comment on any specifics about how widely available a White Castle inspired beer might be in our restaurants, but we\u2019re enjoying the creative process we\u2019re working on right now in real-time.\u201d\n\nAlthough the idea may seem novel, it\u2019s hardly the first or only fast-food franchise to dabble in offering beer. But it may be the first to put their name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcDonald\u2019s offers beers in several European locations. In France, you can order a Kronenbourg 1664 with your Big Mac. In Greece, you can get a Heineken. McDonalds also offers beer in South Korea, Austria, Spain and a handful of other European countries.\n\nBurger King offers domestic beers at their BK Whopper Bars, which are high-end branches of the Burger King brand, but those are only located in high-traffic areas like Orlando, Las Vegas and Miami. Chipotle offers beers at more than 900 U.S. locations as well.\n\nBut White Castle isn\u2019t just selling beer, they will be selling their own beer, technically. The company is just licensing the White Castle brand name to a brewery, but the idea remains the same.\n\nAs for White Castle\u2019s first offering, a k\u00f6lsch is brew that originated in Cologne, Germany, with a straw-yellow hue. The brew tends to be fruity and hoppy in flavor and it is served cold like a lager. K\u00f6lsch is one of the most strictly defined beer styles in Germany and it tends to go well with cheeses and bread-based dishes, making it a perfect choice for White Castle\u2019s first beer.\n\nThe beer rating website Untappd shows that Weyerbacher was testing out a pilot \"Slider Beer\" in May, and \"Crave Nation\" in August to positive feedback.\n\n\"Solid beer. A nice light change for Weyerbacher. Slightly hoppy. Light,\" one reviewer wrote about the Slider Beer. And, \"Super crushable kolsch!\" another reviewer posted in June.\n\nThe beer is rumored to hit select stores in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "White Castle is launching a beer to go along with their slider burgers at 400 locations beginning next year.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/White-Castle-Beer-1024x631.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
