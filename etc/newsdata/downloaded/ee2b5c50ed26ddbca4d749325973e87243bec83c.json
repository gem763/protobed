But the wreckage goes beyond Trump and involves the other two branches of government as well. The right wing\u2019s determination to control the Supreme Court is undermining its legitimacy as well as confidence in the U.S. Senate\u2019s approach to confirming nominees.\n\nFor the GOP, nothing will be allowed to derail its effort to create a generation-long conservative majority on the court. And that helps to explain why Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was railroaded through his confirmation hearings last year after what amounted to a pretend inquiry into the various charges against him.\n\nThe costs of this approach were underscored this weekend by a New York Times report that offers new corroboration for charges by Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her when both were undergraduates at Yale. In denying the charge, Kavanaugh told the Senate that had it been true, the incident would have been \u201cthe talk of the campus.\u201d Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly \u2014 drawing on their new book, \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation\u201d \u2014 write tellingly: \u201cOur reporting suggests that it was.\u201d\n\nMore than that, they report on an entirely separate incident involving Kavanaugh that Max Stier, a classmate of Ramirez\u2019s, brought to the attention of the Senate and the FBI at the time of the hearings. It involved, they write, \u201ca different drunken dorm party\u201d where, according to the allegation, Kavanaugh had a different inappropriate encounter with a female student. Stier is president of the thoroughly bipartisan and widely respected Partnership for Public Service. From my experience, he is the last person who would want to get into the middle of an ideological fight \u2014 unless his conscience required him to.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nHere is the institutionally devastating part of their story: Ramirez\u2019s legal team gave the FBI a list of \u201cat least 25 individuals who may have had corroborating evidence\u201d of her story. The bureau, the authors report, \u201cinterviewed none of them.\u201d Nor did the FBI look into Stier\u2019s account.\n\n\u00a9 Jim Bourg/Reuters President Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh at his ceremonial public swearing-in in the White House on Oct. 8, 2018. Now let\u2019s take a step back: If Senate Republicans had declared Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior as a high school and college student off-limits, they would have risked a firestorm, but at least they would have been honest about what they were up to.\n\nHowever, they could not take this route once they agreed to hear psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s four hours of testimony about her charge that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s when both were in high school. Ford\u2019s testimony was so credible \u2014 Republican after Republican praised her \u2014 that the GOP was forced to agree to a brief FBI investigation.\n\nBut it was such a sharply constrained investigation that neither Kavanaugh nor Ford was questioned, and the other allegations against Kavanaugh were ignored. \u201cThe process was a sham,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee who is seeking her party\u2019s presidential nomination, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d She was not being hyperbolic. In the wake of the new revelations, three other Democratic contenders quickly called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThis leaves it to journalists to keep exploring questions the Senate refused to settle. And it leaves the court and the country in a terrible place.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had already signaled that court packing took priority over due process when he refused even to hold a hearing on President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the court in 2016. This opened the way for Trump to name two conservatives to the court, Kavanaugh and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch for the seat Garland was denied.\n\nThe administration seems eager to flaunt the right\u2019s new judicial power. In an in-your-face move, Attorney General William P. Barr will present the Attorney General\u2019s Award for Distinguished Service \u2014 it typically goes to attorneys who worked difficult and important cases \u2014 to those who worked \u201cto support the nomination\u201d of Kavanaugh. Take that, libs and Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers.\n\nAnd the administration is developing the habit of skipping the normal appeals process to advance cases to a Supreme Court it has shaped to its liking. This drew a sharp rebuke from Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent last week when the court overturned a lower court\u2019s national injunction against the administration\u2019s asylum policy. She said colleagues\u2019 \u201cprecipitous\u201d ruling \u201csidesteps the ordinary judicial process to allow the Government to implement a rule that bypassed the ordinary rulemaking \u00adprocess.\u201d\n\nIt was Kavanaugh who said in his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee at his 2018 hearing: \u201cThe Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution.\u201d But it\u2019s impossible not to view the court in exactly that way, thanks to a GOP determined to control it by any means at its disposal. It\u2019s why questions \u2014 about Kavanaugh and the court itself \u2014 will continue to haunt us.\n\nRead more from E.J.
