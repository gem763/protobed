The attempt to keep Trump off the California primary ballot unless he provides his tax returns is on hold \u2026 for now.\n\nU.S. District Judge Morrison C. England Jr. issued an opinion that California\u2019s new law likely violates the Constitution. In September he signaled that this would likely be his opinion. He said he would issue a formal ruling by October 1 and he did. The Trump campaign and Republican parties sued over the law which requires candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on the March 2020 primary ballot.\n\nThe stunt to demand the release of President Trump\u2019s tax returns didn\u2019t sit well with the judge \u2013 a George W. Bush appointee. Governor Newsom signed it into law in July. In September Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, was hopeful.\n\nLawyers for Trump and Republicans argue that it violates the U.S. Constitution by adding an additional requirement to run for president. They also said a federal law requiring presidents to disclose financial information supersedes state law. \u201cWe are encouraged that the federal court tentatively concluded that a preliminary injunction should be granted,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer Jay Sekulow said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s written order. It remains our position that the law is unconstitutional because states are not permitted to add additional requirements for candidates for president, and that the law violates the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe new California law requires candidates for governor or president to file copies of five years of tax returns with the California Secretary of State\u2019s office. Refusal to do so will mean the candidate will not appear on the primary ballot. The law targets just those two offices \u2013 it doesn\u2019t apply to general elections. Gov. Newsom claimed at the time he signed the bill into law that California has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d, whatever that means.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he signed the law because California has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to hold candidates to high ethical standards. The Trump campaign sued, arguing the law seeks to add another qualification for running for president, something state governments don\u2019t have the authority to do.\n\nIt is unclear exactly why Newsom thinks that California is so special. California is one of fifty states, not a special entity of its own. Let\u2019s face it, this is just an attempt to press Trump for tax documents he hasn\u2019t provided to the public. Democrats would love for a state to be successful in an attempt to keep Trump off the state\u2019s primary ballot and no doubt more would follow suit if the federal court rules in favor of such an attempt. The Trump campaign argues that state governments don\u2019t have the authority to add an additional qualification for those running for president.\n\nThe judge is sympathetic to the state\u2019s demand but his priority is to rule as the Constitution dictates.\n\nIn his 24-page ruling, Morrison wrote the state\u2019s concerns are \u201cboth legitimate and understandable,\u201d highlighting that candidates have offered \u201cunnecessary and irrelevant excuses for shielding the public from such information.\u201d \u201cIt is not the job of the courts, however, to decide whether a tax return disclosure requirement is good policy or makes political sense,\u201d wrote Morrison, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush. \u201cInstead, it is the court\u2019s job to make sure the Constitution wins.\u201d\n\nJudge Morrison rightfully pointed out the obvious \u2013 California is a Democrat-controlled state. The California legislature passed legislation that specifically targets a Republican president. The law violates Trump\u2019s First Amendment right \u201cof associating with voters who share his political beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dangerous precedent set by this act, allowing the controlling party in any state\u2019s legislature to add substantive requirements as a precondition to qualifying for the state\u2019s presidential primary ballot, should concern all candidates alike,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThis move by the California legislature smacked of petty partisan politics from the beginning. It is in line with the blatant authoritarianism on display by the Democrats running for president and in top leadership. Whether it is Joe Biden\u2019s campaign demanding that Rudy Guiliani be shunned by networks, or Kamala Harris calling on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account, or Speaker Pelosi allowing impeachment inquiries to begin without holding a formal vote so that the minority (Republicans) can be heard, the Democrats are on quite a roll. It does not bode well for the future of our country if they are successful and take back the White House in 2020, or the Senate, for that matter.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling blocking the bill will be appealed.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s chief elections officer on Tuesday said he plans to appeal the decision. \u201cCalifornia will appeal this ruling and we will continue to make our thorough, thoughtful argument for stronger financial disclosure requirements for presidential and gubernatorial candidates,\u201d Padilla said, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cOur elected leaders have a legal and moral obligation to be transparent with voters about potential conflicts of interest. This law is fundamental to preserving and protecting American democracy.\u201d\n\nIf the appeal is successful, November 26 will be the deadline to file tax returns for California\u2019s March 3 presidential primary.", "description": "A win is a win.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1dab81f6-b193-41a4-bf1f-569d26fc8f6e.jpg"}
