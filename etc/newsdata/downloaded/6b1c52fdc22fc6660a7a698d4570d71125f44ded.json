The philosophy is that immigrants should pay their own way.\n\nAn exception is made for the indigent, who have been able to apply for a fee waiver, using one of the three categories of income, use of a means-tested welfare program, or proving hardship.\n\nThe new rules eliminate the welfare program avenue.\n\nThe agency doled out nearly $300 million in fee waivers in fiscal 2018, or 6% of its budget. Most of those waivers were granted under the soon-to-be-eliminated welfare program test.\n\nBut the agency said many of those people could qualify under the hardship or poverty level tests, so it\u2019s not clear whether there will be a major drop in the number of waivers granted.\n\nThe agency said, though, that allowing a patchwork of state laws to determine who gets a waiver is no way to run a national program. For example, someone may qualify for food stamps in California but not in New Mexico, meaning that if that person were an immigrant applicant he could get a waiver if he lived in California, but not if he lived in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unfair criterion, we think, and it\u2019s very hard to administer,\u201d an agency official told The Washington Times.\n\nThe new policy takes effect for applications filed Dec. 2 and beyond.\n\nAlso part of the new policy is a requirement that anyone applying for a waiver fill out the correct form.\n\nUp to now, applicants had a choice of filling out the form or writing a letter. In each case, they were supposed to send proof.\n\nThe USCIS official told The Times they don\u2019t expect the new form requirement to affect who is eligible to apply. Someone applying for an immigration benefit is already filling out another application form anyway.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
