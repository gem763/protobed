Bardo says it will either regroup or be acquired by a rival.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange Group (LSE.LN) shares stumbled 6% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (0388.HK) ended its attempts to buy the LSE. It now needs to wait six months if it wants to bid again. The LSE had said it was opposed to the offer.\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.LN) shares ran into profit taking, falling 5%, after announcing full-year profits would be at the top end of expectations, second-half revenue per seat would be above guidance and fiscal first-quarter bookings were in line with last year.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 05:54 ET (09:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
