He was believed to be 48.\n\n\"He didn't die a hero, he died a coward, crying, whimpering and screaming,\" Trump said.\n\nNews of his death came five years after the Islamic State humiliated Iraq's military by seizing nearly a third of the country. Steady battlefield losses in the last two years saw the group's territory shrink from an area the size of Britain to a speck in the Euphrates River valley. In April, Kurdish-led forces backed by Washington declared the territorial defeat of IS after liberating the village of Baghouz in eastern Syria, the group's last bastion.\n\nMilitants under al-Baghdadi's command deftly exploited social media to tout the group's military successes, document their mass slaughter, beheadings and stonings, and promote their cause to a global audience.\n\nThe impact of al-Baghdadi's death on future attacks is unclear: The shadowy leader had been largely regarded as a figurehead of the global terror network and was described as \"irrelevant\" by a coalition spokesman in 2017. The group also has lost many of its senior commanders in airstrikes since 2015.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born as Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad, according to a U.N. sanctions list.\n\nA 2014 biography in online jihadi forums traced his lineage to the Prophet Muhammad's Quraysh tribe. Its unconfirmed claims said al-Baghdadi earned a doctorate from Saddam University for Islamic Studies. It says he promoted the Salafi jihadi movement, which advocates \"holy war\" to bring about a strict version of Islamic law, or Shariah.\n\nAccording to IS-affiliated websites, al-Baghdadi was detained by U.S. forces in Iraq in 2004 for his militant activity, although he was considered a civilian detainee. He was released 10 months later and joined the al-Qaida branch in Iraq of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nAfter Al-Zarqawi was killed by a U.S. airstrike in 2006, al-Baghdadi became a trusted aide to two senior figures, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri, assuming control of the group, known then as the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nThe group, al-Qaida's official franchise in Iraq, had been weakened by years of U.S. and Iraqi raids and the mobilization of Sunni fighters opposed to its extremist ideology. But al-Baghdadi deployed suicide attackers, car bombs and gunmen against Iraqi forces and Shiite civilians as the U.S. drew down its troops ahead of a 2011 withdrawal. Prison breaks bolstered his group's ranks.\n\nAmid the uprising against President Bashar Assad in Syria, he sent comrades there to create a Sunni extremist group known as the Nusra Front, which more moderate Sunni rebels initially welcomed.\n\nOver time, more of his fighters and possibly al-Baghdadi himself relocated to Syria, pursuing plans to restore a medieval Islamic state, or caliphate, spanning both Iraq and greater Syria. In April 2013, al-Baghdadi announced what amounted to a hostile takeover of the Nusra Front, merging it into a new group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The move caught both the Nusra Front and al-Qaida's central command off guard.\n\nNusra Front leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani refused to accept the takeover. Ayman al-Zawahri, al-Qaida's top leader, ordered al-Baghdadi's group abolished. Al-Baghdadi would not compromise, and al-Qaida eventually distanced itself, saying it had no connection to al-Baghdadi's group.\n\nIt went on to take control of key cities such as Raqqa, Syria, and Fallujah, Iraq. Then came the June 2014 offensive that drew the U.S. back into Iraq: Al-Baghdadi's militants and allied Sunni fighters seized Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul and other Sunni-dominated communities. Government troops put up little resistance, and al-Baghdadi's fighters posted videos of its forces killing captured Shiite troops.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi sought to establish an Islamic \"caliphate\" across Syria and Iraq, but he might be remembered more as the ruthlessly calculating leader of the Islamic State group who brought terror to the heart of Europe and set up a short-lived organization so extreme that it was shunned", "authors": ["Adam Schreck", "Zeina Karam"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5dad6wqC2kEPInarGd0k1g--~B/aD05NDI7dz05OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/351f6a4e8be42ff690de84a18f8396b9", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
