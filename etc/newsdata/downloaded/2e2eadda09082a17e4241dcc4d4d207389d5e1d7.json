REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo\n\nThe question of how to keep Ireland\u2019s border with the British region of Northern Ireland open is the key sticking point in talks to secure an orderly British exit from the EU and avoid the economic disruption of no-deal exit on Oct. 31.\n\nTo date the British government has offered \u201cnothing that comes close\u201d to what is needed to secure Irish and EU agreement, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown a \u201cwillingness to try and explore new approaches,\u201d Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs the discussion gets more real, and I hope more honest, I hope that will feed into the discussions that are now needed in the context of anything that can close the gaps,\u201d said Coveney, speaking at an annual meeting of his Fine Gael party.\n\n\u201cWe will respond positively if there are suggestions and new approaches that are based on realism in terms of what will actually work,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what the British government brings forward.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s preferred method of keeping the border open is via a \u201cbackstop\u201d mechanism that would ensure that either Northern Ireland or all of the United Kingdom remains in regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.\n\nAsked whether the Northern Ireland-only option was dead after the British government on Tuesday said it was not seeking it, Coveney said nothing had been taken off the table.\n\n\u201cReally this is a matter for the British government,\u201d he said.\n\nIn parallel to the Brexit talks, the Irish government is negotiating with the European Commission about what checks it would have to impose on the border to protect the EU single market if the United Kingdom leaves without a deal.\n\nCoveney said the talks were ongoing about imposing the \u201cminimal level of checks that is credible\u201d, away from the border. Such implementation would likely be imposed after Britain leaves, he added.\n\nBut the moves would be temporary as an agreement on keeping the border open would be a prerequisite to any talks on a trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t regard those checks that may be needed in a no-deal scenario as a permanent arrangement,\u201d Coveney said. \u201cNot by a long shot.\u201d", "description": "The European Union would respond positively if the British government shifts its position in Brexit talks in the coming weeks as the dangers of a no-deal exit become clearer, Ireland's foreign minister said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Conor Humphries", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429061042&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0SF", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
