In a competitive series, a game can last five or six hours. A fan must tough out the long and boring parts, waiting with bated breath for the action in between.\n\nWhat comes part and parcel with baseball is the art of heckling. Baseball fans believe firmly in the American tradition of yelling. Boo your opponent, cheer your home team, embrace a group mentality \u2014 this is what it means to love the game. This, more importantly, is what it means to be an American.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

In so doing, Trump himself became a target of baseball\u2019s notorious heckling. And that heckling was nothing short of patriotic.\n\nMet with boos, and calls to \u201cLock Him Up,\u201d Trump finally got a dose of the medicine he has been doling out to his rally-goers since 2015. \u201cLock Her Up\u201d felt cringe-worthy and wrong when tossed at former Secretary Clinton, who was absolved of wrongdoing on several occasions, most notably by the FBI. But, as it relates to Trump, who has freely admitted to consorting with a foreign power to get dirt on his political opponent, \u201cLock Him Up\u201d suddenly feels like an appropriate rally cry.\n\nBaseball fans, who departed from their cheers and jeers at players last night to direct one at the president, were proving their diehard patriotism. They proved, too, that Americans have had enough of this criminal president.\n\nHeckling, in baseball, enjoys a long tradition. In 2004, famed Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, who once called the New York Yankees his \u201cdaddy,\u201d was met with chants of \u201cWho\u2019s Your Daddy\u201d at the American League Championship Series against that rival team. If that chant feels cheeky, know that baseball is about cheekiness and pushing boundaries. Baseball is about dedication and devotion and seeing your team through to the bitter end. That season, the Red Sox came back from 0-3 to win the series against the Yankees. That October, the Red Sox would go on to win their first World Series title since 1918. But the chant? That chant brought Yankees fans together, united them in a common goal. Winning was important, yes, but so was sticking together.\n\nIn the case of Trump vs. the Baseball Stadium, what we witnessed, too, was unity at work. Astros fans and Nationals fans rose to the occasion, refusing to normalize a president who has presided over an administration rife with corruption and bad behavior. There was no mistaking the mood in that stadium: The president was not a welcome guest. And that reflects the mood of the American people.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He is not being maligned for no good purpose. The declarations against him, shouted from the stands by baseball lovers \u2014 by Americans \u2014 indicate a tipping point, as our country moves farther away from accepting this new status quo.\n\nThe president does not represent the better angels of the American spirit. What better place to remind him of that one certain truth than amid the echoes and cacophony of the baseball stadium?\n\nLike every other critique that he has faced in his nearly mature presidency, Trump will manipulate the truth of Game 5. I expect that he will convert obvious boos into enthusiastic yays, that he will attribute the chant of \u201cLock Him Up\u201d to a few loudmouthed \u201cDo Nothing Democrats\u201d who happen to have voices that carry. But fans of America\u2019s pastime, like me, know the truth \u2014 and that truth is that the president\u2019s appearance at the World Series offended us, because he personifies everything that baseball is not: traitorous, lazy, un-American, intellectually disinterested, and mean-spirited.\n\nThe only reasonable gift to bestow upon an interloper \u2014 upon someone dedicated to America\u2019s systematic dismantling \u2014 is the gift that proves our patriotism, and our refusal to accept the rewriting of our country\u2019s narrative. The only appropriate thing to do is boo.", "description": "America\u2019s favorite pastime is baseball: that long, drawn-out game that requires patience, some wit, and a lot of attention to detail.
