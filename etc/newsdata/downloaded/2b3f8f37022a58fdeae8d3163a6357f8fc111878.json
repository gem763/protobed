Through the acquisition of ReachLocal in August 2016, the NETWORK expanded its digital capabilities to include web presence optimization, as well as search and social digital lead generation.

LOCALiQ now combines these solutions with existing online and offline advertising offerings into one comprehensive, robust solution set that will help businesses effectively reach consumers across any platform.\n\n\u201cUSA TODAY NETWORK embodies trust and transparency in our local communities, through our commitment to great journalism and our desire to deliver a robust marketing solution to businesses to help them succeed,\u201d said Sharon Rowlands, President, USA TODAY NETWORK Marketing Solutions. \u201cWe have been on a transformative journey to be the partner businesses trust with their marketing investments.

Businesses today are challenged with many marketing choices and limited resources, and are not effectively utilizing their marketing budgets to reach engaged consumers.
