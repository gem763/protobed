Photo: Courtesy of the retailer\n\nWhen it comes to durable boots that you can rely on in rainy, snowy, slushy, icy, or just cold weather, L.L. Bean makes some of the sturdiest you can get. Boots from the outdoor-gear retailer based in Maine appeared in our expert-recommended lists of stylish rain boots for men, women, and kids, as well as in our expert-curated packing guide for an Alaskan cruise. The classic look of a lot of L.L. Bean boots makes them even more appealing because they will never go out of style over the years (maybe even decades) you will wear them. Now through October 14, the Bean is offering 20 percent off on a lot of fall-appropriate jackets, clothes, and shoes, and while skimming through the selection, we noticed that the discount applies to a handful of already-on-sale boots for women, men, and kids \u2014 slashing their prices by as much as 64 percent. All of the boots below have grippy soles to keep you steady on slippery surfaces, and many are waterproof (those that aren\u2019t fully waterproof are water-resistant, according to the brand and reviewers), making them the exact type of footwear you want in your closet as fall and then winter settles in. If you like any, we suggest acting fast, as some sizes are already sold out. Note: The men\u2019s and women\u2019s boots below require entering the code BEAN20 at checkout to get the full discount.\n\nFor women\n\nL.L.
