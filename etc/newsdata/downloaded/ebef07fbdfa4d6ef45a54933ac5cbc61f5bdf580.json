So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mum or trying to be a newlywed.'\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are joined by her mother, Doria Ragland, as they show their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, to the Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh at Windsor Castle\n\nShe added: 'And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I\u2019m OK. But it\u2019s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.'\n\nThe interview, which has since been viewed tens of millions of times on Twitter alone, triggered huge public debate about their roles in the Royal Family.\n\nBut Mr Pierce defended his friend and former co-star, doubling down on comments he made during his Desert Island Discs interview on Sunday, where he said that Ms Markle was 'always sweet, always kind.'\n\nThe GMB interview came two days after the broadcast of his Desert Island Discs feature, which he described as 'a profound act of self reflection' and a 'gift'.\n\nDuring the broadcast, he told host Lauren Laverne how he reassured the then Duchess-to-be that she would 'have a friend' in him always.'\n\nHe said: 'I said \"Look, listen, your world is going to be forever changed and no matter where you are, you can always know that you have a friend in me\"'.\n\nThe actor also revealed how he once saved the Duchess from being photographed wearing a costume ring after she had filmed scenes in which her character got engaged to Mike Ross, played by Patrick J. Adams.\n\nHe said: 'We were shooting one day, before the engagement. In the show she was engaged, and she had a ring on.\n\n'We were about to get out of the car and I said: \u201cDon\u2019t get out. Give us the ring. There\u2019s a paparazzi down the street. If a photograph got out with you with a ring on it, it would explode all over the world\".\n\nHe said: 'I said \"Look, listen, your world is going to be forever changed and no matter where you are, you can always know that you have a friend in me\"\n\nMr Pierce went on to describe the Duchess, who he worked with from 2013, as 'always sweet, always kind.'\n\nIn Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, viewers were offered an insight into the emotional journey the 'vulnerable and bruised' royal couple have been catapulted into since their wedding while following their ten-day tour of southern Africa.\n\nShe said, 'We are taking it one day at a time,' before admitting that the couple are currently 'existing, not living.'\n\nIn the hour-long documentary, Harry also voiced his desire to leave the UK and said he considers living in Africa one day.\n\nHe said: 'I don't know where we could live in Africa at the moment.\n\n'We've just come from Cape Town, that would be an amazing place for us to be able to to base ourselves, of course it would.\n\n'But with all the problems that are going on there I just don't see how we would be able to really make as much difference as we'd want to.'", "description": "Wendell Pierce, 55, from New Orleans, Louisiana, who played Robert Zane in the long running lawyer series, said Ms Markle's mother would have prepared her for 'the ugly side of human nature'.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20320884-0-image-a-18_1572346515282.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
