You just can\u2019t do it, right?\" he added. \"So you just go, \u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019\"\n\nKevin Winter / Getty Images Todd Phillips with Hangover stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis in 2013.\n\nPhillips said the idea for Joker \u2014 an antihero comic book origin story in the vein of Taxi Driver set in a dark and gritty 1970s Gotham \u2014 stemmed from a desire to want to remain irreverent, but not funny. \"With all my comedies \u2014 I think that what comedies in general all have in common \u2014 is they\u2019re irreverent,\" he said. \"So I go, \u2018How do I do something irreverent, but fuck comedy? Oh I know, let\u2019s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this.\u2019 And so that\u2019s really where that came from.\u201d Tuesday's Vanity Fair interview marked the second time in a week that Phillips had criticized left-wing politics as he promotes his film. Addressing criticisms that the movie promotes a sympathetic origin story for male violence, as well concerns that it will be championed by so-called incels (i.e., misogynist \"involuntary celibates\" who blame women for not wanting to sleep with them), Phillips blamed the controversy around the movie on the \"far left.\" \u201cI think it\u2019s because outrage is a commodity. I think it\u2019s something that has been a commodity for a while,\u201d he told the Wrap. \u201cWhat\u2019s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It\u2019s really been eye-opening for me.\u201d\n\nNiko Tavernise/Warner Bros.", "description": "The director of Old School, Road Trip, and The Hangover trilogy said stars don't want to offend people nowadays.", "authors": ["David Mack", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-10/2/0/campaign_images/5814010f3460/todd-phillips-blamed-woke-culture-for-killing-com-2-1001-1569975034-0_dblbig.jpg"}
