Three Democratic-led House committees are investigating Mr Trump.\n\nThe eight page letter signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone rejected the entire process underway in the House of Representatives, which is looking into whether Trump abused his office by seeking a corruption probe in Ukraine of 2020 election rival Joe Biden.\n\n\"President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections,\" the letter said.\n\nThe White House said it objected especially to the fact that the lower house had not held a formal vote to launch the impeachment enquiry.\n\nThe Trump administration blocked a key witness in the Ukraine scandal from testifying to the House of Representatives' impeachment investigation on Tuesday, leading Democrats to accuse the president of stonewalling their probe.\n\nGordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, had been expected to answer questions on his role in Donald Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nBut less than two hours before he was scheduled to appear before members of three House committees, it emerged the US State Department had blocked him from testifying.\n\nLeading Democrats condemned the action and said they would issue a subpoena for Mr Sonland's testimony, as well as \"highly relevant\" emails and text messages from the ambassador that they claim the State Department has refused to turn over.\n\nMr Trump said on Twitter that he \u201cwould love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify\" but accused the impeachment inquiry of being \"a totally compromised kangaroo court\".\n\nThe move escalates attempts by the Trump administration to limit co-operation between its senior officials and the investigation.\n\nMike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, last week accused Democrats of harassment and abuse after they contacted Mr Sondland and other officials directly to request interviews.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint which alleged that the US president had pushed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Mr Biden, the leading Democrat in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nAs part of that inquiry, the House Intelligence Committee released a trove of text messages last week which revealed Mr Sondland played a central role in advancing Mr Trump's agenda in Ukraine.\n\nThe messages, released by the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry, show that senior US officials repeatedly pushed to secure an investigation into Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who once worked for a Ukrainian gas company, even going as far as to help draft an announcement to be put out by Ukraine.\n\nThe officials also teased the possibility of a White House meeting for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, while making the request.\n\nHowever with almost $400 million of US military aid to Ukraine held back as talks continued, one of the officials, William Taylor, began to raise concerns.\n\nIn one text Mr Taylor, the Charge d\u2019Affaires at the US embassy in Ukraine, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nMr Sondland replies that Mr Taylor is wrong about the president's \"intentions\", saying there is no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d.\n\nIn another Mr Taylor says: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Mr Sondland texts back: \u201cCall me.\u201d", "description": "The White House has officially refused to co-operate with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Rozina Sabur"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_sKpxcshKa1QzGHQAoE3UQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/77e9473379500aaf56d7dec72a7a3e99", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
