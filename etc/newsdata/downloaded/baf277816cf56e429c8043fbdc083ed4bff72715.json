The two old enemies last fought a deadly month-long war with each other in July 2006.\n\nLebanese soldiers, who do not have air defence systems, opened fire at Israeli drones in southern Lebanon earlier this week.\n\nIsraeli aircraft regularly enter Lebanese airspace, but it is rare for Lebanon's army to target them. Beirut has sent several complaints to the United Nations before about Israeli drones and jets breaching its airspace.
