Tackling teen vaping is one of those child health issues that appeals to a wide swath of voters \u2014 and Democrats have scheduled hearings and demanded prompt action from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBut Trump said his wife\u2019s pressure was key. In comparison with past first ladies, she has had a low profile on public policy. Here, in contrast, she persuaded her husband to dramatically shift the government\u2019s approach to a massive, growing and politically connected industry. That\u2019s something that neither federal regulators nor Capitol Hill had been able to do.\n\n\u201cMelania has the same concerns as any mom with a 13-year-old child,\u201d said a former Trump adviser who remains close to the White House. \u201cWhether it\u2019s bullying or smoking \u2026 moms want their kids to be safe. And in this case, she whispers in the ear of the American president who can actually do something about this crisis that moms care about.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
