More\n\nThe most common story used by Sarpong and his conspirators was that they were military personnel stationed in Syria who were awarded gold bars. The conspirators told many of the victims their money would be reimbursed once the gold bars arrived in the United States.\n\nIn one case, a conspirator claimed he was a U.S. solider stationed in Syria who had recovered gold bars worth $12 million and needed help bringing them over. He sent her a fictitious airway bill showing that two trunks with \"family treasure\" would be sent to her, along with a fake United Nations Identity Card that identified him as an Israeli citizen and UN delivery agent.\n\nShe wired him more than $93,000 and they planned to meet at the Baltimore/Washington International on June 13, 2018. The next day she died by suicide.\n\nAuthorities say Sarpong and his conspirators used various email accounts and Voice Over Internet protocol phone numbers to communicate with the victims and instruct them where to wire money.\n\nVictims, on occasion, also sent money via personal and cashier's checks.\n\nAuthorities say the funds were then withdrawn in cash, wired to other domestic bank accounts and wired to conspirators in Ghana.\n\nSarpong, who was found posting photographs of himself with large amounts of cash, high-end cars and expensive jewelry, personally received $823,386 in the scheme, authorities said.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday, Sarpong was active on social media and \"bragged about his wealth.\"\n\nAuthorities say on March 2, 2017, Sarpong posted a photograph of himself sitting in a car with a large stack of money up to his ear like a cellphone with a caption that read \"WakeUp With 100k... One Time. Making A phone Call To Let My Bank Know Am Coming.\"\n\nIn a May 29, 2017 post, Sarpong posted a photograph of himself in front of a white Mercedes with the comment \"BloodyMoney,\" according to the complaint.\n\nOn December 12, 2018, Sarpong posted a photograph of himself with an unidentified male with the comment \"BigBusiness Done...Now We Waiting For The Checks To Clear,\" authorities said.\n\nSarpong faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to Carpenito.\n\nFollow Anthony Coppola on Twitter @AVCoppola.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Vineland Daily Journal: Man charged in $2M online dating scheme allegedly posed as soldier\n\n\n\n", "description": "Authorities say the 35-year-old New Jersey man worked with conspirators in Ghana to deceive the victims.", "authors": ["Anthony V.
