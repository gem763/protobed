If they come down strong and heavy, it\u2019s going to create some backlash.'", "description": "Victorian businesses are exploiting a loophole so they can continue to give out single use plastic bags despite incoming bans and legislation.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19399300-0-image-a-55_1570457724962.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
