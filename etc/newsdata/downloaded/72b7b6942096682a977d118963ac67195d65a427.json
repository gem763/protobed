Johann Rehbogen - also accused of complicity in mass murder at Stutthof - had his trial suspended in December 2018 after the 95-year-old was hospitalised. It is unlikely proceedings will be restarted.\n\nWhat was Stutthoff?\n\nStutthof was set up in September 1939 east of Danzig - now the Polish city of Gdansk - as an internment camp in the wake of the Nazi invasion of Poland. It was officially designated a concentration camp in 1942.\n\nIt was the first such camp built outside of German borders in the war and the last to be liberated. Stutthof was liberated by the Soviet Army on 9 May 1945.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Stutthof has been preserved as a museum\n\nMore than 65,000 people are thought to have died in the camp. Guards began using gas chambers in June 1944, while a number of forced labour factories were set up in the area to help make equipment for the Nazi war machine.\n\nThere is evidence that Dr Rudolf Spanner used fat collected from human corpses at Stutthof to make soap.", "description": "Bruno Dey, 93, will go on trial for complicity in mass murder at a Nazi death camp on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07f05xx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
