Calder\u00f3n hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico\u2019s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed. Simultaneously Calder\u00f3n also began pursuing the so-called \u201ckingpin strategy\u201d by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders. That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps \u2013 notably Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva who was gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009 \u2013 but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie. Under Calder\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government\u2019s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world\u2019s most murderous mafia groups. But Calder\u00f3n\u2019s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa\u2019s Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. When \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was arrested in early 2016, Mexico\u2019s president bragged: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d. But the violence went on. By the time Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain. The leftwing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime, offering vocational training to more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels. \u201cIt will be virtually impossible to achieve peace without justice and [social] welfare,\u201d Amlo said, promising to slash the murder rate from an average of 89 killings per day with his \u201chugs not bullets\u201d doctrine. Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong \"National Guard\". But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants. Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.\n\n\u201cWe want everything to be known. That\u2019s how we demonstrate the responsibility of the actions taken in a complex, difficult, and very serious situation,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we demonstrate that the most important thing is to protect citizens, to protect life.\u201d\n\nThe defence secretary, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, described Ovidio, 29, as \u201cone of the main traffickers\u201d of methamphetamines and fentanyl into the United States, and said the aborted operation stemmed from an arrest warrant with a view to extradition issued on 13 September.\n\nThe general said a special unit within the security forces was dispatched to Culiac\u00e1n on 9 October with an arrest plan that involved the establishment of an inner and outer security cordon as soon as intelligence confirmed that Ovidio was at a house in the centre of the city.\n\nThings began to fall apart, however, when attacks by gunmen prevented soldiers and members of the national guard from reaching their positions on the outer cordon.\n\nPressure increased, he said, when gunmen attacked blocks of flats occupied by the families of military personnel and took an officer and nine soldiers hostage.\n\nCritics have argued that the authorities should have sent a larger force for the operation.\n\nBut Sandoval emphasized the gunmens\u2019 military-grade arsenal, which included armoured vehicles, .50-calibre machine guns, and rocket launchers that hit a helicopter, and argued that to defeat the cartel force, the the army would have had to use even superior firepower \u2013 which would have inevitably put civilians at risk.\n\nThe government says eight people died during the operation, though local media has put the death toll at 13.\n\nAs fighting raged across the city, it appears that the younger Guzm\u00e1n never left the house were he was detained.\n\nVideo shot at the property shows him passing a handgun to an associate before emerging into a garage, fiddling with a black baseball cap before soldiers back him against the wall.\n\nWith intense gunfire in the background, a soldier shouts at him: \u201cTell your people to stop this!\u201d after which he is seen holding a mobile phone.\n\n'We do not want war': Mexico president defends release of El Chapo\u2019s son Read more\n\n\u201cCall it off, please, I\u2019ve given myself up,\u201d he is heard saying. \u201cNow stop it, calm down, there\u2019s nothing to be done \u2026 Tell them to pull back, I don\u2019t want this,\u201d he continues.\n\nBut the attacks continued and four hours after the operation began, officials in Mexico City ordered security forces to withdraw.\n\nInitial reaction to the report included some shock, and even admiration, that the government had been so open about such a disastrous event.\n\nBut many questions remain unanswered, including who gave the go-ahead for such an obviously badly planned operation and how the cartel obtained the intelligence to mount an effective rescue operation so quickly.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has promised to answer outstanding doubts at a press conference on Thursday.", "description": "Government report on failed operation shows soldiers pushing Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez to tell brothers to call off rescue attempt", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872aaf5864cee6fa4fa45c396cd317dbea0f689c/0_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed8e2ce2918bedf9a4f84e44674d2f17", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
