Block the sender? No, she decided to take a chance, see his Gundam, and meet the man in question.\n\nThat first meeting took place in April 2016 and shortly afterwards Elle tweeted: \"Today I met the Gundam guy in person by chance and I don't know, I might marry him.\"\n\nThe couple's mutual love of Gundam - several Japanese TV series about robots, plus the model kits and merchandise - was the start of their love story.\n\nThe \"Gundam man\" was John Grasso, and after months of direct messaging and texting, the pair finally met.\n\n\"I took a chance on him because John wasn't afraid to let me into his life, be himself, and share his hobbies and passions with me. He genuinely wanted to connect on levels so real, deep, and human.\"\n\nElle adds: \"When we met, I knew instantly my search for a partner in life was over.\"\n\nThe couple, from New Jersey, USA, got engaged in 2017, eloped on 1 August 2019 and were married in a small ceremony at a hotel in San Francisco.\n\n\"Our parents knew of our elopement so I guess it wasn't exactly us running away - but we wanted to do something memorable!\"\n\nAlthough the wedding did not have a Gundam theme, the couple are planning a ceremony and reception next year for friends and family where Elle's hope is to have Gundam elements \"sprinkled\" throughout.\n\nAnd the honeymoon? If money allows, says Elle, \"it would be our dream come true to go to Japan,\" of course.\n\nImage copyright @mitsurutenma Image caption John and Elle on their wedding day\n\nThe couple are not the only ones to have met through an appreciation of Gundam.\n\nOther fans of the Japanese giant robots have been commenting on Twitter about their Gundam-inspired weddings and close encounters which led to lifelong romance.\n\nWhat is Gundam?\n\nThe Gundam story is about a war between space colonies and Earth\n\nIt centres on human-controlled robot machines\n\nThe name was originally Gundam - a combination of \"gun\" and \"freedom\"\n\nIt first launched as an animated TV series in 1979\n\nModel kits of the robots, called Gunpla, are produced by Bandai\n\nSince 1980, Bandai has sold hundreds of millions of kits, across thousands of models\n\nShana Schwartz, whose \"nerdy\" encounter led to marriage and three children, and Twitter user @OnlyJepp, whose husband impressed her with a homemade stormtrooper from Star Wars, are just some of the people sharing their stories following Elle's tweet.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @shanaschwarz I made a nerdy connection with a boy in a chatroom in 1998.
