Photo: RADiUS-TWC\n\nHalloween is less than a week away. Scary! It\u2019s hard to imagine celebrating Halloween when the entire world already feels like Halloween, but I have an idea about how to fix this. Remember how we fixed ALS when we did the Ice Bucket Challenge? Or how we fixed human evolution with the Tide Pod Challenge? Or how we raised awareness for mannequins with the Mannequin Challenge? What if \u2014 hear me out \u2014 we invented a new viral challenge, one that would make everyone feel happy again by reminding us that things could be much worse \u2014 that we could instead be relentlessly stalked by undead sex demons hell-bent on yanking our legs into unnatural positions?\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about the It Follows Challenge (#ItFollowsChallenge). The It Follows Challenge is not actually a thing \u2026 yet. I have been trying to make it a thing for approximately one calendar year, and so far it hasn\u2019t worked, possibly because it is TOO spooky. But I feel strongly that it should work, for the health of the globe, so I am writing this blog. Below, I\u2019ll answer your inevitable questions about the It Follows Challenge, which one person told me seemed \u201cso random.\u201d\n\n\u2026 What?\n\nThe #ItFollowsChallenge is inspired by David Robert Mitchell\u2019s 2014 feature film It Follows, starring Maika Monroe as a woman who is followed (hence the title) around her suburban town by a mysterious force that takes on a variety of human forms and violently kills people. The only way to get the evil entity off your back is to have sex with somebody, who is then \u201cfollowed\u201d in your stead. As I have said before, horror movies are now officially preferable to real life, so why not make your life more like a horror movie?\n\nThis movie came out five years ago, not even to the day. Like, literally even in a different season than we\u2019re in now? Right?\n\nYeah.\n\nIs there a sequel coming out?\n\nNo.\n\nSo does this have to do with anything in particular?\n\nIt does not.\n\nSo why are we doing it?\n\nI feel like I explained that pretty well.\n\nOkay. How do you do the #ItFollowsChallenge?\n\nFind a friend, or even a fun-looking stranger who looks like they appreciate a nice laugh. Ask that friend or stranger to walk really far away from you (roughly one city block) and then stalk towards you, very slowly and expressionless. In the background you should play the theme music from It Follows. If you can do the whole thing without either of you laughing, you win the challenge. Watch the video above for more information.\n\nBut you\u2019re laughing in that video.\n\nRight, I failed. I am not a role model, just a vessel.\n\nHow do I make sure that the #ItFollowsChallenge is a major viral success? This is important to me.\n\nI agree. Just tag your video #ItFollowsChallenge and we will make this a major viral success.
