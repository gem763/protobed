REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\n\nThe All Blacks said on Tuesday that Savea would wear the goggles in his side\u2019s World Cup Pool B match against Canada in Oita after having suffered blurred vision in his left eye for about two years.\n\nSavea sought advice from All Blacks doctor Tony Page who found some World Rugby-approved goggles that the loose forward will wear them for the first time in a match off the bench against Canada at Oita stadium.\n\nBarrett, who is starting at fullback for the All Blacks, said he had been unaware of Savea\u2019s eyesight issues, despite having spent six years with him at the Wellington Hurricanes.\n\n\u201cIt did come as a bit of a surprise to us, because he never complained about it before,\u201d Barrett told reporters ahead of the team\u2019s final training run.\n\n\u201cBut it does makes sense. At certain training sessions or in games he would be blinking more than usual. I can remember other scenarios where it does just make sense.\u201d\n\nAssistant coach Ian Foster also said he knew little about Savea\u2019s difficulties beforehand and was unsure if he had worn corrective lenses previously.\n\nHe thought the goggles were purely protective.\n\n\u201cHe has had a lack of vision in one eye for a while and he just needs them for protection,\u201d Foster said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know too much about the glasses. All I know is that they\u2019re approved by World Rugby and that other players have worn them before.\u201d\n\nThe decision to wear the goggles came after the 25-year-old noticed deterioration in the vision of his left eye two years ago and he went to Page about the issue.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s kind of blurry,\u201d Savea said in a statement. \u201cI told ... Tony ... that it was getting worse and now we\u2019re doing something about it.\n\n\u201cIn terms of vision and seeing, it\u2019s pretty sweet, and it\u2019s now just a matter of getting used to them.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby approved the use of protective goggles in May this year.\n\nRugby Union - New Zealand Training - The Lensbury, London, Britain - November 6, 2018 New Zealand's Ardie Savea during training Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra\n\nItaly flyhalf Ian McKinley wore protective goggles after he went blind in one eye in 2011.\n\nHe initially retired from rugby but took up the game again in 2014, while playing for a lower level club in Italy before he moved up the ranks and was eventually called into the Italian national squad by Conor O\u2019Shea.\n\nMcKinley has played nine tests for Italy since his debut in 2017, including against his native country Ireland in August, but did not make the World Cup squad.", "description": "The fact that the eyesight of All Blacks flanker Ardie Savea had deteriorated so much he needed to wear protective goggles during matches came as a surprise to long-time team mate Beauden Barrett.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435713202&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901S7", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
