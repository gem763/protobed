Barclays said letters sent in by Mail readers had helped sway the decision.\n\nThe pressure on bosses had grown into a firestorm in the two weeks since the Mail launched our campaign against the \u2018petty, penny-pinching\u2019 decision designed to save \u00a37million a year [File photo]\n\nCustomers who helped lead the fightback yesterday spoke of their relief.\n\nRetired teacher Anne Wood, 86, of Mudeford, Dorset, who faced expensive taxi rides to get cash out, said: \u2018I\u2019d been really worried, trying to think of other ways to manage. The news has made my day, and it lifted a big weight from my shoulders. It is all down to the Daily Mail\u2019s campaign.\u2019\n\nSylvia Walton, 91, a Barclays customer of 75 years, of Elmswell, Suffolk, said: \u2018I have two artificial hips and two artificial knees. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done if I needed to drive five miles on an icy day in January.\u2019\n\nBarclays customers yesterday said a \u2018weight had been lifted from their shoulders\u2019 after bosses dramatically reversed their decision to ban cash withdrawals at post offices [File photo]\n\nMark Sims, 59, had faced a 28-mile trip to his nearest branch if the bank had stopped him from taking cash out at his post office in Holbeton, Devon.\n\nHe said: \u2018I am delighted. Finally common sense prevails. Well done to the Daily Mail for pushing the matter this far. I doubt Barclays would have reversed the decision without it.\u2019\n\nThe pressure on bosses had grown into a firestorm in the two weeks since the Mail launched our campaign against the \u2018petty, penny-pinching\u2019 decision designed to save \u00a37million a year.\n\nBarclays will now continue to allow customers to deposit and withdraw cash, check balances and pay cheques in through the UK\u2019s 11,500 post office branches.\n\nYesterday chief executive Jes Staley said: \u2018We believed we were making the correct decision. These things are difficult. Markets are facing a move from paper to digital and we all need to recognise that, but at the same time we recognise the important role the Post Office plays.\u2019", "description": "The pressure on bosses had grown into a firestorm in the two weeks since the Mail launched our campaign against the 'petty, penny-pinching' decision designed to save \u00a37million a year.", "authors": ["Tom Witherow", "Amelia Murray", "Miles Dilworth For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/19710366-0-image-a-2_1572043913790.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
