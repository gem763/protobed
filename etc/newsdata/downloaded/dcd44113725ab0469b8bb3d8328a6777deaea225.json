A Royal Commission that was set up in 2012 amid growing anger over the secretive policy, blamed unnamed \u201ccorrupt officials\u201d for the surge.\n\nThe programme came to be known as Project IC or Project M amid allegations that Mahathir, who was prime minister from 1981 to 2003, used the scheme to help the then-ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) expand into the Borneo state.\n\nMalaysia's Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak have their own distinctive histories and large populations of indigenous people who are often Christian or animist. [Bazuki Muhammad/Reuters]\n\nImmigration\n\nMahathir himself quit UMNO in 2016 and returned to power in May 2018 at the head of Pakatan Harapan, the opposition grouping that rode a wave of popular discontent over large-scale corruption to sweep UMNO and its coalition partners from office.\n\nAmid the rumblings in Borneo, the previous administration set up a federal committee at the end of 2017 to look into relations across the South China Sea, but there has been little progress.\n\n\u201cThere are real tensions,\u201d James Chin, the director of Asia Institute Tasmania at the University of Tasmania and an expert on Malaysian politics, told Al Jazeera.\n\nOver the past year, Pakatan has tried to deliver on some of its manifesto promises including a constitutional amendment tabled to honour the Malaysia Agreement and recognise Sabah and Sarawak as founding members of Malaysia, which were then stymied by Sarawak opposition MPs. The state administration is aligned with the previous UMNO-led coalition.\n\nBut other moves have undermined trust, including an announcement earlier this month of 600,000 Sabah Temporary Passes for foreign nationals.\n\nJeffrey Kitingan, a Sabah state assemblyman for the opposition STAR Party and a veteran of the fight for autonomy, remains deeply suspicious.\n\nIs the government\u2019s plan to \u201ceventually drown the indigenous peoples of Sabah under the majority power of the new immigrants?\u201d he asked.\n\nFight for resources\n\nThe differences are also economic.\n\nThe two states have vast natural resources from timber to oil and gas - Sarawak accounts for more than a quarter of Malaysia\u2019s entire reserves - but remain far poorer than most states in the peninsula.\n\nMillions - perhaps billions - has reportedly been lost to corruption - defeated Sabah Chief Minister Musa Aman will go on trial in June next year, while former Sarawak Chief Minister-turned-octogenarian governor Taib Mahmud is under federal investigation.\n\nBut the states say they should also be getting a fairer share of the money from resources that has gone to the federal government when national oil company Petronas was established in 1974.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to restore to Sarawak\u2019s rights that are enshrined in the Malaysia Agreement,\u201d the chief minister said during a state assembly sitting last August.\n\nThe movement for increased autonomy and respect within Malaysia remains in its infancy, but it has given the people of Sabah and Sarawak the opportunity to assert their voice and grab the central government\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cNobody flies a Malaysian flag here any more,\u201d Jaban told Al Jazeera. \u201cIn the past, people were scared - now, it\u2019s time that we speak out and dare.\u201d", "description": "Sabah and Sarawak are pushing for autonomy and equal status they say were part of agreement to create Malaysia in 1963.", "authors": ["Tom Danks"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/ef7270542ecc4e98917e6b073e553f24_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
