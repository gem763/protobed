Audrey asked Philip to create a conditioner that would suit her fine hair without weighing it down. He formulated Elasticizer, she loved it and requested pots be sent to her home in Switzerland. Since its launch in 1974, Elasticizer has won more than 100 prestigious awards.\n\nThis hair mask is actually a pre-shampoo treatment and, as Anabel Kingsley, director of communications and trichologist at the brand, explains, the \"elasticizer plumps the hair shaft with moisture, leaving strands stronger and bouncier. Leave a pre-shampoo conditioner on for at least 20 minutes, preferably an hour, and then shampoo and condition as usual.\"\n\nWe did just that, but it is a bit awkward if you wash your hair in the morning and are short on time. So we also tried leaving it on overnight and sleeping on a towel, which worked perfectly and is great for severely dried-out, damaged hair. When we tested it overnight, we did find we had to double shampoo fine hair in the morning to remove it all. Anabel recommends using it once or twice a week and we found after just a couple of weeks, hair was significantly shinier and felt more elastic and supple.\n\nFinding the balance between leaving hair nourished and moisturised and crossing the line into limp territory, is tricky if your hair is fine. But we found this was the best we tested for not leaving fine hair lacklustre or lifeless. It also comes in an Extreme version if you do have thick, curly, coarse, or very porous or processed hair.\n\nBuy now\n\nAveda dry remedy moisturizing masque, 150ml: \u00a330, Aveda\n\nThe hair hero ingredient responsible for rescuing parched brittle hair in this mask is Buriti Oil, one of nature\u2019s most powerful hydrators. The oil is harvested from the fruit of the moriche palm, which flourishes in Brazil\u2019s wettest areas. If your locks suffer with feeling rough, we found this delivers some serious softness after just one use. It saturates the hair with intense moisture, but doesn\u2019t leave finer hair limp. And the gorgeous floral scent is the iconic Aveda blend comprising organic lavender, bergamot and ginger lily. Aside from Aveada\u2019s holistic approach to beauty using pure flower and plant essences it is a pioneer when it comes to sustainability. For this mask it's combined post consumer recycled (PCR) and bioplastic packaging \u2013 the bioplastic is made primarily from sugarcane ethanol, which is a renewable sustainable resource.\n\nBuy now\n\n3 More Inches lifesaver hair mask, 500ml: \u00a335, Must Have\n\nThis mask is a real game-changer if you\u2019re trying to grow your hair or struggling to keep the ends of your hair in great condition. It\u2019s a pre-wash treatment and should be left on dry hair for 45 minutes \u2013 you need to really soak the hair and coat and comb every strand. Then rinse really well once and follow with a conditioner to seal and protect the cuticle. If time is not on your side, you can leave it on overnight, or apply before you leave home when you know you\u2019re going to be washing your hair (gym class, swimming, salon blow dry etc). Or even on holiday, apply in the morning for protection and then shampoo and condition after swimming. High concentration cashmere proteins are the life-saving ingredients here and they\u2019re almost identical to the molecular size and shape of human hair, so can penetrate deeply and repair broken bonds in the hair shaft \u2013 which is what causes thinning and breakage. With regular use you can expect thicker, smoother hair with more swing and shine. We tested it for just a few weeks and found it definitely started to deliver results.\n\nBuy now\n\nRedken color extend blondage express anti-brass, 250ml: \u00a318.49, Look Fantastic\n\nFor anyone with highlights, this should without a doubt be your go-to mask for shiny bright blonde. Of all the purple hair products we\u2019ve tested and it\u2019s a lot, Redken Blondage is the absolute best for keeping brassy blonde at bay. If cooler, brighter blonde is your holy grail, this colour depositing mask only takes five minutes to neutralise and correct unwanted warmer tones and add much needed nourishment to bleached hair. We found you do need to wear gloves (or rinse immediately!) with this mask as it can stain skin and nails a pale lilac colour and we tried to avoid the scalp where possible for the same reason. During testing, we found six minutes did the job perfectly, but you can leave it on for up to 10 minutes if your blonde is really warm. It leaves hair silky smooth and nourished and no yellow tones in sight.\n\nBuy now\n\nKerastase nutritive masquintense, 200ml: \u00a321.80, All Beauty\n\nIf you struggle to find a mask that doesn\u2019t weigh down limp locks, or alternatively has enough oomph to really inject some moisture into coarser hair, then this cult classic is worth a look as it comes in two options \u2013 one for thick hair and one for fine. Incredibly concentrated, you don\u2019t need very much product at all to get good results so the pot lasted ages. We tested the fine hair option and impressively it really does manage to deliver moisture to the hair shaft, but without leaving any weight at all. Hair looked shinier and glossier after a few weeks\u2019 use. Only use this on the mid lengths and ends though, because we found when applied very near the scalp it\u2019s too much for fine hair roots that like to lie flat to the head at the best of times. Masquintense is a long-term solution for dry damaged hair, as it works on improving and boosting the nutrition that goes directly into the hair fibre. Results aren\u2019t instant, but we found hair really improved over time.\n\nBuy now\n\nIGK antisocial overnight bond building dry hair mask, 187ml: \u00a330, Space NK\n\nAn overnight hair mask that doesn\u2019t need to be washed in the morning?
