REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez/Files\n\nThe release under a good behaviour reward programme of more than 1,700 criminals guilty of dangerous offences has been a huge embarrassment for a crime-busting former mayor who was elected almost entirely on promises to make the streets safer.\n\nDuterte said there was a \u201cprize\u201d of a million pesos ($19,175) for each of the former felons still at large, after less than 700 of them heeded his call for their surrender.\n\n\u201cThe one million prize is available to those who can capture them dead or alive. But maybe dead would be a better option. I will pay you smiling,\u201d he told reporters late on Tuesday.\n\nDuterte is a former prosecutor notorious for a deadly war on drugs that has caused international alarm, and countless urban legends of his gangster-style approach to fighting criminal enemies during his 22 years as mayor of Davao City.\n\nHis latest remarks are likely to outrage opponents who accuse him of deliberately using rhetoric that incites vigilantism. His office rejects that and says his tough talk is endearing to millions of Filipinos.\n\nThe good conduct law was passed under Duterte\u2019s predecessor to try to reduce the populations of some of the world\u2019s most crowded jails.\n\nMore than 21,000 inmates were released, but justice ministry officials say more than 2,000 of them were sentenced for crimes, like rape, drugs, murder, bribery, plunder, kidnapping and arson, and therefore they were not eligible for release.\n\nSome 1,700 of them were freed by a corrections bureau run by Duterte\u2019s appointees, two of them his staunch loyalists. The most recent, Nicanor Faeldon, was sacked this month after it emerged that nearly 900 serious offenders were freed on his watch. Faeldon denies wrongdoing.\n\nDuterte defended the appointment on Tuesday of a new corrections bureau boss - a prison chief for whom prosecutors have sought homicide charges.\n\nGerald Bantag ran a jail in Manila\u2019s Paranaque City, where in 2016, a grenade explosion killed 10 inmates, most of them drug offenders. A court has yet to take up the case.\n\nDuterte said he believed Bantag was the right choice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that he did it. If he did, then he might be convicted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut in the meantime, I like him because I heard he throws grenades,\u201d he added, nonchalantly.", "description": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has renewed an offer of big bounties for hundreds of convicted murderers and rapists set free in a corrections bureau blunder, and said he would be happier if they were caught dead rather than alive.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431098011&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0AJ", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
