but no matter how realistic, it is impossible to break through the facial payment system\", the company said on its Weibo account.\n\nEven before the system attempts to match the face, it detects whether the presented image is a still, video or software simulation.\n\n\"This avoids fraud caused by face-changing technology,\" Alibaba said.\n\nMomo also moved to calm fears Zao could be used for fraud, clarifying Alipay's point it only used and adapted still photographs for its deepfake videos.\n\n\"The facial payment security threshold is extremely high, and 'face-changing' technology realised by only one photo can't break through the security system,\" the developers said.\n\nIt was \"completely impossible\" for deepfakes of this kind to threaten payment security, Momo told The Paper.\n\nAnd last year, academic Pan Helin told China Daily Alipay's facial recognition was \"theoretically a more secure and convenient method than the conventional use of passwords\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Alipay is the world's largest mobile payment system\n\nWhat's the reaction been?\n\nConcerns over the app reached state-run Chinese press.\n\nGlobal Times said it was another example of \"concerning\" AI-powered apps \"which could be used maliciously\".\n\nChina was already considering tightening regulations governing AI face-stitching technology, the paper said.\n\nAnd lawyer Zhang Xinnian told it the laws governing phone apps' terms and conditions needed to be tightened.\n\nZao's initial terms \"violated user privacy and once personal information is leaked and abused it could lead to criminal incidents\", he added.\n\nMeanwhile, law professor Zhu Wei told state news agency Xinhua: \"People are using a mobile client that involves information about personal identity, property, scan codes and mobile payments and they can't see exactly what information is obtained by the app, so it is very dangerous.\"\n\nImage copyright MOMO Image caption Zao topped the app chart in China almost immediately after its release\n\nA commentary in the Beijing News even asked whether the app could become \"a threat to national security\".\n\nWith genuine concerns about national and personal security from Zao and future deepfake services, \"it is necessary to regulate them as soon as possible with clear legal provisions\", it added.\n\nA Guangzhou Daily editorial said: \"Changing-face videos is fun but the potential security risks cannot be ignored.\"\n\nAnd The Paper said while Zao's popularity would be short-lived, its arrival had made it easier for dark actors to take advantage of face-changing technology.\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
