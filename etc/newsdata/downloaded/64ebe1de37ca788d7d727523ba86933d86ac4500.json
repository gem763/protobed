Because these people have no homes, they have nowhere to properly dump the sewage that accumulates in their vehicles. Instead, the waste gets dumped directly into storm drains that connect to waterways. Two business groups in the city have funded testing related to the dumping and reached some stunning results:\n\nUsing Environmental Protection Agency wastewater pump-out and treatment statistics, it\u2019s estimated that Seattle RV campers likely discharge more than 1 million gallons of untreated sewage annually into our waterways, including the Duwamish Waterway and Salmon Bay\u2026 To better understand the potential impact of RV discharges, the Sodo Business Improvement Area and Ballard Alliance commissioned Anchor QEA, a Seattle-based environmental science and engineering firm, to evaluate existing water-quality data and collect a storm drain water sample from a heavily populated RV parking area in Sodo. The sample from the storm drain in the midst of the RVs registered 300 times greater than the state water-quality standard for fecal coliform bacteria\u2026 While a more definitive pollution-identification study is needed on the relative impact of illegal black-water discharges, the data points strongly suggest that illegal dumping of sewage and trash, along with unsanitary conditions in unregulated RV encampments, increase public-health risks and could result in serious outbreaks of communicable diseases such as hepatitis A and typhus.\n\nThe business groups that funded the testing have shared the results with the city and are now calling on city leaders to act: \u201cIt is time to stop ignoring the impacts of unregulated RV encampments and illegal raw-sewage dumping.\u201d\n\nSeattle created a \u201csafe lot\u201d for homeless people living in RVs back in 2016, but it was eventually abandoned because of the cost:\n\nResponding to concerns about a growing number of vehicles parked for weeks and months in Fremont, Ballard, Magnolia and other neighborhoods, Murray in January issued and the City Council approved an emergency order to quickly open a pair of safe lots for the homeless \u2014 one in Ballard and one in Delridge. The Ballard lot opened last month, but was at capacity with 20 vehicles as of March 15 and is costing the city about $35,000 per month \u2014 $1,750 per vehicle, Murray spokesman Viet Shelton said. That\u2019s the same as median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Seattle, according to Zillow\u2019s latest estimate.\n\nA new \u201csafe lot\u201d has been proposed recently but once again the projected cost is sky-high:\n\nThis being Seattle, it\u2019s projected to cost the city $382,000. That\u2019s for overnight parking in one lot in the U District, holding 20 to 30 cars. Which means each spot would cost $1,000 to $1,500 a month \u2013 in the ballpark of what it costs to rent a studio apartment. \u201cI heard about that budget, and it just boggles the mind,\u201d said Karina O\u2019Malley, who manages a homelessness parking program for a church in Kirkland at less than one-thirtieth the cost. \u201cThis stuff is not rocket science. What is the deal with Seattle?\u201d\n\nThings haven\u2019t improved at all since I wrote about an RV that crashed into a local business last year. I think what\u2019s going on here is that businesses have realized the city isn\u2019t going to respond to their pleas to do something about the RV campers and the problems they bring with them. On the contrary, the city has made it extremely easy for campers to continue doing what they are doing.\n\nThe Seattle City Council will deliberate Tuesday how to address the growing amount of unsafe RVs on Seattle streets. \u201cIt\u2019s really a public health issue,\u201d said Councilmember Sally Bagshaw. \u201cThe main goal is we\u2019re taking care of the people inside these RVs.\u201d\u2026 Most notably, in the proposed ordinance, those living in RVs can refuse to leave or move their RVs if they feel it would jeopardize their safety. \u201cInitiating or continuing an investigation into the potential violation of Section 11.75.020 shall not occur if there is an explicit objection from the person allowed to occupy the motor vehicle that is deemed to be extensively damaged if such enforcement would increase the occupant\u2019s vulnerability or exposure to unsafe living conditions.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the homeless in these RVs can just tell the city to go away.\n\nInstead of continuing to fight a battle the city\u2019s elected leaders don\u2019t care about, it seems the business groups are trying to focus the city\u2019s attention on something it will care about, in this case that\u2019s the environment. Maybe a few of the left-wing city council members will decide this is now a problem that deserves their attention and do something about it.", "description": "\"illegal dumping of sewage and trash...increase public-health risks...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/seattle-RV.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
