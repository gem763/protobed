On analysis of the different sectors of Nifty, Nifty PSU Banks showed strong sell off on September 19th, 2019. Although, a plethora of boosting measures have been provided by the India's Finance Minister, but the absence of execution methodology of boosting financial package is still unclear; which looks evident enough to attract FIIs and DIIs to trigger sell offs on every upward move.\n\nOn the other hand, Nifty Auto seems to be struggling amid unresolved GST issue; which not only needs immediate attention; but also now mingled with new traffic rules which propeled transporters to called symbolic strike on September 19th, 2019 against steep hike in fuel prices since July 5th , 2019. Secondly, sell off triggered on September 19th, 2019 in almost all the sectors of Nifty 50 looks evident enough to reflect the growing weakness in Nifty 50; which is likely to continue for some more time because Nifty looks to have been pushed in bearish territory.\n\nI find that the steady Gold and Crude, once again look ready to propel the fear of global economic slowdown; as the prospects of looming recession led U.S. equity markets to test their record lows on September 18th, 2019. I find that this fall defines a lot not only for further directional moves of U.S. equity markets, but also for the Indian equity markets; which still facing weakness during the month of September.

On the other hand, if the Nifty 50 opens with one more gap-down, sell off would likely to follow till the weekly closing; but a gap-up opening will also encourage the bears to come forward to sell every upward move in Nifty 50; amid growing volatility overall trend still looks bearish.\n\nNifty 50 - Daily Chart\n\nNifty 50 - 4 Hr.
