The Department will release an updated table once finalised,\" a statement said.\n\n\"To be clear, there have been no underestimates or budget overruns for the Future Submarine or Hunter Class programs. These programs will be funded through a series of progressive government approvals \u2013 all which are provisioned within the Defence Integrated Investment Program.\n\n\"As at 30 June 2019, expenditure on Future Submarine design and construction was $834.6 million, which included the cost of design work, the science and technology program, and operational costs.\"\n\nUnwanted distraction\n\nOpposition assistant defence minister Pat Conroy said public confidence in the government's handling of the submarine project was being undermined.\n\n\u201cThe Future Submarine project is already running 10 years late and is cloaked in secrecy. The fact that Defence can\u2019t even manage to accurately report on a $3.7 billion increase in the project\u2019s budget is of real concern,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFurthermore, to find out about a quadrupling of the project budget through an appendix to an annual report demonstrates that this project lacks adequate transparency.\"\n\nWhile minor, the gaffe is another unwanted distraction for what is billed as Australia's most complex and expensive public works project.\n\nThe error in the report emerged on the eve for Senate estimates, where senior Defence officials were already facing a grilling over complaints Australian suppliers risked missing out on work.\n\nThere is also speculation the project may be running up to 18 months behind schedule, with major contracts with suppliers being signed only now, much later than envisaged.\n\nDefence faces another headache with the submarine program with an interstate stoush over the potential relocation of deep maintenance operations for the Collins class submarine.\n\nWhile Western Australia has made a strong bid to secure full-cycle dockings of the Collins class submarines \u2013 which see the boats taken out of the water for two years and cut open to undergo a significant overhaul \u2013 South Australia is resisting any move to shift the work.\n\nKey Senator Rex Patrick has threatened the Morrison government that any move to shift full-cycle dockings, and the hundreds of jobs at ASC that go with it, would jeopardise Centre Alliance support for legislation.", "description": "Defence has denied it has underestimated the cost of the new submarine project, blaming a typo for the mistake.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2942%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dee9504c31d5f964a16d0601e1060ad237a34501", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
