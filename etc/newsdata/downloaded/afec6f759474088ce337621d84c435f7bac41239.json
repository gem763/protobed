Clearly, you shouldn't own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else. pic.twitter.com/jsiZmwjMDs \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 13, 2019\n\n\"You\u2019re a child Robert Francis,\" Cain replied.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s given name is Robert Francis. It was also the given name of Bobby Kennedy, the Democratic presidential candidate who was shot to death while campaigning in 1968.\n\nThe original tweet was removed by Twitter for violating the social media platform\u2019s \u201cviolent threat\u201d policy.\n\nAn official with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told CNN that the message was reported to the FBI.\n\nFollowing the mass shooting in El Paso last month, O'Rourke returned to his hometown to offer support to victims. He returned to the campaign trail with a focus on gun control.\n\nCain is something of a notorious figure in Texas politics. According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he was booted from the state Democratic convention in 2018 for trying to distribute fake gun-control signs after brandishing what appeared to be a sidearm.\n\nRead more debate coverage from Yahoo News:", "description": "Briscoe Cain, a Republican serving in the Texas House of Representatives, responded to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call for a ban on assault weapons during Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate with a tweet that read: \u201cMy AR is ready for you Robert Francis.\u201d", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JQF_w6zSQtiKjrlzzew9AA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d443a2e0-d5da-11e9-b7f7-1efa06d997a4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
