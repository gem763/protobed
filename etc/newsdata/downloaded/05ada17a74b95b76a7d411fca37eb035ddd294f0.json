Have a bit of a laugh and close it down.\n\n\"People are self publishing. Most people don't know how to write.\"\n\nIn defence of Shirley, Craig backed his co-star's final decision to send Catherine Tyldesley home from the competition.\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX)\n\nIt's no surprise he was delighted with the decision as he had chosen to save Katya Jones and Mike Bushell in the dance off.\n\nCraig made a vicious dig at former contestant Ann Widdcombe as he pointed out she wasn't the \"best dancer\" yet she managed to sail through to week 11.\n\nThe Strictly star called the public out for not filing their votes.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe added: \"Yeah I was [happy with the result]. The public weren't. I just say vote, you must vote. The public have 50% of the vote, not just four of us.\n\n\"We look professionally who is a better person, whether it be technical, entertainment value, anything like that.\n\n\"The audience at home have a chance to change the leaderboard entirely. Ann Widdcombe got to week 11 and she wasn't the best dancer. That's got to be considered.\"\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues this Saturday.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Craig Revel Horwood lashed out at trolls after Shirley Ballas was bombarded with death threats", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror", "David Fisher Rex", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745419.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ASP_MDM_281019_POB_116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
