And, until this correction and adjustment has been sorted \u2014 which I think it will be, but it might take a bit of time \u2014 you are going to get these concerns,\" Clark said.\n\n\"As far as we are concerned, we are not insulated to it, but we are armed mentally to deal with that kind of situation.\"\n\nThe dispute between the U.S. and China has dragged on for well over a year, battering financial markets and souring business and consumer sentiment.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed high-level trade talks between both sides would take place next month.\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said negotiators from the U.S. and China had made some progress in last week's deputy-level meetings.", "description": "Emirates Airline President Tim Clark believes the Dubai-based carrier will eventually overcome concerns about a global economic downturn.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106145771-1569325467124gettyimages-1166058358.jpeg?v=1569325550", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
