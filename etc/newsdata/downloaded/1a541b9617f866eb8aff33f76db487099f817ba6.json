On the whole, this is excellent news. If we\u2019re going to read Lessing, we might as well go for the big one: the 1962 novel regarded as her masterpiece and described in The Oxford Companion to English Literature as \u201cone of the key texts of the women\u2019s movement in the 1960s\u201d.\n\nThe only possible reason for hesitation is that this world-shaker is also challenging. It\u2019s long and involved and features far more mid-20th-century Marxism than most modern readers are used to. But that should also make coming to terms with this book all the more fascinating.\n\nLessing herself composed a handy guide to reading The Golden Notebook. In 1971, when the novel was approaching its 10th anniversary, she wrote an amusingly bad-tempered preface berating those she thought had misunderstood it.\n\n\u201cThe shape of this novel is as follows,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere is a skeleton, or frame, called Free Women, which is a conventional short novel, about 60,000 words, and which could stand by itself. But it is divided into five sections and separated by stages of the four notebooks, black, red, yellow and blue. The notebooks are kept by Anna Wulf, a central character of Free Women. She keeps four, and not one, because as she recognizes, she has to separate things off from each other, out of fear of chaos, of formlessness, of breakdown.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times later explained:\n\nShe considered the novel to be a triumph of structure. By fragmenting the story, she said, she wanted to show the danger of compartmentalizing one\u2019s thinking, the idea that \u201cany kind of single-mindedness, narrowness, obsession, was bound to lead to mental disorder, if not madness.\u201d\n\nLessing also tells us what the book is not. It isn\u2019t, she writes emphatically, \u201ca trumpet for Women\u2019s Liberation\u201d. (More fool The Oxford Companion to English Literature.) She angrily complains that reviewers missed the fact that the book was about a \u201ccrack up\u201d and instead \u201cbelittled\u201d the book as an account of the \u201csex war\u201d.\n\nA sample of reviews from 1962 renders Lessing\u2019s arguments moot at best.\n\nIn The Guardian, Anne Duch\u00eane wrote: \u201cThis book is essential reading for anyone who tries to study the mechanism of the modern consciousness and see why it is such a mess.\u201d Meanwhile, in the Observer, Francis Hope said: \u201cShe is also trying to convey, directly the schizophrenia and alienation which make living and writing today difficult.\u201d\n\nErnest Buckler in the New York Times said the book is about \u201cthe transcendental spaces where the spirit soars and the terrible dark corners where it crouches at the point of \u2018crack-up\u2019 so scarifyingly described it makes Fitzgerald\u2019s similar account sound like nettle rash.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we should discount Lessing\u2019s furious preface. Like most of her writing, it is fantastically entertaining and contains some blistering one-liners. If The Golden Notebook were coming out today (1971), she writes, \u201cit might be read, and not merely reacted to\u201d.\n\nKapow! Pity the critics who were knocked down as such straw men, especially when so many of them seemed to value the book so highly. Buckler had even noted her \u201cspecial genius\u201d for observation, and said \u201ca firkinful of scorching aphorisms could be culled from nearly every page\u201d.\n\nMind you, Buckler did have one criticism that could have made Lessing more righteously angry. \u201cThe book,\u201d he said, \u201cis too long.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m all for mighty tomes by fiercely intelligent female writers and I\u2019m enjoying this one already. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll join me. I also hope that those who have already experienced this extraordinary work of art will add their thoughts as we progress through the month. This is a book that matters.\n\nThanks to Harper Perennial, we have five copies to give to the first five people from the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive suggestion in the comments section below.
