This action reflects the UAW commitment and solidarity to all of our members and their families who are taking a courageous stand together to protect our middle-class way of life.\u201d\n\nThe changes come four weeks after nearly 50,000 GM workers at 31 GM factories and 21 other facilities walked off the job after failing to reach a new union contract.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 United Auto Workers members currently on strike will receive a pay increase and the opportunity to secure part-time employment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
