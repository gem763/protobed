The headquarters for an electric company and a major bureau for a national newspaper have both been lit aflame.\n\nAD\n\nFor the first time after the end of the Pinochet regime in 1990, the government has called the military onto the streets of Santiago, the country\u2019s capital, as that city emerges from its third consecutive night of a government-imposed curfew.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are at war against a powerful enemy, willing to use violence with no limits,\u201d Chilean President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era said at a news conference late on Sunday, in comments that only seemed to spark more furor among protesters. He said protesters had only one goal: producing as much harm as possible.\n\nWhile Pi\u00f1era said on Saturday he would revert to a metro fare increase, that appears to have done little to satisfy crowds. A state of emergency declared in six cities is expected to expand around the country on Monday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis was an economic pressure cooker that\u2019s been building for decades, and it exploded,\u201d Rodrigo Booth, a professor at the University of Chile, said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cThis had little to do with public transit. It became a situation about brutal inequality.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOver the past three decades, Chile\u2019s neoliberal policies have made it one of South America\u2019s wealthiest countries, with inflation under control and easy access to credit.\n\nBut those policies have also created stark economic disparities and strapped many Chileans into debt. Many basic utilities, from water to highways and the current pension system, have been privatized.\n\nAD\n\nThat extends to Santiago\u2019s metro, a modern transit system that\u2019s the largest in South America and a point of pride for many Chileans. But repeat fare increases have jumped far ahead of wages, critics say, such that a family making minimum wage would have been forced to use one-sixth of their income on transportation alone.\n\nSince last week, hundreds of students flooded into several stations around Santiago to hop turnstiles in protest of the fare increase. The hike raised subway tickets from the equivalent of $1.12 to about $1.16, a record high in the region. By late last week, mobs of young people were destroying stations and leaving graffiti behind.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Chilean people are protesting in a way that\u2019s so spontaneous and potent means we have to seriously consider that there\u2019s a deep wound that hasn\u2019t healed, not even been discussed, in these past few decades,\u201d Amal\u00e1 Saint-Pierre Aguad\u00e9, a theater producer in Santiago, said in an interview with The Post.\n\nAD\n\nThe country\u2019s constitution, she noted, has remained the same since the Pinochet regime.\n\nCIENTOS DE ESTUDIANTES VUELVEN A TOMARSE LAS ESTACIONES DE METRO EN SANTIAGO DE CHILE PARA QUE LOS USUARIOS VIAJEN GRATIS TRAS EL ALZA DEL PASAJE QUE SUPERA 1 D\u00d3LAR, UNO DE LOS TRANSPORTES M\u00c1S CAROS DE LA REGI\u00d3N.

Augusto Pinochet \u2014 a 17-year-period when dissidents were imprisoned, tortured, and in many cases, \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2014 and younger Chileans, who were born after its end and who have taken to the streets with far less abandon.\n\nAs subway service was suspended Friday and Pi\u00f1era imposed a curfew on Santiago, things only seemed to escalate. Over the weekend, his government dispatched 3,000 members of the military and 5,000 members of the national police force to quell demonstrations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVideos on social media showed military officers yelling, as protesters waved signs showing photos of those who disappeared during the Pinochet dictatorship. Prominent Chileans have taken to the streets too, with one well-known actress getting shot in the face on Friday with rubber pellets. That night, Pi\u00f1era was photographed having dinner at a pricey restaurant away from the crowds.\n\nConfrontations with tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets continued through the weekend. By Sunday, Chilean Interior Minister Andr\u00e9s Chadwick, said that 62 police officers and 11 civilians had been injured in the latest clashes, while nearly 1,500 people had been arrested.\n\nBooth, the University of Chile professor, said the situation was encapsulated in a scene he saw Sunday in the city\u2019s central Plaza Baquedano, where public buses stopped moving as they reached dense crowds on the streets, clouded in tear gas. He went to go participate by banging on a pot \u2014 a traditional form of protest across Latin America known as a \u201ccacerolazo\u201d \u2014 and armed himself with lemon wedges to fight the effects of tear gas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWithin minutes, he had dispensed his wedges to pedestrians who were getting off the bus or otherwise needed to walk through the square to get home: a mother with her son, about 8 years old, an elderly woman and a young couple with a toddler who had burst into tears.\n\nChile\u2019s protests follow weeks of political unrest in many other Latin American countries, with Ecuador, Peru and Honduras all erupting into demonstrations protesting stagnant economies and ineffective governments.\n\nSaint-Pierre Aguad\u00e9 said it represents a kind of \u201cLatin American spring,\" like the protests that took over the Arab world starting in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe government is blind to believe that it\u2019s happening only because of the fare increases,\u201d she said. \"They\u2019re not seeing is that this is not just because of one policy. It\u2019s the fault of every government we\u2019ve had, from the left and the right.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Demonstrations against a 42-cent transit fare hike have erupted into violent clashes over economic inequalities that many say have long been brewing in Chile.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tBXMR_2M0gmVPkAgtkbMspbXmqc=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/5dad6cee46e0fb0009826905/2019-10-21T082441Z_1_OVB21PL63_RTRMADC_0_CHILE-PROTESTS-UPDATE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
