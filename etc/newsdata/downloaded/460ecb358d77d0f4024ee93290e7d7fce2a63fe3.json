Harry Styles - Lights Up\n\nThe pressure was on. It had been two years since Harry Styles had released new music and we were desperate for anything new from the former boy bander.\n\nThen we heard that he was filming a new music video - which he told people was a mayonnaise advert \u2013 and our hearts were in our throats. Then he delivered the finished product last week \u2013 on National Coming Out Day - and it was a sultry, sweaty dream of a summer anthem. It's a soft rock piece with a catchy chorus. We're not the only ones who love it.\n\nThe Guardian's Laura Snape writes: \"Lights Up, his excellent comeback single \u2013 presumably the first from his forthcoming second album \u2013 is another open door.\"\n\nLISTEN TO LIGHTS UP HERE:\n\n2. Die Melktert Kommissie - Irrelevant\n\nThe new song from the reunited Afrikaans band is simple in its production and delivers a profound message about the flawed nature of human communication. Its classic structure provides an opportunity for the emotive nature of the lyrics to build to a chorus that is so easy to sing along to, you might not even realise doing it until days later. The new song was released last week, and you can watch it live at the band's upcoming shows. Die Melktert Kommissie's next show is on 26 October at Stoepstories, Secunda. Check out the band's upcoming gigs here.\n\nLISTEN TO IRRELEVANT HERE:\n\n3. Summer Walker - Playing Games (with Bryson Tiller)\n\nSummer Walker is a 23-year-old singer from Atlanta, Georgia. Her mixtape introduced to the world titled, Last Day of Summer was released on 19 October 2018 and her debut studio album, Over It was released on 4 October 2019.\n\nHer latest single, with Bryson Tiller, is a slow-burning, melodic track about a relationship gone sour. But it won't leave you feeling bitter because it carries a sweet hope for a reunion in the lyrics that are beautifully sung by Summer who reminds us of Brandy in the 90s. This is definitely the song we would play after work with a glass of red wine and someone we're vibing with.\n\nLISTEN TO PLAYING GAMES HERE:\n\n4. Janie Bay and Early B Janie Bay - Die Heelal\n\nFor our second Afrikaans song, we are going to take in a slightly different direction. Janie Bay and Early B have delivered a song that perfectly melds two different worlds and meets somewhere in the middle but still maintains that uniquely South African song.\n\nDie Heelal features a pop beat that got us nodding our head right away but also let us know that something bigger was coming. It's all about two people who are somewhere between friendship and something more. If you're in the same situation, you'll definitely relate to that intriguing tension between valuing a friendship but wanting something more from someone.\n\nLISTEN TO HEELAL HERE:\n\n5. Camila Cabello \u2013 Easy\n\nFrom pining for a friend to being head over heels for someone that makes you feel good and \"easy to love\", Camila's new single is all about a new relationship that feels good.\n\nShe's totally smitten and not afraid to tell the world. As they say, life might be imitating art.\n\nIt's probably the sappy single you'll find on this list, but a good, honest pop song should always be celebrated.\n\nLISTEN TO EASY HERE:\n\n6. John Mayer - Carry Me Away\n\nAfter taking a year off from releasing new music, John came back with this new single last month.\n\nIt's all about wanting a new relationship to break you out of the rut you're in. The bass-heavy track is a groovy re-introduction to the singer and songwriter who demonstrates how he crafted the tune in the accompanying music video.\n\nAs John sits on his couch with his dog and collaborates with other musicians, the viewer gets a closer (albeit edited) glimpse into how he makes those songs that you either love or hate.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO FOR CARRY ME AWAY HERE:\n\n<br _moz_dirty=\"\" />\n\n7. DJ Sliqe and Kwesta - Spaan Saam\n\nOur last track comes from local beatmaker and spinner, Lutendo Kungoane also known as DJ Sliqe, who was born and raised in the South of Johannesburg according to DRUM Magazine.\n\nThe hitmaker has teamed with the characteristically raspy voice of rapper Kwesta to make a song that makes you move even if you don't want to. As SA Hip Hop writes: \"Spaan Saam is a joint suitable for any season and mood but fits summer just perfectly. \"\n\nLISTEN TO SPAAN SAAM HERE:", "description": "We've put together a list of songs you might not have known were recently released, but you'll probably love!", "authors": ["Alex Isaacs"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9328/4c72be2d19124a9fb20aa8b2d1e17729.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
