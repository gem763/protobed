Anchor from St. Paul\u2019s shipwreck identified, researchers claim", "language": "en", "text": "Researchers claim to have identified an anchor from St. Paul\u2019s shipwreck on the island of Malta.\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, the apostle was shipwrecked on the Mediterranean island during an ill-fated first-century journey to Rome.\n\n\u201cThe ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf,\u201d according to the Acts of the Apostles. \u201cOnce safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.\u201d\n\nTHE BIBLICAL TOWN OF EMMAUS, WHICH IS LINKED TO JESUS\u2019 RESURRECTION AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT, MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND\n\nActs also notes that four anchors were dropped from the ship and subsequently cut loose, enabling the ship to run aground.\n\nThe Bible Archaeology Search and Exploration (BASE) Institute believes that it has identified evidence of the shipwreck, which occurred around 60 A.D.\n\nIn a post on the organization\u2019s website, BASE says that four ancient anchors were recovered by local divers, adding that only one of the anchors has survived. \u201cThe fourth anchor was preserved as part of a deceased diver\u2019s legacy to his widow,\u201d BASE writes. The organization, which is led by Bob Cornuke, also believes that the shipwreck happened in St. Thomas Bay on Malta\u2019s southern coast, as opposed to in what is now known as St. Paul\u2019s Bay in the north of the island.\n\nISRAELI SOLDIERS DISCOVER 3,000-YEAR-OLD BIBLICAL-ERA WATCHTOWER\n\nCiting maritime charts and the Biblical description of the area where the ship ran aground, BASE believes that St. Thomas Bay \u201chas all the earmarks of a prime suspect,\u201d with regard to the wreck\u2019s location. Citing BASE, the Express reports that the four anchors found by local divers were recovered from St. Thomas Bay in the 60s.\n\n\u201cCould this, verifiably, be an anchor from Paul\u2019s ship, which lay alongside three others for nearly two thousand years until they were recovered just a few years ago?\u201d writes BASE. \u201cAs with any historical claim, the best we can do is examine the evidence in terms of probability. But the evidence for the anchors of Paul\u2019s shipwreck is virtually overwhelming.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, have said that there is a lack of evidence to support BASE\u2019s theory, and a question mark still lingers over the wreck\u2019s actual location. Another anchor marked with ancient inscriptions that was discovered off Salina on the northern coast of Malta in 2005, for example, has also been touted as possibly linked to St. Paul\u2019s shipwreck.\n\n'JESUS' FACE' UNCOVERED AT ANCIENT CHURCH IN THE ISRAELI DESERT\n\nFox News has reached out to the BASE Institute and the University of Malta with a request for comment on this story.\n\nThe Biblical era continues to reveal its secrets. In another project, archaeologists say that they may have discovered the Biblical town of Emmaus, which is linked to Jesus\u2019 resurrection and the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nHaaretz reports that archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a 2,200-year-old fortification at Kiriath-Jearim, a hill on the outskirts of Abu Ghosh, a village near Jerusalem.\n\n'SHIPS IN THE DESERT': STRANGE 2,000-YEAR-OLD GRAFFITI DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL\n\nThe fortification dates back to the Hellenistic period when ancient Greek influence in the region was strong. Tel Aviv University Professor Israel Finkelstein told Haaretz that the walls were repaired during the later period of Roman rule in the first century A.D.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nElsewhere, soldiers at a paratrooper base in Southern Israel recently uncovered a Biblical-era watchtower.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "Researchers claim to have identified an anchor from St. Paul\u2019s shipwreck on the island of Malta.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/ShipwreckPaulMaltaGetty2016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
