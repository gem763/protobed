According to Avery\u2019s attorney, Kathleen Zellner, the confession is probably a not-so-subtle ploy for publicity and cash. Nonetheless, it\u2019s generating headlines and stoking conversation across the internet.\n\nHalbach\u2019s murder has stirred media interest in Wisconsin since 2005, but global attention exploded in 2015 after film-makers released the 10-part docu-series that framed the investigation into Halbach\u2019s murder as having been mishandled by unscrupulous law enforcement officials and the subsequent legal case bobbled by an incompetent defense attorney.\n\nOn the day of her murder, Halbach visited Avery\u2019s home, where the family operated a salvage yard, to photograph a vehicle for Auto Trader Magazine. Halbach\u2019s remains were later discovered in the burn pit behind the trailer on the property.\n\nAvery was convicted of the murder alongside his then 16-year-old nephew, Brendan Dassey, who under police pressure told authorities he took part in the murder and then helped his uncle dispose of the body.\n\nAfter the series aired, 130,000 people signed a petition asking the then president, Barack Obama, to pardon Avery and Dassey.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Teresa Halbach.

DNA testing called for by the Wisconsin Innocence Project, which investigates claims of wrongful conviction, later excluded Avery as the attacker and pointed to Gregory Allen, a man who had been on law enforcement\u2019s radar all the while.\n\nAvery was exonerated in 2003 after serving 18 years of a 32-year sentence \u2013 the same year he filed a $36m lawsuit against Manitowoc county, its former sheriff, and its former district attorney for wrongful conviction and imprisonment. Local law enforcement targeted him for Halbach\u2019s murder in retaliation for filing the lawsuit, the documentary Making a Murderer suggested. Avery and Manitowoc county later settled the suit for $400,000.\n\nAudiences were also shocked by the way authorities treated Dassey.\n\nDetectives interviewed Dassey, who has limited cognitive abilities, without a lawyer present. After he confessed to detectives, Dassey appeared in the documentary to be unaware of the consequences, at one point asking the police if he would make it back to school for sixth period because he had a project due.\n\nKathleen Zellner: the Making a Murderer lawyer you want on your side Read more\n\nLegal experts have long argued that children and individuals with limited cognitive skills are especially vulnerable to falsely confessing to crimes under pressure from police.\n\nThe National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of the University of California, Irvine, University of Michigan Law School, and Michigan State University College of Law, counts 2,497 wrongful convictions nationwide since 1989, 303 of which are tied to false confessions.\n\nIn 2016 a federal appeals court tossed Dassey\u2019s confession and overturned his conviction, but a year later the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upheld the conviction and kept it intact. In 2018, the US supreme court refused to hear the case.\n\nBoth Dassey and Avery remain in prison. Avery and his attorney, Kathleen Zellner, plan to file an appeal for post-conviction relief on 14 October.\n\nZellner believes the new confession is unlikely to have any impact on the case.\n\nConfessing to the murder is Joseph Evans Jr, a Wisconsin inmate convicted in 2009 of murdering his wife who is now serving a life sentence. Evans claims to have killed Halbach in a letter sent to Zellner in September. He also shared his story with Shawn Rech, a film-maker working on a new documentary, Convicting a Murderer, whose production is unrelated to Making a Murderer and takes aim at some of the revelations of the original series.\n\nRech has told reporters he\u2019s been corresponding with Evans for the past year and a half and felt he had to pass along Evans\u2019 confession to authorities, who have yet to vet the claims.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Evans has thrown himself into Avery\u2019s case. In 2016, after the Netflix series generated global interest in the case, Evans wrote a nine-page letter to various Wisconsin media outlets in which he claimed to have heard Avery confess to the murder in detail. The claim found little traction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An excerpt from Evans\u2019s letter.\n\nThis time Evans leads his confession with a demand for $13,000 \u2013 part of the $100,000 an anonymous donor has offered as a reward for information on the case \u2013 to be deposited on his \u201cbooks\u201d, which can be used to purchase food and other items in prison.\n\nIn the letter to Zellner, Evans claims to have accidentally struck Halbach with his car.\n\n\u201cA lady stepped out in front of my vehicle and I hit her. She fell to the ground, and hitted her head on a large rock. I got out to check on her but she was unconscious, and her head was starting to bleed,\u201d Evans wrote in a letter dated 18 September. He then panicked, he wrote, and burned Halbach\u2019s body after she died of her injuries.\n\n\u201cKeep your panties on and skirt down because I\u2019m not out to screw you,\u201d Evans wrote to Zellner. \u201cThis is a deal relationship you, me, you\u2019ll win when I give all up and the full cover up story that took place and how the state and others used me to get to Steve. I\u2019m done with all that. I\u2019m jumping ship to look out for myself and my children, eight grandchildren. Your choice. I\u2019m already set. Now, it\u2019s up to you for the next move.\u201d\n\nHow much faith does Zellner place in the credibility of the confession?\n\n\u201cZero. Zero. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zellner told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally fabricated. It doesn\u2019t fit any of the evidence. We\u2019ve already talked to a witness who can place Evans somewhere else that day. This guy is obviously not too bright and he\u2019s just listed things he got from public records. He\u2019s just after the money. It\u2019s unfortunate that this has gotten as much attention as it has. And who would more want it to be true than us?\u201d\n\nZellner told one local media outlet that her client laughed out loud when she read him the confession note.\n\nEven Rech isn\u2019t sure the confession will hold up.\n\n\u201cOn the \u2018no\u2019 side, he\u2019s a proven liar; he himself has proven he\u2019s a liar. He\u2019s a convicted felon. On the \u2018possibly\u2019 side, he\u2019s a convicted murderer in the state of Wisconsin, he was free at the time of [Halbach\u2019s] murder, so I don\u2019t know,\u201d Rech told USA Today. \u201cI probably lean toward \u2018no\u2019, but I think it\u2019s pretty important that it\u2019s thoroughly investigated.\u201d", "description": "Lawyer for man at center of Netflix documentary calls another prisoner\u2019s claim he killed Teresa Halbach \u2018ridiculous\u2019", "authors": ["Mario Koran"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5476daf389a8a26f86427d60c69ac0de86266566/0_101_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a6caad97f3d2717382ac15c6a89a9fe", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
