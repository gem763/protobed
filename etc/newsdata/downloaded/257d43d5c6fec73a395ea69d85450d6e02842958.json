In this kind of study individuals are observed over time for risk factors and health outcomes.\n\nOne issue with this sort of study is the effect of secondary risk factors that might bias the data. For example, people who tend to eat more red meat also have a tendency to consume alcohol, smoke and exercise less, which he said can be hard to separate out from the observed results.\n\nThe one review they did of higher quality studies, like randomized controlled trials, came to the same conclusion.\n\n\"Even the evidence base for the randomized trials is low quality or low certainty.\"\n\nThese new studies that reassessed the health risks of eating red and processed meat did not take environmental or animal welfare concerns into account. (AAMIR QURESHI/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRelative versus absolute risk\n\nJohnston said in their reviews, they only focused on \"absolute\" risk, not \"relative\" risk.\n\nIf there is a two per cent risk of cancer and by not eating meat, that risk drops by one per cent, from a relative perspective, that's a 50 per cent risk reduction, which Johnston said sounds very compelling, but the effect is actually very small.\n\n\"From an absolute perspective however, the risk is a one per cent difference.\"\n\nControversy over these studies\n\nScientists from Harvard University released a statement describing Johnston's advice based on these new studies as \"irresponsible and unethical.\"\n\nJohnston said they're \"happy that there's now more debate on this topic.\"\n\n\"If you arm rational people with the risk reductions and they understand that it's very small \u2014 if it exists at all \u2014 and that the certainty of evidence is low (...) they can make their own decisions.\"", "description": "A thorough review of the evidence suggests the risk is small if it exists at all", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309053.1570204863!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/183051528.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
