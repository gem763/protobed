They saw today's vote as an opportunity to highlight their support for the health law\u2019s patient protections and to force Republicans up for reelection to take a difficult vote.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been listening to my Republican colleagues say for years and years that though they don\u2019t love everything about the Affordable Care Act, they want to protect people with preexisting conditions,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters ahead of the vote. \u201cWell, here\u2019s their chance.\u201d\n\nHowever, several Democratic senators were absent for the vote, contributing to its wide margin of defeat.\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Mark Warner of Virginia, forced the long-shot bid through a procedural mechanism granting Congress the authority to overturn federal rules through a simple majority vote. Even if the resolution had survived the Senate, the Trump administration could have vetoed it.\n\nCollins, a moderate Republican facing reelection next year, was the lone GOP vote in favor of the resolution. She backed a similar Democratic resolution in 2018 aimed at blocking the administration\u2019s expansion of short-term health plans. That attempt narrowly failed, ending in a 50-50 tie.\n\nSenate Republicans dismissed the vote as a political stunt, accusing Democrats of misrepresenting a policy aimed at providing more flexibility. They claimed the rules are aimed at lowering premiums \u2014 not dodging benefit requirements.\n\n\u201cStates are trying to take advantage of this provision of the Affordable Care Act that says states may have some flexibility in how they spend the money \u2014 as long as, the law also says, you don\u2019t jeopardize preexisting condition [protections] for anybody,\u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), calling Democrats\u2019 resolution a \u201cscary fairy tale.\u201d\n\nNo state has applied yet for permission to exercise the greater leeway on Obamacare the Trump administration outlined a year ago.\n\nAdministration officials argue that under their watch, the Obamacare markets have improved. Premiums for key plans sold on HealthCare.gov will drop by 4 percent on average next year, marking the second straight year of declines.\n\nBut Democrats have seized on studies showing a recent rise in the uninsured rate, including a report published this week that found 400,000 more children lack coverage than in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere are only two choices here,\u201d Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said. \u201cYou stand with families or you stand with the Trump administration.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/27/6f/135e99b541bfb135b7f77366128b/191030-chris-murphy-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
