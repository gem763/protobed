If you\u2019re not a fan but have heard of it, it\u2019s probably because of the microtransactions and gambling options which, in my opinion, are the absolute worst of any modern video game. Worse than FIFA, worse than anything Activision has done, and even worse than many mobile games, since NBA 2K20 is not free.\n\nThe infuriating thing is that, as GC\u2019s review agreed, it is a great game. One of the best sports games ever and definitely the best basketball sim. And yet it\u2019s filled with so many microtransactions, and such a burning desire to fleece its players, that it\u2019s literally disgusting. You play the game and you can almost see some 2K exec on the other side of the screen hoping you\u2019re an idiot that\u2019s going to start gambling away real money just to unlock some in-game items.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when I say gambling I mean actual gambling, with slot machines and everything. Even though the cowards at PEGI refused to admit it was real gambling and gave a 3 age rating to it, while saying that it may come \u2018too close for comfort for some people\u2019 but that it wasn\u2019t really gambling.\n\nWhich of course means 2K knew they could get away with whatever they wanted. So they immediately set about changing the odds in their favour, so that that it\u2019s much harder to earn in-game achievements and much more tempting to pay real money to get it.\n\nI\u2019m obviously trying to be provocative with my title but I believe it\u2019s true. 2K (or any publisher in their position) knew the authorities aren\u2019t going to do anything about it and they were betting that gamers would just roll over and take it too.\n\nThey don\u2019t always \u2013 they didn\u2019t for Star Wars: Battlefront II and they\u2019re getting pretty angry about Call Of Duty \u2013 but sports games, which have the largest proportion of casual gamers, can usually get away with anything. You only have to look at how EA handles FIFA to know that.\n\nThankfully, in this case the fans did fight back and 2K had to backtrack. The game\u2019s still full of microtransactions and gambling but at least now it\u2019s only as bad as it was at launch. Which is still terrible but at least it hasn\u2019t got worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy point is that we have to resist this sort of thing whenever we can. Publishers not only think we\u2019re idiots they think we don\u2019t care enough to complain or do anything about it. Apathy is their ally and shield and yet as we see time and time again when gamers do complain things change.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about death threats and other antisocial behaviour, just complaining on social media and creating or joining groups of other fans to make publishers know they\u2019re not getting away with things.\n\nWe\u2019re just walking wallets to them and they haven\u2019t got any interest in our well-being or anything other than the level of addiction of their product. The people making the games are probably just as frustrated as us at microtransactions and you can tell by the quality of the games that they do care about what they\u2019re doing.\n\nThis is just the way big business work, I know, but we can fight back against it and when we do it usually works. Because if governments aren\u2019t going to keep video game publishers in line then the fans will have to do it instead.\n\nBy reader Zod\n\nThe reader\u2019s feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.
