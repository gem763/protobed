Pence said the U.S. wanted the two sides to negotiate a long-term peace, but he didn\u2019t call for Turkey to pull out of Syria.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump made it very clear that the United States is going to continue to take actions against Turkey\u2019s economy until they bring the violence to an end,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe want an immediate ceasefire and we want to begin negotiations between Turkey and Syrian defense forces.\u201d\n\nTrump, who signed an executive order imposing the sanctions on Monday, spoke with Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier in the day, Pence said.\n\nThe penalties would raise steel tariffs on Turkey back to 50%, the level before a reduction in May, and the U.S. would halt negotiations over a $100 billion trade pact, Trump said in a statement. The administration also sanctioned the Turkish ministers of defense, energy and the interior, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\n\nExperts on sanctions say the administration could have imposed restrictions last week if they had wanted to, and that Trump\u2019s talk of future sanctions is more messaging to satisfy frustrated lawmakers who may have a veto-proof majority to pass legislation and force the president\u2019s hand.\n\nIndeed, the efforts fell short of what many lawmakers considered a strong enough response.\n\nKaylin Minton, a spokeswoman for Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement: \u201cWe appreciate the administration\u2019s planned sanctions, but it does not go far enough to punish Turkey for its egregious offenses in Syria.\u201d The statement added that steeper penalties will be pursued.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been working with Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Trump ally, to pass legislation that would put harsh restrictions on the country.\n\n\u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d Trump said in the statement.\n\n\u201cIf they knew what they wanted to do, they would have done it already,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Toole, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who previously worked in the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions unit. He called Trump\u2019s announcement \u201cweak\u201d and expects Congress to pass tougher legislation.\n\nThe announcement is an effort to contain the damage from Trump\u2019s decision to stand aside if Turkey entered northern Syria, essentially giving Erdogan a green light to carry out the operation. Erdogan says the offensive is necessary to push back Kurdish militants and resettle refugees, but the rapid advance into Syria has drawn international condemnation and accusations of war crimes.\n\nSteel Tariffs\n\nLast year, Trump increased steel tariffs on Turkish imports and then cut them in May to 25%. Despite that reduction, imports from Turkey to the U.S. haven\u2019t recovered. U.S. imports of Turkish steel touched 12,749 metric tons in August, down 88% from the same month a year ago, according to Census Bureau data. Turkey accounted for 1.1% of all U.S. steel imports so far this year.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why Trump contended that a new executive order was needed to impose the sanctions.\n\nThe president also said he would halt trade negotiations with Turkey, which Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced in a speech in Ankara last month. The deal was to include the furniture, marble, autos and civil aviation industries.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision on troop withdrawal exposed American-allied Kurdish militias to attack, risking a resurgence of Islamic State and a slaughter of the Kurds. Kurdish forces that previously fought alongside the U.S. have warned they may no longer be able to secure camps and prisons holding Islamic State jihadists, including Europeans whose home countries don\u2019t want them back.\n\nTurkey\u2019s cross-border military offensive has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of \u201cterrorists\u201d since it began on Wednesday, according to Turkey\u2019s military.\n\nBefore the Trump administration\u2019s announcement, Graham sought help from Pelosi to impose sanctions on Turkey. The pair was concerned Trump wouldn\u2019t impose strong enough penalties.\n\n\u201cAs we find ourselves in a situation where the president gave a green light to the Turks to bomb and effectively unleashed ISIS, we must have a stronger sanctions package than what the White House is suggesting,\u201d Pelosi tweeted Monday.\n\nTrump\u2019s said the U.S. won\u2019t tolerate the \u201cindiscriminate targeting of civilians, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and targeting of ethnic or religious minorities.\u201d\n\nThe president said \u201ca small footprint\u201d of U.S. forces will remain at Al-Tanf Garrison in southern Syria to fight Islamic State.\n\n(Corrects attribution of Republican statement, in eighth paragraph)", "description": "U.S. Urges Syria Cease-Fire as It Sanctions Turkey", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic29d90a45db12e5eea064af7c17f0e68c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
