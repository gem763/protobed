The group was discovered by police on October 14, one day after 25-year-old Jan Zon van Dorsten turned up at a local bar asking for help. Van Dorsten lead police to a room hidden behind a cupboard where he and his five siblings, along with their ailing 67-year-0ld father had allegedly been living for the past nine years.\n\nAn Austrian man by the name of Josef Brunner is believed to have aided in keeping the group on the farm against their will. Brunner, 58, is in police custody and has officially been charged with false imprisonment. He is not cooperating with investigators. Gerrit Jan van Dorsten, the alleged father of the group found on the farm, is also in police custody and was arrested on suspicion of deprivation of liberty, and harming the health of others. Police suspect both men were also involved in money laundering, after they found large sums of money on the farm.\n\nThe group may have been involved in cult activities, say police.\n\n\"We have reason to believe that the six people involved did not stay at the premises out of free will. We are investigating whether following a certain belief in life or faith has led to the living situation in which the people were found,\" police said, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency.\n\nOnly 4,000 people live in the town of Ruinerwold. There is a vegetable shop, a beauty salon, a butcher, a petrol station, a fire department, a hotel, three cafes and two bike shops \u2014 we're in the Netherlands, after all. Ruinerwold is the type of place where, when you look up at the sky after the sun has gone down, you can see the stars and the Milky Way. It's quaint and quiet.\n\nRuinerwold 2 More\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe farm where the group was discovered is just a five-minute bike ride from the town's center. Curious locals and media crews from all over the world have spent days milling about, desperate to learn more of the story, and police have been kept busy monitoring the property. Accredited media are allowed about fifty meters closer to the farm than those without a press card.\n\nA friendly town where locals keep to themselves\n\nIt is hard to imagine keeping seven people hidden here for nine years, but at the same time, it wouldn't be difficult. People in Ruinerwold are friendly, but they also keep to themselves. The exterior of the farm where they were found is barely visible from the road. The farm consists of several buildings that are mostly hidden from view by trees and shrub, and to enter, you need to cross a sturdy iron bridge. Brunner, who made money as a furniture maker, was believed to live alone.\n\nA neighbor says he once tried to take a peek over the fence leading to the front door and saw several cameras monitoring the property. Another neighbor claims to have gone over when the group moved in to welcome them to the village, but he says he was never allowed in.\n\n\"Josef took the flowers, thanked me, and promptly closed the door in my face,\" he said.", "description": "Family members of the Gerritt Jan van Dorsten say he \"broke all ties\" the family in the 1980s and believe he may have been trying to start a cult.", "authors": ["Ester Meerman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fW4uoH6KykvjKwnuzdLx2w--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/4f22a62c6f762de55722c05bda1061b9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
