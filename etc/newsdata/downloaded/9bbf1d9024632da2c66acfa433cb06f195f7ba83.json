I say \u201cgutsy\u201d because in elite academic circles these days, even the slightest dissent from the idea that the quest for more diversity is always good, always a step toward social justice is apt to land you in hot water with the \u201cprogressives.\u201d Kronman does more than slightly dissent. He argues that the diversity mania has been quite harmful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Martin Center was fortunate enough to get former Harvard dean Harry Lewis, author of a splendid book himself (Excellence Without a Soul), to review Kronman\u2019s book and today we publish his review.\n\nAmerican colleges and universities have been dominated by a \u201cdiversity\u201d agenda since the 1978 Bakke case, where Justice Powell\u2019s lone opinion was the fulcrum for the Court, an opinion in which he suggested off-hand that it might be all right for schools to use race as a small \u201cplus-factor\u201d to achieve some possible educational benefits from having a more diverse student body. That has had very harmful consequences. Lewis writes, \u201cMost of all, Kronman argues, Powell\u2019s pretext for considering race in college admissions has created a generation of academic liars, who are doing pretty much what Powell said they couldn\u2019t with admissions while using his loophole as an excuse for doing it.\u201d That is to say, college officials say that they run their preference programs in order to improve the climate for learning when what they\u2019re actually doing is just seeking racial quotas.\n\nThe harmful effects have rippled throughout our campuses. Among them is speech. \u201cDiversity has both sensitized and numbed the ears of everyone on campus\u201d Lewis writes. \u201cWhether or not \u201cthe most qualified person should get the job\u201d is offensive speech , \u2018I hope a diverse person will get the job\u2019 is abominable.\u201d And it leads to a huge waste of money: \u201cDiversity training is ubiquitous, never mind that that such crash courses, part of a multibillion-dollar diversity industry, seem to have little lasting effect and may even be counterproductive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKronman and Lewis also see the damage that racial preferences for \u201cdiversity\u201d do to the students who are given places in elite colleges where they aren\u2019t really academically competitive. As Lewis says, \u201cThis preparation bias is unfair but does not excite outrage, even though nothing makes students feel less \u2018included and belonging\u2019 than to lack the educational background of their classmates.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. ever breaks free of its diversity mania, the forthright views of a few people like Anthony Kronman and Harry Lewis will no doubt play an important role.", "description": "If the U.S. ever breaks free of its diversity mania, the forthright views of a few people like Anthony Kronman and Harry Lewis will no doubt play an important role.", "authors": ["George Leef", "Andrew C.
