Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not the first time that Trump has attacked San Francisco, a progressive-leaning city. In mid-September, he accused the city of allowing a tremendous amount of waste, including needles, go through storm drains into the ocean -- and threatened to set the Environmental Protection Agency on the city, according to CBS News.\n\nCALIFORNIA LAW EXPEDITES L.A. HOMELESS SHELTER DEVELOPMENT\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in serious violation,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cThey have to clean it up. We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d\n\nBut local officials pushed back against that claim. Mayor London Breed called Trump's comments at the time \"ridiculous,\u201d saying that storm drain debris is filtered out at city wastewater treatment plants so that it does not flow into the bay or ocean.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAt the beginning of October, Trump followed up on his threat as the EPA issued a notice accusing San Francisco of violating the federal Clean Water Act. In a letter to the city\u2019s general manager of the city\u2019s Public Utilities Commission, Harlan Kelly, Jr., the EPA said it identified several violations in the city, including the lack of proper operation and maintenance that has allowed raw and partially treated sewage to flow into the ocean, and sometimes into streets and homes, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHomelessness in some California cities has surged in recent years; in San Francisco, it rose 17 percent, compared to the last count two years ago, according to The New York Times. Californians also named it as one of the top issues facing the state, according to a poll released last month by the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "It\u2019s also not the first time that Trump has attacked San Francisco, a progressive-leaning city.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Trump-medicare.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
