The estate, which has been on and off the market since 2016, was originally priced at $3.6 million.\n\nIt is currently listed for $2.65 million with The Agency. It will be auctioned by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, which announced the sale on Sept. 5.\n\nIt is currently listed for $2.65 million with The Agency, which put it on the market about two years ago, listing agent Jack Luciano said. It will be auctioned by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, which announced the sale on Sept. 5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of only 14 circular homes Wright designed,\u201d Mr. Luciano said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only had two owners, which is unheard of with Frank Lloyd Wright homes. I hope it goes to a buyer who appreciates and understands Wright\u2019s designs.\u201d\n\nAccording to property records, Linda Melton, who was only the second owner, bought the property in 1994 for $500,000. Melton, who was the owner, records keeper and billing agent of several telephone companies in the United States, died in 2011.\n\nNate Schar, director of real estate for Heritage Auctions, said Melton\u2019s two daughters have been the owners of the property since her death.\n\n\u201cThey love the house, which is why have held onto it for eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they feel it is time for closure.\u201d\n\nAlthough the daughters have never lived on the property, they have maintained it, and in recent years it has been used occasionally as a venue for political fundraisers and for other events, Mr. Schar said.\n\nMore: The Lure of Understated Luxury\n\nThe 3,095-square-foot house, which is on 1.3 acres on the edge of the Phoenix Mountains Preserve, was designed by Wright before his death in 1959 for Norman and Aimee Lykes and was built by his apprentice, John Rattenbury, in 1967.\n\nThe house is currently listed for $2.65 million with The Agency. CRAIG ROOT\n\nAfter Melton bought the property, she hired Mr. Rattenbury to convert the five bedrooms, some of which were only closet-sized, to three; the plans were approved by Wright\u2019s foundation.\n\nFrom Penta For Cutting-Edge Electric Performance, Automakers\u2014including Porsche\u2014are Turning to Rimac\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collectible piece of real estate, a priceless piece of art,\u201d Mr. Schar said. \u201cIt\u2019s timeless, and it\u2019s still incredibly livable. Best of all is that you can view the Biltmore hotel and shopping district from the living room. You can see 50 to 100 miles on a clear day, and the design keeps the sun out. They don\u2019t build them this way any more.\u201d\n\nThe house, which is made of concrete blocks that were colored to blend with the surrounding boulders, is being sold with its Mid-Century Modern furnishings, which Mr. Schar said include six of Wright\u2019s Origami chairs.\n\nThe property, which overlooks the Palm Canyon, has a gated driveway, a pool on the garden terrace that is lined with mother of pearl, a two-vehicle carport with a covered walkway to the house and a master suite with a balcony. The interior, which features built-ins, is made of Philippine mahogany.\n\nCircular Sun House was designed right before the opening of Wright\u2019s Guggenheim Museum, which also plays with the possibilities of circles.\n\nMr. Luciano noted that the fireplace in the home\u2019s great room has a rounded profile that resembles that of the Guggenheim\u2019s iconic staircase.\n\nThe auction was first reported by Curbed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Mansion Global.", "description": "The 3,095-square-foot Phoenix estate was last listed for $2.65 million", "authors": ["Nancy A.
