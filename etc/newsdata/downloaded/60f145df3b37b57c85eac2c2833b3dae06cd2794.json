But when you have a superstar partner like this who just bombs it, you just have to be very happy.\n\n\u201cI mean, this girl I think is the best golfer I\u2019ve ever seen on the women\u2019s side. And today she just was absolutely a rock star.\u201d\n\nVan Dam added: \u201cI was so relaxed. Standing on the first tee Suzann told me, \u2018Just enjoy this experience\u2019, and that\u2019s what I did. I saw so many of my family and friends, hit a good drive and good iron shot and I was just rolling after that.\u201d\n\nIn the morning foursomes, Caroline Masson and Jodi Ewart Shadoff were thrashed 6&4 by sisters Jessica and Nelly Korda before the home side fought back with victories from Georgia Hall and Celine Boutier and Hull and Munoz.\n\nThe first match between Ciganda and Law and Morgan Pressel and Marina Alex was halved to leave the contest finely poised ahead of the afternoon fourballs, with the four players on each side who sat out the morning session getting their first taste of the action.\n\nPA", "description": "Suzann Pettersen justified her controversial selection and silenced Danielle Kang into the bargain as Europe had to settle for a slender lead after the opening day of the 16th Solheim Cup.
