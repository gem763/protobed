When the prosecutors walked into the hall, they broke into cheers.\n\nGuyger sat alone, weeping, at the defence table.\n\nIn Texas, the sentence for murder is from five to 99 years in prison. The jury will consider her fate after hearing additional testimony starting Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe basic facts of the unusual shooting were not in dispute throughout the trial.\n\nBotham Jean's mother, Allison Jean, centre, escorted by civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, right, is hugged by family members outside the courtroom after the verdict was handed down on Tuesday.

She was off duty but still dressed in her police uniform after a long shift when she shot Jean with her service weapon. The 26-year-old accountant had been eating a bowl of ice cream before Guyger entered his home.\n\nJean, who grew up in the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, came to the U.S. for college and starting his career as an accountant. His shooting drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\n'I thought it was my apartment'\n\nGuyger was arrested three days after the killing. She was later fired and charged with murder, but only spoke publicly about the shooting upon taking the witness stand last Friday. Tension has been high during the trial in Dallas, the same city where an attack three years ago killed five police officers.\n\nThe 31-year-old tearfully apologized for killing Jean and told the jurors she feared for her life upon finding the door to what she thought was her apartment unlocked. Guyger said that Jean came toward her at a fast walk when she entered with her gun out, but prosecutors have suggested he was just rising from a couch toward the back of the room when the officer shot him.\n\nBotham Jean was shot in his apartment by his neighbour, an off-duty Dallas police officer.

Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants to the wrong apartments.\n\nProsecutors, however, questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place, and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages with her married police partner.\n\nThey also asked why Guyger didn't radio in for help when she thought there was a break-in at her home. Guyger said that going through the doorway with her pistol drawn \"was the only option that went through my head.\"\n\nThe case attracted international attention.\n\nPresidential contender Beto O'Rourke, a Texas native, said on social media: \"Botham's family, his friends, his community will never see him again \u2013 so there is no justice. But, at least, there is accountability.\"", "description": "A white former Dallas police officer, Amber Guyger, has been found guilty of murder in the fatal shooting of her unarmed, black neighbour in his apartment.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5304210.1569945327!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/texas-crime-amber-guyger.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
