Robinson said he had used provocative language such as \u201ccollaborators\u201d. Boris Johnson said: \u201cI didn\u2019t actually say collaborators \u2013 go back over the quotation.\u201d\n\nThe BBC presenter said: \u201cYou said collaboration.\u201d To which the prime minister replied: \u201cCorrect.\u201d What he had actually said, on 14 August, was: \u201cThere\u2019s a terrible kind of collaboration as it were, going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends.\u201d\n\nIt was an inflammatory word, invoking the language of the Second World War, when it was used to describe those people in countries occupied by the Nazis who cooperated with the enemy.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe reason Robinson mentioned it was that the idea had been revived by the front-page headline in the Mail on Sunday: \u201cNo 10 probes Remain MPs\u2019 \u2018foreign collusion\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis was a news report based on a quotation from a \u201csenior No 10 source\u201d, who said the government was \u201cworking on extensive investigations\u201d into Dominic Grieve, Oliver Letwin and Hilary Benn, the backbench MPs who drafted the law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit at the end of this month.\n\nThe No 10 source said the inquiry would look at \u201ctheir involvement with foreign powers and the funding of their activities. Governments have proper rules for drafting legislation, but nobody knows what organisations are pulling these strings.\n\n\u201cWe will demand the disclosure of all details of their personal communications with other states. The drafting of primary legislation in collusion with foreign powers must be fully investigated.\u201d\n\nThis briefing, and Johnson\u2019s original comment, seem to be part of a tactic associated with Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, of provoking the opponents of a no-deal exit. The aim may be to induce vehement denials and condemnation, which draw attention to the kernel of truth in Johnson\u2019s charge.\n\nIn this case, it is true that some of the opponents of a no-deal exit, including Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, have had discussions with people in Brussels and other EU capitals about the length and terms of an extension to the Brexit deadline that would be acceptable to them.\n\nHence the Benn act requires the prime minister, if there is no Brexit deal by 19 October, to seek a three-month extension, taking the deadline to 31 January next year.\n\nHowever, this is a reasonable proposal, in the absence of a majority in the Commons for a deal, and can no more be described as \u201ccollusion\u201d than Theresa May\u2019s agreement with other EU leaders to postpone the 29 March deadline.\n\nThere is of course heated language on both sides. The prime minister\u2019s opponents \u2013 including Hammond \u2013 have recently suggested that he wants to leave the EU without a deal because some Tory donors stand to gain large amounts of money from speculating that the pound will fall.\n\nGiven that no lawyer has yet suggested how a no-deal exit is possible under the Benn act \u2013 except by EU leaders \u201ccolluding\u201d with Johnson to force us out, which they seem disinclined to do \u2013 this is a peculiar theory.\n\nPerhaps both sides should desist from accusing the other of bad faith.", "description": "The prime minister tangled with Nick Robinson on the Today programme yesterday.
