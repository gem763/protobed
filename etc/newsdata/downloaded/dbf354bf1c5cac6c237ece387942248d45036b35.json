Although this isn\u2019t always stated explicitly, it explains both the vehement opposition to Trump\u2019s proposed wall on the border with Mexico (whose construction actually began under Bill Clinton) and the insistence on rolling back regulation on immigration flows.\n\nYet this is a weak position, for at least two reasons. First, states presuppose borders. Failing to control borders is not an immigration policy, but the lack of one. It\u2019s also a position likely to reinforce the already widespread perception that immigration flows are \u201cout of control\u201d.\n\nSecond, the case for open borders relies on premises that are more usually associated with the libertarian right than the liberal or social-democratic left. The idea is that allowing the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market to determine where people live will benefit everyone because workers will naturally move to where there is more demand for them. But the left has historically been skeptical of that premise \u2013 holding instead that markets need to be regulated in order to lead to socially optimal outcomes.\n\nA stronger case in favor of immigration \u2013 that\u2019s also more coherent with the left\u2019s traditional values \u2013 can be built on demographic data. This is not something the American left has paid much attention to so far. Yet, the evidence is clear: net of immigration, the US population is both shrinking and ageing at an alarming rate.\n\nIf the trend continues, it threatens both the economic vitality of the country as a whole and widely cherished welfare programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which require a young and economically active tax base.\n\nThe right\u2019s response is to call for Americans to have more children. But this only makes sense on the chauvinistic assumption that immigration is a threat for the country\u2019s civic culture. Immigration is a faster and more efficient way to replenish the country\u2019s work-force.\n\nThe left should therefore seize on the demographic data and openly make the case that the United States needs more immigrants, not just because cultural diversity is a good in itself, but also because this is essential to maintain current levels of economic growth and welfare provision.\n\nOne way to tailor immigration flows specifically to the country\u2019s demographic needs is through a points-based system like those of Canada and Australia. Yet this is not absolutely necessary; all the available evidence shows that even low-skilled immigrants more than pay for themselves in terms of tax revenue, beginning with the second generation. (First-generation immigrants cost the fiscal system marginally more than they contribute, largely because they have more children.)\n\nA more plausible objection concerns immigration\u2019s distributive effects. Both the nationalist right and, more recently, some currents of the hard left have argued that immigration negatively affects certain sectors of the population, because it increases competition among workers and puts downward pressure on wages and working conditions.\n\nIn reality, the empirical evidence for these claims is far from conclusive. But even if these claims were undeniably true, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a weakness of the left case for more immigration, since it shifts the debate to a terrain on which the left should be happy to argue.\n\nIf the problem is that immigration harms certain sectors of the population while increasing aggregate levels of growth, then surely the response should be to call for more economic redistribution alongside higher levels of immigration, so that everyone benefits from the added wealth generated by immigrants.\n\nThe same goes for working conditions. If there\u2019s any reason to suppose that immigration adversely affects workers\u2019 rights, it\u2019s because a large proportion of the immigrant workforce is currently illegal, which makes it harder for them to unionize and claim the rights legal workers are entitled to.\n\nPresumably, any policy aimed at fostering the number of immigrants entering the country would have to grant them the same rights as legal workers. So, it could actually end up bolstering the bargaining power of organized labor.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t have to be a tradeoff between immigration and welfare programs or workers\u2019 rights. On the contrary, they are two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe United States needs more immigrants to maintain current levels of economic growth and welfare provision, but it also needs more economic redistribution and workers\u2019 rights to make sure that the aggregate benefits of immigration are shared fairly within society as a whole.", "description": "The US needs more immigrants to maintain current levels of economic growth and welfare provision \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean unlimited migration", "authors": ["Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a80e7f18fe403ef728c1870561f6a717ccc5bfd9/0_166_4971_2983/master/4971.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e292e79aad7cb50c7f00ad6cd30b78bb", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
