(Photo by Santiago Bluguermann/Getty Images)\n\nColdplay frontman Chris Martin has revealed the band's upcoming album Everyday Life has been been influenced by real world events, including the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nThe 42-year-old explained some the the album was inspired by \u201ctrying to empathise about what other people are going through\u201d.\n\nHe told DJ Annie Mac on Radio 1's Future Sounds: \u201cThe truth is there was something about our last tour that made me at peace with speaking openly and not minding if people disagree\u2026\n\nRead more: Chris Martin was meant to play Ed Sheeran role in 'Yesterday' says Danny Boyle\n\n\u201cThis has been the first time we\u2019ve felt like: \u2018We\u2019ve got to this place as a band so there\u2019s really nothing to think about career-wise.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou can just speak completely freely and let all the colours of life come through.\n\nChris Martin of Coldplay performs on stage at BC Place on September 29, 2017 in Vancouver, Canada.

I wasn't very good at it.
