Maxx's Website. Here Are My Secret Strategies", "language": "en", "text": "As a bargain lover, I\u2019m a big fan of discount chain T.J. Maxx. I\u2019ve found some great deals in stores, of course, and I periodically browse the T.J. Maxx online store since it launched in 2013.\n\nI\u2019m apparently not alone in my devotion to T.J. Maxx; the retailer\u2019s corporate parent TJX Companies has won praise from business writers and investors alike for its uncanny ability to thrive in both boom economies as well as lean years. In fact, MONEY noted earlier this year that TJX added 11 new T.J. Maxx stores in the first few months of 2019 \u2014 in spite of the quote-unquote retail apocalypse.\n\nTJX president and CEO Ernie Herman has called the appeal for shoppers a \u201ctreasure-hunt shopping experience,\u201d and that, in a nutshell, is the crux of T.J. Maxx\u2019s success. Even though I write about money for a living, I admit it feels good to stumble across high-end designer item mixed in with more discount goods \u2014 and priced similarly.\n\nIt\u2019s a nearly visceral thrill, and it keeps shoppers coming back. You return because inventory turns over constantly, and the scarcity of items prompts you to impulse-buy. After all, if you don\u2019t buy it now, it probably won\u2019t be there next time.\n\nThat \u201ctreasure-hunt\u201d aspect of shopping at T.J. Maxx and its sister stores, Marshalls and Home Goods, is key to the company\u2019s sales \u2014 the more you browse, the more likely you are to find something else you didn\u2019t know you \u201cneeded.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that searching through the T.J. Maxx treasure hunt online is not nearly as fast or easy as most other online shopping experiences. T.J. Maxx deliberately makes it kind of a pain in the neck for would-be fashionistas to search its website for designer-label items at cut-rate prices: You can\u2019t shop higher-end and luxury brands by name at the T.J. Maxx online store.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for, say, glittery high-top Ugg sneakers ($59.99 at T.J. Maxx, which is about $12 cheaper than Amazon.com) or a studded Christian Louboutin handbag ($470 off the admittedly jaw-dropping $2,070 list price) and put either brand name into the T.J. Maxx website\u2019s search box, you get back a cutesy little message about the brands being \u201cshy.\u201d\n\nIn other words, you\u2019re pretty much reduced to the virtual equivalent of sifting through the racks, not unlike the in-store treasure hunt experience. Even if you\u2019re searching by category \u2014 say, women\u2019s activewear \u2014 items from brands like New Balance are displayed with a notation that says \u201cReveal Designer,\u201d so you have to stop scrolling and click in order to see the actual brand name.\n\nBut in my years of exploring the T.J. Maxx website I\u2019ve discovered a few tricks that can help you outsmart this blockade if you\u2019re looking for a specific item from one of the \u201chidden\u201d designers on TJMaxx.com. By the way, we\u2019re putting \u201chidden\u201d in quotes here because brands or logos are often clearly visible in pictures of the items, even when the names are obscured in the text. It\u2019s all kind of a cat-and-mouse game, but I\u2019ve cracked the code for how to play \u2014 and win.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do to find designer brand items at the T.J. Maxx website:\n\nSearch By Item Name\n\nA lot of brands, especially more expensive ones, name their products the way carmakers have model names (like the way Toyota has the Camry, the Corolla, etc.). In many cases, the non-hidden copy included in the item listing on the T.J. Maxx site will include that name.\n\nFor instance, this workout-friendly fleece jacket from Marmot \u2014 one of the apparel and gear brands I swear by for running in lousy weather \u2014 won\u2019t turn up if you try to search for \u201cMarmot.\u201d But if you saw the jacket on another site and know that it\u2019s called \u201cTorla,\u201d you\u2019re good to go. Type that into the search box, and presto! It will deliver the goods. The gray is probably a discontinued color, so at $49.99, it\u2019s a serious deal, since this jacket in this season\u2019s colors is $120 on Marmot\u2019s own website.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure if an item you\u2019re looking for has a particular name or what it is, your best bet is probably that brand\u2019s own website, but you may be able to find it from browsing other retail sites, as well.\n\nSearch By Material\n\nThis tip tends to be most useful for activewear (a popular category for me to shop, in case you couldn\u2019t tell.) Use the search function to find things like activewear made from Under Armour\u2019s proprietary \u201cColdGear\u201d fabric or its sweat-wicking \u201cBreathelux\u201d line. From there, you\u2019ll probably have to filter the results by gender, type of clothing, color and so on, but it\u2019s way easier than doing an item-by-item scroll through an entire category. And the deals can be awesome: These \u201cBreathelux\u201d Under Armour leggings are just $24.99 \u2014 a fraction of the $70.99 you\u2019d pay on Under Armour\u2019s own website.", "description": "The site won't let you search by brand name.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y520yKU67MaMnfYI52xdNA--~B/aD0yNTMzO3c9MzgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/357cebc9e76257b0163070efc39f9407", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
