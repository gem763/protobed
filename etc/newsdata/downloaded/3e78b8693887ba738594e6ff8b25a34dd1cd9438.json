Minnesota, which Trump lost by 1.5 percentage points to Democrat Hillary Clinton, is a key target, his campaign said.\n\nHe faces tough odds. No Republican presidential candidate has won Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972. Trump\u2019s unfavorability number in Minnesota is 11 points higher than his favorability rating, according to Morning Consult polling.\n\nBut Trump has said it was a mistake not to spend more time and money in the Midwestern state in 2016, and his campaign vowed the mistake would not be repeated.\n\n\"This is a campaign on offense. This is a campaign going into states other campaigns couldn\u2019t put in play,\" Bill Stepien, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said in a phone interview.\n\nTrump will again use his rally to fire up his base, which has remained firmly behind him in opinion polls after Democrats last month launched an impeachment investigation into the president.\n\nThe House of Representatives probe centers on a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that Trump used U.S. military aid to secure a promise from Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing. The White House said on Tuesday it would refuse to participate in the \"partisan and unconstitutional\" impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe rally is taking place in Minneapolis in the congressional district of Representative Ilhan Omar, a progressive Democrat who is one of Trump's most vocal critics.\n\nThe Somalia-born congresswoman was one of four female lawmakers who Trump said this summer should \"go back\" to where they came from if they did not like his policies. At a rally in North Carolina soon afterward, Trump supporters chanted: \"Send her back\" when he again blasted Omar.\n\nAhead of Trump's visit to her state this week, Omar and other Democratic officials said the president's rhetoric was not in line with their local values.\n\n\"Minnesota stands for peace, equity, and justice - everything you are against,\" Omar tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nRUNNING UP THE RURAL VOTE\n\nTrump's campaign disagrees.\n\nLike Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016, Minnesota has a large rural population that can erase Democratic gains in urban centers.\n\nThe campaign points to the state\u2019s 8th Congressional District, home to Minnesota's mining industry and once a reliable Democratic stronghold, as a sign that Trump's message resonates with voters there.\n\nTrump won the district by 15 percentage points in 2016, after Democratic President Barack Obama won it four years earlier by about 5 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the epicenter of Minnesota\u2019s changing political culture,\u201d Stepien said. \u201cThat\u2019s a district that sees what\u2019s happening in D.C., with Democrats lurching further and further to the left. It\u2019s a district that wants jobs, wants mining, wants less regulation, all the things that Trump talked about in 2016.\u201d\n\nTrump lost the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul by greater margins than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. But he won the rest of the state by bigger numbers than Romney.\n\nRepublican strategists in the state said the suburban counties around Minneapolis would decide the election. Polls show Trump struggling nationally with suburban voters.\n\n\u201cI understand why the campaign needs to show it's expanding the map, but I think winning Minnesota is going to be a real challenge,\u201d said one Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nKen Martin, chair of Minnesota's Democratic Party, said the Trump campaign had built the biggest political operation he had ever seen for any Republican this early in the election cycle, but that it would not translate to victory. He said Trump was unpopular in the fastest-growing parts of the state - the suburbs and exurbs.\n\n\u201cIf Trump think he\u2019s going to flip Minnesota just by dealing with folks in greater Minnesota, which is the rural parts of the state, he\u2019s obviously not a math wizard,\" Martin said. \"He needs to understand where the votes come from in the state, and where those votes come from, he\u2019s not very popular.\u201d", "description": "Minnesota, which Trump lost by 1.5 percentage points to Democrat Hillary Clinton, is a key target, his campaign said.
