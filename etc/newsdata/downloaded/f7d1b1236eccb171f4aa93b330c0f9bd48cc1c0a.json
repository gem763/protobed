There was major volatility in global markets last week as traders were worried about the health of the worldwide economy due to a string of disappointing services manufacturing and services reports. The UK services sector slipped back into contraction territory; the German manufacturing reading was the lowest reading in 10 years, as was the US ISM manufacturing update. It is clear the German as well as the US economy is slowing down, hence why there was a sharp decline in global stocks in the middle of last week.\n\n\n\nTrading was cautious on the run-up to the US jobs report as dealers were fearful that a soft jobs report could spark another round of selling. The headline number showed that 136,000 jobs were added in September, but the consensus estimate was 145,000. The August report was revised higher by 38,000 to 168,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, a fifty-year low. Average earnings cooled to 2.9%, from 3.2%. Overall it was a good job report, which prompted traders to buy back into equity markets. The announcement took away some of the fear about the health of the US economy.\n\n\n\nThere are pockets of weakness in the US economy, but there are also pockets of strength. There is still talk the Fed will cut interest rates later this month, but seeing as the unemployment rate is at a multi-decade low, there is a good argument for the Fed to hold fire.\n\n\n\nUS-China trade talks will resume this week, so traders will be paying close attention, as the trade spat between the two largest economies in the world has been a major source of volatility in the past year. Stocks in Asia largely traded lower overnight as traders aren\u2019t overly hopeful of a deal being struck. It was reported that China had narrowed the number of topics they are willing to discuss, which has suppressed investment sentiment. It is believed that China isn\u2019t willing to compromise on things like government subsidies or industrial policy \u2013 areas the US team is keen for them to reform.\n\n\n\nBrexit negotiations will be in focus this week, and French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK would have until the end of the week to update its proposals for leaving the EU. Prime Minister Johnson reiterated his view that the UK will be leaving the EU at the end of the month, even though a law has been introduced to force Mr. Johnson to request an extension to avoid a no-deal scenario.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump is likely to remain under pressure in relation to the impeachment inquiry as a second whistleblower has come for forwarding. The individual allegedly has information about Trump\u2019s controversial dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\n\nGerman industrial orders will be posted at 7 am (UK time), and economists are expecting a decline of -0.3%. This will be closely watched in light of the dreadful manufacturing figures from Germany last week.\n\n\n\nThe Halifax survey of UK house prices will be revealed at 8.30 am (UK time). The report is tipped to show a 0.1% increase on a monthly basis, which would be cool down from the 0.3% posted in August.\n\n\n\n\u2013 remains in the wider bearish trend, and if the negative move continues, it might target 1.0800. A snapback might encounter resistance in the 1.1100 area.\n\n\n\n\u2013 has been pushing lower for over one week, but if it holds the 50-day moving average at 1.2251 could pave the way for 1.2600 to be retested. A move to the downside might bring 1.2200 into play.\n\n\n\n\u2013 while it holds above the 200-day moving average at 0.8833, the outlook should remain bullish, and 0.9000 might act as resistance. A break below 0.8786, might put 0.8724 on the radar.\n\n\n\n\u2013 since mid-September, it has turned lower, and while it holds below the 50-day moving average at 106.99, the bearish move might continue, which could pave the way for 106.00 to be retested. 108.47 might act as resistance to a positive move.\n\n\n\nFTSE 100 is expected to open 9 points lower at 7,146\n\n\n\nis expected to open 6 points higher at 12,018\n\n\n\nis expected to open 2 points lower at 5,486\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
