While there have been big changes in how the Fed influences short-term rates to accomplish its monetary policy goals, it has long grown its overall holdings via modestly sized and regular purchases of Treasury securities.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s bond-buying would likely be announced in advance, and not done unpredictably, as was the practice before the financial crisis.\n\nBefore the financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet rose slowly and steadily. That pattern changed in 2008 as the Fed slashed its short-term interest rate target to near zero and embarked on what would be several rounds of long-term bond-buying, as a way of providing stimulus to the economy.\n\nThose purchases boosted Fed holdings from just over $800 billion to a peak of $4.5 trillion.\n\nThe Fed began to return monetary policy to a more normal footing starting with rate increases at the end of 2015. In 2017, it began taking steps to reduce the size of its balance sheet. It ended that process last month after the central bank lowered rates in late July for the first time in over a decade.\n\nFed officials have long said that holdings would again grow at some point but they haven\u2019t given a firm timetable.\n\nA technically driven expansion of Fed holdings now stands in the shadows of other issues faced by the Fed. The central bank is broadly expected to press forward with more rate cuts this year as it seeks to provide insurance again trade uncertainty and slower global growth in an otherwise healthy domestic economy.\n\nIf the U.S. economy takes a negative turn, the Fed could easily lower rates again to near-zero levels. It would likely then turn to long-term bond-buying as a stimulus tool, and any interventions of that sort would likely dwarf anything that would be done as part of technical adjustments.\n\nThe New York Fed\u2019s report also noted that it continues to expect its holdings to remain profitable for the central bank. The Fed funds itself largely from interest income on the bonds it owns, with excess profits returned to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe annual report also assumes that compared with the Fed\u2019s current target-rate range of between 2% and 2.25%, the federal-funds rate will fall to 1.2% by the second quarter of 2021. The report said the long-run level for the funds rate is expected to be 1.5%.\n\nWrite to Michael S.
