The country\u2019s civil war ended in 2002.\n\nHarry described landmines an \u201cunhealed scar of war\u201d and said, \u201cBy clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity. Additionally, we can protect the diverse and unique wildlife that relies on the beautiful Kuito river that I slept beside last night.\n\n\u201cThat river and those wildlife are your natural assets and, if looked after, will bring you unlimited opportunities in the conservation-led economy.\u201d\n\nAs unimaginable as it may seem now, Diana\u2019s involvement with an anti-landmine organisation was deeply controversial at the time.\n\nHer call for countries to ban landmines was seen by some politicians as inappropriately political, as the U.K. was at that stage still selling vast numbers of landmines to questionable regimes around the world.\n\nA Conservative lawmaker, David Wilshire, complained: \u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to allow one young woman to alter the entire British constitution single-handed. If the Royal family plays party politics, it automatically changes the entire nature of the Royal family.\u201d\n\nAnother critic was the Conservative Sir James Hill, who called for Diana to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d and \u201creprimanded\u201d for entering the \u201cpolitical arena\u201d and said: \u201cShe could have been a Hollywood movie star for the way she attracts publicity.\u201d\n\nHe made his comments on 26 Aug, 1997.\n\nFive days later, Diana was dead.", "description": "Harry picked his way through an African minefield today. When his mother did the same thing 22 years ago, she was condemned as a publicity-seeking political meddler.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_575,w_1024,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569575372/GettyImages-1171393784_zbhxoh", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
