This time, four of Jolie's six children posed on the carpet with her: Zahara (who has been with her mother at all the premieres), Shiloh (who was at the Rome and Los Angeles premieres), and twins Knox and Vivienne (who were at the Los Angeles premiere). Maddox is at college in South Korea (he joined at the Tokyo premiere), and Pax stayed behind this time (he was at the LA premiere).\n\nAnd like the fashion icons they are, Angie's children all coordinated in black and white to complement their mother's white gown.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Dave J Hogan - Getty Images More\n\nView photos Photo credit: David M. Benett - Getty Images More\n\nJolie's co-star Elle Fanning also joined the group at the premiere, wearing her own pale green princess dress. Fanning made headlines earlier this week for talking to InStyle about playing paintball with Jolie and the Jolie-Pitt kids while they were shooting the film. Angie was very skilled, apparently.\n\nView photos Photo credit: Dave J Hogan - Getty Images More\n\n\"With Angelina, I was so young when I did the first [Maleficent] film with her. I was very nervous then,\" Fanning said of her experience working on the first film and sequel. \"My mom was with me. Now that I\u2019m grown up, she sees me in a different way. We talked about different things. We went paintballing.\"\n\nJolie was so good at this, Fanning couldn't compete. \"Oh, she's aggressive,\" Fanning said with a laugh. \"We would do outings because her kids were there [while we were working on Maleficent: Mistress of Evil], so she was trying to schedule activities on the weekends. I had never gone paintballing before. We were in full-on armor. We were the only people in the place, with all of her kids. She and I were not on the same team. I was so bad. I hit their security guard in the neck, and he was on my team! Angelina's really good.\"\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Everyone looks so good!", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vPFU6CBiIovrSZbOFlSc0Q--~B/aD01MTQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/06add368a984ce7be7320cab39172392", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
