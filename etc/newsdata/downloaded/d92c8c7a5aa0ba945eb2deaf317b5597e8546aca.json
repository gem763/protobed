But he also accused her parents of exploiting that passion.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s mother, Malena Ernman, is an opera singer; her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor. They wrote a parenting book, called \u201cScenes From the Heart,\u201d that chronicles their daughter\u2019s climate awakening. An English-language version, under the revised title \u201cOur House Is on Fire,\u201d is due to be published next year.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg (Photos: Pavel Golovkin/AP, Jason DeCrow/AP) More\n\nLast month, Thunberg excoriated attendees at the United Nations climate summit for their inaction.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d Thunberg said, reading from a piece of paper. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you come to us young people for hope. How dare you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are suffering,\u201d she continued through tears. \u201cPeople are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, whose administration has rolled back environmental protections and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, seemed to mock Thunberg in a tweet that included a video clip of her speech.\n\n\u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cSo nice to see!\u201d\n\nThe 16-year-old responded by changing her Twitter bio to read: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nThunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Prize for her work raising awareness about climate change, has become an inspirational figure for fellow teens. Last month, she sailed from Europe to the United States on a zero-emission yacht.\n\nBefore her U.N. speech, Thunberg testified on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d who say climate change is real and that humans are responsible \u2014 conclusions that Trump has resisted.\n\n\u201cI want you to unite behind science,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cI want you to unite behind science. And then I want you to take action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not political views or my opinions,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is science.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "At an energy forum in Moscow, the Russian president dismissed the Swedish teenage climate activist\u2019s viral U.N. speech \u2014 and took a swipe at her parents.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.uwuon8H90x4xBGeAkULIw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ba16cbe0-e53e-11e9-87ab-05843fe25dc8", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
