REUTERS/Steve Marcus\n\n(Reuters) - Joe Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter for his U.S. presidential bid as he seeks the 2020 Democratic nomination, his campaign said on Thursday.\n\nThough the former vice president is one of the leading candidates for the nomination, his take lagged behind those of fellow presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, who raised $25.3 million and $19.1 million in the third quarter, respectively.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another top contender in polls, has not yet released her fundraising totals.\n\nIncumbent Republican President Donald Trump and his party, meanwhile, jointly raised $125 million for his 2020 reelection bid in the third quarter, the Republican National Committee said on Tuesday.\n\nFundraising numbers are closely watched to assess whether campaigns are collecting the cash needed to be competitive. They must file detailed fundraising reports for the third quarter to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cThe question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond,\u201d said Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz in a statement. \u201cOur campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said earlier on Thursday that it would spend $6 million on television and digital advertisements in the early voting states of the Democratic primary, which include Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The campaign has also hired dozens of staff members in those states.", "description": "Joe Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter for his U.S. presidential bid as he seeks the 2020 Democratic nomination, his campaign said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436808188&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921UY"}
