REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo\n\nNetanyahu said on Sunday he would make a final effort this week to reach an agreement and would likely meet with his challenger Benny Gantz on Wednesday after further negotiations between their parties.\n\nOn Sunday, Blue and White said it would \u201chold any meeting and spare no effort\u201d to form a broad unity government. But on Tuesday the party said conditions were not ripe yet to hold effective negotiations between the parties and their leaders.\n\nAn inconclusive ballot on Sept. 17, the second this year, has created a political deadlock and left Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister weakened.\n\nNetanyahu, facing a looming indictment on corruption allegations he denies, has failed to secure a clear election victory twice in six months. His right-wing Likud party came second with 32 seats in the 120-member parliament, against 33 for former military chief Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White party.\n\nThe parties\u2019 negotiators had met on Sunday without success, with each side blaming the other for the stalemate.\n\nWith neither party leader appearing able to put together a coalition with a ruling majority on his own, Israel\u2019s president last week tasked Netanyahu with forming the next government in the hope of securing a power-sharing deal between the Blue and White party and Likud.\n\nIf Netanyahu fails to clinch a deal, President Reuven Rivlin is then likely to ask Gantz to try to form a government, though he, like Netanyahu, also has no clear path to power.\n\nGantz has pledged not to serve in a government under a premier facing criminal charges. His party has accused Likud of stalling in the talks in the hope of triggering yet another election.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney-general is due to hold a pre-trial hearing this week on his announced intention to indict Netanyahu on fraud and bribery charges in three corruption cases.\n\nNetanyahu, who says he is a victim of a political witchhunt, can argue at the session against prosecution. A final decision by the attorney-general on an indictment is expected by the end of 2019.", "description": "Talks to form a national unity government in Israel hit a further snag on Tuesday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's centrist election rival called off a meeting with the embattled leader.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435971906&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9038E", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
