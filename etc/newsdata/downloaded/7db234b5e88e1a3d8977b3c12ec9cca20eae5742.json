Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history.\n\nThe WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision.", "description": "Single malts will face a 25% tariff in response to a row about subsidies for the aircraft maker Airbus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3B9A/production/_109085251_whiskies3_getty.jpg"}
