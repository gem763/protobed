The EEOC sued on Stephens' behalf in 2014.\n\nWhat they're saying: The administration argues that \"Title VII\u2019s protections apply fully to transgender individuals\" when it comes to sex discrimination \u2014 women being treated worse than men, or vice versa \u2014 but \"treating a transgender person less favorably than a non-transgender person\" is not part of the law's protections.\n\nIt says there is no \"evidence that the funeral home treated some or all biologically male employees less favorably than similarly situated biologically female employees.\"\n\nThe other side: \"Congress wrote a broad statute that prohibits all sex discrimination,\" Chase Strangio, part of Stephens' legal team at the ACLU and a transgender activist, tells Axios. \"When an employer fires someone for being transgender, no matter how sex is defined, that is discrimination because of sex.\"\n\nIn 2 other cases, which were argued together, the Trump administration says that Title VII doesn't cover discrimination based on sexual orientation. Both suits were filed by men who say they were fired for being gay.\n\nAn employer who discriminates against employees in same-sex relationships doesn't violate Title VII as long as it treats men and women in those relationships the same way, their argument says.\n\nYes, but: 69% of Americans \u2014 and 56% of Republicans \u2014 favor laws that would protect LGBTQ people from job and housing discrimination, a 2018 PRRI survey found.\n\nWhat to watch: This issue \u2014 alongside cases on abortion access, guns and immigration \u2014 will likely come to a head next summer before the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGo deeper: 2019's Supreme Court cases to watch", "description": "The White House has worked to undo many LGBTQ protections secured under President Obama.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/iDTnQjDIZT_EsXyw0Ve5L-itAvg=/0x250:5568x3382/1920x1080/2019/10/08/1570549194000.None", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
