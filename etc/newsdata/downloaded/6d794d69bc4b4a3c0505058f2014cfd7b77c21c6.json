As an African American, he was long excluded from many white-owned galleries. He forged his artistic identity during the postwar years in Paris, where black artists such as Beauford Delaney and writers including James Baldwin had sought escape from the rampant discrimination they found in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Clark was working in his studio in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris, he recounted, when he decided that the painting on which he was laboring called for an unusually wide brush. He found one in the janitor\u2019s closet. He would later dub his technique, in which he took a push broom to a canvas laid flat on the floor, \u201cthe big sweep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the push broom gives you, speed,\u201d he once told an interviewer. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s something psychological. It\u2019s like cutting through everything. It\u2019s also anger or something like it, to go through it in a big sweep.\u201d\n\nMr. Clark\u2019s paintings featured \u201call the colors of the spectrum,\u201d he once said in an interview at the P\u00e9rez Art Museum in Miami \u2014 from rich oranges, reds and purples to gentle pastels, sometimes in juxtaposition with one another. For some viewers, the sweeping lines formed by the bristles of his broom evoked the colorful strata of a sunset; for others they looked like waves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a tribute after his death, the publication Art News described his paintings as exuding \u201cthe rare and exquisite sense of having come instantly into being with just a few pushes of his broom. Their brash, joyous confidence comes from the tool\u2019s movement, but also from his unique sense for color \u2014 where, say, mint green, lava red, and aquamarine can hover together gloriously.\u201d\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ginger Baker, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nMany of his works featured ovals and shaped canvases, a practice that he was credited with helping to pioneer. He described his work as having a life of its own \u2014 \u201cyou just let it go,\u201d he said \u2014 and told the publication Black Renaissance Noire that he sometimes let galleries decide \u201cwhich way is up\u201d when they displayed a painting of his.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdward Clark Jr. was born on May 6, 1926, in New Orleans and grew up largely in Chicago.\n\nHe told Bomb magazine that his paternal grandmother, who was black, was 14 when she had his father, and that the baby\u2019s father was a white sheriff. Mr. Clark\u2019s father could \u201cpass\u201d as white, the artist said, but never wished to do so. He worked a variety of jobs, including construction work, and was fired from one of them when his employer discovered his race.\n\nMr. Clark described his mother as a devout Catholic, and he attended Catholic schools before leaving high school to enlist in the Army Air Forces during World War II. After serving in Guam, he began his formal art studies, first at the Art Institute of Chicago and later in Paris at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re.\n\nAD\n\nThe artistic ferment in Paris proved enormously invigorating for Mr. Clark. \u201cNew York in that moment was not considered the capital of the art world \u2014 it was Paris,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were all alive, man! Picasso, Braque, both of them. Everybody was there!\u201d He was also deeply inspired by Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl, a French painter of Russian origin who was known for the thick paint that he applied in his abstract works.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1957, Mr. Clark settled in New York \u2014 although he would return to Paris throughout his life \u2014 and helped form the Brata Gallery, a cooperative that showcased the works of a racially diverse group of artists. He traveled extensively for his artwork, including to the American Southwest, the Caribbean, Brazil, the Mediterranean, Africa and China, seeking new landscapes and shades of light to inspire him.\n\nMr. Clark\u2019s marriages to Muriel Nelson, Lola Owens, Hedy Durham and Liping An ended in divorce. Survivors include a daughter from his third marriage, Melanca Clark of Detroit, and two grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nDuring his formative years in Paris, Mr. Clark studied the Old Masters as well as modern art. But then as after, he was drawn inexorably to the abstract form.\n\n\u201cIt struck me that if I paint a person \u2014 no matter how I do it \u2014 it is a lie,\u201d he once remarked, according to the Art Institute of Chicago. \u201cThe truth is in the physical brushstroke and the subject of the painting is the paint itself.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He achieved his distinctive effect by using a janitor\u2019s broom to sweep paint across the canvas in giant, motion-filled strokes.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TYGKByDdJiVEaV9nqaJA-4iFYmI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2FQP22XVZ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
