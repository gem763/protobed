Four years after being central to chaos over a concession in Germany and two on from having to withdraw from the meeting of Europe and the US at the 11th hour, the Norwegian undertook media duties at Gleneagles almost bereft of her voice. Pettersen did not reveal what precisely her ailment is, nor what she has been prescribed for it, but all the available evidence was not good.\n\nThe Norwegian, a controversial pick for this contest having taken a break from competitive golf to have a child, insists she will be fine to compete here but she has been spared Friday morning\u2019s foursomes session.\n\n\u201cMy golf game is in great shape,\u201d the 38-year-old said. \u201cBeing here it feels like I never left the game, which is kind of nice. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the atmosphere, the energy or everything that Solheim is all about that always kind of brings out the best of all of us.\n\nEurope\u2019s Suzann Pettersen sorry for Solheim Cup \u2018concession\u2019 controversy Read more\n\n\u201cSo this time around the team atmosphere has been the best I think I\u2019ve ever been a part of. And it\u2019s fun to be around all these new youngsters who are so energetic and really good golfers. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just from here [the neck] up, so I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nCatriona Matthew, whose wildcard faith in Pettersen \u2013 she is outside the world\u2019s top 500 \u2013 raised eyebrows, is similarly relaxed about her player. \u201cShe said she is actually feeling pretty good, obviously she is just a little hoarse,\u201d said Europe\u2019s captain. \u201cShe is feeling good. Her caddie is probably quite happy about it; she isn\u2019t speaking so loudly.\u201d\n\nPettersen, who laughed when she was asked about the intensity of the battle and remarks made by America\u2019s Danielle Kang, said: \u201cWe are going to step on their necks.\u201d\n\nCarlota Ciganda and Bronte Law will lead Europe\u2019s bid to reclaim the cup in the opening match, against Morgan Pressel and Marina Alex. Georgia Hall will team up with C\u00e9line Boutier against the US\u2019s Lexi Thompson and Brittany Altomare. Caroline Masson and Jodi Ewart Shadoff feature in the penultimate foursomes tie with the Korda sisters, Jessica and Nelly. Charley Hull and Azahara Mu\u00f1oz take on the US pair of Megan Khang and Annie Park in the final match.\n\nJuli Inkster, the US captain, admitted she had to be convinced to allow siblings to team up for the first time in a Solheim Cup. \u201cThey asked me to play together,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too keen on it. But the more I thought about it, it would be stupid not to play them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often you have two sisters on one team. They should have the right to play together.\n\n\u201cThey are two really different personalities, even though their games are the same. I felt like I could put one on one side and one on the other side but they are strong together and wanted to play together.\u201d\n\nMatthew pointed towards the importance of Europe starting brightly. \u201cBeing the home side, if we can get off to a good start it would really get the crowd into it,\u201d the Scot said.", "description": "Europe\u2019s Suzann Pettersen said she was \u2018fine\u2019 but misses the morning foursomes while Jessica and Nelly Korda will make history as the first siblings in the competition", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dbb889ca3c22abb9b6dce4579264d245b5b2900/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0493a8dc52c304041f408e105aabf8a3", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
