(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA team of Trump administration officials toured a California facility once used by the Federal Aviation Administration this week as they searched for a potential site to relocate homeless people, according to three government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private tour.\n\nPresident Trump has directed aides to launch a major crackdown on homelessness in California, spurring an effort across multiple government agencies to determine how to deal with sprawling tent camps on the streets of Los Angeles and other cities, officials said.\n\nTrump is expected to visit California on Tuesday and Wednesday. One administration official with knowledge of Trump\u2019s visit to California said there were discussions about an announcement related to California\u2019s growing homeless problem next week, but a second official said that any decision could be premature and that it was not on the current schedule for the trip.\n\nTrump has asked aides to figure out \u201chow the hell we can get these people off the streets,\u201d one senior administration official said.\n\nThe FAA facility toured by administration officials is located in or near Los Angeles, but its precise name or whereabouts \u2014 or whether it is a current or former government facility \u2014 were not immediately known.\n\nIt also remains unclear how the federal government could accomplish getting homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles, or what legal authority officials would use to do so.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that the administration is considering razing tent camps, creating new temporary facilities or refurbishing government facilities as part of Trump\u2019s directive on homelessness. The changes would attempt to give the federal government a larger role in supervising housing and health care for residents.\n\nSome administration officials expressed skepticism that the federal government wanted to get in the business of operating a large homeless shelter in Los Angeles. There were also questions about the feasibility of turning the FAA facility into a shelter and how it could legally be done.\n\nOne administration official with knowledge of Trump\u2019s visit to California said there were discussions about a homelessness announcement next week.\n\nSenior administration officials said that forcing people into new facilities was not under consideration, with one official telling The Washington Post: \u201cWe\u2019re not rounding people up or anything yet. You guys in the media get too ahead of yourselves.\u201d\n\nThe administration delegation that visited the FAA site included members of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Justice Department.\n\nLos Angeles officials were blindsided by news of the sweeping plans being considered by the administration for the city\u2019s homeless population. Some had thought White House officials were arriving this week to simply learn more about the issues.\n\nThe administration\u2019s delegation divulged little information to city officials about what they were doing in Los Angeles when they were not with city representatives.\n\n\u201cThey were very cagey with us about what they were doing,\u201d said a Los Angeles city official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. \u201cOur only understanding from them coming into this was they wanted to poke around and learn more about what we were doing out here. All this stuff about cracking down and sweeping people out of skid row was a total surprise to us.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration team also met for an open-ended discussion about homelessness with the Los Angeles police union, according to an official with direct knowledge of the meeting, which was first reported by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAt that meeting Tuesday, administration officials asked how or if the federal government could help local authorities take homeless people off the streets of Los Angeles and into a sanitary place where they could access services including showers and meals. They also talked about a recent sweep made of the Tenderloin district in San Francisco, where there is a significant homeless population, the official said.\n\nAdministration officials also asked about the \u201cskid row\u201d section of Los Angeles, where homelessness has recently skyrocketed.\n\nCity officials gave a tour of the Jordan Downs housing project in Los Angeles on Tuesday to a team that included federal officials from Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Domestic Policy Council, the Justice Department and HUD, according to Branimir Kvartuc, spokesman for City Council member Joe Buscaino (D). About six city staffers and six federal officials were on that tour.\n\nThe administration team also visited the Los Angeles emergency response center for homelessness, a nonprofit housing developer and a homeless shelter in southern Los Angeles, according to a news release from Mayor Eric Garcetti (D).", "description": "President Trump has directed aides to launch a major crackdown on homelessness in California, spurring an effort across multiple government agencies to determine how to deal with sprawling tent camps on the streets of Los Angeles and other cities, officials said.", "authors": ["Jeff Stein", "Economic Policy Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "September At Pm", "Jeff Stein Is A Policy Reporter For The Washington Post.
