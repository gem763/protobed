Cory Booker said in a post-debate interview Thursday he can be a bit baffled by the way former Vice President Joseph R. Biden drones on and on in a debate setting, suggesting that should give voters pause in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cHe tends to go on sometimes \u2014 at one point he is talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players,\u201d Mr. Booker, who is black, said on CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I saw a record player in my community.\u201d\n\nThe comments came after a debate in which former Housing Secretary Julian Castro questioned whether Mr. Biden was losing his marbles when it came to his health care plan.\n\nWorries related to Mr. Biden\u2019s health have lingered over the race, but the 76-year-old has so far defied the naysayers and convinced enough Democrats \u2014 at least according to polls \u2014 that he is the best candidate to defeat President Trump.\n\nMr. Booker, after the debate, suggested he understands Mr. Castro\u2019s concerns about whether Mr. Biden can withstand a grueling campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of times that I have listened to Joe Biden over the years and often felt like there were times where he is going on or meandering in his speech,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether he believes Mr. Biden is too old to be president, Mr. Booker said \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
