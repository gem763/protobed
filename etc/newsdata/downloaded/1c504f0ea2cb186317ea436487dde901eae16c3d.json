Yet several newspapers reported that Trump pressured Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter. Just weeks earlier, Trump had suspended some $400 million in military aid to the nation, The Washington Post reported, raising suspicions that Trump may have used the withheld funds to leverage compliance with his request that would help his re-election.\n\nA complaint filed by an American whistleblower in the intelligence community last month reportedly involved a troubling \u201cpromise\u201d Trump had made to a foreign leader.The complaint has not been released to congressional leaders, who are demanding to see it. Trump is now referring to the whistleblower as a \u201cspy.\u201d\n\nTrump has alleged that Biden, while vice president, worked to shield a Ukrainian company linked to his son from a corruption probe. But a Ukrainian official said earlier this year that investigators found no evidence of any wrongdoing by Biden or his son. (The Ukrianian foreign minister said Saturday \u201cI don\u2019t think pressure was used in call to Zelensky.\u201d)\n\nThe latest revelations have triggered calls to impeach Trump if he indeed wielded U.S. might to mobilize a foreign power against U.S. citizens to impact an American election. Biden has called Trump\u2019s acts an \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t denied he discussed Biden with Zelensky, and told reporters Friday: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what was discussed.\u201d\n\nSchaub sees lack of action against Trump as a death watch for democracy.\n\nOur Lady of She Had a Good Run hospital, where our republic's on death watch, is administered by Senators who love power more than they love America. Our electoral process is what makes us a republic, and they're fine with Trump soliciting a foreign power to harm it. #betrayal \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 21, 2019\n\nWhat part of pressuring a foreign government to attack our elections don't you get? This should be the show stopper, for crying out loud. \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 21, 2019\n\nStop, you partisans, you justifiers of malfeasance, you power-drunk politicians trading love of country for fealty to the corrupter. Elections can\u2019t keep us free if you let him solicit foreign interference. Unblind your eyes, unplug your ears, open your mouths and call it enough! https://t.co/CylKRSdFXM \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 21, 2019\n\nTRUMP SOLICITED FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION AGAIN \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 21, 2019\n\nSeems clear he extorted them, likely even offered a quid pro quo. But it's not necessary to show he extorted them or offered a quid pro quo. The man used his high office to solicit foreign election interference. If that's not enough, let's drop the pretense of being a republic. \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 21, 2019\n\nIndeed. Yesterday, he called the whistle-blower a \"partisan.\" Today his word is \"spy.\" That's an admission that the whistle-blower's report is true. Trump must've learned there's corroborating evidence, so he's pivoted to trying to destroy the whistle-blower. This will get ugly. https://t.co/AoK7MEKA72 \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) September 22, 2019\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this in my lifetime,\u201d William Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution, told The Washington Post. Trump \u201cappears to be daring the rest of the political system to stop him \u2014 and if it doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll go further.\u201d", "description": "\"And some of the hospital staff are trying to smother it with a pillow,\" warns Walter Schaub.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d86dbdd230000d000d3b928.jpeg?cache=03mbia7ntc&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
