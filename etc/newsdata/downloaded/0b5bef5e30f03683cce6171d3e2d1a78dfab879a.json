I wish we did, my auntie and uncle are in their late forties and have no enemies at all. The police are treating it as targeted.\n\n'I managed to see one of them and they are like 14 or around that. They have definitely been paid to do it; little kids don't tend to course damage without someone paying them or something.\n\n'There has been loads of stress caused because of this. They have damaged courtesy car, roof and front bumper.\n\n'The house windows have been replaced multiple times. The amount we have spent is into the thousands. Dogs on edge, cars damaged, windows damaged.'\n\nHe initially posted on October 15, writing: 'Video of people damaging car! Also smashed top Window!\n\n'Any evidence anyone can give would be great!

Two people can be seen hurtling more rocks at the household.\n\nSmashing the window they had previously smashed two nights before and a ground floor window.\n\nAgain, the duo quickly make an escape down the street.\n\nThe 28-year-old posted footage of each attack to Facebook shortly after they happened in Scholes, West Yorkshire, with the latest incident taking place on Friday\n\nThe third video shows what appears to be two teenage boys throwing rocks at the home, however this time the two managed to escape without smashing any windows.\n\nThe collection of posts has been met with extreme disgust from the local community, with many showing support for Liam and his family.\n\nLiam also criticised how the police were handling the incident. He added: 'They don't seem to be bothered if I am honest.\n\n'It's happened three times in the last two weeks and they just come and look and give a crime number.
