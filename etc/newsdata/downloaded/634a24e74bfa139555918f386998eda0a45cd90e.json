(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThanks to a very unscientific 1896 survey, only children have been called a disease and maligned as spoiled, selfish and narcissistic.\n\nAnd German researchers said previous studies haven't helped. Even if they were attempting to debunk assumptions, the studies have not gone deep enough. They either did not include a large enough sample or didn't make allowances for variables such as gender and socioeconomic status.\n\nBut a recent study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science provides definitive proof only children need to stop the persistent generalization that they are narcissistic and interested only in themselves.\n\n\"We can now say with rather high confidence that only children are not substantially more narcissistic than people with siblings,\" said psychologist Michael Dufner from the University of Leipzig in Germany.\n\nOnly children believe the stereotype, too\n\nNarcissist? If she's an only child, both other only children and people with siblings think she is, researchers found. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe research was conducted by the University of Leipzig and the University of M\u00fcnster and looked at 556 adults with an average age of 46. The participants were a mix of only children and those with siblings.\n\nThey completed an online survey and the findings concluded that both only children and those with siblings believed that only children are more narcissistic.\n\nIn a separate experiment, researchers analyzed responses from 1,810 individuals \u2013233 only children and 1,577 with siblings. The study focused on two personality traits used to measure narcissism: feelings of self-admiration and being more prone to rivalry.\n\nThe personality traits were no higher in only children than they were in people with siblings.\n\nResearchers said their study does not support parents having more children to assure that their only child does not grow up to be a narcissist.\n\n\"When sociologists, economists or policy makers discuss the downsides of low fertility rates, they should let go of the idea that growing up without siblings leads to increased narcissism,\" Dufner said. \"There might, of course, be economic or societal costs associated with low birth rates, but increasing narcissism in the upcoming generation does not seem to be a factor that is relevant to the discussion.\"\n\nREAD\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/20/only-children-not-more-narcissistic-than-people-siblings-study-says/4048043002/", "description": "A German study found that only children are no more narcissistic than those with siblings.
