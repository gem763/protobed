American and Russian visitors were reportedly given the highest priority, especially lawyers and those working in media.\n\nAlso on rt.com Spanish security firm spied on Assange 24/7, reveals plan to smuggle him to Russia or Cuba \u2013 report\n\nAll guests were required to hand over phones and computers to embassy security before entering the compound, potentially giving Undercover Global \u2013 and, in turn, US intelligence \u2013 access to any files stored on the devices.\n\nInterest in Assange\u2019s meetings with Russians may have been piqued by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which accused the cyber activist of cooperating with Russian intelligence to leak Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, among other pilfered documents, prior to the 2016 US election \u2013 a claim Assange has fervently denied and which the DOJ has never backed up with evidence.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Julian Assange\u2019s life is at risk\u2019: Pamela Anderson urges UK to free WikiLeaks co-founder\n\nMorales also allegedly provided US intelligence with audio and video of meetings between Assange and his staff, lawyers and other associates, El Pais reported previously. A Spanish high court has launched a probe into the matter following the newspaper\u2019s revelations.\n\nAssange was arrested in April, after Ecuador rescinded his asylum status and allowed British police to remove him from the embassy on charges related to a skipped 2012 bail hearing. The activist sought refuge in the embassy nearly seven years prior, fearing he would be ultimately extradited to the United States and tried for his role in publishing classified material, including leaks revealing the scale of the US\u2019s secret lethal drone program, among other things.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
