Francis got away with it at the time \u2013 equally remarkable was that it was not a penalty, nor reviewed to the TMO \u2013 and although it was not as bad as that of the USA\u2019s John Quill, which led to the first red card of the tournament. It is likely the citing commissioner will take a close look given the contact made with Hooley\u2019s head.\n\nHad the referee Nic Berry \u2013 whose own career was ended due to concussion \u2013 felt compelled to act given World Rugby\u2019s public criticism of officials, England would have had a far more trying evening here. Francis, it must be said, performed well thereafter but Eddie Jones had warned his players in no uncertain terms beforehand not to try too hard to make an impact. It is unlikely, then, that Jones would have been too impressed.\n\nCokanasiga helps England crush USA as Quill sees World Cup\u2019s first red card Read more\n\n2 Ford\u2019s control showed he\u2019s the right fly-half to face Argentina\n\nIf we are looking to glean who might have impressed sufficiently to win a place in the side to face Argentina on Saturday week look no further than George Ford. It may seem obvious given he started against Tonga as well but it is not so long ago that Owen Farrell was installed as Eddie Jones\u2019s No 1 fly-half. Henry Slade is also expected to be fit to face Argentina so Jones will probably consider reverting to Farrell in the No 10 jersey.\n\nHe should resist, however. Ford enjoyed somewhat of an armchair ride given the dominance of the England pack but the fly-half was in total control, exploiting the front foot ball his eight provided him with. Ford and Owen Farrell were both guilty of kicking aimlessly against Tonga but the former was far more accurate against the USA. There was an invention to it as well and one lovely outside-of-the-boot flick eventually led to his opening try and a delightful shimmy to put the excellent Lewis Ludlam away.\n\n3 Humidity not always at root of England\u2019s handling errors in attack\n\nThe handling errors were not eradicated, nor were the discipline problems in the opening 20 minutes, but this was a much more emphatic performance from England, based around their utterly dominant pack and again a heavy reliance on their kicking game. And bearing in mind that Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Sam Underhill and Kyle Sinckler were all absent from the starting eight it was some statement from England\u2019s forwards.\n\nThey will face harder examinations to come but the driving maul was a weapon the USA had no answer to. Defensively England look rock solid too, but the attack coach Scott Wisemantel may be a little displeased because England were at times wasteful in the opening 50 minutes \u2013 Jonathan Joseph\u2019s failure to find Joe Cokanasiga at the very end of the first half springs to mind \u2013 and the extreme humidity can only partially mitigate against 18 handling errors. Cokanasiga made three of those alone and though he scored two tries, it is hard to see him displacing Jonny May as England move through the gears against Argentina and then France.\n\n4 Shambolic finale certain to infuriate defence coach Mitchell\n\nLike the golfer who makes 17 straight birdies, pars the last and walks off the course furious with himself, England were left with a decidedly sour taste in the mouth after shipping their first try in three matches with the clock gone red. They chose not to kick the ball out to bring an end to the match after the unmistakable gong that has been introduced to this tournament. Yet while that in itself is perfectly fine, the manner in which chaos ensued thereafter is surely not in the eyes of their defence coach John Mitchell.\n\nHe would have every right to be livid at the shambolic nature of Bryce Campbell\u2019s try, all the more so because he coached the USA between 2016 and 2017. It didn\u2019t have any bearing on the match and it may seem minor, but it was sloppy and was a brief glimpse of what can happen when this England side go off script.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bryce Campbell\u2019s late consolation for the USA came following an error-strewn passage of play, which England had several opportunities to end. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\n5 USA\u2019s shortcomings show need for tier-one nations to visit\n\nGary Gold may have struck a defeatist tone when the USA coach declared on the eve of the match that England had no discernable weaknesses but on the night it must be said his side were poor, albeit comprehensively overpowered by a side with more than enough resources to make light of the four-day turnaround. Gold also urged tier-one nations to tour tier-two countries in July on a more regular basis in order to improve their fortunes.\n\nHe gets his wish in 2021 when an England squad without their British & Irish Lions will play in the USA and the hope must be that more countries follow suit. There is an eagerness within rugby\u2019s corridors of power to try and break the American market and it would be no surprise at all to see the 2027 or perhaps more likely the 2031 World Cup staged there. On the field there is plenty of work to do first, however.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u2019s side learned plenty from their second Rugby World Cup match \u2013 including the need to play beyond the gong", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeab2970eca4d9606f1e18f1fe9426ed5a9ee211/0_4_4023_2414/master/4023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31e6c13922b1dea36c9b4b0ee7f7e7cb", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
