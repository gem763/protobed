There is no moral equivalence between China and Nazi Germany. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing to say and it\u2019s damaging to the relationship.\n\nLambasting China over its emissions might impress the US but it could be costly for Australia | Frank Jotzo Read more\n\n\u201cIf you ask the question \u2013 has the relationship been managed well from an Australian point of view over the last six months \u2013 the answer is that it has been managed terribly,\u201d Marles said.\n\n\u201cThere is complete ineptness on the part of this government, and that is a matter of concern for everybody in this country who is engaged in the export to China, and everybody in this country who benefits from that \u2013 and we\u2019re talking about millions of Australians in that category.\u201d\n\nHe said the government needed to do more to address the trust deficit between the two countries, saying joint defence exercises was one way this was occurring.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have a massive trust deficit in terms of our relationship with China, and we need to build trust,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re engaging, then we need to be having the best relationship with China that we possibly can have. And right now, this government is not delivering it. In fact, they\u2019re inept.\u201d\n\nBut he also said Australia needed to be able to raise issues of concern, such as human rights issues, within that relationship.", "description": "Richard Marles accuses PM of taking \u2018pot shots against our largest trading partner\u2019 amid US-China tensions", "authors": ["Sarah Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328b113c9a32a40fbe2cdc02163b63ede11c5291/0_190_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cae7b4261bf68ae2c6160588cc42338d", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
