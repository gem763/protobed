People share their hilarious last-minute efforts they put together", "language": "en", "text": "Halloween is a great excuse to get dressed up, but not all of us have the luxury of time to put together an impressive costume - or are organising enough to order one online.\n\nIf you're stuck for inspiration ahead of October 31, take a look at these hilarious home-made efforts put together at the last minute by Reddit users from across the world.\n\nCollated by social mobile insurance provider so-sure, these 10 cheap and cheerful creations should take you no longer than three hours to cobble together.\n\nIf you're on a budget and off to a spooky celebration this week, these are certain to raise a smile - and you won't feel bad if they don't survive the night.\n\nThis clever 'social butterfly' costume is completely customisable, you can choose the social apps to your heart's delight. A couple of basics like Facebook or Instagram wouldn't go amiss so that guests 'get it', but after that, you can have as much fun with the apps as you please\n\nThe social butterfly What to buy/find: Black leggings or tight black jeans and a black long sleeve shirt Children's butterfly wings from a costume store or Pound store Printed app logos Some antennae if you're feeling fancy. Use a headband, pom poms, and pipe cleaners. Cellotape. Method: Put on the black clothes. Tape the app logos all over your clothes using cellotape. Put on your wings. Antennae - Tape two pipe cleaners to a headband, and then tape pom-poms to the top of those pipe cleaners.\n\nEven guests who have never played a video game should recognise this one - the Nude Sim! We don't recommend actually going nude - some tight-fitting clothing that matches your skin shade should do the trick\n\nThe Nude Sim What to find/buy: Sheet of cardboard large enough to cover your torso and thighs Paint that matches your skin shade but is also slightly darker White paint Green paper A headband Wire or two/three pipe cleaners Elastic string Cellotape and glue Method: Match the cardboard to your body size. Pencil in a grid across the cardboard and cut a few random squares along the edges. Inside each square, randomly paint a selection of your near skin shade paint colour, mixed with varying amounts of white. This should create a \u201cblurry\u201d effect. Some very light, some closer to the original shade, and everything in between. Connect elastic string around your neck and waist. Use a 'Plumbob' (that green thing above your head) papercraft tutorial for your green paper. There are many examples online. Attach the Plumbob to the wire, or wind the pipe cleaners together to create a stronger length. Attach this to your headband.\n\nEver wanted to pretend you were a delicious hazelnut treat while offering fellow party guests the same delicious hazelnut treat? Now\u2019s your chance! This Ferrero Rocher costume isn't the easiest of the bunch, but the pay off of gasps from your adoring fans may be worth it\n\nThe Ferrero Rocher What to buy/find: Large cardboard box, big enough to cover your torso as if you were wearing the box (for the sphere) Roll of masking tape Gold paper or, in a pinch, normal white paper (for the wrapper) Brown paper (for the paper tray) Gold paint or gold spraypaint - whichever you think takes the least amount of time to dry according to the time you have available A box of Ferrero Rochers Method: Make a geodesic half dome with the box - which is triangles that all connect to make a sphere. There are templates online which you can print out and size up for your box/torso size. Once you've cut out your template and traced the same template onto the box, cut that out, stick it together with masking tape and overlay the tape multiple times until it's stable enough to last a few hours. Cut out a hole for your head out of two or three of the top triangles and tape again around the rim to make strong. Cover and tape the sphere in gold paper (or paper you've painted gold) Tape a long line of brown paper together and fold it into a concertina - ensuring the full folded length is enough to match the diameter of the Ferrero Rocher. Paint two gold lines around it, and once dry, stick it to the base of your golden sphere. Stick your head in the top hole, your arms out the bottom and viola.\n\nHelp your friends find their way home after a long night of partying with the Google Maps look. This is another one that\u2019ll take under an hour to make and should cost no more than a fiver\n\nThe Google Map What to buy/find: Yellow masking tape Pink cardboard Red marker Fabric glue A grey jumper or T-shirt Elastic strips - long enough to fit around your head Pencil Scissors Method: Draw a teardrop shape on your cardboard and draw an oval shape big enough for your own face in the middle. Cut the tear drop and the section in the middle out. Using your pencil, draw a border around the edge of the teardrop, on the outside and in the middle. Now colour the border in with a red marker. Take the yellow tape and stick it onto your shirt to create the streets. Now find some blue and white car signs online and print them off - about eight to 10. Think of five or six street names you want on your map, type them out and print them off too. Stick the street names on the yellow tape and the cars wherever you want them to be. Next, print a big letter A and a letter B and stick them on the red location signs. And finally, make two small holes on either side of the hole where your face is going to go, thread the elastic through and tie knots in each end to keep it in place.\n\nA sweet treat appropriate for Halloween!

The Banksy can be done in under an hour and you don't need much more than some old threads and a few spray cans. Almost like a real artist\n\nThe Banksy What to buy/find: A bunch of flowers Black trainers, or better yet, old black trainers A black hoodie A pair of white trousers - pre-loved if you can Small tube of black and white water-based paint Masking tape Cans of spray paint, empty or full, depending on how Banksy you want to be. Method: Use the masking tape to create the jagged shapes you want on your trousers. Paint the sections you've marked off with your black paint. Now do the same on the black hoodie, and use the masking tape to make the shapes you want on the sleeves. Now paint the sections of your hoodie with the white paint. Remember to wait for the paint to dry before taking the masking tape off. Before putting your outfit on, ruffle the two garments together so the paint transfers to the opposite colour to create that worn-out look. Hood up, flowers in the one hand and spray can in the other and you're a Banksy on the move!", "description": "If you're stuck for inspiration ahead of October 31, take a look at these hilarious home-made efforts put together at the last minute by Reddit users from across the world.", "authors": ["Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/14/20282564-0-image-a-256_1572274466637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
