Not our world, thankfully, but the world of Fortnite, which was sucked into a black hole, taking the whole game and all player characters with it. If you try to load Fortnite today, you\u2019ll be presented with a blank screen. When developer Epic Games called the finale of Fortnite Season 10 \u201cThe End\u201d, it wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nOK, before confused parents start celebrating, let\u2019s be clear: Fortnite will be back, it\u2019s just that Epic has closed out the first chapter of the game, which has amassed 250 million players since the launch of its Battle Royale mode in September 2017. And amid all the hype, hysteria and controversy that has surrounded the gigantically successful title over the past two years, one aspect has been overlooked outside its fanbase: this has been one of the most innovative story experiments of the decade.\n\nThere is no conventional \u201cnarrative\u201d to Fortnite Battle Royale \u2013 Epic doesn\u2019t provide an origin story for its endless 100-player wars, it doesn\u2019t give us long cinematic scenes with characters explaining the world, the factions and the plot. Instead, Fortnite is split into a series of three-month-long seasons, each with a climactic event that suggests some kind of interdimensional struggle taking place over the future of the game\u2019s isolated island locale.\n\nThe plot began in Season Three when players noticed space rocks hitting the surface of the island as they played. Season Four opened with a huge meteor crash, which destroyed the Dusty Depot area of the map, and then at the close of the season, a rocket flew out of the impact site in a live, in-game event visible to all players online at the time \u2013 an incredible technical achievement, and a fascinating new way to tell stories within a massively multiplayer universe.\n\nFrom here, each season brought some new anomaly to the world, including giant alien cubes and vast volcanoes, all seemingly part of a fissure in space-time. But players were never told exactly what was going on \u2013 everything played out through dramatic season events, and clever little environmental storytelling features, such as in-game television screens suddenly showing countdowns, and new scenic features such as impenetrable bunkers appearing in the woods, with no explanation.\n\nThrough this system of events and signs, a kind of narrative economy emerged between players. Fans took to Reddit forums in their millions to discuss findings and theorise over what the latest signals could mean. These theories were focused and amplified by the game\u2019s biggest YouTube players \u2013 especially Fortnite superstar Ninja \u2013 who made videos, picking through clues they and other players had found in the landscape.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beginning of the end \u2026 a rocket bursts from the earth.

When you have a world that players are free to explore, it makes sense to fill that world with story-enhancing elements, rewarding players for having a good look round. Hidden audiotapes, emails and scrolls are a familiar element of action adventure titles such as Assassin\u2019s Creed, Mass Effect and Grand Theft Auto. But these are grand, single-player experiences, where narrative discovery is a key element.\n\nFortnite Battle Royale, on the other hand, is a multiplayer online game where players interact with the world in discrete 20-minute sessions. Ostensibly, there\u2019s no need for a narrative \u2013 Epic could, in theory, retain player interest simply by making sure there is a steady supply of new dance moves, costumes and scenic features to enjoy. Instead, the studio has built a vast functional universe in which an alien known as The Visitor is attempting to mend the space-time fissure around the island, and communicated this through systems of signs, signals and miracles \u2013 sort of like the Medieval Christian church. Indeed, it\u2019s interesting how Fortnite has co-opted a lot of religious symbolism into the game\u2019s suggestive narrative, from comets trailing across the sky, to the decidedly apocalyptic imagery of fire, brimstone and global destruction.\n\nFor Season 10, Epic was always building toward something vast and catastrophic and upped the narrative signalling accordingly. Throughout the last months players have been able to find audiotapes hidden around the map in which The Visitor has made recordings about his attempts to fix a loop in time and prevent a singularity. It sounds like the ravings of a conspiracy theorist, echoing back the most extreme theories from the fanbase itself.\n\nAnd then in the game\u2019s final moments on Sunday evening, a giant explosion took place, sucking the world into a black vortex, leaving players stunned and confused. Brilliantly, Epic took the explosion out of the \u201cfiction\u201d of the game, so that the menu pages and user interface were also pulled into the black hole. Players who looked up the game\u2019s server status found the narrative had even extended here:\n\nHelen \ud83c\udf83 (@HelenAngel) Mad props to everyone on the @FortniteGame team for the brilliant execution of this season\u2019s end. I really appreciate the little details like the server status (see picture below). This STW player is excited to see what\u2019s next! \ud83d\ude0a #Fortnite #FortniteChapter2 pic.twitter.com/jGHnJLlMfb\n\nFortnite has been criticised as a shallow, cynical machine of compulsion, its trendy dances and outlandish outfits a means of ensnaring younger players. But as a purveyor of new forms of storytelling, in which the community is left to construct its own narrative based around subtle semiotic systems and climactic events, it is a fascinating innovator.\n\nIn many ways, video-game storytelling is still young. The artform is barely 40 years old as a mass medium \u2013 compare that to the movie business (taking the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 Cin\u00e9matographe as our start point), which was only just getting into era of colour after four decades. We have seen the rise of massively multiplayer adventures such as World of Warcraft, where global arching narratives are woven into the largely player-directed quests, and we have seen plenty of interesting live story experiments, such as the mostly single-player adventure Dark Souls allowing players to leave messages to each other within the game.\n\nBut Fortnite is playing with storytelling concepts, tropes and systems while also providing a piece of blockbuster entertainment for millions of mostly teenage players. It\u2019s like a new Marvel superhero movie being performed entirely in interpretive dance.\n\nWhen Chapter 2 inevitably begins, bringing a new landscape with new gameplay features, it will be interesting to see where Epic goes next on its somewhat transgressive storytelling odyssey. It is, after all, quite hard to top the end of the world as a narrative device.", "description": "Season 10 of Fortnite climaxed in apocalyptic fashion \u2013 sucking gamers into a black hole.
