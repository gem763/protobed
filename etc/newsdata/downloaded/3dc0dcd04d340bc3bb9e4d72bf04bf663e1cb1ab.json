The World War II warning against careless talk carries a personal meaning for the beleaguered president. \u00adBeset by a hostile media and a ruthless opposition party, Trump now must be careful about every word he says, privately and publicly.\n\nThe walls, including those in the White House, have ears.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat was demonstrated in spades last week, most dramatically by the allegations from a CIA officerthat Trump used a phone call with the president of Ukraine to solicit foreign help in the 2020 campaign.

Before he left the United Nations Thursday, Trump attended a private event to thank the new American ambassador, Kelly Craft, and her staff for their work during the General \u00adAssembly session.\n\nSome privacy.

Efforts to end his presidency, one way or another, have reached a fever pitch, and Trump would be foolish to assume they will fail. His margin for error is approximately zero.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN'S COLUMN IN THE NEW YORK POST\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL GOODWIN", "description": "The walls, including those in the White House, have ears.", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/28/694940094001_6090287564001_6090293338001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
