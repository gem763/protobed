The new policy applies worldwide, not just in the U.S., and to issue ads as well as ads run by specific political campaigns.\n\nTwitter's ban, per the company, will go into effect Nov. 22, with details on the policy to be released Nov. 15.\n\nFacebook has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks for allowing President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and its supporters to run advertisements on the platform that assert, without evidence, a corrupt relationship between former Vice President Joseph Biden and the government of Ukraine.\n\nBiden\u2019s presidential campaign has condemned Facebook for permitting deliberately misleading advertisements, including one that CNN had rejected due to its inaccuracy. Other Democratic candidates, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have also strongly criticized Facebook\u2019s approach \u2014 one the company has defended by arguing that it should not be a gatekeeper for political speech online.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also repeatedly rejected calls for an all-out ban on political ads on his company's platform, arguing that the ads are an important way for emergent politicians to reach would-be voters.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1154915188-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
