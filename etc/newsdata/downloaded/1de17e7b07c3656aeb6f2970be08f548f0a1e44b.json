He\u2019s resurrected the myth that Democrats planted a spy inside his 2016 presidential campaign. And he\u2019s promulgated the idea that the whistleblower is a partisan operative and part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d of federal government employees out to get him. (The whistleblower reportedly is an intelligence officer, who Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence has said \u201cacted in good faith.\u201d)\n\nData, evidence and repeated assurances from Trump\u2019s own national security leaders do not appear to influence Trump as he searches for ways to undermine Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings and the presidential bid of a leading rival, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2026\n\nFormer administration officials say they\u2019ve never been sure if Trump actually believes these theories, or simply sees them an effective political tool to silence critics, batter Democratic rivals and appeal to a slice of his base. His passionate and relentless effort to push the theories suggests the former; his long-running birther lie suggests the latter.\n\n\u201cI just think he keeps up the game,\u201d a former senior administration official said. \u201cIt is much easier to have a conspiracy theory than have to deal with the facts. He and facts have a severe dislike for each other. He and facts don\u2019t get along. If you are not going to get along with facts and you have an administration known for lying, then everything becomes a conspiracy theory.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
