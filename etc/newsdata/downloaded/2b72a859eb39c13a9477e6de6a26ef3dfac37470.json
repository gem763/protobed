We should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality,\u201d said Mr Grassley, who represents Iowa.\n\n\u201cNo one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts.\u201d\n\nThe comments from Mr Grassley, 86, are significant, given his seniority in the party. While few Republicans have spoken out openly either in support of the efforts by Democrats to push ahead with an impeachment probe, or to condemn Mr Trump\u2019s often aggressive rhetoric, many have indicated they are unhappy about the allegation he sought to interfere in the 2020 election.\n\nAs the most senior Republican in the senate in terms of service, Mr Grassley was this year named president pro tempore of the Senate for the 116th session of Congress, a move that puts him third in the presidential line of succession, behind the vice president and the speaker of the House.\n\nHis comment is also significant given that he previously appeared to question whether the member of the US intelligence community who had filed the formal complaint, was truly a whistleblower.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Complaints based on second-hand information should not be rejected out of hand, but they do require additional leg work to get at the facts and evaluate the claim\u2019s credibility.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans who have voiced concerned about the accusations include senators Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse. Mr Sasse, who had a chance to examine the complaint as a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said \u201cthere\u2019s obviously lots that\u2019s very troubling here\u201d.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s public comments that he wants to meet the whistleblower and is trying to unmask them, led the intelligence officer\u2019s lawyers to express \u201cserious concerns\u201d, in a letter they sent to acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.\n\nLawyer Andrew Bakaj said \u201cthe events of the past week have heightened our concerns that our client\u2019s identity will be disclosed publicly and that, as a result, our client will be put in harm\u2019s way\u201d. He also claimed \u201ccertain individuals have issued a $50,000 bounty for any information relating to our client\u2019s identity\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "A top Republican politician has demanded protections for the CIA whistleblower, amid efforts by Donald Trump to identify them.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/12/grassley-protect.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
