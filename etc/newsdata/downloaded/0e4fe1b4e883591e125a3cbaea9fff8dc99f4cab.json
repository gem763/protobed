They were leaving that ridiculous apartment and we knew they wouldn\u2019t return. In our minds, we knew they\u2019d be there for us when the rain started to fall, but we didn\u2019t need it reiterated in a reboot.\n\nWe sort of needed to know where Jesse was (Picture: Ben Rothstein / Netflix)\n\nAnd up until quite recently, we were so fine with that.\n\nSo why are we now hellbent on bringing them back, with the actors who have moved on in the 15 years since plagued by questions on its potential return week after week.\n\nThat picture Jennifer Aniston posted to Instagram with the rest of the cast didn\u2019t help things.\n\nJust because other franchises are rebooting around it, whether rightly or wrongly, it doesn\u2019t mean Friends has to.\n\nEl Camino was a welcome accoutrement to Breaking Bad\u2019s finale. We knew where Walt (Bryan Cranston) ended up (sad face) but when it came to Jesse (Aaron Paul), the spinoff served to continue his story. And it worked brilliantly. It wasn\u2019t necessary, but it was welcome.\n\nWhen it comes to Friends, there is nothing necessary about a reboot other than to satisfy our own selfish minds, unimaginative in coming to our own conclusions on where the characters are in 2019.\n\nEl Camino brought back characters that had more to tell, the story more to show; we truly didn\u2019t know where Jesse ended up immediately after the final scene. With the cast of Friends, we don\u2019t NEED to know where they ended up and anything that is presented to us is only going to disappoint so many anyway.\n\nStop trying to make a film reboot happen\u2026it\u2019s not going to happen (Picture: NBC Universal, Inc.)\n\nIf the writers of Game Of Thrones can\u2019t ruddy get the finale right, what hopes do the showrunners of Friends have in creating a film that will make millions of viewers content?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the six lead actors recently reunited, Jennifer, who played Rachel Green, was asked by Howard Stern whether they were chatting a reunion.\n\nShe said she \u2018would be nothing without [the show]\u2019, but even Jen was hesitant to confirm they were getting back together.\n\n\u2018I honestly think\u2026we would love it\u2026there is an idea if there is a reboot of the show it won\u2019t be even close to as good as what it was. It would ruin it,\u2019 she said, agreeing the legacy of the show was important.\n\nWhoop, there it is: common sense.\n\nJennifer\u2019s comments come just months after Adam Sandler publicly called on her to make a \u2018f***ing Friends movie\u2019.\n\n\u2018Friends was a powerhouse,\u2019 added Adam, speaking to People. \u2018Everybody on Friends is excellent, everybody likes them. America, the world loves the cast.\u2019\n\nThis is fan-baiting at its very best, but many may argue no one should take winning film advice from Adam Sandler\u2026\n\nWith all this talk of a Clueless reboot, Home Alone reboot, Jay And Silent Bob reboot, a flippin\u2019 Barney reboot, the over-saturation of old classics getting the 2019 treatment is getting tired.\n\nI\u2019ll run the risk of having Barney ruined for me, but Friends stands to lose something a little more special if it\u2019s brought back with a one-off film special that languishes in our mighty expectations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s leave it in the 00s, where it well and truly belongs.\n\nIn other news, won\u2019t there be egg on my face if Friends makes a successful film reboot\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
