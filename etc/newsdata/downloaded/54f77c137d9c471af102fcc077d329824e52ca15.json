It was unclear whether Atkinson would share his full report with the committee, but Democrats were insisting on it.\n\nAtkinson returned to Capitol Hill as House Democrats intensify their impeachment inquiry against Trump, issuing subpoenas for witness testimony and documents to better understand Trump\u2019s efforts to solicit foreign assistance to damage Joe Biden, a potential rival in 2020.\n\nIf the committee obtains all of parts of Atkinson\u2019s report, Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry could speed up dramatically. In the meantime, the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight panels have been investigating Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky and the extent to which State Department officials were assisting Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, who was in contact with Ukrainian officials regarding Biden.\n\nFriday is also the deadline for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to comply with a subpoena for documents related to State Department officials\u2019 involvement with Giuliani as he sought to coordinate his efforts with Ukrainian officials.\n\nAtkinson said the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was both urgent and credible, but Trump and his allies have sought to undermine the whistleblower\u2019s credibility by asserting that the individual did not have first-hand knowledge of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHowever, Acting Director Joseph Maguire told lawmakers last week that the complaint was \u201cin alignment\u201d with the rough transcript of the call, and whistleblower complaints do not require first-hand knowledge of the events in question. In a statement earlier this week, Atkinson pushed back on those claims, saying the whistleblower \u201cstated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information.\u201d\n\nWhistleblower protection laws require that a complaint be turned over to Congress when the inspector general deems it \u201curgent,\u201d as Atkinson did in this case. But Maguire withheld the complaint from the House and Senate intelligence committees after consulting with the Justice Department and the White House Counsel\u2019s office.\n\nAtkinson opposed Maguire\u2019s decision and later briefed the Intelligence Committee. But he was unable to discuss the substance of the complaint during that briefing because Maguire had not yet authorized it to be released.\n\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said Atkinson\u2019s briefing before his panel last week was \u201cextremely helpful at trying to fill in some of the things we haven't been able to pickup from published documents.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f5/9e/179295864586ac7cc96cfb691462/191004-michael-atkinson-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
