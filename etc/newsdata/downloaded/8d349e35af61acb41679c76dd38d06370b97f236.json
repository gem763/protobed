(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nTrump\u2019s speech was a virtuoso performance, showing off the man in full. But the overriding theme to the pudding was that there is only Trump.\n\nTwo years ago, at the dawn of the Trump administration, Kellyanne Conway predicted that 2017\u2019s CPAC would really be TPAC, or \u201cTrump Pac.\u201d What was premature spin then is conventional wisdom now.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference has always been what the great historian Daniel Boorstin called a \u201cpseudo-event.\u201d It has no formal role within our politics and no binding power outside of it. It\u2019s part trade show, part infomercial, part convention for the various tribes of the Right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was invited to speak at CPAC this year, which is a good sign given that I\u2019m not exactly beloved by MAGA Nation these days. I passed. Still, I don\u2019t begrudge conservatives attending CPAC, nor do I think that going amounts to an endorsement or rejection of the president and his ideas.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been to CPAC, you know it\u2019s a bit like a right-wing Comic-Con, albeit with marginally fewer cosplayers. Some go to be part of the show, others just to take it all in. No one expects everybody dressed as Marvel\u2019s Thor to endorse DC\u2019s Superman.\n\nBut to the extent that CPAC is an infomercial for what the organizers want to sell as conservatism today, it really was TPAC, with the commander in chief cast as the Man of Steel, by which I mean the allegedly hamburger-hunting Stalin himself, whose nom de guerre literally meant \u201cman of steel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is not a dictator, but his two-hour speech, possibly the longest ever delivered by a U.S. president, shared many of the traits associated with demagogues who feed off a cult of personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVery long speeches are a way of proving dominance over an audience. In 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin held a press conference that lasted for nearly five hours. Fidel Castro would routinely give speeches that exceeded that. Got somewhere to go? Too bad, I\u2019m the only game in town. Stalin once gave a lengthy speech that was later released on vinyl. The entire B-side consisted of recorded applause.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech was a virtuoso performance, showing off the man in full. But the overriding theme to the pudding was that there is only Trump. One of the great challenges for conservatives in the Trump era has been to navigate between supporting the man\u2019s policies and supporting the man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last two years, you could hear echoes of this tension in the ubiquitous refrain: \u201cHe\u2019s better than Hillary would have been.\u201d That\u2019s a defensible proposition for conservatives, but never before in the history of the conservative movement have conservatives lowered the bar to the Democratic nominee the president faced in the prior election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo serious conservative defended George H. W. Bush by saying, \u201cAt least he\u2019s better than Dukakis would have been!\u201d And no one denounced conservative critics of the 41st president as being secret Michael Dukakis supporters.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s sprawling address, which he began by literally hugging the American flag, he denounced and castigated any competing source of conservative authority, including several people who served in his own administration.\n\nHis fact-challenged braggadocio and his whining \u2014 about the media, the Mueller probe and every other source of inconvenience \u2014 was an at times brilliant, at times pathetic effort to encourage the audience to invest themselves in Trump himself, not his ideas or the ideas that have formed the glue of the conservative movement for decades. Trump\u2019s instincts now have papal authority.\n\nThe schism between defending the man and the agenda was obliterated. Instead of loving what he\u2019s doing despite his faults, the audience was implicitly asked to love him because of his faults. His celebrity is all that matters, and his narcissism is infectious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his 1962 masterpiece \u201cThe Image,\u201d in which he introduced the concept of the pseudo-event, Boorstin posited that a celebrity is a \u201chuman pseudo-event.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe try to make our celebrities stand in for the heroes we no longer have, or for those who have been pushed out of our view,\u201d Boorstin wrote. \u201cYet the celebrity is usually nothing greater than a more-publicized version of us. In imitating him, we are simply imitating ourselves.\u201d\n\nThat was the part of the message that got Trump the nomination and the White House two years ago. And now it\u2019s the entirety of the message from the main stage at TPAC.\n\n(C) 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY, LLC", "description": "Trump\u2019s speech was a virtuoso performance, showing off the man in full.
