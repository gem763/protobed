To that end, they seemed to get another gift today with the White House\u2019s release of a reconstruction of a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. According to the text, Trump clearly asked Zelensky to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate the Biden family\u2019s activities in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s request for \u201ca favor\u201d comes right after the two men discuss aid to Ukraine and Zelensky\u2019s mention that his government was almost ready to buy weapons from the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhat these notes reveal is a classic Mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters. \u201cThis is how a Mafia boss talks.\u201d Schiff will hold a hearing on Thursday for which Democrats have demanded that the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, turn over a report from a whistle-blower that allegedly involves the president\u2019s actions regarding the Bidens and Ukraine. He said the transcribed notes were \u201cfar more damning than I or many others had imagined.\u201d\n\nYet neither Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenants nor her office would offer any specificity on how fast the impeachment investigation might move, or when it would be done. The House is scheduled to depart for a two-week recess on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the timeline will look like except that we all feel a sense of urgency here,\u201d Schiff said. Before the Ukraine revelations, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler had said he hoped the panel could reach a decision by the end of the year, and Raskin predicted, perhaps wishfully, that goal was well within reach. \u201cI have no clairvoyant powers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if I had to bet, I would guess that we\u2019d certainly act before the end of the year.\u201d Khanna hoped for an even faster resolution, saying \u201cbefore Thanksgiving would be ideal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t drag this out to an election year,\u201d he added.\n\nStill, not everyone is on board with the caucus\u2019s sudden lurch toward impeachment.\n\nSome of the more moderate House Democrats still want to obtain both an actual transcript of the call and the whistle-blower complaint, and see what evidence the various committees can put together before vocally supporting the effort. A groundswell of support from House Democrats this week has put the majority of the caucus on record backing an impeachment investigation, but the party has work left to do in order to get a majority of the House. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a vote for a while. We\u2019ll see what the Judiciary Committee comes up with,\u201d said an aide to a Democratic member who has yet to come out in favor of the inquiry. The aide was granted anonymity in order to speak candidly.", "description": "Is this a defining moment in the Trump presidency, or merely some creative packaging?", "authors": ["Russell Berman", "Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19267784398416/facebook.jpg?1569439959", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
