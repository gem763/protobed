I am the greatest, the world\u2019s most overrated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me,\u201d he said to laughter and applause at the annual Alfred E Smith Memorial Foundation dinner.\n\n\u201cAnd you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories.\u201d\n\nTrump called Mattis \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d during an acrimonious White House meeting Wednesday with top Democrats over Syria policy.\n\nThe retired Marine general said he wasn\u2019t bothered by Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cOf course not, I earned my spurs on the battlefield\u2026 and Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d Mattis said, in a jab at the medical condition which allowed Trump to avoid the Vietnam draft.\n\n\u201cAnd I think the only person in the military that Mr Trump doesn\u2019t think is overrated is Colonel Sanders.\u201d\n\nThe softly spoken but battle-hardened former Marine left the administration last year, saying in his resignation letter that Trump\u2019s worldview was irreconcilable with his own.\n\n\u201cI commanded forces in Iraq and Syria and Afghanistan. I tried to bring some peace and order to places with no organized government, chaotic and warring factions, irrational fears and toxic hatred,\u201d Mattis told diners.\n\n\u201cIt was hard work but it wasn\u2019t until I started working in Washington DC that I realized how easy I had it overseas in a combat zone.\u201d\n\nReferring to Trump\u2019s \u201cMad Dog\u201d nickname for him, the general said he had \u201cturned over a kinder, gentler leaf.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to think of myself as less of a mad dog and more of an emotional support animal, and that\u2019s really great because the airlines let me fly for free.\u201d\n\nA year on from leaving the administration, Mattis joked: \u201cThe recovery process is going well, the counselor says I\u2019ll graduate soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cA year, according to White House time, is about 9,000 hours of executive time or 1,800 holes of golf,\u201d he said in another jab at the president.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Former US defense secretary James Mattis\u00a0said he was honored to be the \u201cworld\u2019s most overrated general\u201d in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/57714c_defense-chief-james-mattis-departed-year-in-his-resignation-letter-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
