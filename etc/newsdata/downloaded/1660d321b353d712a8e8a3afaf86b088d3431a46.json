For a man who held the office of national security adviser for just 1 7 months, this is no mean feat.\n\nWhether it represents an accomplishment is another question.\n\nThe first averted disaster would have been an agreement with Kim Jong-un, nearly reached early this year in Hanoi, that would have traded solid U.S. economic and diplomatic concessions for slippery promises of North Korean nuclear disarmament. Presidential sycophants and G.O.P. isolationists would also have cheered the deal, along with more than a few liberals. And Trump would have burnished his self-image as a worthy candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe might have even gotten one. Imagine that.\n\nYet as with every past North Korean promise of denuclearization, the deal would have been a sham. Bolton stopped it by insisting on the North\u2019s full and complete nuclear disarmament up front, a condition Kim could not accept because his regime cannot survive without its weapons. Bolton called Kim on his bluff and Trump on his illusion \u2014 if only for a time. That\u2019s still something.\n\nThe second averted disaster would have been a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Trump abruptly announced in December after a phone call with Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan.", "description": "Well, things could be worse.", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/opinion/11stephensWeb/11stephensWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
