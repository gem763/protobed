Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - The general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team apologised on Monday for a tweet in support of Hong Kong protests, saying he did not intend to offend fans of the NBA team in China.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation on a complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives,\u201d Daryl Morey said in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,\u201d he said, adding that his tweets did not represent the Rockets or NBA.\n\nThe team\u2019s Chinese sponsor and a Chinese sportswear maker suspended work with the Rockets after Morey\u2019s tweet over the weekend.\n\nMorey quickly deleted the tweet, which included an image captioned: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said it recognised Morey\u2019s views have \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d", "description": "The general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team apologised on Monday for a tweet in support of Hong Kong protests, saying he did not intend to offend fans of the NBA team in China.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437905001&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9602K", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
