There's still time to meet 'The Flintstones' roadside attraction", "language": "en", "text": "Bedrock City isn\u2019t bound for rubble just yet.\n\nThe Flintstones\u2019 hometown, a popular stop on the way to the Grand Canyon, will remain open indefinitely while it slowly takes wing as Raptor Ranch in Arizona, reports the Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nOwner Troy Morris, who took over the prehistoric park in January, said visitors are welcome to stroll the grounds as construction continues. At this point, renovations aren\u2019t obstructing access to Bedrock City.\n\n\u201cUntil work gets in the way, there\u2019s no reason to shut it down,\u201d Morris said. The park had been slated to close at the end of summer, but people are still stopping by in surprising numbers.\n\nThough Bedrock signs along the highway have been removed, tourists continue to stop by the kitschy gem. Morris estimated that more than 100 people stop each day to rock some quality time with the modern Stone Age family.\n\nA fond farewell to Fred\n\nEven more pull over for a few photos of the treasured roadside attraction based on \"The Flintstones,\" a popular 1960s animated show featuring Fred Flintstone and best friend Barney Rubble.\n\nBedrock City had long been taken for granite before its impending closure was announced. That seemed to draw people out of the woodwork, and Morris said the vast majority of visitors are there for one last glimpse before Bedrock goes the way of the dinosaurs.\n\nHe discovered that many had been children when they first visited, and now were bringing their own kids to see what passed for road-trip entertainment before the invention of mobile devices and video games.\n\nVisit with Fred Flintstone in Bedrock City. (Photo: Richard Maack)\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of memories here for a lot of people,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe're happy to keep it open for as long as we can.\"\n\nWork is nearly complete on the gift shop, which remains open (Bedrock-branded merchandise, however, is long extinct). Much of the focus now is on the restaurant as well as infrastructure, Morris said.\n\nBedrock City occupies a rich vein of Arizona history, one that runs back to the 1970s when contractor Francis Speckels was hired to build a companion park to the original Bedrock in Custer, S.D., whose pastel-hued structures from another eon lured travelers on their way to Mount Rushmore.\n\nA similar strategy was employed for the western Bedrock City, which rose along a popular highway leading to the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe park was both a business and home for the Speckels family (Francis, his wife Linda and their five daughters). Francis died more than 20 years ago, and Linda ran Bedrock until selling it late last year.\n\nWhen Morris opens Raptor Ranch \u2014 he hopes it will by the spring \u2014 many Bedrock remnants will remain, including characters, a few buildings and the park's longtime centerpiece, the brontosaurus slide. They\u2019ll comprise a children\u2019s playground.\n\nRaptor Ranch will feature exhibits and demonstrations featuring falcons. Morris, a raptor breeder, said the birds will come from his collection.\n\nBedrock City\n\nWhat: Park featuring buildings and characters from the 1960s cartoon \"The Flintstones.\"\n\nWhere: On State Route 64, a quarter-mile north of U.S. 180, Valle, Arizona.\n\nWhen: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily.\n\nAdmission: $5.\n\nCamping: $25 per night for campsite, $40 for RV hookup.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/18/the-flintstones-bedrock-city-gets-last-visitors-arizona/4022709002/", "description": "When Troy Morris bought Bedrock City near in Arizona, he had no idea how many people wanted to say goodbye to \"The Flintstones\"-inspired attraction.", "authors": ["Scott Craven", "Published P.M.
