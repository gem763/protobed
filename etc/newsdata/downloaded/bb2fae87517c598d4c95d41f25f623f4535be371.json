A self-described avid reader, she dropped by The Next Chapter to discuss Three Women by American author Lisa Taddeo.\n\n\"The book that I am immersed in at the moment is called Three Women by Lisa Taddeo. This is a really fascinating read. It is a work of literary nonfiction. It's a book about three women and does a deep dive into women's desire, using these three women as case studies.\n\n\"What's interesting about this book is it seeks to explore women as subjects of sexual desire rather than objects. This book attempts to take a deep dive into the real complexities of women's desire and how much it is informed by social pressures, personal histories, traumas and the judgment of others.\n\n\"I would recommend this book, with an asterisk. It's not an easy read. It's not a light read but it's very thought provoking.\"\n\nJill Barber's comments have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWatch the video for the song Love Is by Jill Barber", "description": "The Halifax singer-songwriter talks about the book she's currently reading.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5335211.1572015635!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jill-barber.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
