She had to withdraw from a pair of majors after that due to the injury.\n\nWorld No. 1 Ko Jin-young finished tied for ninth with a 10 under. But she was named the winner of the LPGA Rolex Player of the Year award regardless of the results of the three remaining events of the season.\n\nShe is the fourth Korean golfer to receive the honor, following Park In-bee (2013), Ryu So-yeon (2017) and Park Sung-hyun (2017).", "description": "Jang Ha-na Wins Inaugural LGPA Event in Busan", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/28/2019102800888_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
