He was fatally wounded, but none of the four deputies involved in the shooting was hurt, according to the sheriff's account.\n\nThe deputies were being placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation, it said.\n\nThe elder Ely, 81, described in the sheriff's account as disabled, was also found at the home and taken to an area hospital for evaluation. There was no immediate word on what may have precipitated the stabbing.\n\nEly is best known for playing the title role in the original prime-time TV \"Tarzan\" series, which ran from fall 1966 until fall 1969 - first on NBC, then on CBS.\n\nHe was the 14th screen actor to inhabit the role of the jungle hero created by Edgar Rice Burroughs since \"Tarzan of the Apes\" was released as a silent movie nearly a half century earlier.\n\nEly performed most of his own stunts, although the famed Tarzan yell was dubbed from a recording of Johnny Weissmuller, the Olympic champion swimmer who starred as Tarzan in a dozen Hollywood film during the 1930s and '40s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Ely hosted the game show \"Face the Music\" and twice hosted the Miss America Pageants. He and Lundeen, a former Miss Florida USA, married in 1984 and had three children, including Cameron.
