Yes, camels! Walking around on ice and snow. It\u2019s true. In 2013, scientists announced they\u2019d discovered mummified leg bones on Ellesmere Island, which belonged to the ancestors of modern-day one- and two-humped camels.\n\nIn fact, enduring the frigid tundra is how scientists think camels got their iconic hump in the first place, because what\u2019s inside helped them survive in an age when many other animals were wiped out.\n\nJohn Hare: What\u2019s inside a camel\u2019s hump is fat, and a lot of people think it\u2019s water. But it\u2019s certainly not; it\u2019s fat, and it nourishes them when they\u2019re on long journeys.\n\nNarrator: That\u2019s right, fat. Each hump can store up to 36 kilograms of it, which can sustain the camel for weeks or even months without food. And that sort of adaptation was especially important 3.5 million years ago, during the middle of an ice age, when the ancestors to modern camels were hanging out in the Arctic tundra.\n\nHare: Talking about the Ice Age, when a lot of mammals were killed during that time, and yet the camel managed to survive by developing this emergency food system, if you like: the hump.\n\nNarrator: Eventually, camels migrated across the Bering Strait into regions of Asia and Africa, where the fat inside their humps helped them adapt yet again. This time, to the blistering-hot temperatures of deserts like the Gobi and Sahara.\n\nYou see, camels are one of the only animals in the world that store all their fat in one spot. And that\u2019s useful for keeping cool in a hot climate because heat can escape faster from the rest of their body, which helps them maintain a lower body temperature. Compare that to other mammals, like humans, who store fat all over, making it a lot harder to stay cool.\n\nToday, camels still use the fat in their humps as a food reserve, but they\u2019re not the only ones. In extreme circumstances, the Turkana tribe in Kenya, for example, will eat camel fat to survive.\n\nHare: They suffer a lot from periods of extreme drought, and I have seen these people, they have been very, very short on food, and this is difficult to believe, but it\u2019s true, slit open the top of a camel\u2019s hump, take out the fat for their own consumption, and then put the top of the hump back on again.\n\nNarrator: But don\u2019t worry, the camel makes a full recovery, and instances are rare. But this practice has started to generate some buzz around camel fat as a new superfood. Turns out, camel fat is loaded with fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Desert Farms, a company that sells camel fat, says that just 1 tablespoon contains 40% of your daily vitamin B12 needs and three times the amount of oleic acid than coconut oil, a superfood staple. And since all that nutritious fat is what fills the hump out, when a camel fasts for long periods, its hump can actually go limp.\n\nHare: The humps gradually diminish in size. If it\u2019s been in a very harsh environment, they go completely limp and flop over the side of the camel\u2019s backbone.\n\nNarrator: Now, since we know that fat is what makes up the hump instead of water, that got us wondering: How do camels stay hydrated in such dry climates? Well, they have unique blood cells that run throughout their entire body, including a few in the hump itself. These blood cells are extremely elastic, perfect for holding a lot of water. Camels can drink up to 115 litres in about 10 minutes, expanding the cells up to 240% in the process.\n\nHare: There are capillaries throughout its body, and when it has a drink, it drinks and drinks and drinks, and it swells up, and it looks as though it\u2019s pregnant.\n\nNarrator: If that\u2019s not impressive enough, the wild camel of China has even been known to survive on salt water.\n\nSo, whether it\u2019s surviving the harsh desert heat, weeks without food and water, or even the Canadian Arctic, the camel is one of the best adapters in the animal kingdom, and that\u2019s in large part thanks to its iconic hump.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
