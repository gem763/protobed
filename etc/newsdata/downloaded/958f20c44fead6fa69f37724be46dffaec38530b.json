We wanted a sibling for Marley.\"\n\nThe three of them were delighted when Kelly didn't just get pregnant, but pregnant with twins.\n\nAfter four traumatic attempts the expectant mum was not one to count her chickens.\n\nBut as the months went by and the doctors continued to reassure her that early bleeds were part of having twins, Kelly started to get excited.\n\nAnd then at 5am on August 13, 2017 - at 32 weeks pregnant - she woke up.\n\n\"I felt wet and pain.\" she said.\n\n\"I had bled through all my sheets and the matress.\n\n\"I bled along the floor to the toilet. I was 2cm dilated.\"\n\nThe couple rushed to hospital where Kelly was given co-codamol to slow the labour process down and steroid injections to strengthen the unborn babies' lungs.\n\n(Image: Kelly Barker)\n\nAt 10.15pm after a long day of intermittent bleeding Kelly had a major hemorrhage called a placenta eruption.\n\n\"I felt blood pumping out of me,\" she remembers.\n\n\"I pressed the button. I thought all of us are going to die.\n\n\"They whacked the heart monitors on and rushed me down for a c-section.\n\n\"I didn't realise it was under general anesthetic. The next thing I could feel someone holding my hand.\n\n\"It was my husband.\"\n\nMark had seen the babies rushed out of the operating ward while he waited outside.\n\nHe agreed with the doctors that Kelly shouldn't be told about the twins' conditions until the morphine had kicked in.\n\nHenry had suffered severe brain damage leading to a condition called Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy, with Stanley weak and in need of breathing support.\n\nKelly broke down when she was told what was happening.\n\n\"I didn't realise until then how bad it was,\" she said.\n\n\"I let out this animal noise. I kept groaning. They said he was on life support.\n\n(Image: Kelly Barker)\n\n\"They said he would have severe disabilities.\"\n\nHenry made it through the night and was then taken in an ambulance from Basildon to St Peter's in Chertsey, Surrey.\n\nThere nurses and doctors in the level three neonatal intensive care unit set about coaxing on the struggling little boy.\n\nKelly followed on two days later while Mark stayed with Stanley for a little while longer.\n\nEventually the whole family made it to St Peter's where they slept in a little room along the corridor from Henry.\n\nFor three weeks they stayed as close to him as possible - Kelly exhausted by stress, feeding the twins and fretful nights' sleep.\n\nShe said: \"Mark became like Henry's protector. A consultant would speak to us every day but I couldn't take it in.\n\n\"But Mark learned everything. He understood the technical side of it all.\"\n\nA small chink of hope revealed itself when Henry came off his life support machine and survived breathing by himself for a full 48 hours.\n\nThe silver lining would prove short lived.\n\nHenry's medical problems returned in a big way and doctors told Kelly and Mark he wouldn't survive.\n\n\"I found it really hard at first because it went from hope to despair so quickly,\" the mum said.\n\n\"By the end the only way he could have survived was if he was on a life support machine.\"\n\nThe family were moved to the Daffodil Room which has a sofa, kitchen and toilet, so the parents could stay by their baby's side.\n\nKelly continued: \"The doctors asked us 'have you thought about Stanley being with him at the end?'\n\n\"At first we thought 'that's not right.'\n\n\"But they said there's such a strong connection between twins that no one understands, but it could help both of them.\n\n\"I never would have thought to do that, but I don't think it could have been more peaceful.\n\n(Image: Kelly Barker)\n\n\"They said our older son could come in and see Henry. We sat on the sofa together.\"\n\nAt 31 days Henry died in his parents' arms.\n\nStanley was discharged from hospital a few days later and the family began working to piece their lives back together at home in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex.\n\n\"I was shocked with how little support there was,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"When we got back from hospital my son was three and he was broken. He was wetting the bed, not eating, licking the walls. He had big anxiety.\n\n\"There wasn't anything free. I felt like I was trying to plan the funeral while looking after a premature baby and it was just like 'deal with it'.\"\n\nThe huge stress of looking after the kids while Mark, 40, tried to run his construction company - all as they went through the grieving process- caused Kelly to shut down.\n\nShe continued: \"I think I did become emotionless, but I had to carry on for them.\n\n\"I wanted to make the funeral the best it could be for Henry.\n\n\"I just shut my emotions down and dealt with those things.\"\n\nThankfully Mark and Kelly have now found a play therapist for Marley to help him deal with the death of his brother.\n\n(Image: Surrey Advertiser)\n\nHelp for the grieving mum - who is at the wrong end of an 18 month talking therapy waiting list - has been less forthcoming.\n\n\"I was getting bad flashbacks whilst back in hospital,\" she said.\n\n\"I woke up and thought they were happening to me. Bad flashbacks to when Henry was dying. One when I woke up thinking I was bleeding again.\n\n\"I had EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) therapy which helped.\n\n\"I can now talk about the flashbacks which I couldn't before.\"\n\nWhen Marley has finished his private play therapy sessions Kelly plans to visit a bereavement counsellor.\n\n\"I have PTSD and bad short term memory,\" she said.\n\n\"I am clumsy now and forget things and loose things all the time. I find it really hard to relax and unstress.\"\n\nWhat's made her mental health problems worse is a nagging sense that things could have been differnet.\n\nKelly continued: \"I just don't know how we will get all the answers. They said there's no definite way to know a placenta eruption will occur.\n\n\"But we know I had the risk factors. I feel like the c-section could have happened quicker. There's no answers.\n\n\"It took us six months before we got an inquest meeting.\n\n\"You shouldn't have to come home after your baby dies and research yourself who to contact and who can help.\"\n\nSands (Stillbirth and neonatal death charity) supports anyone affected by the death of a baby.
