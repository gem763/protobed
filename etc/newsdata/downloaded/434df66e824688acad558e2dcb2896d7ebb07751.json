To name individuals without any regard for their rights or the consequences of doing so goes far beyond any reasonable right of parliament under this procedure.\n\n\u201cThese individuals have no right of reply, and the procedure used fails to afford them any of the protections that would properly be in place. It offends against basic principles of fairness and the civil service duty of care towards its employees.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The government faces being found to have acted in contempt of parliament when MPs and peers return from the enforced suspension in early October.\n\nOn Monday, John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said ministers must comply with the request.\n\nIn response to a point of order from Labour MP Stephen Doughty, he told MPs: \u201c[He] has raised a legitimate matter. The simple answer is that the government must comply with the humble address passed by the House.\n\n\u201cThat is the reality of the matter. A debate has happened, a decision has been made, and it is incumbent on the government to comply manifestly with what has been decided, the spirit, purpose and content of which are entirely clear.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the government\u2019s response, Mr Doughty told The Independent: \u201cThese documents show the shocking impact of a no-deal Brexit on fuel, food prices, medicines and a whole series of other critical parts of national life.\n\n\u201cHowever, the question must now be asked: where are the rest of the documents? Either the cabinet was taking extraordinarily reckless decisions based on six pages of information, or the government has not provided all the documents on Yellowhammer as specifically required by parliament\u2019s vote on Monday.\n\nOn the refusal to release advisers\u2019 correspondence relating to the suspension of parliament, he said: \u201cThe excuses given by ministers for not releasing this will not suffice. Understandably they do not want more controversial information coming out before the Supreme Court case on Tuesday. but I am sure that other information will come into the public domain and they will seriously regret this decision.\n\n\u201cMinisters have not complied with the terms of the motion and they could face contempt proceedings whenever parliament next sits \u2013 which may be sooner than the government thinks.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2019s government is facing further\u00a0accusations of undermining parliament and the prospect of a fresh legal battle\u00a0after ignoring a House of Commons motion calling for key Brexit documents to be made public.\u00a0 Ministers rejected MPs\u2019\u00a0demand that they release in full a series of no-deal Brexit\u00a0impact assessments,\u00a0along with\u00a0details of internal discussions about Boris", "authors": ["Benjamin Kentish"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/19/Boris-Johnson-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
