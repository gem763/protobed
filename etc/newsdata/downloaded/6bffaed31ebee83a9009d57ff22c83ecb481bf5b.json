Mitt Romney. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images white house Trump re-ups Romney attack amid reports on Ukraine phone call\n\nTrump and Romney are at it again.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday reshared a video of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat to President Barack Obama after the Utah Republican senator called for more information on Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFollowing reports that Trump pressured President Volodymor Zelensky to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Romney tweeted Sunday that the allegations would be \u201ctroubling in the extreme\u201d if true \u2014 the first Republican senator to push for an inquiry on the issue. Trump, who has a history of clashing with Romney, responded on Monday night by sharing the video, which includes clips of a disappointed Romney on election night 2012.\n\nThe president initially shared the video in April in response to Romney saying he was \u201csickened\u201d by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Trump\u2019s actions during the 2016 election. Trump tweeted at the time: \u201cIf @MittRomney spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe)!\u201d\n\nIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s latest clash with Romney comes amid renewed calls for an investigation into the president\u2019s actions around the phone call with Zelensky. The new reports have made Democrats who have been reluctant on impeachment much more amenable to the idea, and House Democrats have been demanding the release of the phone call and a whistleblower report about the president\u2019s actions that has been blocked by the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.\n\nRomney has not yet called for specific action against Trump, citing the need for more information. \u201cWhat actions might be taken would depend upon what actually happened,\u201d he said .\n\nRomney\u2019s fellow Republicans, meanwhile, have been cautious in their approach to the reports. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she wanted to see the transcript before passing judgment. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump ally, called on Monday for Trump to make the transcript of the phone call public, but expressed confidence that the president had done nothing wrong.\n\nGraham and Trump have also butted heads in the past \u2014 particularly when they were both vying for their party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination \u2014 but Trump and Romney have remained less cordial since Romney was elected to the Senate in 2018. He has broken ranks with the president on numerous issues, from the character of the late Sen. John McCain to Trump\u2019s tweets calling for U.S. congresswomen to \u201cgo back\u201d to countries \u201cfrom which they came.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which video clips showed a disappointed Mitt Romney.", "description": "The president initially shared the video in April in response to Romney\u2019s saying he was \u201csickened\u201d by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report.", "authors": ["Matthew Choi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ca/05/8fb911bb4c5f92e4dba0cc5fe3bf/190923-romney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
