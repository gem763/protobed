Adams) and the newlyweds fled to Seattle.\n\n\n\n\n\nA newly-engaged Meghan spoke candidly about leaving the show after a seven-year stint during her first joint interview with Prince Harry in November 2017.\n\n\"I see it as new change, a new chapter,\" the small screen star said at the time. \"I've been working on my show [for] seven years, we were so fortunate to have that longevity, and I feel like I checked that box and am very proud of the work I've done there.\"\n\nBut the Duchess of Sussex wasn't left out of the finale entirely, as the script poked fun at her new royal role.\n\nIn a recently released clip which highly amused fans, her onscreen husband is asked how she's doing.\n\n\"If I told you how good, you probably wouldn't believe me,\" he quips.\n\nPlaying on the joke, the official Suits Twitter account shared the scene alongside the caption: \"Turns out Rachel is doing REALLY well.\"\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex left the series ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry alongside co-star Adams who famously attended the royal nuptials on May 19, 2018.\n\nPhoto credit: WPA Pool - Getty Images More\n\nDemonstrating how much her life has changed in a mere matter of months, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are currently on their debut tour of South Africa as a family-of-three.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "There's a reason why creator Aaron Korsh didn't invite her back", "authors": ["Danielle Fowler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ePMmNsyy.0xlwmsdm2.v9g--~B/aD05MjE7dz0xODM4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/1cf243e5abb560a9d0bbd78e1ff13350", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
