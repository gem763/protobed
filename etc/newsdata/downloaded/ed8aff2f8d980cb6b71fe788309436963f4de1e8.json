The team put all of their hopes into the studio\u2019s debut game, Bastion, an action-RPG with a narrator. It succeeded with flying colours. Since then, the studio has released Transistor, Pyre, and Hades, every single one receiving critical acclaim and financial success. The team\u2019s big secret? Everybody\u2019s actually happy about working there.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what two of Supergiant\u2019s co-founders insisted in an interview with Kotaku at PAX West. Still, though, the developers\u2019 long string of successes still seems to surprise them, in a good way. Studio director Amir Rao and writer and designer Greg Kasavin said that when fans ask them what\u2019s next, they can\u2019t answer, because they never know. They\u2019re always focused on their current game.\n\n\u201cSomeone can be like \u2018Hey what\u2019s next for you after Hades?\u2019 and I can say \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 and that\u2019s actually just true,\u201d said Rao. \u201cBecause our games are reactions to the last game, so I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna feel. We don\u2019t know how Hades is gonna do overall. We don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna feel whenever we reach whatever that point is where we have to start thinking about the next one. So it\u2019s like we all get to be surprised along with everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the games industry, man,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cIt\u2019s tough out there. You roll dice more times over time, and, you know, you might roll snake eyes one day.\u201d\n\nMiraculously, Supergiant has yet to come even close to rolling snake eyes. Each of the now 17-person studio\u2019s games has been an entirely new series \u2014 no sequels \u2014 and each has made a splash big enough to keep Supergiant afloat and independent. Most recently, it became one of the first developers to sign an exclusivity deal with the Epic Store in December of last year, providing even more financial stability for early access roguelite Hades while simultaneously dodging the brunt of the anti-Epic Store rage and abuse that followed for other developers who signed exclusivity agreements. Meanwhile, other mid-size development studios like Double Fine, Obsidian, Ninja Theory, and inXile have all gotten purchased in the past couple years (and all by Microsoft, no less). Rao and Kasavin recognise they\u2019ve been fortunate, between being in the right time and place with Bastion\u2019s release during the late-2000s indie boom and Supergiant\u2019s subsequent games\u2019 continued ability to find an audience.\n\nTransistor Sings On The Switch I loved Transistor when I first played it on PC, but I struggled with some aspects of the game. The combat system, while interesting and creative, was sometimes tedious to control. On the Switch, the game feels more cohesive. Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been remarkably lucky to not have to navigate some of the really extreme pressures that independent game companies find themselves under because a game doesn\u2019t quite pan out how they thought, or development goes a little bit longer, or the market changes,\u201d said Rao. \u201cWe still exist in that space, but we\u2019ve been fortunate to have our chemistry and bond get us through. And to have worked on games that we love that have found an audience, which enables us to sustain ourselves. We said our games, the concepts, are a reaction to the previous game, but they also are just funded by the previous game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, if we\u2019re gonna be around for the long haul, we can\u2019t operate the same way we did when we were just getting started.\u201d\n\nThe glue that holds the company together, Kasavin thinks, is the collection of personalities on the team and Supergiant\u2019s ability to retain them. That\u2019s the real secret sauce between the buns of Supergiant\u2019s sustained success. Whether due to burnout, layoffs, or other equally pernicious factors, many video game studios have high turnover rates. Supergiant does not. Ten years later, all seven people from the company\u2019s Bastion days are still there, alongside ten others that have been hired during other projects. Kasavin chalks that up to a conscious focus on health and personal growth.\n\n\u201cYou mention sustainability,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cThat\u2019s a word we use a lot, and it\u2019s something that we really highly prioritise as a team. We\u2019ve been working together for ten years. The percentage of folks on the team that have gotten married or had kids or something is quite a bit higher than when it was just Amir and [co-founder] Gavin Simon in the living room of a house and a kind of startup company lifestyle. It\u2019s like, if we\u2019re gonna be around for the long haul, we can\u2019t operate the same way we did when we were just getting started.\u201d\n\nImage: Supergiant Games\n\nThe studio has made changes over time to ensure that everybody takes care of themselves. For example, Supergiant began as a company with unlimited time off. But, Rao explained, this created an \u201cinvisible pressure\u201d to never stop working, because developers always had endless vacation time in their back pockets. These days, Supergiant still offers unlimited time off, but employees are required to take at least 20 days off per year. \u201cThis is us saving us from ourselves,\u201d Rao said. \u201cThat changes our psychology to \u2018How do I spend this minimum? Where do I put it? Am I doing a summer break, or am I doing every Friday for a little while?\u2019\u201d\n\nRao repeatedly emphasised that, when it comes to company culture, little things add up. As another example, he pointed to Supergiant\u2019s approach to emails on the weekend \u2014 namely, that there shouldn\u2019t be any after 5pm on Friday, even if somebody\u2019s really excited about a new feature or idea, because that risks roping other people into work on the weekend. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean someone can\u2019t get really excited about something and do something if they want to,\u201d said Rao. \u201cIt means the company is not going to ask you to, and you shouldn\u2019t accidentally pull more people into a process that they didn\u2019t necessarily intend to do.\u201d\n\nKasavin and Rao started down their path toward long-term sustainability at Electronic Arts Los Angeles, of all places. The two both worked there not long after the notorious \u201cEA spouse\u201d incident in 2004, in which an EA LA developer\u2019s significant other blew the whistle on the poor working conditions at the studio, with the letter largely focusing on severe and continuous crunch. Kasavin and Rao said that in the aftermath of that landmark moment, EA gave the boot to the studio\u2019s whip-cracking management, and EA LA became uncommonly focused (at least, among big-budget studios) on keeping employees from running themselves so far into the ground that you might as well have put a tombstone on top and called it a day.\n\n\u201cI was 22 when I joined that team, and I didn\u2019t understand why they cared so much,\u201d said Rao. \u201cThen you realise, \u2018Oh, this is a team with a bunch of history,\u2019 and they kept a lot of the talent that had been through a really, really difficult period \u2014 a really, really challenging leadership... Those specific values, how they were going to treat the people involved like they were real human beings with real lives \u2014 that was amazing. I didn\u2019t know that wasn\u2019t how every place was, because that was my first game.\u201d\n\nImage: Transistor\n\nAt that point, I had to ask: Does Supergiant crunch? Kasavin admitted that developers do sometimes work long hours, but he also noted that he thinks the term \u201ccrunch\u201d has become too much of a catch-all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where the term itself is flawed,\u201d he said. \u201cI hesitate to even use the term right now, because it means really different things to different people. We want an environment where we can do our best work.\u201d He pointed to Pyre as an example, saying that Supergiant implemented some of the game\u2019s best-received features only because team members \u201creally wanted to\u201d put in the extra work. However, Supergiant avoids development sprints that have \u201cripple effects.\u201d That might mean, for example, a \u201cwacky design idea\u201d from Rao, which then piles teetering heaps of extra drudgery on the desks of the writing and art teams. But if it\u2019s a more self-contained, individual initiative, Supergiant won\u2019t say no.\n\n\u201cIf [composer] Darren [Korb] wants to go nuts on a piece of music and gets super invested in it and wants to make a 10-minute long incredible final boss theme and invest more of himself into that, it\u2019s like, \u2018Go for it man. We\u2019re not gonna punch the clock for you.\u2019 We\u2019re doing this because we love it,\u201d said Kasavin.\n\nPyre's Composer On The Challenges Of Creating His Most Diverse Game Soundtrack Yet Bastion and Transistor are complicated games with emotional depth. Supergiant Games' latest, Pyre, follows its predecessors \u2014 this time with a focus on existential questions of freedom, religion and dogs with mustaches. Accompanying the games are equally as complex and gorgeously arranged music by composer Darren Korb. Read more\n\n\u201cNot everyone hollers if they\u2019re overburdened by work.\u201d\n\nEven in these moments, however, team members try to temper each others\u2019 more self-destructive impulses. \u201cNot everyone hollers if they\u2019re overburdened by work,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cWe try to look out for each other and say, \u2018Hey, is this too much? Can we alleviate some of the burden here?\u2019 Sometimes it\u2019s not even a question, right? It\u2019s like, \u2018No, you\u2019re doing too much.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a learning process, Rao and Kasavin agreed \u2014 one that\u2019s resulted in a place where people can come into work whenever they want and make time to have friends and families outside it. It might not work for a more literally super-giant 5,000-person company, said Kasavin, but it works for Supergiant.\n\n\u201cIt works because it\u2019s a bunch of individuals, so it doesn\u2019t have to scale,\u201d Kasavin said. \u201cWe talk about how our games are very much built around the idiosyncrasies of the people on the team. Music is a central point because of Darren, voiceover is there because of Logan [Cunningham], and so on. Instead of trying to force everyone into the same work pattern, it\u2019s recognising that creative people \u2014 different stuff makes them tick. The way that Darren does his best work is different from how I might do my best work. Rather than just force us to meet in the middle, just let Darren do his thing because he\u2019s a genius. Let me do my thing because I happen to grind it out late at night sometimes as a writer. You know, I wish I could do my best work within the space of 9-to-5, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t always happen that way.\u201d\n\nImage: Pyre\n\nThis process, honed over the course of many years and through plenty of ups and downs, has culminated in Hades, an early access roguelite about two universally resonant concepts: Greek mythology and crappy dads. Hades would not be possible, said Rao and Kasavin, without the games that came before it and the specific people who made them. It\u2019s a reaction to Pyre, which was a reaction to Transistor, which was a reaction to Bastion.\n\n\u201cWe would talk about how Pyre could have only been our third game,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cThere was no way it could\u2019ve been our first game, because it\u2019s too out there, and there\u2019s no way it could have been our second game either, because with Transistor, it was like \u2018Well, can we do it again? Can we like make a whole thing from scratch that is also cool and has its own identity?\u2019 So with Pyre, we felt really emboldened to just keep going and go wherever our imaginations took us, which ended up being in pursuit of this specific feeling of getting to know a good group of friends and then having to say goodbye to them.\u201d\n\nPyre was also built around the idea that, even if you repeatedly failed, the story would continue to progress. On top of that, it was a dynamic narrative in which \u2014 after a certain point \u2014 characters could just disappear from the story, and again, Pyre\u2019s story had to keep progressing and not fall apart like a wagon whose wheel waved a tearful farewell to its friends and crossed over into another dimension.\n\nEven though it was inspired by the game that came before it, Pyre had also been a long time coming. Rao and Kasavin had chatted excitedly about telling this kind of story while working together at EA LA, and even before that. Now they\u2019re continuing with that philosophy in Hades. You play as the prince of the underworld, who is trying to escape from hell, but if you die, you just return to hell and your divine dad gives you shit about it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no backward progress in Hades because even when you die, the story just kind of moves on with all the characters, who have knowledge of what happened,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cWe\u2019ve been obsessed with that kind of narrative idea. We\u2019ve been obsessed with failure in games as a broad idea, across all our games... In Bastion\u2019s case, you\u2019d die and start again, but there are still little moments of the narration that would at least be different the second time around. And in Transistor, we tried to get you out of your comfort zone by popping out [abilities] when you died and having you scrape by with something different.\u201d\n\nImage: Hades\n\nSupergiant\u2019s workflow on Hades, too, is a product of what came before. The team consciously designed the game with early access in mind, which has involved a series of almost episodic content updates, the immediate priorities of which Supergiant has had to shift and reorganise according to player feedback. Where the studio was previously releasing individual games in one big burst every few years, it\u2019s now releasing something new every couple months. If the team hadn\u2019t installed a series of anti-burnout failsafes while creating Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre, Hades would\u2019ve been an endless sprint through hell.\n\n\u201cIt takes our existing interest in having a production discipline and makes us really refine that even more, because if your milestone schedule involves crunching every milestone, your whole production process is broken,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cNot only is an individual game development a marathon and not a sprint, but our whole journey is a sort of mega-marathon where our success criteria for a given game is that we get to live another day and make another game after that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is an individual game development a marathon and not a sprint, but our whole journey is a sort of mega-marathon where our success criteria for a given game is that we get to live another day and make another game after that.\u201d\n\nHades, which launched as an Epic Store exclusive, is set to leave early access and make its Steam debut in December. Kasavin and Rao aren\u2019t counting their chickens before they\u2019ve hatched and escaped from hell, but they think stalwart Supergiant fans\u2019 reaction to Hades has been encouragingly positive so far. The future is wide open, but if they have it their way, they\u2019ll get to keep making games together for another ten years.\n\n\u201cYou have these bands where it\u2019s the same people [who] have been together for decades, and it\u2019s incredible,\u201d said Kasavin. \u201cDo you have that with game studios? For us, it\u2019s an aspirational thing. It\u2019s cool we hit our 10-year mark, but could we make it even further? How long can we go while everyone is still doing their thing and wants to keep doing it?\"\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to think about because, speaking personally, there isn\u2019t some other type of work that I aspire to do. I get to work on game stories and make these cool video games. It\u2019s the stuff I\u2019ve wanted to do since I was eight years old, and I finally get to do it. Through thick and thin, this is a rollercoaster ride, but I well and truly love it. I would do it again, I would do it again after that, and so on. And I think many of us feel that way.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s been ten years since Supergiant Games opened its doors.
