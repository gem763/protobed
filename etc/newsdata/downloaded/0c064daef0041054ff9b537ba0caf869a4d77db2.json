The working model: the Fed\u2019s 75 basis points of cuts in 1995 and 1996 to steer clear of a downturn.\n\nIf the Federal Open Market Committee delivers a 25 basis point cut at the conclusion of its meeting on Oct. 30, it will be the third consecutive reduction of the benchmark interest rate. With risks from trade and global concerns abroad continuing to weigh on the U.S. economy, the Fed faces questions about whether the Fed is on the path to further easing in the near-term.\n\nWall Street is projecting a rate cut at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting Wednesday, but analysts are split on whether the easing cycle will stop there, as what Goldman Sachs calls a \u201cthree and out.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrong signaling from Fed leadership indicates that the modest trade war de-escalation since September has not deterred them from completing a 75 [basis point], 1990s-style \u2018mid-cycle adjustment,\u2019\u201d Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs wrote Oct. 24.\n\nFederal Reserve Bd. chmn.

Wells Fargo\u2019s Sam Bullard wrote Oct. 28 that Powell will \u201cwalk a fine line\u201d in communicating forward guidance.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Fed funds futures markets were pricing in a 95.1% chance of another 25 basis point cut at the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on October 30.\n\nBack to 1995\n\nThere is historical precedent to asking if three 25 basis point rate cuts are the perfect defense against a recession.\n\nThat\u2019s because three is the exact number of 25 basis point cuts that the Fed delivered on in the mid-1990s to avoid recession fears amid the Russian debt default and the near collapse of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.\n\nBetween July 1995 and January 1996, the Alan Greenspan-led Fed cut rates three times, for a total of 75 basis points. Before delivering the first of those three cuts on July 6, 1995, Greenspan told FOMC participants that the risks were needed to help the economy work through uncertainty. But Greenspan said it was uncertainty that the economy could \u201cwork its way through.\u201d\n\nBetween 1995 and 1996, the Alan Greenspan-led Federal Reserve cut rates by a total of 75 basis points.

Before the Greenspan cuts in 1995 and 1996, the target federal funds rate was around 6%. The Powell-led Fed saw rates top out at a target range of between 2.25% to 2.5%. Concern is brewing within the Fed about whether easing policy would back the Fed up to zero rates, and by extension, to unconventional policy tools again.", "description": "If the mid-1990s are any indicator, the Federal Reserve could deliver on one more 25 basis point rate cut in this week's policysetting meeting, but no promises after that.", "authors": ["Brian Cheung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lFbgaJL0DPxq9078z39fRQ--~B/aD0yMDA0O3c9MzAxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b68bc940-fa9b-11e9-bfff-53815650ddf7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
