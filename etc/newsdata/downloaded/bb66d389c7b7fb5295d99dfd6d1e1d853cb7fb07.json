Party officials including Khalaf have had contacts with U.S. officials since it was founded in 2018, he said.\n\nAsked about the accusation that Turkey-backed groups had killed Khalaf, the spokesman for the Turkey-backed National Army, which groups Syrian rebel factions, on Saturday said they had not made it as far as that area.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest of terms any mistreatment and extrajudicial execution of civilians or prisoners, and are looking further into these circumstances,\u201d the U.S. State Department spokesman said.\n\nAnkara launched the cross-border assault against the YPG militia on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew some U.S. troops from the border region, opening of the biggest new fronts in years in an eight-year old civil war that has drawn in global powers.\n\nTurkey says the YPG is a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish militants in Turkey and that it reserves the right to protect its borders.\n\nTurkey\u2019s incursion has raised international alarm over its mass displacement of civilians and the possibility of Islamic State militants escaping from Kurdish prisons. The Kurdish-led forces have been key allies for the United States in eliminating the jihadist group from northern Syria.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has threatened Turkey with economic sanctions over potential targeting of civilians and has warned it not to allow any Islamic State militants to escape.\n\nSenior State Department official last week said Ankara should avoid any \u201cdisproportionate and inhumane\u201d actions in northeast Syria, including ethnic cleansing and firing at civilians.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkey-backed groups had killed nine civilians, including Hervin Khalaf, secretary general of the Future Syr...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da364722100002a0dacd77d.jpeg?cache=zetvalvw7t&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
