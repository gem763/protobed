REUTERS/Chris Keane\n\nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - When it comes to clientele, every club confronts a Groucho Marx problem. The comedian famously quipped that he avoided establishments that would have him as a member. Green-finance pledges have had to wrestle with a similar dilemma in deciding whether to prioritise quantity of supporters, or quality.\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment, launched in 2006 with the support of the United Nations, proudly states that it has signatories who control $86 trillion of assets. Yet many attendees at its own conference in Paris earlier this month see the claim as slightly embarrassing. If all that investment was being deployed in line with environmental, social and governance principles \u2013 as PRI membership implies \u2013 climate change would be under control. Instead, only 2% of participants reach the PRI\u2019s preferred level of green disclosure and scenario-planning.\n\nThis should give pause for thought as the United Nation\u2019s Climate Action Summit kicks off in New York this week with two new PRI-style pledges. It\u2019s great that 12 significant asset owners like CalPERS and Allianz are pledging to make their activities carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nIt\u2019s also good that 130 banks including Santander and Citigroup are signing up for the newly launched Principles for Responsible Banking, to align lending with the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement and limit global warming. But that represents only a third of the global banking system \u2013 big names like JPMorgan, Bank of America and HSBC aren\u2019t yet on board. One refusenik told Breakingviews it wasn\u2019t joining because executives feel pledge inflation has devalued the currency of participation.\n\nThe solution is twofold. First, echoing the PRI\u2019s threat to eject 50 laggard signatories, boot out unworthy members. Second, establish a VIP area that is sufficiently alluring.\n\nHere Natixis may have supplied the missing piece of the puzzle. The French investment bank said on Monday it would voluntarily divide 127 billion euros of loans into seven different buckets based on their green credentials, with the risk weighting of the best assets cut in half while the worst rise by a quarter. By publicly and proactively tinkering with capital requirements for each type of loan, the 12 billion euro group is providing its own incentives instead of waiting for regulators to step in. If Natixis-style transparency were to be made mandatory for fellow lenders that signed the Principles for Responsible Banking, green finance\u2019s VIP area could become enticingly busy.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - When it comes to clientele, every club confronts a Groucho Marx problem.
