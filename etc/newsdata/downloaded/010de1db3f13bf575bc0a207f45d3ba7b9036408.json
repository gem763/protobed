Referee Celestino Ruiz called off the fight at one minute, 46 seconds of the round.\n\nDay lay on the canvas for several minutes receiving medical treatment before being removed from the ring.\n\nDay is at least the third boxer to die from injuries sustained in the ring this year.\n\nArgentine boxer Hugo Santillan died in July following a bout in San Nicolas, just north of Buenos Aires.\n\nSantillan's death came just two days after Russian fighter Maxim Dadashev died from brain injuries suffered in a fight in Maryland.\n\nIn his statement on Wednesday, DiBella said he hoped Day's death would prompt US authorities to adopt tougher safety standards.\n\n\"It becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\" DiBella said.\n\n\"This is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action.\n\n\"While we don't have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\"", "description": "American boxer Patrick Day has died after suffering a serious brain injury during his knockout defeat to Charles Conwell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4749/54fb01ef6f5f449ba0e6c280e5d9ed2e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
