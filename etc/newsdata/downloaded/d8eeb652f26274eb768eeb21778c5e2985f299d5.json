One of the things we train on is to dispel inaccurate rumors and ultimately that is what was occurring \u2014 ultimately what the Alabama office did is provide a forecast with their tweet, that is what they get paid to do.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
