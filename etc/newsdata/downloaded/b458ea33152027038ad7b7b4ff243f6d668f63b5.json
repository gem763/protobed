The course was designed to maximize speed and Kipchoge had the help of 41 pacesetters.\n\nKenya's Eliud Kipchoge, the marathon world record holder, crosses the finish line during his attempt to run a marathon in under two hours in Vienna, Austria, October 12, 2019.

He received a call from Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta afterwards.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cHearty congratulations, Eliud Kipchoge,\u201d Kenyatta said in a statement. \u201cYou've done it, you've made history and made Kenya proud. Your win today will inspire future generations to dream big and aspire to greatness. We celebrate you and wish you God's blessings.\u201d\n\nNot an official record for Eliud Kipchoge\n\nThe feat, though, won\u2019t count as an official world record by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) because of the conditions and the help of pacesetters. This event, though, seemed to exist more for the purpose of breaking the two-hour mark than setting the world record \u2014 which Kipchoge already holds, by the way. The 34-year-old ran the Berlin Marathon in 2:01:39 last year and then ran it in 2:02:37 in April, the two fastest official marathon runs in history.\n\nKipchoge and his team had a goal to run the marathon in 1:59:50. They shattered that by 10 seconds. It was Kipchoge\u2019s second attempt at the two-hour barrier; he had unsuccessfully tried to break it in Monza, Italy in 2017.\n\nThe two-hour mark, considered the \u201clast great barrier\u201d in running after Roger Bannister ran a mile in under four minutes in 1954, requires a 4:34 mile pace or better. Kipchoge came in at 4:33.5 minutes per mile. Kipchoge compared the feat to going to the moon.\n\n\u201cI am feeling good. After Roger Bannister it took another 65 years to make history,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gone under two hours to inspire other people and show the world nobody is limited.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\u201cThis shows no one is limited,\" Kipchoge said.", "authors": ["Eric He"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OJEt6LVue1i8sMF1RKeVzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MTkuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X6xjZPYJHm6exoE8hpKjEg--~B/aD0xNzUyO3c9MjczNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/73818ad0-eceb-11e9-996b-b3ecd6a9e64c", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
