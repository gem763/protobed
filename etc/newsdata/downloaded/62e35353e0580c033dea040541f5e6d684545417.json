So when Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins turned Francisco Guardado Rios over to the Department of Homeland Security, the center filed a class action lawsuit against the sheriff, claiming his actions violated the Fourth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.\n\nThankfully, a federal judge has now thrown out that suit. Here\u2019s how it went down.\n\nIn August of 2017, Rios was arrested for driving without a license and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The Culpeper County Jail then received a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and an administrative arrest warrant for Rios from the Department of Homeland Security, as there was \u201cprobable cause to believe Rios was a removable alien.\u201d\n\nThe detainer asked the jail to notify ICE at least 48 hours before Rios\u2019 release, and requested that the jail also maintain custody of the alien \u201cfor a period NOT TO EXCEED 48 HOURS beyond the time when he/she would otherwise have been released from custody to allow [the Department of Homeland Security] to assume custody.\u201d\n\nFurther, the administrative warrant directed immigration officers to arrest Rios and take him into custody \u201cfor removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d\n\nRios was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. After serving his sentence in the Culpeper County Jail, he was held for an additional two days by Jenkins before being turned over to ICE agents.\n\nRios claimed that being held in custody after completing his sentence violated his constitutional rights. He alleged that Jenkins had held nearly 100 other illegal aliens past their release dates in 2017 and 2018, based on ICE detainers.\n\nSenior District Judge Glen E. Conrad ruled, however, that Jenkins acted lawfully in cooperating with Homeland Security.\n\nA key factor was the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 2013 ruling in Santos v. Frederick County Board of Commissioners. The court held that state and local authorities can\u2019t arrest or detain an illegal alien based solely on an immigration charge \u201cabsent federal direction or authorization.\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that Rios was arrested for committing a local crime, not an immigration violation, and that Homeland Security had, indeed, provided the sheriff with specific \u201cfederal direction\u201d and \u201cauthorization\u201d to detain him.\n\nFurther, he observed that no federal court of appeals has \u201cheld that it would violate the Fourth Amendment to comply with an ICE detainer and administrative warrant.\u201d\n\nRios\u2019 lawyers argued that Culpeper County could not comply with a detainer warrant because it had no written agreement with Homeland Security (such as exists under the 287(g) program) to do so. Under the 287(g) program, local law enforcement can enter into a \u201cmemorandum of agreement\u201d with the Department of Homeland Security to assist the agency in identifying and detaining illegal aliens. Homeland Security then provides training and other resources to the local agency.\n\nBut Conrad rejected that argument, too. Even without a written agreement, he said, \u201clocal law enforcement officials may cooperate with ICE in the detention or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States \u2026 when such cooperation is expressly \u2018request[ed]\u2019 or authorized by ICE.\u201d\n\nFurther, Conrad stated, Rios and other detained illegal aliens have no claim under the 14th Amendment because \u201cthe due process clause is not the proper lens through which to evaluate the validity of Rios\u2019 continued detention at the request of ICE. \u2018Compared to the \u2018more generalized notion\u2019 of due process, the Fourth Amendment \u2018provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection.\u2019\u201d\n\nRios\u2019 final claim was that he was \u201cfalsely imprisoned in violation of Virginia law.\u201d Because Conrad held there was no federal cause of action, he declined to exercise jurisdiction over this state law claim. Instead, he dismissed that claim without prejudice, meaning that Rios can file a new lawsuit in state court making that claim, if he wishes to do so.\n\nWhen local jurisdictions refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, they create de facto sanctuaries for criminals like Francisco Guardado Rios. It makes no more sense to release those aliens back into the community than it would make sense to release a convicted criminal who is a U.S. citizen, but who is wanted in another state or by federal authorities.\n\nFor Sheriff Scott Jenkins, job no. 1 is safeguarding the citizens of Culpepper County. Providing sanctuary to criminal illegal aliens isn\u2019t in the job description.", "description": "What should we do with illegal aliens who break local criminal laws?\u00a0\n\nMost people would agree that, once they\u2019ve served their time, they should be removed from the country rather than sent back into the community where they can commit more crimes.", "authors": ["Hans Von Spakovsky", "Commentary By", "Election Law Reform Initiative", "Senior Legal Fellow", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-182778825.jpg?itok=fOvdWctE"}
