As usual, the speech was full of gross distortions and flat-out lies:\n\nAnd as I said, that central idea, that animating principle that we laid out there about doing our best to help the Iranian people be successful [bold mine-DL], I think it set the stage for the work that I\u2019ve done what is now in this last year and a half. It also set the stage for the way that we\u2019ve tried to conduct foreign policy. I\u2019ve continued to deliver tough messages that recognize a set of basic facts about the way the world is, because we can\u2019t achieve good policy unless we recognize the reality of what\u2019s going on with the ground [bold mine-DL].\n\nDuring his brief tenure at the State Department, Pompeo has excelled at misinforming, misleading, and simply lying to the public. One of the most dishonest conceits of his work as Secretary of State is the idea that he is deeply concerned with telling the truth about the way things really are. This is the same man who lied to Congress that the Saudi coalition was making a serious effort to reduce civilian casualties when the coalition was deliberately targeting civilians with their bombing campaign and starving them with their blockade and economic warfare. This is the same man who pretended that the Saudi crown prince wasn\u2019t responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi when it was obvious no one else could have been behind it. He is the one who has lied about the causes of the war in Yemen and he has lied about who is mainly responsible for the humanitarian crisis by trying to put all of the blame on Iran. He lies about Iran and the nuclear deal almost every time he opens his mouth to talk about them. Pompeo has spent most of his time as Secretary of State obscuring \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d to conceal the awful consequences of Trump administration policies. He looks at the way \u201cthe world is,\u201d and then makes up a bunch of whoppers to create a fantasy version that is more pleasing to the president and more flattering for himself.\n\nThe claim that the Trump administration wants to \u201chelp the Iranian people succeed\u201d may be one of the most galling and insulting lies that Pompeo tells on a regular basis. The Trump administration has spent the last year and a half doing everything they can to make the Iranian people more miserable. The sanctions that Pompeo is so proud of are killing sick people by cutting them off from their medicine, destroying the Iranian middle class, dashing the hopes of young Iranians for a better future, suffocating political activists, and bolstering hard-liners. Obviously strangling a country\u2019s economy and impoverishing its people is not going to \u201chelp\u201d them \u201csucceed,\u201d and it isn\u2019t intended to. The idea that Iran hawks have ever wanted to help the Iranian people is belied by their enthusiasm for punitive measures and threats of war. They pay lip service to the people\u2019s aspirations at the same time they support policies that crush those aspirations.\n\nLacking in achievements of their own, the administration has to steal the achievements of the preceding administration:\n\nIt was the Trump administration, with the help of the SDF fighters and 70 nations that built a coalition \u2013 something that never gets talked about \u2013 the work that we did to build out that team united around the destruction of the caliphate in Syria and Iraq was important and effective.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s role is never talked about here because they aren\u2019t the ones that built this coalition. They inherited it and essentially continued the same policy, and now Pompeo has the nerve to take credit for something that he had very little to do with. He then has the gall to repeat his refrain about truth-telling:\n\nMy responsibility, for a start, is to help countries see the world for what it is.\n\nThat may be what Pompeo ought to be doing, but it certainly isn\u2019t what he has done. He has acted as Trump\u2019s spinmeister and propagandist. He has played the part of a shameless flack desperately concocting fables to cover up for terrible policies. Pompeo has not helped Saudi Arabia to \u201csee the world for what it is.\u201d He has regurgitated their absurd cover stories and whitewashed their crimes. His role in lying about what North Korea agreed to do has meant trying to deceive the entire world.\n\nPompeo\u2019s \u201ctruths\u201d are at best partial, and they are usually so biased and warped by his hard-line views that they are unrecognizable to the rest of us. Few U.S. officials are so preoccupied with boasting about their devotion to the truth as Pompeo, and few are as thoroughly dishonest as he is. He keeps bringing this up throughout the speech:\n\nBut showing up only matters if you\u2019re there for a purpose and that you\u2019re willing to tell the truth when it\u2019s tough and that you\u2019ll continue to speak to them about things that are hard.\n\nAs countless journalists can attest, Pompeo doesn\u2019t like telling the truth, and he really hates it when they ask him questions that expose his statements as false and misleading. He doesn\u2019t like telling the truth when it\u2019s easy, much less when it\u2019s tough, and he attacks anyone willing to confront him about the Trump administration\u2019s failures.\n\nThere is a reason no one has told the story of the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy successes: there haven\u2019t been any successes to talk about. The things that Pompeo cites as proof that the administration\u2019s policies are working don\u2019t hold up under scrutiny. He boasts about driving businesses away from Iran, but this is simply inflicting damage. It isn\u2019t achieving anything except destruction. He mentions the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, as if the increased tensions with Iran resulting from the administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign aren\u2019t evidence of failure. He claims that the administration has \u201cchanged the global conversation on China,\u201d but neglects to add that the deleterious effects of the trade war have been borne primarily by American businesses and consumers. Pompeo can point to a lot of activity, but he can\u2019t point to any meaningful results that have advanced U.S. interests one iota. To tell the \u201cuntold story\u201d of the administration\u2019s successes abroad, Pompeo has to keep telling lies.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pompeo-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
