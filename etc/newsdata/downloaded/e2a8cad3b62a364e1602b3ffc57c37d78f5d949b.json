Bernie Sanders, who is pushing a single-payer Medicare for All plan, which has also been endorsed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cI know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.\u201d\n\nBiden criticized Sanders\u2019s plan as too expensive, costing $32 trillion over 10 years. But Sanders said that\u2019s less than the current health care system would cost over the same period.\n\n\u201cIn the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth,\u201d said Sanders.\n\n\u201cThis is America,\u201d interjected Biden.\n\n\u201cYeah, but Americans don\u2019t want to pay twice as much as other countries and they guarantee health care to all people,\u201d Sanders shot back.\n\nObama called Medicare for All a \u201cgood idea\u201d last year. While Biden has touted his plan\u2019s lower cost, it would still leave millions of Americans without health care.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you\u2019ve got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cDo you know why they\u2019re going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease, cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot about cancer. Let me tell you something, it\u2019s personal to me,\u201d said Biden, whose son Beau died of cancer in 2015. He said cancer patients would be covered under his plan.\n\nFrom left, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.

People who have sick family members won\u2019t have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way to pay for health for everyone. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg said the problem with the Sanders bill is that it doesn\u2019t trust the American people to make their own choices, recommending his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, a form of Obamacare with the public option President Obama sought. Sen. Kamala Harris credited both Obama and Sanders for their work on health care but said her own version, which phases in a public option over 10 years, was better.\n\nThe Partnership for America\u2019s Health Care Future, a lobbying group for pharmaceutical companies, hospital groups and the health insurance industry, has come out against both the Harris and Biden plans in addition to Medicare for All. The American health care system is among the most expensive in the world, and also has some of the highest prescription drug costs. At the same time, 28 million people are without health coverage and 79 million have medical debt, and crowdfunding sites to help cover medical expenses are proliferating.\n\n\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "With the three top contenders on the same stage for the first time, rifts in the Democratic Party over health care came into sharper focus at the primary debate in Houston Thursday.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xTNjbAB1JtwwV5vAq1N4yA--~B/aD0yNzczO3c9NDE1OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/51e9a440-d5c9-11e9-b7ff-b6a5715c8413", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
