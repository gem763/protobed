The last of those messages was at 6.05pm on Sunday evening, so we know Craig was alive then.\"\n\nMr Ellery added that Mr Fallon had sent \"a long email\" to his partner.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I'm not going to read it out, as it's personal and private,\" he told the court. \"But there's one line which I will, because it is relevant.\n\n\"Craig said, 'Remember, this was my choice'. That tells me it was not accidental.\"\n\nMr Fallon - who won the -60kg title at the World Championships in 2005 and the European title the following year - was found dead less than five months after becoming head coach of the Welsh Judo Association (WJA).\n\nHe remains the last British judo fighter to win a world title following his win in Cairo.\n\nMr Fallon, who had a partner and son, is also one of only two British men - alongside Neil Adams - to hold the world and European titles at the same time.\n\nThe 2002 Commonwealth Games champion went on to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, placing seventh.\n\nIpswich-born Mr Fallon retired from the sport in 2011.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAfter spending some time in Austria, he was appointed as head coach of the WJA in March.\n\nAfter news of the death, British Judo performance director Nigel Donohue paid tribute to the \"outstanding judo fighter of his generation\".\n\nHe said: \"It is with great shock to hear of the passing of Craig.\n\n\"Craig is a son and father, as well as an outstanding judo fighter of his generation in world judo.\"\n\nHe praised Mr Fallon as a \"fantastic ambassador\" for the sport and \"the most talented judoka I have ever had the pleasure to watch competing for Great Britain\".\n\n\"He will be greatly missed by his family and the judo world, which has lost a talented athlete and coach.\"\n\nChief executive of the WJA Darren Warner said: \"Our heartfelt sympathies are with his family during this difficult time.\n\n\"He was only with the organisation for a short time but was a joy to work with and will be sorely missed.\"\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
