However, he periodically had increased his exposure to Prime via a cash-settled share swap. The swap gave him an economic interest in the company without voting rights, thus helping him avoid breaching ownership restrictions.\n\nMr Gordon is prevented from owning more than 15 per cent of Prime securities by the rule barring an owner holding more than one television licence in a market.\n\nThe failure to properly execute a swap with Vontobel Bank led to Mr Gordon technically holding a more than 20 per cent shareholding in Prime, drawing the attention of ASIC and giving the WIN owner a \"relevant interest\" in Prime above the level he is legally allowed to have.\n\nA \"relevant interest\" is defined as owning securities and having the power to vote and to dispose of securities \u2013 which means cash-settled share swaps generally do not fall foul of the regulations.\n\nIt remains unclear whether WIN will be reprimanded. Sources said the fact Mr Gordon disclosed the issue voluntarily was being taken into account.\n\nACMA, WIN and Prime declined to comment.\n\nThe Financial Review revealed in September the media regulator would look into the matter after ASIC forced a divestment of Mr Gordon's interests in Prime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASIC's request ordered Mr Gordon to have no more than 15 per cent of Prime shares and a total economic exposure, including shares and swaps, of no more than 20 per cent.\n\nPrime shares have fallen 5.2 per cent since the notification that ASIC was forcing Mr Gordon to sell down.\n\nAccording to the latest public disclosures, Mr Gordon holds an 11.6 per cent shareholding in Prime. Deutsche Bank, with which Mr Gordon holds another swap in Prime, has an 8.1 per cent holding. This would take Mr Gordon's total exposure to Prime to 19.7 per cent, below the 20 per cent threshold required by ASIC.\n\nMr Gordon is Nine's largest shareholder, with 14.1 per cent of the company. Nine owns The Australian Financial Review.\n\nMr Gordon's swaps have traditionally been allowed by the media regulator. He has had similar swaps in Network Ten, before it went into receivership, and Nine.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Nine's merger with Fairfax Media last year, Mr Gordon increased his swaps on Nine and eventually cashed in the swap and bought more shares following his dilution when the deal completed in December.\n\nIn 1992, Canadian tax lawyer and media magnate Izzy Asper used a similar arrangement when he increased his economic interest in Ten without owning more than 15 per cent of voting shares to circumvent foreign ownership laws at the time.", "description": "The failure to properly execute a swap with Vontobel Bank led to the WIN owner holding more than 20 per cent of Prime Media, sources say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.5977%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1204%2C$y_537/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a4a551b37ad7dbf667167f923bd167d9a17a494e", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
