This time around, the Z4 comes with a power-folding fabric roof instead of a retractable hardtop, which is good because it\u2019s a lighter arrangement.\n\nHaving a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and not a 6-cylinder motor also keeps the weight down. The extra benefit here is that the steering is nicely responsive.\n\nBMW USA The new BMW Z4 runs around $50,695.\n\nWhile every beholder views with a different eye, the new Z4 nevertheless will likely be considered more pleasing, well proportioned and cohesively designed than its predecessor. Under the exterior, meanwhile, is a structure that BMW claims is the stiffest it\u2019s ever built for an open-topped car. The suspension can be tuned to a finer degree, and the annoying body flex plaguing many other convertibles is absent here.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Take a look at the new 2020 McLaren GT\n\nThis version of the Z4 (after an absence of a few years) is the best that BMW has come up with so far.\n\nWhat\u2019s new for 2019?\n\nThe name is familiar, but the 2019 Z4 is completely new.\n\nWhat we like\n\nContemporary styling\n\nWell tuned chassis\n\nConsiderable amount of power\n\nWhat we don\u2019t like\n\nNo Android Auto smartphone integration\n\nHow much?\n\n$50,695\n\nFuel economy\n\nThe 2019 Z4 has a turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. It produces 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, driving the rear wheels through an 8-speed automatic transmission. There\u2019s no manual option, but the Z4 has paddle shifters mounted beneath the steering wheel and a launch control mode.\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: What\u2019s your \u2018wealth number\u2019?

Trunk space reaches a reasonably roomy 9.9 cu ft. There\u2019s also a luggage pass-through.\n\nSafety\n\nNeither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have crash-tested the 2019 Z4 at this time. Don\u2019t be put off by that, though, as the Z4 has plenty of airbags and other safety equipment.\n\nBehind the wheel\n\nIf you engage launch mode, the Z4 has a respectable 0-to-60 mph time of 5.2 seconds. This entertaining amount of acceleration is complemented by a composed suspension that brings the kind of precision that buyers desire in a sports car and enough suppleness to keep passengers happy.\n\nBoth seats have plenty of adjustment configurations so you can find the ideal position, and they provide ample cushioning and support as well. Even with the fabric roof down, the cabin remains unflustered, thanks in part to a standard-issue wind deflector. Should the weather start to rain on the Z4\u2019s parade, the roof can close in a swift 10 seconds at speeds of up to 31 mph.\n\nOther cars to consider\n\n2019 Alfa Romeo 4C Spider \u2014 It\u2019s not half as civilized as the Z4, but it\u2019s much more visceral.\n\n2019 Audi TT Roadster \u2014 It comes with 228 hp, and it\u2019s the only car in this class to have all-wheel drive.\n\n2019 Mazda MX-5 Miata \u2014 This one is down on power compared with the Z4 and all the other alternatives mentioned here (the MX-5 has 181 hp), but it\u2019s so full of accessible and affordable thrills.\n\n2019 Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class \u2014 This is the only premium 2-seater roadster to come with a folding hardtop. The SLC 300 packs 241 hp, the AMG SLC 43 has 385 hp.\n\n2019 Porsche 718 Boxster \u2014 This is a midengine beauty with sublime handling talents. The range kicks off with 300 hp. The starting price, however, is $10,000 more than the 2019 Z4.\n\nUsed Porsche 911 \u2014 It\u2019s become an icon because it\u2019s so wonderful, and involving, and well-engineered and multitalented and \u2026 considere Porsche\u2019s certified preowned (CPO) program.\n\nSee: The ultimate car-buying checklist\u2014for even the most experienced shopper\n\nAutotrader\u2019s advice\n\nIf the new Z4 stirs your coffee, then go for it.
