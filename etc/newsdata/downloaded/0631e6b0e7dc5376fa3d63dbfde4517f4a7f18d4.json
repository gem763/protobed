The use of ones containing THC was legalised across the UK in November 2018.\n\nThese treatments can be prescribed only by specialist doctors in a limited number of circumstances where other medicines have failed.\n\nFew of these unlicensed prescriptions have been made on the NHS.\n\nThere are some other cannabis-based medicines that are licensed in the UK.\n\nNabilone is a medicine, taken as a capsule, that has been developed to act in a similar way to THC.\n\nDoctors can give it to people having chemotherapy to help with nausea.\n\nSativex is a cannabis-based medicine that contains THC and CBD and is licensed in the UK for people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nRecreational use of cannabis remains illegal.\n\nWhat do experts say?\n\nLey Sander, Medical Director at the Epilepsy Society and Professor of Neurology at University College London, said: \"This new drug will bring hope for some families and EU approval feels like a positive step. Medicinal cannabis, however, still remains a medical minefield and there are many hurdles ahead.\n\n\"CBD was not recommended by NICE for prescription on the NHS. It is important that the pharmaceutical industry continues to work with the medical advisory body to ensure that drugs are cost effective and that its long-term effects are clear.\"", "description": "Epidyolex is an oral solution of cannabidiol that comes from the cannabis plant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B524/production/_108327364_medical-cannabis-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
