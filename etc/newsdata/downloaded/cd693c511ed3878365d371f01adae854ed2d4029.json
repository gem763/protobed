Labor union representatives are also questioning whether the provision as written would extend to self-insured plans.\n\nProgressives are open to strengthening the language when the bill reaches the Rules Committee, before a floor vote, but Democratic leaders so far have demurred, one person familiar with the discussions said.\n\nThe effort is the latest in a series of attempts by leadership to quell progressive attempts to modify Pelosi\u2019s signature drug pricing effort. Earlier this week Democratic leaders urged Ways and Means Committee members to reject Rep. Lloyd Doggett\u2019s amendments that he hoped would push the bill further left. Three separate committees that have jurisdiction over health care issues marked up the legislation.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. But other top Democrats have emphasized this week that the party needs to find common ground so the legislation can get enough votes to clear the House.

Jayapal said it would refund portions of price hikes above inflation to 141 million people with employer-based plans.\n\nOutside groups pushing for drug pricing reform were concerned about the leadership attempts to remove the amendment.\n\n\u201cI understand a desire to improve the text of the amendment to make it workable,\" said Shawn Gremminger, senior director at Families USA. \"But I\u2019d be very concerned about trying to undo an amendment that passed the committee of jurisdiction with every Democrat, including the chairman, supporting.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3d/2b/434afd784ef589511e4949e48e2f/191025-nancy-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
