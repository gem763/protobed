Frank Pallone of New Jersey, insist it will keep soaring U.S. drug prices in check and end the wide disparity with lower prices abroad.\n\nRepublicans on the House committees overseeing the legislation balked that Mrs. Pelosi scrapped months of bipartisan work on drug pricing in favor of the far-left approach.\n\nAmerican Action Network, an issue-advocacy group closely affiliated with House Republican leadership, announced a $2.5 million advertising campaign targeting the bill in 22 congressional districts.\n\nThe campaign will saturate the districts with mail, print and digital ads and hit seven of the districts with television ads.\n\n\u201cPelosi\u2019s heartless drug plan is nothing more than a back door into the socialist health care system the far left has been dreaming of for years,\u201d said AAN President Dan Conston.\n\nSenate Republicans are not taking Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing push lying down, either.\n\n\u201cThe Pelosi drug bill is a bad prescription for the American people,\u201d Sen. John Thune said Tuesday on the Senate floor. \u201cDemocrats know that the Pelosi drug bill has no chance of passing the Senate, but they chose to pursue the socialist fantasy instead of working with Republicans to develop a bipartisan prescription drug bill that isn\u2019t just price controls that might actually go somewhere.\n\n\u201cLike the Democrats\u2019 larger socialist fantasy Medicare for All, the Pelosi drug bill would ultimately hurt the very people that it\u2019s supposed to help, in this case by restricting their access to life-saving drugs and future prescription drug innovation.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee advanced its own drug-pricing legislation this summer with bipartisan support. The Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019 was shepherded to two-thirds\u2019 support of the finance committee \u2014 albeit with several Republican defectors \u2014 by committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon.\n\n\u201cOur plan is leading the way toward a solution that can pass Congress and be signed by the president this year: It is the only comprehensive, bipartisan prescription drug legislation to have passed a congressional committee, and it has been endorsed by more than a dozen advocacy groups spanning the political spectrum, from the senior group AARP to the libertarian Cato Institute,\u201d Mr. Grassley and Mr. Wyden said in a joint statement. \u201cWe encourage our colleagues to work with us to deliver for patients and taxpayers. Americans who can\u2019t afford their prescription medicines are counting on Congress to act now.\u201d\n\nThe fight over drug-pricing legislation has helped spur lobbying growth. The lobbyists at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld just posted their largest-ever quarter as measured by federal lobbying revenue, raking in $11.3 million in the third quarter, up 27.2% over last year\u2019s third quarter. A firm spokesman said the legislative activity around healthcare, trade and appropriations drove the increase.\n\nRival lobbying shop Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck similarly saw its federal lobbying revenue rise dramatically in the third quarter to $10 million, up 22% over last year\u2019s third quarter. Brownstein government relations department chairman Marc Lampkin said he expects the steady pace of lobbying work to continue well into the first half of 2020, contrary to the lobbying slowdown that sometimes accompanies presidential election cycles.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
