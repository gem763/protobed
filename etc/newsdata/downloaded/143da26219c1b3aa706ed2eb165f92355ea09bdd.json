The paper published by the International Monetary Fund puts forth a simpler reason: investment has been rising because domestic demand was boosted by lower personal taxes and higher government spending.\n\nIndia hasn\u2019t decided on cuts to personal taxes, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a briefing on Sunday. She is betting that local firms will pass on the corporate tax cuts to customers in the form of lower prices to stimulate demand.\n\nWhile certain types of firms, such as consumer goods makers, might do so, the bulk of listed companies are already sitting on manufacturing slack and would prefer to reduce debt rather than build factories or hire more workers, Neelkanth Mishra, India strategist at Credit Suisse (SIX: ) Group AG, told BloombergQuint. Indian firms won\u2019t necessarily use the tax cuts to return cash to shareholders -- unlike their U.S. peers -- but fresh investments could take time, according to A. Vaidheesh, managing director at GlaxoSmithKline Plc\u2019s Indian unit.\n\n\u201cThe current slowdown cycle is different from the 2012-13 slowdown as the consumption demand is also significantly constrained,\u201d said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Edelweiss Securities Ltd. \u201cTherefore a broader tax cut covering all economic agents would have probably yielded better economic returns.\u201d", "description": "As India Slashes Corporate Tax, U.S. Evidence May Come in Handy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2b494ca3681a00d8ad0c46f5987e285a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
