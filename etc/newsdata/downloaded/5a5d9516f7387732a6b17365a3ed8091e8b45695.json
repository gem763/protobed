But if you prefer to keep your private insurance, you can.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg joins 2020 Democratic candidates such as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who have advocated for a public insurance option to compete with private plans.\n\nThat\u2019s a contrast to Sen. Bernard Sanders\u2019 universal government-run vision, which would ultimately eliminate private insurance altogether.\n\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, though, said if private insurers don\u2019t end up offering something better, the mayor\u2019s proposal would create a \u201cnatural glide-path\u201d to Medicare for All.\n\nUnder his plan, eligible people would be automatically enrolled in Medicaid or the public option. Other people who can\u2019t afford coverage would receive subsidies, either for private insurance or for the public alternative.\n\nIt would also cap premium payments at 8.5% of income.\n\nThe plan seeks to lower costs by banning health care providers from charging more than twice what Medicare would pay for the same service out-of-network and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors enrolled in traditional Medicare, among other priorities.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
