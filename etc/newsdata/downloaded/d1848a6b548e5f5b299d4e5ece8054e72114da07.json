Naturally, when a stock is this hot, investors wonder whether the strong performance can continue.\n\nI believe there are three main reasons why QCOM stock can continue to trend higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst, the fundamentals underlying QCOM stock remain favorable and imply that the shares could exceed $90 within the next 12 months. Second, the outlook of QCOM stock is improving and should provide sufficient fuel to push the stock towards $90. Third, the technicals of Qualcomm stock imply that QCOM is in the first few innings of a multi-quarter uptrend.\n\nAll told, I think the huge 2019 rally of Qualcomm stock will extend into 2020 and potentially even beyond that. As a result, I will remain bullish on QCOM stock for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Qualcomm Stock Are Strong\n\nThe first reason the rally of Qualcomm stock will continue is that the company\u2019s fundamentals suggest that the shares should continue to climb.\n\nQCOM stock has multiple, positive catalysts. Trade-war tensions are easing. With trade-war tensions falling, the global economy is starting to pick up some steam again. There\u2019s also a great deal of fiscal stimulus on the way from the ECB and U.S. Federal Reserve. All of those trends should lift the global semiconductor market.\n\nWith respect to Qualcomm in particular, the company looks poised to win big over the next few years for two major reasons. First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is QCOM\u2019s customer again, meaning the chip maker will again obtain revenue from iPhone sales.\n\nSecondly, every smartphone will be 5G-capable, and that will provide a huge lift for Qualcomm\u2019s sales and profits, since Qualcomm is the leading global supplier of 5G chips.\n\nAt the same time, Qualcomm\u2019s biggest risk \u2013 legislation which may force it to make its licensing contracts with smartphone companies less favorable \u2013 has been put on hold.\n\nSure, QCOM stock appears to already reflect all this good stuff. The stock does trade at nearly 23-times its forward earnings, versus the semiconductor sector\u2019s average forward earnings multiple of about 15.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut over the next few years, QCOM should grow rapidly. According to YCharts, its revenues are expected to rise 15% next year and 20% the year after that, while its EBITDA margin is poised to climb about five percentage points over the next two years. Its earnings per share, meanwhile, is expected to jump 24% next year, and 40% the year after that to roughly $6.\n\nIf QCOM\u2019s EPS reaches $6 in fiscal 2021 and its price-earnings multiple is 25, which is average for semiconductor stocks, QCOM stock price would be $90.\n\nThe Outlook Is Improving\n\nThe second main reason that the rally of Qualcomm stock will probably continue is that its improving outlook will drive QCOM stock towards $90 over the next few quarters.\n\nFor the longest time, Qualcomm stock did nothing. Now it\u2019s having its best year in 15 years. From a psychological standpoint, that\u2019s meaningful. This large, powerful company didn\u2019t grow much for a long time because of the stagnation of the smartphone market and its disputes with Apple.\n\nNow the smartphone market is set for meaningful growth again, thanks to the launch of 5G, while QCOM\u2019s legal disputes with Apple are over. So the two things which have kept QCOM stock stuck in neutral for the past few years are in the rear-view mirror.\n\nInvestors should want to continue to buy QCOM stock to benefit from its improved outlook. A stock that went nowhere for several years is now breaking out ahead of what should be the company\u2019s best two years in recent memory. That\u2019s compelling.", "description": "Shares of mobile chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have done well in 2019. So far this year, QCOM stock is up more than 38%, and it's only September.
