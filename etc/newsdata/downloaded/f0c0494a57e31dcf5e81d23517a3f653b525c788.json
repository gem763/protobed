UK policing, let alone the Met, has very significant capacity and capability and if we need to draw on that, we will certainly do.\u201d\n\nTom Baldwin, director of communications for People\u2019s Vote, said that despite the special parliamentary sitting, the Met had signalled it would allow the march to Parliament Square, where Extinction Rebellion protesters are camped.\n\nTalks over which group controls Parliament Square on the actual day indicate that Extinction Rebellion is likely to surrender its prime spot to accommodate the anti-Brexit protest, which could form the biggest public rally Britain has ever witnessed.\n\nTo date, the two largest public protests have been the Iraq war rally in 2003 and the last People\u2019s Vote march held six months ago, which both drew more than a million people.\n\nBaldwin added: \u201cIt does look like it\u2019s going to be a very, very large event, without any doubt one of the largest protests this country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nFor next weekend\u2019s People\u2019s Vote march, its third in the capital, 172 coaches have so far been booked from across the country, compared to 130 last time.\n\nThe number of individuals who have signed up to say they will attend the latest march is also already significantly higher. A campaign to raise funds for Saturday\u2019s event reached its target of \u00a3500,000 with a week to spare.\n\nBaldwin added: \u201cBoris Johnson wants to run a campaign of the people versus the politicians. On Saturday you\u2019re going to get politicians like Boris Johnson sitting inside the Houses of Parliament trying to force a form of Brexit on the British people and the people will be outside parliament demanding a final say.\u201d\n\nIt is not yet apparent what form the Extinction Rebellion protest on 19 October will take, other than that it is scheduled to be the climax of 13 days of protest that have so far seen more than 1,100 people arrested since they began last Monday.\n\nThe rate of arrest \u2013 described by a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion as an \u201castonishing number\u201d \u2013 has even prompted speculation that the group might struggle to fulfil its protests for another week.\n\n\u201cWe are still assessing what [the October 19 policing plan] is going to look like and how that works in conjunction with any Extinction Rebellion protest, if indeed the Extinction Rebellion protest is still ongoing,\u201d said Taylor.", "description": "Met may call on officers from across England and Wales on Saturday 19 October for People\u2019s Vote march and finale of Extinction Rebellion action", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27c8f153c0dde4dc59f73d20433d52adb3c84c2e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e11b4864b972d21ae900c7fe1780598", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
