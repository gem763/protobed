Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Sunday in response to the wildfires raging across the state and the \"unprecedented high-winds.\"\n\n\"If you live in an affected area, please stay safe, alert, and heed all warnings from local officials,\" Newsom said in a tweet along with the announcement.\n\nHuman remains were found on Saturday where the Tick Fire ignited at least six houses in the suburbs of Southern California, authorities reported. As fire departments fight back the raging infernos, power outages are expected to impact an estimated 3 million people and tens of thousands of people remain under evacuation orders.\n\nAccuWeather Reporter Blake Naftel, who is in Sonoma County experiencing the wildfires firsthand, saw many people spending their Saturday afternoon prepping their properties and evacuating.\n\nNaftel interviewed a resident in Windsor, California, who was spraying his yard with the hose before leaving his home in hopes of returning to it in the same condition.\n\n\"I already lost one house in the Fountain Grove fire I'm not losing another one if I can help it,\" Eric Schimmel said.\n\n\"Its nerve-wracking for me because I understand the ramifications, I've already been through this one. I know what it does to your life,\" Schimmel said.\n\nSchimmel said his kids are inside handling the situation \u2018pretty well'.\n\n\"This must be a pretty scary thing for them but they're anxious to get going and I'm anxious to get going too,\" Schimmel said.\n\nTwo years after being scarred by deadly wildfires, Sonoma County is under siege again as thousands of firefighters fight to keep powerful winds from fanning the flames of the Kincade Fire.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the Kincade Fire had grown to 30,000 acres and was only 10% contained, according to Cal Fire. Almost 80 structures have been destroyed as 68 crews and a total of 2,830 fire personnel work to control the flames.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the fire was encroaching Highway 128 on both sides in Sonoma County in Healdsburg. Reports say trees and power lines are down throughout the area.\n\nNew evacuation warnings were issued for 50,000 residents for the entire towns of Healdsburg and Windsor. This number is in addition to the 43,000 people already under evacuation warnings from the Santa Rosa suburbs to the Pacific Coast, just 35 miles from the fire's current location. The evacuation orders now extend to the Pacific Ocean in Sonoma County, and there is a concern that fire may cross Highway 101.\n\nSunday morning local time, authorities in Northern California had ordered 180,000 residents to evacuate, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"This is the largest evacuation that any of us at the Sheriff's Office can remember. Take care of yourself,\" said a tweet from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe fires have not only driven people from their homes, but have also impacted businesses such as the wine industry. Nearly 40 square miles of the wine-growing region has been burned as of Sunday morning.\n\nThe Tick Fire started on Thursday afternoon, exploding from 200 acres to 800 acres in less than an hour. By Saturday evening, it had grown to 4,615 acres with 65% containment, according to the Cal Fire.\n\nA new pair of fires began midday Sunday, both impacting I-80 in the Bay Area. The Glen Cove Fire burns in Vallejo, Solano County, and the Sky Fire across the Carquinez Strait near Crockett, Contra Costa County. The Sky Fire is currently at 100 acres, according to the Cal Fire.\n\nIn terms of the overall economic impact on California, wildfires in 2019 won't be as costly as they were in 2018, AccuWeather Founder and CEO Dr. Joel N. Myers said on Friday. Myers estimated that wildfires this year will cost California $100 billion in economic losses, one-quarter of last year's impact, but higher than the $85 billion wildfires cost in 2017.\n\nAccuWeather forecasters believe about half of a million acres in California could be scorched by the end of the fire season, which should conclude in mid-December.\n\nAccuWeather's economic impact estimate is drawn from an in-depth analysis of the population of areas burned by wildfires, the number of acres burned and the number of businesses and homes damaged or destroyed. The analysis takes into account a host of other factors like school closures, insurance costs and state funds devoted to battling the fires.", "description": "California Gov.
