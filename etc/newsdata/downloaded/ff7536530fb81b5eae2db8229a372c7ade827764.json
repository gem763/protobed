The congresswoman from Hawaii made the announcement early Friday.\n\nWhile lagging behind in a crowded Democratic presidential field, Gabbard has gotten renewed attention lately after a heated argument with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman fought back after Clinton said in a recent interview that she believes Republicans have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d Clinton, the former senator and secretary of state who lost to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election despite winning the popular vote, did not name Gabbard directly.\n\nThe squabble seemed to give Gabbard renewed energy on the campaign trail.\n\nGabbard noted in her early morning announcement that the threats of war, international tensions and the threats of a new cold war convinced her she should focus on the presidential race.\n\n\u201cI believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,\u201d she said in her statement.\n\nGabbard, who launched her presidential bid in January, has emphasized her background as a combat veteran. Currently a major in the Army National Guard, she has served for more than 16 years and deployed twice to the Middle East, according to her announcement. She was first elected to Congress in 2012.", "description": "The Hawaii congresswoman has gotten increased attention after a heated argument with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO203_tulsig_ZG_20190725195751.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
