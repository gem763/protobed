Drug mules from French Guiana in South America, carrying cocaine in their luggage or their stomachs, playing a cat-and-mouse game with customs officials at Paris\u2019 Orly airport.\n\nSome get caught. Some do not. The risks are high, but they have little to lose.\n\nIn the customs office, 31-year-old \u201cHenriette\u201d waits on a plastic chair. Her name, and those of other mules in this report, have been changed to protect their identities.\n\nArrested on arrival in Paris, Henriette sits with her arms folded, head hanging, expressionless. Next to her, a large pink suitcase in which a scan revealed suspicious dark shapes.\n\nAn agent opens the case. \u201cThere are only T-shirts\u2026 it\u2019s autumn here Madam\u2026\u201d she enquires.\n\nBut Henriette, sporting a black T-shirt, does not reply: she does not speak a word of French, only one of a clutch of local languages used in Guiana, a French overseas department.\n\nThe agent pulls out seven packets marked as containing Asian seaweed.\n\n\u201cThis is not complicated: It should be light and soft, but it is compact and weighs more than a kilo,\u201d says an agent with a sceptical air who goes on to unwrap the packages and remove their outer layers of algae to reveal black, brick-shaped parcels.\n\nOfficers had detained Henriette because her hands were trembling as she gripped the handlebar of her luggage trolley.\n\nJean-Pierre, 21, was brought in because he had a \u201crobotic gait\u201d typical of people who tape cocaine bullets to their thighs or insert it into their rectums.\n\n\u2013 Shorts in winter \u2013\n\nOther giveaways? \u201cSome wear shorts in winter, they do not know who is fetching them at the airport, or they say they\u2019re going to Toulouse (700 kilometres or 440 miles away)\u2026 by taxi,\u201d said customs official Olivier Gourdon.\n\nThe Cayenne-Orly route, with two incoming flights per day, has become the most popular air passage for South American cocaine to France.\n\nLast year, 1,349 mules in or from Guiana were arrested, double the 2017 number, police data shows.\n\nWith an estimated eight to ten smugglers per flight, the drug gangs are trying to \u201csaturate the control capacities\u201d of French customs, said Gourdon.\n\nSome among the mules are \u201csacrificed\u201d.\n\nThey are given only hand luggage which means they will go through customs first, with only a bit of product, poorly disguised.\n\nSometimes they are given up in an anonymous call \u2014 all to distract customs officials while those with the bigger hauls slip through.\n\nWhile Jean-Pierre puts up a fuss, shouting and swearing at officers, Henriette bats not an eyelid as a knife plunges into one of the black bricks she carried, leaving a trail of white powder.\n\nCosting about 5,000 euros ($5,500) in Guiana, a kilogramme (2,200 pounds) of the drug is sold for seven times that in France to dealers who can double their investment by hawking to individual clients.\n\nHenriette was carrying eight kilogrammes.\n\n\u2013 Death is \u2018rapid\u2019 \u2013\n\nSometimes, the smugglers are made to ingest their cargo.\n\nIf caught, they are brought to the Hotel-Dieu hospital in Paris where they pass, under supervision, the drug-filled bullets they swallowed.\n\nNine rooms are reserved for this laborious and undignified task, under the watchful eye of doctors, police and lawyers.\n\nAfter three days and with the help of a pink laxative gel, 26-year-old Sylvain has expelled all 49 cocaine pellets he had in his body, crouched over a toilet bowl with no flush mechanism.\n\nLong gone are the days of swallowing cocaine stuffed into condoms \u2014 today\u2019s smugglers have gone high-tech. All the Guiana pods are the same: small, black, heat-sealed capsules about three centimetres (1.2 inches) wide.\n\nAs the packaging material has improved, fatal accidents from burst cocaine pods have decreased: two in France in the last 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhen a pod bursts, it (death) is extremely rapid,\u201d said Nicolas Soussy, head of the hospital\u2019s medical-judicial department.\n\n\u2013 No understanding \u2013\n\nThose willing to risk their health, lives and future are mainly poor, unemployed Guianans in their 20s with \u201cno understanding of the death risk,\u201d recounts a nurse who has heard many stories.\n\nMules often talk about how hard it was to swallow the pods, with the aid of a lubricant in the throat.\n\nAnd for what? A few thousand euros of the potential goldmine in their bellies.\n\nAt the court of Creteil outside Paris, which has jurisdiction over the Orly airport region, at least two or three smugglers appear every day.\n\nThe court generally imposes a sentence of about one year per kilo of cocaine smuggled, but even this is no deterrent.\n\nWith a 22-percent unemployment rate in Guiana \u2014 rising to 44 percent among 18- to 24-year-olds, there is no shortage of replacements for captured mules.\n\nOn a given day, 28-year-old tile-layer Thierry is one of three people in the dock.\n\nHe was arrested with two kilos of cocaine hidden in his underwear, his shoes, his suitcase and his stomach, which contained 76 pods.\n\n\u201cIs it the first time you did this?\u201d asked the judge.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did return trips in October, November and December 2018, and in April, May and June 2019,\u201d the presiding officer continued.\n\n\u201cI went to visit my mother.\u201d\n\nThierry got a two-year sentence.\n\nNext in line is Henriette, wiping her eyes on the same black T-shirt she wore when she was arrested.\n\nShe has never been to school and survives on state handouts.\n\nAs the judge talks of the dangers of cocaine to French society, Henriette\u2019s lawyer highlights the misery of Guiana\u2019s \u201cneglected\u201d youth.\n\nA lenient punishment for her eight kilos: Henriette gets two years\u2019 jail time at the prison of Fresnes south of Paris, where half the inmates are female Guianan drug mules.\n\nThree months pregnant, and with eight other children in Guiana, she will give birth in prison, far from home.", "description": "Orly (France) (AFP) \u2013 Every day they come.
