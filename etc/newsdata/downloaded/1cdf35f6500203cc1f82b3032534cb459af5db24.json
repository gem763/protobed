The Ilemi Triangle, a disputed sliver of land along the border with Ethiopia and South Sudan, is the northernmost tip of Turkana, Kenya's poorest county. A series of deadly clashes between the Turkana community and other ethnic groups that they said had crossed from South Sudan have put people on edge, to the point of posting lookouts.\n\nA Turkana warrior drinks water from a swamp. As in many regions across Africa, farmers and nomads frequently clash over limited resources, be it land, cattle or water. Cows and bulls are the most important currency here, not cash. When danger looms, locals say the police are usually far away and neighbours are the only ones they can turn to.\n\nA Turkana warrior passes by a scull of a Nyangatom warrior who, according to Turkana warriors, was killed when he and other Nyangatom warriors attacked a group of Turkana people to take their cattle. In the Turkana community where I was staying, the danger was real. I saw seven or eight places scattered with skulls or bones with shredded clothing during the three weeks I spent in the region. There are a lot of wild animals so bodies left outside don't stay intact for long. Kenya has found oil there, but while politicians in the capital Nairobi haggle over who gets the revenue, the discovery has had little effect on Turkana so far.\n\nLeft: A Turkana warrior prays to gods after a cleansing ceremony as they found footprints of Nyangatom warriors around their settlement.\n\nRight: Turkana Chief Eipa Choro raises his hand as he prays to gods.\n\nTurkana warriors react after finding out that Nyangatom warriors are around their settlement. Nairobi says the county government is responsible for providing many important frontline services like health, early education and roads. The county government says Nairobi doesn't give it enough money to do so. While they argue, people suffer. When it looked like an attack was imminent, some of the young men I witnessed seemed more excited than dismayed by the prospect of a clash with those they feared were after their livestock.\n\nLeft: A Turkana warrior uses a bow and arrow to bleed a cow.\n\nRight: A Turkana warrior bleeds a cow.\n\nA Turkana warrior holds a gun as he protects cattle. We weren't attacked during the time I spent with them, but each time we moved, the community sent out scouts to secure the way and try to spot potential ambushes from cattle raiders. One of the most dangerous times was when they took the cows up to a watering hole right next to the border with Ethiopia. Cattle raiding parties sometimes attack and drive the herd deep into foreign territory.\n\nA Turkana boy crawls as cows approach a settlement. One day a shaman came to read the entrails of a goat. He predicted rain and fighting. The rain came, but no fighting. Instead, news trickled in over scratchy phone lines that the group the men thought were targeting them had attacked another community nearby, carrying off around 600 animals. Reuters could not independently verify the incident.\n\nElderly men talk. Such raids can be a disaster for a community. There's little money here. All serious transactions are done with livestock. Warrior Matthew Logel Matteze told me he had to pay his wife's family 16 cows and 60 goats to marry her. Kenya and South Sudan have set up a joint commission to try to agree on the disputed border.\n\nTurkana warriors react after finding out that Nyangatom warriors are around their settlement.\n\nStory Mawien Makol, a spokesman for South Sudan's Foreign Ministry said the work might be finished by the end of the year.
