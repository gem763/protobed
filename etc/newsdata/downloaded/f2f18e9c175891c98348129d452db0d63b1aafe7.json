Through her lawyers, Sacoolas has said she is \u201cdevastated\u201d and is willing to meet Dunn\u2019s family.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents said Trump had been responsive at their meeting but the planned encounter with Sacoolas had come as a bombshell.\n\n\u201cHe said he was sorry about Harry and then he sprung the surprise that Mrs Sacoolas was in another room in the building and whether we want to meet her there and then,\u201d Tim Dunn said.\n\n\u201cWe said no because as we\u2019ve been saying from the start we want to meet Mrs Sacoolas but we want to do it in the UK so the police can interview her. We didn\u2019t want to be sort of railroaded, not into a circus as such, but a meeting we weren\u2019t prepared for.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and O\u2019Brien had ruled out Sacoolas returning to Britain, Charles said Trump had taken her hand and promised to try to look at the issue from another angle. Stephens said that offer had left open the opportunity for a political solution.\n\n\u201cWe have said for a long time the family needs to meet, they need to meet in private, away from the media and not curated by politicians, spies or indeed lawyers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost sensible folk and not a nincompoop in a hurry would understand that.\u201d", "description": "The U.K. parents, who were invited to the White House, were shocked to discover that the woman involved in the fatal crash that killed their son was in t...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da6fe15210000140f34a193.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
