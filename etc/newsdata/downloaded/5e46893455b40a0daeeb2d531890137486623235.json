New Orleans was victimized by a blatant officiating non-call that led to a rules change allowing pass interference to be part of the video review system.\n\nThe echoes of \u201cWe was robbed!\u201d still reverberate in the Superdome.\n\nSo the Saints won\u2019t need any extra motivation when they visit Los Angeles in a stellar early season matchup. Even if they are trying to downplay the unforgettably painful memories.\n\n\u201cStill haven\u2019t, never will. When you say forgotten about, you have to find a way to compartmentalize it to where you can move on in a positive way, so I found a way to do that,\u201d Drew Brees said. \u201cBut as far as just the events, you live and learn and sometimes things don\u2019t go your way, and you\u2019ve got to find a way to come out better on the other side.\u201d\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton stressed these teams are not the same.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it was a long time ago,\u201d he said of the NFC title match. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our game. These are two different teams now, a lot of roster moves from last year to this year. We\u2019re playing each other early in the season, so it doesn\u2019t feel like that many games ago relative to the distance between when we played. You\u2019re looking at two different teams.\u201d\n\nBoth teams opened with tight victories, New Orleans rallying to beat Houston in the final seconds on Wil Lutz\u2019s 58-yard field goal, the Rams winning at Carolina.\n\nWhile it\u2019s far too early to call this a game for NFC supremacy, the Saints and Rams should be among the conference elite.\n\n\u201cI think our players, our coaches know the level of urgency that\u2019s going to be needed for us to be at our best in order to give ourselves a chance to compete and hopefully come out of this thing 2-0,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said.\n\nThe second week began Thursday night with Tampa Bay\u2019s victory over North Carolina in a game that ended early Friday after being delayed 25 minutes in the first quarter because of lightning.\n\nJameis Winston threw for 208 yards and a touchdown and Tampa Bay held Cam Newton in check and came up with a late goal-line stand to give coach Bruce Arians his first victory with the team.\n\nTampa Bay improved to 1-1, and Carolina dropped to 0-2.\n\nSeattle (1-0) at Pittsburgh (0-1)\n\nA pair of retooling clubs that, for one week at least, looked as if they were headed in opposite directions.\n\nThe Seahawks struggled to beat Cincinnati, but showed the elements of being a contender, particularly their fortitude in coming back. Seattle is 2-7 in Pittsburgh, outscored 45-0 in the past two trips - in 2007 and 2011.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe the Steelers won\u2019t rebound from their abysmal performance in Foxborough. Maybe they need a bit of that fortitude Seattle displayed.\n\n\u201cI like to think everything just flew off and everything was wrong so we can say \u2018That\u2019s not going to happen again,\u2019\u201d defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. \u201cBut we did some things right. Not every play was minus, but I\u2019m going to treat it like every play was.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis (0-1) at Tennessee (1-0)\n\nBoth teams were far more impressive in their openers than predicted. The Colts took the Chargers to overtime, while the Titans manhandled the Browns in Cleveland.\n\nAndrew Luck held a mastery over Tennessee, and Indy has won 13 of the past 15 meetings. Of course, Luck is retired, and the only two Titans wins in that span came with current quarterback Jacoby Brissett behind center. Watch for Marlon Mack, who had a career-high 174 yards rushing at LA and leads the league.\n\nThe Titans are retiring Nos. 27 and 9 for Eddie George and the late Steve McNair at halftime, the first 9 and 27 retired by any NFL team.\n\nSan Francisco (1-0) at Cincinnati (0-1)\n\nTwo more clubs that had solid debuts beyond expectations. San Francisco used two pick-6s to beat Tampa Bay, and the Bengals gave Seattle all it could handle before a one-point road loss.\n\nThe 49ers have the highest winning percentage vs. Cincinnati of any NFL team, and last opened a season with two road wins in 1989. They worked out at Youngstown State to avoid a second straight cross-country flight.\n\nBengals QB Andy Dalton had career highs with 35 completions and 418 yards passing, his first 400-yard game. Eight receivers caught passes, led by John Ross, who had careers highs with seven catches, 158 yards and two TDs. But running back Joe Mixon hurt his left ankle.\n\nKansas City (1-0) at Oakland (1-0)\n\nOne of the great rivalries in sports, dating back to the AFL days. KC leads the series 65-53-2 and has won eight of the past nine.\n\nBut the Chiefs will be without injured star wideout Tyreek Hill, though Sammy Watkins was spectacular against Jacksonville with nine catches for 198 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nThe Raiders had an offensive standout in their win over Denver, too. First-round draft pick Josh Jacobs ran 23 times for 85 yards and two touchdowns, also caught a 28-yard pass that set up a touchdown.\n\n\u201cThis man wasn\u2019t really the feature back at Alabama. He\u2019s not drawing from a lot of experience,\u201d coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to see how he feels \u2026 after 24 touches because we\u2019d like to get him 24 more next week.\u201d\n\nDallas (1-0) at Washington (0-1)\n\nAnother terrific and historic rivalry that has taken on a one-side air: Dallas has won seven of nine.\n\nWashington got off to a nice start in Philly, then phlopped in the second half. It also lost its top running back, Darrius Guice, to a right knee injury, meaning Adrian Peterson - a healthy scratch last weekend - figures to get some action.\n\nNo such worries for the Cowboys now that Zeke Elliott is in the fold. He should be in better form on Sunday, too. And the Dallas passing game ranks first in the league after toying with the Giants.\n\nCleveland (0-1) at New York Jets (0-1), Monday night\n\nLong, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away \u2026\n\nWell, it actually was 1970 and the Jets had Joe Namath and a recent Super Bowl crown, while the Browns were one of the league\u2019s elite franchises with an enviable history.\n\nNow? Gang Green hasn\u2019t been back to the big game since and blew a 16-0 lead at home to Buffalo last week. Those Browns of yesteryear now reside in Baltimore as the Ravens, and this group has made the postseason once in its reincarnation in Cleveland.\n\nStill, the NFL wanted a redux of the first \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d telecast, so here we are, with a pair of clubs that basically faltered in their openers.\n\nNew England (1-0) at Miami (0-1)\n\nShield your eyes.\n\nThe Patriots have had issues in South Florida, losing five of their past six visits. Considering how rarely Tom Brady loses anywhere, that\u2019s striking.\n\nThere\u2019s a catch this year: Miami has its sights on the first overall draft pick, not on-field achievements; did somebody mention tanking? The Dolphins were humiliated by Baltimore 59-10 in the opener.\n\nMeanwhile, Brady and Co. picked apart Pittsburgh last Sunday night, an ominous sign for the rest of the AFC, because the Steelers supposedly are a contender in the conference.\n\nArizona (0-0-1) at Baltimore (1-0)\n\nLamar Jackson, Heisman Trophy owner (2016), meet Kyler Murray, who took that award last season.\n\nBoth exciting and versatile QBs had impressive debuts. Jackson had a career day in only his eighth pro start, completing 17 of 20 passes for five touchdowns. Yes, it was against Miami, but those numbers stand out against anybody.\n\nMurray rallied the Cardinals from a 24-6 deficit in the fourth quarter vs. Detroit, overcoming some early mistakes to produce tons of clutch plays.\n\n\u201cOnce you kind of get in that rhythm, we\u2019re going quick, everything kind of just opened up,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe just got into a rhythm and we started playing better.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (1-0) at Detroit (0-0-1)\n\nThe Chargers and Lions both worked overtime last week. At least LA got the win over Indianapolis.\n\nAustin Ekeler had the winning, 7-yard TD run and finished with a career-high 154 yards from scrimmage. Ekeler became first non-drafted player to have more than 150 scrimmage yards, two receiving and a rushing TD in the same game in 43 years.\n\nDetroit has lost seven of the past eight in the series. Its best hope Sunday might be T.J. Hockenson who had 131 yards receiving, breaking the record for a tight end in his NFL debut set 59 years ago by Monty Stickles.\n\nPhiladelphia (1-0) at Atlanta (0-1)\n\nDeSean Jackson\u2019s return to Philly couldn\u2019t have gone much better. He made eight receptions for 154 yards and a pair of 50-plus-yard TD catches in sparking the Eagles\u2019 rally from a 17-0 hole vs. the Redskins.\n\n\u201cDeSean will tell you he\u2019s got practice speed and he\u2019s got game speed,\u201d coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cPractice speed is around 16 miles per hour and game speed is up to 22. He\u2019s a gamer. He\u2019s dynamic, he\u2019s electric, and he loves when the lights come on. That speed is real, and we saw it Sunday.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s real with the Falcons is hard to tell after an ugly loss at Minnesota, losing first-round pick guard Chris Lindstrom (broken foot).\n\nMinnesota (1-0) at Green Bay (1-0)\n\nTwenty-two of the past 33 regular-season meetings have been decided by seven points or fewer, including both games last season.\n\nAaron Rodgers has seven career games with a passer rating of 130-plus against Minnesota, the most by a quarterback against one team in NFL history. But this one very much could be decided by the defenses.\n\nGreen Bay\u2019s was staunch in its win at Chicago, with five sacks and lots of physicality. The Vikings has two picks, four sacks, and kept Matt Ryan and the Falcons off balance in an easy win.\n\nChicago (0-1) at Denver (0-1)\n\nVic Fangio designed the stingy and aggressive defense the Bears used last season to win the NFC North. He\u2019s now, at age 61, at last a head coach, and his Broncos D, aside from linebacker Josey Jewell\u2019s career-best 14 tackles, was anything but dominant at Oakland.\n\nChicago\u2019s defense once more was very strong, this time with Chuck Pagano as the coordinator. Edge rusher Khalil Mack had 10 sacks, three forced fumbles, 14 tackles for loss in eight career games against Denver while with Oakland. Mack had a career-best five sacks at Denver in with Oakland.\n\nJacksonville (0-1) at Houston (0-1)\n\nIf there\u2019s one team that should be encouraged by an opening loss, it\u2019s the Texans. Yes, their prevent defense prevented victory at New Orleans, but it was Drew Brees, after all, performing magic on the other side.\n\nMost encouraging for Houston was the spectacular combination of Deshaun Watson throwing to DeAndre Hopkins, and expect to see plenty more of that Sunday. Star edge rusher J.J. Watt didn\u2019t play much of a role against the Saints, so expect to see him do so this time.\n\nPity the Jags, who felt they cured their longstanding QB troubles by signing Nick Foles, only to lose him early in falling to Kansas City. Just as bad, the ballyhooed D was hooey.\n\nBuffalo (1-0) at New York Giants (0-1)\n\nDespite the names, the Jets and Giants are New Jersey teams. The Bills are the only real representative of New York state, and they woke up in the fourth quarter at the Meadowlands last Sunday to down the Jets. They return in a rare bit of scheduling to play the Giants while thinking of a Big Apple sweep.\n\nThe Giants need to upgrade the pass defense that was torn apart by Dallas and ranks dead last. Yes, worse than Miami.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Throw that flag.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/saints_rams_preview_football_07310_c0-231-5502-3438_s1770x1032.jpg?8f418d8fadc21c44fb63e2a6551e8666430ac966", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
