I was never really keen on the idea for standing during an entire working day, but sit/stand desks \u2014 the autonomous creatures that raise and lower depending on your needs \u2014 were bulky, expensive, and just outside of my ability to justify spending the extra money. What if I didn\u2019t like it?\n\nAutonomous made it easy for me by offering up one of their sit/stand tests for me to put through the ringer, in my own home. I tried it out for 30 days and never looked back.\n\nI understood the appeal. Standing is beneficial to your overall health, a way to shed a few extra calories while putting an end to some of the gloom-and-doom headlines you may have read about sitting being more dangerous than smoking. But standing desks really aren\u2019t that special, either. On average, they burn just eight additional calories per hour, as opposed to sitting \u2014 it\u2019s not exactly the key to dropping pounds, or anything.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s not a lot known about the long term benefits when weighed against drawbacks like additional joint pain you\u2019ll face as opposed to sitting \u2014 often from standing in place too long\u2026 I have a tendency to hyper-focus on work and forget to move, sometimes.\n\nStill, if I had to guess based on what little science we have to support it, I\u2019d argue that standing is the way to go. That is, so long as you take sufficient breaks to do things like stretch, or walk, or even sit when your joints start to feel tired.\n\nThere was certainly an adjustment period, but the Autonomous sit/stand offering changed the way I work. So needless to say I was super excited to try out another goodie bag \u2014 metaphorically speaking \u2014 of Autonomous products, including the second generation Smartdesk, as well as its ErgoChair 2 and the brand new Kinn Chair, a similar offering to the Herman Miller chair that costs over $1,000 more. (Reviews on both are coming in the next month.)\n\nI\u2019m a bit nerdy about ergonomics, okay? Sue me.\n\nThe SmartDesk 2 hybrid is the newest sit/stand offering from Autonomous. It\u2019s got a steel base capable of hoisting up to 300 pounds with the touch of a button. Better still, it does so quietly \u2014 it\u2019s about the same volume as floor fan on low.\n\nIt\u2019s super sturdy, and quite heavy, which I like. There\u2019s minimal wobbling side-to-side, although it does move a bit more than the first generation model, in my experience. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s flimsy; I can raise and lower it without spilling so much as a drop from a glass of water on the desktop.\n\nAdjusting the desk is accomplished by pressing either the up or down buttons to do so manually, or one of the four presets on the front panel. Pressing and holding the up and down keys at the same time locks the height in, allowing for multiple settings to accompany your office chair, a stool, and even your preferred standing height. Or, if you share a desk, you can lock in multiple heights for those that use it.\n\nThe top and base are both customizable to your liking. I opted for the black version, with a glossy bamboo top. The classic top is about 4.5 feet wide, and 29 inches deep. The XL version is just under 6 feet and 30 inches deep. Both versions are about an inch thick and feel super sturdy.\n\nYou can get either top in black, white, walnut, white oak, or bamboo. The bases are available in black, white, or grey.\n\nAnd look, these certainly aren\u2019t desks that will stop and make you go wow \u2014 they\u2019re quite plain, actually \u2014 but they do the job well, are highly customizable, and they work great in a standard office environment, or your home office. If a minimalist look is your thing, you really can\u2019t go wrong with the aesthetics on offer.\n\nThat said, I do wish that the generation two offering had some additional bells and whistles. I\u2019m glad to see the company seemingly dropped the \u201cAI\u201d assistant, Taylor, which I never actually used. But a few additional features or maybe some new customization options would be worth updating for.\n\nAs it stands, the SmartDesk 2 doesn\u2019t seem to be much of an upgrade from the first one, meaning I\u2019d still recommend buying it, but only if you\u2019re looking for a sit/stand desk. If you have one already, especially the original SmartDesk, I don\u2019t know if I could recommend an upgrade at this time.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for a super sturdy, solid, all-around sit/stand option, you could do far worse. And at $349, it\u2019s a bit of a steal when compared to similar models.\n\nBottom line: Buy it if you don\u2019t already have the original. If you already own the original, or a comparable sit/stand desk, there\u2019s really no reason to upgrade.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bryan Clark", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FIMG_20190908_1532261.jpg&signature=e31d49741a8579cc2a263798bf97b597", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
