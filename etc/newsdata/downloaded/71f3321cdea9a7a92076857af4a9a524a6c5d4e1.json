The company lined up deals to acquire West Coast-focused Cura Partners for nearly $1 billion in May and Chicago-based Grassroots to gain exposure to Illinois which plans to launch legal recreational marijuana sales in January. The company said at least a piece of the widening net loss was attributable to those non-cash acquisition charges as well as depreciation, \u201cthat frankly investors don\u2019t care about.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to grow the top line, profitably. We\u2019ll continue to drive EBITDA as our scale becomes more obvious and we get the benefits of all the work we\u2019ve done to grow our company,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance in an interview on YFi PM.\n\nEye on Massachusetts\n\nAs for catalysts to close out the year and prepare for 2020, beyond Illinois becoming the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana, Lusardi noted that Curaleaf\u2019s home state of Massachusetts will become more important as the recreational marijuana market matures.\n\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019ll get our [Massachusetts] adult-use licenses later this year and that\u2019ll set us up with a huge tailwind going into 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the data out of Massachusetts and the stores that are open, the numbers are fantastic so we\u2019re very optimistic that that will be one of the most important cannabis markets next year, and we\u2019\u2019ll be a big player in that space.\u201d\n\nBut for a sector that has been beaten down heavily these past two months as investors question the profitability of cannabis companies, Curaleaf\u2019s jump following earnings is notable. Lusardi endorsed the cannabis sector overall, however, despite the pain in 2019 that\u2019s embodied by the Alternative Harvest MJ ETF\u2019s 33% decline over the past six months.\n\n\u201cThe thesis is not complicated, we believe that U.S. cannabis is a $100 billion industry. It was only an $11 billion regulated [industry] last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to grow the top line, convert people from the black market to the legal market and if you believe in that thesis, you should buy these stocks.\u201d\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
