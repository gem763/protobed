So I read because it was a solitary thing where I didn\u2019t have to be cracked up at.\u2019\n\nJulia had a stammer (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nBut his sis has still gone onto win a number of awards, forcing her to give numerous acceptance speeches and conquer the fear of public speaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStar Wars actor Harrison Ford also explained his dread back in 2000 when the American Film Institute had chosen him to receive its Life Achievement Award.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported the now 77-year-old saying: \u2018I\u2019m very grateful, I recognise the fact that I\u2019m in great company.\u2019\n\nHowever, he went onto confess: \u2018The greatest fear in my life is public speaking,\u2019 before later admitting that giving speeches is: \u2018A mixed bag of terror and anxiety.\u2019\n\nWe feel you.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHarrison called giving speeches his worst fear (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAnd they\u2019re not the only two Hollywood giants who have struggled with their speech, as Avengers star Samuel L Jackson had to visit a speech therapist as a child.\n\nBut it seemed despite the therapy, there was one word that helped him when it came to stopping his stutter: Motherf***er.\n\nChatting on The Howard Stern Show, the Nick Fury actor explained how shouting the word on the playground helped stop his stammer.\n\n\u2018I have no idea how but it just does,\u2019 he laughed: \u2018It clicks a switch that stops the d-d-d b-b-b, because me I stuttered really, really, really badly for a long time.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever works for you, we guess!\n\nSamuel L Jackson said shouting motherf***er helps (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAs Samuel is shouting motherf***er, Richard Branson is also there dishing up advice on how to conquer the fear of public speaking after getting cold sweat just thinking about his first speech in school.\n\n\u2018I loathe making speeches, and always have,\u2019 he has previously confessed.\n\nThe Virgin ambassador has even quoted Mark Twain on his blog, who once said: \u2018Impromptu speaking \u2013 that is a difficult thing.\n\n\u2018I used to begin about a week ahead, and write out my impromptu speech and get it by heart.\u2019\n\nHe followed this with another quote from the infamous writer: \u2018There are only two types of speakers in the world: 1. The nervous. 2. Liars. So if you\u2019re nervous, you\u2019re in good company.\u2019\n\nRichard Branson found help through Mark Twain (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nJim Gaffigan struggled with stage fright when starting out in his career (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAnd, believe it or not, even comedian Jim Gaffigan struggled with stage fright when starting out in his career.\n\nChatting with CBS Local\u2019s DJ Sixsmith, he said: \u2018It took me a while. I\u2019ve heard that it can take 10 years for a comedian to find a voice and I think it probably did take me 10 years.\n\n\u2018I had a lot of stage fright and stand-up is a conversation with the audience and you will learn through this conversation with the audience\u2026\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll learn how you come across and whether you\u2019re saying things that will make people feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s a learning process and it\u2019s also transferring what makes you funny on stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It didn\u2019t happen immediately for me.\u2019\n\nJust goes to show that even the most successful A-listers still have their insecurities, and it makes us feel just that little bit more connected to the world of celebs.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
