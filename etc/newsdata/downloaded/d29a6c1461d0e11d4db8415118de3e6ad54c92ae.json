Absolutely,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments drew instant attention from Democrats and the establishment media, who took it as a confirmation of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d exchange with Ukraine in order to get military aid to the country.\n\nIn a statement sent to reporters after the briefing, Mulvaney criticized the media for deciding to \u201cmisconstrue my comments.\u201d\n\nHe said:\n\nLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\n\nMulvaney said that the only reason for withholding aid was a lack of military and financial aid from other countries and rooting out corruption from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere was never any connection between the funds and the Ukrainians doing anything with the server \u2013 this was made explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians regarding the server,\u201d he argued.", "description": "White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney clarified comments he made earlier Thursday during a press briefing at the White House.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mulvaney-Press-Briefing-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
