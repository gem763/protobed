Indeed, McDonald\u2019s MCD, +0.73% announced last week that it will be testing a plant-based burger in Canada, joining the likes of Burger King QSR, +1.74%, Carl\u2019s Jr., Tim Horton, White Castle and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts DNKN, +1.56%, which have all jumped on the meatless trend. And plant-based-meat maker Beyond Meat BYND, -2.00% recently became \u201cthe best performing public offering by a major U.S. company in almost two decades,\u201d and unveiled plans for a \u201cmeatier\u201d burger.\n\nAll that may cause you to assume more Americans than ever are now vegan, or at least vegetarian, but you would be wrong. Indeed, a 2018 survey from Gallup shows that only about 5% of Americans say they are vegetarians, a number that is unchanged since 2012. Meanwhile 3% say they are vegans, which is up from 2% in 2012.\n\nBut there\u2019s evidence to suggest that more people should consider these diets, particularly veganism \u2014 which shuns all animal products including meat, fish, shellfish, dairy, honey and gelatin \u2014 for one big reason: It helps the planet, a lot.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study of 40,000 farms in 119 countries published in the journal Science, cutting out your consumption of meat and dairy might be the single most effective step you can take to reduce your negative environmental impact on the Earth. One reason: We get just 18% of our calories and 37% of our protein from meat and dairy, but livestock suck up 83% of our farmland and generate 60% of the agricultural greenhouse gas.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: U.S. pets are responsible for 30% of the environmental impact of meat eating\n\n\u201cA vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,\u201d lead study researcher Joseph Poore of the University of Oxford told the Guardian. \u201cIt is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a vegan or vegetarian diet \u2014 or at least a diet with far less meat \u2014 might improve your health. According to a study published this year in the Lancet, if we ate half as much red meat and sugar as we do now, on average, it would prevent more than 10 million premature deaths from conditions like heart disease and diabetes. And going full-on vegan might give you a health boost, too: \u201cVegans tend to be thinner, have lower serum cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, reducing their risk of heart disease,\u201d a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found.\n\nIndeed, the diet has done the trick for Chicagoan Seth Kravitz, who became a vegan earlier this year. Before that, the 6-foot-tall entrepreneur weighed about 220 pounds and had unhealthily high cholesterol. \u201cI was eating a diet heavy in meat and dairy, light on vegetables, and drinking regularly on top of all that. To combat this, I decided to try out a vegan diet for a month just to see what, if any, changes would come out of it. In the first 30 days, I lost 14 pounds,\u201d Kravitz told MarketWatch.\n\nSee also: Put down your hamburger, and try fly-larvae sausages and locust ice cream\n\nWhat\u2019s more, shunning meat can save you a lot of money. A study published in the Journal of Hunger and Environmental Nutrition in 2015 revealed that a plant-based diet could save you about $750 a year. Invest those savings each year into your retirement account and you\u2019ll end up with upward of $10,000 after 10 years, assuming a 6% rate of return. After 25 years, those savings will balloon to more than $43,000.\n\nOf course, there are downsides to going vegan. While there are more meat and dairy alternatives now than there were a decade ago, for most people, they don\u2019t taste like a real steak or bowl of ice cream. Kravitz notes that it \u201ctakes a ton of perseverance to stick to it\u201d and requires \u201ca lot of research\u201d to learn how to replace certain foods. That\u2019s important because, as the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition notes, vegans do sometimes have nutritional deficiencies for vitamins like B-12 and D, calcium and omega-3 fatty acids, so \u201cappropriate supplements should be consumed.\u201d\n\nIt also can be hard to go out to eat because meat and dairy are in a lot of menu items (though skipping restaurants is likely to save you even more loot). \u201cIt did make for the occasional awkward social situation where I would show up to something and discover I\u2019d have zero vegan options,\u201d Kravitz says. Of course, that depends on where you live, as a WalletHub study released in September \u2014 which looked at metrics in 100 cities such as cost of groceries for vegetarians, the share of restaurants serving meatless options and salad shops per capita \u2014 revealed.\n\n\n\n10 best cities for vegans and vegetarians\n\n\n\n1.
