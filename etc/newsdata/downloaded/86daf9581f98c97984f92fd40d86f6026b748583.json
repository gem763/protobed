In 2004 and 2007, the federal government made changes to the assets test for eligibility for social security payments to include income streams such as annuities and account-based pensions, which were previously exempt.\n\nBut these changes were grandfathered so that people relying on the previous rules in planning for their retirement were not disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cIf they were moved to modern products now, this grandfathering would be lost and the income stream would be fully included in the asset test,\u201d Anderson says.\n\nAnother potential pitfall could face Australians in superannuation products that include a life insurance policy.\n\nSwitching super\n\nSwitching to a new super fund could cause them to lose cover which might not be attainable at the same rate or in the same form if the client\u2019s health circumstances have changed over that period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf rebates of commissions that would have otherwise been paid to advisers are passed on to clients directly \u2013 as some of the large bank-owned wealth management companies are already implementing \u2013 this could also have implications for older clients.\n\n\u201cA rebate will in many cases be taxable income and in the case of partial-age-pension clients may reduce the client\u2019s pension by 50\u00a2 in the dollar,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cIn a limited number of cases it may push the client above the maximum income test threshold for the pension.\u201d\n\nRegardless of age or life stage, switching to a new investment product could also result in hefty exit fees, Anderson adds.\n\nAlthough exit fees have been banned in the superannuation system, they still exist on some other financial products.\n\nThere have been countless instances where the industry has squealed about unintended consequences with no basis to the concerns. \u2014 Erin Turner, campaigns manager, Choice\n\nJohn Ardino, chairman of Lifespan Financial Planning, agrees that clients could face Centrelink and CGT consequences, which could make switching them into newer products problematic.\n\nAside from these technical issues that could create unintended costs or losses in some circumstances, the industry also warns that ending commissions will simply push up the price of advice, making it more expensive for those who already have an adviser and less accessible for those who don\u2019t.\n\n\"The result of all this for consumers is that it will raise the costs of advice, reduce access to advice and leave thousands of clients orphaned without any access to advice,\" Ardino says. \"This is a major disruption for clients\n\nneeding financial advice and a major disruption to the practices of advice providers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnderson warns that if some clients whose advice is now subsidised by product commissions decide they cannot afford a fee for service, their investment portfolios and financial lives could be adversely affected.\n\n\u201cIf clients lose access to advice, then they may find over time their asset allocation progressively moves away from their target asset allocation,\u201d he adds.\n\nBeware the warnings\n\nBut consumer advocacy group Choice, which has long argued that the grandfathered commissions carve-out should be repealed, said consumers should be wary about warnings from industry bodies and lobbyists.\n\nConsumers should be wary of lobbyists warning of \"unintended consequences\" of reform, says Choice's Erin Turner. Supplied\n\n\u201cThere have been countless instances where the industry has squealed about unintended consequences to prevent and slow down reform and there has been no basis to the concerns,\u201d says Choice campaigns manager Erin Turner.\n\nWhile she doesn\u2019t dispute that switching products could result in complexities and even financial losses, she says that is precisely why conflicted payments needed to end.\n\n\u201cA good, holistic, expert adviser is going to consider those issues and will consider the costs as well as any potential benefits,\u201d she adds. \u201cAt least you can now know that the conflict is not there and they can give you a more objective assessment.\u201d", "description": "The federal government\u2019s ban on grandfathered commissions paid to financial advisers creates new complexities and costs for advised investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2704%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3faa71e5c91c77887c1092d20d6cacfe15925420", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
