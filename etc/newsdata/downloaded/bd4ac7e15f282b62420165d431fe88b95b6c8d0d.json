Can\u2019t be possible!\u201d\n\nRepublicans mobilized to undercut Vindman\u2019s credibility, questioning his loyalty by noting he moved to the US from the Soviet Union at the age of three and suggesting he is part of an effort by the US national security bureaucracy to undermine Trump.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is innocent. The deep state is guilty,\u201d said Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz, one of the president\u2019s most strident defenders in Congress.\n\n\u2013 First White House witness \u2013\n\nThe first White House official to testify and a Purple Heart recipient after being wounded in Iraq, Vindman has proved a much more difficult witness for Republicans to dismiss, however, than previous civilian government figures.\n\nThe veteran, who ignored White House orders to defy a congressional subpoena to testify, said alarm bells rang during a July 10 meeting with Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and a Kiev official.\n\nVindland said Sondland pressured the official to open corruption investigations into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine helped Democrats against Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nHe also pushed for a probe into Biden over links between the Democrat\u2019s son and a Ukraine energy company, Burisma.\n\n\u201cFollowing this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d Vindman said.\n\n\u201cI stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security,\u201d he added.\n\nVindland confirmed the public record of the Trump-Zelensky call, in which Trump responded to Zelensky\u2019s request for military aid by asking for \u201ca favor though\u201d before pressing for the investigations of the 2016 story and the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman said.\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Next steps for impeachment inquiry \u2013\n\nAfter interviewing 10 witnesses behind closed doors over the past five weeks, Democrats have drawn up rules for the next stage of the impeachment inquiry that will include public hearings.\n\n\u201cThe evidence we have already collected paints the picture of a president who abused his power by using multiple levers of government to press a foreign country to interfere in the 2020 election,\u201d senior House Democrats said in a statement.\n\nFor the second stage, the House Intelligence Committee will take testimony in open session, with Republicans having a chance to counter with their own witnesses.\n\nIn the third stage, the compiled evidence will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee for review, where the White House will have the opportunity to challenge it and present its own evidence.\n\nThen, if the evidence is strong enough, the committee will draw up articles impeachment to be voted on by the whole House, where Democrats have a strong majority.\n\nThe White House dismissed the process Tuesday as a \u201csham,\u201d claiming that the Democrats were refusing its basic due process rights. The House vote could take place before or shortly after the New Year.\n\nIf impeachment passes, Trump will go on trial for removal in the Senate. The House is expected to vote on the rules on Thursday.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 A decorated Iraq War veteran rocked the White House Tuesday with devastating testimony on Donald Trump\u2019s alleged extortion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/b47caf_lieutenant-colonel-alexander-vindman-white-house-national-security-council-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
