And her reason was Colin Kaepernick.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. I couldn\u2019t dare do that. For what? Who gains from that? Not my people,\" Rihanna told Vogue magazine when asked if she turned down the offer in solidarity with the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler,\" Rihanna said in an interview published Wednesday. \"There\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nABC News has reached out to the NFL but a request for comment was not returned.\n\nThe Grammy-winning pop star has been a vocal supporter of Kaepernick, who was propelled into the national spotlight on Aug. 14, 2016, when he became the first NFL player to take a knee during the playing of the National Anthem to protest racism and police brutality.\n\nKaepernick has not played in the NFL since 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against league owners, alleging that they colluded to ensure that he remains unsigned. The lawsuit was settled in 2018.\n\nThe hip-hop star Cardi B has also said publicly that she passed on the offer to perform at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta in a show of support for Kaepernick.\n\nShe told the Associated Press earlier this year that she had \"mixed feelings\" after she declined an offer to perform at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cI got to sacrifice a lot of money to perform,\" she said. \"But there\u2019s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.\u201d\n\nAll these football team owners talking and all lat but when is y'all going to hire Colin Kaepernick ?\ud83d\ude20 \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) September 24, 2017\n\nAlthough they faced some backlash, Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Outkast's Big Boi ended up performing.\n\nKaepernick's protest sparked a movement, with several other athletes from various sports following his example -- the first of which was then-teammate Eric Reid.\n\nAlthough the protests have quieted down since a surge in 2017, they are not over.\n\nHouston Texans wide receiver Kenny Stills, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Albert Wilson, and Reid, who now plays for the Carolina Panthers, have continued to take a knee this season to keep the message alive.\n\nMy Brothers @E_Reid35 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 continue to fight for the people, even in the face of death threats. They have never moved past the people and continue to put their beliefs into action.

Henderson/Getty Images, FILE\n\nJay-Z, who has supported Kaepernick and the protests, defended the partnership during a press conference with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying he was \"not minimizing\" the protests but added that they were \"not about a job,\" but about \"injustice.\"", "description": "Rihanna confirmed in an interview with Vogue that she did turn down an offer from the NFL to headline the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in support for Kaepernick.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/rihanna2-getty-aa-191010_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
