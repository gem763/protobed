We expect them to come through the training session so I would say they are 99 percent ready.\"\n\nThe usual South African media corps was swollen significantly by the attendance of Japanese media and international press, drawn by the compelling story of Japan\u2019s success at the tournament.\n\nThe Springboks will have the host nation against them, as well as the majority of neutrals, cheering on the Tier 2 nation.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough position to be in, said Erasmus.\n\n\"The first thing is that it\u2019s really tough not to like Japanese people,\" he said.\n\n\"The way they have embraced all teams \u2013 not just South Africa \u2013 on and off the field, and adopting you as a city, putting on South African jerseys and making you feel at home is something special which I have never experienced in my life before.\n\n\"The way they have handled the typhoon \u2013 and I know there have been lots of losses in terms of lives and in different ways \u2013 and we send our condolences from South Africa and the Springboks to those people.\n\n\"But, again, it shows the strength of Japanese people to still host a game; play a game and beat a team like Scotland.\n\n\"However, while saying that, we are playing for our country and we want to try and win the World Cup and for the next week unfortunately Japan is the enemy for one week.\n\n\"We love the country, we love the people, but we have to try and beat them, and we have to play really well to beat them because they are ranked six or seven in the world and they deserve it.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be a really, really tough match for us this Sunday.\"\n\n- SA Rugby", "description": "Pocket rockets Cheslin Kolbe and Herschel Jantjies are expected to be fit for the Springboks\u2019 Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/9fa0d70f7f4c48d39cd068612f81d03c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
