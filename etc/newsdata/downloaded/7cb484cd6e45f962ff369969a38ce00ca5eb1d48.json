Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York discusses drug prices and her vision for healthcare on July 16, 2019. Des Moines Register\n\nALBANY \u2013 After easily winning re-election last year, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand quickly pivoted to a run for president, jumping into a crowded race that once included more than 20 Democratic hopefuls.\n\nBut unlike the record-breaking election wins Gillibrand has raked up in New York, she wasn't successful on the national campaign trail.\n\nThe prodigious fundraising for her New York runs dried up amid a slate of more popular presidential candidates, even in her home state, and she never got more than 1% or 2% in any national poll.\n\nSo she dropped out last month after she failed to qualify for the Democratic debate earlier this month.\n\nGillibrand, 52, said in an interview with USA TODAY Network New York last week that she still hopes to further the national debate on issues important to her, such as access to health care, high-paying jobs and the environment.\n\nHere are her reflections on her campaign, if it's important a woman head the Democratic ticket, who she might endorse and what's next for her:\n\nWhat do you think you learned from the presidential race?\n\n\"I learned that there\u2019s a lot more that binds us than divides us. I saw a lot of commonality on issues in lots of states.\n\n\"People deeply care about access to health care, the right and not a privilege. They are worried about their children and their future, and they want higher-paying jobs and more opportunity, and they care about their kids being able to get a college degree and not have to go bankrupt doing it.\n\n\"The commonality was quite strong, and I was also happy to see that a lot of issues I was leading on were important issues in other states, like clean air, clean water.\"\n\nSo you think you were able to move some issues to the forefront that might not have gotten the attention?\n\n\"Yes, Women reproductive rights. LGBTQ equality. Money in politics. I also felt like I led on things like cannabis, doing a really robust platform on how we legalize, de-schedule and decriminalize marijuana.\n\n\"That\u2019s something I started to explore in New York before I started my national campaign, and I think by being so aggressive on that, it allowed other candidates to follow.\"\n\nMore: Kirsten Gillibrand drops out of 2020 presidential race\n\nAny regrets?\n\n\"No, I really enjoyed running. I loved every minute of it. I learned so much.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to apply everything I learned and be even a better senator for New York.\n\n\"So it was a real privilege. I really felt like I was blessed to have the chance to campaign around the country and talk about big ideas that I think our party should stand for.\"\n\nNothing you think you could have done differently?\n\n\"No, I think my biggest challenge was people didn\u2019t know who I was when I started out, and it was very hard to get a national name with 25 candidates.\n\n\"I\u2019m really proud of how we ran the campaign and what we did in the campaign. And I wouldn\u2019t change any of those things. I think it was just a year where it wasn\u2019t my time.\n\n\"I realized pretty quickly I\u2019d do better serving elsewhere and helping people in my role as senator and in a role as a leader in our party who can drive national debate.\"\n\nCLOSE Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., spoke to the media in Brunswick on Wed., Jan. 16, 2019. Jon Campbell, jcampbell1@gannett.com\n\nWould you try again?\n\n\"You know, I\u2019m going to stay focused on being a good senator for the meantime. But ask me in eight years, and hopefully I\u2019ll answer your question then.\"\n\nDo you prefer to have a woman at the top of the ticket?\n\n\"I ran because I thought I was the best candidate to be at the top of the ticket, and someday we should certainly have a woman, not just having a seat at the table, but a seat at the head of the table.\n\n\"And certainly I thought the best antidote to a misogynist in the White House was a working mom in the White House, but that was very much about my own candidacy. So I will look at these other candidates and get to know their campaigns and what they are running on.\n\n\"And I will endorse someone at some point, but I have not decided.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful US Senator from New York Kirsten Gillibrand speaks during the second round of the second Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign season hosted by CNN at the Fox Theatre in Detroit, Michigan on July 31, 2019.

But I hope there\u2019s at least a woman on the ticket, whether it\u2019s president or VP.\"\n\nBut it\u2019s a not prerequisite for you?\n\n\"I\u2019m going to endorse the person who I think will, number one, be the best president and, number two, who can beat Trump.\"\n\nWhat issues should remain at the forefront?\n\n\"At least four of five issues are really urgent. I think we need a candidate who can take on the NRA and the greed and corruption in Washington, to end gun violence, pass a Green New Deal, put a price on carbon.\"\n\nWhat about Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy and the criticism of whether he is fit for this?\n\n\"I think he\u2019s a strong candidate who, I believe, will beat Trump if he\u2019s our nominee.\n\n\"I think he cares deeply about the future of our country, and has dedicated his whole life to serving others. So I think he\u2019s a very strong candidate, as I do the other front runners.\"\n\nCLOSE Gillibrand calls out Democratic presidential candidates for saying 'the Me Too movement has gone too far'... while answering sexual assault question. Joseph Cress, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\nDid the Al Franken issue (she was the first to call for the former senator's resignation amid allegations of sexual misconduct) hurt your candidacy and getting it off the ground?\n\n\"I think it has certainly been established by the press that it hurt me with regard to a lot of donors around the country, some of the Democratic elite.\n\n\"But as I said many times, sometimes you have to do the right thing, especially when it\u2019s hard.\"\n\nHow do these candidates beat Trump?\n\n\"One thing I did and I really enjoy and I think how you win is you show the American people how you are going to beat him by going to his backyard and talking about all the lies he told in his campaign and that he hasn\u2019t delivered for the people who voted for him.\n\n\"So I took my Broken Promises bus tour to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I think our candidate should be campaigning in these bellwether purple states who voted for Trump last time and really show those voters in those states who they are, why they are running and why they can serve the entire country well.\"\n\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/24/kirsten-gillibrand-talks-her-presidential-run-and-who-she-may-endorse/2429121001/", "description": "Sen.
