You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe man America once knew as Uncle Joe has been leaning on his record as Obama\u2019s VP for a long time, and his opponents have now begun to dismantle that crutch. When he spoke about the realities of trying to bring in gun control legislation, Kamala Harris laughed at him and said: \u201cHey Joe, instead of saying we can\u2019t, let\u2019s try saying \u2018yes we can\u2019.\u201d When he was asked by host Jorge Ramos whether he could admit the Obama administration made \u201cmistakes\u201d on immigration, he floundered, said (for the second time in the night) \u201cWell, things have changed\u201d and then wandered off-topic before being told by an unamused Ramos: \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the worst moment of the night for Biden was an unguarded response he made to Bernie Sanders\u2019 passionate plea for universal healthcare. When Sanders said that other developed countries similar to America have nationalized healthcare systems which function well, while the US leaves millions uninsured and desperate, Biden shrugged and said, \u201cThis is America.\u201d It was a split second and a short sentence, but it was revealing \u2014 and it was so unbelievably flippant that I had to double-check with colleagues that I\u2019d heard him right.\n\nBiden had already mocked Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-All plan in an earlier exchange, which didn\u2019t make him look especially forward-looking or relatable: \u201cHey, let\u2019s have a big idea!\u201d he said derisively, while claiming that Sanders and Warren would never find the money to support their health plan. In a race where most candidates have borrowed extensively from Sanders\u2019 2016 policies, and where properly left-leaning progressive politics are having a renaissance, Biden has been trying to position himself so far as a \u201csteady hand\u201d and a trustworthy seasoned operator. This debate, he took it too far in the other direction. He looked like he was mocking the enthusiasm of young voters and the efforts of his well-qualified peers. He looked like he was unable to modernize.\n\nSanders didn\u2019t put in a fantastic show, either. In his usual manner, he picked three issues to run with \u2014 climate change, Medicare-for-All, and \u201cgreed and corruption\u201d on Wall Street helping to depress wages elsewhere \u2014 and brought every question back to them. He did it when it wasn\u2019t relevant, and he did it when it was. In his closing statement, he said almost exactly the same thing as he said in his opening one, with more of an emphasis on his long political career (this strategy is a rare one he has in common with Biden.) The only time he went off-book was when he said he was \u201cproud to get an F rating from the NRA year after year\u201d \u2014 which would have had more of an effect if he hadn\u2019t been upstaged by Beto O\u2019Rourke calling for compulsory gun confiscations in an emotional speech about shootings in his community (\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15 and your AK-47!\u201d) It wasn\u2019t that Sanders floundered in the way that Biden so obviously did; it was just that his consistency is becoming his downfall in a race where others are constantly updating and changing their techniques.\n\nIt seemed clear that Castro had Biden in his sights tonight, perhaps because he is positioning himself to be VP for a higher polling progressive candidate such as Warren or Sanders. It was clearly an unexpected attack for Biden, who himself went on the offensive against Warren and Sanders, his two biggest threats, early on. Bernie took the bait, getting increasingly worked up in defense of his progressive policies, which Biden repeatedly tried to paint as fiscally unwise, pie-in-the-sky ideas which would damage the American economy. Many love Bernie for his passion, but his frustrated gesticulations did look over-the-top beside Biden\u2019s calculated composure. The person who really won out from this catalogue of exchanges, however, was Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWarren, who was classically prepared and confident, allowed Bernie to take the initial hits from Biden before smiling and calmly reiterating that the proposals Uncle Joe was attacking were viable, were modern, and were well-thought-out. Biden ended up coming across as cynical and stuck in his ways, while Sanders appeared wound-up and excessively ideological. \u201cI know what\u2019s broken, I know how to fix it, and I will get it done,\u201d Warren promised, while peppering her anecdotes with mentions of her military family, her early career in teaching, and the \u201cpredatory lenders\u201d who prey on \u201cex-service members\u201d. This was a socialism story for middle America, and it drew a disproportionate amount of cheers from the Texan crowd.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Yang, who has amassed a huge social media following over the past few weeks, had promised a \u201cbig surprise\u201d at the debate, which turned out to be the announcement that he would use his campaign donations to fund a universal basic income (\u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d) for 10 families over the next year. \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Pete Buttigieg quipped in response.\n\nThere was a lot of speculation before this debate about what might happen when Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden shared a stage together for the first time. Now we have our answer: Warren came out on top thanks to her trademark articulacy and concentration on policy, and Biden gave in to his worst impulses and became a scornful, skeptical relic. Where Biden was concerned that we should \u201cstop America becoming a victim of terrorists\u201d \u2014 a fair enough aspiration, but one which didn\u2019t go much further than that \u2014 Warren was talking about a global strategy to eradicate terrorism, \u201cwith our allies in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America\u201d. Where Biden thought \u201cAmericans want choice\u201d in their healthcare which would allow them to stay with private insurers, Warren merely smiled the smile of an endlessly patient mentor and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who likes their health insurance company. They like their doctors.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear Biden hadn\u2019t prepared for his legacy to be used against him. He looked desperately in need of a modernizing force today, and at the times when he attacked Warren and Sanders, perhaps he should have been cozying up to them. After all, a Biden/Warren ticket \u2014 or even a Biden/Bernie one \u2014 might be the unifying solution that gets enough Democrats to the polls to kick Donald Trump out of the White House. Though today\u2019s debate makes me personally long for a Warren/Castro one instead.", "description": "The third Democratic debate started and ended with Julian Castro. \u201cI worked under President Obama too!\u201d the former secretary of housing and urban development reminded the crowd, when Joe Biden got a little too carried away with his own record under the popular former Democratic president; later, he made the charge that \u201cBiden wants to take credit for the good things Obama did\u201d", "authors": ["Holly Baxter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/22/biden-fight.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
