Simply a black background and five lines of modest text, less of a headline, more of a public service announcement.\n\nThe All Blacks are out of the Rugby World Cup. If you want to read more, go the sports section.\n\nNew Zealand's last defeat at a Rugby World Cup all the way back in 2007 was different. It left a prevailing sense of injustice over a missed forward pass by referee Wayne Barnes.\n\nThere were no excuses this time. New Zealand were humbled by England in Yokohama, the kind of result that leads to a wider assessment of the state of the All Blacks.\n\nThe media have reacted accordingly.", "description": "For the New Zealand Herald on Sunday, there was no front page.", "authors": ["Ben Coles"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/27/ss-composite-image-2019-10-27-12-15-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBZbcvutI8UqFscWeOLocK8ZqUGxGI-SpjAtF4fl6ZDo.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
