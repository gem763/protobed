But actor Imran Adams has promised that the story is far from over \u2013 and he hasn\u2019t seen any viewers with a correct theory yet.\n\nAt the moment, he remains in a relationship with Cleo McQueen (Nadine Mulkerrin) but he continues to be drawn back to Anita. Scott is confused about where Mitchell\u2019s heart truly lies and, to be honest, so is he himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it could be all about to end in tears as the storyline gathers pace.\n\nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk, Imran explained: \u2018Mitchell has so many secrets in his family and his relationships with Cleo and Scott. 2020 is the year that the Deveraux family will get a bigger platform.\n\n\u2018There are loads of conspiracy theories online but I haven\u2019t seen anyone get it right. It\u2019s going to be explosive. Mitchell\u2019s character dynamic definitely changes for Christmas \u2013 and the village is going to change forever.\n\n\u2018Expect the unexpected with Scott and Mitchell. It\u2019s a beautiful story about love and acceptance. Bryan Kirkwood is a genius \u2013 I feel so honoured to be a part of it!\u2019\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nOf course, the pair have to survive the upcoming stunt disaster coming up. As the crane equipment topples, the oblivious couple share a kiss, as shown in the recent trailer.\n\nBut will it be a kiss of death as they finally give in to their feelings towards each other. And, with Nadine set to depart the show for her maternity leave, it looks like any chance of a happy ending for Cleo and Mitchell is dashed regardless.\n\nFans will have to wait and see if Mitchell discovers who he truly is \u2013 and embraces it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will Mitchell and Scott find happiness?", "authors": ["Cydney Yeates", "Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_84419856_1570803428.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
