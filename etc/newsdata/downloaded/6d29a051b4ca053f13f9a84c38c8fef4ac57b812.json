When that didn\u2019t silence the Filipino delegate he went a step further, taking off one of his shoes and banging that on the table instead.\n\nThe famous incident has generated several possible explanations over the years, including that he had removed his shoe because it was too tight, and that it had come off after being stepped on by a journalist. Khrushchev himself was said to be delighted by the angry reaction to the incident.\n\nOne of the few world leaders to come close to matching Khrushchev\u2019s epic level of scorn for a rival was the Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, in 2006.\n\nAn avowed opponent of the United States, the socialist leader compared then US president George W Bush to no less a figure than Satan. Speaking from the podium the day after Bush\u2019s address, Chavez told the assembly: \u201cThe devil came here yesterday!\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And it smells of sulphur still today. Yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, from this rostrum, the president of the United States, the gentleman I refer to as the Devil came here, talking as if he owned the world.\u201d\n\nHis rhetoric provoked nervous laughter among some of the delegates.\n\nThere was more open laughter at the general assembly last year but this time it was the speaker who was left feeling uncomfortable \u2013 Donald Trump.\n\nAddressing the general assembly for the second time since his election, Mr Trump clicked into rally mode by boasting about his achievements, only to find a far less sympathetic audience among his fellow world leaders.\n\nAs he claimed that he had already accomplished more than \u201calmost any administration\u201d in US history, laughter was heard around the chamber. Realising what was happening the president seemed to be momentarily thrown off balance. He paused, smiled awkwardly and said: \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that reaction. But that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nLater he claimed that people had been laughing with him, not at him and that \u201cwe were having fun\u201d. The then US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, explained that delegates were \u201camused by his honesty\u201d. Critics, however, pointed to a 2014 tweet in which Mr Trump said that America was a \u201claughing stock to the entire world\u201d and suggested he had finally got his wish.\n\nAccommodation can be an issue for visiting dignitaries.\n\nIn 2009 the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi created some drama trying to find a place to pitch his famous ceremonial tent in New York.\n\nHe liked to pitch a Bedouin tent and greet his visitors there in the traditional style. On his travels he had pitched it at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris, at the Kremlin in Moscow and in a public park in Rome.\n\nBut in New York he was first turned down from Central Park in Manhattan and a location in New Jersey, before planning to stay on Donald Trump\u2019s estate in the suburban town of Bedford, 80 miles north of New York City. The proposed deal caused outrage among some Bedford residents, who objected to having a notorious sponsor of terrorism staying near by. The proposal eventually fell through although in 2016 \u2013 five years after Gaddafi was killed in the Libyan civil war \u2013 Mr Trump told CBS the talks had brought him \u201ca lot of money\u201d.\n\nOther world leaders linked to terror have had a frostier reception \u2013 in 1988 the US Department of State cited \u201cassociations with terrorism\u201d to reject the visa request of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and did not allow him to travel to New York to speak at the UN. The general assembly then voted overwhelmingly to gather a month later in Switzerland to be able to hear the Palestine Liberation Organisation\u2019s chief.\n\nBritain abstained from that vote, and Israel and the United States voted against. As the host country of the UN, the United States has obligations to issue visas for international delegates to visit the UN.\n\nAnother politician found himself persona non grata in 1995, on the occasion of the UN\u2019s 50th anniversary. The then secretary general, Boutros Boutros-Ghalil, did not invite his predecessor Kurt Waldheim for the celebrations for his alleged complicity in war crimes. Waldheim was a two-term secretary general of the UN and later elected as president of Austria, but was revealed to have been a former intelligence officer for the Nazis in the Second World War.\n\nThe general assembly has also been a venue for controversial props.\n\nIn 2012 the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu produced a drawing which he said illustrated how close Iran was to developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe subject could hardly have been more serious but the picture itself \u2013 a cartoon-style bomb with a fizzing fuse \u2013 invited derision, not least from Tehran, which has consistently denied that it is trying to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe incident was compared to one in 2003 \u2013 at the security council rather than the general assembly \u2013 when the US secretary of state Colin Powell held up a vial of anthrax as evidence of purported weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n\nHis speech played an important role in making the case for the US-led invasion of Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction were never found in Iraq and Colin Powell admitted years later that his UN speech was a \u201cblot\u201d on his record and a \u201cgreat intelligence failure\u201d.\n\nWhether this year\u2019s assembly produces the same level of drama remains to be seen.", "description": "The annual general assembly of the United Nations starts this week in New York, with\u00a0leaders from nearly 200 countries gathering for the world\u2019s largest diplomatic event.
