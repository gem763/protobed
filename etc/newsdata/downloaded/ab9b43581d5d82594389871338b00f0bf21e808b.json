It was also headlined with a speech from Hak Ja Han Moon, widow of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and the leader of the Unification movement that grew from the Unification Church the Rev. Moon founded in 1954 \u2014 a year after war between North Korea and South Korea was frozen by a U.S.-backed armistice.\n\nMrs. Moon called on Japan\u2019s leaders, some of whom were in the audience, to ask for forgiveness for \u201cpast mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ancestors did not understand Heaven\u2019s ways and committed some regrettable actions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd politicians today can ask for forgiveness\u2026 That is the path of righteousness and virtue. If Japan can ask pardon for past mistakes and extend a hand, saying \u2018let us work together for the sake of peace,\u2019 I believe peace is indeed possible.\u201d\n\nMrs. Moon spoke of the need for world leaders to find \u201crighteousness and virtue\u201d instead of \u201cself-centeredness.\u201d Some in the audience took her remarks as criticism of President Trump.\n\n\u201cPoliticians today are not known as the humblest people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who boasts of himself above others, that creates division and discord. Anyone who boats of himself above all others of himself cannot unite with others.\u201d\n\nShe also spoke of climate change, saying the \u201cEarth is suffering.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought typhoons only happened in the summer \u2014 in Korea, many have happened in the fall as well,\u201d she said. \u201cEven in America, many floods and many torrential rains and snowfalls are causing great havoc.\n\nNature is calling out to us, exhorting us to become true stewards of creation. Any leader who does not take the issue seriously will be accused by future generations.\u201d\n\nMrs. Moon has led the Unification movement since a few years before the 2012 death of the Rev. Moon, whose ministry grew from a tiny, embattled church in his native South Korea to a global spiritual movement and an affiliated commercial empire comprising real estate, manufacturing and agricultural operations, and media properties including The Washington Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
