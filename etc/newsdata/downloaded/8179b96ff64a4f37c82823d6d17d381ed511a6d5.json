Because it\u2019s almost Halloween. Get it?\n\nOne person on Twitter made a snarky reply to the burger brand about the Halloween special not being different enough \u2014 \u201cThis is literally just a hamburger,\u201d they said \u2014 and Burger King replied, \u201cbut spooky.\u201d\n\nIn an appropriate stunt, the fast food joint enlisted the help of medium Riz Mirza to channel spirits at a haunted hotel to have them taste test the new burger. In the promotional video, Mirza, who can supposedly lend his body to various ghosts, munched on the new hamburger (as those frightening ghouls), and apparently one even requested a second helping.\n\nAnother ghost chowed down viciously and felt the \u201cunusual and powerful\u201d energy. A third didn\u2019t recognize the sandwich and tossed the burger across the room exclaiming it was \u201cfilth.\u201d But, overall, the spirits loved the creation. When Mirza came back into his body, he hadn\u2019t remembered eating the Ghost Whopper at all.\n\nAt the end of the video, Burger King ominously revealed that the burger is \u201capproved by 11 out of 10 people.\u201d\n\nthe Ghost Whopper is the only burger approved by 11 out of 10 people. come try what the spirits already have. pic.twitter.com/RxYjCHqb6S \u2014 Burger King (@BurgerKing) October 21, 2019\n\nThe 65-year-old burger brand is a little obsessed with Halloween, and has created other specialty, spooky sandwiches in the past. In 2018, it created the Nightmare King, a special take on the chicken sandwich with a bright green bun. And, in 2015, a Halloween Whopper with a black bun flavored with A1 steak sauce was available for a single spine-tingling season. Plus, it created an Upside Down Whopper in honor of season three of Stranger Things.\n\nThis year\u2019s burger is only available in 10 select locations for a week. From October 24-31, burger fans can try the special sandwich if they\u2019re in Detroit, Memphis, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Savannah, Summerville, and New Orleans.", "description": "They even enlisted a medium for a taste test.", "authors": ["Chloe Wilt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hHBGSmmgRYG9VERvL7xOzQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTYyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/dd82e425d0956571efb5903ed555c7cb", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
