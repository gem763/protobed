He is set to meet one-on-one with India's minister for railways and commerce, Piyush Goyal, with whom he also shared the stage at the event.\n\n\"We each know the other's issues, we have for quite some little while,\" Ross said, adding that following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decisive victory in the parliamentary elections earlier this year, the Indian leader has \"a very clear strong position in the parliament, (and it) should be a lot easier to take decisive action.\"\n\nWashington and New Delhi have been locked in a trade dispute for months. For its part, the U.S. removed India from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) earlier this year, citing unequal access to the Indian market\u2014the program, in place since the 1970s and aimed at developing nations, allowed India to export many of its goods into the U.S. market without tariffs.\n\nIndia responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, including almonds, apples, and walnuts.\n\nAccording to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, India was the 13th largest goods export market for the U.S. in 2018. The U.S. goods trade deficit with India last year was $21.3 billion, which was down 7.1% over 2017.\n\nOn the trade front, one of the main focus for President Donald Trump's administration has been to reduce trade deficits with countries and that included renegotiating some of the existing trade agreements. Washington is also engaged in protracted trade war with Beijing\u2014both countries have applied tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, which has created global uncertainty and dampened economic outlook.\n\nRoss explained that while the focus is on reducing trade deficit, the U.S. will not stand for unfair trade practices even if they result in smaller deficits. \"We believe that most of the things we're requesting, particularly of India, would not only help U.S. vis-a-vis India, we think a lot of them would help India itself.\"\n\nThe U.S. wants India to lower tariffs on some of its exports, including motorcycles and certain agricultural products. In return, India wants preferential treatment restored on some of its exports to the United States, according to reports.\n\nA trade deal between the two countries was being speculated during Modi's latest visit to the U.S., where he and Trump shared the stage at a massive rally.\n\nIn his meeting on Thursday with Goyal, Ross said he will discuss ways South Asia's largest economy can take advantage of the ongoing trade tensions with China.\n\nExpectations of a trade deal being struck between the two countries remain but it may not be a comprehensive one, according to Chandrajit Banerjee, the director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry.\n\n\"I am pretty much positive that both U.S. and India would definitely move towards some sort of a deal, which might not be a comprehensive one, but in bits and pieces, there are many gives and takes that both sides could do,\" he told CNBC. \"I see no reason why we will not be able to moderate our position in some of them.\"\n\nHe added that both New Delhi and Washington acknowledge the importance of the other as a trading partner. When asked about the impact of the U.S. removing India from the GSP program, Banerjee said the move mostly hurt small or medium-sized companies. Reinstating that preference for India is going to factor in the negotiations, he explained.", "description": "U.S. Commerce Sectary Wilbur Ross said India needs to take strong, decisive actions for Washington and New Delhi to reach a trade agreement.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105552724-1541429611990gettyimages-860564356.jpeg?v=1570102264"}
