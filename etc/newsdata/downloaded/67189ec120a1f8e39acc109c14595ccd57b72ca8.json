Here he reveals what brought it on", "language": "en", "text": "Rick Astley is the kind of man who, if he were $20 up at a casino in Vegas, would call it a night. He\u2019s the epitome of knowing how to quit when you\u2019re ahead.\n\nAnd, a millionaire at the age of 27 with a string of number ones after his first hit Never Gonna Give You Up \u2013 which topped the charts in 25 countries in 1987 \u2013 he did just that.\n\nOne day in 1993, on his way to Heathrow to fly to New York, he had a breakdown on the M4 \u2013 not one a mechanic can fix.\n\nRick Astley (pictured) said that he left the music scene as he wanted to be with his family instead\n\nThe 80s hero famously sung 'Never Gonna Give You Up', which topped the charts in 25 countries worldwide. Pictured performing at the Brit Awards in London in 1988\n\nRick Astley performed the new album 'Beautiful Life' ten years after his last album was released. Pictured at the Events Apollo, London on 9 November 2018\n\nIt was an emotional breakdown brought on by the terror of leaving his wife Lene and baby girl Emilie at home. He wasn\u2019t a good flier anyway, and he\u2019d seen how fame can destroy relationships.\n\nHe now had a choice to make: family or fame. So, having sold millions of records, he skipped the flight and retired.\n\n\u2018Having Emilie in 1992 changed what I wanted in life,\u2019 he says. \u2018The music business is littered with people losing the plot.\n\n'I was already taking trains and driving in Europe, I didn\u2019t want to fly any more. I had control over nothing. I\u2019d made enough money to say, \u201cI don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\u2019\n\nAnd so he pretty much disappeared for more than ten years, until an invitation to join the 80s tribute tour Here And Now in 2007.\n\nSpeaking about his decision to quit the business, Rick said that he had to choose between his family and fame. Pictured at San Remo Music Festival in Italy, February 1988\n\n\u2018I\u2019d always said I was over it, but I got an offer to go to Japan, and Lene and Emilie wanted to go.\n\n'It was with other groups of my era, heritage acts, has-beens, whatever you call us. I loved it.\u2019\n\nBut it was the internet phenomenon Rickrolling the same year that had everyone talking about Rick Astley again.\n\nMy voice has become mature. It's more me\n\nPranksters put a link to the video for Never Gonna Give You Up into random websites.\n\nWhen users clicked on it, the video popped up unexpectedly. Within a year more than 18 million people had been Rickrolled.\n\n\u2018People would pay a fortune for that exposure,\u2019 he laughs.\n\nHe dabbled with the odd single until, when he was about to hit 50 three years ago, he wrote new songs inspired by his life.\n\nThe popular singer pretty much disappeared for more than ten years. Pictured here in star-studded New York in 1988\n\nHe recorded them in his garage, played every instrument, and called the album 50.\n\nThe No 1 record went platinum and now he\u2019s releasing a greatest hits album, The Best Of Me, featuring his spectacularly deep voice and new versions of his Stock Aitken Waterman back catalogue alongside the originals.\n\n\u2018If the songs are 30 years old, you want to do something different, but people still want them,\u2019 he says of hits such as Together Forever.\n\nHis voice is different now, richer with the emotions of a life lived.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s matured over the years,\u2019 he says. \u2018A great thing about working from home is there\u2019s no clock ticking'.\n\n'If I\u2019m in the mood, I\u2019ll sing. But if my voice doesn\u2019t get better I\u2019ll say, \u201cLet\u2019s leave it as it is.\u201d It\u2019s more me, this voice.\u2019\n\nHe doesn\u2019t mind being called a heritage act \u2013 he\u2019s cool now in a way he wasn\u2019t before.\n\nEven Foo Fighters\u2019 Dave Grohl is a fan \u2013 in 2017 he dragged Rick up on stage in Japan. \u2018I\u2019d had a few beers, I was jet-lagged,\u2019 says Rick.\n\nRick has written a new album based on songs inspired by his life with his family. Pictured on This Morning on 19 December 2018\n\n\u2018I was watching them on stage when Dave had me up to sing Never Gonna Give You Up!\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s far from his humble beginnings, singing in a church choir in Lancashire.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re in a gang, that\u2019s what bands are,\u2019 he says. \u2018My parents divorced when I was four, and that time was unhappy'.\n\nRICK BY NUMBERS 40 million The number of records Rick had sold before he retired in 1993 1990 The year he turned down the chance to sing the title track for the hit film Pretty Woman Eight His first eight singles hit the Top Ten in the UK, a Guinness World Record 16 The age Rick was when he left school to work for his dad's gardening business and joined a Beatles tribute band\n\n'I lived with Dad, but Mum was around the corner. I was the youngest of five but their second child David died of meningitis before I was born.\u2019\n\nWas David\u2019s death a catalyst for their split?\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think that was the only thing. I was young but I knew something wasn\u2019t right, so it was nice to get out of the house. A choir\u2019s not rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but it is music.\u2019\n\nHis talents come from his parents.\n\n\u2018My mum was a professional pianist until a few years ago and my father has a big, powerful voice.\n\nHe\u2019d sing Frank Sinatra around the house, although his lyrics were never quite the same! Because of him, I was never shy about singing.\n\n\u2018I became the frontman of a band after joining as the drummer, and Pete Waterman saw us and liked my voice.\n\n'He wasn\u2019t a big deal then, but he had a studio in London. I was writing songs, but I worked there as a tea boy to learn more.\u2019\n\nHis first single Never Gonna Give You Up was a huge hit, and as the Stock Aitken Waterman juggernaut picked up steam with the likes of Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Sinitta, Rick had seven more Top Ten singles over the next four years.\n\n\u2018But Stock Aitken Waterman started making it about themselves, not their artists. They felt, \u201cIt\u2019s our productions that are doing it.\u201d Besides me, not many of their artists wrote their own songs.\n\n'I guess I was naive to think that as a pop star I should have some say in what I was doing. But it was all getting monotonous.\u2019\n\nAll of this contributed to his meltdown. But now, Rick\u2019s back.\n\n\u2018With Stock Aitken Waterman, I was just a kid. But I still see Pete, he pops up at things. I was lucky to meet him at the right time.\u2019\n\nAnd to quit while he was ahead.\n\nThe Best Of Me by Rick Astley (BMG) is out on Friday 25 October.", "description": "Rick Astley suffered an emotional breakdown on his way to Heathrow airport when he was due to fly to New York.
