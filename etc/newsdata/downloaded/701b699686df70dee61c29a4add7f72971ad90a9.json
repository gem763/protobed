You always want to play the best,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you schedule the games.\u201d\n\nPurdue coach Jeff Brohm hasn\u2019t provided many hints about Sindelar\u2019s status since announcing the injury Monday. Sindelar did not practice Tuesday but was on the field Wednesday during the portion open to the media. On Wednesday night, Brohm told radio listeners he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Sindelar, the national leader in yards passing, would play.\n\nIf he can\u2019t go, the Boilermakers (1-1) would likely turn to Jack Plummer, a redshirt freshman who has not yet taken a snap in college.\n\nThe uncertainty forced Patterson and TCU\u2019s defensive staff to dig deep into the film vault to prepare.\n\n\u201cWe broke down their spring game, so we got a chance to watch their quarterback,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cThe other guy who plays because Sindelar didn\u2019t play in the spring game, the other guy (Plummer) took all the reps. They run the same, to be honest with you, with both of them they run the same offense.\u201d\n\nThe good news: TCU (1-0) had some extra time to get ready after taking last week off and has some experience working against two quarterbacks - its own.\n\nMax Duggan and Alex Delton split the workload in a season-opening blowout over Arkansas-Pine Bluff and that poses a different kind of obstacle for the Boilermakers.\n\n\u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to spread you out. They\u2019re going to do a lot of things. You\u2019re going to have to defend in space,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to get better at. We are pretty decent when guys load the box and put guys in there. We\u2019ve got to get better when teams spread the field, and that means a mixture of playing coverage but it\u2019s still a mixture of getting after the quarterback.\u201d\n\nBAILEY OUT\n\nDefending TCU becomes even harder for Purdue, which will be without its top two defenders Saturday. Defensive tackle Lorenzo Neal was ruled out by Brohm as he continues to recover from knee surgery and Wednesday linebacker Markus Bailey went down in practice with a season-ending knee injury. Brohm said it was a non-contact injury and would require surgery. Through two games, Bailey had 14 tackles, second on the team. He is a fifth-year senior and a captain.\n\nFEATURE ATTRACTIONS\n\nPurdue\u2019s Rondale Moore and TCU\u2019s Jalen Reagor could produce one of the most entertaining games of the weekend. The two game-breaking receivers possess similar skills, similar styles and helped their defenses get ready for one another this week. Reagor, a second-team all-conference selection and TCU\u2019s MVP last season, fumbled a punt and caught only five passes for 71 yards in the season-opener. Moore, a first-team All-American last season, already has 24 catches for 344 yards and three scores in two games.\n\nSACKING OUT\n\nOne of the Horned Frogs\u2018 trademark features is a suffocating defense that pressures quarterbacks. But in Week 1, TCU only posted two sacks.\n\n\u201cThere are three ways you get sacks,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cEither you have the people with the ability with people to do it themselves, you have to do it within the scheme or you have to manufacture them. That\u2019s what I told them. If you guys don\u2019t want me twisting you and doing all these different things, then what you have to do is you have to show me that you can run by people on your own.\u201d\n\nGOING LONG\n\nMoore\u2019s presence has helped the Boilermakers stretch the field and they\u2019ve taken advantage. Purdue leads the nation with 19 passing plays of 20 or more yards this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "TCU coach Gary Patterson embraces a good challenge.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/ark_pine_bluff_tcu_football_66480_c0-385-3600-2483_s1770x1032.jpg?05e6a388e87e46ad3fa96137864e360d13a490b5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
