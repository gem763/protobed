More broadly, a reporter cannot truly tell these stories, however powerfully they do it, in isolation from the policies that led there. Politics is about who gets hurt, and when you are telling the stories of those who got hurt, it\u2019s dishonest not to point out who\u2019s hurting them, and how.\n\n\n\nIn this way, omitting mention of the way Republicans have road-blocked Medicaid expansion is a kind of malpractice, because it denies those readers the concrete means to demand change. The idea that readers are somehow better off for setting the petty politics of health care policy aside is a classic example of a solution in search of a problem. There\u2019s value in a story that generates sympathy for our fellow citizens, caught in this predicament. But this value is magnified when you can give the readers something concrete about what\u2014and who\u2014is causing it in the first place.\n\n\n\nYes, in Washington, there are two bickering sides over Medicaid, in that one party wants it and the other does not. One side wants to expand Medicaid in the dreadfully limited way that the Affordable Care Act allowed, to cover everyone who makes less than 138 percent of the absurdly low poverty line, instead of keeping it limited to certain categories of unfortunate person deemed more deserving. The other side does not want to expand Medicaid at all, even though the federal government would cover the majority of the cost, and is okay with more people dying if that\u2019s the consequence, which it is.\n\n\n\nMedicaid expansion is only a \u201cpartisan fight\u201d when it\u2019s viewed through a Beltway lens.\n\nBut among the public, Medicaid is broadly loved: 74 percent of voters have a favorable view of Medicaid overall. And when you shift the scene to states in which Republicans dominate politics, this affection holds: 60 percent of voters in deep-red Idaho voted to expand Medicaid with no work requirements; 53 percent of voters in Nebraska and Utah did the same. Medicaid expansion is only a \u201cpartisan fight\u201d when it\u2019s viewed through a Beltway lens. There\u2019s no reason in the world why Saslow has to ruthlessly maintain this point of view in the course of his storytelling\u2014the only thing he\u2019s ensuring by doing so is that his readers will emerge from those stories ill-equipped to fight back.\n\n\n\nAnd lawmakers could use all the help they can get. In order to save the lives of those in these underserved rural communities under Trump, some state Democrats have had to contend with Republicans holding Medicaid hostage to the establishment of vicious work requirements, which exist to punish the poor. In states like Virginia and New Hampshire, Democrats compromised with Republicans to allow the state to impose work requirements in exchange for expanding Medicaid\u2014though in Virginia, those requirements won\u2019t kick in for years, and a judge blocked New Hampshire\u2019s requirements, weeks after the governor delayed their implementation because it became clear they were likely to kick off 68 percent of those subject to it.\n\n", "description": "It does your readers no good to keep them at a remove from the partisan politics that built this calamitous system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e884f7e39354c29c237cfaa2a25fce67aeb6656b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
