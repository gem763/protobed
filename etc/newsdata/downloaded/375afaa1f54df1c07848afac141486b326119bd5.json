The field was racing left, treating the consensus on progressive Twitter as though it were a simulacrum of the real Democratic Party. On some issues, like a higher minimum wage and more generous Social Security benefits, bold left-wing positions really do capture strong political majorities. But on other issues, many candidates have exposed themselves to damaging general election attacks: on reparations for slavery, decriminalizing the border, and giving health-care coverage to undocumented immigrants, among others\u2026\n\nIndeed, two candidates seem to have realized this problem. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have dropped out of the left-wing arms race and begun positioning themselves as heirs to the Obama style of optimism and uplift. But it\u2019s already getting late, and each candidate has already devoted most of the time between their launch and the Iowa caucuses trying to avoid getting dragged on Twitter. What\u2019s more, the fact that both Harris and Booker are trying to squeeze into the same political space increases the probability that neither will achieve escape velocity\u2026\n\nIf Biden isn\u2019t up to this, he needs to collapse soon enough for another mainstream liberal Democrat like Booker or Harris to take his place. Yet it\u2019s at least as easy to imagine he will stay in the race, locking down the party\u2019s center, while Sanders and Warren continue to try to outflank each other on the left. There\u2019s still some time for the race to change. At the moment, the most dire scenario looks disconcertingly real.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait", "Nymag.Com Intelligencer Democrats-Presidential-Candidates-Old-Radical-Biden-Warren-Bernie.Html"], "top_image": ""}
