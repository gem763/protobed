I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\"\n\nLeBron James on how he felt the NBA handled the situation in China and why he didn\u2019t speak out <a href=\"https://t.co/6DYCAs96IW\">pic.twitter.com/6DYCAs96IW</a> \u2014@MarkG_Medina\n\nWhen asked to clarify his thoughts, James went further.\n\n\"I believe [Morey] was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation, and if he was, then so be it,\" James said. \"But I have no idea. That's just my belief. When you say things or do things, you're doing it and you know the people that can be affected by it, and the families and the individuals and everyone that can be affected by it. Sometimes things can be challenging as well. Also sometimes, social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well. But that's just my belief.\"\n\nLakers\u2019 LeBron James on NBA\u2019s China controversy: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a ... feud with Daryl Morey but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/KKrMNU0dKR\">pic.twitter.com/KKrMNU0dKR</a> \u2014@BenGolliver\n\nJames didn't play when the Lakers hosted the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center on Monday night, just two days after they returned home from their bizarre trip to China.\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014@KingJames My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014@KingJames James' comments set off swift reaction on social media, with many listeners perceiving his comments as criticism of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. James addressed the issue again in two tweets prior to Monday's game.\n\nA typical NBA pre-season promotional swing through Shanghai and Shenzhen became something else when Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters while the Lakers were in the air on their 13-hour flight to China.\n\nThe Lakers landed amid outrage with Morey's since-deleted tweet and the NBA in general. The league and Chinese authorities decided to hold no media availability or community events with the Lakers or the Brooklyn Nets, their opponents.\n\nThe Lakers passed their week in China in public silence. Although the exhibition games weren't cancelled, the league claimed it would be unfair to ask players and coaches to speak on the delicate geopolitical argument in which they found themselves involuntarily enmeshed.\n\nSo the players spent most of the week in hotels or on the court, with two NBA Cares events, a fan event and other public appearances all cancelled by the league or the government. Several companies and state-run offices reportedly severed their ties with the NBA over Morey's tweet and the league's response to it.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on the political side of the events in China, James echoed Warriors coach Steve Kerr's belief that he wasn't educated enough to comment on the situation.\n\n\"When I speak about something, I speak about something I am very knowledgeable about, something that hits home for me, something that I am very passionate about,\" James said. \"I felt like with this particular situation, it was something that not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that not only myself and my teammates or our organization had enough information to even talk about it at that point in time, and we still feel the same way.\"\n\nA Rockets spokesperson didn't immediately respond to request for comment Monday night on James' remarks.", "description": "LeBron James believes Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey \"was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation\" and the potential consequences of his actions when he tweeted in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5320863.1571106543!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/china-nba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
