We are committed to ensuring that mandate is implemented in full and that Ramaphosa\u2019s presidency delivers on jobs,\u201d said Losi.\n\nHer federation has, however, been accused of compromising its mandate of placing workers\u2019 interests first and treating Ramaphosa\u2019s government with kid gloves due to the close relationship.\n\nThis is an accusation that Losi has dismissed as unfounded.\n\n\u201cYes, Cosatu is close to the president, proudly so, as he is a son of Cosatu [alluding to Ramaphosa\u2019s tenure as a trade union leader in both the Council of Unions of SA and NUM, the National Union of Mineworkers]. We have given him a clear mandate to save jobs, the country\u2019s economy and rid the state of corruption. He is doing well. He is not a magician. We all need to come to the party as government, business and labour,\u201d said Losi.\n\nShe said when \u201cthe ANC and the government [make] blunders, we intervene in the interest of workers and the working class in this country\u201d.\n\nLosi said the union\u2019s proximity to Ramaphosa was actually positive because it ensured that Cosatu had the president\u2019s ear and could tell him when the government or the ANC made mistakes \u201cand we engage them to fix these\u201d.\n\n\u201cCosatu\u2019s mandate is to unite and organise workers, we advance members interests on all fronts irrespective of who\u2019s in power, be it ANC nationally or the DA in Cape Town or the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] in KwaZulu-Natal municipalities,\u201d said Losi.\n\n\u201cWe fought hard to ensure his election and to give the ANC a clear anticorruption, pro-worker election mandate. We are committed to ensuring that mandate is implemented in full and that Ramaphosa\u2019s presidency delivers on jobs Zingiswa Losi\n\nCosatu had been lobbying to have Ramaphosa address mine workers in Marikana during workers\u2019 day next year.\n\nCosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said the presidency had \u201cagreed in principle\u201d.\n\n\n\nAs proof that Cosatu was not soft on government, Losi recounted how under her administration, \u201cNehawu [National Education, Health and Allied Workers\u2019 Union] has led mass strikes. Popcru [Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union] has forced the SA Police Service to improve members\u2019 conditions. Denosa [Democratic Nursing Organisation] has mobilised to improve nursing allowances, training and employment. Sadtu [SA Democratic Teachers\u2019 Union] has ensured the education department addresses teacher safety. NUM defied Eskom management which wanted to cut wages and retrench. CWU [Communication Workers Union] has saved SABC jobs. Samwu [SA Municipal Workers\u2019 Union] has fought to ensure municipalities pay what is due to workers, to name but a few\u201d.\n\nLosi served as Cosatu\u2019s second deputy president from 2009 until her unopposed election as president to lead a federation with more than 1.6 million members in September last year.\n\nShe emphasised that Cosatu\u2019s \u201cmandate starts and stops with the needs of workers, unapologetically so\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe president, at our insistence, held progressive jobs and investment summits to drive the economy\u2019s revival. We now meet the president and Cabinet and top business leaders monthly to deal with its implementation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Cosatu political and organisational reports released in September last year, the federation\u2019s membership continued to decline after the expulsion of its biggest affiliate, the National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) with Cosatu haemorrhaging 317 463 members from 2015 to last year.\n\nLosi claims to have stemmed the tide.\n\n\u201cMany had written Cosatu off saying we were a weak spent force. This has changed drastically and decisively. Cosatu today is stable, healing and growing. Many unions are now applying to join Cosatu. Membership has stabilised and is now growing across all sectors.\u201d\n\nCosatu president Zingiswa Losi says the trade federation is not ashamed of its proximity to President Cyril Ramaphosa and uses that opportunity to help correct his mistakes.\n\nThe latest Cosatu political and organisational report has not been released but Losi said unions which had been bleeding workers \u201cwere now working closely with Cosatu leadership to deal with the challenges, to clean up, do forensic audits, go to congress and get their houses back on track\u201d.\n\n\n\nLosi said members of the SA Communist Party (SACP) \u2013 a tripartite alliance partner \u2013 had threatened to go it alone in the upcoming municipal elections.\n\nShe said the party was an independent organisation with the freedom to do as it wished.\n\n\u201cThe SACP is an ally yes, but remains independent. It makes its own decisions based upon its members\u2019 views and analysis and we cannot speak on its behalf or dictate what it can and cannot do. We respect its views,\u201d Losi said.", "description": "Cosatu president Zingiswa Losi says the trade federation is not ashamed of its proximity to President Cyril Ramaphosa and uses that opportunity to help correct his mistakes.", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9533/412957ffe2b14124b0cddda79259752c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
