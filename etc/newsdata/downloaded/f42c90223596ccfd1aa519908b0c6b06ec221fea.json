The filament-like feature was probably a glitch in the telescope, or something clouding the field of view, he decided. It shouldn\u2019t be here, he thought, and stripped it out of his data.\n\nBut the mystery filament kept showing up, and soon Yusef-Zadeh found others. What the astronomer had mistaken for an imperfection turned out to be an entire population of cosmic structures at the heart of the galaxy.\n\nMore than 100 filaments have been detected since Yusef-Zadeh\u2019s first encounter in the early 1980s. Astronomers can\u2019t completely explain them, but they have given them familiar labels, naming them after the earthly things they resemble: the pelican, the mouse, the snake. The menagerie of filaments is clustered around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been found elsewhere,\u201d says Yusef-Zadeh, a physics and astronomy professor at Northwestern University.", "description": "A damage report on the presidency by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Eliot Cohen, and Jack Goldsmith.
