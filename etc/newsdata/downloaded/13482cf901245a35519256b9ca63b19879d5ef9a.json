But I missed the bed and fell over.\"\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nShe added: \"I had to have an operation, be written out of some scenes and take time off \u2013 which I hate doing as I don't like letting people down. But everyone was so lovely.\"\n\nSue also joked about the poor timing of her accident.\n\nShe said: \"This all happened after I got my Outstanding Achievement Award [at the 2019 British Soap Awards] \u2013 serves me right for being big-headed!\"\n\nSue also said there's no way she'll be leaving the soap any time soon.\n\n(Image: David Fisher/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nShe said: \"Friends say to me, 'Oh, are you going to do another year?' And I think, 'Well, if they ask me, why wouldn't I?'\n\n\"It's almost as if they're saying, 'Well you're 70 plus now...' But I love this job \u2013 in fact I've loved it more these last few years than I've ever done.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
