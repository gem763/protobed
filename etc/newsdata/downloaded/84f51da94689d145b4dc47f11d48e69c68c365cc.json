The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.84% was down 0.8 basis point to 2.276%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nU.K\u2019s Parliament will vote on whether lawmakers agree on principle with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal as he looks to ratify his proposal before Oct. 31. Even if Johnson\u2019s plan gets approved the vote, analysts say there remains opportunities for opposition lawmakers to scupper his tentative agreement.\n\nEither way, investors say the probability of a no-deal Brexit has dimmed, soothing a longstanding source of geopolitical concerns that has driven investors into government bonds.\n\nIn economic data, existing-home sales for September are due at 10 a.m. Eastern. MarketWatch-polled analysts expect sales to run at an annual pace of 703,000.\n\nSeparately, the Treasury Department will auction $40 billion of 2-year notes on 1 p.m. at Tuesday, amid worries that primary dealers\u2019 balance sheets are bloated with government paper.\n\nTo take down the U.S. government\u2019s rising debt issuance, market participants said some dealers may have been unwilling to use their reserves at the Federal Reserve to finance the purchases and instead used funds from the so-called repo market. This exacerbated the demand for cash and added to the strains in markets for short-term borrowing that had flared up earlier in September.\n\nWhat did market participants\u2019 say?\n\n\u201cBrexit approval by Parliament is once again front and center,\u201d said Tom di Galoma, managing director of Treasurys trading at Seaport Global Securities.\n\n\u201cEquities are treading water ahead of the U.K. Parliament drama. Many feel this vote will not end well hence the \u201crisk-off\u201d move we are seeing,\u201d said di Galoma.", "description": "U.S. Treasury yields fall Tuesday ahead of the first debt auction of the week as fixed-income traders closely eye a vote on U.K. Prime Minister Boris...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
