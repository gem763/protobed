He waived his no-movement clause to facilitate a trade with the Carolina Hurricanes, who tried to convince him to join them, but was bought out and ended back in San Jose on a one-year deal.\n\nKevin Labanc scored for San Jose, and Martin Jones stopped 25 shots.\n\nOn the winner, Rielly took a pass from William Nylander off the rush and went upstairs on Jones.\n\nWith Jones off for an extra attacker. Kasperi Kapanen inexplicably missed the empty net from in tight, but Mikheyev iced it with 47.5 seconds left. Matthews then scored his ninth with Jones back in goal.\n\nMatthews took a big hit from defenseman Brenden Dillon midway through the second period after delivering a pass at the offensive blue line. The Toronto center finished his shift and drew a tripping penalty, but headed to the locker room after returning to the bench. Matthews returned for the third period.\n\nNOTES: Marleau was honored with a video tribute during the first television timeout. ... Toronto was 0 for 5 on the power play.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSharks: At Ottawa on Sunday night.\n\nMaple Leafs: At Montreal on Saturday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
