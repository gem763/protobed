It\u2019s a team full of world-class players and to be given the chance to work with some of the players who I worked with a few years ago is really exciting. I can\u2019t wait to get started and see where we can get to.\n\n\u201cEngland are the current 50-over world champions and they made it to the final of the last ICC Women\u2019s T20 World Cup.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a very competitive side and they wouldn\u2019t be in big matches like that if they didn\u2019t have a really strong group of players who can perform on the big stage. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting under way and helping the team progress.\u201d\n\nClare Connor, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s managing director of women\u2019s cricket, said Keightley was the stand-out candidate for the job.\n\nLisa Keightley, pictured in action against England, is relishing her new role (David Davies/PA)\n\n\u201cShe outlined clear plans as to how she believes she can take the team and this group of players forward,\u201d Connor said.\n\n\u201cLisa will become the first full-time female head coach of the England Women\u2019s team. I am excited about the progress our sport continues to make and I\u2018m sure that Lisa\u2019s appointment will rightly be seen as another huge step for women\u2019s cricket.\u201d\n\nAlastair Maiden will remain in interim charge until Keightley\u2019s duties with the Scorchers are complete.\n\nKeightley had been due to work as women\u2019s head coach for London Spirit in The Hundred next year, but will now not take up that role.", "description": "Keightley will be a familiar face for many players.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/09/wire-20366960-1572428057-945_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
