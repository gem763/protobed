REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\n\u201cSo now they are after the legendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHe may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe New York Times reported late on Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan were investigating Giuliani\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine as part of a case involving two of his business associates, Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman.\n\nThe two men, who helped Giuliani investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden and his businessman son Hunter, were arrested on Thursday over what U.S. prosecutors called a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other political candidates.\n\nAsked about the Times report, Giuliani told Reuters: \u201cI never did any lobbying for anyone. If they want to ask me I\u2019m happy to prove it. But they haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nTrump sowed confusion about his relationship with Giuliani on Friday, responding to a question about whether he was still his personal attorney: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry against Trump on Friday that the president ousted her based on \u201cunfounded and false claims\u201d after she came under attack by Giuliani.\n\nThe inquiry is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is a leading rival seeking to face Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGiuliani has accused Yovanovitch of blocking efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump defended his attorney Rudy Giuliani on Saturday as a \"legendary crime buster\" and \"wonderful lawyer\" after a media report that prosecutors are investigating whether the former New York mayor broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["David Morgan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440099589&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0H2", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
