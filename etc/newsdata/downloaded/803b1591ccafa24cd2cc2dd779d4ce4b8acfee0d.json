That is potentially awkward for Moscow which backs the Syrian army with air power, but also enjoys warm ties with Turkey.\n\nAsked if Moscow was worried that Russia could get sucked into a conflict with Turkish forces because of its backing for the Syrian army, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that was the last thing it wanted.\n\n\"We wouldn\u00b4t even like to think about that scenario,\" Peskov told reporters.\n\nPeskov said Moscow had already warned all sides in the Syrian conflict to avoid any action that could escalate tensions in the area or damage a fragile political process.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan said earlier on Monday that he did not envisage any problems would emerge in Syria's Kobani after a Syrian army deployment is executed along the border.\n\nErdogan spoke of what he called Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"positive approach\" to Turkey's actions.\n\nThe Kremlin has said previously it is sympathetic to Ankara's need to address security concerns in northern Syria. Peskov declined to comment on Monday when asked if Moscow felt it was time for Turkey to end its operation inside Syria.\n\nAsked if Erdogan was coordinating the Turkish offensive with Putin, Peskov said:\n\n\"Contacts between the Russian and Turkish authorities are happening. In particular, there was a phone call (between the presidents), and phone conversations between the foreign ministers. There are also communication channels between the (two) militaries.\" (Reporting by Tom Balmforth, Maria Kiselyova, Andrew Osborn Editing by Andrew Osborn)", "description": "MOSCOW, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday it did  not want to entertain the possibility of a clash in Syria  between Russian and Turkish forces...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
