The star went from $53 million in person debt to making $150 million a year. USA TODAY\n\nJames Corden and Kanye West took to the skies for \"Airpool Karaoke\" for Monday's \"Late Late Show,\" a play on \"Carpool Karaoke\" filmed in a large plane.\n\nDuring their conversation, the rapper who finally dropped his anticipated new album \"Jesus Is King,\" spoke openly about his marriage to Kim Kardashian, his finances and his relationship with God.\n\nWest deemed his union to Kim Kardashian a feat. The two wed in Italy in May 2014.\n\n\u201cMarriage years are different than human years. Like, you know how dog years \u2013 what is it seven years?\" he said. \"Every marriage year is like 100 years. It\u2019s like 500 years of marriage.\"\n\nOn a typical weeknight, West says he refrains from going out in order to spend time with his wife and four kids.\n\n\"I like being at home with my family at night as much as possible,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll eat dinner and we\u2019ll play with the kids and then we\u2019ll put the kids to bed and then we go to bed. And then my wife watches 'Dateline.'\"\n\nWhat's West doing during that time? \"I read the Bible.\"\n\nMichael Che called out for misgendering Caitlyn Jenner on 'SNL,' joke deemed 'transphobic'\n\nWhen Corden assessed that the marriage has been \"a real great stabler\" for the musician, West agreed. \"People thought it would be uncool to be married. Then I got married and people were like, 'Oh, that looks cool,' \" he said.\n\nCorden couldn't help but interject. \"No one ever thought it would be uncool to marry Kim Kardashian. Everybody thought it would be cool to marry Kim Kardashian,\" he said.\n\n\"Well not Kris Humphries,\" West quickly quipped back, referencing Kardashian's second husband whom she famously filed for divorce from after only 72 days of marriage.\n\nKanye West requested those working on 'Jesus is King' to 'fast,' 'not have premarital sex'\n\n\"It's more than cool,\" West added. \"It's more than 'cool as hell' or something. It's heavenly. It's great. It's magnificent.\"\n\nHe sees his union as one of his many blessings from above.\n\n\"As humbly as I can put it, He\u2019s using me to show off,\" the musician said. \"Last year, I made $115 million and still ended up $35 million in debt. This year, I looked up, and I just got $68 million returned to me on my tax returns. And people say, 'Oh, don't talk about these numbers.' No, people need to hear someone that had been put into debt by the system talk about these kind of numbers now that they\u2019re in service to Christ.\"\n\nWest came in first on Forbes list of hip hop stars with the biggest paydays for 2019. The outlet reports her made $150 million of \"pretax income from June 2018 to June 2019 before deducting fees for agents, managers and lawyers.\"\n\nReview: Kanye West finds God (and Chick-fil-A) on frustrating new album 'Jesus is King'\n\nWest revealed the idea for his Sunday Service, which has been attended by Brad Pitt and other celebs, came to him at a challenging time.\n\n\"Actually, when I went to the hospital, a few years ago, I wrote in the hospital, 'Start a church in Calabasas,'\" he recalled. \"It's something I had a feeling that I needed to do that God put on my heart, and now He just keeps on taking me to new levels and taking us to other levels that we didn't even imagine before.\"\n\nWest said he believes the strife he experienced is an instrument that God is using.\n\nKanye West and James Corden film \"Airpool Karaoke\" for \"The Late Late Show.\" (Photo: Terence Patrick/CBS)\n\n\"I think He wanted me to suffer more and wanted people to see my suffering and see my pain and put stigmas on me and have me go through all the experiences \u2013 the human experiences \u2013 so now when I talk about how Jesus saved me, more people can relate to that experience,\" said West. \"If it was just, 'Oh, we grew up with this guy's music, and now he's a superstar,' it\u2019s less compelling than, 'Oh, this guy had a mental break down. This guy was in debt.'\"\n\nLooking back on his life and struggles, West said, \"I have no regret and no shame.\u201d\n\n'Dancing With the Stars' pro Val Chmerkovskiy epically responds to Kanye's diss lyric\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/29/kanye-west-james-corden-karaoke-rapper-talks-kim-kardashian-money/2494122001/", "description": "James Corden and Kanye West took to the skies for \"Airpool Karaoke,\"\u00a0and he joked about Kris Humphries and said he got $68M back from his taxes.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
