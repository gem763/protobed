We also look at the ongoing situation between the NBA and China, as well as some companies set to report Q3 earnings results next week, and why marijuana stock Cronos Group CRON is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nU.S. stocks popped Thursday morning after President Trump tweeted \u201cBig day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.\u201d The announcement, which comes as top U.S. and Chinese officials start two days of trade meetings in Washington, helped push Dow components such as Caterpillar CAT and Intel INTC up big.\n\nStill, many on Wall Street remain cautious and somewhat pessimistic that a trade deal gets done, especially as broader, non-tariff issues such as the U.S. blacklist of Chinese firms like Huawei, grows. Meanwhile, the ongoing fight between the NBA and China, which started with Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey\u2019s support of Hong Kong protestors, could have significant ramifications. With that said, the preseason game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets was played in Shanghai Thursday.\n\nThe NBA, Nike NKE, Adidas ADDYY, and many other businesses have millions of dollars riding on the continued expansion of the world\u2019s largest basketball league in China, including Nets owner Joseph Tsai, who co-founded Alibaba BABA.\n\nMoving on, Delta DAL stock slipped Thursday, which means Wall Street will now look to United\u2019s UAL quarterly results next week. The firm is part of a group of more than 150 companies set to report their quarterly financial results, including JPMorgan Chase JPM, Netflix NFLX, and other giants (also read: Here's What to Expect as Q3 Earnings Season Revs Up).\n\nWe then close with why Cronos stock looks like a buy after four of the largest Canadian marijuana stocks, Aurora, Tilray, Canopy, and CRON, have been crushed.\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\n\n\nEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.\n\n\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\n\n\nToday, See These 5 Potential Home Runs >>\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
