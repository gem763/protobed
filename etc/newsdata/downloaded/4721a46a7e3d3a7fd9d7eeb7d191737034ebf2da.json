As she reached the crescendo of Over the Rainbow \u2013 the song which made her a global star aged just 17 \u2013 it was unknown to the audience that they were watching her final live performance. Four months later, 47 year-old Garland was found dead in Chelsea, London, after accidentally overdosing on the drugs she had self-medicated with since childhood. One of the headlines would read: \u201cJudy\u2019s voice stilled. The rainbow is gone.\u201d\n\nFifty years on, Garland superfan Ross Semple, 27, still listens to that Copenhagen concert religiously. \u201cI cry every time I listen to that recording,\u201d he says. \u201cThe pain in her voice, knowing what was to come soon after, you can hear it all.\u201d Having seen The Wizard of Oz as a child, Ross was further drawn towards Judy Garland in his late teens, around the same time he came out as gay. He began watching her films, listening to her music and learning about her life. \u201cI want to know as much as I can about her,\u201d he explains. \u201cBecause I want to be able to speak with authority about her and understand her, because she deserves that.\u201d\n\nMore like this\n\n- Film\u2019s most shocking moments\n\n- How Friends changed our idea of family\n\n- The best films of 2019 so far\n\nRoss is far from the only gay man to feel such strong affinity with Garland\u2019s work and life. Gay magazine The Advocate once called her the \u201cElvis of homosexuals\u201d, and in a 1967 review of Garland's concert at New York City\u2019s Palace Theatre, Time Magazine observed that a \u201cdisproportionate part of her nightly claque\u201d was gay. Two years earlier, Garland herself had been asked if at a San Francisco press conference if she minded having such a large gay following, to which she responded: \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. I sing to people!\u201d\n\nHomosexuals understand suffering. And so does Garland \u2013 Esquire magazine, 1969\n\nJournalist, author and self-confessed Garland devotee Robert Leleux wrote in the New York Times 2012 that the LGBTQ+ community\u2019s love of Garland \u2013 which he dubbed \u201cJudyism\u201d \u2013 was becoming \u201clittle more than a cultural memory\u201d. But now Judyism may be set to grip a whole new generation with the release of Judy, a biopic starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. Set in 1969, when Garland arrived in London for a five-week run of sold-out concerts, the film received rapturous reviews for Zellweger\u2019s performance when it premiered at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals earlier this month. The buzz surrounding the release, partnered with the 2018 remake of A Star is Born \u2013 the iconic showbiz drama that earned Garland an Academy Award nomination in 1954 \u2013 has brought her distinctly gay legacy back into focus.\n\nTo many gay men, Garland is the mother of all icons. But why? While Garland was still alive, critics made ham-fisted attempts to answer this question. A 1969 review of her Palace Theatre show in Esquire Magazine reads: \u201cHomosexuals tend to identify with suffering. They are a persecuted group and they understand suffering. And so does Garland.\u201d However queer historian Dr Justin Bengry warns against generalising in this way. \u201cIt\u2019s important to ask: for whom is Judy Garland resonant, important and iconic?\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cIt seems to be a significant category of gay men, in particular, who are invested in celebrities or the camp aesthetic that Garland embodies. But it's also important to recognise that they aren't the totality of gay men.\u201d\n\nThe camp that Bengry mentions is significant to Garland\u2019s gay icon status. Queer film historian Jack Babuscio defines camp as \u201cirony, aestheticism, theatricality and humour\u201d \u2013 four pillars that form the foundation of Garland\u2019s public persona. In fact, her life story is practically a blueprint for our modern understanding of what makes a gay icon. Analysing her story, from upbringing to death, helps us understand how and why some gay men look to famous women to help them navigate the world.\n\nSmall town to Tinseltown\n\n\n\nIn 1922, Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm \u2013 named after her parents Frank and Ethel \u2013 in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. When Garland was four, the family moved to California following rumours that her father, a closeted bisexual, had made sexual advances towards young men. After the family settled in California, Ethel Gumm began to promote her daughters as a performing trio, known as The Gumm Sisters. It was Garland\u2019s mother who first introduced her to drugs. According to Gerald Clarke, author of Garland biography Get Happy, Ethel would give her daughters pills in the morning and at night, saying \u201cI\u2019ve got to get those girls going!\u201d Eventually, after her older sisters both married, Garland was signed by studio giant MGM as a teenager on a seven-year contract. At 17, she starred in her breakout role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nLike Judy Garland, gay men are brought up to be ordinary. One is not brought up gay \u2013 Richard Dyer\n\nThis period in Garland\u2019s life, which mirrored closely the story of Dorothy, has contributed significantly to her status as a gay icon. Much like her gingham-dressed alter ego, swept away by the winds into a magical, Technicolor world, Garland was plucked from obscurity to become a cultural icon. In his book, Heavenly Bodies: Film Stars and Society, professor Richard Dyer observes some gay men identify with Garland\u2019s rejection of the ordinariness that she seemed destined for as a child. He theorises that turning out to be abnormal after being \u201csaturated with the values or ordinariness\u201d is a point where Garland and Dorothy\u2019s stories align with the experience of some gay men, encouraging those who perceive themselves as \u2018different\u2019 to gravitate towards her.\n\nBody trouble\n\nGarland\u2019s arrival as a major Hollywood star was complicated by a series of disastrous personal relationships, most notably with herself. From a young age, her self-image was relentlessly criticised by film executives who believed that she was unattractive. Alongside her mother, MGM executives controlled her image and encouraged her to take drugs to stay slim. Critical acclaim for her stand-out performances in Meet Me in St Louis and Till the Clouds Roll By coincided with praise of her \u2018radiant\u2019 appearance. But low points in Garland\u2019s career were often accompanied by drastic weight gain and there were high-profile suicide attempts.\n\nHowever Garland\u2019s body struggles arguably made her a figure of endearment. As culture journalist Anne Helen Petersen told Karina Longworth in a 2014 episode of her podcast You Must Remember This: \u201cJudy didn\u2019t look like the rest of the MGM stars. She became this avatar for the rejected: not sexy enough, not pretty enough.\u201d This physical insecurity is something that many gay men can identify with, in particular, as a demographic more likely to battle body dysmorphia, harm their bodies, attempt suicide and suffer from eating disorders. In the book, Changing Gay Male Identities, Dr Andrew Cooper suggests that the body can be a complex battleground for many gay men: that the body becomes a key site for projecting a \u201csuccessful\u201d sense of self to gay peers, but also for embodying success in the eyes of wider society. With this in mind, is it any wonder gay men relate to Garland\u2019s desire to stay slim and successful?\n\nA survivor is born\n\nGarland\u2019s professional and personal lives were both defined by turbulence. She married five times and two of her husbands were, like her father, suspected of being gay or bisexual. Garland first married at 19 when she eloped to Las Vegas with musician David Rose. A year later, when she fell pregnant, her mother convinced her to have an illegal abortion. Drugs and financial instability were a near-constant presence in her life and she was suspended numerous times by MGM for missing shoot days or being incoherent, intoxicated and abusive on set. At 28, she was eventually dropped by MGM shortly after being replaced by Ginger Rogers on The Barkleys of Broadway (1949).\n\nGarland\u2019s lead role in 1954\u2019s A Star is Born was a comeback moment. At 32, she had already been divorced twice and suffered numerous breakdowns. The high-budget project was seen as her final throw of the dice in Hollywood. Garland\u2019s portrayal of Esther Blodgett, an aspiring singer who becomes tortured by her love interest\u2019s addiction issues, is regarded as one of the greatest film performances of all time. In one pivotal scene, she says: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to watch someone you love crumble away \u2013 bit by bit, day by day, in front of your eyes \u2013 and stand there helpless\u2026 I hate his promises to stop, I hate going home at night and listening to his lies. I hate him for failing and I hate me too.\u201d It is hard to listen to these words without connecting them to her own addiction struggles.\n\nIt annoys me when she gets boiled down to just how tragic she was. It's a disservice to her body of work \u2013 Ross Semple\n\nYet the critical acclaim Garland received for A Star is Born was tarnished by its commercial underperformance. Deemed too long, the film had to be cut considerably, leading to a botched edit that left viewers underwhelmed. It flopped at the box office and Warner Bros then cancelled the lucrative multi-film deal Garland had signed with them. She was widely expected to take home the Academy Award for her role in the film, with reporters even waiting by her hospital bedside to capture her reaction as she prepared to give birth. But the Oscar ended up going to Grace Kelly, signalling that Garland\u2019s Hollywood star was not going to be reignited after all.\n\nAt this point, the motif of Garland as a \u2018survivor\u2019 becomes central to her gay appeal. A Star is Born further blurred the line between her work and life, with Richard Dyer identifying this as the moment where Garland\u2019s image of being \u201cdamaged goods\u201d becomes an essential part of her star persona and gay icon status. He argues that, from then on, Garland\u2019s work and life tells a story of survival, and of someone trying to assert some form of control in a world that was set up to destroy her.\n\nLike a true survivor, Garland rebounded from the commercial failure of A Star is Born. She found a new niche as a live singer, performing in a drug-induced haze on an endless tour after financial troubles left her permanently broke. Audiences, many of whom were gay, roared with laughter at her quick wit and gave her the validation for her performing that she had always craved. A live recording of her 1961 concert at Carnegie Hall in New York won four Grammys, including album of the year, making Garland the first woman to win the award.\n\nSuperfan Semple describes a tension between his admiration for Garland\u2019s work and his fascination with her life story. \u201cIt annoys me when she gets boiled down to just how tragic she was,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause her performances were so brilliant and she made some beautiful films. It's a disservice to her body of work to paint her as solely a tragic figure, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t obsessed with the story behind the curtain too.\u201d He also observes that the gay love for \u201csurvivor\u201d women who have been cast aside continues today. \u201cFemale pop acts who are largely forgotten by mainstream society still headline Pride events every year,\u201d he says. \u201cJudy was an early incarnation of that.\u201d\n\nSome gay men find more affinity in straight female stars than they do in those from their own community, a process that queer academic Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz calls \u201cdisidentification\u201d. He thinks that LGBTQ+ people often assign queerness to characters or stories that are not explicitly queer as a \u201ccoping mechanism\u201d. As an example, Mu\u00f1oz suggests that when a gay man \u201cidentified\u201d with Garland, he was \u201cwriting his way into the mainstream culture in which his own story could never be told.\u201d\n\nGay men often reject gay cultural figures that they perceive as geared towards straight people \u2013 such as the cast members of Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye\n\nBut contrastingly, in the book How to be Gay, queer historian David Halperin describes a tension with the \u201cmainstream\u201d that leads gay men to be \u201chighly critical, if not contemptuous, of their own artists, writers and filmmakers\u201d. He says that gay men often fail to warm to gay characters and celebrities because they \u201cdon\u2019t often like the representations of gay men that gay men produce.\u201d Halperin suggests that this is because most mainstream representations of gay men, from pop culture to politics, pander to \u201cacceptable\u201d heterosexual norms. He draws a key distinction between gay culture \u2013 where \u201cconventional\u201d white gay men are dominant \u2013 and gay subculture \u2013 where women, drag queens, queer people of colour and trans people are more visible. This causes some gay men to reject gay cultural figures that they perceive as geared towards straight people \u2013 such as, to use two very current examples, the cast members of Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye and gay Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigeig. Instead many embrace subcultural \u2013 and in their eyes, more subversive \u2013 female narratives like Garland\u2019s.\n\nSo, depending on which way you look at it, \u201cdisidentifying\u201d with Garland is either gay men\u2019s way of feeling aligned to mainstream culture \u2013 or, in fact, rejecting it wholesale.\n\nAn icon in death\n\nIt is an unavoidable truth that Garland\u2019s tragic and untimely death has also contributed to her status as a gay icon, making her a timeless figure. On the day of Garland\u2019s funeral, gay men lined the streets and wept for her. Dyer notes that, at the time, gathering to watch Garland\u2019s funeral gave them \u201cpermission to be gay in public for once.\u201d But decades later, you don\u2019t have to look far to see how Garland was the first in a continuing lineage of \u2018tragic\u2019 female celebrities who have acquired the status of gay icons.\n\nQueens would come to a Judy Garland concert and then scream at her when she was too drunk to finish it \u2013 Dr Michael Bronski\n\nElements of Garland\u2019s story can be found in that of Diana, Princess of Wales, and her mistreatment at the hands of the press; Princess Margaret, with her ongoing substance issues, and marriage to an exploitative man who was rumoured to be gay; and Britney Spears, whose child stardom culminated in a very public divorce and mental health struggles. From Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston and Kesha, to Lily Allen, Demi Lovato and Garland\u2019s own daughter Liza Minnelli, women continue to be exploited, damaged and, in the worst cases, destroyed by fame.\n\nGay men need to be mindful of our own culpability in this cycle. \u2018Friend of Dorothy\u2019 has long been a popular code word for gay men, but not all friends of Dorothy were friends of Judy. As Dr Michael Bronski, a Harvard University professor and the author of books on queer history and gay culture, asserts in a recent article on the dark side of \u201cstan\u201d (superfan) culture: \"There is a long history of gay male fan culture latching onto famous women and then turning on them. Queens would come to a Judy Garland concert and then scream at her when she was too drunk to finish it. The women have changed \u2013 it's no longer Marlene Dietrich and Judy Garland. But the dynamic remains in Western culture.\u201d\n\nBronski is right: that pattern didn\u2019t end with Garland\u2019s death. Whether it\u2019s Katy Perry becoming, as journalist Brian O\u2019Flynn writes, \u201cgay Twitter\u2019s punching bag\u201d, or gay fans dressing as \u2018bald Britney\u2019 for Halloween and turning up to meet-and-greets dressed in costume from Spears\u2019s infamous 2007 breakdown, gay men can be increasingly fickle towards famous women.\n\nIdolising these women is one thing, but we shouldn\u2019t treat them like playthings for our entertainment. The personal troubles of women like Winona Ryder, Amanda Bynes or Naomi Campbell might generate funny punchlines, but they\u2019re also real-life problems. When push comes to shove, are gay men really there for the women we claim to worship?\n\nOn screen too, there are several works in the gay pop-cultural canon that glorify destructive female behaviour \u2013 while being financed and created by men. Mommie Dearest, a biopic of screen icon Joan Crawford, which portrays her as an abusive mother, is a gay classic. And from the streets of Wisteria Lane to Big Little Lies and the Real Housewives franchise, pop-culture encourages us to love female characters when they\u2019re screaming hysterically, so we can condense their pain into hilariously camp GIFs and say \u201cyassss kween\u201d as they smash up their surroundings.\n\nCamp is a huge part of what draws gay men towards women like Garland. There is camp to be found in her tragedy, her successes and her bad behaviour. But some, such as gay author Andrew Britton have argued that the existence of camp actually depends on the restrictive gender dynamics that it claims to oppose. Much has been written about the suppressive effect of the \u201cmale gaze\u201d on women, but surely the \u201cgay gaze\u201d is also to blame.\n\nFifty years after Garland\u2019s death, her legacy lives on. Many gay men turn to women like Judy Garland to help them navigate their own experiences of the world. But we should also reflect on the way we treat them. Because if we don\u2019t commit to treating the icons who we love with compassion, or creating the \u201ckinder, gentler world\u201d Garland once said she longed for, then are we much better than the people who tried to break her?\n\nJudy is released in the US and Canada on 27 September and in the UK and Ireland on 4 October\n\nLove film?
