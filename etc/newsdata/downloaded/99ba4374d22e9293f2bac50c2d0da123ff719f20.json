It has a hard exterior that can keep it fresh for a long time without refrigeration.\n\nBeneath that tough shell is vivid orange or yellow flesh\u2014a sure sign of the antioxidant beta-carotene. Combined with other antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, vitamins, minerals, and nutrients, winter squash is a mile deep in delicious benefits.\n\nWinter squash delivers a hefty helping of health, and comes in a glorious range of varieties including:\n\nAcorn\n\nBanana\n\nButternut\n\nCalabaza\n\nDelicata\n\nGreen Hubbard\n\nKabocha\n\nPumpkin, Sugar Pumpkin\n\nSpaghetti\n\nSweet Dumpling\n\nWhat makes this tough guy so special?\n\nWinter squash was such an important part of Native Americans' diet that they buried it with their dead for nourishment on their journey to the next world.\n\nBut it can nourish and protect us very well before our own final journey\u2014maybe even delay that journey\u2014for years.\n\nPlenty of research has shown that increasing consumption of winter squash (and many other plant foods) reduces your risk of obesity, heart disease, and mortality from all causes.\n\nWinter squash excels by giving us all this and more:\n\nPrevents high blood pressure, lowers it if present\n\nFor healthy blood pressure, more potassium in your diet is as important as less sodium. That's why it's a true health crisis that 98 percent of U.S. adults fail to meet the recommended daily potassium intake of 4,700 mg, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n\nA cup of cooked winter squash steps up to the plate to deliver 20 percent of that requirement\u2014with zero percent sodium.\n\nReduces your risk of heart attack, stroke, and cancer\n\nWinter squash's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties protect against both heart attack and stroke. In younger men, winter squash's abundant beta-carotene can protect against prostate cancer.\n\nManages diabetes\n\nType 1 diabetics whose diet is rich in fiber have lower overall blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetics have improved blood sugar, lipids, and insulin levels. One cup of butternut squash provides nearly one-third of the recommended fiber for women and nearly one-quarter of the amount for men.\n\nPrevents, reduces obesity\n\nSome recent studies show that the fiber in winter squash can reduce the risk of obesity and help obese individuals shed some extra poundage.\n\nPrevents asthma\n\nA diet high in beta-carotene reduces the risk of developing asthma.\n\nPromotes healthy skin and hair\n\nWinter squash blesses your skin with loads of vitamin A\u2014necessary to help regenerate skin and produce the sebum that keeps hair moisturized. Squash also delivers more than half of our recommended vitamin C, a key ingredient in collagen that provides structure and keeps your skin and hair looking young and healthy.\n\nBoosts immune function\n\nWinter squash delivers loads of vitamin C, beta-carotene, and fiber, all essential to a healthy immune system.\n\nProtects digestive health\n\nMaintaining a high fiber diet helps to prevent constipation and promote a healthy digestive tract\u2014essential for our overall health.\n\nCaution\n\nBeta-blockers, which are commonly prescribed for heart disease, can increase potassium levels in the blood. If you're taking one, eat winter squash and other high potassium foods in moderation. Talk it over with your doctor.\n\nPotassium is also a concern\u2014a serious one\u2014if your kidneys are compromised and can't remove excess potassium from the blood.\n\nPick and prepare a winter winner\n\nAs I mentioned, a winter squash's tough skin means it can be stored for months without refrigeration. Look for one that feels heavy for its size and has no soft spots. Beware any blemishes that look like punctures. They're winter squash's one vulnerability: when penetrated, they go bad quickly.\n\nThat thick skin also makes winter squash a tough nut to peel for cooking. Rather than scrape it with a sharp instrument for days, bake it first. It will then peel easily, giving you its lovely, health-giving flesh, which you can prepare in dozens of delicious ways. Fried, baked, mashed, in soup, roasted, saut\u00e9ed\u2014it's grown all over the world, so there's a world of different, mouth-watering recipes.\n\nHappy, healthy eating!", "description": "In season right now is one of the most under-appreciated .09/02/2019 3:12:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
