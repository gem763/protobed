Now he\u2019s in the vanguard of Russia\u2019s new foray onto his home continent, where he is spreading the word that working with Moscow to reduce the influence of Americans and other Westerners is in Africa\u2019s best interests.\n\n\u201cThe Russians have their own way of thinking different from the Western patterns,\u201d Matemulane said. \u201cI used to tell people: Russians are nothing else than white Africans, white blacks.\u201d\n\nRussia has been playing for power in Africa in recent years by sending arms, offering mercenaries, and cinching mining deals. More quietly, it has started to set up a low-profile infrastructure of political influence that bears echoes of the Kremlin\u2019s strategy in Europe and the United States. And it is already identifying African politicians and activists who will carry its message.\n\nDeploying its international propaganda arms, the television channel RT and the Sputnik news agency, the Kremlin is honing this message: While Western Europe and the United States are continuing a centuries-old tradition of exploiting Africa, Moscow is ready to engage with Africa on mutually beneficial terms.\n\nRussia is also benefiting from a desire by African countries to lessen their reliance on China, even as Moscow acknowledges that it cannot come close to matching Beijing\u2019s financial firepower.\n\nMatemulane runs a think tank called AFRIC, which describes itself on its website as \u201cfunded by donors with a common passion to foster Africa\u2019s development,\u201d without mentioning Russia. In an interview, though, Matemulane said the group was launched last year with support from a St. Petersburg businessman he declined to name.\n\nAFRIC received prominent billing at a summit for dozens of African leaders hosted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia at the Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, and announced it would partner with a Russian propaganda specialist who had previously focused on the United States.\n\nIt also drew the notice of Mamadou Koulibaly, a candidate for president of Ivory Coast in elections next year.\n\n\u201cI will ask them if they can introduce me to people with money who will help me,\u201d Koulibaly said of AFRIC. \u201cThis is important. A campaign needs money.\u201d\n\nMoscow has already injected itself into the geopolitics of Libya and the Central African Republic. Now it is looking for inroads in public opinion and the political elite across the continent.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, Russia\u2019s ambassador to Ghana met with Albert Kofi Owusu, the head of Ghana\u2019s main news agency, and discussed a proposal: Might Owusu distribute stories from Tass, a Russian state-controlled news service, to newspapers, websites and television stations in the West African country?\n\nOwusu said the proposal made sense, especially since his agency was already sharing Chinese state media reports. In October, Owusu was here on Russia\u2019s glittering Black Sea coast, shaking hands with Putin.\n\n\u201cVery simple man, cool,\u201d is how Owusu described Putin, who held a brief meeting at the conference with the heads of 11 African news agencies.\n\nRussian officials at the conference said that the Kremlin\u2019s RT and Sputnik would be glad to host African journalists in Moscow for training courses on topics such as social media.\n\n\u201cWe understand that getting to Moscow costs quite a bit of money, and this may well be too expensive for African newsrooms,\u201d Alexei Volin, Russia\u2019s deputy minister for communications and mass media, added after making the pitch. \u201cWe are ready to consider possibilities for RT and Sputnik specialists to organize courses on the ground in this or that African country.\u201d\n\nVolin said RT was ready to provide its suite of documentaries to African TV stations. In addition to animal movies, the library includes features like, \u201cDrift It Like Putin\u2019s Driver\u201d and \u201cCoups R Us: American Regime Changes and Their Aftermaths.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most prominent figure in Russia\u2019s Africa push is Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the St. Petersburg businessman indicted by the United States for running the online \u201ctroll farm\u201d that sought to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election, who is said to run a military contractor called Wagner that is involved in several African countries.", "description": "SOCHI, Russia -- Jose Matemulane said he left his native Mozambique nearly two decades ago, spent years studying in St. Petersburg and saw the Russian soul.
