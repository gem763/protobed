Zvimba is where the [former] president wanted to be buried. The place next to his mother is full but we managed to find another space,\u201d he said.\n\nMugabe, who came to power in 1980 and ruled Zimbabwe uninterrupted for more than 37 years, died of prostate cancer, according to President Emmerson Mnangagwa. He will be buried on Saturday night in a private ceremony which will be attended by family and close friends.\n\nRead: Robert Mugabe\u2019s tattered legacy: An educated man who refused to learn\n\nFor the last few weeks the debate has been whether he should be laid to rest at the Heroes Acre or his rural home, with the Zanu-PF preferring the latter.\n\nOn Thursday it was reported that Mnangagwa gave the go-ahead for Mugabe\u2019s body to be moved from his Harare mansion to his rural home.\n\nLeo Mugabe said the family has not allowed any external factors to meddle in its affairs: \u201cWe decided to follow his wish, as a family we do not listen to any of those, Zanu-PF, MDC or anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said the family would accept any assistance \u2013 financial and otherwise \u2013 from government for the funeral. \u201cWhat we are doing is our own programme, if they [Zimbabwean government] want to assist, they can [do so] without any conditions. If we need anything, we will let them know,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Mugabe died on September 6, several African countries have held memorial services to celebrate his contribution to Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation.\n\nLeo Mugabe has expressed his gratitude for all the organisations and governments that have honoured his uncle.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appreciate everything the EFF and the ANC did. We continue to appreciate other memorial services held throughout Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nJust days after the news of Mugabe\u2019s passing, the EFF was the first political party in South Africa to hold a memorial service to honour the fallen statesman. The service was held in Orlando, with guests including Patrick Zhuwao \u2013 a former minister and Mugabe\u2019s nephew \u2013 and former minister of local government and former rural development and national housing, Saviour Kasukuwere.\n\nZhuwao and Kasukuwere were part of the G40 faction of the late leader\u2019s administration, whose figurehead was former first lady Grace Mugabe.\n\nRead: \u2018Mugabe was tormented in his final days\u2019\n\nThey fled Zimbabwe after the military coup in 2017 and have not been permitted to attend the funeral.\n\nThe ANC held two services, both held in KwaZulu-Natal. At the first memorial, former president Thabo Mbeki delivered a keynote speech and while the other one was addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nHe will be buried on Saturday night in a private ceremony which will be attended by family and close friends.\n\nRamaphosa also spoke at a funeral service in Harare last week, where he was jeered by Zimbabweans in attendance, in reaction to the latest spate of xenophobic violence against foreign nationals in South Africa.\n\n\n\nAlso in attendance were International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor, Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Police Minister Bheki Cele and State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo.", "description": "Despite weeks of controversy and confusion regarding the burial of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, the decision was finally taken to bury him at his rural village at Kutama in Zvimba district.", "authors": ["Queenin Masuabi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9231/8cb8a6e2ae5d4e9cac7438e902c18787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
