They acted dishonestly, say the prosecution, in order to preserve the future of the bank and to preserve their own positions.\"\n\nThe men, aged between 60 and 64, deny wrongdoing.\n\nThe case hinges on what Barclays told the market in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined the fees and commissions that the bank paid to investors, including former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani.\n\nHIGH STAKES\n\nBrown alleged that Barclays swept aside established banking practices of telling the truth in public documents about the terms on which investors were backing the bank as the credit crunch roiled markets, in order to secure around four billion pounds of investment from wealthy Qatar over 2008.\n\nHe alleged that the defendants used a \"carefully contrived mechanism\" to hide the additional fees with two Advisory Service Agreements that were not genuine, but a dishonest way of paying the Qataris extra and hiding the fees from the wider world.\n\nThe men sat impassively in the narrow, raised glass-surrounded dock.\n\nThe seven-year case is a rare example of a criminal prosecution of senior bankers at a global bank over conduct during the credit crunch more than a decade ago - and a high stakes trial for the SFO.\n\nJenkins is the former chairman of investment banking in the Middle East and north Africa, Kalaris headed the bank's wealth division at the time and Richard Boath was the investment bank division's head of corporate finance in EMEA.\n\nJenkins, 64, Kalaris, 63, and 60-year-old Boath are each charged with substantive fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.\n\nThe three men each face both charges over the June capital raising, which include an allegation they conspired with former finance director Chris Lucas to make dishonest representations in public documents for profit or to expose others to loss.\n\nJenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising four months later.\n\nLucas has not been charged because he is too ill to stand trial, the jury was told. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing.", "description": "Former Barclays bankers lied about Qatari fees in 2008, fraud trial hears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF97177_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
