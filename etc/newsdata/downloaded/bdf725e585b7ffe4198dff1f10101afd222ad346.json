REUTERS/Bruno Kelly/File Photo\n\nNongovernment organization Ceres said in a statement that 230 funds have signed a declaration calling on firms to keep a close tab on supply chains, among other measures to curtail forest destruction.\n\nSignatories range from major private managers like HSBC Global Asset Management and BNP Paribas Asset Management to public pension funds like California\u2019s CalPERS, according to a list provided by Ceres, a Boston-based NGO encouraging sustainability among investors.\n\n\u201cDeforestation and loss of biodiversity are not only environmental problems. There are significant negative economic effects associated with these issues and they represent a risk that we as investors cannot ignore,\u201d said Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Storebrand Asset Management, Norway\u2019s largest private asset management firm and one of the signatories.\n\nThe resolution did not explicitly say signatories were threatening to withdraw investments from any companies. Still, it added to the pressure that international corporations and investors have put on partners operating in the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest that lies in Brazil, Bolivia and seven other countries.\n\nIn Brazil alone, more 2,400 square miles of the Amazon have been deforested this year, an area larger than the U.S. state of Delaware.\n\nMeanwhile, 60,472 fires have been recorded year-to-date in the Amazon, up 47% from last year, according to government data. Many fires have been set intentionally by farmers and ranchers, and the response of the government of Brazil\u2019s right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been criticized as indifferent.\n\nIn neighboring Bolivia, President Evo Morales has come under scrutiny for his ambitions to make the country a global food supplier, calling agricultural commodities the \u201cnew gold\u201d that will help diversify the economy.\n\nThe resolution called on companies to implement a \u201cno deforestation policy\u201d with \u201cquantifiable, time-bound commitments,\u201d assess and disclose the risks their supply chains pose to forests, establish a monitoring system for supply chain partners and report annually on \u201cdeforestation risk exposure and management.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to focus more on effective management of agricultural supply chains,\u201d Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Storebrand Asset Management, was quoted as saying in a statement released by Ceres.\n\nIn August, VF Corp (VFC.N) - owner of apparel brands such as The North Face and Vans - said it would stop purchasing leather from the Amazon in response to the fires.\n\nNorway, home to the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, has urged several of its companies to ensure they do not contribute to Amazon deforestation, including oil firm Equinor ASA (EQNR.OL), fertilizer-maker Yara International ASA (YAR.OL) and aluminum producer Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY.OL).\n\nSeparately, investors managing $15 trillion in assets turned up the heat on oil and gas sector ahead of a United Nations summit in New York aimed at accelerating efforts to fight climate change.", "description": "With widespread fires wreaking havoc on the Amazon, over 200 investors representing some $16.2 trillion under management on Wednesday called on companies to do their part in halting the destruction of the world's largest tropical rainforest.", "authors": ["Gram Slattery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431361211&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1VX", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
