Christmas Day will be spent on board while sailing between Costa Rica and Guatemala, followed by New Year\u2019s Eve in California.\n\nAfter two days in Los Angeles, the longest stretch at sea will begin: more than a week sailing across the Pacific to Atuona in French Polynesia.\n\nAfter New Zealand, Australia and Bali, Viking Sun will visit Vietnam and Cambodia before a fairly traditional journey back via India (Chennai, Cochin and Mumbai), Oman, Jordan, the Suez Canal through Egypt, Malta, Sardinia, and Malaga, before a final stop in Porto and another call in Dover.\n\nThe Italian-built ship has eight restaurants and two swimming pools.\n\nHer sister vessel, Viking Sky, experienced serious problems in a storm off the coast of Norway in March 2019. Unable to make progress or steer, the ship was hit by extreme waves, with passengers\u2019 belongings hurled around their cabin. Many passengers were evacuated by helicopter before tugs rescued the ship.", "description": "From the point where Deptford Creek in southeast London meets the River Thames, a cruise ship is starting September by setting sail on a record-breaking 33-week journey.
