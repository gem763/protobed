A poll in July showed backing for secession at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3% of people against and 44% in favor.\n\n\"There are more of us Catalan Spaniards than separatists. It's important that people see that not everyone is in favor of independence,\" said Martina Gonzalez, a 58-year-old cleaner who had a Spanish flag draped over her shoulders.\n\n\"I am Spanish, Spanish, Spanish,\" the crowd chanted.\n\nNO DIALOGUE\n\nOne of those at the rally, 54-year-old Angel Rodriguez, said he had never witnessed the sort of urban unrest that has rocked Spain's second-largest city this week.\n\n\"These young people have been indoctrinated. They can't explain why they want independence because they don\u2019t know the history,\" he said.\n\nSpain's acting Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, dismissed calls on Saturday from Catalonia's pro-independence regional chief to hold talks aimed at defusing the crisis.\n\nSanchez said Catalonia President Quim Torra must first condemn the tumult unequivocally and then build bridges with the many Catalans who do not want secession.\n\nPro-independence leaders staged an illegal referendum in 2017 and then declared they were breaking away from Spain. The Spanish government of the time immediately seized control of the Catalan administration and the ringleaders were put on trial.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday found nine politicians and activists guilty of sedition and sentenced them to up to 13 years in jail, triggering immediate street unrest.\n\nThe Catalan question has dominated domestic politics in recent years and was instrumental in triggering parliamentary elections in April, which gave no single party a majority.\n\nThe Socialists have called a national election next month, but a poll released on Thursday suggested parliament would remain split. The survey found that support for Ciudadanos was plunging, suggesting Rivera is fighting for political survival.", "description": "Anti-separatists rally in Barcelona after pro-independence unrest", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9J0CU-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
