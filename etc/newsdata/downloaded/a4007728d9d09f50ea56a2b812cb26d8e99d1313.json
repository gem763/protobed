REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe new financing will help stock Sears\u2019 store shelves for the holiday shopping season, as it struggles to become profitable. Lampert is no stranger to bankrolling Sears, having extended loans through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc to the department store chain over the last decade until its financial collapse last year.\n\nThe new financing is backed by assets that include Sears\u2019 real estate and intellectual property, the sources said. The funds are less than the roughly $200 million Sears originally sought, the sources added.\n\nSears was unable to borrow as much as it wanted because lenders were concerned about the 126-year-old company\u2019s prospects and financial wherewithal, according to the sources.\n\nAmong those that provided the financing was hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners LP, which extended a loan to the retailer while it navigated bankruptcy court last year, one of the sources said. Sears is still hoping to negotiate with lenders and secure the roughly $200 million, one of the sources said.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. A spokesman for Sears did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ESL and Cyrus declined to comment.\n\nSears filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2018 after losing billions of dollars in the face of competition from the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nLampert, formerly the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, had pledged to restore Sears to its glory days, when it owned the tallest building in the world and companies that included a radio station and Allstate insurance.\n\nSears dates back to the late 1880s and its mail-order catalogues with merchandise from toys, medicine and gramophones to automobiles, kit houses and tombstones made it the Amazon of its time.\n\nChicago\u2019s Sears Tower was the world\u2019s tallest building when it was completed in 1973, but in the following decades consumers increasingly turned to e-commerce and brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N).\n\nLampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart more than 15 years ago, heralding the formation of a retailer with $55 billion in annual sales. But revenues subsequently plunged amid the rise of online shopping and large retailers such as Walmart.\n\nSears has lost money almost every year over the past decade. Its stores deteriorated, even as Lampert bought the company\u2019s stock and lent it money. It sold several assets including its legendary Craftsman tools brand.\n\nLampert made another go at the investment during a bankruptcy auction earlier this year, purchasing about 425 Sears and Kmart stores and assuming liabilities for a collective $5.2 billion deal.\n\nThe transaction closed in February, creating a smaller Sears now operating under the moniker Transform Holdco LLC.\n\nSears is currently in the midst of closing additional stores and has warned employees and vendors of significant business challenges. It will have about 300 stores at the end of the year, the people said.\n\nThe company also plans to close its acquisition of Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores Inc, (SHOS.O) a retailer of lawn and garden equipment and appliances, as soon as next week, one of the sources said.\n\nSTORE CLOSURES\n\nSears told its employees and vendors in an August letter seen by Reuters that it has \u201cfaced a number of challenges returning our stores to sustainable levels of productivity, including... a generally weak retail environment.\u201d\n\nThe department store chain also said it could not rule out more store closures in the near term.\n\n\u201cOur goal remains to return the company to profitability and preserve as many jobs as possible in the communities we serve,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe Sears bankruptcy estate filed a lawsuit against Lampert earlier this year claiming that he had \u201clooted\u201d the company of billions of dollars, depriving creditors of repayment.\n\nAt the time it was filed, ESL said it vigorously disputed the lawsuit, calling the allegations \u201cmisleading or just flat wrong,\u201d and saying all transactions were done in good faith and for shareholders\u2019 benefit.", "description": "U.S. retailer Sears has borrowed about $150 million from lenders, including its billionaire owner Eddie Lampert, as it racks up losses less than a year after it emerged from bankruptcy protection, people familiar with the matter said.", "authors": ["Jessica Dinapoli", "Mike Spector", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442248714&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0VW-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
