Giggs wants Wales to play quick, attacking football which makes the most of their thrilling pace in the forward areas, but too often they have appeared sluggish and short of invention.\n\nThe recent victory over lowly Azerbaijan was another performance that was devoid of any clear style. Giggs acknowledged the criticism of his side\u2019s approach earlier this week, pointing out the lack of time he has to work with his players. This is a reality of international management, though, and the former Manchester United winger is now nearing his two-year anniversary in the job, winning seven of his 15 matches, so it should not be entirely unfamiliar to him. Given the number of exciting players at his disposal, plenty of Wales supporters believe there should have been more progress in performances.\n\nGetting the best out of Bale\n\nGiggs has made it clear that he does not want his side to be dependent on Gareth Bale in attack, insisting that the responsibility to score and create goals must also be shared between the promising cohort of young Wales attackers in his team. This is easier said than done, clearly, and Bale remains comfortably the most important figure in the side.\n\nWhen Bale struggles, Wales have tended to struggle too. Against Hungary in June, for example, the Real Madrid forward lacked sharpness after a difficult end to the season in Spain. He subsequently fell well short of his own usual standards, missing a crucial chance as Wales fell to a damaging 1-0 defeat.", "description": "Wales face Slovakia on Thursday night knowing that they will need to  produce a much-improved performance if they are to keep alive their  hopes of making it out of their Euro 2020 qualifying group.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Sam Wallace", "Luke Edwards"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000208968949-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6KNodvQhvkzajvf1ZyiTe0Qm-lbdt1v-Iv5_IZUYbE8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
