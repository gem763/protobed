Nathan Rousseau Smith has the story. Buzz60\n\nAfter a high school cross country team's Frontier Airlines flight was canceled due to weather, the group needed a way to get to Orlando, Florida, for the Disney Cross Country Classic over the weekend. They turned to social media and got the attention of Delta Air Lines, prompting the carrier to step in to help out.\n\nDelta spokesperson Drake Casta\u00f1eda said the airline received messages on social media from members of the team of 80 high school runners from Ocean City, New Jersey, after their Frontier flight from Philadelphia to Orlando was canceled Thursday.\n\n\"Super excited to fly down to Disney to run, but our flight got cancelled!!! @Delta can you help,\" one of the messages read.\n\nDelta worked to find a spare aircraft and reserve crew \u2013 and got the students (plus their chaperones) a private jet to Orlando. Philadelphia to Orlando isn't a route Delta routinely serves.\n\nThe flight left Philadelphia around 3 a.m. EDT Friday morning and made it to Orlando shortly after 5 a.m.\n\n\"Thank you @Delta for getting us a private charter!! We will forever be grateful for your kindness and generosity,\" the cross country team's account posted. \"Definitely a 'first class' act!!\"\n\nFrontier Airlines coordinated with Delta to arrange travel for the group after the cancellation.\n\n\"We became aware that a sports group, traveling to a competition, was affected by the cancellation and our team began looking at other options to get them to Orlando as soon as possible,\" Zach Kramer, a spokesman for Frontier, told USA TODAY. \"We found the opportunity to book the group on a new flight with another airline and assisted with helping them make new travel arrangements.\"\"\n\nDelta came to the rescue of a high school cross country team after their flight to an Orlando race was canceled, chartering a flight to get them there on time..
