Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) agreeing to help the president as the impeachment process advances. NBC News\u2019 report on the announcement highlighted what the South Carolina Republican has been up to lately.\n\nAfter retiring from Congress at the beginning of the year, Gowdy became a contributor on Fox News, where he has blasted the impeachment inquiry. [\u2026] In a sign that he\u2019d be joining Team Trump, Fox News issued a statement earlier Wednesday saying he\u2019d \u201cbeen terminated and is no longer a contributor.\u201d\n\nMedia Matters added yesterday, \u201cSince The Wall Street Journal reported on September 20 that the whistleblower complaint involved Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, leading to the inquiry announced on September 24, Gowdy has gone on Fox to slam Democrats for \u2018mishandling this investigation,\u2019 make dishonest comparisons between Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former President Barack Obama, lend credibility to a conspiracy theory pushed by the president, and single out some of Trump\u2019s favorite targets for attack.\u201d\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t fully appreciate was the degree to which Gowdy\u2019s appearances effectively served as an audition.\n\nRegardless, if the former congressman\u2019s transition from Fox News to Team Trump seems familiar, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve seen it before \u2013 many, many times.\n\nFor example, the Gowdy announcement comes just three months after the president named former Fox News contributor Monica Crowley as the new spokesperson for the Treasury Department.\n\nAs we discussed at the time, the Crowley news came just a few months after Morgan Ortagus, a former Fox News contributor, became the State Department\u2019s new spokesperson \u2013 replacing Heather Nauert, a former Fox News anchor.\n\nTwo months before that, Lea Gabrielle, a former Fox News reporter, was hired to help lead the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center.\n\nAnd circling back to our earlier coverage, each of these Fox News veterans found plenty of other folks on Team Trump who\u2019ve made the same transition. Not long after Nauert joined Team Trump, for example, the president turned to former Fox News executive Bill Shine to help oversee the White House\u2019s communications office. A few months earlier, Trump tapped Fox News\u2019 John Bolton to serve as White House national security advisor \u2013 in part because the president thought he was \u201cgood on television.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, the president chose Joe diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, to serve on his legal defense team. Both crossed the White House\u2019s radar because they were \u2013 let\u2019s all say it together \u2013 Fox News personalities. (Their role on the legal defense team was short lived.)\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told Rachel on the show a while back, \u201cI\u2019m concerned the president\u2019s world is confined now to watching Fox News\u2026 Aside from his insular existence in the Oval Office, Fox is his whole world.\u201d\n\nWell, not his whole world: Trump hired television host Larry Kudlow to be the head of the White House National Economic Council \u2013 and Kudlow worked for CNBC.\n\nHe was something of an exception, though. In addition to the aforementioned Fox veterans, Fox News\u2019 K.T. McFarland was Trump\u2019s deputy national security advisor; Fox News\u2019 Jonathan Wachtel was named the spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations; and Fox News contributors such as Ben Carson and Elaine Chao are in the president\u2019s cabinet.\n\nThe Washington Post joked during the presidential transition period, \u201cThe Trump revolution won\u2019t just be televised. It will be led by television talking heads.\u201d It\u2019s even truer now than it was then.\n\nFollowing up on an item from last year, I should emphasize that as a rule, I\u2019m not at all inclined to criticize those who watch a lot of cable news. It just so happens that I work for a cable-news television show and get paid by a cable-news network.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s also fair to say that while we\u2019ve had media-conscious presidents in American history, we\u2019re never seen someone with the kind of obsession Trump has. To get a message to the president, go on TV. To influence the direction of the White House, go on TV.\n\nAnd to get a job on Team Trump, go on TV.", "description": "If Trey Gowdy's transition from Fox News to Team Trump seems familiar, it's because we've seen it before -- many, many times.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/mp-sanders1255.jpg?itok=QH7QsvzH", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
