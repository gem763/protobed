Happ in the 11th inning after having wrestled Verlander to a draw for 6 2/3 innings, and then allowing Cole, the leading candidate for the AL Cy Young, to wiggle off the hook three times on Tuesday, it\u2019s tough to imagine the Yankees ever having a better chance to take control of this series than the two they\u2019ve already squandered.\n\n\u201cWe had him on the ropes a couple of times, but he was able to get out of it,\u2019\u2019 Gardner said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the best pitchers do.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s about all the Yankees will face the rest of the way. To borrow the catchphrase of a former Yankee manager, it\u2019s not what you want.\n\nNew York Yankees pitcher Luis Severino struggled and didn't make it out of the fifth inning in ALCS Game 3 vs. Houston. (Getty Images)\n\nBoth Boone and Astros manager A.J. Hinch had planned bullpen games for Wednesday, but the forecast looks ominous, with a 100-percent chance of rain predicted from 4 p.m. ET. If that holds, it would push the series back a day, with Games 4 and 5 at Yankee Stadium on Thursday and Friday, and Games 6 and 7, if necessary, on Saturday and Sunday in Houston. That would mean the Yankees would have to win three games in a span of four days from the team with the best regular-season record in baseball, and at least one in the home ballpark of a club that won nearly three-quarters of its home games this year.\n\nAnd, they would have to beat Verlander and/or Cole, who had the two lowest ERAs among qualifying AL starters, whose combined record was 41-11, and whose team won 50 of their 67 starts this season.\n\nImpossible, no. But likely? Hardly.\n\nAnd it all could have been different had the Yankees been able to take advantage of the comparative mortality of both of Houston\u2019s elite starters in Games 2 and 3.\n\nThe Yankees had a 2-1 lead over Verlander at the halfway point of Game 2, but Boone yanked James Paxton early and decided he could get 20 outs from his bullpen. That backfired when George Springer homered off the suddenly unreliable Adam Ottavino to tie the game in the bottom of the fifth, and exploded when Correa hit Happ\u2019s first pitch of the 11th out of the ballpark.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yankees offense managed just six hits all night, and just one after Verlander left the game with two out in the seventh.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday and the first inning against Cole. The Yankees, in a 1-0 hole courtesy of a Jose Altuve home run off Luis Severino, loaded the bases on a pair of singles and a two-out walk. But Didi Gregorius, who hit just .223 over the second half of the season and had just one hit in his first eight at-bats in this series, jumped on the first pitch and grounded out to end the inning.\n\nThat scenario played out for Gregorius and the Yankees several more times in the game. They got two runners on in the second, only to see Cole fan Aaron Judge with an unhittable slider. Two runners were on in the fourth, but D.J. LeMahieu flied out to center. And they got their hearts broken in the fifth when, with two out, Gregorius\u2019 fly ball was caught by Josh Reddick up against the right-field wall.\n\nGregorius came to bat four times and saw six pitches; three times he swung at the first thing he saw. And Cole, who had not walked more than three batters in any of his 33 starts this season, gave the Yankees five free baserunners in addition to their four hits.\n\n\u201cI mean, the pitches were right down the middle,\u2019\u2019 Gregorius said of his aggressive approach at the plate. \u201cPitches down the middle I should not miss.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWe ended up with nine baserunners against him,\u2019\u2019 Boone said of his team\u2019s near-success against Cole. \u201cYou kind of sign up for that.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the Yankees could never break through. Gregorius was not alone. Through three games, Edwin Encarnacion is batting .083, Gardner .154, Gio Urshela .182 and Gary Sanchez .077, with one hit in 13 at-bats including six strikeouts. And Giancarlo Stanton, who Boone said might be available as a pinch-hitter, stayed on the bench with a quad injury suffered in Game 1.\n\nOnly Gleyber Torres, who knocked in five of the seven runs in Game 1, provided an offensive spark. His home run off Joe Smith in the eighth accounted for the Yankees only run of the night. Overall, the Yankee bats were 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position and left 10 men on base.\n\nGleyber Torres provided the only offense once again for the Yankees on Tuesday night. (Getty Images)\n\nSeverino started off shakily \u2014 the Astros loaded the bases after Altuve\u2019s home run but failed to score, and Josh Reddick nicked him for another solo shot in the second \u2014 but settled down acceptably, allowing two runs on five hits in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nBut once again, it was the bullpen that went soft, notably Ottavino, who walked the first batter he faced, allowed a hit to the second, and was yanked, having seemingly destroyed Boone\u2019s trust and exhausted the patience of the crowd, which booed him. Zack Britton wild-pitched a run home and allowed a sacrifice fly to score another.\n\nAnd the Yankees most effective reliever, Chad Green, faced just two batters, throwing eight pitches, presumably because Boone was saving him to serve as the Game 4 opener.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been told anything yet,\u2019\u2019 Green said. \u201cBut it really doesn\u2019t matter. I get told 10 minutes before I go into a game anyway, so I\u2019ll be ready.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees, of course, hope it doesn\u2019t come to that, that the rains postpone Game 4 and allow them to go to Masahiro Tanaka on Thursday, Paxton on Friday with Severino fully rested for a possible Game 7 on Sunday.\n\nBut they know they still must beat Verlander or Cole, or maybe even both.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were going to have to beat at least one of them to advance,\u2019\u2019 Britton said, \u201cso really, nothing\u2019s changed.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd yet, everything has changed. Lost opportunities today turn into lost series\u2019 tomorrow.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "It\u2019s tough to imagine the Yankees ever having a better chance to take control of this series against the Astros than the two they\u2019ve already squandered.", "authors": ["Wallace Matthews"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pdvDUqRvh4.EmttnY67FEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDYuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eDvnywMaDEM29M89bOOdUA--~B/aD0zMjc1O3c9NDYyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/d9ecf2c0-efbe-11e9-bdfb-02165f7db4f9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
