Endometriosis is a condition where cells like the ones in the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body, such as in the ovaries or the fallopian tubes. Each month, these cells react in the same way to those in the womb, building up and then breaking down and bleeding. Unlike the cells in the womb that leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape. It\u2019s a chronic and debilitating condition that causes painful or heavy periods, and it can lead to infertility, fatigue and bowel and bladder problems. The condition is fairly common, with around 1.5 million women in the UK living with it. Symptoms vary from person to person but some of the most common include: Painful, heavy, or irregular periods\n\nPain during or after sex\n\nInfertility\n\nPainful bowel movements\n\nFatigue Endometriosis UK\n\nMORE: Bride who was told she would never have use of her legs again walks down the aisle at her wedding\n\nMORE: Woman with endometriosis is mistaken for being pregnant thanks to severe bloating\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Megan Argyle spent years suffering heavy periods and intense pain due to having endometriosis in both sets of reproductive organs.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93864308_1572423933.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
