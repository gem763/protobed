What is time? Why are bees dying at an alarming rate? Where does that highway go to? Two of these pressing questions about life (and many more) will be answered in Disney+\u2019s cute new series Forky Asks a Question, which finds our lovable Toy Story 4 spork, voiced by Tony Hale, bothering his pals with a near-constant arsenal of inquiries. He might end up being even more confused than he was before, and his pipe-cleaner arms also might fall off due to stress, but hey, at least he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s trash anymore. The ten \u201cshort films\u201d will begin streaming on November 12. And if you want a chance to see some of these shorts early, get your tickets to Vulture Festival where Tony Hale and Toy Story 4 animator Claudio de Oliveira will be screening two of them ahead of the premiere. Hooray!\n\nRelated", "description": "In the first trailer for Pixar\u2019s \u201cForky Asks a Question,\u201d Tony Hale voices the spork and asks many questions about life.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/30/30-forky.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
