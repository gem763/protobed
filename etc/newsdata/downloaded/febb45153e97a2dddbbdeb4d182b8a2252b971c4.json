It is time to reclaim our independence.\n\n\"Our job is to deliver independence. My call is that the referendum must happen next year. And we are getting ready,\" she added, to cheers from members of the SNP, Scotland's main political party.\n\nAs the law stands, to hold another referendum legally, Scotland would need the permission of the British government in Westminster.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it would be \"totally wrong\" to hold another referendum, and that to hold a vote, the UK government would need to transfer powers to Scotland's devolved parliament where Sturgeon sits.\n\nSturgeon said she would demand those powers, under Section 30 of the Scotland Act, to ensure any vote was legal.\n\n\"Before the end of this year, I will demand the transfer of power that puts the legality of a referendum beyond any doubt,\" she said.\n\nThe SNP has often expressed its sympathy for the cause of Catalan separatists. On Monday, Spain's Supreme Court jailed nine Catalan separatist leaders for their role in a failed independence bid.\n\nSturgeon said that though she understood the importance of the rule of law, \"any law that sends politicians to prison for organising a vote is a law that surely needs to change.\"\n\nShe added: \"the politicians and activists from Catalonia... are peaceful campaigners for the right to self determination just like we are.\"\n\n(Writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison)", "description": "Scotland must hold another independence referendum in 2020 and will soon request the powers needed to hold it legally, Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday.
