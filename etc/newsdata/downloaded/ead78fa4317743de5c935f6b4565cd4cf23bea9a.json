This raises the possibility of Europe remaining longer on a lower medium-term trajectory of output than earlier expected,\" it said.\n\nThe Commission said its base scenario of slower economic growth did not include an escalation of tensions in the world or a full-blown trade conflict between the United States and Europe that would include tariffs on EU cars, or Britain exiting the EU without a divorce agreement.\n\n\"The probability of such events materialising in the near-term is elevated and their impact on the European economy might be substantial,\" the Commission said.\n\nThe ministers' talks on Wednesday will be followed by discussions on how to fund a euro zone budget for investment of some 17.5 billion over seven years. France wanted this budget to be more than 10 times bigger, but the Netherlands fiercely opposed that.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BRUSSELS] The slowing euro zone economy needs pre-emptive fiscal stimulus from cash-rich countries like Germany and the Netherlands or it will face a long period of low growth, the European Commission will tell euro zone ministers next week. .
