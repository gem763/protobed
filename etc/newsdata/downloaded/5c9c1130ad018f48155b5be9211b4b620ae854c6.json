'I think about you and your loved ones everyday and I know our entire Boeing team does as well. I know that probably doesn't offer much comfort and healing at this point.'\n\nMuilenburg was hauled before Congress to discuss what happened behind-the-scenes with the problematic Boeing 737 MAX planes, which were involved in two deadly crashes - Lion Air Flight 610 on October 28, 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flights 302, which occurred March 10, 2019, which together killed 346.\n\nNow the whole fleet is grounded, impacting U.S.-based airlines, American and Southwest.\n\n'Every day that drives us to improve our safety of our airplanes and our industry,' Muilenburg said of the crashes.\n\n'We will never forget,' he said. 'And that is our commitment going forward.'\n\nAsked ahead of the hearing if he would resign, Muilenburg said that was 'not where my focus is.'\n\nHe also declined to say if he or the board were considering his resignation after the plane returns to service.\n\nBoeing ran full-page advertisements in major newspapers expressing condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in the crashes on Tuesday.\n\n'These two accidents occurred on my watch and I have a keen sense of responsibility,' Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, told reporters.\n\nFamily members, holding photos of victims of the crash, were seated just three rows behind Muilenburg during his testimony.\n\nDuring Sen. Richard Blumenthal's turn to ask questions, he asked the family members to stand and hold up those photos, before tearing into Muilenburg.\n\n'As I watch those loved ones stand ... and as I sit here today, my anger has only grown,' the Connecticut Democrat said. 'These loved ones lost lives because of an accident that was not only preventable as the chairman said at the very start, but was part of a pattern of deliberate concealment.\n\nBlumenthal reminded the crowd that Boeing had originally blamed the crashes on 'pilot error.'\n\n'Those pilots never had a chance,' he said. 'These loved ones never had a chance.'\n\n'They were in flying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding that it was going to conceal MCAS from the pilots,' he added.\n\nInvestigators have linked MCAS, a flight control system, to both crashes.\n\nMuilenburg admitted to knowing about messages written by a test pilot, warning of 'egregious' problems with the system before the second plane crash, but said Tuesday he didn't know the contents of those messages at the time.\n\nMuilenburg also clarified that his company wasn't placing blame on the pilots.\n\n'We have not blamed the pilots, and I know that\u2019s been reported, but that it not our company position and it never will be,' the CEO said. 'We are responsible for our airplanes. We are responsible, and we own that, regardless of cause.'\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely not acknowledged blame and, instead, vowed to make a 'safe plane safer.'\n\nSen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, didn't buy that the planes were safe.\n\n'I would walk before I was to get on a 737 MAX, I would walk,' Tester said. 'There's no way.'\n\n'And the question becomes when issues like this happen it costs your company huge,' Tester added. 'So you shouldn't be cutting corners and I see corners being cut and this committee's going to have to do something to stop that from happening.'\n\nTuesday's hearing represents Boeing's broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes, though Muilenburg's written testimony ahead of the hearing did not describe in detail what those mistakes were.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the committee chairman, addressed families of the crash victims: 'I promise to their loved ones that we will find out what went wrong and work to prevent future tragedies.'\n\nOn Monday, Muilenburg visited the Indonesian Embassy in Washington to meet with the ambassador and 'pay our respects to those lost aboard Lion Air flight 610 on the first anniversary of the accident,' Boeing said in a statement.\n\nMuilenburg will also testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.\n\nMichael Stumo, the father of Samya Rose Stumo, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in March, said on Monday the victims' families would hold up photos of the 'loved ones we lost' to 'make sure the focus is on that, rather than political or bureaucratic or engineering issues.'\n\nHe questioned why Boeing was only now adding safeguards to MCAS.\n\n'When you knew the MCAS system was part of that Lion Air crash, why didn't you act to correct it immediately instead of still withholding information about it and blaming the pilots?' Stumo said of Boeing.\n\nU.S. airlines have canceled flights into January and February because of the grounding, and the Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the 737 MAX's ungrounding until December at the earliest.\n\nIn March, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane was grounded worldwide.\n\nIndonesian investigators reported on Friday that Boeing, acting without adequate oversight from U.S. regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for the Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air 610 crash, which also involved errors by airline workers and crew.\n\nAt the hearing, Blumenthal said he was disappointed by the FAA as well. He said the FAA had given him overly redacted documents and refused to return his calls.\n\nMuilenburg added that 'regulators should approve the return of the MAX to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane's safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.'", "description": "Boeing CEO\u00a0Dennis Muilenburg opened up his Senate testimony Tuesday with an apology.", "authors": ["Nikki Schwab", "Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20333280-0-image-a-92_1572364123537.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
