New Zealand native Michael Pratt had been due to testify in an ongoing class-action lawsuit in which 22 unnamed women accused him, his company, and several associates of an elaborate racket to coerce young girls into shooting porn under the guise of anonymity. For months, Pratt and his colleagues denied wrongdoing. Then, Pratt ignored his subpoena to testify in court and disappeared across the border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like catching the murderer at the border with a beard and dyed hair,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Brian Holm, said in court. \u201cIt would be relevant to the consciousness of guilt if you are talking about leaving the country you have lived in for 12 years because of a civil lawsuit.\u201d\n\nIn all likelihood, Pratt will not testify in the trial, which is scheduled to end later this month. But his former administrative assistant, Valerie Moser, provided testimony in transcripts obtained by The Daily Beast that shed light on what working for him was like. Over the course of two days, Moser detailed what she had seen during three and a half years at the company, painting a grim portrait of Pratt, whom she described as an irritable, paranoid guy, prone to \u201cman tantrums,\u201d who often \u201csmashed phones and keyboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen Michael Pratt attack an employee. [Another colleague] has shown me scars where Michael Pratt stabbed him,\u201d Moser said in court transcripts. \u201cI have seen him at his drunkest. I have seen the worst parts of him. I know what he\u2019s capable of. I think I understand the way his mind works and that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nThe 22 Jane Does claim Pratt conned them by promising that their videos would remain anonymous, that they would be distributed only to private buyers in Australia and elsewhere abroad, and that they would earn thousands of dollars, which rarely materialized. For less willing candidates, Pratt allegedly paid women to pose as references and promise the prospective models that everything would turn out fine.\n\nMoser began working for Pratt in March of 2015, when she answered an advertisement on Craigslist. She told the court she was hired for her organizational and meticulous note-taking skills\u2014traits she illustrated at trial with stringent accounting from her years at the company. Her role primarily involved organization tasks: overseeing modeling contracts, receipts, expenses, and keeping the company in steady supply of prepaid credit cards, as standard credit cards can get banned by Craigslist if flagged for pornography. She also alleged she was responsible for picking the models up from the airport, getting them in makeup\u2014or \u201chosing them off,\u201d as Pratt called it\u2014and dropping them off at hotels for shoots. If asked about her role, Moser remembered, Pratt told her to say: \u201cI\u2019m just an Uber driver.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Moser\u2019s duties, she claimed, was taking something Pratt called \u201cPanda Pics.\u201d These were nude photos Moser would take of each model after she arrived, so-called because of the location they were taken: in front of a portrait of a panda holding two guns in one of the defendants\u2019 apartments. Although Pratt typically promised the models a specific rate before flying them to San Diego, Moser said rates were usually determined by how good the girls looked by the panda.\n\n\u201c Moser testified in court that on this call, she overheard Pratt make many of the claims the plaintiff\u2019s allege they were told: that the footage would be sent on DVD and mailed to Australia; that it would be sold in an adult film store; that the identity of the model would remain private; that the sex \u2018would involve nothing weird.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen she was first brought on, Moser never learned the name of the company, Girls Do Porn. Instead, she called the company \u201cBLL Media,\u201d one of several alternate names for Pratt\u2019s businesses. The BLL stood for \u201cBMW, Lamborghini, Land Rover,\u201d because Pratt reportedly had one of each. But sometime into her employment, Moser overheard Pratt use the real name in conversation. He then instructed her not to mention the name \u201cGirls Do Porn.\u201d If asked, she was to call it \u201cPlus One Media,\u201d a name which turned up a tamer website. As part of her hiring, Moser had signed a non-disclosure agreement. Pratt allegedly indicated that if she told models the real name of the company, Moser would violate the agreement.\n\nNot long later, the assistant said she overheard another conversation, this time when Pratt was talking to a potential model. Moser testified in court that on this call, she overheard Pratt make many of the claims the plaintiff\u2019s allege they were told: that the footage would be sent on DVD and mailed to Australia; that it would be sold in an adult film store; that the identity of the model would remain private; that the sex \u201cwould involve nothing weird.\u201d At the time, Moser thought all this was true.\n\nBut she later learned that none of those claims were honest. Pratt allegedly had her create a Google Hangouts number to correspond with candidates and thereby \u201cavoid getting harassed by the models\u201d on her real phone. There, at least a dozen young women messaged her with complaints about their videos, which were uploaded directly online and often viewed hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of times. Girls begged Moser to remove their videos, offering to return their earnings or pay extra. For the first year at Girls Do Porn, Moser would forward these messages to Pratt. He often told her to block their numbers. She did.\n\nThen, in August of 2016, Girls Do Porn got served with the class-action lawsuit. According to Moser, the complaints from models never stopped, but the way the company handled them did. Instead of sending messages to Pratt, Moser said, she forwarded them to the company\u2019s lawyer, who knew the company by yet another different name than Girls Do Porn. When the girls would call that lawyer, Moser said, he often had no idea what they were talking about. \u201cThey were sent in circles,\u201d she told the court.\n\nAfter the lawsuit began in earnest, Moser said, Pratt asked her to delete every message she had with models. He asked her to destroy any hotel receipts indicating that alcohol was purchased, as some of the women claimed they were intoxicated upon signing their contracts. He talked about selling his car or home to avoid having them accounted for in the lawsuit. Another employee and a co-defendant in the case, Matthew Wolfe, asked Moser to shred documents that showed him wiring company money to accounts in New Zealand. According to Moser, Pratt told her: \u201cDisclosure of company secrets would result in a lawsuit.\u201d\n\nMoser said complied with most of their demands. But at the same time, she started what the court documents refer to as her \u201cCYA Journal,\u201d short for \u201cCover Your Ass.\u201d In it, she took notes from conversations with Pratt, inventoried and dated every conversation she had with a model, and took notes on her treatment at work.\n\nWhen Pratt found out about the journal, he was furious. One day, just a few weeks before she was fired, Moser said she came into work to find her desk trashed\u2014furniture knocked over, papers ripped, supplies in disarray. Moser said she saw one of her colleagues following her home on two separate occasions.\n\nNot long later, Moser was told to start working remotely. She had a \u201cbad attitude,\u201d the company said. By the fall of 2018, Moser received an email from Pratt\u2019s lawyer, terminating her employment. He offered severance, but only if she signed an NDA. She declined.\n\nJust before her firing, Moser had a text conversation with Pratt about the lawsuit, which was read during trial. In an exchange from September, he told her the plaintiffs thought he had money in off-shore accounts (her response: \u201cmost smart businessmen do.\u201d) He complained that \u201canything is better than being in this lawsuit, LOL,\u201d and insisted that both the plaintiffs and their lawyer would \u201cget nothing.\u201d For her part, Moser seemed sad about losing her job. \u201cI promised myself I will get another Corvette one day,\u201d she wrote, \u201cone day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have plenty of time,\u201d Pratt told her. \u201cI just want to get mine in case I have to leave the United States. Haha.\u201d", "description": "The former administrative assistant at a company accused of scamming girls into porn brought her \u201cCover Your Ass Journal\u201d to court.
