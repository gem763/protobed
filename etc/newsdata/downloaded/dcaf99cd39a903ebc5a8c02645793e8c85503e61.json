(AP) - Mason Crosby nailed a 23-yard field goal as time expired, and the Green Bay Packers benefited from some questionable officiating to rally past the Detroit Lions 23-22 on Monday night.\n\nAaron Rodgers, in his second straight game without top target Davante Adams, completed 24 of 39 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns, including a beautiful 35-yard throw to Allen Lazard for the second-year pro\u2019s first career score.\n\nRodgers linked up with Jamaal Williams for the other TD. Williams finished with 104 yards on 14 carries and four catches for 32 yards for Green Bay (5-1), which captured its first win in five tries against its NFC North rival.\n\nThe Packers might not have pulled it off if not for two fourth-quarter penalties for illegal hands to the face against Detroit\u2019s Trey Flowers, both of them on third down. The first set up Lazard\u2019s touchdown, and the second allowed Green Bay to run the clock down to 2 seconds before Crosby\u2019s game-winner. In both cases, replays showed Flowers\u2019 hands on the neck or shoulder - not the face - of a Packers lineman.\n\nMatt Prater was good from 26, 22, 41, 51 and 54 yards for the Lions (2-2-1).\n\nMatthew Stafford finished 18 of 32 for 265 yards and was sacked three times.\n\nKerryon Johnson scored the lone touchdown for the Lions from 1 yard out in the first quarter.\n\nKenny Golladay had 121 yards on five catches for Detroit.\n\nPreston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith each had a sack for Green Bay. Preston Smith and Kyler Fackrell combined for the other.\n\nRodgers was sacked once by Damon Harrison Sr. and threw an interception that bounced off the facemask of an open Derrius Shepherd near the goal line. James Coleman snagged the ball returned it 55 yards, setting up Prater\u2019s last field goal that made it 22-13.\n\n3,000 YARDS AND RUNNING\n\nRodgers surpassed 3,000 career rushing yards on a 12-yard run in the fourth quarter. He\u2019s the 13th Packers player reach the milestone.\n\nINJURIES\n\nPackers: WR Marquez Valdes-Scantling had his right leg bend under him on a tackle in the second quarter. He was able to walk off under his own power. WR Geronimo Allison was carted off the field following a helmet-to-helmet hit by Tracy Walker on the first play of the third quarter. He did not return. Allison was being evaluated for a chest injury and a concussion.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLions: Host the Minnesota Vikings on Oct. 20.\n\nPackers: Host the Oakland Raiders on Oct. 20.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mason Crosby nailed a 23-yard field goal as time expired, and the Green Bay Packers benefited from some questionable officiating to rally past the Detroit Lions 23-22 on Monday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/lions_packers_football_13134_c0-116-2773-1733_s1200x700.jpg?a814c4ba77a67c02f65ee8c0411729a97522b9fe", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
