They were stories of vital importance to the Australian people,\" Dr Collins told the court.\n\nOn Monday, ABC lawyer Michael Rippon said the AFP told the broadcaster it did not want \u201cany sensationalist headlines\u201d about the raids.\n\nHe also said that during the raid, it was \u201cmade clear\u201d to the ABC\u2019s legal staff that a public interest defence afforded to journalists under the criminal code was \u201conly a defence\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t stop them from investigating matters\u201d.\n\nMr Rippon was one of the ABC staff who supervised the raid.\n\nTuesday's court date was the second day of a full court hearing into the validity of the warrant. Justice Abraham adjourned the hearing early \u2013 it was originally slated to take three days \u2013 and will deliver her judgment at a later date.\n\nThe AFP previously agreed not to access the documents it seized in the raid, which are being held on USB sticks, and on Tuesday gave an undertaking to continue this commitment until a week after the judgment.\n\nMr Williams warned, however, that the undertaking may not be extended should the ABC appeal Justice Abraham\u2019s decision if they lose the case.", "description": "Upholding the Australian Federal Police's warrant to raid the ABC's Ultimo offices may scare people away from reporting wrongdoing to journalists, a leading media barrister has warned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2943%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_375%2C$y_260/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1d1ff6f710f2060b7726aad684364bca8e8a8ae7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
