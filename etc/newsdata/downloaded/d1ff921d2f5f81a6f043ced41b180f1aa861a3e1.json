This is a dangerous time.\u201d\n\nNYT UPDATES KAVANAUGH 'BOMBSHELL' TO NOTE ACCUSER DOESN'T RECALL ALLEGED ASSAULT\n\nThe comments came after top 2020 Democratic contenders Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Julian Castro announced on Sunday that Kavanaugh \"must be impeached,\" after an uncorroborated and disputed allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh resurfaced in the weekend New York Times piece.\n\nThe New York Times revised its story to include the fact that several friends of the alleged victim said she told them she did not recall the supposed sexual assault in question.\n\nThe major revision to the Times' reporting came several hours after various politicians, including virtually all major 2020 Democratic candidates for president, cited the Times' reporting as a reason to impeach Kavanaugh.\n\nKAVANAUGH 'MUST BE IMPEACHED,' TOP DEMS SAY, AS UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATION RESURFACES\n\nThe Times piece by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, adapted from their forthcoming book, asserted that a Kavanaugh classmate, Clinton-connected nonprofit CEO Max Stier, \"saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\"\n\nThe revitalized, longshot push to get Kavanaugh removed from the high court comes as Democrats' apparent effort to impeach President Trump has largely stalled. Trump, for his part, suggested Sunday that Kavanaugh should sue for defamation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBennett went on to say, \u201cWhat happens in an age in which we believe the only thing that matters is my truth, there is no such thing as objective truth. What prevents three or four women who are totally opposed to Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh saying \u2018yep, I was there and I saw it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News contributor Dr. Bill Bennett said on Wednesday that our current state of politics is \u201ca dangerous time,\u201d reacting to President Trump calling for New York Times employees to resign for its attack on Brett Kavanaugh.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-18-at-12.56.29-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
