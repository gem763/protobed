But then the only player on the pitch who was younger than the 17-year-old United striker decided to muscle in on the action and write a fairytale all of his own.\n\nWhatever becomes of Luke Matheson, the Rochdale winger will always remember the moment when, aged just 16 years and 357 days, he silenced Old Trafford with a volley that he is likely to be watching on repeat for weeks to come.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt was enough to take the game to penalties. A memorable night threatened to become a magical one for the League One outfit, and a complete humiliation for this deeply flawed United side, but Jimmy Keohane\u2019s miss helped the home side to sneak into the fourth round with a 5-3 victory on penalties.\n\nInterestingly, Paul Pogba - who had missed from the spot against Wolverhampton Wanderers - was not among United\u2019s penalty takers and it was left to Daniel James to score the decisive kick and spare Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a long and painful inquest.\n\nWatching United these days is like pushing food around a plate. They have played Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester, Astana and now Rochdale at Old Trafford this season and have failed to score from open play in the first half of every one of those games.\n\nMason Greenwood scored his second goal at Old Trafford inside a week Credit: AFP\n\nStory continues\n\nThey would have happily settled for a deflected effort from a contentious corner here mind, anything in fact to break the deadlock and stop this from feeling like a re-run of that trying Astana game. Manchester City\u2019s Under-21 side beat this Rochdale team a fortnight ago. Peterborough stuck six past them. But United departed for the interval goalless. Surely the second half would offer so much more? The shot count read 15-0 in United\u2019s favour at half-time but it flattered the home team.\n\nThe majority of those shots were speculative efforts from distance, several from the wayward boots of Paul Pogba, back in the starting line-up after three weeks out with a twisted ankle. The Frenchman should have put United in front after 34 minutes following the one moment of genuine class on show, Mason Greenwood darting inside and clipping a lovely inswinging cross into Pogba who headed narrowly over. It was a golden chance, one Pogba should have taken.\n\nEqually, it is fair to wonder if United have another midfielder capable of making that sort of penetrative run into the penalty area? Rochdale were honest and industrious and ready to pounce on any United sloppiness, of which there was plenty. Fred kept giving the ball away, the workmanlike Andreas Pereira looked like a square peg in a round hole on the right wing. Phil Jones was substituted at the break injured. It all sounds wearily familiar, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nJimmy Keohane missed the crucial penalty Credit: Reuterts\n\nMarcos Rojo had a diving header saved after one good United counter and Jesse Lingard glanced a header just over from a cross by Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Greenwood was also denied by Robert Sanchez as he bore down on the Rochdale goalkeeper.\n\nAnd then calamity almost struck for United early in the 53rd minute. Rochdale attacked and Luke Matheson - isolated on the right wing for much of the opening period - crossed low into United\u2019s penalty area. Oliver Rathbone, a former United youth team player, picked up the ball and displayed both a cool head and excellent close control to weave in and out of three United bodies in a tight space, first Rojo, then Fred and finally Axel Tuanzebe, before calmly pulling the ball back for Callum Camps.\n\nIt was the Rochdale midfielder\u2019s chance to put his name up in lights. The goal gaped and 7,000 Rochdale fans held their breath. Either side of Wan-Bissaka and Brian Barry-Murphy\u2019s side would have been ahead but Camps steered the ball close enough for the United right back to produce an acrobatic clearance and spare his relieved team-mates. It was brilliant from Wan-Bissaka but Camps should have scored.\n\nFor a short time, it looked like Greenwood had again rode to United\u2019s rescue. Greenwood was thwarted by a good save shortly after the hour mark from a pass by Daniel James, who had replaced the ineffectual Tahith Chong, but he would not be denied for much longer. Pereira found Lingard in the D who in turn fed Greenwood, lurking in the penalty area. It was a similar position to where he had picked up the ball against Astana but rather than cut on to his right like then, Greenwood darted inside Rhys Norrington-Davies, creating just enough space to drill a left-foot shot into the bottom corner.\n\nJob done? Rochdale had other ideas, not least the only player on the pitch who was younger than Greenwood. There did not seem to be too much on when Jimmy McNulty floated a long pass forward from the right touchline deep in United\u2019s half but the ball sailed over the head of Wan-Bissaka and into the path of the lively Rathbone. His cross was perfect and there was Matheson to stroke home on the volley. This really was the stuff of dreams for the teenager.", "description": "For a brief while, this looked like being the second rescue act in less than a week from Manchester United\u2019s teenage prodigy, Mason Greenwood.
