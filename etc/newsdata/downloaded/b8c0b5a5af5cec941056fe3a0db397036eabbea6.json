What initially were massive but peaceful marches and sit-ins have intensified into battles between hardcore demonstrators hurling firebombs and bricks at police who have deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. Both sides blame the other for using increasingly aggressive tactics.\n\nSamson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University, said the main factor drawing people into the protests has been anger over alleged police brutality.\n\nYuen said the decision to disqualify Wong from running in a local election was a \u201cstrange decision\u201d also likely to add to public \u201canger or grievances.\u201d\n\nWong, 23, became known as the young face of Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cUmbrella Movement\u201d that peacefully occupied streets for 79 days in 2014. He since has been repeatedly arrested and jailed.\n\nHe has played a smaller role in the current protests, whose leadership is more diffuse, but China\u2019s communist leaders have targeted him in accusing foreign powers of colluding with anti-China separatists to foment unrest.\n\nWong posted on his Twitter account a copy of a letter ruling invalid his nomination as a candidate in the Nov. 24 local district council elections. The government confirmed Wong\u2019s disqualification, without identifying him.\n\n\u201cThe decision to ban me from running for office is clearly politically driven,\u201d Wong told reporters. He said Beijing was pressuring Hong Kong election officials to carry out political censorship but it would backfire.\n\n\u201cIt will just trigger more and more Hong Kongers to take to the street and also vote in the election.\u201d\n\nThe letter said Wong\u2019s embrace of the concept of self-determination includes Hong Kong\u2019s independence, which violates a requirement to promise to uphold its constitution. Wong denied that, saying his answers to the officer\u2019s questions were twisted as part of a \u201cmind reading game.\u201d\n\nWong and other pro-democracy activists were disqualified from running in previous elections. This time, Wong said he alone was banned among more than 1,000 candidates.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s neighborhood councilors and half of Hong Kong\u2019s legislature are directly elected, but the rest are chosen by trade and industry groups while the top leader is handpicked by an elite pro-Beijing panel.\n\nThe protesters are seeking full democracy and want that to change.\n\nThe current round of demonstrations was sparked by concern over proposed extradition legislation that could have led to Hong Kong citizens facing trials in mainland Chinese courts, where they would not enjoy the same sorts of civil protections granted to their own region when Britain handed control of the former colony to China in 1997.\n\nIt reflects deep unease over an erosion of such rights and liberties, which are denied to people living under communist rule in the Chinese mainland.\n\nThe extradition legislation was eventually formally withdrawn, but the authorities have rejected calls for Lam to resign and for an independent inquiry into the handling of the protests by the police. Meanwhile, the protesters have widened their demands, seeking greater democracy.\n\nWith no end to the standoff in sight, Lam said the city is at risk of falling into a recession as its tourism and retail industries languish.\n\n\u201cIf this quarter\u2019s growth rate, compared to the second quarter\u2019s growth rate, is negative, it will be the second decline in a row.\n\nThen it can be said that we have entered a technical recession,\u201d she said.\n\nThe economy could end up contracting for the full year, she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hong Kong authorities barred pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong from an election as the city's leader warned Tuesday that months of violent protests have pushed the city to the brink of recession.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kelvin Chan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/29/Hong_Kong_Protests_89527.jpg-7316b_c0-195-3500-2236_s1200x700.jpg?264c7fbef378cacdde13c86f54de0b0e08fb3183", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
