On Thursday, China said Beijing and Washington agreed to hold high-level trade talks in early October.\n\n\u201cThe upswing itself is likely to have sparked further follow-up buying,\u201d said Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank, who added the planned U.S.-China trade talks were among factors boosting investor risk appetite.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude was up 17 cents at $60.87 a barrel by 0945 GMT, having earlier fallen to $60.25. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 1 cent to $56.27.\n\nStill, the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, on Wednesday said U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 400,000 barrels last week, whereas analysts had expected a fall. The government\u2019s official supply report is due later on Thursday. [EA/S]\n\n\u201cOil prices remain range-bound despite yesterday\u2019s rally,\u201d said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. \u201cAPI reported a modest increase in inventories on Wednesday, which failed to do much for oil prices.\u201d\n\nThe prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute has been a dampener on oil prices but Brent is still up 12% this year, helped by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia.\n\nNonetheless, both OPEC and Russia boosted production in August, according to a Reuters survey and Russian energy ministry figures, weighing on prices.\n\nAlso putting downward pressure on prices has been mounting evidence of slowing economic growth worldwide, which has prompted analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand growth.\n\nBP (BP.L) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters on Wednesday that global oil demand was expected to grow by less than 1 million barrels per day in 2019, a slowdown from previous years.\n\nLater on Thursday, attention will focus on U.S. government weekly inventory figures from the Energy Information Administration to see if they confirm API\u2019s view on inventory changes. The EIA report is due out at 1500 GMT.\n\nAnalysts expect crude stocks fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to Aug. 30.", "description": "Oil edged further above $60 a barrel on Thursday as hopes of progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade row boosted investor sentiment, although a report showing U.S. crude inventories rose unexpectedly weighed on prices.", "authors": ["Alex Lawler", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426350109&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF84027", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
