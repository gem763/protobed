O'Brien. | Michael Campanella/Getty Images White House Trump's new national security adviser is the anti-Bolton in style only Robert O\u2019Brien might be just as hawkish as John Bolton, but he is \"certainly not as pugilistic,\" according to people close to the president's new adviser.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will appoint U.S. hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien to replace John Bolton as his national security adviser, after a \u201chard\" lobbying campaign from the increasingly empowered secretary of State, Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cI have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nO\u2019Brien represents a stylistic \u2014 but not necessarily an ideological \u2014 shift from the man he is replacing. People who have worked with and are close to O\u2019Brien describe him as similarly aggressive as his predecessor on issues like Iran, but more of a congenial colleague than Bolton, who was known as a sharp bureaucratic infighter. And unlike Bolton, O\u2019Brien, a career lawyer before working in government, is not a big name in the intelligence and national security world, indicating he will likely bring a much lower profile to the job.\n\n\u201cHe worked for John Bolton at the United Nations and might be as hawkish,\u201d said Andrew Exum, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policy from 2015-2016 who knows O\u2019Brien and has traveled with him. \u201cBut he\u2019s certainly not as pugilistic.\u201d\n\nAnother person close to O\u2019Brien agreed that he is \u201cdefinitely in the same school as Bolton on Iran,\u201d describing him as \u201chawkish\u201d but \u201cmore of a team player\u201d \u2014 and more compliant with Trump and Pompeo\u2019s demands. \u201cRobert\u2019s not going to push back too much,\u201d this person said.\n\nAs the U.S. hostage negotiator, O\u2019Brien got on the president\u2019s radar via a very Trumpian combination \u2014 flattering comments and his involvement in an only-in-the-Trump era attempt to free an American rapper detained in Sweden.\n\nWhen A$AP Rocky was jailed on assault charges, Trump made a show of dispatching O\u2019Brien to Sweden to assist in the case, far different than the normal situations he dealt with in hostile countries and war-torn regions.\n\nTrump tweeted frequently about the case from Washington, and claimed that O\u2019Brien had called him \u201cthe greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States.\u201d The State Department later confirmed to The New York Times that O\u2019Brien had indeed described him that way. Rocky was eventually released to the U.S.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

We've had tremendous success in that regard, brought home many people,\" Trump told reporters. \"And through hostage negotiation, I got to know him very well myself. But also a lot of people that I respect rated him as the absolute number one choice.\"\n\nStanding next to Trump, O'Brien returned the praise.\n\n\"We've got a number of challenges but there's a great team in place,\" he said. \"I look forward to working with them, and the president, to keep America safe and continue to rebuild our military and really get us back to a peace through strength posture.\"\n\nO\u2019Brien isn\u2019t a big name in national security circles. Fred Fleitz, Bolton\u2019s former chief of staff who was also considered for the post, said he knows next to nothing about O\u2019Brien except that he \u201cseems to have pretty good credentials on paper.\u201d Asked whether the Senate Intelligence Committee knew anything about O\u2019Brien, a committee aide said, \u201cnope, not really.\u201d\n\nBut Pompeo, who has known O\u2019Brien \u201cfor a long time,\u201d urged Trump to appoint the hostage envoy, according to a senior administration official.\n\n\u201cObviously Secretary Pompeo had a big say in who it would be,\u201d agreed a senior White House official.\n\nO\u2019Brien did pop up during 2016 elections as a foreign policy adviser to Trump opponents Scott Walker and Ted Cruz, four years after he had advised Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign on the same issues. In 2015, while he was still in the Cruz camp, O\u2019Brien wrote that the Texas senator had an \u201copening\u201d to differentiate himself on national security from Trump, \u201cwho has been playing up how chummy he will be with Vladimir Putin if he is elected.\u201d\n\nPrior to joining the Trump administration, O\u2019Brien served as co-chairman of the State Department's public-private partnership for justice reform in Afghanistan under both President Barack Obama and George W. Bush. He also served as a U.S. Representative to the U.N. General Assembly in 2005, where he worked alongside Bolton.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Wednesday, Trump praised O\u2019Brien as \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nThe former hostage envoy comes aboard as Trump faces a number of crises in the Middle East, including attempts to broker peace in Afghanistan with the Taliban as well as between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe administration is also grappling with how to confront an increasingly hostile Iranian regime, which Trump hit with a fresh package of sanctions just moments before revealing that he'd tapped O'Brien for the national security post.\n\nTrump has also thrown out the possibility of a third nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un prior to next year\u2019s election, in addition to the prospect of reaching a new arms deal with Russia and the ongoing push to beat back the Islamic State \u2014 all of which will require O\u2019Brien\u2019s involvement.\n\nO\u2019Brien, who has advocated for expanding the Navy and was reportedly considered in 2017 to serve as Trump\u2019s Navy secretary, beat out Fleitz, a former CIA analyst who served as Bolton\u2019s chief of staff; Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; Keith Kellogg, national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence; and Ricky Waddell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump.\n\nEarly on in the search, the president ruled out appointing Pompeo to take over the post in addition to his duties at the State Department, though White House counselor Kellyanne Conway signaled he would play a large role assisting Trump with selecting the administration\u2019s fourth national security adviser.\n\nLast week, Trump downplayed the record levels of turnover in his administration, asserting that a job in his White House was a hot commodity.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants it badly, as you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people want the job \u2014 it\u2019s a great job. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s a lot of fun to work with Donald Trump. It\u2019s very easy actually to work with me. You know why it\u2019s easy? Because I make all the decisions. They don\u2019t have to work.\u201d", "description": "Robert O\u2019Brien might be just as hawkish as John Bolton, but he is \"certainly not as pugilistic,\" according to people close to the president's new adviser.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand", "Daniel Lippman", "Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ee/4a/3935ea554091be70e71208ab8bca/190918-robert-obrien-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
