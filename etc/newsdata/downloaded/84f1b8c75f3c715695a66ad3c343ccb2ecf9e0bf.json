Global companies such as Vans, fearing a consumer backlash from mainland customers if found to be political, are walking a tightrope in their marketing campaigns.\n\nThe Vans Global Custom Culture competition this year had received submissions from over 100,000 artists and creators from around the globe, and the shoe-maker invited the public to cast their votes for most popular designs eight days ago.\n\nMedia reports said a design from a Canada-based user named Naomiso was the most popular, according to votes cast online, before it was taken down on Saturday.\n\nIt featured a red bauhinia, the flower on Hong Kong's flag, and a yellow umbrella, a nod to the 2014 protests that some refer to as the umbrella revolution. A group of people wearing helmets, masks and goggles can be seen on the side of the sneaker design.\n\nA search of the username Naomiso on the Custom Culture's website did not yield any result on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have never taken a political position and therefore review designs to ensure they are in line with our company's long-held values of respect and tolerance, as well as with our clearly communicated guidelines for this competition,\" Vans said in a Facebook statement on Saturday.\n\n\"Based on the global competitions guidelines, Vans can confirm that a small number of artistic submissions have been removed. This decision was taken to uphold the purpose of Custom Culture,\" said Vans, a unit of VF Corp.\n\nWinners will win $25,000 and have their designs manufactured and sold by the brand.\n\nVans did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday.
