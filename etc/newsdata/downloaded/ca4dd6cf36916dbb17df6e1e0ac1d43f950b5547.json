Typically, interest-rate cuts drive currencies lower, but as we saw with last week\u2019s European Central-Bank meeting when the bottomed after aggressive monetary easing, it's rarely that simple. Expectations are one of the main reasons why investors are buying USD/JPY ahead of the central-bank meeting. The market has completely discounted a quarter point cut but Chairman Jay Powell may not commit to much more beyond that.\n\nThe US economy has seen improvements and deterioration since the July meeting. slowed, moderated, eased and soured.

The Fed may cut rates in September but even if they lower interest rates, the accompanying could be less dovish.\n\nIf Powell laces the rate cut with optimism, the biggest beneficiary should be , which will make a break of 109. could also u-turn for a trip back below 1.10.
