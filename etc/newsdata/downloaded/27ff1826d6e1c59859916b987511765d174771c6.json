BASF weighs $4 bln Indian chemicals complex with partners\n\nFRANKFURT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - German chemicals maker BASF is teaming up with partners to study the feasibility of a petrochemical complex in India worth up to $4 billion, which would be the world's first to be fully powered by renewable energy.\n\nBASF said on Thursday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Adani (NS: ) Group and Borealis AG to further evaluate a collaboration to build the chemical site in Mundra, in India's Gujarat state.\n\nBASF would foot roughly half of the overall investment bill, a spokesman added.\n\nUnder the plan, the partners would build a plant to produce propylene from propane gas to be supplied by ADNOC.\n\nSome of the propylene would go into a complex to produce polypropylene plastic, to be owned by ADNOC and Borealis, with the rest of the propylene to be used by a joint venture between BASF and Adani to make intermediate chemical products.", "description": "BASF weighs $4 bln Indian chemicals complex with partners", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB230DM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
