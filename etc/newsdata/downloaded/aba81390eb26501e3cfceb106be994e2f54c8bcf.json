Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Says he could destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if #Syria is not resolved in a humane way.

You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will. I\u2019ve already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson.\n\nI have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don\u2019t let the world down. You can make a great deal. General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past. I am confidentially enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received.\n\nHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\n\nI will call you later.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDonald Trump\n\nThe letter, which a White House official confirmed was authentic, was dated days after the White House said U.S. troops were leaving northern Syria in advance of a Turkish invasion, following a phone call between Trump and Erdo\u011fan. The Turkish invasion was launched Oct. 9, and it was unclear when and whether Erdo\u011fan received the letter.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have since assailed Trump\u2019s move as a foreign-policy disaster and a betrayal of an American ally, the Kurds, whom Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headed to Turkey on Wednesday to meet with Erdo\u011fan and urge a ceasefire, while Trump distanced himself from the fighting, say it\u2019s \u201cnot our problem.\u201d", "description": "In a brash personal letter, President Donald Trump warned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan not to be a \u201ctough guy\u201d or a \u201cfool,\u201d and said he risked...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS534_19trum_ZG_20191002210940.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
