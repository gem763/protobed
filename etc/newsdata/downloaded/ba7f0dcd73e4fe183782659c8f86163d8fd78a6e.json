Other times I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s a job. #lucky #lucifer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt comes after Lucifans were treated to the first look at Tom\u2019s duet with Lesley-Ann Brandt in the episode.\n\nShot entirely in black and white, it will be set in alternate universe from the 1940s.\n\nLucifer and Lesley\u2019s character Mazkieen are going to make sweet music together on the show, as this classy picture of them sat behind a piano shows.\n\n\u2018I would say on this episode, we take a trip down memory lane with Lucifer,\u2019 Tom spilled to Entertainment Weekly about the musical. \u2018We tell a story that answers the question a lot of fans have been asking actually.\n\n\u2018The lovely thing about this episode is you see a lot of our regular characters in a different light. There\u2019s an element to Lucifer where he seems to be from the Oscar Wilde period. And to see the other characters fall back into that style is quite interesting.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that none other than singer Kelly Clarkson might make an appearance, as she was recently spotted on set and is a massive fan of the show.\n\nLucifer seasons one to three are available on Amazon Prime while season 4 is on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
