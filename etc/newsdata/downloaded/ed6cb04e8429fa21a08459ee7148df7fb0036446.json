He served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs from 2009-2013. Daniel Fried, a foreign service officer for 40 years, was assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs from 2005-2009. He is now with the Atlantic Council.\n\nThe recent revelations about President Trump\u2019s treatment of Ukraine catalogue a number of potentially serious misdeeds, including abuse of power, extortion of a foreign leader, violation of campaign finance laws and a conspiracy to cover up all of the above by storing records of phone conversations on a top-secret server in the White House.\n\nBut as investigations proceed and Americans consider these revelations, they should hold in mind another transgression: the president\u2019s egregious mistreatment of one of the country\u2019s most distinguished ambassadors. Even before the rough transcript of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released, we knew that the administration had prematurely curtailed the appointment of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch following public attacks on her by the president\u2019s eldest son and by his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Administration officials then falsely claimed that she was leaving her post \u201cas planned.\u201d Now, we also know that Trump went on to denigrate the ambassador in a phone call to a foreign leader, telling Zelensky that \u201cthe woman\u201d was \u201cbad news\u201d and vaguely but ominously noting that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nPresidents are entitled to have their own ambassadors in place and to expect those ambassadors to implement their policies. But the consequences of Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to punish a top U.S. representative, and to disparage her in a conversation with a foreign government, should not be underestimated. Allowing this to stand would not only have a chilling effect on the entire diplomatic corps but also could undermine U.S. foreign policy more broadly.\n\nBoth of us served as assistant secretaries of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, as well as on the staff of the National Security Council, under Republican and Democratic presidents. We know the importance of having representatives abroad who serve the country regardless of which party happens to be in power at any given time. It was our honor to work for many years with many of them, and none was more professional, capable or nonpartisan than Yovanovitch, who loyally and diligently served administrations from both parties for several decades \u2014 including as ambassador in demanding posts such as Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Ukraine. We know her as professional, disciplined and dedicated.\n\nIt is impossible to know what \u201cthings\u201d Trump was suggesting to Zelensky that the ambassador was going to go through, but it is impossible to conjure up any benign interpretation of those disturbing words. Yovanovitch, and all Foreign Service officers whose oath is to the country and the Constitution, deserve better.\n\nLike the military, the Foreign Service is an institution imbued with a culture of sacrifice, professionalism and loyalty \u2014 both up through the chain of command to the country\u2019s elected leaders and down to the most junior officers. America\u2019s diplomats serve around the world, in pleasant posts and war zones. Sometimes they wear suits, and sometimes they wear body armor. And sometimes they don\u2019t come home. Through it all, they serve the country by selflessly contributing their expertise in foreign languages, foreign cultures and getting things done.\n\nIt takes much time and effort to build a strong institution, but tearing it down can happen fast. Morale at the State Department is low, applications to join the Foreign Service are at the lowest level since 2008, and many senior officers have retired, resigned or been pushed out. These trends will only worsen if diplomats must live in fear that they will be cast aside for failing to support a president\u2019s personal or partisan agenda. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 who prided himself on restoring \u201cswagger\u201d to the State Department and committed himself to reinvigorating it \u2014 should thus be asked to explain how his organization is going to function if its best people must live in fear of presidential denunciation and retribution for doing their jobs. Secretary of State Colin Powell, a retired four-star general, told many of the career Foreign Service officers who served there that they were his diplomatic \u201cbattalion commanders.\u201d As a former Army officer himself, Pompeo should know better than others that leaders who denigrate and demean their troops do not win many battles.\n\nWhat Yovanovitch was doing in Ukraine \u2014 along with her colleagues from the European Union, International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions \u2014 was the tireless, difficult work of pressing the Ukrainian government to fight corruption, push ahead with reforms and continue to resist Russia\u2019s aggression. It was not her job to press the Ukrainians to focus on what Trump apparently wanted them to focus on, namely digging up information to further his political interests. That Trump was apparently willing to leverage U.S. military assistance \u2014 potentially leaving Ukraine vulnerable to military threats from Russia \u2014 to advance those political interests is shocking and deeply damaging. That he was apparently willing to throw a U.S. ambassador under the bus as part of that effort makes it even worse.", "description": "The president\u2019s politicized assault on the Foreign Service is destroying diplomacy.", "authors": ["Philip Gordon", "Daniel Fried", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/i_YBBrKcWaV6VOo-BqXgwzaXVXQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UTXO3YFH7MI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
