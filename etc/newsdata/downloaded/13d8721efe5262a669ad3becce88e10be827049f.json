It is no ordinary towel, either: a gift from his family, it is covered in messages freighted with meaning.\n\nIn one corner is inscribed the motto la humildad te hace grande - 'humility makes you great'; in another are pictures of his wife Tamara and their children Enzo and Eric; there are also the legends 'Liverpool FC' and 'You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone'.\n\n\u201cAll in one towel!\u201d Adrian says, with a laugh. \u201cSo imagine how special it is.\u201d\n\nIt certainly is precious for Adrian. The Liverpool goalkeeper freely admits he is a superstitious sort: it is why the towel is yellow \u2013 the colour of his goalkeeper\u2019s shirt at his first club, Real Betis \u2013 and why it carries the number 13, the only number he will wear.\n\nBoth yellow and 13 represent good luck in Spain. Adrian was offered the No1 jersey when he left Spain to join West Ham six years ago because first-choice goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen wore 22. He turned it down.\n\nIt would have happened at Liverpool, too, where there was the twist of Alisson Becker taking the No1 shirt before there was even a hint of Adrian signing. Up until then Alisson had worn, yes, 13.", "description": "Before every game, Adrian places a yellow towel in his goal.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/17/TELEMMGLPICT000213281603-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bquhm-8k55P1cg4FdiiMqgFjlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
