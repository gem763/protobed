Photo: Pat Carroll/NY Daily News via Getty Images\n\nIn the New York Times today, restaurant critic Pete Wells spoke a truth few had dared say before: Peter Luger Steak House is bad.\n\nWells awarded the famous Brooklyn steakhouse zero stars, down from the two stars Frank Bruni had awarded in 2007. Ruth Reichl gave the steakhouse three stars for the Times in 1995. But the most telling aspect of Wells\u2019s harsh review is how he implicitly acknowledges that Luger hasn\u2019t just gone downhill. Luger was always bad, even when people talked endlessly about how good it was.\n\n\u201cThe shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish,\u201d he says. \u201cThe steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified by corn syrup.\u201d The service has always been unfriendly. The tomatoes have always been flavorless and expensive. It\u2019s always been annoying that it doesn\u2019t accept credit cards. I would add to this list of complaints that the dining room has always been overlit \u2014 \u201cbrutally illuminated,\u201d as Bruni said in 2007.\n\nLuger\u2019s advocates have always acknowledged its flaws, sometimes trying to paint them as positives. Wells says he actually likes the bright lighting and that service at Luger used to be \u201ccharmingly brusque,\u201d though he now acknowledges that it\u2019s simply rude. Most often, Luger fans say the restaurant\u2019s flaws should be overlooked in the face of its transcendent, awesome steaks. But as Wells (and even Bruni 12 years earlier) note, the quality of steak at Luger itself, both in the aging and the cooking, is uneven. This is inexcusable at a time when excellent steak is ubiquitous, if you are willing to pay for it.\n\nSteakhouses are the simplest fine-dining restaurant model to execute, which is why there are so many of them and why they work as national chains. The Capital Grille has 59 locations and has more consistent execution, better service, better sides, better lighting, and a better wine list than Peter Luger. I\u2019m not saying Capital Grille, corporate cousin to the Olive Garden, is my very favorite steakhouse in New York \u2014 I\u2019d sooner go to Quality Meats or Strip House, given the choice \u2014 but that Luger can only stand out from its cookie-cutter corporate competition by being worse in various ways is precisely why the hype has never made any sense.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
