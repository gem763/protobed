It was the attorney general who was the force behind the scenes agitating for it to come out, said the former official.\n\nOthers advocating for the memo to be released included White House counsel Pat Cipollone and White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland, according to the current official.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and officials on the National Security Council were far more hesitant about releasing the memo of the conversation, the official added. They worried about the precedent it would set for conversations with other foreign leaders as well as the appropriateness of releasing transcripts.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Justice Department said Barr was unaware of Trump invoking the attorney general in the matter until \"several weeks after the call took place,\" when it learned of the whistleblower complaint. DOJ said the intelligence community\u2019s internal watchdog referred the matter to the department as a potential campaign finance violation.\n\n\"The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other matter,\" spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \"The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.\"\n\nNew Window How to read Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president: A line-by-line analysis of the conversation that launched an impeachment inquiry.\n\nKupec said the DOJ received a referral in August about the call between Trump and Zelensky, but decided not to open an investigation.\n\n\u201cRelying on established procedures set forth in the Justice Manual, the Department\u2019s Criminal Division reviewed the official record of the call and determined, based on the facts and applicable law, that there was no campaign finance violation and that no further action was warranted,\u201d Kupec said.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to rope Barr into the conversation, which until Wednesday had not been known, provoked fury from Democrats. Rep. Jerry Nadler, who as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee will oversee the panel\u2019s impeachment efforts, demanded on Twitter that \u201cat a minimum, AG Barr must recuse himself until we get to the bottom of this matter.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff called it \u201cabsurd\u201d that DOJ declined to open an investigation into the intelligence watchdog\u2019s referral of the whistleblower complaint, and said Barr's potential involvement added \"another layer of depravity\" to the controversy. He claimed it was easy to see why the department was blocking it from being turned over to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWell, that will come as news, or at least it should, to the director of national intelligence who is charged, among other things, with detecting foreign interference in our elections and reporting to Congress about foreign interference in our elections,\u201d he said in a news conference.\n\nThe call readout does not include any reference, explicit or otherwise, to the aid money that Trump reportedly directed his acting chief of staff to withhold from the Ukraine about a week before the call took place. Trump does mention numerous times how the U.S. spends \"a lot of effort and a lot of time\" assisting Ukraine.\n\nAnd after Zelensky brought up a potential purchase of missiles from the U.S., Trump asked Zelenksy \"to do us a favor though\" and look into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine played some role in a cache of emails being stolen from the Democratic National Committee leading up to the 2016 election, mentioning by name the cybersecurity firm the DNC retained to investigate the hack.\n\nTrump appeared to be asking Zelensky to further examine the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation that dogged the first half of Trump's term, telling Zelensky that the probe was \u201cnonsense\u201d and panning Mueller's congressional testimony the day before as \u201cvery poor\u201d and \u201cincompetent.\"\n\n\u201cThey say a lot of it started with Ukraine,\u201d Trump said, alluding to a theory often pushed by Giuliani.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.\u201d\n\nBarr has appointed a DOJ prosecutor to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation, which Trump and his supporters have repeatedly claim stemmed from political bias.\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See where House lawmakers stand on impeachment\n\nDOJ said Wednesday that team is looking into the role Ukraine played in any counterintelligence activities against Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, and that Barr had not reached out to Ukraine as part of that investigation but that \u201ccertain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information\u201d to the head of that probe.\n\nThe release comes after multiple days of wrangling by lawmakers to compel the administration to turn over a whistleblower complaint regarding the call. Its release also marks a change in the White House\u2019s strategy of near-universal stonewalling of congressional Democrats.\n\nTrump\u2019s acting intelligence chief had appeared intent to continue to block lawmakers from seeing the complaint in what Democrats argue is a breach of the intel community\u2019s whistleblower statute. It is still unclear if the White House intends to turn the complaint over, but Democrats have asserted that they require more than just a transcript of the call.\n\nAlso at the center of the controversy is the White House\u2019s mysterious decision around the same time to slow-walk hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid meant for Ukraine. The Washington Post reported this week that the president asked his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to delay the funds. And Trump\u2019s public explanations for withholding the aid \u2014 which was eventually released two weeks ago \u2014 have evolved over the last few days. While he first asserted that he wanted to ensure Zelensky would prioritize rooting out corruption, on Tuesday he cited other countries' reluctance to provide what he sees as their fair share of aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe president has repeatedly insisted that there was no quid pro quo on the call, denying that he dangled hundreds of billions of dollars in aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens, which the call readout released Wednesday appears to back up.\n\nTrump and his supporters have accused Biden of exerting his power as vice president to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor looking into an energy company with ties to Hunter Biden, though the prosecutor\u2019s firing was widely cheered by the international community.\n\n\u201cI heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved,\u201d Trump told Zelensky during the call, according to the document. Trump told the president later that \"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to be referencing a 2018 statement by Biden in which he boasts of ousting the prosecutor in question.\n\nZelensky responded to Trump by assuring him that he would be appointing a new prosecutor who would be \u201c100% my person, my candidate,\u201d and that \u201che or she will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s admission that he\u2019d broached the subject of an investigation into a political opponent with a foreign leader was a tipping point for a slew of Democrats \u2014 including vulnerable incumbents \u2014 who\u2019ve come out in support of an impeachment inquiry over the last week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers skewered the White House, asserting that the memo only bolstered their case for impeachment.\n\nThe memo and DOJ\u2019s \u201cacting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President\u2019s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cClearly, the Congress must act.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nShe accused the president of attempting \u201cto make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad,\u201d arguing that \u201ceither the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backed Pelosi up, telling reporters during a news conference that the White House memo \"absolutely validates the wisdom of\" Pelosi to initiate an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis is about abuse of power of an overreaching executive,\u201d he continued.\n\nSchiff, whose subpoena for the whistleblower complaint first catapulted the issue into the public eye, called the White House document \u201cmore damning than I and others had imagined,\u201d adding that he found it \u201cshocking on one level that the White House would release these notes and felt that somehow this would help the president's case or cause, because what those notes reflect is a classic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s backers seized on the fact that there was no explicit demand of an investigation in exchange for aid money, and argued that there was merit in looking into Biden\u2019s conflicts of interest.\n\n\u201cIt's okay to talk about an obvious conflict,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters at the Capitol, arguing that it was irrelevant if the Ukrainian prosecutor in question was actually corrupt. \u201cThe person arguing for him to be fired had a conflict of interest. If you don't see that conflict you are blind. If you don't see that there is a double standard here when it comes to trump and everybody else, you are blind. You are willfully blind.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reelection campaign shrugged off the memo\u2019s contents, deflecting blame and asserting that Trump's only intent was his desire to \u201cfight the corruption in Washington\u201d by politicians who \u201chave abused their power for personal gain for decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of their pure hatred for President Trump, desperate Democrats and the salivating media already had determined their mission: take out the President,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement, claiming that \u201cthe facts prove the President did nothing wrong. This is just another hoax from Democrats and the media, contributing to the landslide re-election of President Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nA handful of House Republicans also took to the House floor to slam Democrats and the media, pointing out that the readout contained no offer of quid pro quo from the president.\n\n\u201cThis isn't a call about leverage. This isn't a call about threats. This was a mutually appreciative and mutually laudatory call between two leaders who are trying to cleanup some of the garbage in their respective countries that has polluted politics,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz said, proclaiming that the \u201cfavor\u201d for which Trump asked was \u201con behalf of our nation.\u201d\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, the chamber\u2019s lone GOP voice of criticism, said Wednesday that the contents of the memo did not lessen his concern. While he declined to endorse Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry, he called the readout \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and said \u201cwe'll see where it leads.\u201d\n\nNancy Cook contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "But DOJ says Trump never talked with Barr about such an investigation.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/86/09/e7792641443a8dadbaf6c3bc975d/190925-donald-trump-gty-2-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
