In the video, Gillis calls his digs \u201cnice racism, good racism.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter Thursday, the comedian described himself as a \u201ccomedian who pushes boundaries,\u201d conceding: \u201cI sometimes miss.\u201d His \u201cintention,\u201d Gillis added, is \u201cnever to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\nTwitter users were incredulous that Gillis would consider his run-of-the-mill mockery boundary-pushing. Responses to his tweet Thursday were harsh.\n\nall these other white people telling a white person that his blatant racism and usage of racial slurs is fine bc \u201ccomedy\u201d \u2014 jhaunay-amanie (@wrightmywayout) September 13, 2019\n\nBeing racist isn\u2019t comedy or pushing the envelope. \u2014 Black Cherry Nerd (@cherry_LA) September 13, 2019\n\nUsing Chinese racial slurs isn't pushing comedic boundaries you melon.\n\n\n\nI mean yikes dude this statement alone just trashed any chance of salvaging yourself. \u2014 David Holmes (@RReplicant) September 13, 2019\n\nI think you\u2019re right. Mocking Chinese food, accents, and culture pushes so many boundaries! You have revolutionized the art of comedy. The creativity and genius that you showed by bringing up tired stereotypes with charisma that is even more tired was amazing. \u2014 Sarah Tonin (@BassedInShow) September 13, 2019\n\nHow highly original you are to be saying the same racist and stereotypical BS that your people spewed out for so long!\n\n\n\nI am soooooooo impressed funny man! \u2014 Not The Same Asian \u2744\ufe0f (@geesubay) September 13, 2019\n\nFixed it for ya pic.twitter.com/MsAxXw6uUj \u2014 Ana Rezende (@anarezende1919) September 13, 2019\n\nThere is a huge difference between a joke that doesn't land and a joke that's racist. You should know this, and should have known better. \u2014 Jesse 'Perpetually Tired' Jordan (@JesseNeon) September 13, 2019", "description": "The comedian says he's happy to apologize to \"anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7b0e6724000012277904bf.jpeg?cache=jo0v19qvu9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
