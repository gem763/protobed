Anyone reading this column already knows that Hunter Biden has been given an almost completely free pass by the MSM with regard to his involvement not just in Chinese business while his father was Vice President, but also in Ukraine.\n\nI have previously written about Hunter\u2019s business dealing and have addressed them extensively on my podcast. In short, While Joe was our nation\u2019s second-in-command, Hunter accompanied him on Air Force Two on state-sanctioned trips to China where, shortly thereafter, his team was awarded the investment banking deal mentioned above. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, he was named to the Board of Directors for Burisma Holdings and paid $50,000 per month, despite having no industry knowledge. When Burisma was being investigated by the Ukraine government, Papa Joe threatened to cut off U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired.\n\nNearly every legacy news outlet places the obligatory \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d in front of a description of events. There\u2019s nothing unsubstantiated about any of it. The above are facts from which reasonable people would draw an inference of corruption and influence peddling. My observation is that few to none of those reasonable people can be found in the MSM.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Turley, a man who prides himself in his consistent analysis and application of law regardless of circumstance, has written a must-read piece in TheHIll.com regarding the media\u2019s handling of the Hunter Biden affair, calling him \u201cHe who must not be named.\u201d Turley points to examples of interviewers at CNN, NBC, and MSNBC all quickly shutting down guests who dare to mention Hunter and Joe\u2019s activities in the context of discussing the current fake impeachment story involving President Trump. Turley is far from a Trump surrogate, and I urge you to read his commentary. The smattering of headlines after Hunter finally decided to emerge out of hiding on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America only underscores this point.\n\nNow, compare the treatment that Hunter is receiving to the way the mainstream media has covered the offspring of the current President. Don Jr., Eric, Ivanka, and even young Barron have found themselves to be targets of MSM scrutiny and attacks.\n\nFull disclosure, I am a close friend of Don Jr.\u2019s, a friendship to which many on social media try to attach some sort of nefarious source or motive (as if Don and I were, by traveling and hunting together, up to some sort of Hunter Biden antics). With the above duly noted, Don Jr. gave a strong interview last Friday on Brian Kilmeade\u2019s radio program. He pointed out the double standard at work in how the media is trying to suppress the Hunter Biden story vs. how he has been treated by the same group of \u201cobjective journalists.\u201d\n\nLook at what they tried to do to me for three years. I mean, these clowns tried to put me in jail for three years because I took an unsolicited phone call\u2026 You know, the double standard is pretty sick, Brian. I\u2019ve talked about it for a long time. We can play one way or we can play another way, but we\u2019ve got to be playing the same game\u2026 The reality is this: if Donald Trump Jr. flew on Air Force One with my father, the president, to China and came back with $1.5 dollars\u2014not $1.5 billion, just $1.5 dollars\u2014we\u2019d solve the fake news media problem because their heads would explode\u2026 If Donald Trump Jr. had a no-show gig on a corrupt Ukrainian oil company while my father was in charge of the issues over there\u2026 minor details. I\u2019ve never been in energy or oil. Minor details. I don\u2019t speak Ukrainian.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about Don Jr., or any of the Trumps, his point is well made. There is little question that if he, or any of his siblings, were engaged in Hunter Biden-type affairs, not only would the MSM scrutinize the dealings with breathless wall-to-wall special reporting from CNN to 60 Minutes. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi would likely throw every clause of the Constitution in a bonfire if it meant she could impeach the president\u2019s children along with him.\n\nThere is a literary archetype for the character that is Hunter Biden. He is the ne\u2019er-do-well offspring of the privileged and powerful man who needs to be helped and coddled but nevertheless ends up becoming an embarrassment for the father. Once the problem becomes bad enough, the powerful pater familias has to step in to help save his ne\u2019er-do-well son. That is exactly what has happened here with the Biden campaign telling news organizations to lay off poor Hunter.\n\nThis is more than a rant about unfairness in the media. We are all well aware of that. What should be of primary concern is just how much we tolerate this kind of media bias and disinformation. We are not doing enough to fight back.\n\nWhile liberals are openly flaunting the inherent hypocrisy of their positions, driving around the country in their gas-guzzling SUVs adorned with \u201c#Resist\u201d bumper stickers, conservatives just continue enabling their behavior allowing the MSM to dictate the terms of the national discourse. We are not doing enough to resist a biased media and the threat it poses to our continued freedom. Maybe we need a national \u201cChange the Channel\u201d day. Conservatives all across the country in airports, restaurants, health clubs, and hotel lobbies could walk up to the host or attendant and say \u201cplease change the channel\u201d when they are televising biased news programming in their public areas.\n\nIn all the fake news media malice of the Trump-era, we have forgotten that a free press belongs to the us, the American citizens\u2014not to the journalists. They work for us. Their job? To tell the truth, protect American liberty, and not play favorites.\n\nCharlie Kirk is the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, the nation\u2019s largest and fastest growing conservative youth organization with a presence on over 1,400 college and high school campuses; he is also host of \u201cThe Charlie Kirk Show.\u201d", "description": "Charlie Kirk writes: \"Once the problem becomes bad enough, the powerful\u00a0pater familias\u00a0has to step in to help save his ne\u2019er-do-well son.
