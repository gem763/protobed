If you tell me [your system] can do it, get it here now.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia faces a sophisticated threat from both Iran and its regional proxies. Iran has one of the longest-running drone development programs in the region, and it has been arming various groups with military hardware capable of doing real damage. These weapon systems offer less powerful militaries and even insurgents the ability to effectively strike a superior force for a relatively low cost.\n\nSaudi Arabia has the world's third-largest military budget, but a drone and missile attack knocked half of its oil production capabilities offline and shut down roughly five percent of global oil production.\n\nThe problem is the traditional air defense systems, such as American-made Patriot missile batteries, that Saudi Arabia relies on are not designed to counter the threat posed by small, slow, low-flying drones. In the case of the most recent attacks, there is evidence the attack was launched from a location that would allow the incoming drones and missiles to bypass these systems anyway.\n\nAnd counter-drone technology is not yet effective enough to reliably combat the type of attack that took place this past weekend.\n\nWhen Saudi oil facilities were struck by drones in May, expert observers warned that the attack signaled that maritime shipping routes weren't the only energy targets vulnerable to attack.\n\nFor instance, Charles Hollis, a risk consultant with Falanx Assynt, told FT that the attack underlined \"that the Strait of Hormuz [is] not the only vulnerable Saudi oil export route.\"\n\nSome experts have previously expressed doubt that drones could be more than a nuisance, but the latest attacks demonstrated otherwise. Arthur Holland Michel at the founder and co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, told Insider that they confirm \"some of the worst fears among militaries and law enforcement as to just how much damage one can do\" with these systems.\n\nDrones and other unmanned systems are becoming an important component of modern warfare, one that offers asymmetric advantages.\n\n\"Around the world, militaries and security agencies are scrambling to catch up with this threat,\" Michel told Insider. \"There is no doubt about the fact that no one has quite cracked the code.\"", "description": "Drones have been used in attacks on Saudi airports, water facilities, and oil pipelines this year.
