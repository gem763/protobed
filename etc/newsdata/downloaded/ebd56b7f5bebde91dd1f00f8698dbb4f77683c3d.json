At its peak, the crowd covered less than 100 yards of the sidewalk. But the scene itself represented something much bigger: the fractured, divisive, sometimes ugly and often loud American political climate.\n\nProtests erupted outside the 150-year-old historically black college where inside a school auditorium President Donald Trump spoke to a room filled with more political allies than students.\n\nThe event was billed as a keynote speech on bipartisan success in criminal justice reform, which the president tied to the booming economy he takes credit for and that he told his audience has helped black people more than ever before.\n\nBenedict students, who the week prior pondered what questions they might ask the president once his surprise visit to the forum\" was announced, were asked to stay in their dorms.\n\nSeven students were allowed inside for the speech.\n\nSupporters of President Donald Trump gather at Benedict College as protesters demonstrate behind them Friday, Oct. 25, 2019. More\n\nThe requests for students and faculty to remain inside was a matter of security, school spokeswoman Kymm Hunter said. The school's police worked in conjunction with the Secret Service to develop a security plan out of \"safety concerns and threats of protests,\" she said.\n\nClasses were canceled, and students were served lunch inside their dorms from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nAs Trump spoke, protesters marched in opposition while supporters stood with flags waving and hands clapping. The two groups met at the gates, a couple hundred people in all. And it was loud, so loud that it was hard to hear either side clearly.\n\nAs the protesters chanted, \"Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,\" a supporter blew her whistle with every syllable. Shouts of \"No more years!\" overlapped with \"Four more years!\"\n\nSometimes they responded to one another, like when one group yelled \"Shut it down\" and the other yelled back, \"Build a wall.\" It was discord \u2013 not dialogue.\n\nBenedict students watched from dormitory windows.\n\nThe president's speech was front-loaded with thanks for various political allies and featured a three black speakers joining him on stage to talk about justice reform.\n\nProtestors demonstrate at Benedict College before the arrival of President Donald Trump Friday, Oct. 25, 2019. More\n\nAt the event, Trump was named the winner of the Bipartisan Justice Award. The award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, a nonprofit organization founded by 20 black Republicans and 20 black Democrats in 2015, is given annually to a public servant who has demonstrated the ability to work across the aisle to achieve meaningful progress in reforming the criminal justice system, according to the White House.\n\nTrump was honored for leadership in the passage of the First Step Act, which expands opportunities for elderly inmates to get released, increases the amount of good-time credit inmates can receive and has provisions to help inmates transition back into society.\n\nOne of the three welcomed on the stage was 45-year-old Tanesha Bannister of Columbia, who spoke of how the \"First Step Act\" that Trump helped usher through helped her.\n\nBannister was released in May after serving 16 years in prison. She was originally sentenced to life in prison in 2004 after she was convicted in a cocaine smuggling trial.\n\nTrump took no questions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives in Columbia to visit a criminal justice forum at Benedict College, Friday, Oct. 25, 2019.
