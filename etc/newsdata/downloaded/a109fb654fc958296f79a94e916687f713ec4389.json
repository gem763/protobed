Each municipality of the marathon course has been working hard so far,\" Koike said when she met the press. \"I want to think about what would be the best (approach).\"\n\nKoike said she is aware that athlete-first arrangements are essential but that the matter should be addressed in a larger context of how to achieve the success of the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Tokyo Gov Yuriko Koike, irked by the International Olympic Committee's plan to move the 2020 Summer Games marathon and race walking events to Sapporo, quipped Thursday they should be held somewhere on Russia-held, Japan-claimed islands off Hokkaido if cooler weather conditions are needed.
