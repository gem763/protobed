The update will be available this week.\n\nRemote Play will now let you stream games from your console to any Android device running version 5.0 or above. This has actually been a feature on certain Android phones since 2014, but only ones made by Sony \u2014 now there\u2019ll just be a Remote Play app in the Play store for anyone to download. Sony added iOS compatibility earlier this year, so the expansion of Android support always seemed likely.\n\nMeanwhile, the party chat feature has doubled the number of users from eight to 16 and should have better connectivity and audio quality, Sony says. There\u2019s also a new voice-to-text feature that transcribes text and displays it on the PS4 Second Screen mobile app, though it\u2019ll only be available in the US for now. Sony didn\u2019t say whether the feature will come to other regions.", "description": "Sony has announced version 7.00 of the PlayStation 4\u2019s system software, which centers around updates to Remote Play and party functionality.
