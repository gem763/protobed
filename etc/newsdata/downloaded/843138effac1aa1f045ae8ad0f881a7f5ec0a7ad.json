Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservative Party won 121 seats and a 34.5 percent share, or 6.1 million votes.\n\nTrudeau, in Montreal, thanked supporters and staff Tuesday for the victory.\n\n\u201cYou did it, my friends. Congratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom coast to coast to coast tonight, Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity and they voted in favor of a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Trudeau on Twitter for a \u201cwonderful and hard-fought victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada is well served,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!\u201d\n\nGoing into the election, CBC\u2019s Poll Tracker gave the Liberals a slight edge of 32 to 31.6 percent over the Conservative Party. Conservatives made substantial gains Monday, earning some 20 seats more than they did in 2015.\n\nHowever, Trudeau\u2019s win falls below the 170 seats needed for a majority and is a loss of 30 seats from the 2015 election when he rode into power on charisma, good looks and promises of re-liberalizing Canada\u2019s image that had been pulled right under the Conservatives\u2019 rule.\n\nThe source of Trudeau\u2019s losses Monday could be his image was tarnished shortly after the campaign began in September, when the first of three photos emerged showing him in brownface and wearing a turban.\n\n\u201cThis is something I shouldn\u2019t have done many years ago,\u201d he said of an old yearbook photo. \u201cI take responsibility for my decision to do that. I didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time. I now realize it was.\u201d\n\nCandidates attacked Trudeau for it, including Scheer, who has repeatedly stated he won\u2019t walk in Toronto\u2019s LGBT Pride Parade. Scheer, 40, has also faced scandal during this campaign, coming under scrutiny for being a dual citizen with a U.S. passport. When questioned why he never mentioned his U.S. citizenship, he replied, \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me before about it.\u201d He has since said he will renounce the citizenship he received through his U.S.-born father.\n\nIn his concession speech Tuesday, Scheer said voters sent a message to Trudeau and his Liberal Party.\n\n\u201cWhile tonight\u2019s result isn\u2019t what we wanted, I am also incredibly proud \u2014 proud of our team, proud of our campaign and proud of the bigger and stronger Conservative team that we will send to Ottawa,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice, and Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d\n\nThe minor but strong conservative Quebec party, the Bloc Quebecois, gained about twice as many seats (32) as it did in the last vote. Elizabeth May\u2019s Green Party won three and the Independent Party one. The left-wing New Democrat Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, took a substantial hit after winning 44 seats four years ago.\n\n\u201cThank you, Canada,\u201d Singh tweeted early Tuesday. \u201cWhat a night \u2014 and what an unforgettable journey this campaign has been. With our new NDP caucus in Ottawa, I\u2019m incredibly excited to continue our critical work to achieve the priorities that we\u2019ve heard from people across this country.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party has won enough seats to secure him a second four-year term following a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
