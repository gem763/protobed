The IIHS named the Model 3 a \"Top Safety Pick+,\" the second all-electric vehicle to win that designation this year after the Audi e-tron.\n\nThe Model 3 beat out the Chevy Bolt, which fell short in one of its crash tests earlier this year. The Bolt's headlights also got a poor rating due to excessive glare.\n\nWhile Tesla's older Model S earned generally good marks in 2017 testing by IIHS, it missed out on a Top Safety Pick rating because of less-than-stellar results in one of its crash tests.\n\nThe IIHS subjected the Model 3 to four different crash tests: small overlap crashes on the driver and passenger sides, a moderate overlap test, and a side crash test. The vehicle performed well in all four tests.\n\n\"The dummy's position in relation to the steering wheel and instrument panel after the crash test indicates that the driver's survival space was maintained very well,\" IIHS wrote after the moderate overlap front crash test.\n\nThe IIHS was impressed with Tesla's headlights, which illuminated the road without causing glare for other drivers. IIHS also praised Tesla's automatic emergency braking technology, which successfully stopped the car in time to prevent collisions.\n\nListing image by IIHS", "description": "Insurance industry group rates Model 3 one of the safest cars.", "authors": ["Timothy B.
