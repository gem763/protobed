The Afghan intelligence agency said 30 to 40 Taliban fighters launched the attack about 2 a.m.\n\nTwo security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the news media, said the Taliban entered the city from several directions and for a time blocked a key highway linking Kabul, the capital, with the rest of the north. It was the first time the Taliban had gained any ground in Pol-e-Khomri.\n\nMohammad Nasim Mudabber, a lawmaker in Pol-e-Khomri, said the battle for the city was ongoing, with Taliban fighters hiding in civilian homes and using residents as \u201chuman shields.\u201d He said residents could hear machine-gun fire and rocket attacks and that security forces were \u201cmoving ahead slowly to prevent civilian casualties\u201d and had not yet carried out house-to-house searches for the militants.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have casualties, but we don\u2019t have a number yet,\u201d Mudabber said.\n\n[Taliban launches large-scale attack on key Afghan city even as talks with U.S. continue]\n\n\n\nA man and boy receive treatment in a hospital after the attack in Kunduz. (Bashir Khan Safi/Associated Press)\n\nIn the northeastern province of Badakhshan on Sunday evening, an explosion at a soccer field in Faizabad, the provincial capital, killed Nazir Mohammad Niazi, the city\u2019s former mayor. A key anti-Taliban militia leader, he was considered a crucial bulwark against the militants.\n\nEarly Sunday, U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted that the latest round of talks with the Taliban had concluded in Doha, Qatar, and the sides were on \u201cthe threshold of an agreement.\u201d He said he would travel to Kabul later in the day for further consultations. Marathon talks with Taliban delegates went late into the night last week as an unofficial Sunday deadline for a deal loomed.\n\nThe attack on Pol-e-Khomri came one day after Taliban militants launched a major assault on the large northern city of Kunduz from multiple sides, provoking a day-long standoff with Afghan forces. Kunduz has fallen to the Taliban twice in recent years but is now under government control.\n\nOn Saturday evening, as a police spokesman gathered with officials at a busy roundabout in the city, a suicide bomber struck, killing the spokesman, Col. Sayed Sarwar Hussaini and at least nine others.\n\nThe attack occurred shortly after acting defense minister Asadullah Khalid visited the city and assured residents that it would not fall to militants. Army Gen. Austin \u201cScott\u201d Miller, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, also visited Kunduz on Saturday, but left shortly before the suicide attack.\n\n[A family scarred by the Afghan war hopes a peace deal will make their sacrifices worth it]\n\nOn Sunday, the Interior Ministry said the \u201centire Kunduz city has been cleared\u201d and that the situation there was \u201cback to normal.\u201d Officials said dozens of Taliban fighters, 20 members of the security forces and five civilians were killed.\n\nThe attack in Kunduz was a brazen display of violence amid negotiations in Qatar. Khalilzad tweeted Saturday that he \u201craised the Kunduz attack in talks today, telling the Taliban that violence like this must stop.\u201d\n\nIn Kabul, presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the attack was \u201ccompletely in contradiction with what [the Taliban] talk about in the peace process in Doha.\u201d\n\nThe United States and the Taliban have met for nine rounds of talks in 10 months. The Taliban wants all foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan. The United States has demanded a complete cease-fire and has insisted that the Afghan government be included in separate talks after a deal is reached. The Taliban has refused to include the Afghan government in ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani is forging ahead with plans to hold a presidential election on Sept. 28. He is facing increasing pressure to postpone the vote, which has been delayed twice before, amid concerns that it could thwart prospects for peace and lead to more violence.\n\nAlready, election officials have said about 2,000 polling places will not be open on election day because of security issues. This week, his top competitor, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, said he would be willing to drop out in the name of peace.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Taliban decimated Afghanistan\u2019s film industry.
