On Monday, Jake Arsenault got a special visit from an even more famous frankfurter.\n\nAn Oscar Mayer Wienermobile gave Jake a lift to the movies with some friends. The company, which operates six of the iconic hot dogs-on-wheels, said in a statement they wanted to give Arsenault a special treat for his photo.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw Jake\u2019s school photo, we knew we had to do something to reward him for the most epic school ID we\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019re so excited that Jake chose to share his Wienermobile ride with his friends and family,\" a written statement from Matt Riezman, Oscar Mayer's associate director of marketing, says.\n\nJake Arsenault poses in his hot dog suit in front of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on Monday. (Photo: Photo courtesy Oscar Mayer)\n\nIn the days since his school ID photo went viral, Jake has been recognized in public as \"the hot dog boy,\" Jake's father, Craig Arsenault, told USA TODAY Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hysterical ... he\u2019s been relishing this whole thing,\u201d Arsenault said.\n\nPreviously: On a dare from dad, boy wears hot dog suit for 4th grade photo. The image went viral\n\nThe adventure began weeks ago when Jake wasn't quite sure what to wear for school photos.\n\nWhen his mom told 9-year-old Jake to wear an old hot dog Halloween costume, Craig thought it was a great idea.\n\n\u201cDude, do it. ... It\u2019ll be legendary,\u201d Arsenault remembers encouraging his son. He says he promised Jake $10 if he went through with wearing the costume to the Biddeford Intermediate School photo day several weeks ago.\n\nAfter Jake went through with it, the school provided him with an ID featuring a photo of him in the hot dog suit. (He also has a picture without the costume.)\n\nNow, with Halloween nearing, Jake isn't quite sure what he will wear. But both of his ideas involve hot dogs, Craig said.\n\nMaybe he'll just go in the now famous suit. Or maybe he'll go as an oversized version of his school ID photo.\n\nJake Arsenault's Biddeford Intermediate School ID shows him posing in a hot dog costume \u2014 the result of a bet with his dad.
