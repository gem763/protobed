CEO Nat Friedman fielded questions from employees and attempted to explain why the company would renew a $200,000 contract with the immigration agency. The Verge has obtained a transcript of the conversation.\n\n\u201cThis is an important topic not just because we find this issue of US immigration policy so odious, offensive, abhorrent, cruel, evil, such a meaningful topic,\u201d Friedman said, according to the transcript. \u201cI personally feel that. I know many other Hubbers share that thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think we\u2019ll have to evolve our positions there\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, employees pressed executives about how the company would work with non-democratic countries, including China. Friedman said he didn\u2019t have a firm answer, but noted that open-source software was available in countries like Iran.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s another one, a non-democratic country, and I do think we\u2019ll have to evolve our positions there,\u201d Friedman told staff. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some US sanctions go into effect against Chinese AI companies around facial recognition just last night. So we\u2019re not the only body that\u2019s trying to ensure there are human rights in all these countries.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201con net,\u201d the company\u2019s approach \u201cis that we want to lean towards more access to GitHub for every developer, even in countries that aren\u2019t democratic, even in teams that are doing things that we might disagree with.\u201d\n\nThe transcript was also obtained by Motherboard, who first reported the meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of competitors who are also doing business with the federal government\u201d\n\nIn the meeting, Friedman also emphasized that he did not believe discontinuing the contract would have an impact on ICE\u2019s enforcement approach. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that unplugging technologies from government agencies will have an effect on policy,\u201d Friedman told employees. \u201cThere is no positive impact of [revoking service] on the actual outcomes for migrants or for people who are affected by those policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese folks have choice, too,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have a lot of competitors who are also doing business with the federal government, and there are open-source alternatives that are out there.\u201d\n\nExecutives at GitHub made clear that the decision to maintain the ICE contract was made after extensive consultation with Microsoft\u2019s top executives, specifically naming CEO Satya Nadella, president Brad Smith, and cloud VP Scott Guthrie. However, Friedman denied that the company pressured GitHub to maintain the contract, saying instead that it was important for the two leadership teams to be aligned on contracting policy.\n\n\u201cIt would have been very challenging for us to take a position on this [that\u2019s] very different from Microsoft\u2019s position,\u201d Friedman told employees. \u201cThis is an area where we would probably prefer to be synchronized more with Microsoft.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we continue to provide those tools to such organizations, we are continuing to take part in the oppression of immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe statements come after a week of escalating tensions over GitHub\u2019s work with ICE. In a leaked email earlier this week, Friedman told staff that the company planned to renew a $200,000 contract with ICE for an enterprise server. Friedman said GitHub wouldn\u2019t know how ICE used the product, and that the company would also donate $500,000 to immigration charities. But the answer hasn\u2019t sat well with all employees, many of whom have signed on to a petition calling on GitHub to drop the contract.\n\nIn the email, Friedman stressed that the $200,000 contract was \u201cnot financially material\u201d for the company. For some, that raised an obvious question: why bother?\n\nFriedman said GitHub didn\u2019t want to be in the business of deciding when to unplug software, and instead would use its \u201ccorporate voice\u201d to advocate against policies the company opposes. \u201cOur voice is heard better by policymakers when we have a seat at the table,\u201d Friedman\u2019s email said.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard for some workers not to see the direct financial benefit of continuing to work with government agencies. As one GitHub employee pointed out to The Verge, Microsoft also pursues contracts that are potentially much more lucrative. The company is in the running for a massive, $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. \u201c$200,000 from ICE, no one cares about,\u201d the GitHub employee said. \u201cBut that contract is significant to Microsoft.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not satisfied with GitHub\u2019s now-public stance on this issue\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has itself faced questions from employees about working with ICE. Last year, hundreds of employees signed on to a letter calling for the company to stop providing cloud services to ICE. More recently, a group of Microsoft employees left a message of public support for GitHub activists on a newly made GitHub repo.\n\n\u201cEvery single product and service that ICE has available to them makes them more efficient, able to operate at a bigger scale, and more capable of committing widespread human rights abuses,\u201d the workers said. \u201cIf we continue to provide those tools to such organizations, we are continuing to take part in the oppression of immigrants.\u201d\n\nSo far, Microsoft has yet to heed that call. The company has more than $8 million worth of contracts with ICE for Office 365 and related services, and has repeatedly said that it won\u2019t turn down work with the US government for political reasons. \u201cDo we want to politicize every single aspect of daily life?\u201d Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in an interview with The Verge last year.\n\nBut the controversy at GitHub \u2014 and across the tech industry \u2014 seems likely to continue. \u201cWe are not satisfied with GitHub\u2019s now-public stance on this issue,\u201d GitHub employees said in their open letter. \u201cGitHub has held a \u2018seat at the table\u2019 for over two years, as these illegal and dehumanizing policies have escalated, with little to show for it.\u201d\n\nThe end result has been growing tension between GitHub\u2019s management and its workers, with management increasingly concerned about public perception of the company\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cOne thing I do want to ask of everybody is that we can keep this conversation confidential and have an open and transparent dialogue,\u201d one executive said during the all-hands. \u201cIt is unfortunate that somebody leaked Nat\u2019s email before we had a chance to post it to the press.\u201d", "description": "Tensions continue to grow over GitHub\u2019s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as employee activists pressure the company to cut ties with the agency.
