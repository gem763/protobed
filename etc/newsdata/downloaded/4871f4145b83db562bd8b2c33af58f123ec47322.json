In the same way that a bigger battery gives your cellphone more usage time, a bigger EV battery gives a longer range. The 40kWh Leaf can do about 250km before the battery is depleted; the 62kWh Leaf will do about 375km.\n\nBut what about charging infrastructure? Surely there aren\u2019t enough charging posts in South Africa? Well, that\u2019s why Generation.e organised the #EVRTAfrica, to show long-distance EV travel is possible, albeit with limitations.\n\nDo the maths: If your Leaf can do 250km on a charge, you\u2019ll have to recharge it four times to make the 760km trip from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard, though, since Jeffreys Bay, Knysna, George, Swellendam and Caledon each have high-speed chargers. The same goes for South Africa\u2019s other major routes, such as linking Jozi to Durban with high-speed chargers. The less glamorous aspect of the journey is the hour (roughly) you\u2019ll spend per charge if Eskom isn\u2019t offline.\n\nSo, if EV transport is this challenging, why bother? Because an EV can give you 100km from R18\u2019s worth of electricity; most cars struggle to get 100km from R100\u2019s worth of petrol.\n\nThey might be hamstrung for now, but global demand and innovation will drive EV prices down, reduce charging times and increase range.\n\nFor now, the best job for an EV is that of a city commuter. You can find a used BMW i3 EV in good nick for about R380 000 and less for a generation-one Leaf.\n\nIf money\u2019s no object, buy the ballistic new Jaguar I-Pace for about R1.7m.", "description": "After test-driving the Nissan Leaf on a two-day road trip from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town, Justus Visagie shares his insights on the electric car.", "authors": ["Justus Visagie"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9511/4fd04f43661e43fcbd95f0f845f28dbf.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
