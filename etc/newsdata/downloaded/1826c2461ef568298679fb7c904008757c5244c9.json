However, the inhuman treatment meted out by owners of these carriages has led to the animals collapsing on busy roads. The latest incident happened on the Via Dei Condotti. This is a busy shopping street and the horse apparently slipped on a manhole cover. Onlookers wanted the driver to take the animal to a vet but he waited for it to get back on its feet and then continued with his tour.\n\nThe Guardian reports that leaders, in Italy, want to stop the exploitation of these animals. They raised their voices after this incident of a horse collapsing came to light. Rinaldo Sidoli, an activist, described it as animal abuse. He opened up about the way horses are treated in Rome and how he wants Mayor Virginia Raggi \u201cto stop this unjustified exploitation of animals.\u201d The weight of the carriage is around 1760 pounds (800kg).\n\nWhen the weight of the occupants gets added it becomes a substantial load. Therefore, on an uneven surface, the hooves might slip and the horse carriage might lose balance - giving rise to avoidable accidents.\n\nItalian leaders have been urged to stop \u201cthe unjustified exploitation of animals\u201d after a horse collapsed as it pulled tourists through the narrow streets of Rome.\n\n\n\nThe horse fell on the Via dei Condotti, a busy shopping street in the city centre, on 17 \u2026 https://t.co/a6ERp9ZwfK \u2014 Dave Bedford (@moonmetothefly) October 20, 2019\n\nPast instances of accidents and deaths\n\nThe horse-drawn carriages of Rome are also known as botticelle and are lucrative businesses for their owners.\n\nTour operators usually charge $390 (\u20ac350) for the horse carriage to take a group of four people around important monuments in Rome over a two-hour period. There are past instances of some of these horses dying. In 2008, a horse died when a car struck it down near the Tiber River. There were tourists in the carriage. Some months later, another died when the noise of a passing truck startled it. In 2012, there was yet another death.\n\nIt was during summer and the driver was trying to force the reluctant animal back to work. Subsequently, a law was passed that imposed a ban on horse-drawn carriages from doing their rounds if the temperature exceeded 40C.\n\nRome takes horse carriages off burning streets. If you're anywhere in the world & see horse carriages, please bitch to tourist agencies, hoteliers, guides, & try to dissuade tourists from riding. Make a fuss.

Mayor Virginia Raggi has no plan to issue fresh licenses and drivers can opt for taxi permits. Rinaldo Sidoli, an activist said - \u201cThe sight of a horse falling to the ground left many tourists appalled.\u201d In his opinion, scenes of this nature spoil the image of the city and the authorities must take suitable action.\n\nVoices raised against ill-treatment of horses\n\nAccording to Wanted in Rome, Mayor Virginia Raggi had promised to ban the outdated practice of horse carriages entirely. That was in her election campaign three years ago. However, clashes continued between carriage drivers and animal rights' activists. The latter have described the streets of Rome as a \"cruel\" working environment for the animals. Many of them have been victims of the summer heat.
