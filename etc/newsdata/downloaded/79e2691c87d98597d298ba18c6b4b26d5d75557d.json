Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn one of the wildest close seasons of free agency in recent memory, Leonard joined up with Paul George to form a formidable pair under Doc Rivers, while Anthony Davis joined LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers to create a monster duo of their own.\n\nWith Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving signing with the Brooklyn Nets - although the former is expected to miss the year with a torn Achilles - it\u2019s easy to see how other teams are only becoming stronger by forming blockbuster pairings.\n\nBut Nurse said he felt good about his own team and they were setting \u201csuper high\u201d goals again this season.\n\n\u201cPredictions don\u2019t really factor too much into what you do,\u201d Nurse told reporters in Tokyo on Monday ahead of two preseason games against the Houston Rockets.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of confidence in our team, we like the players we have, and I say there\u2019s lots of paths to the title. Last year we found one, this year we\u2019ll have to find a different one.\n\n\u201cI always think that our objective is to win and win big.\u201d\n\nWith the departure of Leonard, forward Pascal Siakam is a big part of the Raptors\u2019 future following a breakout season in which he was named the NBA\u2019s most improved player and was influential in the finals triumph over the Golden State Warriors.\n\n\u201cI think Pascal is going to make another jump. I think he\u2019s going to improve immensely,\u201d said guard Kyle Lowry.\n\n\u201cHis talent is so much, the sky\u2019s the limit for Pascal. And for me, my job to help him is to keep him going, put him in good spots to be successful. But sometimes just get out of his way and let him be great,\u201d he added with a smile.\n\nWith the Raptors in Japan for the week, Lowry was also reminded of the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics and said he\u2019d jump at the chance to play for Team USA.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m chosen, I\u2019m in. If (USA Basketball managing director) Jerry (Colangelo) and coach Pop (Gregg Popovich) make that call, I\u2019m in. Hopefully I am here and trying to win another gold medal for my country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important thing for me to represent my country at the highest level.\u201d", "description": "The Toronto Raptors may not be favoured by many to defend their NBA title after losing star Kawhi Leonard to the Los Angeles Clippers, but head coach Nick Nurse said predictions didn't matter and his team would forge a new path to the championship.", "authors": ["Chris Gallagher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438062915&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960SX-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
