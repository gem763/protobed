I had just gone through a break up, which helps when it comes to writing songs, I guess. It helps vent the emotions.\n\nAww darling.\n\nNiall split with 22-year-old Pitch Perfect actor Hailee after about a year together.\n\nHailee Steinfeld and Niall Horan during the 2017 American Music Awards (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nDespite it\u2019s morose moments, the former One Direction singer still said the album is a \u2018fun\u2019 one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am just ready to go! The album is fun. There are some very sad moments, but for the most part it is a fun album. There are some nice melodies in there, some cool guitar riffs. I think my fans are going to enjoy it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Experiencing touring and being on stage every night, getting that buzz off the crowd and being with fans who have paid their well-earned money to come and watch only you \u2013 you learn a lot about yourself, you learn about what people want to listen to,\u2019 he added.\n\nThe Slow Hands hitmaker also revealed that his sultry new single Nice To Meet Ya was inspired by a brief flirtation he had with a woman during a night out.\n\nHe said: \u2018The lyrics came about from a half-true story. I was out one night and locked eyes with this girl. We got chatting, and she was with a group of her mates and I was with a group of my mates.\n\n\u2018It felt like every time I turned around \u2013 like the lyric says \u2013 she just kind of disappeared. But then over the course of the same night, in different bars around that same area, we would bump into each other.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a song that is basically like a movie that is based on a true story, and then you start changing stuff that makes the song start to sound a little bit more interesting.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGot a showbiz story?
