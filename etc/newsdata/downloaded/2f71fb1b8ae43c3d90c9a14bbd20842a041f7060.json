Here's why that's wrong Read more\n\nThe accusations come just a week after Trump warned that the city of San Francisco would receive a violation notice for allegedly letting needles and other waste go through storm drains into the Pacific Ocean, an allegation Mayor London Breed fiercely denied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this president taking swipes at our city for no reason other than politics,\u201d Breed said on Thursday. \u201cThere are no needles washing out to the bay or ocean from our sewer system, and there is no relationship between homelessness and water quality in San Francisco. It\u2019s just not a real issue.\u201d\n\nNathan Click, a spokesman for the governor, said: \u201cThis is not about clean air, clean water or helping our state with homelessness. This is political retribution against California, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has filed 60 lawsuits opposing Trump initiatives on the environment, immigration and health care.\n\nHousing advocates told the Guardian last week that the president\u2019s comments on homelessness push a harmful narrative that homeless people are bad for the environment.\n\n\u201cThis is the president of the United States that is putting out this nonsense and social stigma,\u201d Kelley Cutler, the human rights organizer for the Coalition on Homelessness, said. \u201cHe has a massive audience and he is putting out this narrative that is very concerning.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Wheeler said urban homelessness is taking a toll on the environment, citing news reports of \u201cpiles of human feces\u201d on streets and sidewalks.\n\nHe called on San Francisco to invest billions of dollars to upgrade its sewage treatment system and stop releasing inadequately treated waste into San Francisco Bay and the Pacific, a practice he said state regulators have long allowed.\n\nHe said an EPA review uncovered problems with California\u2019s handling of other federal clean water programs, including 23 significant discharges of pollutants in recent months that exceeded permit limits.\n\nThe investigation also found that the state had 202 community water systems that exceeded federal standards for the presence of contaminants such as arsenic and lead, putting nearly 800,000 people at risk, Wheeler said.\n\nEric Schaeffer, director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former head of civil enforcement at EPA, accused the president and Wheeler of using the agency to punish enemies.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to decide that homeless encampments are a major priority for Clean Water Act enforcement, when EPA has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US,\u201d Schaeffer said.\n\nEarlier this week, the EPA chief criticized the California Air Resources Board for a backlog of pending regulations intended to reduce smog. State officials blamed delays by Washington in approving the plans.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration moved to revoke California\u2019s decades-old legal authority to set automobile emission standards tougher than the federal government\u2019s.", "description": "The agency blames the homeless crisis for the problem, an allegation state authorities have fiercely denied", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c88d957d6744fab730fe08d60850199fef4c476/0_6_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cfe772adf0261c8153ff00fbacd0fce4", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
