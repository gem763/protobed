He also encouraged the union to \"engage in bargaining over all issues around-the-clock to get an agreement.\"\n\n\"Your members and our employees' lives are being disrupted, and they deserve our commitment to getting any remaining issues resolved as quickly as possible,\" Sandefur wrote to UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who oversees the union's GM department.\n\nSandefur, in the letter, said the company has repeatedly urged the UAW to participate in \"around-the-clock\" bargaining.
