It\u2019s the U.S. president, Philippine central bank governor Benjamin Diokno told a panel discussion in Singapore, with the audience bursting into laughter at his candid answer.\n\nA former economics professor who took the helm of the central bank in March, Diokno said the U.S. economy is growing due to the tax cut enacted under President Donald Trump, but the policy will exacerbate debt in the long run.\n\nThe Filipino central banker may have a reason for his quip: When the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, as the saying goes. The U.S.-China trade war -- with Trump objecting to many of the policies that have driven China\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy -- has rippled through emerging Asia and threatens to start a global recession.\n\n\u201cWhatever Trump does is really driving the markets. It affects everyone else,\u201d said Michael Ricafort, an economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila.\n\nTrumpian Tweet\n\nTrump, who wants to see stronger U.S. economic growth ahead of his re-election bid next year, has been outspoken in favoring more aggressive monetary-policy easing.\n\nLast week he tweeted that the U.S. Federal Reserve should cut rates to zero or less. On Wednesday, after the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate for a second meeting in a row, cutting by a quarter-point to 1.75%-2%, Trump was unimpressed: \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFed chief Jerome Powell has stressed the need for the U.S. central bank to remain independent from government pressure. Analysts have described Wednesday\u2019s move as a \u201chawkish cut,\u201d emphasizing that the Fed essentially sees these moves as insurance for an economy that remains basically healthy. Three Fed members dissented from the decision to cut, suggesting an unusual amount of discord on the policy board.\n\nSpeaking on a panel at the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore, Diokno said Trump\u2019s pressure on Powell is \u201cunfair\u201d and governments should respect central bank independence.", "description": "Trump Is Biggest Risk to World Economy, Says Philippine\u00a0Central Bank Governor", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb4c90191c128891872c27946613eba13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
