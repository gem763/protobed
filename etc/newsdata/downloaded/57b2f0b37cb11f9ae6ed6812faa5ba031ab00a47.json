But his campaign has been beset by gaffes and he has struggled to attract widespread support, alarming many KMT establishment figures.\n\nGou has made no secret of his desire to run for president. But he doesn't have long to decide. Under Taiwan's rules he must announce as a candidate by next Tuesday.\n\nAnalysts say he will likely join forces with KMT heavyweights, or Ko Wen-je, the independent mayor of Taipei who is popular among many younger voters.\n\nAlexander Huang, from Taipei's Tamkang University, told AFP Gou could create a \"third force\" in Taiwan's politics, chipping away at swing voters from both the main parties.\n\nGou's self-made tale is legendary in Taiwan and mimics the island's phenomenal economic success.\n\nBut the huge factories built in China under Gou have rattled critics over his perceived cosiness with Beijing's leadership.", "description": "Taiwan's richest man sensationally quit the opposition party on Thursday, rebuking his former political allies and strongly hinting that he would run as an independent in an upcoming presidential election.
