Smartwatches that don't make you like you have an electronic tag on your wrists", "language": "en", "text": "Fossil Android Wear\n\nfossil.com/uk, \u00a3279\n\nThe truly sad thing about smartwatches is that the one thing that you want most of all is that it doesn\u2019t actually look like a smartwatch.\n\nI always feel a faint pang of shame whenever my square fitness watch catches on my shirt sleeve and people notice it \u2013 or worse, I get a co-conspiratorial look from someone else wearing an Apple Watch.\n\nFossil\u2019s Android Wear watches take the bold design decision of not looking like an electronic tag on your wrist, with proper, circular faces and metal rims\n\nI always want to yell: \u2018I just use it to count my footsteps, so I can lose a few pounds, I\u2019m not a nerd like you.\u2019\n\nHence the appeal of Fossil\u2019s Android Wear watches, which take the bold design decision of not looking like an electronic tag on your wrist, with proper, circular faces and metal rims.\n\nIn most lighting conditions, you will be spared the natural shame and humiliation that comes from wearing a smartwatch.\n\nFossil\u2019s new fifth-generation watches (the Julianna and Carlyle) add heart-rate functions and GPS for running, and look pretty decent, too \u2013 although if the \u2018Julianna\u2019 is meant to be worn by women, they need pretty mighty wrists to carry it off, as it clocks in at 44mm.\n\nFitbit-style functions come courtesy of Google\u2019s free Fit app (although you can pair with others such as Strava on either Android or iPhone).\n\nThese Fossil watches are about the best Android Wear watches out there, and they work well (you swipe up, sideways and down to open alerts, see your calendar or see fitness data). But there\u2019s a faint sense Android Wear has been left to wither on the vine \u2013 and these feel slightly dated, even at a lower price than Apple Watch.", "description": "These Fossil watches are about the best Android Wear watches out there, and they work well (you swipe up, sideways and down to open alerts, see your calendar or see fitness data)", "authors": ["Rob Waugh Event For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/14/19332862-0-image-a-58_1570280922736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
