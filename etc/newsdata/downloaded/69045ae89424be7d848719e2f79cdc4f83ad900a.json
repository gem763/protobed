The 1960s were about free love and great music, but they were also about the systematic abuse of minorities. The 1920s, meanwhile, marked the beginning of the Jazz Age and true independence for women, but that sloped downward into the Great Depression and World War II. And people were even more blatantly racist.\n\nSo, how to celebrate the past in a way that\u2019s untainted by human error? Obviously, through the wholesome lens of a baking competition, which exists outside any realms influenced by time, space, or racism. Welcome \u2026 to The Great British Baking Show!\n\nLast week, the producers decided to introduce the show\u2019s first-ever Dairy Week and everyone\u2019s favorite lorry-driving daddy, Phil, was eliminated. Riding off that chaotic high, the showrunners decided this week would feature another brand new theme: the Roaring Twenties. What could that possibly mean? Bakes from that era?! Yes. But also, aesthetic decorations from that era, which makes this week one of the most artistically demanding thus far.\n\nTo start, Paul and Prue ask the bakers to make four custard pies with \u201920s-themed decorations, and because they heard the word \u201ccustard,\u201d half of the bakers go for something citrusy. Helena \u2014 or as she\u2019s known now known in the GBBS community, Grim-Joy \u2014 fashions lemon and lavender pies held together by the tentacles of a chocolate kraken. Prue can\u2019t get enough of her. Sophisticated Toddler Henry, meanwhile, decides to make a lemon and lime custard with raspberry curd that is inspired by arguably the greatest invention of the 1920s: Kool-Aid. Sorry, penicillin!\n\nSteph, last week\u2019s Star Baker, decides to fill her shortcrust pastry with a lemon, lime, and orange custard. \u201cShortcrust pastry is my nemesis,\u201d she says as she makes perfect shortcrust pastry. She\u2019s joined by Alice and her chocolate-orange entry; lemon and raspberry ripple custards from Priya; and Michael\u2019s mango-lime ginger custard.\n\nOnly a few brave souls dare to ignore citrus completely. For the umpteenth time, Michelle brings up her lovely Welsh garden, which has inspired her blueberry and white chocolate creme custard with edible flowers. Veterinarian Rosie, who we learn hates treating rabbits because \u201cthey just want to die,\u201d opts for a blackberry custard in a matcha tea shortcrust. On top, little elderflower jellies injected with flower designs. But the bravest among them is David, who says that instead of trying to be creative with his flavors, he\u2019s just going to make a simple vanilla custard with some glazed fruit. The simplicity will allow him to add hand-designed flapper-girl biscuits. Surprisingly, this is the only time flappers are mentioned in the episode.\n\nNow that we\u2019re halfway through the season, much less time is being spent on describing all the bakers\u2019 dishes, which means more time for watching how all the bakes come together. David creates his flapper girl biscuits with stunning precision and royal icing, and watching Rosie inject her jellies with flowers is nothing short of mesmerizing. Michael, usually one of the more talkative bakers, goes dead silent as he\u2019s got a lot on his plate: mango gel\u00e9e, meringue kisses, white-chocolate soil, piped ganache, candied lime peel, ginger honeycomb. He\u2019s got to live up to that Hollywood Handshake!\n\nIn the midst of all this, Rosie drops one of her tarts and it splatters in epic fashion. But Rosie is no Michael, who claims he\u2019s trying to get #mantears trending. She sniffs, says \u201coh,\u201d and carries on. This is a woman who witnesses the deaths of beloved pets on a fairly regular basis. You think she\u2019s gonna cry over spilled tart? Hell no. We love you, Rosie, our stoic kween!\n\nAfter two and a half hours, the judges make their way around to each counter to check out the 36 \u2014 well, 35 \u2014 custards on display. David is up first and his easy custard approach proves to have been the right bet because his bakes look like they\u2019re professionally made. Prue says, \u201cThat\u2019s a custard pie,\u201d and Paul does that thing where he\u2019s dead silent \u2014 and then hands out the season\u2019s second Hollywood Handshake. Michael and Henry pump their fists in celebration.\n\nMichael is handed similarly glowing feedback for his mango-lime situation, although Paul says he under-filled his tarts. Priya is dinged for her bad decoration and for boiling her lemon-raspberry custard, but it at least tastes good. Alice loses points for using orange extract in her bake, as if she didn\u2019t just watch Phil receive the same criticism the week before. Come on! Steph does what David does, but in the opposite way, going for intense flavor over intense decoration. Paul and Prue enthusiastically approve. As for Michelle, her tarts look neat, but lack blueberry flavor because as Prue points out, \u201cblueberries don\u2019t have much flavor.\u201d She\u2019s not wrong. Henry makes a passable custard, but there\u2019s not much of it to eat because his pastry is too thick; and Helena overdoes it with the lavender, resulting in a bake that tastes \u201csoapy.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the producers save Rosie\u2019s judgement for last. After all, they\u2019ve been promoting her tart drop on national television for an entire week. The criticism is pretty harsh \u2014 Paul and Prue say her custard looks \u201csad\u201d and her shortcrust is \u201cdamp\u201d \u2014 but they admit that it tastes good. Our stoic kween responds, \u201cFair enough.\u201d\n\nNext we\u2019re onto the Technical and after last week\u2019s disastrous Maids of Honor challenge, the bakers are understandably on edge. Prue does absolutely nothing to set them at ease because this week she wants the bakers to make beignet souffl\u00e9s, essentially deep-fried choux pastry, filled with jam, and served with sabayon, a wine-infused custard. I\u2019m gonna cut to the chase and let you know that a lot of the bakers royally fuck this one up, but it\u2019s not Prue\u2019s fault. Because how can you expect to win the Great British Baking Show without knowing how to make a choux pastry off the top of your head? It\u2019s a foundational recipe, people! Michael, who comes in 8th just behind David and his raw choux, has a meltdown over not knowing how to make one at all. But I\u2019m short on sympathy for him because Henry, Priya, and Helena \u2014 who claims first place in a Technical for the first time after consistently missing the mark\u2014 all figure it out. Here\u2019s hoping that after this week, every single baker went home and read the tartine book cover to cover.\n\nAnyway! Onto the Showstopper, which is centered on cocktail-themed cakes because Prohibition. And since every decent baker should know how to make a decent cake, if not a choux pastry, this challenge is more about great decor and flavor combinations than technical prowess. Plus, who doesn\u2019t like to watch people make cakes?!\n\nThere is one drawback to this themed-cocktail challenge, however: No fewer than four of the bakers decide to make cakes based on the pi\u00f1a colada, a cocktail that was not invented in the 1920s. There are no French 75s, or Sidecars, or Gin Fizzes, or Bee\u2019s Knees, or Corpse Revivers, or any other cocktails that come up when you Google \u201c1920s cocktails.\u201d So, Alice, Michelle, Priya, and Steph are fighting to see which of them can be the most original unoriginal baker.\n\nDavid, who looks like he\u2019s never failed to live up to a theme, decides he\u2019ll make an amaretto sour cake with lemon sponge and aromatic bitters buttercream frosting. Helena is riding high after coming first in the Technical and gleefully describes her Vampire\u2019s Kiss red velvet cake with vodka and cream cheese frosting. Prue swats a fly away from her face and Helena says it landed on her because she\u2019s dead and I\u2019ve never loved a reality TV contestant more.\n\nHenry and Rosie both make White Russian cakes with the former going hard on the coffee (coffee sponge, coffee liqueur, coffee buttercream) and the latter deciding that what the judges really want right now is a mirror glaze with vodka meringue on top and gold royal icing. Yeah, sure. Rounding out the \u201cNot Pina Colada\u201d cakes is Michael, whose Bramble cake with blackberry liqueur will hopefully make up for his tragic showing in the Technical.\n\nNow, this being a cake challenge, it was always unlikely that there would be any major mishaps. It\u2019s just cake! And yet. David\u2019s layers of beautifully decorated cake sink into one another, but he gets away with it because like I said, it\u2019s beautiful and it tastes good even if the buttercream is \u201cgrainy\u201d in Paul\u2019s opinion. Michael\u2019s Bramble Cake also comes across well and Rosie and Henry both manage to make very good White Russian cakes because coffee. The judges barely comment on how messy Rosie\u2019s cake looks. And why should they? Getting a reaction out of her is like squeezing blood from a stone. Helena, the last maker of a non-Pi\u00f1a cake, is immediately dinged for her sloppy icing decoration, which looked fine to me, but oh well. And for whatever reason, Paul finds the red velvet cake underneath \u201cbland,\u201d as if he\u2019s never tasted red before.\n\nOver in Pi\u00f1a Colada Land, the cakes are a mixed bag, which makes a lot of sense statistically. At the bottom is Michelle\u2019s Dancing Queen cake that she originally baked for her sister\u2019s bachelorette party. Apparently her sister didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that the cake was lacking in flavor and, in this case, over-decorated. Priya and Alice land in the middle with cakes that taste good even if they look sloppy. Priya\u2019s relieved, having made up for a poor performance in the Signature Challenge. Alice looks on wistfully, wishing desperately to return to Biscuit Week, when she was named Star Baker. But as long as Steph keeps making stellar bakes, like this week\u2019s Sour Lime Pi\u00f1a Colada Cake with Swiss meringue buttercream, that dream becomes more distant. For the second week in a row, Steph wins Star Baker.\n\nIn the judging room, Paul and Prue hint that the producers have decided that it\u2019s finally time for them to decide to send two bakers home. But which two? Helena had a bad week, but came first in the Technical. Rosie did badly in the Signature and got 5th in the Technical, but perhaps she made up for it in the Showstopper. Priya has been solidly middle-of-the-pack for five weeks, but she got 2nd in the Technical. Michelle and Alice have both been Star Bakers even if they haven\u2019t done terribly well since.\n\nWell, as it turns out, being Star Baker and/or winning the Technical offers absolutely no protection. Because it\u2019s Helena and Michelle who get sent home. Michelle, I get. It\u2019s been downhill for her since week one. But Helena! The Queen of Night?! Who came first in the Technical THIS WEEK? It\u2019s a decision, I, for one, will never understand. But at the very least, the threat \u2014 and false drama \u2014 of two people going home at any time is gone now. They\u2019ve played that card and it\u2019s the kind of manufactured chaos GBBS doesn\u2019t need. That\u2019s what Desserts Week in a hot tent is for, amirite?", "description": "Still riding the high of Dairy Week, the show decides to throw another new theme into the mix.
