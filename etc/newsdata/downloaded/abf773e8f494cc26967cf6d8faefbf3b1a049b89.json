In a moment of frustration with his own performance, he lashed out at a solid object, resulting in his injury.\n\nTeam doctor Hashendra Ramjee said: \u201cA CT scan of Aiden Markram\u2019s wrist showed a fracture involving the wrist bones. The medical team has therefore ruled him out of the next Test match against India. Arrangements have been made for him to see a specialist on his return to South Africa for further management of the injury.\u201d\n\nA very disappointed Markram added: \u201cIt\u2019s sad to be going home on this note and I completely understand what I\u2019ve done wrong and take full accountability for it. It\u2019s unacceptable in a Proteas environment and to let the team down is what hurts me the most. I\u2019ve learned a lot from this and the other players I\u2019m sure, have learned from it as well. We understand in sport that emotions run high and sometimes the frustration gets the better of you as it did for me, but like I said, it\u2019s no excuse. I\u2019ve taken full responsibility for it, I have apologised to the team and hopefully I can make it up to them and the people of South Africa soon.\u201d\n\nMarkram has departed for South Africa on Thursday morning. No player has been called up as a replacement.\n\nThe third and final Test starts on Saturday. India hold an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.\n\n- Cricket SA\n\n", "description": "Proteas batsman Aiden Markram has been ruled out of the third and final Test against India after sustaining an injury to his right wrist.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8897/42350ec6771a431187e2e20defae7a83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
