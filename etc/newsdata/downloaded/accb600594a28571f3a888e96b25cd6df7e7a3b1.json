A partial deal is now being put down in writing, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday.\n\nChinese diplomats will now be required to tell the State Department in advance of any official meetings with US diplomats, local or municipal officials, and before any visits to colleges or research institutions.\n\n\"What we're trying to achieve here is just to get closer to a reciprocal situation,\" the official said, emphasising that Chinese diplomats were not being asked to get \"permission\" for their visits.\n\nThe official said he hoped the measure would prompt Beijing to open up its own country a bit more to US diplomats.\n\nThe US decision is the latest in an ongoing diplomatic tit-for-tat with China.\n\nLast week, Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Geng Shuang had accused the US of harassing Chinese scholars, students, businessmen and scientists through the denial or revocation of visas.\n\nGeng complained the US was thwarting \"normal people-to-people exchange\" and infringing on the \"safety and lawful rights and interests\" of those involved.\n\nChina's Ministry of Public Security also announced last week that it is planning to impose tighter visa restrictions on US nationals with ties to \"anti-China\" groups, including those employed, or sponsored, by US intelligence services and human rights groups.\n\nThe US and China are also at odds over intellectual property rights and human rights questions including freedom of speech.\n\nUS State Secretary Mike Pompeo has also been putting pressure on China over its treatment of Muslim Uighurs, calling it \"enormous human rights violation\".", "description": "Chinese diplomats in the US required to notify State Department before any meetings with American officials, academics.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/7e67dcce7ee54702a3e69644291a1620_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
