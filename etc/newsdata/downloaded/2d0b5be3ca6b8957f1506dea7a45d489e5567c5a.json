Six deaths have been confirmed in six states: California, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, and Oregon.\n\nThat's a smaller number of illnesses than the agency had previously stated because it has updated the way it reports cases of lung disease associated with e-cigarette use. It's now reporting confirmed and probable cases, rather than possible cases or cases under investigation.\n\nLast week, the CDC had reported that there are more than 450 possible cases of vaping-related lung disease across 33 states and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nThere are hundreds more cases under investigation around the country, according to a CNN analysis of numbers reported by state health departments this week.\n\nThe states and territory with confirmed cases are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, West Virginia and the US Virgin Islands.", "description": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated the way it reports cases of mysterious lung disease associated with e-cigarette use, narrowing the number of cases and expanding the number of states involved.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911110841-03-illinois-teen-vaping-illness-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
