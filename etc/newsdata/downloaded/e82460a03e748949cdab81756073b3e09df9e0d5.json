(Nick Wass/AP)\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Natasha Cloud tipped off the Washington Mystics\u2019 practice Monday ahead of Game 4 of the WNBA semifinals with a message yelled loud and clear.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, weight room crew!\u201d Cloud shouted across the court at Mandalay Bay Events Center, where the Mystics had taken a 92-75 beating at the hands of the Las Vegas Aces in Sunday night\u2019s Game 3. Cloud\u2019s new nickname for her team was a reference to Aces center Liz Cambage\u2019s comments on ESPN after a physical game in which the 6-foot-8 center dominated the paint and scored 28 points.\n\n\u201cIf they can't handle it,\u201d Cambage said, \u201cget in the weight room or get out of the post.\"\n\nA video of Cloud and forward Myisha Hines-Allen was posted on social media not long after with the caption \u201cWe\u2019ll show you the weight room.\u201d And with that, trash-talking became an added element to this best-of-five WNBA semifinal series that the Mystics lead 2-1. Game 4 is Tuesday, and don\u2019t be surprised if things get chippy.\n\n[Mystics left frustrated after vaunted attack is limited in blowout loss to Aces]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the petty one,\u201d Cloud said with a laugh, referring to the fact that most of her Mystics teammates don\u2019t post clap-backs on social media or spout pithy quips in front of cameras. \u201cI don\u2019t really get into the trash talk, but when it comes to protecting my teammates and having my teammates\u2019 back, I\u2019m the petty one with the loud mouth. If you see me on the court doing push-ups tomorrow \u2014 I might do that.\u201d\n\nIn terms of backing up players, the Mystics have Cloud, and the Aces have Coach Bill Laimbeer.\n\nAces\u2019 Liz Cambage on Mystics\u2019 social media reaction to her \u201cweight room\u201d comments: \u201cDa\u2014, if one sentence is going to get into people\u2019s heads like that, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m in your head and I\u2019m not even stressed about it.\u201d pic.twitter.com/KNg7hLpR7X \u2014 Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) September 23, 2019\n\nAsked Monday what he thought of Cambage\u2019s comments on ESPN \u2014 which probably referred to the Mystics\u2019 slim, 6-2 center, LaToya Sanders, who has guarded Cambage all series \u2014 Laimbeer said, \u201cI think [Cambage] is correct.\n\n\u201cI mean, she\u2019s big, she\u2019s tall, she\u2019s the strongest player on the inside in there. Why are people complaining? That\u2019s who she is. That\u2019s why we got her. \u2026 They can\u2019t guard her one-on-one. She overpowers people. Okay, that\u2019s basketball. Why would somebody complain about that?\"\n\nThe Aces\u2019 and Mystics\u2019 off-court comments only highlighted what Game 3 made apparent: This series is a clash between teams that take fundamentally opposite approaches to the game.\n\nMore from Mystics\u2019 Natasha Cloud on Aces\u2019 Liz Cambage\u2019s \u201cweight room\u201d comments: \u201cWhen it comes to protecting my teammates, I\u2019m the petty one with the loud mouth. You might see me do some push-ups on the court tomorrow. I\u2019ll take my undersized forward any day of the week.\u201d pic.twitter.com/lyWYPZJRQN \u2014 Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) September 23, 2019\n\nFourth-seeded Las Vegas had the highest defensive rating of any team in the league during the regular season and led the WNBA with an average of 38.8 rebounds. When the Aces played to their strengths Sunday, they came away with a win that was predicated on sharp, aggressive defense and an offense that started with Cambage and fellow big A\u2019ja Wilson: The Aces had 46 points in the paint to the Mystics\u2019 22.\n\nWashington, on the other hand, earned the top seed in the playoffs with a record-setting offense predicated on ball movement and three-pointers. The Mystics won Games 1 and 2 at Entertainment and Sports Arena by shooting with efficiency and making 19 three-pointers over two games.\n\nThey even approach trash talk differently.\n\nAces coach Bill Laimbeer on Liz Cambage\u2019s \u201cweight room\u201d comments about Mystics: \u201cShe\u2019s correct. She\u2019s big. She\u2019s tall. She\u2019s the biggest player on the inside. Why are people complaining? If you can\u2019t guard her one on one and she overpowers you, okay, that\u2019s basketball.\u201d pic.twitter.com/LMbUtPWWHd \u2014 Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) September 23, 2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team of personalities; there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Laimbeer said. \u201cWe have some talent in these personalities, and sometimes, it\u2019s okay. This is an emotional sport. \u2026 Yeah, we love this stuff.\u201d\n\nSaid Washington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault: \u201cThe trash talking is not going to do anybody any good, at all. It\u2019s which team plays closer to their potential. We\u2019re not all of a sudden going to become a grind-it-out, physical, half-court team to try to match them. That\u2019s not happening. They try to do some of the running with us, but they aren\u2019t going to shoot some of the threes that we do. So, who can impose their will on the game longer? Just do that. They got to this point for a reason; we got to this point for a reason. But we\u2019ve won twice on this court already [in the regular season]. Our team knows that.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics believe they were too stagnant on offense Sunday and that the way to beat the Aces\u2019 strong defense is to play their own game better \u2014 move the ball more laterally to create open shots for perimeter players and don\u2019t get hung up if the officials let physical play continue.\n\nAces\u2019 Liz Cambage on why she\u2019s often a lightning rod for opponents: \u201cProbably my personality. I\u2019m a cheeky little s\u2014-.\u201d pic.twitter.com/WievwNerfr \u2014 Ben Golliver (@BenGolliver) September 23, 2019\n\nBut Cloud also thinks her teammates will walk into Mandalay Bay on Tuesday with extra motivation to beat the Aces \u2014 and book their second straight appearance in the WNBA Finals \u2014 thanks to all the extracurricular chatter.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cAgain, we didn\u2019t hear that the first two games when Emma scored 57 points and was asked about what makes her successful. All she said was, \u2018My shots go in the basket.\u2019 That\u2019s humility. That\u2019s who we are. All that trash-talking doesn\u2019t really affect us; it just adds fuel to the fire. People forget we\u2019re up 2-1. If we play our game, we\u2019ll come out on top.\u201d\n\nAsked Monday if she too would be using the off-court talk as motivation for Game 4, Cambage said she hadn\u2019t even seen the Mystics\u2019 responses to her comments. The Aussie said she is used to extra attention from opposing teams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on social media, so I haven\u2019t even seen what they\u2019re doing, but damn. If one sentence is going to get in people\u2019s heads like that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Cambage said. \u201cI\u2019m in your head, and I\u2019m not even stressed about it.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAces look like a different team, and Mystics miss first chance to clinch spot in WNBA Finals\n\nAces\u2019 gamble on Bill Laimbeer yields an early payoff\n\nSvrluga: Elena Delle Donne, the WNBA\u2019s MVP, is right at home with the Mystics", "description": "\"When it comes to protecting my teammates and having my teammates' back, I'm the petty one with the loud mouth.
