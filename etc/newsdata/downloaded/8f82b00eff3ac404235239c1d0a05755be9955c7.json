He intercepted 54 passes, was a first-team all-pro five times in the NFL and the former American Football League, and made the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1984.\n\nHis most memorable play came in Super Bowl XI against the Vikings on Jan. 9, 1977. With the Raiders leading the game 26-7 in the fourth quarter, Mr. Brown intercepted a pass from Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton and raced for the score, with radio broadcaster Bill King providing the memorable by-by-play: \u201cHe looks and throws \u2026 intercepted by the Oakland Raiders Willie Brown at the 30, 40, 50 \u2026 He\u2019s going all the way! \u2026 Old Man Willie! \u2026 Touchdown Raiders!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Brown retired two seasons later. He was an assistant coach for the Raiders from 1979-88, was head coach at Long Beach State University in California in 1991, coached at Jordan High School in Los Angeles in 1994 and returned to the Raiders when they moved from Los Angeles back to Oakland in 1995 as director of staff development.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Brown was a regular presence around the team during that time, working with the cornerbacks and in more recent years announcing the team\u2019s picks during the annual NFL draft.\n\nWilliam Ferdie Brown was born in Yazoo City, Miss., on Dec. 2, 1940.\n\nHe played football at Grambling College (now Grambling State University) under coach Eddie Robinson and was undrafted after leaving school with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1962.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play [defensive back] in college,\u201d he told ESPN in 2013. \u201cI just knew that if you beat the hell out of the receivers coming off the line of scrimmage, that was going to affect whether they could catch the ball or not.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown, who later earned a master\u2019s from Long Beach State, was cut by the Houston Oilers in his first training camp, in 1963. He soon signed with Denver, then part of the AFL, and was named a starter midway through his rookie year, becoming an AFL all-pro in his second season.\n\nComplete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He picked off a pass from Fran Tarkenton in Super Bowl XI, then raced 75 yards for the score.", "authors": ["Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VfYptOCdliN1XKi7zoDy-Z4ehpE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WR5F2WXVDII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
