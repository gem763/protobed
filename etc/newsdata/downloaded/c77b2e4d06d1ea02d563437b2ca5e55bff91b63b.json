Argentina are a good team, though, and we have to give them respect.\u201d", "description": "Argentina's defeat to France in their Pool C opener may prove to be a mortal wound for their World Cup campaign but the Pumas are determined to put that loss behind them and will settle for nothing short of a bonus-point win over Tonga on Saturday.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434040162&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0DB", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
