In recent weeks she has emerged as the frontrunner, even beating out the usual No. 1 candidate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOlder generations are much less likely to vote for a socialist candidate, according to the poll.\n\nOnly 44 per cent of Generation X, aged 39-54, 33 per cent of Boomers, aged 55-73, and 33 per cent of the Silent Generation, those 74 and older, said they are somewhat or extremely likely to vote for a socialist.\n\nThe poll, from Victims of Communism, also indicates more respondents believe Donald Trump is a bigger threat to world peace than totalitarian, communist and corrupt leaders Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jingping and Nicolas Maduro\n\nWhen ignoring generational lines, overall Americans are more hesitant to vote for a self-declared Democratic socialist than they were last year. In this poll, 53 per cent said they are \u2018hesitant\u2019 or would \u2018never vote for a candidate who identified as socialist compared to the 47 per cent who said they same in 2018.\n\nAnother indication that millennials favor socialism over capitalism, the poll found, is that one-in-five said they believe society would be better off if all private property were abolished and it were owned and run by the government instead.\n\nTraditionally, socialist views advocate for bigger government and more government control, while capitalism lends itself to a smaller federal government, less government intervention in business and personal life and prefers the free market to take hold.\n\nSixty-one per cent of respondents to the survey said they prefer capitalism over other economic systems \u2013 the same outcome of the 2018 poll.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 2,100 U.S. residents over the age of 16, has a margin of error of 2.4 per cent.\n\nIt found that Americans find Donald Trump to be a bigger threat to world peace than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jingping and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro \u2013 all who run either a communism, totalitarian or otherwise corrupt government.\n\nThe Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation was set up in 1994 and is aiming to build a museum on the Mall in Washington D.C.\n\nIt campaigns to honor opponents of Communism and highlight what it says is the danger of its resurgence.", "description": "The majority of millennials, those born between 1981-1996, said in a poll released Monday that they would vote for a socialist candidate.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20285452-0-image-a-39_1572277789098.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
