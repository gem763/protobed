(AP Photo/Rizza Alee)\n\nA Nepali climber has reached the summit of the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains in just over six months, setting a record for a feat that took other climbers years to complete.\n\nThe climber, Nirmal Purja, 36, completed his goal early Tuesday morning when he reached the top of Shishapangma in Tibet along with a Sherpa team.\n\n\u201cMission Achieved!\u201d was the simple message he relayed in a post on social media.\n\n\u201cIt has been a grueling but humbling six months, and I hope to have proven that anything is possible with some determination, self-belief and positivity,\u201d Purja said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for Seven Summit Treks, a Nepal-based company that helped organize some of Purja\u2019s expeditions, said by phone that it was in touch with his climbing team and confirmed that he had reached the top of Shishapangma.\n\nThe attempt to be the fastest to reach the top of all the world\u2019s known mountains over 8,000 meters, or about 26,350 feet, which Purja called Project Possible, started in April, when he scaled Annapurna. He then quickly tackled the 13 remaining mountains, all of which are in the Himalayan and Karakoram ranges that stretch across China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\n\nClimbing the world\u2019s 8,000ers, as they are known, requires time in the so-called death zone, an altitude at which reduced oxygen levels make it difficult for humans to breathe effectively and where climbers can die.\n\nThe previous speed record for scaling all 14 peaks was held by Kim Chang-ho of South Korea, who completed his climbs in seven years, 10 months and six days. He narrowly broke an earlier record held by Jerzy Kukuczka of Poland, who took seven years, 11 months and 14 days.\n\nKim later died in a storm on the Mount Gurja in Nepal, and Kukuczka died in 1989 while trying to scale the south face of Lhotse in Nepal.\n\nA member of Purja\u2019s team said she was still awaiting news of a safe descent and said he would be out of contact for several hours while he made his way back down the mountain.\n\nPurja drew worldwide attention to his attempt in May, when he posted a photo of a traffic jam of climbers near the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nPurja managed to reach the top of Everest \u2014 a climb he has made several times \u2014 but it was an exceptionally deadly season on the world\u2019s tallest peak, with 11 people dying during the window of several weeks with favorable conditions for climbing. At the time, he spoke from Everest base camp about the risks associated with climbing at such high altitudes.\n\n\u201cThe mountains draw people, always have and always will,\u201d he said in a message. \u201cEverest is the highest mountain and has the highest draw. You can\u2019t blame climbers for wanting to summit. You can\u2019t blame guides for leading them.\u201d\n\nHe said an exceptionally short climbing window also limited the days that climbers could make a final push to the summit.\n\nBut he noted that some people were taking unnecessary risks and said that the number of permits, expeditions, guides and climbers needed to be better regulated.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is safety \u2014 every person on the mountain, not just your own,\u201d Purja said.\n\nThe government of Nepal is planning new restrictions on permits to climb Mount Everest in an effort to limit traffic on the mountain. Purja took part in four unplanned rescues during his attempt at the 14 climbs.\n\nHe said the idea to try to break the 14-summit record came to him in 2017 when he achieved three speed records on peaks above 8,000 meters.\n\nThat year, Purja achieved the fastest consecutive climbs of Everest, Lhotse and Makalu, in a total of five days; the fastest time from the summit of Everest to the summit of Lhotse, in 10 hours 15 minutes; and he was the first person to reach the summit of Everest twice, Lhotse once and Makalu once in a single push, taking a total of 17 days.\n\n\u201cOn completion of these I felt tired, but not completely drained,\u201d he said. \u201cThis got me thinking about my physiology and what I could achieve if I really pushed myself.\u201d\n\nHigh-altitude mountaineering can be expensive, with costs for equipment and guides costing tens of thousands of dollars. Purja said he had found it difficult early on to obtain sponsorship for his attempt, but eventually luxury British watchmaker Bremont financed his efforts.\n\nNick English, a co-founder of the watch brand, offered his \u201chuge congratulations\u201d to Purja on Tuesday.", "description": "A Nepali climber has reached the summit of the world's 14 highest mountains in just over six months, setting a record for a feat that took other climbers years to complete.The climber, Nirmal Purja, 36, completed his goal early Tuesday morning when he reached the top of Shishapangma in Tibet along", "authors": ["Megan Specia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eWP9WjJ96cTj.z6uj8UnMA--~B/aD0xMjMyO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/45363bd0-821f-11e9-a9dd-2fb4a52e28ad", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
