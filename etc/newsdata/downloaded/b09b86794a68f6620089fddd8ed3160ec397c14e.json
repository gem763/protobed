It\u2019s art and it\u2019s to be dissected and taken on in whatever individual way you wish,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018And if you\u2019re sad that the show is done and you\u2019re sad because you enjoyed watching it, then that\u2019s sad.\n\n\u2018It sucks this wasn\u2019t the perfect ending that people were hoping for, but I truly believe we would never have made everyone happy.\u2019\n\nRecently the show\u2019s director Neil Marshall says he would have done things a lot differently for the final two episodes of the concluding season.\n\nThe actress has left a legacy with the show (Picture: WireImage)\n\nIf anyone was to know anything about gruesome fights and barbaric wars, it would be Neil, who directed the pivotal episodes Blackwater and The Watchers on the Wall which had Jon Snow\u2019s (Kit Harington) first lover Ygritte (Rose Leslie) killed.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Benioff and Weiss know the show inside and out and had control since the series began.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very difficult to second guess those guys because they are geniuses and they have done such an amazing job,\u2019 the Hellboy creator exclusively told Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Inevitably, I would\u2019ve taken a different approach to directing. One of the greatest experiences I had with working on both those episodes was that they were so open to bringing my ideas, particularly about battle scenes and how battles worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would\u2019ve definitely added my strategy and knowledge to that.\u2019\n\nIt comes as chapter after chapter of the show as we know it closes in anticipation of the prequel \u2013 including the cast WhatsApp group chat.\n\nAccording to Isaac Hempstead Wright, who played Bran Stark, the infamous chat is all but gone.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s dead at the moment,\u2019 Isaac told MirrorOnline, adding that the chat was \u2018petering out.\u2019\n\nStill, maybe a revival is on the cards? We refuse to believe that it\u2019s all over.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
