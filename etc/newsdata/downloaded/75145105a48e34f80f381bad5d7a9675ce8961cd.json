Starting this week, though, Google says Google Maps users on iOS will soon be able to report road incidents as well.\n\nIn a blog post (via 9to5Google), Google says that iPhone users will be able to report those crashes, speed traps, and traffic slowdowns now too. To report an incident, you\u2019ll tap a new button under the compass in the driving navigation UI, as shown in this GIF:\n\nAnd iOS users aren\u2019t the only ones getting new reporting options \u2014 Google says that users on both platforms will be able to report construction, lane closures, disabled vehicles, and objects on the road in updates rolling out this week.\n\nOne of the best parts of Waze is that it gives a pretty accurate picture of what\u2019s happening on the roads around you so that you can have a better idea of current road conditions. Hopefully, now that both users on both major phone platforms can report what\u2019s going on, and with more detail than before, Google Maps will provide similarly useful information.", "description": "Since 2018, Google has slowly added ways to report incidents on the road like accidents, road closures, and traffic slowdowns \u2014 something made popular by Google-owned Waze \u2014 to Google Maps on Android.
