USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Houston Astros, with the music blaring and laughter permeating the clubhouse Saturday evening, still can\u2019t figure out what happened back in Houston.\n\nThey lost with Gerrit Cole. They were routed with Justin Verlander. And they got on the plane to Washington, D.C., wondering what in the world hit them.\n\nWell, whatever the virus that inflicted them, it's now out of their system, and they are back to being the biggest and baddest dudes in all of the land.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is that we got our swagger back, and we\u2019re playing good,\" Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said Saturday night, \u201cand we are dangerous when we feel like this.\"\n\nThe Washington Nationals certainly are witnesses to the Astros\u2019 turnaround. Their 2-0 lead in this World Series has disintegrated in front of them, losing back-to-back games for the first time in six weeks after the Astros\u2019 8-1 rout at Nationals Park.\n\nThe World Series is now tied at 2-apiece, with the visiting team winning all four games for the first time since 1996.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nWhere was this team at the start of the World Series?\n\nAstros infielders celebrate after Yuli Gurriel made a diving play to end a threat in the sixth. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u2019\u2019 Correa said, \u201cit was weird. I felt like Games 1 and 2 almost felt like regular-season games for some reason. We didn\u2019t have our swagger. We didn\u2019t have our flow. We didn\u2019t have our hunger, wanting it so that you want to go out there and fight for it.\"\n\nThey decided to have a talk about it.\n\nVerlander and Jose Altuve reminded the team after their 12-3 loss in Game 2 that this still was the same team that won 107 games in the regular-season. It was still the same team that knocked off the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALDS, outlasted the New Yankees in the ALCS.\n\n\u201cWe said, 'We got to get our swagger back,\u2019\" Correa said. \u201cWe got to go out there and get hits. And get hyped. Get pumped. We\u2019ve got to go out there and play the baseball that we were playing all year and were successful doing.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be out there and acting like it was normal. It\u2019s the World Series. It doesn\u2019t get any better. It\u2019s the last series of the season, let\u2019s give it our all.\"\n\nSWAG: 'That's what you get' \u2013 Bregman delivers grand slam\n\nWHO? Thanks to rookie, Astros back in World Series\n\nWell, mission accomplished, with the Astros outscoring the Nats 12-2 the last two nights, pounding out 24 hits, seven for extra bases, with three homers.\n\n\u201cWe flipped the script,\" Astros outfielder Josh Reddick said. \u201cI think for the first time this postseason, the Houston Astros showed what we can really do with this lineup.\"\n\nNow, after playing eight months, 324 regular-season games and 29 postseason games between them, the entire season comes down to a best-of-three series.\n\nThe Astros have their Cy Young candidates lined up with Gerrit Cole going Sunday in Game 5 at Nationals Park and Justin Verlander in Game 6 at Minute Maid Park in Houston.\n\nAnd the Nats have their co-aces lined up with Max Scherzer in Game 5 and Stephen Strasburg in Game 6.\n\n\u201cThey won Round 1,\" Correa said. \u201cRound 2 is the most important.\"\n\nIndeed, Cole and Verlander were out-pitched by Scherzer and Strasburg in Games 1 and 2. It was the first time all season they lost back-to-back starts at home, sending shock waves throughout Houston.\n\nThe odds of it happening again?\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t happening,\" Reddick said. \u201cGerrit isn\u2019t\u2019 going to lose two in a row. He doesn\u2019t do that. We expect him to do great things, and JV (Justin Verlander) to be JV when we get home.\"\n\nSo, it\u2019s OK to go ahead and schedule that second World Series parade in three years in downtown Houston, considering it\u2019s almost inconceivable Cole and Verlander can lose again?\n\n\u201cYou can never say that,\" Correa said. \u201cIt\u2019s baseball. Anything can happen. But Gerrit is one of the, if not the most, dominant pitchers in the game right now. When he\u2019s on the mound, you feel confident on the field, and that\u2019s not going to change because he lost one game in the last four months.\"\n\nWell, to be technical, it\u2019s five months. He lost a start for the first time since May 22 after going 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA in his previous 25 starts.\n\n\u201cAnybody,\" Correa said, \u201ccan have a bad day.\"\n\nBut for Cole to lose two games in a row?\n\nImpossible right?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to throw a jinx out there like that,\" said Astros reliever Will Harris, who once again worked his magic, preserving their early lead and now retiring 27 of the 32 batters he has faced this postseason.\n\nStill, this is different lineup now.\n\nAstros catcher Robinson Chirinos became the first catcher to hit homers in consecutive days since Ted Simmons in 1982, and struggling MVP candidate Alex Bregman is back. Bregman came into the game with four hits in 31 at-bats since the ALDS.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see Bregman struggle too often,\" Correa said, \u201cso when he does, it feels like he\u2019s in an 0-for-50 slump. Guys like him and Altuve don\u2019t struggle too long, but when they do, it seems like it\u2019s forever.\"\n\nThe Nats found out the hard way, watching him hit a seventh-inning grand slam that broke open the game, ending his night by going three for five with five RBI.\n\n\u201cYou know Bregman, he was pissed off,\" Correa said. \u201cThat intentional walk (in Game 3) set him on fire. You do that to Breg, and he\u2019s going to come back the next day and be A-Breg.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s born for this. He\u2019s born for big moments.\"\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of noise around losing the first two games,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, \u201cand rightfully so because the Nats had outplayed us. I think we turned it around.\n\n\u201cBut our mojo, our vibe, our approach, our banter in the clubhouse ... our confidence level is at a pretty good level.\"\n\nYessir, the boys that make their home deep in the heart of Texas may have wandered off for a while, but they are back.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "The Astros may have lost the first two games of the World Series, but they got their swagger back heading into Game 5 with the series tied 2-2.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
