Such as your shambolic coaching and persistent ill-discipline on the pitch which for decades now has seen France underperform.\n\nWorld Cup referee Jaco Peyper posed with Wales supporters for a photo in which he appeared to mimic the foul play of France star Sebastien Vahaamahina following the quarter-final\n\nVahaamahina was shown a red card by Jaco Peyper for an elbow on Wales' Aaron Wainwright\n\nCome on guys, get your sense of humour back. The match was done and Vahaamahina's red card was one of the more obvious dismissals of the 21st century!\n\nThere is zero controversy or intrigue here, the French lock got precisely what he deserved. Every ref in the world would have sent him packing. And even then France should probably have won but they continued to blow their points scoring opportunities.\n\nJaco Peyper was out relaxing after a huge game and the day a referee can not enjoy a beer and a joke with either the players or fans is the day rugby has lost its way.\n\nVahaamahina smashes his elbow into the face of Wainwright (left) during the quarter-final\n\nThe way rugby as a sport navigates its way through various controversies is with a well honed, ironic sense of humour and with a general, beery coming together after the game. Long may it last.\n\nKnowing French rugby fans very well, as I do, had it been them Jaco bumped into, I'm sure they would have put aside their disappointment and also enjoyed a joke - who knows, they might even have posed for the identical picture.\n\nThe idiotic Vahaamahina would have been the butt of their humour as well. So leave Jaco alone.\n\nHe's a very decent referee who gets out there and meets the fans and mixes with the players.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Referees are not immune from criticism but I support Jaco Peyper 100 per cent in having a little fun with Welsh supporters on Sunday night.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/22/19968302-0-image-a-44_1571693925259.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
