He commits his wrongs in the full glare of publicity. Bribes to Trump are not delivered by shadowy men in underground garages. They are collected right on Pennsylvania Avenue, in a garish hotel with Trump\u2019s name right on the door. Trump does not stealthily embezzle Republican donations. The party simply books its events in his premises, every misappropriated dollar counted and disclosed. When Trump invited Russia to hack his opponent and deliver her e-mails to him, he did it on live television.\n\nTrump takes advantage of a human tendency to think: If he\u2019s not ashamed, maybe he did nothing wrong. Normal people are taken aback by pathological people, and Trump is the most pathological president in American history.\n\nBut we\u2019re at the breaking point. The Ukraine story confirms that Trump will do anything. Anything. Everything.\n\nHe relies on everybody around him being too dazed, too psychologically weak, to resist him and uphold even the most basic legality and decency. So far, he\u2019s gambled right. It\u2019s time\u2014way past time\u2014to prove him wrong.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Frum", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Trumps-Ukraine-Scandal-Shows-He-Will-Do-Anything"], "top_image": ""}
