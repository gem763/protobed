I think that we\u2019ll have information that will end up going to the Judiciary Committee in a good period of time. We are moving as well as we possibly can. I don\u2019t care what Mitch McConnell is trying to do.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt is going to catch up with him,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is business that someone is speculating about the fact that he\u2019s going to try and basically whitewash it and that really do a real investigation it is not going to work. It is not going to work. The American people want to have the Senate do what the Constitution says they must do a hold a trial. They are acting as the jury, should be acting as the jury. We\u2019ll have information to put before them and they better not try to sweep it under the rug.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "Sunday on MSNBC, Rep.
