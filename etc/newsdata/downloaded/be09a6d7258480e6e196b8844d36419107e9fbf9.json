Mr Herbert says that the school reported him as missing while he was trying to get back inside.\n\n\u201cThey throw this kid out on the street in Englewood, and they leave him there, and to make matters worse, they called the police and they reported that there\u2019s a missing child,\u201d he told CBS Chicago.\n\nMr Herbert thinks the ordeal was the school punishing the boy for speaking up about being bullied.\n\nHe also said that school officials also lied to the boy\u2019s parents, saying that he\u2019d been physically fighting with other children. Mr Herbert says these fights did not occur.\n\nThe boy's grandmother told CBS Chicago that the school\u2019s counsellor and principal called her the day her grandson was left out in the cold, but said that he had run out of the school on his own.\n\nMs Pinkson has filed a federal lawsuit against the Chicago Board of Education, as well as the school\u2019s principal, counsellor, and security guard. The lawsuit accuses them of excessive force, unreasonable seizure, intentional infliction of emotional distress, creating a hostile educational environment, among other charges.\n\nEmily Bolton, a spokesperson for Chicago Public Schools, called the allegations \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d, but did not comment further on the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to holding accountable any adult whose actions could have endangered a student,\u201d she said in a statement.", "description": "A woman is suing school bosses in\u00a0Chicago after her nine-year-old son was left outside in the cold without a coat.
