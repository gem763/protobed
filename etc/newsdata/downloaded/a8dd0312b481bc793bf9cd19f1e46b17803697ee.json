Maybe you\u2019re just sick of giving your money to the makers of an addictive product. Either way, let\u2019s look at what it takes to quit vaping.\n\nMake a plan\n\nYou can chuck your vape in the trash in a fit of rage, but experts in quitting say that things tend to go better when you give the process some thought, and set a date (soon!) to quit.\n\nIt helps to know why you\u2019re quitting. Take some time to think and maybe journal about it. Later on, you\u2019ll be tempted to start again, because what good is quitting anyway if it makes you miserable? Have an answer ready to go. Better yet, make a list of your best reasons to quit and post it somewhere you\u2019ll see often, like your phone\u2019s lock screen.\n\nKnow your triggers\n\nAnticipate cravings by knowing when you normally turn to your vape pen, and planning what you\u2019ll do instead. This tool can help you make a plan based on when and where you tend to vape (or smoke), and what kind of cravings you tend to have. For example, if you tend to vape when you get bored, make a list of little tasks or errands you can do instead. If you do it to relax, figure out other ways to treat yourself.\n\nFigure out who will help you\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. While there are more resources for quitting smoking than quitting vaping, you still have plenty of options for speaking with professionals, with support groups, and for getting support from your friends and family.\n\nTell the people in your life that you\u2019re trying to quit, and let them know how they can support you. Do you want tough love? Someone to celebrate milestones with you? Someone you can text for distraction whenever cravings hit? Ask for their help, and thank them for being there for you.\n\nNicotine is addictive, so if you\u2019re having trouble quitting, it may be helpful to seek medical help. Nicotine replacement therapy, better known for its role in quitting smoking, includes patches, gum, and inhalers that provide nicotine.\n\nThey allow you to wean yourself off the chemical even after you\u2019ve quit. Nicotine inhalers require a prescription; gums and patches are available with or without a prescription. There are also prescription drugs that block some of the effects of nicotine to make it easier to quit.\n\nEditor's Note: While vapes containing nicotine are heavily regulated in Australia, there are still ways to obtain them. If you or someone you know are using vapes containing nicotine, there are still ways to quit. When in doubt, see a healthcare professional.\n\nThe bottom line is that quitting may be hard, but it\u2019s possible, and there are people out there \u2014 from your friends to your doctor to organisations and apps that want to make it easier for you. Good luck. We believe in you.", "description": "Maybe you\u2019re spooked by the outbreak of respiratory illness linked to vaping.
