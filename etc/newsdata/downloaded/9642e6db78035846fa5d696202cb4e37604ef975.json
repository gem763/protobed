His scar opened a bit, and that means we are now taking it easy with him,\u201d Valverde told a news conference.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on the road to recovery. I don\u2019t want to put any expectation on it, but it\u2019ll be difficult for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe fact he isn\u2019t playing is important for us. I can\u2019t deny he\u2019s a key man.\u201d\n\nWhile Valverde will also be without Ousmane Dembele, Luis Suarez has returned to full training and is likely to earn a recall in attack alongside Antoine Griezmann.\n\nSaturday game will be Albert Celades\u2019s first game as Valencia coach following Marcelino\u2019s sacking on Wednesday.", "description": "Lionel Messi will miss Barcelona's La Liga showdown with Valencia on Saturday and is also a doubt for Tuesday\u2019s Champions League trip to Dortmund as he has yet to recover from the calf injury he picked up in August, coach Ernesto Valverde said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429519236&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1Z7", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
