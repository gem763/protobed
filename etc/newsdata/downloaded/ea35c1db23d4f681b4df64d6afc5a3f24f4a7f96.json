We have to play as a team but sometimes goals come from those moments of magic that makes you go from 2-1 down to 3-2 up. It's important for us as a club to know we have these different resources.\"\n\nArsenal's win was far from deserved on the balance of play, with Vitoria \u2013 who took an early lead through former ex-Tottenham youngster Marcus Edwards \u2013 having had a host of chances\n\nEdwards' opener was cancelled out by Gabriel Martinelli, who has now scored four goals from three starts across all competitions this term.\n\n\"It's really important for his confidence and the team to keep pushing,\" Bellerin added when asked to comment on Martinelli's display.\n\n\"It's not just about his confidence but also about his fight, the spirit he brings to the team. He's very young, he's got a lot to learn but everything that he's doing is positive, he's helping the team, helping himself and everyone is happy he keeps scoring.\"\n\nBruno Duarte restored Vitoria's lead following Martinelli's equaliser and, until Pepe stepped into the fray, Arsenal looked set to be heading to a humiliating defeat, but Bellerin believes the manner of their victory can give the Gunners confidence.\n\n\"To be able to win games all in different ways is great,\" he said.\n\n\"The last match in the Europa League it was a 4-0 win, now towards the end we were still 2-0 down so I think it's very important for the confidence of the team to see that we can win every single game, whether things are against us or in our favour.\"", "description": "Nicolas Pepe had endured a difficult start to his Arsenal career, but Hector Bellerin never doubted his team-mate's quality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yjlnlAsPhMfh7JapCFdpjw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/c30daa0e7bec20916ba270341b8a963d", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
