Trump\u2019s unrelenting barrage has spurred worries from Democrats that congressional Republicans might try to reveal that person\u2019s identity \u2014 conceivably endangering his or her safety \u2014 at the behest of the president.\n\nSchiff (D-Calif.) said the whistleblower\u2019s testimony might not be needed given that a rough transcript of the call with Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a \u201cfavor\u201d \u2014 the centerpiece of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u2014 is public. In addition, lawmakers have a collected a tranche of damning text messages and witness testimony related to the scandal in the past two weeks.\n\n\u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected. Indeed, now there\u2019s more than one whistleblower, that they are protected,\u201d Schiff said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201c on Sunday.\n\nA second whistleblower, reportedly with direct knowledge of the call, is being represented by the same legal team as the first official, but it\u2019s unclear what information, if any, that person has provided House investigators.\n\n\u201cWe do want to make sure that we identify other evidence that is pertinent to the [investigation] \u2014 the withholding of the military support, the effort to cover this up by hiding this in a classified computer system,\u201d Schiff continued. \u201cIt may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity to do that.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are entering week four of their impeachment inquiry as they investigate efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and his son Hunter to help Trump\u2019s reelection. At the heart of the investigation is whether Trump withheld military aid and a much sought after White House meeting requested by the newly elected Zelensky in a bid to force Ukraine to investigate the Biden family.\n\nHunter Biden, whose role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company is at the center of Trump\u2019s unfounded allegations of corruption, announced Sunday he was stepping down from the board of a Chinese equity firm. He also said he wouldn\u2019t work for foreign-owned businesses if his father wins the presidency in 2020.\n\nSeveral Republicans, meanwhile, refused to answer questions Sunday about whether it were acceptable for Trump to solicit foreign assistance for political gain, instead attacking the former vice president and House Democrats.\n\n\u201cHe expresses whatever's on his mind. And people can take that and twist it any way they want to,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201c \u201cBut the new precedent for impeachment is that we don't like this president that just got elected, so we're going to spend all four years trying to impeach him.\u201d\n\nHost Jake Tapper circled back to the subject, but Cramer\u2019s answers remained basically the same.\n\nRep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) also dodged the question during an appearance on ABC. Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) made headlines last week for repeatedly refusing to answer similar questions.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) responded \"of course not\" when asked by CBS' Margaret Brennan whether it was appropriate for Trump to ask China to investigate Biden's family.\n\n\"Elections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it's not the business of foreign countries, any foreign countries, to be interfering in our elections,\" Cruz added, without mentioning Trump by name.\n\nRepublicans have generally been reluctant to answer questions about whether it is proper for Trump to solicit foreign assistance, instead attacking House Democrats over how they\u2019re conducting the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere should be a process, but instead what Adam Schiff wants is to get United States of America drunk on his favorite cocktail,\u201d Zeldin said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201c \u201cThere's three ingredients: One is cherry-picking leaks, second is withholding facts, and three is just outright lying.\u201d", "description": "House Intelligence  Chairman Adam Schiff indicated Sunday that the whistleblower at the heart of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry against  President Donald Trump might not testify over concerns about the person\u2019s safety.
