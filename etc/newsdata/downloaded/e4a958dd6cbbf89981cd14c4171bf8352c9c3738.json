Rodney March II, 28, is being held on a $100,000 cash bond.\n\nMarch left a loaded .40 caliber Glock within reach of the boy and the child, who shared his father's name, was able to get the gun and shoot himself in the head, police said in a statement to ABC News.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen it is tragic any time we lose somebody in any manner. Certainly more tragic when we lose somebody to gunfire. And it is certainly beyond the pale and heartbreaking when we lose a child anywhere in the communities we live in,\u201d St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said during a press conference on Thursday.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\n\u201cSo this is heartbreaking. It\u2019s heartbreaking for the family, for those involved and I will tell you, that it\u2019s also heartbreaking for the police officers who are involved in this,\u201d Belmar said at the press conference.\n\nThe incident happened at the boy's home and he was then driven to the hospital by his mother. While en route, the mother flagged down police for help.\n\nCounty police said they quickly began to administer medical assistance to the boy and then moved him into one of their vehicles before rushing him to a local hospital. While one officer was driving, the department said the other officer tried to administer life-saving treatment to the child. The child was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nThe toddler was not the only child to be shot to death in the St. Louis metro area on Thursday. Authorities said 13-year-old Clifford Swan III was killed Thursday night. Police have arrested an 18-year-old man suspected in the killing, but have not released the suspect's name.", "description": "At least 22 children have died of gunshot wounds in St. Louis County this year.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/police-01-as-gty-190813_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
