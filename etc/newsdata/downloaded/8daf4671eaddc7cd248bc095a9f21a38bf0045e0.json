And Domenech, whose father Douglas served in the George W. Bush administration (and helped land his son a job in it), was not only fired from the Washington Post for plagiarism, but recently unleashed a bizarre homophobic rant against Seth Meyers for the cardinal sin of challenging his wife Meghan McCain on her distortions regarding Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN.).\n\nAnyway, Maher, who\u2019s welcomed everyone from performance artist Milo Yiannopoulos to Ben Shapiro onto his popular HBO program, had Domenech on Real Time tonight.\n\nBill Maher Brands Rudy Giuliani \u2018America\u2019s Traitor\u2019 Over Trump-Ukraine Whistleblower Scandal\n\nBill Maher Gets Played By Conservative Troll Ben Shapiro\n\nAnd it went about as expected.\n\nDomenech was on the panel portion of the program and, sporting a shiny suit, kicked things off with a strange argument regarding the potential impeachment of President Trump.\n\n\u201cFirst off, you can impeach for anything. You can impeach because you don\u2019t like his hair. The Republicans could\u2019ve impeached Barack Obama because they didn\u2019t like his tan suit,\u201d Domenech puzzlingly claimed, adding that the Democrats run \u201ca real risk\u201d if the impeachment process goes into an election year.\n\nMaher didn\u2019t push back\u2014leaving it to NBC News journalist/Hunter S. Thompson cosplayer John Heilemann, who brought reason back into the equation, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t impeach someone based on the color of their hair because there\u2019s no reasonable legal theory under which the color of someone\u2019s hair constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come every zany thing he does happens to be the thing that Putin would like?\u201d asked Maher, referring to Trump\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s pulling U.S. troops out of Northern Syria and abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Silence from Domenech, naturally.\n\nAt no point in the night did Maher question Domenech about, say, who funds The Federalist or his site\u2019s history of publishing offensive\u2014and at times, downright egregious\u2014material; rather, he legitimized this lie-peddler and granted him millions of new eyeballs.
