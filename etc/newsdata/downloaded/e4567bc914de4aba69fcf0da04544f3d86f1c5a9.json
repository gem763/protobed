Speaking to law firm Irwin Mitchell\u2019s new podcast, Let\u2019s Talk About It, which discusses what it\u2019s really like to live with a disability, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve met so many disabled people since London 2012 who have said, \u2018I want to get involved with sport, but when I\u2019m pushing down the street, everyone asks, why are you not on the track against Dave Weir or Jonnie Peacock or whoever?\u2019 Suddenly we got labelled the \u2018super humans\u2019, during London \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t just the Paralympians who got labelled, it was disabled people in general.\u201d\n\nColour me impressed.\n\nSport England would classify me as \u201cactive\u201d because I push myself around the park whenever the weather allows, and I engage in activity of \u201cat least moderate intensity\u201d for more than 150 minutes a week. One of the downsides of this is having to listen to people saying, \u201cOoh you\u2019ll be going to Tokyo next!\u201d when I\u2019ve picked up a bit of speed. It\u2019s almost as irritating as those who go the other way and decide they need to come up behind me and push when I\u2019m tackling a hill perfectly well by myself.\n\nWould you say, \u201cOoh you\u2019ll be at the Olympics next\u201d to a middle-aged journalist out jogging? Of course you wouldn\u2019t, any more than you\u2019d offer to carry them up a hill.\n\nAs Cockroft says, not everyone wants to be a superhuman. But there are plenty of us who like to keep active, and would welcome the chance to compete with others of a like mind.\n\nThere\u2019s been an improvement in activity levels, according to Sport England. The latest figures, which came out this week, show some 46 per cent of those with a disability or long-term health conditions were \u201cactive\u201d in the year to May 2019. Those bearing the label \u201cinactive\u201d (less than 30 minutes of moderate activity in a week) fell to 41 per cent. But compare that to the able bodied and you see that what I\u2019d call the \u201cactivity gap\u201d remains huge. Just 24.8 per cent of the population as a whole were \u201cinactive\u201d, down from 25.2 per cent while 63.2 per cent were active, up from 62.3 per cent.\n\nHow to deal with that? Cockroft urges action to help young people. She found herself excluded from school PE lessons, so the point is well made. That needs to end. But nor should adults be forgotten. The lack of opportunities for both needs to be addressed.\n\nClubs can be hard to find, even in urban areas. Those that exist aren\u2019t always welcoming. One thing I noticed during an unhappy career in wheelchair basketball is that some \u201csuper humans\u201d have a troubling tendency to push out mere humans when they\u2019re no longer capable of competing at the top level. Sports clubs, when you can even find them, often meet at inconvenient times \u2013 especially for those of us who work. Part of the reason for that is sports venues\u2019 reluctance to provide space and time for para-sport at more popular hours of the day. In other words, not just at 7am on a Sunday morning or in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cOur biggest problem is badminton,\u201d I was told by one wheelchair basketball organiser. They weren\u2019t criticising that sport so much as they were illustrating the point that sports halls are fond of putting it on because, presumably, they do well out of it, and markedly reluctant to offer the same concessions to disability sport.\n\nTo really narrow that activity gap, and sustainably, we need more opportunities to engage in sport and exercise. I could make a case for mandating sports centres, at least publicly funded ones, to set aside space for disability sport. After all, disabled people pay their council tax too. But that would require legislation, which could be controversial, and also a humane government to enact it (so not the foul excuse for one we have at the moment courtesy of Boris Johnson).\n\nBut I think, too, that those bodies that fund disability sport, and disability sporting activities, should require governing bodies, clubs, whatever, to prove they are taking action to draw people in and to keep them.\n\nStill, good on Cockroft for raising the issue and speaking up for those of us who are merely human. It might help to start a much needed conversation.\n\nThe disability activity gap needs that; it needs people to exercise their minds as well as their bodies.", "description": "We\u2019re going to be hearing a lot about \u201cthe super humans\u201d going into a Paralympic year because TV companies will briefly wake up to the fact that there are disabled people in Britain and some of them are quite good at sport.
