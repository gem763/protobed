It's a unique place to do it because not everywhere has got strong currents, big waves or tidal surges, but you get all of that in Wales.\n\n\"If you're going to put lots of machines on the seabed we need to know the impact on the seabed. It could sink or get buried in sediment.\n\n\"We're hoping to inform them through research about the seabed - what ships are there and the most stable places to do this.\"\n\nRhys Jones, head of Renewable UK Cymru, said: \"This sort of thing is incredibly important because offshore wind is clearly going to make an increasing contribution to both Wales and the UK renewable energy generating capacity over the coming decades.\n\n\"There's the potential for the development to go out into deeper water because of the increasing capabilities of the turbines themselves, so technology like this has a real part to play in the future of offshore wind development.\"", "description": "A study mapping shipwrecks off the Welsh coast is being used to develop green energy projects.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/16FF/production/_109178850_gwyntymor.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
