They had another flat start, trailing early and unable to close the gap as the mistakes piled up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near the team we can be and we\u2019re (upset) about where we\u2019re at after the first quarter like the fans are,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThe good thing is we\u2019re the ones who get to fix it and we certainly intend on doing that.\u201d\n\nOutscored 65-10 in the first half of their three losses, the Falcons didn\u2019t give themselves a decent chance in losing their second straight. Quarterback Matt Ryan had another early turnover, fumbling on a sack by Jurrell Casey late in the first quarter to set up a Tennessee field goal and put Atlanta in a 17-7 hole.\n\nThe miscue dropped Atlanta to minus-5 in turnover differential this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s been a big point of emphasis. That was a good play by them on the turnover today. It happens sometimes in the pocket. I felt like I had two hands on it trying to move and (he) just swiped it. I\u2019ve got to find a way to clean that up. Go down quicker or get it out quicker.\u201d\n\nNot much went right for the offense. Running back Devonta Freeman gained 28 yards on 12 carries. The Falcons whiffed on their last three fourth-down chances.\n\nThe defense was embarrassed with cornerback Desmond Trufant getting burned on Marcus Mariota\u2019s first two touchdown passes. The Falcons were in zone coverage when A.J. Brown turned Trufant around in the right flats on his 55-yard catch. Trufant never looked back in a 1-on-1 matchup on Brown\u2019s 11-yard catch in the right corner of the end zone.\n\nCornerback Isaiah Oliver was out of position when Corey Davis caught a pass along the left sideline and scored a 23-yard TD to make it 24-7 in the second.\n\nSpecial teams took a hit when Matt Bryant, usually automatic from 32 yards, hit the left upright near the end of the second quarter. The Falcons jogged toward the locker room at halftime to heavy boos from the home crowd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing poorly, you\u2019re not giving them much to cheer about. You get it. We want to give them something to get loud about. To make those plays and get this place rocking, we didn\u2019t do that today. We\u2019ve got to find a way to make plays to get the energy in the building going.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons announced that 72,108 tickets were distributed, but Mercedes-Benz Stadium didn\u2019t look half full at any point during the game.\n\nFans who stayed away didn\u2019t miss much.\n\nRight guard Jamon Brown, starting his third straight game after Chris Lindstrom went on injured reserve, left with a head injury in the first quarter. Wes Schweitzer took his place, then moved to center in the third when Pro Bowl center Alex Mack left with an elbow injury. Mack returned one series later, but it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe offense ended another fruitless drive with Ryan getting sacked for the fifth time.\n\nThe Falcons have lost six straight and 12 of their past 13 games to AFC opponents. Quinn, in his fifth year as head coach, dropped to 6-13 against the AFC.\n\nAtlanta visits Houston next week.\n\n\u201cWe can practice as good as we want to,\u201d defensive tackle Grady Jarrett said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win the game. That\u2019s the business that we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve got to put a good product on the field. We\u2019ve got to find a way to get some wins. It\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re coming out on the wrong end of it in some games, but I feel like still have a lot ahead of us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Dan Quinn doesn't dispute the Atlanta Falcons had a sloppy first quarter of the season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "George Henry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/titans_falcons_football_01577_c0-125-2989-1867_s1770x1032.jpg?cc20d0514d5060f5b0528ea695cbfb7f3ff4dfd3", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
