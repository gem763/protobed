Here are five popular theories:\n\nNational unity government\n\nPolitical foes Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz could join forces to make a unity government. Gantz, however, has said he will not sit in a government with Netanyahu due to the corruption allegations. Also, it is not clear who would be prime minister.\n\nNetanyahu ousted by his own party\n\nThis is the dream scenario for Gantz, whereby the ruling Likud party sacrifices Netanyahu and joins the retired military general in government under a new leader.\n\nArab alliance recommends Gantz\n\nThe Joint List alliance of Arab parties looks likely to be the third-largest bloc in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset. They abhor Gantz\u2019s nationalist politics but could back him as a strategy to topple Netanyahu, who ran an especially anti-Arab campaign.\n\nNetanyahu pulls rabbit from hat\n\nNetanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, has made it out of a lot of tight corners. He may still scrape together a majority with some sort of deal to lure smaller parties.\n\nRepeat repeat elections\n\nNeither party is able to forge a majority coalition government, and in several weeks, a third election is called. Everything is reset for a January poll that could be just as inconclusive.", "description": "Five possible scenarios for rivals Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Raja Shehadeh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c8efb45880596d1dc336c785465625f233b650/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c3d7d04a2fa3cfdc53b8f57f387a8cd", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
