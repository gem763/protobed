Flooding is becoming more frequent. The costs of managing flooding and coastal change are increasing. Depending on where you live, you may be blissfully unaware, but the impacts of global warming are creating a new normal right here, right now.\n\nThis week\u2019s stark warning by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about the growing risk of extreme sea-level events makes it clear: Business as usual is no longer a credible response. But how do we ensure our nation responds to the climate threat of rising seas and increased flood risk?\n\nThere is no single answer, but we need bold ideas to inspire innovation beyond what people think is possible. We also need an acceptance of the realities we face.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The costs of making our homes, businesses and infrastructure more resilient to a changing climate would be far smaller than the considerable damage that flooding and coastal change could cause in the future.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In the UK, we need to plan for at least a one-metre rise in sea level by 2100, according to the latest UK climate projections. And in all future climate scenarios, we will experience a continued rise in sea level well into the next century.\n\nAnd so, at the same time as pursuing things like the government\u2019s admirable commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, we must improve our resilience to the consequences that are already embedded in our future.\n\nIn other words, we can\u2019t prevent all flooding and coastal change. But we can manage it better than our current approach, which is shaped by flood events in the past.\n\nInstead, we need to support communities to better plan and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 adapt to future flooding and coastal change.\n\nWe are used to flood defences focused on protection in the UK, but the Environment Agency\u2019s latest proposed strategy seeks to move us on to one of protection plus resilience. We have a world-class track record of delivering high-quality flood and coastal defences, but we cannot build our way out of future climate risks in many places.\n\nThe UK\u2019s toolkit for achieving climate-resilient places needs to be broader. We need to steer development to the lowest flood-risk areas and work with natural processes, for example, to slow the flow of floodwaters.\n\nWe have to get better at responding to flood and coastal incidents \u2013 such as those we\u2019ve seen this week \u2013 through timely and effective forecasting and warning, as well as getting people back to \u201cnormal\u201d as quickly as possible by clearing up or building back better after a flood.\n\nAnd we need a funding programme that will enable efficient planning and delivery of work to address the risks from all sources of flooding.\n\nAs the chairs of our respective bodies, we are at the front line of making the UK \u201cclimate-proof\u201d. We recognise this needs bold and transformative action if we\u2019re to do our part in becoming a climate-resilient nation. The government\u2019s National Infrastructure Strategy must demonstrate its commitment to precisely that approach.\n\nOur nation needs a common goal if we are to be better prepared for future flooding and coastal change. A nationwide flood resilience standard is the way to achieve this.\n\nEmma Howard Boyd is chair of the Environment Agency.
