This is an interesting question because I\u2019ve been a console gamer for decades and used to love the hype surrounding new launches, but in January this year I got a graphics card, turning my PC into a budget gaming system (which I wrote a feature about and I now find myself caring less about consoles in general and more about the PC enthusiast scene.\n\nApart from possibly the Switch (or anything else in the future that has that Nintendo uniqueness), I can\u2019t really see myself buying a Microsoft or Sony console again, even for exclusive games.\n\nSure, PC hardware can be a lot more expensive and you cannot trade in games, as the vast majority of them are now digital-only, but generally speaking anything a console can do a PC does better. I find playing shooters with a mouse far better than a controller and with consoles you are also dealing with cut down or slightly older tech, even when just released.\n\nI know this is done for cost measures but by the time PlayStation 5/Xbox Two launches, the chip makers will have released newer processors and the graphics card makers new newer generation cards. These are likely to be more expensive than the whole consoles themselves, but the performance will probably be immense in comparison, especially the high-end stuff.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this to put consoles down as, of course, they\u2019re great if you don\u2019t want to delve too much into the techy side of things and you just want something to boot up and work without a fuss, but there is nothing like putting together your own system and admiring your build or even other peoples\u2019.\n\nFrom running high refresh rate ultra-wide monitors, to using unique cases with tempered glass side panels, to RGB fans, RAM and whatnot, to custom loop liquid cooling solutions, to incredible looking (and pricey) graphics cards, I didn\u2019t know you could turn something as boring as a PC into a work of art!\n\nPsillyPseudonym", "description": "The Wednesday Inbox is very impressed by The Witcher 3 on Switch, as one reader forces The Guardian to change their story about loot boxes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nyebillederfra_1188914b_1571783558.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
