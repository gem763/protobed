McGlockton came out of the store and pushed Drejka to the ground.\n\nDrejka told detectives he opened fire after McGlockton shoved him to the ground and took a step toward him, but security video showed the victim was actually stepping away from him.\n\nPinellas County Judge Joseph Bulone said Drejka didn\u2019t show remorse for shooting McGlockton. He gave Drejka credit for three months he already served in jail.\n\nThe case sparked national debate over Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. Drejka, who didn\u2019t take the witness stand, used the law as a defense for justifiable homicide.\n\nThe law, which went into effect in Florida in 2005, allows people to use lethal force if they believe they need to do so \u201cto prevent imminent death.\u201d\n\nThe controversial law previously gained widespread attention in 2013 during trial for the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was found not guilty in the fatal shooting of Martin, resulting in protests against the verdict.\n\nSommer Brokaw contributed to this report.", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 A Florida judge on Thursday handed down a 20-year sentence to a man who fatally shot another man during a quarrel over a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
