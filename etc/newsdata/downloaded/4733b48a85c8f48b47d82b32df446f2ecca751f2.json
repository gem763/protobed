REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/Files\n\nOil prices pulled back from soaring heights touched on Monday, and the yen and Swiss franc gave up gains driven by knee-jerk safe-haven buying.\n\nThe dollar rose to its strongest since Aug. 1 against the yen, touching 108.36 yen, helped also by U.S. President Donald Trump announcing he\u2019d struck trade agreements with Tokyo.\n\nMoves were slight, however, as traders await outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday, with strong expectations for a cut in interest rates, and Bank of Japan meeting on Thursday that could result in more stimulus.\n\n\u201cThe market is in limbo between the oil price shock and the Fed meeting,\u201d said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Gain Capital in Singapore.\n\n\u201cLike any price shock, people go: \u2018What the hell has happened? What do we make of that...it didn\u2019t really spill over to currency markets like we might have expected.\u201d\n\nThe dollar index held on to Monday\u2019s gains to stand at 98.609. The euro stood a touch stronger at $1.1010, while the Swiss franc weakened slightly to $0.9919.\n\nThe Chinese yuan wavered, shedding 0.3%, as a lack of news ahead of meetings scheduled on Thursday between junior U.S. and Chinese trade officials began to sap markets\u2019 optimism about chances of a breakthrough in negotiations to end a protracted tariff war.\n\nThe biggest major mover among major currencies was the Australian dollar, which dropped 0.4% to an 11-day low, dragging the New Zealand dollar with it, after the Reserve Bank of Australia flagged an easing bias in meeting minutes.\n\n\u201cThey no longer talk about an accumulation of evidence in order to ease again, and highlight risks to the global economy,\u201d said National Australia Bank Senior FX Strategist Rodrigo Catril. \u201cIt certainly sounds a lot more dovish than before.\u201d\n\nAnother factor boosting the greenback on Tuesday was some exiting of bearish dollar bets in advance of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s two-day policy meeting.\n\nTraders widely expect the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday.\n\nBut their certainty around the timing has faltered in recent days, with the probability that the Fed will stand pat rising from about a fifth to 33% this week, while expectations for two more rounds of cuts by Christmas remain intact.\n\n\u201cMarkets are pricing in two additional rate cuts by next year but the Fed is unlikely to make such a forecast, so we could see further gain in the dollar,\u201d said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\n\nOil-producing currencies clung to Monday\u2019s gains in the wake of attacks that have cut Saudi Arabia\u2019s production in half.\n\nYemen\u2019s anti-government Houthi movement, an ally of Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday said it looked like Iran was behind the strikes but stressed he did not want to go to war. Iran has rejected the U.S. charges.\n\nThe Norwegian crown gained almost 1% Monday to trade at 9.8565 per euro while the Russian rouble hit a near seven-week high against the euro.\n\nEach held those gains in Asian trade while oil importer currencies weakened, with the South Korean won retreating further from a two-month high touched on Monday, dropping 0.4%, while the Taiwan dollar shed 0.2%.", "description": "The greenback found broad support on Tuesday amid the geo-political, and economic uncertainties cast by the attacks on Saudi oil facilities, while the Australian dollar was sharply sold after a dovish readout from the central bank.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430731271&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G06Z", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
