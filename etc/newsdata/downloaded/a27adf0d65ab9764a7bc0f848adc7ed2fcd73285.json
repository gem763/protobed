The data only concerns arrests, and does not reflect the total number of incidents involving drunk or disruptive travellers.\n\nTim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: \u201cThere is no credible reason we\u2019ve heard \u2013 other than commercial gain \u2013 why airport bars and duty free are not licensed in the same way as any pub or restaurant on the high street.\n\n\u201cLikewise, why are duty-free shops still able to sell miniature bottles of alcohol, including at the airport gate? We know miniatures are sold for one reason only \u2013 to encourage immediate consumption, including on the plane.\u201d\n\nHowever, the government-backed One Too Many campaign, which launched in 2018 with the aim of educating travellers about the repercussions of drinking too much at the airport or on a flight, said the decline in arrests on planes was a positive development.\n\nFrancois Bourienne, chair of campaign partner the UK Travel Retail Forum, said: \u201cIt is promising to see a decline in the number of arrests caused by disruptive passenger behaviour since the One Too Many campaign made its debut.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t surprised by these results as many of our campaign partner airports have reported an individual decrease in the number of disruptive passenger incidents since the campaign began, even as passenger numbers have continued to rise across the UK.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also very encouraged that the campaign has doubled in size since it began, with 20 airports now using the campaign to alert passengers to the risks and consequences of disruptive behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe findings follow a government consultation on whether licensing laws, which restrict alcohol sales before 10am, should be applied to airports.\n\nThe Home Office\u2019s \u201ccall for evidence\u201d closed in February; no recommendations have yet been made.\n\nEurope\u2019s biggest airline, Ryanair, supported the proposed changes. A spokesperson said at the time: \u201cWe continue to call for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, such as a two drink limit per passenger and no alcohol sales before 10am.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on the airports to introduce these preventative measures to curb excessive drinking and the problems it creates, rather than allowing passengers to drink to excess before their flights.\u201d\n\nJust yesterday, The Independent reported on a female passenger who was arrested by police upon arrival at Southend airport after claims she drunkenly assaulted cabin crew on an easyJet flight and allegedly attempted to open the plane door.\n\nAnother passenger said the woman had fought with her husband, who was also removed from the aircraft by police, before storming down the aisle \u201cscreaming and swearing\u201d, reported The Sun.\n\nThe passenger alleged that the woman \u201cpunched one of the crew in the face\u201d, kicked another into the emergency exit, and that travellers feared she would \u201cbash the plane door down\u201d.", "description": "The number of drunk and disruptive passengers arrested on planes at UK airports fell by 25 per cent last year, data has revealed.
