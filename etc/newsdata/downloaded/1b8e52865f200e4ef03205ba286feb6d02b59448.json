Schiff of concealing an improper tip-off from the whistleblower who started an impeachment inquiry against the president.\n\n\u201cIt shows that Schiff is a fraud,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House, asserting that the lawmaker learned some details of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint before it was even written.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandal,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019d go a step further and say [Mr. Schiff] probably helped write it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and House Democratic leaders engaged in another day of trading angry accusations, as several House committees demanded documents from the administration and questions persisted over whether the State Department would allow employees to cooperate with the probe. The president even blamed the accelerating impeachment inquiry for a nearly 500-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\n\u201cAll of this impeachment nonsense, which is going nowhere, is driving the Stock Market, and your 401K\u2019s, down,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff said Democrats have a \u201creal sense of urgency\u201d to impeach Mr. Trump, and they won\u2019t stand for delays in getting the information they are seeking from the administration. He said the more obstruction they see, the more they\u2019ll consider it an admission that the president did try to pressure the president of Ukraine in a July 25 phone call to investigate Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nMr. Schiff suggested efforts to delay witnesses or documents from reaching Congress could itself become an argument for impeachment on obstruction.\n\n\u201cThey will be strengthening the case on obstruction if they behave that way,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cOf course that was an article of impeachment against President Nixon.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said he will cooperate with requests and possible subpoenas from three House committees working on the impeachment inquiry, despite his outward contempt for the process.\n\n\u201cI alway cooperate,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis is a fraudulent crime on the American people, but we\u2019ll work together with \u2018Shifty Schiff\u2019 and [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and all of them.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the White House itself are facing subpoenas from House Democrats as the Ukraine allegations take center stage in their impeachment inquiry. Mr. Schiff\u2019s threat came a day after Mr. Pompeo accused House Democrats of attempting to bully his officials and said they might not appear before the committees.\n\nSeveral Trump-associated witnesses \u2014 including Attorney General William P. Barr, former White House counsel Don McGahn and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2014 have refused to work with House Democrats, who are pressing them for answers.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, presented congressional staffers a packet of information containing what Sen. Bob Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, called \u201clong debunked and false statements\u201d addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with \u201cThe White House\u201d listed as the address.\n\nAt least some of the information pertained to former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and the Biden family.\n\nIn a news conference at the Capitol, Mrs. Pelosi pledged a fair investigation, but both she and Mr. Schiff said they view the Ukraine phone conversation as evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIn that telephone call the president undermined our national security,\u201d she said, noting that Mr. Trump had been withholding military aid to Ukraine at the time.\n\nSaid Mr. Schiff, \u201cYou have the president using the full power of his office to try to effectively coerce a foreign leader that is completely dependent on our country \u2026 to intervene in our election to help his campaign. It\u2019s hard to imagine more corrupt conduct,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nThe still-anonymous whistleblower who initiated the investigation approached a staffer on Mr. Schiff\u2019s committee days before filing the complaint, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The paper said Mr. Schiff \u201clearned about the outlines\u201d of the complaint before it was filed.\n\nWhistleblower attorney Mark Zaid said that neither the whistleblower nor his lawyers \u201chas ever met or spoken with Congressman Schiff about this matter.\u201d\n\nBut the news that Mr. Schiff had received an early heads-up about the matter emboldened the president and his allies, who said it was evidence of partisan motives at the least and possibly a rigged impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before,\u201d the president said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big story. It\u2019s a scam.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, said Mr. Schiff \u201cjust got caught orchestrating with the whistleblower before the complaint was ever filed. Democrats have rigged this process from the start.\u201d\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called it \u201ca stunning indictment of this impeachment charade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s colluding now?\u201d she tweeted.\n\nEven before the fresh suggestion of partisan motivation by the whistleblower, the president renewed his call to uncover the identity of the government employee and to catch the \u201cspy\u201d or spies within the White House who fed information to the whistleblower.\n\nMr. Trump said the whistleblower fabricated details of the July 25 phone call \u201cor the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country has to find out who that person was, because that person\u2019s a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Finland, Sauli Niinist\u00f6.\n\nMr. Schiff said the president is trying to bully the unidentified person.\n\n\u201cThis is a blatant effort to intimate witnesses,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an incitement to violence.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Trump held a news conference with Mr. Niinist\u00f6 later in the ornate East Room of the White House, the Finnish leader offered an outsider\u2019s perspective on the political turmoil roiling Washington. He marveled at his experience this week of visiting several museums on the National Mall and receiving an invitation to a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nTurning to Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cMr. President, you have here a great democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep it going on.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump came back to his guest\u2019s observation near the end of the press conference, in which he gave another combative defense of his actions and excoriated Democrats trying to impeach him.\n\n\u201cWe are a great democracy,\u201d Mr. Trump agreed. \u201cI\u2019m airing what I\u2019m airing because we are a great democracy.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jeff Mordock, Stephen Dinan and Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
