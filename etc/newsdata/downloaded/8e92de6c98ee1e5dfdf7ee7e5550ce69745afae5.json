(Photo: Luis Gerardo Magana/ El Debate de Sinaloa/EPA-EFE)\n\nMexico's defense minister said Friday a botched attempt to arrest the son of convicted drug kingpin El Chapo had been poorly and hastily planned, triggering a deadly gun battle with armed civilians and a failure to capture the target.\n\nDefense Secretary Lu\u00eds Cresencio Sandoval said at least five attackers, a member of the National Guard, a civilian and a prisoner were killed in the melee that erupted Thursday in Culiacan, in the northwest Mexican state of Sinaloa.\n\nThe clash between the heavily armed fighters and the security police turned the city into a free-fire zone, with residents cowering in cars and supermarkets.\n\nThe security force team was attempting to arrest Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, a son of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, the convicted Sinaloa Cartel boss, after a judge in Mexico issued a warrant for his arrest and extradition to the U.S.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the defense minister said the organizers of the raid \"acted in a precipitous manner, with poor planning, and lack of foresight about the consequences of the intervention,\" according to the network Televisa.\n\nSecurity Minister Alfonso Durazo, who also attended the news conference, called the raid a \u201cfailure.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said that Guzm\u00e1n, after initially being taken into custody, was freed to defuse the deadly assault on the town.\n\nAt one point, armed civilians in trucks roared through the city\u2019s center shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHeavily armed masked fighters also set up roadblocks and attacked an army headquarters, a state police facility and a surveillance post.\n\nNumerous videos of the clashes, with fighters riding in pickup trucks and firing at will, were posted on Twitter.\n\nCuliacan, the scene of the shootout, is in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, which is home to the drug cartel by the same name. The Sinaloa drug ring was led by El Chapo, who was sentenced to life in prison in the United States in July.\n\nOvidio Guzm\u00e1n, the target of the operation, was not one of El Chapo's best-known sons \u2014 Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n, who are are known as \u201clos Chapitos,\u201d or \u201cthe little Chapos.\u201d Those sons are believed to currently run their father\u2019s cartel together with Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.\n\nAuthorities walk along a street during clashes between armed groups and Federal Forces in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, October 17, 2019 following at attempted by security forces to capture Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of drug trafficker Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera, in the Mexican city of Culiacan.

We do not want war.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, a lawyer for El Chapo\u2019s family, said \u201cOvidio is alive and free\u201d but he had no more details about what happened.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/18/el-chapos-son-gunbattle-erupts-mexican-city-during-attempted-arrest/4021367002/", "description": "Mexican security police attempting to arrest a\u00a0son of convicted drug kingpin El Chapo came under heavy fire from armed fighters Thursday, turning the city of Culiacan in northwest Mexico\u00a0into a freefire zone.", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Published A.M.
