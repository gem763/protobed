REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) has agreed to pay a 500,000 pound fine for breaches of data protection law related to the harvesting of data by consultancy Cambridge Analytica, Britain\u2019s information rights regulator said on Wednesday.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has faced questioning by U.S. and EU lawmakers over how the political consultancy obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher.\n\nThe Information Commissioner\u2019s Office issued the small but symbolic fine last year after it said data from at least 1 million British users had been among the information harvested by Cambridge Analytica and used for political purposes.\n\nOn Wednesday the ICO said that in dropping its appeal and agreeing to pay the fine, Facebook had not made an admission of liability.\n\n\u201cThe ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance,\u201d said ICO Deputy Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection.\u201d\n\nFacebook said it was pleased to have reached a settlement and the company wished it had done more to investigate the claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information app developers could access,\u201d said Harry Kinmouth, Facebook\u2019s Associate General Counsel.\n\n\u201cProtecting people\u2019s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information.\u201d", "description": "Facebook has agreed to pay a 500,000 pound fine for breaches of data protection law related to the harvesting of data by consultancy Cambridge Analytica, Britain's information rights regulator said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446496317&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0Q2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
