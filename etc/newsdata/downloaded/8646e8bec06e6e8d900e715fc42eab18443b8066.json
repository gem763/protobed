As a result, you probably won't get a chance to tidy as much. But if you're hosting guests, you'll still want your house to be looking spick and span, which is why investing in a robot vacuum can be super helpful. These little cleaning assistants zip around your home and suck up all the dirt, crumbs, and dust that accumulate on your floors, and right now, you can get our favorite affordable smart vacuum for its lowest price.\n\nOur \"best value\" pick, the Eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 30C is currently on sale on Amazon for just $200, which matches its all-time low price. This Robovac is one of the highest-quality yet reasonably priced options out there, and while it normally retails for around $300, you can save quite the chunk of change on it today and get it for $100 off its usual price.\n\nWhen we reviewed smart robot vacuums, the Eufy BoostIQ RoboVac 30C stood out in our cleaning tests, as it sucked up over 10 grams of dust, dirt, and debris in one go. We also loved how easy it was to control the vacuum with the Eufy app, which allows you to initiate cleaning cycles over WiFi no matter where you are.\n\nOur resident robot vacuum expert, Jon Chan, particularly loved the 30C's smart technology, stating: \"Imagine learning at the last second that you're having guests over. With just a tap on your phone, from anywhere in the world, you can command the Eufy 30C to make your floors presentable. The sheer peace of mind is worth the $200.\"\n\nThe holidays can be stressful enough as is, so why not lessen the headache with this deal on the 30C? Or, if you're feeling generous, you can give the gift of cleaner floors to someone else!\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
