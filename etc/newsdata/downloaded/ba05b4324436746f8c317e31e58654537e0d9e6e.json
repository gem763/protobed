Deal", "language": "en", "text": "ABC News allowed Hunter Biden to get away with the claim he did not make \u201cone cent\u201d from his company\u2019s mega-deal with a Chinese bank that is a subsidiary of the Chinese government \u2014 when its own past reporting has said just the opposite.\n\nDuring the sit-down interview, ABC\u2019s Amy Robach set up the segment about Hunter\u2019s China deal with the background on President Trump\u2019s desire to look into Hunter\u2019s shady $1.5 billion \u2014 with a \u201cB\u201d \u2014 deal with the Chinese bank (starts at around 5:03)::\n\nROBACH: Also on Trump\u2019s list of accusations against Hunter Biden: that Hunter flew on Air Force Two with his father during an official government trip to China in 2013, leveraging that connection for financial gain in an investment deal with Chinese businessman Jonathan Li.\n\nWhat Robach\u2019s question omitted is that the deal was not just with an individual businessman but with the Bank of China \u2014 a subsidiary of the Chinese government itself.\n\nShe then asks Hunter directly:\n\nROBACH: The president has repeatedly said you have received $1.5 billion, despite no experience and for no apparent reason. Obviously fact checkers have said that that is not true. HUNTER: This literally has no basis in fact in any way. ROBACH: Have you received any money from that business dealing? HUNTER: No. ROBACH: At all? HUNTER: Not one cent. ROBACH: Definitely not 1.5 billion. HUNTER: It\u2019s crazy. They feel as though they have the license to go out and say whatever they want.\n\nHunter is then allowed to trash Trump and his family as liars while Robach, who has just lauded fact checkers and their fact checking, says nothing about the fact that \u2014 and this is important \u2014 according to her own network\u2019s reporting, and Hunter\u2019s own attorney, Hunter has a ten percent stake in BHR, the company that made that mammoth $1.5 billion China deal.\n\nJust a few months ago, ABC aired an in-depth report on Hunter\u2019s shady business dealings that included this nugget (starts at about the 2:00 minute mark):\n\nThis video shows Chinese diplomats greeting Vice President Biden as he arrives in Beijing in December of 2013. Right by his side? His son Hunter. Less than two weeks later, Hunter\u2019s firm had new business, creating an investment fund in China, involving the government controlled Bank of China, with reports they hopes to raise $1.5 billion. Hunter still plays a role in the fund. His lawyer says his stake is worth about half a million dollars.\n\nWhere was Robach\u2019s followup question? Where was her oh-so-vital fact checking? Why did she let him get away with saying \u201cnot one cent\u201d when her own network reported just a few months ago that he had equity in the firm that made a massive $1.5 billion deal?\n\nObviously, Hunter is playing a semantic game with that \u201cnot one cent\u201d comment. Hunter\u2019s attorney appears to do the same in a statement he released just two days ago, on October 13, 2019:\n\nHunter neither played a role in the formation or licensure of the company, nor owned any equity in it while his father was Vice President. He served only as a member of its board of directors, which he joined based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets. It was an unpaid position. \u2026 To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors. He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest.\n\nSo Hunter hasn\u2019t \u201creceived\u201d \u201cone cent\u201d because there has been no payout to investors. There was no direct commission for that deal, which dum-dums would obviously suspect like he\u2019s a bottom-run sales rep. But here\u2019s the rub, according to no less than FactCheck.org: Hunter might not have been paid \u201cone cent\u201d yet, but he is still could be looking at an eventual payoff that hits the $20 million mark:\n\n[Hunter\u2019s lawyer George] Mesires told the New York Times that while Hunter Biden now has a 10% stake in BHR, which he acquired through a company he created named Skaneateles LLC, \u201cthere have been no distributions to the shareholders since Hunter has been an equity owner.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Biden won\u2019t eventually make millions from the deal. Steven Kaplan, who conducts research on issues in private equity, venture capital, entrepreneurial finance, corporate governance and corporate finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told us that a private equity fund with $2 billion under management will typically generate fees over its life of hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine, if not incomprehensible, that a 10% stake in those economics is worth only $420K,\u201d Kaplan told us via email. \u201cThe distinction they appear to be making is they capitalized the management company with $4.2 M even if the fund manages $2 B. The value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 M if they are managing $2 B.\u201d Kaplan pointed to two large publicly traded private equity firms for reference, both of which have a market value of about 10% of the assets under their management. Using that as a rough guide, that would put the value of Hunter Biden\u2019s share closer to $20 million, he said.\n\nBasically, it looks as though Hunter claiming not have made one cent off the China deal is like a CEO claiming he was not paid one cent to run a company because his compensation came from stocks or bars of gold or pearls or the gift of a home. But the fact is this: any deal that increases the value of the company that Hunter Biden has a stake in \u2014 and a $1.5 billion deal with a bank owned by one of the world\u2019s biggest economies does just that \u2014 is a deal where Hunter Biden has a financial interest.\n\nMaybe ABC will reveal Hunter\u2019s semantic dishonesty when the rest of the interview airs later tonight. Maybe Robach will ask him what he has \u201cearned\u201d or \u201cgained\u201d as a result of the deal, rather than \u201creceived.\u201d If not, it is a gross dereliction of duty on the network\u2019s part. And all of this comes just one day after ABC was caught presenting 2014 video from a Kentucky gun range as video of Turkish military operation against the Kurds.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
