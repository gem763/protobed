(Picture: Splash News)\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Emma revealed: \u2018This wonderful producer, David Livingstone, said, \u201cDo you want to write a screenplay, a rom-com sort of thing, because we need a new Christmas movie based on Last Christmas\u201d, and I said, \u201cNot really, because it\u2019s not my favourite Christmas song,\u201d\u2019\n\nShe added that once she had decided to get on board, she sent a \u2018good treatment\u2019 to George, and met up with him to discuss starting work on the project.\n\nAnd it was all worthwhile to arrive looking this flawless (Picture: INSTAR Images)\n\nEmma explained: \u2018He was just the loveliest guy you could imagine. [He loved] all of these themes in the movie; he was passionate about homelessness, and he had this great social conscience.\n\n\u2018I got really enthused and we started to write, and then \u2013 of course \u2013 he had that tragic early death in 2016, on Christmas Day. So we lost him, and I miss him so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I wish he was here because I know he\u2019d love it, because the film\u2019s like being hugged, and all of his music \u2014 we\u2019ve got 15 of his songs, including a new one at the end \u2014 is so cool.\n\n\u2018Heal the Pain, which is my favourite of his songs, it\u2019s like it was written for the movie. He said that.\u2019\n\nLast Christmas will be released in the UK on 15 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
