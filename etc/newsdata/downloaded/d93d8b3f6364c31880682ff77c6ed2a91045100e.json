Russian agent Maria Butina, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison earlier this year after pleading guilty to conspiring against the U.S., worked in tandem with former Russian government official Alexander Torshin to get NRA officials to Russia. From the report:\n\nSpecifically, the investigation documents the degree to which the NRA and its leadership were aware of, and cooperated with, Butina and Torshin to provide them access to the NRA and other domestic organizations. For example, NRA Board member and former NRA President David Keene and his wife, Donna Keene, played a major role in facilitating access by Butina and Torshin to the organization\u2019s leadership. Donna Keene, who was instrumental in planning an NRA delegation\u2019s 2015 travel to Russia, confirmed to participants that relationship building with Russian government officials was \u201cNRA business\u201d and that she and her husband had spent nearly a decade developing these relationships.\n\nIn a January 2015 email to David Keene, Butina bragged that Torshin\u2019s appointment to the Central Bank of Russia was \u201cthe result of a \u2018big game\u2019 in which he has a very important role,\u201d and said the new role would allow Torshin to travel to the U.S. more often to meet with NRA leadership.\n\nAfter returning from Moscow, the NRA gave the Russians free rein over the guest list for its 2016 Annual Meeting. It also provided access to other political organizations in 2015 and 2016 like the National Prayer Breakfast and the secretive right-wing Council for National Policy. pic.twitter.com/MG9Upb1ICt \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) September 27, 2019\n\n\u201cNRA resources appear to have been used to pay for membership and registration fees to third party events for the Russian nationals as well as to arrange for transit to and lodging for many of those events throughout 2015 and 2016,\u201d the report says. \u201cThese activities, together with the organization\u2019s travel to Moscow to demonstrate Torshin\u2019s American influence to the Kremlin, indicate that the organization was engaged in a years-long effort to facilitate Butina and Torshin\u2019s domestic activity.\u201d\n\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee who opened the investigation last year, said on Twitter that the reported self-dealing \u201craises serious questions about whether the NRA broke U.S. tax laws.\u201d\n\nThe NRA is currently being investigated by the attorneys general of both Washington, D.C. and New York. They \ufeffhave both served subpoenas demanding financial records from the group that could lead to the loss of its tax-exempt status.\n\nAnd as the group continues to face legal fees and infighting, six board members have resigned from their positions as the group\u2019s popularity continues to plummet.", "description": "An 18-month investigation from Senate Committee on Finance staff reveals how deeply connected the National Rifle Association was with Russian officials.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e543a1e0000a203749f74.jpeg?cache=1mfaavitjj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
