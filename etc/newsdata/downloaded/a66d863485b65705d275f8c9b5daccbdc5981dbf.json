The headline PMI fell to 47.8, marking the lowest level since mid-2009 and holding below the neutral level of 50. This fell below consensus expectations for an increase from August\u2019s level of 49.1, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market, as of 11:15 a.m. ET.\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): -0.61%, or 18.06 points\n\nDow (^DJI): -0.76%, or 204.05 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): -0.41%, or 33.1 points\n\nU.S. crude oil prices (CL=F): +0.31% to $54.24 per barrel\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): -4.5 bps to 1.628%\n\nGold (GC=F): +1.17% to $1,490.20 per ounce\n\nEarlier in the session, the Dow had been up by as many as 129 points.\n\nOctober volatility\n\nThe S&P 500 closed September higher for both the month and quarter. The broad equity market index had its best three-quarter start to the year since 1997, after posting a year-to-date increase of 18.74% through Monday\u2019s close.\n\n\u201cThe market got off easy in September, with another rate cut by the Federal Reserve helping to temper concerns about the U.S.-China trade war,\u201d Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek research, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cThat said, October is notoriously the most volatile month of the year.\u201d\n\nThe VIX \u2013 the so-called \u201cfear gauge\u201d measuring volatility in the market \u2013 has hit annual highs five times in October since its creation in 1990, Rabe said, tying it with August for the greatest number of VIX peaks versus other months.\n\nThe VIX closed September at a reading of 16.24, after averaging at 15.56 for the month. Its peak close for the year-to-date was in early January at 25.45, coming on the heels of a volatile fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nOther market strategists echoed these words of caution.\n\n\u201cWhat has us worried this October is the fact that September this year was historically calm,\u201d Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in an email. \u201cIf we know one thing, it is that markets don\u2019t stay calm forever and after a dull market last month, we could be due for some unusual October volatility.\u201d\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 30: Traders work of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on September 30, 2019 in New York City.

President Trump may also push for more progress on the trade front to instill better consumer confidence for the holidays.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth should help the S&P 500 still end the year on a positive note,\u201d she said.\n\nOverseas markets\n\nOverseas, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Hong Kong Stock Exchange were closed Tuesday for China\u2019s National Day, which commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s rule. The Shanghai Stock Exchange will remain closed the rest of the week in observance of this holiday.\n\nIn a speech Tuesday for the event, China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping maintained that \u201cthere is no force that can shake the foundation\u201d of China, and reiterated a commitment for the central government to \u201cmaintain long-term prosperity and stability\u201d in Hong Kong and Macao, which each are semi-autonomous regions.\n\nAmid the celebrations on mainland China, mass demonstrations continued to transpire in Hong Kong. Protests in the region have now carried on for four consecutive months, with an increasing number of violent incidences punctuating what began as peaceful marches. Hong Kong police shot a protestor at close range on Tuesday, according to multiple reports, and deployed tear gas to try and disperse the demonstrators.\n\nMany economists have underscored the importance of the Hong Kong region to the global economy, with nearly 60% of China\u2019s outbound investment channeled through the city, according to Bloomberg data. Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart has suggested the shock in Hong Kong could drag the global economy into a further slowdown or recession, she told Bloomberg TV in August.", "description": "U.S. stocks turned around and fell after a print on domestic manufacturing activity came in at the weakest level in a decade.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZwbbhgmJJWKXYJkIAZyq7g--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/4e456d80-e445-11e9-befe-c7cc32ac213b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
