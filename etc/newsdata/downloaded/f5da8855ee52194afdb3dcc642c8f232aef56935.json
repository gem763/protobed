Many Pols exercise for hours, or travel for weeks. Me, I run through one of my courses (very inexpensive). President Obama would fly to Hawaii,\u201d Trump said in a pair of tweets that initially misspelled the mayor's name before being corrected.\n\nHe continued: \u201cKhan should focus on \u2018knife crime,\u2019 which is totally out of control in London. People are afraid to even walk the streets. He is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!\u201d\n\nThe tweets come after Khan hit the president over his golf habit. Trump canceled a weekend trip to Poland in which he was set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Nazi invasion that marked the beginning of World War II. Instead, Trump stayed home to monitor the movement of Hurricane Dorian, which left a path of destruction through the Bahamas on Monday and is now on track to hit parts of the East Coast throughout the week. Despite canceling his trip, Trump was spotted at his Virginia golf club two days in a row.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO London Playbook from Warsaw for the ceremonies, Khan mocked Trump\u2019s scrapped plans, saying that \u201che\u2019s clearly busy dealing with a hurricane out on the golf course.\u201d\n\nKhan also took aim at Trump's incendiary rhetoric, accusing the president of emboldening white supremacists.\n\n\u201cThese people have been inspired by mainstream politicians who subscribe to their point of view,\u201d he said, adding that Trump \u201cis a guy who amplifies racist tweets; amplifies the tweets of fascists; says things that are deeply objectionable. If I don\u2019t stand up and call that out I think I\u2019m doing a disservice to Londoners who chose me as their mayor.\u201d\n\nTrump and Khan have butted heads numerous times over the last few years, with Khan objecting to Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to ban Muslims from traveling to the U.S. and Trump returning fire by criticizing Khan\u2019s record on crime while in office. Most recently, the president called Khan a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d as he arrived in the country for a state visit earlier this year.", "description": "\u2018He is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business,\u2019 US president tweets.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Jack Blanchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-997574778-1200x628.jpg"}
