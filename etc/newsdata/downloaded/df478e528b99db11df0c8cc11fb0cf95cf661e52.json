Now, high-profile YouTubers are completing the feedback loop by broadcasting their surgeries\u2014at times in graphic detail.\n\nIn the tireless pursuit for a greater connection with fans, a surgical procedure is one of the last frontiers of extreme online intimacy.\n\nJeffree Star, the head of an eponymous makeup line with 16 million subscribers on YouTube, has returned to his surgeries as subject matter over the past three years\u2014hair transplants, his boyfriend\u2019s armpit botox, and the mending of a congenital esophageal deformity\u2014most recently in February of this year when he had his botched lip injections corrected. Each video reached more than five million viewers.\n\nStar\u2019s original lip injections had, against his wishes, included permanent silicone fillers, a substance that made the underside of his top lips noticeably lumpy. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have to airbrush in photos when I\u2019m at different angles, and it\u2019s something that has haunted me for a long time,\u201d Star said in the video, framing his openness about the procedure as a kind of catharsis.\n\nSometimes, sharing a surgery is part of an intimate personal journey.\n\nTwo of the Try Guys, the four-man collective dedicated to testing their boundaries on camera for more than six million subscribers, have undergone knee and hair transplant surgeries, each in the past six months, before an audience of 7 million. More than 10 million watched all four of them receive surgery consultations in July 2018.\n\nThis March, one of the four, Ned Fulmer, described a close call with opioid addiction after a previous surgery. The video detailed the procedure and showed him dumping his prescription painkillers down the toilet in triumph.\n\nOther times, an influencer might just film a surgery for a LOL.\n\nThe Dolan Twins, an identical influencer pair with more than 10 million subscribers on YouTube, filmed two videos in August 2019 about their sinus surgery that, in total, have 11 million views. They did the same thing in 2016 with their dual wisdom teeth removals.\n\n\u201cBasically, we\u2019re getting surgery, we heard we\u2019re gonna be loopy, we might as well film it so we remember and see what fools we made of ourselves, and we can share it with you,\u201d Ethan Dolan said in the video. Watching and reacting to your own surgery, as the Dolans have done, is a subset within the genre.\n\nAnd, like everything else on social media, a surgery can be an advertisement.\n\nIn November 2018, Rosanna Pansino, 11.5 million subscribers, filmed a Q&A about her egg-freezing surgery that featured clips of her apparently under anesthesia and ended with a sweepstakes sponsored by a kitchenware company; 2.7 million people watched.\n\nAUTHENTIC BUT ENHANCED\n\nThe trend isn\u2019t new\u2014but it is newly popular. Trisha Paytas, a vlogger with almost 5 million subscribers, began sharing her journey through plastic surgery seven years ago. Gigi Gorgeous, a trans YouTuber, has closely documented her gender transition and its associated surgeries for at least the past five years.\n\nBut, according to social media marketing professionals who spoke to The Daily Beast, surgery videos are newly popular.\n\nJames Nord, CEO of the influencer marketing platform Fohr, said that medical content is a natural extension of a life vlogged. He\u2019s seen it on the rise over the past two years, most commonly with cosmetic surgery.\n\n\u201cOnce it becomes normal to document your life in the detail that these influencers are, you enter into this alternative universe where social norms are erased,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get so comfortable sharing everything that it does feel natural.\u201d\n\nHe attributes the increase in medical videos to the normalization of plastic surgery by the Kardashian family and others, but a key difference between celebrities and influencers, he said, is the level of disclosure fans expect. A celebrity might get plastic surgery and hide away for a month, but an influencer can\u2019t even disappear for a few days without incurring suspicion from followers. As a result, influencer don\u2019t feel they need to hide it; maybe they couldn\u2019t even if they wanted to.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s seen as a breach of trust with your audience if you don\u2019t tell them, and if you lose that trust, you lose the following,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your whole account is about beauty tips and looking younger and you get a bunch of plastic surgeries, your followers are going to find out.\u201d\n\nThe fuel of an influencer\u2019s fame and following is an impression of authenticity, Nord said, and sharing a secret with a person\u2014or a few million\u2014is a powerful connection.\n\nSome YouTubers do integrate their health into their everyday routine video diaries. New Zealand beauty vlogger shaaanxo (555,000 subscribers) posted a video in May 2018 where she talked about becoming sick after her breast implants. In the video, she went shopping, cleaned her room, made toast, and got botox. The video appeared to document a regular day in her life, with the video thumbnail showing a needle stuck in her face.\n\nNord\u2019s agency has coordinated a few campaigns with breast implant makers and influencers who have undergone breast augmentations, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about authenticity with influencers. If you\u2019re pushing a drug for diabetes, you\u2019re not going to have an influencer who doesn\u2019t have diabetes do that,\u201d Joe Gagliese, CEO of the influencer marketing agency Viral Nation, told The Daily Beast. \u201cBut plastic surgery, medical cosmetics\u2014it\u2019s exploding. Every single plastic surgeon is thinking about it.\u201d\n\nGagliese said he\u2019s personally seen medical videos on social media \u201creally pick up\u201d in the past 18 months, though he first spotted the trend a few years ago. He considers well-known influencers\u2019 medical videos as an outgrowth of the groundswell of doctors who have become social media stars, garnering millions of followers in some cases. Some even share videos of whole surgeries (with patients\u2019 consent).\n\n\u201cCosmetic surgeons becoming big on social propelled it, celebrities started talking more about about it, and influencers followed suit,\u201d he said. \u201cInfluencers are getting procedures from doctors who are also influencers. It\u2019s becoming this social thing.\u201d\n\nWerner Geyser, CEO of the marketing technology company Influencer Marketing Hub, agreed with Gagliese that influencer doctors laid the groundwork.\n\n\u201cThere are influencers in just about every field of life, so it should be no surprise that there are medical influencers,\u201d he said of popular online doctors.\n\nFohr\u2019s Nord sees the advertising power of an influencer making medical content in their recommendations.\n\n\u201cPlastic surgery is built on referrals,\u201d Nord said. \u201cIt makes sense as an industry where you want trust more than anything else. If this trusted influencer is recommending someone, that would do a lot to move a person about to make that decision.\u201d\n\nREALSTAGRAM\n\nContent trends also align with aesthetic ones. The polished Instagram look is going by the wayside, replaced by off-kilter and unposed photos with less sheen but more authenticity.\n\n\u201cA lot more people are going for \u2018realstagram.\u2019 They\u2019re are trying to be as real as possible in contrast to Instagram as this perfect world where everything is edited,\u201d said Lizzie MacNeil, public relations and partnerships lead at the social media scheduling and analytics company Later.com.\n\nMedical procedures are often revolting, too, taking on a grisly aesthetic that thrives on social media in opposition to the expected manicured influencer look. \u201cThe more gruesome the better,\u201d as Influencer Marketing Hub\u2019s Geyser described it.\n\nAs far as more mundane horrors go, the cost of healthcare is an omnipresent American fear. Making a video about a cosmetic procedure, Nord said, can also be a way to barter for valuable services. Influencers who make videos with a certain doctor will often be provided the procedure gratis, he said. The quid pro quo can save them thousands, if not tens of thousands.\n\nTraditional celebrities may not be as stressed about medical debt, but they too suffer the humiliating limits of mortality. The New York Daily News regularly updates a running story headlined \u201cHospitalized celebs\u201d that includes snaps of Zac Efron, Jessica Simpson, Kate Beckinsale with the caption \u201cThere's nothing like a common cold or injury to remind Hollywood's biggest stars that they are\u2014in fact\u2014just human.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s what influencers want to say to us, too.\n\nFor social media stars, whose occupation is to plumb the depths of their lives in search of more to share, the medical is unfakeable, inimitable content.\n\n\u201cIt gets a lot of attention,\u201d Nord told The Daily Beast. \u201cOther creators won\u2019t be able to replicate your brain surgery.\u201d", "description": "A traditional celebrity might get plastic surgery and hide away for a month, but a new wave of authenticity-obsessed influencers see surgery as top-shelf content.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569115317/GettyImages-71205638_1_x5dqto", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
