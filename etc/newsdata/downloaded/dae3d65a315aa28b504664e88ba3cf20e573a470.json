It could not provide more precise figures because its findings were based on sample checks and statistical estimates.\n\nIrregular payments are usually the result of mistakes or the wrong application of EU rules but in the worst cases they can hide full-fledged fraud. Only for a handful of payments did the court raise concerns to investigative authorities, the report said.\n\nLast year, the EU anti-fraud office OLAF recommended the recovery of 371 million euros of EU funds because of criminal abuses.\n\nThe irregularities detected are likely to represent a fraction of all errors in EU spending because of the limited resources available to auditors to conduct checks.\n\nAuthorities in EU states where EU money is spent are not always very keen to help. Irregularities in spending could lead to reimbursements of funds that in some EU states, especially in the east and the south of the bloc, are crucial for local economies.\n\nEU auditors found more than 70% of the irregularities emerged last year in spending on poorer regions of the bloc, the ECA report said, while authorities of the 28 EU states detected the remainder.\n\nIn some cases, EU auditors detected errors in projects that had already been approved by national authorities. \"Member states' auditors need to get better at doing their checks,\" said one EU official.", "description": "Billions of euros of EU funds misspent last year: auditors", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF961OF_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
