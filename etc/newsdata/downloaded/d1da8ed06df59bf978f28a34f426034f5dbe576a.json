(Photo courtesy of Kristie Holmes, Art by Quinn Lemmers for Yahoo Lifestyle)\n\nA typical school run turned out to be anything but for Los Angeles-based psychologist Kristie Holmes, who ended up having a heart attack during her drive.\n\nHolmes, 44, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she got a pain in her neck while she was securing her daughter into her car seat. \u201cIt felt like I slept on my neck wrong, but it was weirder than that,\u201d she says. Holmes says she had a feeling that something was seriously wrong with her health, but couldn\u2019t put her finger on it.\n\n\u201cI sat in the driver\u2019s seat and I had a sense that I needed to drive rather than sit in my driveway,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can sit here and I\u2019ll die, or I\u2019ll drive.\u2019 I had no idea what was going on. I just had a sense that I was going to die if I didn\u2019t get help.\u201d\n\nDuring her drive, Holmes decided to call 911 and she warned her three kids in the car (including her 2-month-old baby) that she was making the call. Holmes, who says she\u2019s never called 911 before, still wasn\u2019t sure what compelled her to call, but she says \u201cI just knew I had to call. I was sure of it. Something was definitely wrong.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: What to Know About SCAD\n\nOnce she was connected, Holmes says she quickly became irritated when she realized the dispatcher was implying that she was having a panic attack. \u201cI told her, \u2018This is not a panic attack. This is not a stressful day. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling this way, but I need help,\u2019\u201d Holmes says. \u201cShe believed me and said that the ambulance was coming.\u201d So, Holmes pulled over into the car pool lane and waited for help to arrive.\n\n\u201cI rolled down the windows so that the other parents heard what was happening,\u201d she says. One father got into the car and helped her with her breathing. \u201cThen, my hands started going in different directions,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control my arms.\u201d\n\nThe ambulance finally arrived and parents took Holmes\u2019s children into school. Her daughter\u2019s former preschool was across the street and the headmistress came over and took her baby. \u201cEveryone helped,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very small town for LA.\u201d\n\nThe ambulance paramedic immediately started screening Holmes for anxiety and she stressed to him that she was not having a panic attack. He finally did an electrocardiogram, a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat and then \u201cfreaked out and started yelling into a speaker,\u201d Holmes recalls.\n\nHolmes was taken to Cedars-Sinai hospital, where she learned she had a spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), a tear forms in an artery in the heart. SCAD can reduce or block blood flow through the artery, leading to a heart attack, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). SCAD patients are often women who are otherwise healthy, with few or no risk factors for heart disease, the AHA says.\n\nHolmes later learned that her heart was functioning at 10 percent, and she was sent to surgery. There, doctors put five stents into her heart and connected her to an Impella heart pump to help her heart function.\n\nHolmes says she was \u201ca little confused\u201d afterward. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why there were so many people in the waiting room,\u201d she says. Holmes ended up spending 55 days in the hospital, with the majority of them in the intensive care unit.\n\nNow, she says, she\u2019s \u201ctired\u2026 but I think that\u2019s normal. I have three kids and a job.\u201d Holmes says she\u2019s \u201con a lot of medications\u201d and sees a cardiologist. She also has some physical limitations. \u201cHolding things over my head or standing in line for a long time can make me pass out,\u201d she says.\n\nHolmes says a nurse later told her that her sense of doom tends to happen in some heart attack patients. \u201cI was fortunate that people were willing to listen to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were a lot of hurdles for me not to be dead. It took a lot of humans who listened, believed my story, were trained and could recognize that my situation was serious.\u201d", "description": "Krstie Holmes, 44, tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she got a pain in her neck while she was securing her daughter into her car seat.", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c1Wy12bsaDerAMMF0LnpyA--~B/aD0xNTEyO3c9MjgwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/ee75ff00-d3e6-11e9-9a77-d7ce476f1a21", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
