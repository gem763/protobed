They\u2019ve since been returned to England, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement.\n\nEileen Connors, 24, has said she and her family mistakenly crossed the border into Washington state while trying to avoid an animal in the road and were swiftly taken into custody by U.S. Border Patrol. Connors\u2018 affidavit said family members were subsequently incarcerated in a series of cold and dirty immigration facilities and \u201ctreated like criminals\u201d as they waited to be sent home.\n\nU.S. officials have asserted the family crossed the border on purpose, noting their vehicle was observed \u201cslowly and deliberately\u201d driving through a ditch to cross into U.S. territory in Blaine, Washington, on Oct. 2. Two of the family members had previously been denied entry to the U.S., according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nFamily representatives blasted the border agency\u2019s response Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are not surprised that the agency would put the character of non-citizen victims of their misconduct and neglect into question to justify their actions. This is CBP\u2019s typical response to accountability. However, their communication in no way contradicts the family\u2019s account that for a brief moment they turned into an unmarked road on United States soil,\u201d said a statement from Aldea - The People\u2019s Justice Center.\n\nThe Pennsylvania-based immigrant advocacy group added \u201cthere is nothing that justifies the imprisonment of babies and toddlers, for any period of time.\u201d\n\nThe family had been detained at the Berks County Residential Center outside Reading since Oct. 5. In her affidavit, Eileen Connors described a frigid facility with dirty, malfunctioning bathrooms and uncaring, negligent staff.\n\nHer complaints have been echoed by other detainees at the Berks facility, one of three family detention centers in the U.S. that hold children and parents who are seeking asylum or who entered the country illegally. Activists have long called for the detention center\u2019s closure.\n\nAldea, which represents immigrant families detained at Berks, said the facility currently holds 27 children, including seven children under the age of 5.\n\nU.S. immigration officials have said the Berks center \u201chas an outstanding track record.\u201d\n\nAn email seeking comment from British consular officials in New York on the family\u2019s treatment in U.S. custody was not immediately returned.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A British family that made an unauthorized crossing from Canada into the United States was deported Wednesday after nearly two weeks in federal custody, ending an ordeal that family members called the worst of their lives.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Rubinkam"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/vacationing_family_detained_border_84477_c0-0-3241-1891_s1200x700.jpg?5a3a7de92bf74435d59bc1b01da991bfb6877c8c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
