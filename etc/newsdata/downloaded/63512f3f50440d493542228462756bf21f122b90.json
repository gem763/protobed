Nurmagomedov was shuttled away with a phalanx of security guards. Beer rained on the champ just as he made the exit at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nIt was an ugly moment in an otherwise triumphant night for Nurmagomedov, who likely will face disciplinary action from the NSAC.\n\nThe madness also spilled outside of the arena afterward (via Twitter).\n\nBad blood certainly flowed between the champ and McGregor\u2019s team in the build-up to the fight; indeed, it was one of the centerpieces of the promotion for UFC 229. When McGregor teammate Artem Lobov was confronted by Nurmagomedov prior to UFC 223, it sent the ex-champ into a rage that culminated in a bus attack that left several fighters injured and McGregor arrested.\n\nIt\u2019s now the second time a fight has erupted outside of the octagon. The previous time, White called it one of the most disgusting moments in UFC history. Then, it became part of the commercial.\n\nIf history is any indication, Saturday\u2019s embarrassment will become the highlight reel for a rematch.\n\nFor complete coverage of UFC 229, check out the UFC Events section of the site.", "description": "The bad blood between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor overflowed after their UFC 229 title fight.", "authors": ["Steven Marrocco", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/khabib-nurmagomedov-ufc-229.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2018-10-07"}
