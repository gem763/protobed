The 27-year-old hurled the spear to a distance 62.43m in her second-round throw, beating her earlier national record of 62.34 m, a feat she achieved in March. With the achievement, Rani is now the first Indian to reach the finals of the women's javelin throw in the World Championships.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnu was the fifth-best performer of the qualification round and finished third in Group A. Only two javelin throwers, Asian champion Lyu Huihui (67.27m) of China and Christin Hussong (65.29m) of Germany, could cross the automatic qualification mark of 63.50m while another 10, including Annu, made up the 12, who will compete in the finals.\n\n\n\n\n\nRani\u2019s rise is one of grit and ambition; the athlete\u2019s talent was spotted by her brother who encouraged her to pursue her dream even though her conservative family and society forbade it. Annu was initially coached by Kashinath Naik and is now coached by Baljeet Singh. In 2014, Rani won the bronze at the Asian Games at Incheon, with a throw of 59.53m. In 2017, in Bhubaneswar, she got a bronze medal at the Asian Athletics Championships with a throw of 57.32m. In April 2019, she won a silver medal in the women\u2019s javelin throw event at the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships in Qatar on April 21, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, in August 2019, at the Podblanicka Tretra athletics meet at Vlasim, Czech Republic, Rani finished second with a 60.87m throw behind Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi.", "description": "Annu Rani, India\u2019s woman javelin thrower, qualified for the final round of the World Athletics Championships by smashing her own national record at Doha yesterd", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/sthannurani1569914340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
