Things kicked off at breakfast and will last into the night. By early evening, he was being handed an award for the world\u2019s longest-ever press conference on the basis he\u2019d eclipsed Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of neighboring Belarus.\n\n\u201cIt was the president who came up with this format,\u201d said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, his deputy chief of staff.\n\nIt was a set-up that seemed straight out of the Vladimir Putin school of media interaction. The Russian president has a yearly call-in show where he answers questions for hours on end.\n\nOur reporter, given a graveyard shift around dinner time, bumped into the star attraction as he headed to the bathroom. Would he last that long? He said he would, but may need some glucose -- and grabbed a juice.\n\nInterest in Zelenskiy is off the charts -- U.S. network television and other international media hopped on a plane overnight to be at the event that was hastily arranged at the last minute. On arrival, Zelinskiy said: \u201cCool place, never been here before.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s an unwitting participant in the impeachment saga that\u2019s ensnared Donald Trump and was triggered by the now infamous phone conversation between the U.S. president and the novice leader. During that call in July, Zelenskiy told Trump he wanted more weapons from the U.S. to counter Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThere was no blackmail,\u201d said Zelenskiy, in a white shirt with one button undone, no tie and hands clasped together. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a subject of our talk.\u201d\n\nLater he was asked whether he apologized to Angela Merkel. In the call, Zelenskiy agreed with Trump when the U.S. leader said \u201cGermany does almost nothing for you\u201d -- \u201call they do is talk.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy said he spoke to Merkel on Wednesday and they were good. He said EU leaders understood why he said what he said.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Trump was not the very first thing the Ukrainian president was asked about as the marathon session got underway.\n\nFor local media, there\u2019s the fraught relationship with Russia, corruption at home and concern about Zelenskiy\u2019s ties to a local billionaire who owns the TV station that hosted his hit sitcom, \u201cServant Of The People.\u201d That\u2019s the show where art imitated life: A high school history teacher wins the presidency almost by accident, much like Zelenskiy\u2019s own surprising political journey.\n\nNow in power, the shine has already come off, especially after the transcript of the July call showed Zelenskiy out of his depth and fawning over Trump. Some are questioning whether he\u2019s really the reformer he sold himself as. On Thursday, he squabbled with some reporters, growing visibly irritated when quizzed by a journalist from a local magazine that\u2019s been critical of him.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop him though. With the event already 11 hours in and running well behind schedule, Zelenskiy\u2019s press secretary assured reporters that everyone would get their chance to speak to him -- even if that means staying beyond midnight.\n\n(Updates with record in third paragraph, delays in last.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Daryna Krasnolutska in Kyev at dkrasnolutsk@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, ;Rosalind Mathieson at rmathieson3@bloomberg.net, Andrew Langley, Michael Winfrey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- He kept the world waiting five months for a news conference, but when Volodymyr Zelenskiy finally got round to it, the Ukrainian television-actor-elected-president put on quite the show.Picture the scene: a trendy food court in central Kyiv, 315 accredited journalists and a casually dressed", "authors": ["Daryna Krasnolutska"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
