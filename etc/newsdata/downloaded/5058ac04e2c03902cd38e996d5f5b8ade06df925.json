The Times of India said \"thousands of bees\" had landed on the window, blocking pilots' vision.\n\nAirport staff then decided to spray them off with water \u2014 a process that worked but needed the help of the fire brigade and took an hour.\n\nKaushik Bhattcharya, an airport official, told AFP: \"Fire tenders were deployed to spray water to dislodge the honey bees and they could be driven away after nearly an hour-long operation.\"\n\nYou can see the swarm on this picture, shared by The Telegraph India:\n\nThe flight was already delayed by almost 90 minutes over a technical issue before the bees arrived, Simple Flying reported. The plane eventually took off more than three-and-a-half hours later than scheduled.\n\nA spokesperson for Air India spokesperson told The Telegraph that the bees could have \"damaged the plane and harmed the passengers\" if they flew into the engines.\n\nRead more: A flight from Germany to Mexico was forced to land in Ireland after the pilot spilled coffee on the plane's controls\n\nPlanes are not allowed to take off if insects are on the cockpit window, an unnamed pilot told The Times of India.\n\n\"First, the swarm hampers pilots' visibility. Secondly, each aircraft has several small probes, which determine the static pressure and the total pressure of an airflow located in the vicinity of the aircraft.\n\n\"These are extremely sensitive and even if one bee goes inside the probe, the airspeed indicators can go wrong, leading to a major accident.\"\n\nBhattcharya told The Times of India that airport staff have looked for hives around the airport, but have yet to find any.", "description": "Firefighters were eventually brought in to get the plane, with 135 passengers and Bangladesh's information minister on board, to take off.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80a3622e22af2ba30cb766-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
