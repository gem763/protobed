Christchurch is on the South Island.\n\nBut judge Cameron Mander announced at the beginning of proceedings that the defence had decided not to pursue the application, which was originally lodged in August.\n\nNo reason was given for the decision.\n\nThe 28-year-old Australian has pleaded not guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and engaging in a 'terrorist' to act.\n\nTarrant, a self-avowed white supremacist, appeared at the hearing via audio-visual link from a maximum security jail in Auckland, although media were barred from filming or photographing him.\n\nMany of the 80 or so people packed into the courtroom expressed dismay at Tarrant's behaviour during the brief hearing as he smirked, winked and tried to shout something with his hand cupped around his mouth.\n\nHis trial will begin on June 2 next year.\n\nThe unexpected development was welcomed by survivors and relatives of those killed in the March 15 attacks, who had worried they would have had to travel to the North Island to appear as witnesses or observe the proceedings.\n\nThe Christchurch attack was the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's modern history.", "description": "Survivors and grieving families of victims welcome news that the trial will be in Christchurch when it starts in June.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/4/4/9ee1b320e79f4964ac65f2b71b57dd2f_18.jpg"}
