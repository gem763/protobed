The app will offer subs 80,000 recipes and 25 live cooking classes a week from international chefs like Martha Stewart, Guy Fieri, and Bobby Flay. It's slated to launch in October and cost $7 a month or $60 a year.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThe SVOD app could grow fast thanks to its direct affiliation with Amazon. In addition to being available on phones and tablets, the app will be integrated into Amazon's Echo Show smart display device lineup \u2014 including the latest device in that product line, the Echo Show 8, which the company just launched yesterday.\n\nSmart display shipments reached 6.4 million units in 2018, accounting for 8% of the total smart speaker market, per Canalys. These devices are relatively new, but are expected to increasingly contribute to overall smart speaker sales, per Strategy Analytics. Amazon already leads the smart speaker market, and that status could easily translate to the smart display devices as well.\n\nPractical services like Discovery's Food Network Kitchen could further incentivize consumers to adopt such devices in a way that likewise expands the opportunity for the SVOD. If Echo Show unit sales increase as a result, that could benefit Discovery by goosing subs as well as the potential for voice-activated shopping sales, of which Discovery will take a cut.\n\nThe offering gives Discovery a third way to monetize its streaming video offering, beyond subscription or advertising dollars \u2014 affiliate revenue. Most SVOD services rely exclusively on subscription revenue from paid subscribers, while others, like Hulu and the forthcoming Peacock from NBCUniversal, have adopted hybrid models that offer the dual revenue stream of both subscription and ad dollars.\n\nBut this move by Discovery also offers a third revenue stream that's untapped by rival services: Subscribers to Food Network Kitchen will be able to use the app to buy ingredients for recipes shown in classes via Amazon Fresh and other food-delivery services like Peapod, and Discovery will take a cut of sales converted through the app.\n\nThat opportunity will be limited to those who subscribe to various online grocery services: For example, it's unclear how many markets Amazon Fresh is in, and the service costs an additional $180 a year ($15 a month) on top of the $120 cost of an annual Prime membership, which has likely applied some downward pressure on the service's growth. Nevertheless, the service is likely to convert some sales in a way competing services can't.\n\nBy launching multiple niche SVOD services \u2014 dedicated to established network brands \u2014 Discovery can ideally cover as much ground as rival services which boast more diversified programming. As pay-TV shrinks and streaming consumption grows, Disney, WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal are all planning to launch massive, unified SVOD services.\n\nAs I argued in April, Discovery's niche SVOD strategy diverges from the direct-to-consumer strategies being developed by other media conglomerates. By virtue of targeting specific markets, the niche SVOD opportunity is automatically narrower, and therefore these niche services tend to attract fewer subscribers than larger, more diversified services like Netflix. For example, AT&T's anime-focused Crunchyroll has crossed 2 million paid subs as of last November, compared with 152 million paid streaming subs who have Netflix worldwide.\n\nBut by launching a slew of such services, Discovery may be able to tap a near-equivalent market opportunity for SVOD household uptake given the span of its various offerings. Further, because these services are targeting superfan bases, subs are likely to be stickier over time, lessening the ever-present risk of churn on subscription media services.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
