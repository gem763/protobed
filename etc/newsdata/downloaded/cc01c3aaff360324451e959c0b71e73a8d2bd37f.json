So the 11-inch 1TB iPad Pro is now $1,349 for Wi-Fi only or $1,499 if you want LTE, while the larger 12.9-inch device is $1,549 or $1,699. MacRumors first reported the change.\n\nRetailers like Best Buy and B&H have periodically sold the 1TB iPad Pros at a similar discount, but this marks an official price change. Apple hasn\u2019t changed pricing for other storage sizes of its flagship tablet, however.\n\nRumors have indicated that Apple might be planning an iPad Pro update before the end of this year \u2014 perhaps to add the new triple-camera system from the iPhone 11 Pro, among other upgrades. If it happens, it\u2019d be an unusually fast update cycle for the product, which typically hasn\u2019t seen annual revamps.\n\nThe 1TB iPad Pro is the only iPad with 6GB of RAM; other 2018 iPad Pros have 4GB. With the increased focus on multitasking in iPadOS, that added memory can only help. But don\u2019t buy this expensive tablet for RAM. You should only get it if you know you\u2019ll need that huge amount of storage for video editing, a large media collection, or who knows what else.", "description": "Apple has slashed the price of its 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros with 1TB of storage by $200.
