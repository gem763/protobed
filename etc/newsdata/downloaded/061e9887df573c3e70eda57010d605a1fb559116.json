El Paso prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Crusius, who remains jailed without bond.\n\nCrusius\u2019 defense lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. Attorney Mark Stevens previously said he will use \u201cevery legal tool available\u201d to prevent his client from being executed.\n\nThe El Paso County District Clerk\u2019s office said Crusius\u2019 indictment would not be publicly available until next week.\n\nProsecutors have said Crusius surrendered to police after the attack saying, \u201cI\u2019m the shooter,\u201d and that he was targeting Mexicans. In court documents, prosecutors alleged that Crusius was the author of a screed published shortly before the shooting that said it was \u201cin response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors have said they are weighed hate-crime charges against Crusius that could also carry the death penalty.\n\nSurvivors of the El Paso attack have held vigils around the city, including outside of the jail in downtown El Paso where Crusius has been kept isolated from other prisoners, on suicide watch.\n\nThe El Paso massacre, along with another August mass shooting in the Texas cities of Midland and Odessa, has fueled anger among gun control and immigration advocates, and caused political blowback.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott acknowledged weeks after the attack that \u201cmistakes were made\u201d when he sent a fundraising mailer encouraging supporters to \u201ctake matters into our own hands\u201d and \u201cDEFEND\u201d Texas. Abbott has pledged to invest in a domestic terrorism taskforce and has suggested he would support an expansion of firearm background checks. He has resisted calls to regulate the sale of military-style rifles like the one authorities say Crusius used in El Paso.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick drew the ire of the NRA last week after expressed support for background checks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A man accused of gunning down people at a busy Walmart in El Paso last month was indicted Thursday for capital murder, prosecutors announced.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/mass_shooting_texas_42577_c0-0-4158-2424_s1770x1032.jpg?48afb62ee72323af94f8aeb6186bbc7cc041467f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
