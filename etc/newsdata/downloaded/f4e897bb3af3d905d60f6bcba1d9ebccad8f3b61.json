Mahmood can deliver 90mph toe crunchers on flat tracks", "language": "en", "text": "It is fair to say that England new boy Saqib Mahmood thinks a lot about fast bowling. Talk to him for half an hour and, such is his passion for the art, you get the impression there is little time for anything else in his young life.\n\nStill only 22, he has developed two distinctly different bowling actions \u2014 one for Test cricket and another for limited-overs matches. He requires very different skills, he recognises, to be successful with red and white ball both.\n\nMahmood stands 6ft 2in tall and although he makes the most of his frame to deliver the ball from its highest possible point in first-class cricket, he has engineered a longer delivery stride for limited-overs matches, allowing him to create a much lower trajectory.\n\nLancashire paceman Saqib Mahmood has been dubbed the best death bowler in the country\n\nTo accommodate this he extends his County Championship run up of 26 steps to one of 27.\n\n\u2018I want to get long in my delivery stride compared to red-ball cricket because that\u2019s where I get my pace,\u2019 says Mahmood, whose performances in the North v South series 18 months ago led Paul Collingwood, now one of England\u2019s assistant coaches, to privately dub him the best death bowler in the country.\n\nBy that stage, another top-level ECB coach had recognised something familiar about the way he whipped yorker-length deliveries on to the base of leg-stump.\n\nMahmood says: \u2018A few years ago, I was working with Ottis Gibson and he told me \u201cOh, you bowl a bit like Waqar Younis\u201d. But Waqar was before my time and I\u2019d never watched him.\n\n\u2018So, all of a sudden I\u2019m watching YouTube clips seeing the kind of things he did and comparing it to what I do and just seeing how I can better myself. Yeah, when I do try and bowl yorkers I bring my arm down at the back end. It helps me sort of spear them in and get the ball tailing as well.\n\nThe 22-year-old makes the most of his frame to deliver the ball from highest possible point\n\n\u2018Even this year, with the new ball, I was hitting a length where guys would get stuck on the crease and the stumps were still in play because of that trajectory.\u2019\n\nHis prowess was reflected in him being named player of the 2019 Royal London Cup for 28 wickets in only 10 appearances.\n\nHe was less prolific in Twenty20 but his attributes meant he had long been earmarked for a place on tomorrow\u2019s England flight to New Zealand for a five-match series which will begin the countdown to next year\u2019s 20-over World Cup.\n\nThe surprise perhaps was that a man yet to claim a five-wicket haul in first-class cricket has also been included for the two Tests that follow. Even Mahmood himself was taken aback when word came from Ed Smith, the national selector.\n\nMahmood says: \u2018When he told me I was on both squads, I had to say \u201cSorry, did you say the T20s and the Tests?\u201d He was like: \u201cYeah\u201d.\n\nMahmood has developed different bowling actions for Test and limited-overs matches\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t hear the rest of the phone call. All I can think is \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m going to be playing for England\u201d. Your mind just goes blank, and he\u2019s still talking. He went: \u201cHave you got any questions?\u201d\n\n\u2018Sorry, mate, I am just trying to take all this in! I didn\u2019t want to tell him I hadn\u2019t heard a thing he\u2019d said after he broke the news to me.\u2019\n\nMahmood has been selected for what he might be able to do not on home soil but elsewhere around the globe.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m working towards being that seamer who can move the ball both ways and be consistent but at the moment I feel I am probably more suited towards Test cricket outside of England,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018The brand of cricket England play is exciting and you want to watch exciting cricket. That\u2019s exactly what you get with this England side.\u2019", "description": "EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY RICHARD GIBSON: It is fair to say that England new boy Saqib Mahmood thinks a lot about fast bowling.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19935866-0-image-a-10_1571515860742.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
