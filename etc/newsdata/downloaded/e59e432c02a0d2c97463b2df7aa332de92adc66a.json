As Gurriel stretched, Turner ran into his glove, and the ball bounced off Turner\u2019s leg and into foul territory. Turner ended up at second, with lead runner Yan Gomes going to third \u2014 except Holbrook quickly signaled for interference.\n\nTurner was called out and Gomes sent back to first base. After some argument from Martinez and the Nationals, umpires went to the headsets for 4 \u00bd minutes before upholding the call after a delay that stretched for 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cI mean what else do you do? I don\u2019t know. The batter\u2019s box is in fair territory. First base is in fair territory. I swung, I ran a straight line, I get hit with the ball, I\u2019m out,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. I can understand it if I veered one way or the other. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals wanted to pursue a protest, and Turner was heard on television pointing to Torre, MLB\u2019s chief baseball officer, in the stands and shouting \u201cHe\u2019s right there!\u201d and \u201cJust ask him!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe call was the fact that he interfered with Gurriel trying to catch the ball,\u201d Torre said, adding that Holbrook \u201cmade the right call at first base.\u201d\n\nTurner said he was pointing out Torre because he felt there could have been some clarification then about what had just happened.\n\n\u201cWe should do everything we possibly can to get the calls on the field right. If it\u2019s in the rules that I did the wrong thing, then so be it, but I think this stage is too big and too important to a lot of people to have every avenue not taken advantage,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI just think we should do everything we can to get everything as right as possible. Let the players decide the outcome.\u201d\n\nThe Major League Baseball Umpires Association tweeted that the call was correct. The Association\u2019s statement said Turner did not run in the three-foot lane located in foul territory. Runners are permitted to exit the running lane to touch first base, which is in fair territory, but they must remain in the lane until moving toward first with a \u201cstep, stride, reach or slide.\u201d\n\nMartinez stepped onto the field to talk with Holbrook and crew chief Gary Cederstrom after the inning and quickly became animated. Six weeks after having a heart procedure, Martinez was restrained by bench coach Chip Hale \u2014 or at least Hale tried \u2014 as the manager kept shouting and eventually was tossed.\n\nMartinez is the first manager to be ejected from a World Series game since Atlanta\u2019s Bobby Cox in 1996.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit here and talk about me or the umpires,\u201d Martinez said in response to a question about the scene. \u201cThis is not about me or the umpires.\u201d\n\nTwo batters after Holbrook\u2019s call, Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer to put Washington ahead 5-2. Rendon added a two-run double for a 7-2 lead in the ninth.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he was out of the line,\u201d Rendon said, adding he was happy to take a seat and rest during the delay.\n\nTorre came onto the field a half-inning later and had a conversation with Cederstrom.\n\nHolbrook\u2019s call was roundly criticized by other players on social media. Cleveland Indians pitcher Mike Clevinger tweeted it was \u201cjust plain ugly,\u201d and Chicago Cubs slugger Kyle Schwarber called it \u201ca bad rule,\u201d suggesting MLB should adopt a wider \u201csafety bag\u201d like those used in many slow pitch softball leagues.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre says the \"right call\" was made and that a protest was denied after Nationals leadoff hitter Trea", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/9c16f3_aptopix-world-series-nationals-astros-baseball-85561-washington-nationals-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
