The coat retails for about $6,000 at MichaelKors.com.\n\nTo pair with the coat, Melania Trump wore black satin Manolo Blahnik pointed stilettos \u2014 her most preferred style of footwear. Mrs. Trump has been widely inspired by the fashions of the 1970s, often opting for A-line coat dresses in suede and leather with statement belts and jutting collars.\n\nLast year, Mrs. Trump channeled a 1960s-inspired look for Halloween in a checkered Bottega Veneta yellow and black coat. Perhaps next year we can expect a 1980s-esque, broad-shouldered coat from some of the recent Yves Saint Laurent collections?\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
