This beats the best price that we\u2019ve seen by $30, and it\u2019s quite a large price drop for Apple\u2019s most affordable iPad. Usually, it costs around $100 to jump up from the 32GB option to the 128GB model, but it\u2019ll only cost $50 to do that today. The 32GB iPad is $249.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you\u2019re deciding between which iPad is best for you, choosing can feel daunting. I\u2019ve written a guide that should help clear things up, but here\u2019s the basic overview for this iPad: get this one if you don\u2019t mind that it doesn\u2019t have crispest display offered on an iPad or the most powerful hardware. It can still run any app that the other models can, but not as swiftly. Another thing that\u2019s worth mentioning is that it lacks Apple\u2019s Smart Connector to easily connect its Smart Keyboard. That\u2019s not a huge deal, but it\u2019s worth knowing if you plan to use the iPad primarily for productivity.\n\nBest Buy is currently the only retailer to offer the iPad at this price, but we\u2019ll update this post should others jump into the ring.", "description": "Best Buy currently has the lowest price that we\u2019ve seen on the sixth-generation iPad with 128GB of storage.
