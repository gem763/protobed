Sharif-Askary explained:\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s really funny, I get asked this a lot - there\u2019s this rhetoric in the media about when are institutional investors going to get involved, when are they going to start investing, and it\u2019s so funny because it\u2019s ironic. We see institutional investors invest with us all the time and that\u2019s been the case for a long time now.\u201d\n\nInvestors are comfortable with altcoins again\n\nThese comments contrast with the general industry sentiment on institutional interest since trading platform Bakkt\u2019s disappointing launch in September.\n\nSince then, many have assumed that institutions will be deterred from Bitcoin (BTC) for the time being as various data sources highlighted that publicity around institutional involvement is hitting lows in recent weeks.\n\nSharif-Askary meanwhile noted that investment activity disregards price suppression. In Q2, around 25% of total inflows targeted altcoins, she revealed, adding that it was \u201cgreat to see that diversification\u201d across different assets.\n\nGrayscale currently offers trusts for nine cryptocurrencies, including Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) in addition to Bitcoin itself.", "description": "A senior Grayscale executive dispels the myth that institutions\u2019 crypto enthusiasm has waned, noting that a quarter of Q2 funds went into altcoins", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMmJmZTZhZDY2NTMzNTU3NmI2NzY0YjE4MTVlNTFlNDcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
