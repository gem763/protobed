In July the following year, a 22-year-old man surnamed Yoon was caught and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nYoon was identified by the National Forensic Service from pubic hair found at the crime scene. His sentence was commuted and he was paroled sometime between 2009 and 2010.\n\n", "description": "Hwaseong Serial Killer's Confession Rattles Police", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/07/2019100701274_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
