Jaroslav Halak stopped 25 shots as Boston earned a point for the seventh straight game (5-0-2).\n\nMichael Haley, Pavel Buchnevich, Chris Kreider and Brady Skjei scored for the Rangers, who lost for the sixth time in seven games (1-5-1). Henrik Lundqvist had 27 saves before being pulled after two periods. Alexandar Georgiev finished with nine saves in the third.\n\nTrailing 1-0 after 20 minutes, the Bruins took control of the game in the second period. Pastrnak charged the net with the puck from the left side, and made contact with Lundqvist. Bergeron followed and put the puck in for his third of the season 11 seconds into the period. The goal was confirmed after a video review.\n\nMarchand put Boston ahead 57 seconds later. He got the puck in front of the net, made a backhand-forehand move before putting a backhander past Lundqvist.\n\nCoyle made it 3-1 as he got a pass across the front of the net from Charlie McAvoy, settled the puck and put it top shelf for his first at 9:27.\n\nMarchand got his second of the night with 7:51 left in the middle period, taking a pass from Coyle and whipping it past Lundqvist from the right side for his seventh. The Bruins were outshooting the Rangers 28-9 at that point.\n\nBoston finished with a 21-5 advantage on shots in the second period, and 31-12 over 40 minutes.\n\nChara made it 5-1 as he beat Georgiev with a slap shot from the blue line just 43 seconds into the third on the first shot the Rangers' backup goalie faced.\n\nBuchnevich pulled the Rangers back within three at 8:15 with his second of the season, but Bergeron's second of the night and fourth of the season restored Boston's four-goal lead with 8:21 left.\n\nKreider scored on a rebound with 1:59 left, and Skjei pulled the Rangers within two just 21 seconds later, but Bergeron's empty-netter with 45 second left capped the scoring.\n\nThe Bruins controlled play for the opening half of the first period, outshooting the Rangers 6-0. Each team had a power play during that stretch. Lundqvist made several nice stops, including a shot by Marchand that hit the goalie gloved after it hit off his chest, and an attempt by Brett Ritchie in front in the first two minutes.\n\nHowever, the Rangers got on the board on their first scoring chance. Halak stopped Brendan Smith's shot from the left side \u2014 New York's first shot on goal \u2014 but Haley charged in and knocked in the rebound with 9:41 left in the first. It was Haley's first goal since signing with the Rangers on Oct. 1.\n\nHalak had some big saves to keep it a one-goal game, stopping a tip-try by Brendan Lemieux and a follow with 7:12 left, a shot by Artemi Panarin a minute later and a backhand by Mika Zibanejad with 5:52 to go.\n\nNOTES: Marchand extended his point streak to 10 games, with seven goals and 12 assists in the stretch. He also has an assist in nine straight games. ... Pastrnak, who leads the Bruins with 11 goals, extended his point streak to nine games with 12 assists and 23 points in that stretch. ...
