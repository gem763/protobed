After a series of disastrous acquisitions and write-downs, iSentia is worth a fraction of what it was then, and now operates in a competitive market against global and home-grown competitors.\n\nOne of these is Streem, an automated (and thus rather cheap) media monitoring service set up by ex-Labor advisor Elgar Welch in 2017 which recently signed Deloitte as a client.\n\nAnd Deloitte is iSentia's auditor. For now, anyway.\n\nAnother new client of Streem's is Westpac, which joins ANZ, CBA and NAB to give the upstart firm a clean sweep of the big four banks. It also provides media monitoring services for a lot of their smaller brethren, such as the Bank of Queensland, Suncorp, ME Bank and ING.\n\nAsked about defections to rival operators in August, iSentia chief Ed Harrison told AdNews it was all part of the cut and thrust of business in a (newly) cut-throat industry.", "description": "iSentia is worth a fraction of what it was in 2014, and now operates in a competitive market against global and home-grown competitors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_26/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/403e976bdc4474f91fdd29ed47875ae2c7e248e6", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
