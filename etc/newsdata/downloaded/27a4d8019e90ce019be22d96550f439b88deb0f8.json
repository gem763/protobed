Abbott's orders come as the Lone Star State reels from two mass shootings in August that left 29 people dead.\n\n\"Texas must achieve several objectives to better protect our communities and our residents from mass shootings\" Abbott said in a statement. \"One of those objectives is to marshal law enforcement resources to stop violent criminals before they commit mass murders. But more must be done. I will continue to work expeditiously with the legislature on laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals, while safeguarding the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding Texans.\"\n\nIn a press release, Abbott's office noted that the El Paso suspect's mother had alerted authorities weeks before his shooting rampage and the Midland-Odessa gunman had called both local and federal authorities prior to that shooting. The new orders are aimed at closing what Abbott called the \"information gap\" when there is suspicion of a mass shooter.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott seen Sept. 1, 2019, in Odessa, Texas. Getty\n\nAbbott has been fending off calls for gun control by Democrats in the Texas House in the wake of the shootings. On Wednesday, 63 of the 66 Texas House Democrats signed a letter calling for a special legislative session. The proposals include \"closing the background check loopholes\" and \"banning the sale of high-capacity magazines,\" according to CBS Austin.\n\nThe Legislature does not reconvene until 2021, but Abbott tweeted Wednesday that he will announce \"legislative considerations next week.\"\n\nTexas' Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year approved a series of loosened gun laws that went into effect one day after the Midland-Odessa shooting, which left seven people dead and injured dozens more.\n\nThe laws that took effect Sunday will:\n\nAllow licensed handgun owners to carry weapons in places of worship, including churches and synagogues.\n\nBan landlords and homeowners from prohibiting tenants to own, carry and transport guns on their property.\n\nPrevent school districts from prohibiting licensed gun owners \u2014 including school employees \u2014 from storing guns and ammunition in school parking lots as long as it is not in plain view.\n\nAllow foster homes to store firearms.\n\nPrevent citizens for being charged for carrying a handgun without a license while evacuating or returning to a declared disaster zone.\n\nAllow disaster shelters to take in evacuees who have guns.\n\nAllow schools to have more armed marshals on campus.\n\nDefend licensed gun owners who unknowingly enter designated gun-free zones as long as they leave after being told about the policy.\n\nJason Silverstein contributed to this report.", "description": "The orders aim to stop potential mass shooters through strengthening reporting techniques", "authors": ["Caroline Linton"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/b5a4fdaf-1621-420e-adb4-f1ad6e0c2a71/thumbnail/1200x630/5013a7674c9e0871318df6c9182898e9/gettyimages-1165501121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
