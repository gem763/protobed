He was not introduced as a Sputnik radio host in the Fox News interview.\n\nTrump came across Kiriakou's appearance on Tucker Carlson's program Wednesday evening on Fox News. He tagged Carlson in his tweet promoting Kiriakou's position on the Ukraine whistle-blower scandal that's dogging him.\n\n'I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Whistleblower at all. I think this is an anonymous source for the Democratic Staff in the House of Representatives. This is an insult to real Whistleblowers. Actual Whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended,' he said, name-checking Kiriakou.\n\nThe statement supported Trump's own theory that the whistle-blower is a Democrat who tattled in an attempt to lower his reelection odds. He also believes that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff knows the identity of the whistle-blower and is withholding the information.\n\nSchiff says the whistle-blower approached committee staff and was directed to the appropriate channel for submitting a complaint. He claims he doesn't know the identity of the person who has been outed as a male, CIA officer with subject matter expertise.\n\nKiriakou sided with Trump in his Fox appearance and floated a new theory about the person's motivations.\n\n'I don't think this is a whistle-blower. Not at all. I think this is an anonymous source for the Democratic staff in the House of Representatives,' he said.\n\nHe said a whistle-blower must draw attention to 'waste, fraud abuse, illegality or threats to public health or public safety,' and Trump's accuser does not fit that description.\n\nThese disclosures 'almost always' come at 'great personal cost' to the person, he said.\n\n'This so called whistle-blower at the CIA, is someone who is acting anonymously, and remember, this person is not an undercover CIA operative. By all accounts, this is an analyst who is not undercover.'\n\nKiriakou contended, 'Well, you can't hide this person's name, identity, just to save him from embarrassment or trouble of being recognized, or something like that. It;s just not appropriate. If this is a whistle-blower he needs to come forward in public, testify in open session, and blow that whistle.'\n\nHe said he'd been unfairly harassed by the same law enforcement officials investigating Trump at various stages of the Russian election meddling probe.\n\nAs FBI Director Robert Mueller launched a task force to probe him; John Brennan petitioned the attorney general to charge him with five felonies and three counts of espionage; Peter Strzok put the hand cuffs on him in 2012 when he was imprisoned.\n\nThose charges were dismissed, but Kiriakou spent 23 months in prison. His claims that he was a whistle-blower were evaluated for years. The CIA claimed he was a leaker.\n\nHe said that Democrats are attempting to redefine the statute now to benefit the CIA operative who is known to be a registered Democrat.\n\n'They're imposing upon us their notion that this person is a whistle-blower, and he simply is not,' he told Carlson.\n\nThe question of a pardon never came up in the four-minute, prime-time interview, although Kiriakou has been asking for one from Trump for more than a year.", "description": "Donald Trump promoted a former CIA officer, who spent nearly two years in jail for revealing agency's 's so-called torture program, on Twitter after a television appearance -- and now the self-proclaimed whistle-blower is seeking a presidential pardon.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/17/19548234-0-image-a-19_1570725793483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
