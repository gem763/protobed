He should be sacked? Have these people got the memory of a goldfish?\n\nTottenham reached the Champions League final five months ago. Before that, their manager has taken them into the top four for the past four years.\n\nBill Nicholson is the last Spurs manager to do that.\n\nI\u2019ll struggle to support the sacking of any manager if I\u2019m honest. But I\u2019m coming around to the idea that Poch himself may be wondering if he\u2019s done his stint at the club and the time has come to move on.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nLoyalty works both ways. Poch has done a fantastic job there on limited money.\n\nHe\u2019s produced a brilliant young side and made them a real force in Europe on a net spend of around \u00a390million in five years. Man City have spent getting on for a billion in that time.\n\nI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking at the moment, but I do know there\u2019ll be far more questions inside his own head than anyone else is asking.\n\nOne of them will be, how much will paying for the new stadium affect finances? We\u2019ve seen it with Arsenal \u2013 all the time they were paying for the Emirates, they were neutered in the transfer market.\n\nIt was no coincidence Tottenham spent nothing last season when they were borrowing \u00a3700m to cover costs.\n\n(Image: Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPochettino can question the backing. They\u2019ve got three of their best players running down into the final year of their contracts, another big three 19 months away from a free.\n\nWhatever way you look at it, that tells you they\u2019re not paying the wages.\n\nI wonder if he\u2019s done what he can on that budget \u2013 built the best side possible \u2013 and losing maybe six of his regular team in the next 18 months, whether he thinks it\u2019s time for someone else to have a go?\n\nHe\u2019s taken Spurs as close as you can get without getting over that line to trophies. Sometimes, it takes that final push. I \u00adremember saying a few years ago City needed to sort out their defence to win the league under Pep Guardiola\u2026and they went out and spent hundreds of millions on \u00addefenders.\n\nLiverpool did the same with Van Dijk and Alisson. A \u00a3140m outlay was the difference, it won them the Champions League and the Reds reached the biggest points total in their history. Pochettino must look at that and wonder what he could have done with the same backing.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIf Spurs have made a \u00admistake, then it\u2019s playing hard ball with the likes of Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen. They\u2019ve missed out on the money that could have given them the final push.\n\nLike Philippe Coutinho\u2019s huge transfer fee paid by Barcelona did for Liverpool.\n\nWhat is it Kenny Rogers said? \u2018You\u2019ve got to know when to hold \u2019em, know when to fold \u2019em\u2019. That\u2019s not the manager\u2019s fault.\n\nI also get it that Spurs maybe need a manager at a different stage in his \u00adcareer too.\n\nPochettino was young and hungry and prepared to work within their financial \u00adlimitations, build a young side with an emphasis on\n\ndevelopment.\n\nHe\u2019s on a different trajectory now, but maybe Tottenham aren\u2019t.\n\nMaybe they need a young Pochettino again, someone who can work within their budget and \u00addevelop another young team, promoting from within and nurturing talent.\n\nAs I say, it works both ways. But the fact is, despite their struggles in the past few months, no one should be surprised if they go to Anfield on Sunday and win.\n\nThe past four years tell you they\u2019re \u00adcapable of that under Poch.", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino lead Tottenham to the Champions League final five months ago but has had a difficult start to the season", "authors": ["Robbie Fowler", "Image", "Pa", "Tottenham Hotspur Fc Via Getty I", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20669064.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-EUR-C1-TOTTENHAM-TRAINING.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
