Better-than-expected numbers might suggest that the impact might not be as deep as many thought.\"\n\nThe trade war between China and the United States has upset markets globally since it began more than a year ago, fanning concerns of a global economic slowdown.\n\nHowever, markets took heart from their decision to hold talks in early October in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he did not see the threat of a recession as President Donald Trump seeks to revive trade negotiations, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy. prices hold at $1,490, we might see gold steadying. However, gold's short-term trend is downward. If it breaks through $1,480, it could fall to $1,425,\" McCarthy said.\n\nInvestors now await the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday for clues on monetary policy easing. The ECB is all but certain to introduce a package of monetary easing and stimulus measures, but markets doubt it will opt for a massive quantitative easing. U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut interest rates next week.\n\n\"A resumption in U.S.-China trade talks along with accommodative monetary policy by global central banks has renewed risk appetite for the current term,\" Phillip Futures said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.82% to 882.42 tonnes on Monday. other precious metals, platinum dropped 1.2% to $935.20 per ounce, while palladium slipped to $1,542.34.
