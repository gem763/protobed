But his appearance on Wednesday night has raised hope he can make a recovery.\n\nHe will have just six months left on his deal with the club when he makes his return and boss Phillip Cocu revealed that the skipper feels 'extremely down' about the whole situation.\n\n'I've spoken to him. He was here [at the training ground] for a short moment and I spoke briefly to him because there's a lot going on,' Cocu told Sky Sports recently.\n\n'He's extremely down, of course, because he realises what's going on for him personally and of course as a responsible player, as captain, to not be part of the team any more does something to you. I think he feels responsible, yeah.\n\nKeogh will have been delighted when Graeme Shinnie scored in stoppage time against Wigan\n\n'The more senior players always have to step up and take responsibility and it's now had a huge effect on him personally. It's a lot to deal with for him.'\n\nWednesday night's dramatic late win, after Graeme Shinnie netted deep in stoppage time, will have gone some way to lifting Keogh's spirits.\n\nVictory took the Rams to 14th in the Championship and four points off the play-off places after 13 games.", "description": "Derby County captain Richard Keogh (left) has been pictured on crutches for the first time since being involved in a horror car crash that could have ended his career.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/23/20107794-0-image-a-74_1571871361392.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
