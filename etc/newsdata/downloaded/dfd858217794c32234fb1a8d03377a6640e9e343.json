(AP) \u2014 A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit that accused leaders of the Southern Poverty Law Center of trying to financially destroy one of the organizations that it has labeled as a hate group.\n\nThe Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 lawsuit is devoid of any allegation that the law center made a false statement about the Washington-based nonprofit, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., said in her ruling Friday.\n\n\u201cThe upshot of the complaint is that defendants advanced a conclusion that was debatable, and that this expression of a flawed opinion harmed plaintiff\u2019s reputation,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nThe research group accused the Montgomery, Alabama-based law center\u2019s leaders of conspiring to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act when they designated it as a hate group in 2016. The judge, however, said the suit improperly attempts to \u201cshoehorn\u201d a defamation claim into the framework of a RICO case.\n\nThe law center\u2019s attorneys asked the judge to impose monetary sanctions against the group for filing claims that it said were frivolous and designed to \u201ccensor constitutionally protected speech.\u201d The law center also argued that the First Amendment barred the suit\u2019s claims.\n\nJackson refused to impose sanctions, concluding the lawsuit wasn\u2019t \u201ccompletely frivolous.\u201d The judge also said she didn\u2019t need to rule on the law center\u2019s First Amendment arguments because she found that the suit failed to state a claim under the RICO statute.\n\nOn its website, the law center describes the Center for Immigration Studies as the \u201cgo-to think tank for the anti-immigrant movement\u201d and says it has a history of circulating the work of white nationalist and anti-Semitic writers.\n\nThe research group says on its website that it has a \u201cpro-immigrant, low-immigration vision which seeks fewer immigrants but a warmer welcome for those admitted.\u201d\n\nMark Krikorian, the group\u2019s executive director, said in an email Monday that the group hasn\u2019t yet decided whether to appeal.\n\nThe law center\u2019s interim president, Karen Baynes-Dunning, said the group stands by its listing of CIS as an anti-immigrant hate group.\n\n\u201cAs groups like CIS continue to infect the mainstream with their hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric, we will continue to call out their hate and bigotry whenever we see it,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe law center has tracked far-right extremist groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, for decades. Other organizations have sued over the law center\u2019s list of hate groups.\n\nIn January 2018, a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the First Amendment protected a charity tracking website\u2019s use of the law center\u2019s hate group labels.\n\nThe founder of the far-right Proud Boys sued the law center in February for labeling the organization as a hate group. That federal case is still pending in Alabama.\n\nIn June 2018, the law center apologized to a London-based group, Quilliam, and its founder, Maajid Nawaz, and agreed to pay $3.4 million in an out-of-court settlement after labeling them as anti-Muslim extremists.", "description": "The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Immigration Studies -- which the Southern Poverty Law Center deems a hate group -- was tossed by a federal judge.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80eda92300005805561607.jpeg?cache=wjn9swv4rb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
