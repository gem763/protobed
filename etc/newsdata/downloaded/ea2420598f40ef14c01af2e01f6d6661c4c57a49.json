As the camera panned back to reveal the scope of Richard\u2019s success, longtime viewers of Silicon Valley were treated to a satisfying ending to the show. Finally, after five seasons of trials, tribulations, and pettiness, our protagonist had finally reached the upper echelon of success, and the series had made an institution out of mocking programmers like your humble recapper. Who could ask for anything more?\n\nApparently, HBO could, and so we now have a sixth and final season for the Pied Piper crew. The probability of jumping the shark rises, but the season opener, \u201cArtificial Lack of Intelligence\u201d manages to keep Jaws at bay. One of the things I love about this show is its sense of timeliness vis-\u00e0-vis events in the real world of technology. Somehow, it always manages to speak to current events in the snarky, detailed way they deserve. So it\u2019s fitting that, on the same week Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in the real world, Richard Hendricks appears for similar reasons in the Mike Judge universe.\n\nWhenever Zuckerberg testifies, he should be studied by communication and psychology majors. Different elements of the I.T./coder personality are interspersed throughout the characters on Silicon Valley, but Zuckerberg is a concise, perfect storm of everything. He\u2019s snide, like Gilfoyle; his constant need to be right regardless of logic can be found in Dinesh; he\u2019s ruthless in a mechanical way like Professional Badass Laurie Bream, and he can be as tongue-tied as Richard when forced to deal in layman\u2019s terms rather than technical ones.\n\nMost importantly, he wears a thick air of condescension whenever speaking with someone outside the tech sphere. It\u2019s not pettiness \u2014 that\u2019s reserved for internal communications with other techies \u2014 it\u2019s a snobby sense of elevated mental entitlement. Readers of these recaps know I\u2019ve put myself on blast here many times, so I will plead guilty to all these charges as well. If you think I\u2019m picking on poor Marky Z., however, might I suggest you listen to the way he says \u201cCongresswoman\u201d or \u201cCongressman\u201d before every answer. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a Southerner saying \u201cbless your heart.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, Richard is the anti-Zuckerberg, because PiperNet rights the wrongs Facebook and Twitter are doing in regards to data collection. He\u2019s as clumsy as Zuckerberg\u2019s haircut, but he speaks to Congress with an inspirational passion rather than a defensive pose. This is unusual, for Richard is rarely able to speak so eloquently. \u201cCan I pace?\u201d he asks after initially stumbling over his words. I laughed, because any of my past and current co-workers will tell you that I pace around in my socks whenever I\u2019m trying to figure something out. Richard keeps his shoes on, but he damages government property by yanking the recording device off the table so he can move more freely. The flying wire almost hits Gavin, who\u2019s there representing the impending Hooli merger with Amazon.\n\n\u201cHe looks like a child at a custody hearing,\u201d says Gilfoyle, before Richard makes a scary case for the evils of our current Internet world. \u201cFacebook owns 80 percent of mobile social traffic,\u201d he says. \u201cGoogle owns 92 percent of search. They exploit our data for profit. They won! We lost!\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he\u2019d even testify if he already considers the battle lost, Richard draws an analogy between the \u201ctech kings\u201d like Amazon and Google and King George III, who managed to get suckered out of some land back in 1776. PiperNet is the tech representation of those scruffy colonists who scored victory against an all-powerful monarch. It was founded on the notion that they would not collect any user data, setting it apart from the evil empires whose logos pepper this show\u2019s opening credits sequence.\n\nBack at Pied Piper HQ, a party awaits their CEO upon his return from D.C. \u201cWay to punch Big Tech in the dick!\u201d screams one employee as Richard navigates his way through the crowd of cheering co-workers. Director Mike Judge employs tight framing for the office scenes, but in a few quick wide shots, he establishes just how much Richard\u2019s company has grown since its inception at Erlich Bachman\u2019s Hacker Hostel 46 episodes ago. The increased employee tally shows Richard\u2019s success. It\u2019s a bit scary as well, because I wonder if the show can maintain the close-knit intimacy of its main characters with all these other people to consider.\n\nThe show speaks to this concern through Jared. The claustrophobia inherent in Judge\u2019s framing seems to mimic Jared\u2019s emotional state. Jared misses his old role as Richard\u2019s right-hand man, and as Richard gets pulled away more and more, Jared feels lost. I\u2019ve noted many times that, despite the often horrific things Silicon Valley subjects Jared to, he\u2019s the only character in touch with his feelings, good and bad. \u201cOur resident empath,\u201d I often call him, and though I playfully tease about the sexy Jared/Richard fan fiction out there on the Internet, this episode really cements what I\u2019ve alluded to across five seasons: Richard and Jared are as close to a love story as this show will ever have. Zach Woods, this episode\u2019s MVP, really makes you feel Jared\u2019s anguish over \u201closing\u201d Richard. These feelings will eventually lead Richard\u2019s right-hand man down the dreaded \u201cleft-hand path.\u201d\n\nRemember Colin, the baseball cap-wearing gamer douche bro whose users helped save Pied Piper? Well, not only is he still in Richard\u2019s employ, his department is what\u2019s keeping Pied Piper HQ afloat monetarily. So it\u2019s a major problem when he reveals to Richard that he is collecting data from all his customers via their gamer headsets. He\u2019s recording everything they say, even if they\u2019re not playing a game. \u201cI\u2019m not using this to sell ads,\u201d he says, alluding to what Facebook, Twitter, and your favorite gossip girls Alexa and Siri are doing. Regardless, this goes against PiperNet\u2019s defining principle. But fellow board members Monica, Gilfoyle, and Dinesh are willing to let it slide because, without Colin, PiperNet goes bankrupt.\n\nSpeaking of bankrupt, Hooli will most certainly go under if they don\u2019t accept Amazon\u2019s offer to merge. Gavin is fine with this arrangement despite his undying hatred for Jeff Bezos. But when Bezos wants to retire the Hooli name, Gavin has one of his usual freakouts and decides to go private. Unfortunately, his budget won\u2019t allow it, something he\u2019d have known had he bothered to look at the agreement made by his soon-to-be-ex business partner. Hooli is so broke now that it has to sublet space from restaurant El Pollo Loco, whose enormous new sign does to their building\u2019s Hooli logo what El Pollo Loco does to your colon.\n\nMeanwhile, this week\u2019s Gilfoyle vs. Dinesh subplot features deception by artificial intelligence. Dinesh is happily chatting away with Gilfoyle on Slack, complaining about Gabe, a weird new guy on Dinesh\u2019s team. Gabe likes padding around barefoot, has a seat attached to his ass so he can sit down anywhere, and is so lazy he asks Dinesh to resend him emails so he doesn\u2019t have to look for their originals in his inbox. (I cop to doing that last one myself.) He\u2019s uber-needy\u2014kinda like Dinesh! \u201cI hate him,\u201d types Dinesh to Gilfoyle. \u201cI hate you,\u201d responds Gilfoyle expectedly.\n\nOr is it Gilfoyle? While Slacking with him, Dinesh notices Gilfoyle\u2019s magical ability to simultaneously be typing at his desk and at the pantry. Slack Gilfoyle is a bot! When Dinesh complains that Gilfoyle needs to create an A.I. version of himself because he hates human interaction, Gilfoyle asks \u201cdo you need the real me for this conversation?\u201d Suddenly, Dinesh gets the idea to have a fake version of him created to deal with obnoxious, barefoot, seat-on-butt Gabe. Much to our surprise, Gilfoyle creates one for him using his new compression and inference API, Son of Anton. \u201cIt\u2019s an homage to an old friend,\u201d says Gilfoyle of the name, alluding to the server that sadly gave its life in season four\u2019s finale. Unfortunately, Dinesh decides to use A.I. Dinesh to communicate with everybody, including A.I. Gilfoyle. Fun with Endless Loops ensues!\n\nSon of Anton also plays a big part in Richard\u2019s attempt to blackmail Colin, an attempt warily approved by a Jared desperate for Richard\u2019s approval. In two hours, Son of Anton indexes all Colin\u2019s own recordings, especially the ones where you can hear him jerking off, snorting cocaine, swindling Pied Piper, and sleeping with one of his board member\u2019s wives. This makes Gilfoyle\u2019s API a fantastic tool for data mining. Unfortunately, Colin reveals this to his board members, all of whom are excited about how great PiperNet\u2019s new data collection feature will be. As usual, walking the left-hand path backfires for Richard.\n\nVULTURE NEWSLETTER Keep up with all the drama of your favorite shows!
