They both challenged the Trudeau government's approach to protecting Canada's ocean and coastal areas.\n\nOrrell said the plan to restrict access to ocean waters \"will negatively impact fish harvesters in Nova Scotia who depend on the fishery to support their families and their communities.\"\n\n\"We will repeal Liberal measures that bypass community consultation for our MPAs to ensure that the voices of coastal communities are no longer ignored,\" said MacLeod.\n\nOne of the Conservative's priorities is reducing how often wild and farmed salmon come in contact. (CBC)\n\nHe also said the Conservatives would \"work with international partners to reduce the prevalence of ghost gear,\" or abandoned fishing gear, which he said contributes to the world's plastics problem and entangles marine life.\n\nIn August, the Liberal government annouced it would spend $8.3 million in an effort to rid Canadian waters of abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear.\n\nPlan unveiled across Canada\n\nOther similar events were held in St. Martins, N.B., West Point, P.E.I., and Holyrood, N.L., with local Conservative candidates, as well as in communities in British Columbia.\n\nIn Newfoundland, candidates Terry Martin and Matthew Chapman delivered many of the same remarks \u2014 word for word \u2014 when they addressed people at the wharf in Holyrood.\n\nChapman said he frequently hears from fish harvesters who say decisions are being made without their input. But he struggled to answer specific questions about the fisheries plan, at one point telling reporters he was a teacher and the fishery wasn't his expertise.\n\n\"It's very important for us to consult with people who this is their livelihood,\" he said.\n\nFrom left to right: Conservative candidates Joedy Wall, who is running in St. John\u2019s East; Terry Martin, running in St. John\u2019s South\u2013Mount Pearl; and Matthew Chapman, who is running Avalon. (CBC)\n\nThe party's fisheries plan also includes commitments to:\n\nCreate advisory panels made up of fish harvesters, anglers, Indigenous groups and other experts to discuss rebuilding fish stocks.\n\nWork with industry on a strategy to prevent seafood fraud.\n\nSupport technology and practices that aim to keep wild and farmed salmon apart.\n\nRebuild wild Atlantic and Pacific salmon stocks through the Salmonid Enhancement Program and partnerships with community groups.\n\nIncrease how much non-residents pay for the Salmon Conservation Stamp and put that money toward the Pacific Salmon Foundation.\n\nFinish recovery plans for critical fisheries, including how to manage predator and invasive species.\n\nThe Liberals are entering the election having held all 32 seats in Atlantic Canada since 2015.\n\nAlfie MacLeod, Conservative candidate for Cape Breton-Canso, said Nova Scotians understand the importance of keeping fish stocks healthy. (Tom Ayers/CBC)\n\nTracy Murphy, who has fished for lobster out of Glace Bay for 16 years, went to her community's announcement to hear about the candidates' plans.\n\n\"There's a lot going on in the industry that we could use help with, or more knowledge of,\" she said. \"The part where [MacLeod said] he's going to Ottawa for Cape Breton and not going to be Ottawa's voice in Cape Breton, that means something, hopefully.\"\n\nMurphy said the only time she saw outgoing Liberal MP Rodger Cuzner at the Glace Bay Harbour was when he was first elected. He held his seat for 19 years, but Murphy said she \"kind of felt abandoned.\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, she said she remained undecided.\n\n\"Usually, I understand a little more where I'm going to put my vote. This year, it just seems like I don't know. Maybe I'm disheartened after the last Liberal stint,\" she said.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "Conservative candidates at separate events in\u00a0Atlantic Canada on Sunday unveiled the party's plans to support the fisheries and to try to build consensus on how to restore fish stocks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311054.1570382428!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/alfie-macleod-left-lisa-raitt-middle-and-alfie-macleod.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
