But as evidence for impeachment mounts (the recent developments about China and Syria are important), and as Trump continues to spiral out of control rhetorically, I\u2019ve started believing there is at least a chance that 20 of the 53 Republican senators could vote to convict.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine the first defector. It\u2019s Mitt Romney, of course, who has already been outspoken about Trump\u2019s behavior. Breaking the seal, so to speak, is vital. As Michael Tomasky writes, \u201cRomney\u2026 might embolden a few of his Senate colleagues whose desertion from the Trump ranks will make a difference. In fact, that may be a job, persuading other Republicans to speak out, that only he can do.\u201d\n\nSomeone has to jump into the freezing swimming pool first, and that job probably belongs to Romney. Then, if it looks like the pool is warmer than suspected, others may take the plunge.", "description": "Yes, they\u2019ve all been big fraidy-cats.
