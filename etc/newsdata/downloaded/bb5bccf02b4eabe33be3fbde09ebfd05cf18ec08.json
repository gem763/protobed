When the matter of the normal star, driven by the strong gravitation, falls into a black hole or neutron star, it is accelerated and heated during the process, emitting strong X-rays, said Lu.\n\n\"We call them X-ray binary systems, which are regarded as natural laboratories of extreme physical conditions,\" said Lu.\n\nScientists study many phenomena that they cannot replicate on Earth by observing such systems and might learn more about the characteristics of black holes and neutron stars from the X-rays.\n\nThe HXMT has found a quasi-periodic change of the high energy X-rays emitted by the matter near black holes and neutron stars, Lu said.\n\nCompared with X-ray astronomical satellites of other countries, HXMT has a larger detection area, broader energy range and more effective working time. These give it advantages in observing black holes and neutron stars emitting bright X-rays, according to Lu.\n\nDuring its over two-year operation in orbit, the telescope has conducted more than 1,000 observations, sending back 2TB of scientific data. The satellite was also used to search for gamma-ray bursts corresponding to gravitational waves and test pulsar navigation.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/27/5db4df75a310cf3e97a3173b.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
