Apple mentioned the news on its website and included a portrait mode photo of a dog taken with the iPhone 11 in its press release.\n\nApple \"Yay, pets!\" Apple's Kaiann Drance said after announcing that the iPhone 11 could take portrait mode photos of pets.\n\nBut wait, you might be thinking, some iPhones could already take portrait mode of pets. Indeed, some people on Twitter noted as much by sharing their own images of pet portrait shots taken with their iPhones.\n\nSo here's what's going on. The iPhone 11 is the new version of the iPhone XR, which specifically couldn't take portrait mode photos of pets, and even objects. It was discovered shortly after it was released in 2018 that the iPhone XR \u2014 limited by its single camera lens \u2014 could only take portrait mode photos of people.\n\nLike the iPhone X and iPhone XS, which could take portrait mode photos of pets and other objects, the iPhone 11 has a dual-lens-camera system that affords it stereoscopic depth, making it capable of recognizing different pet and object shapes.\n\nRead more: Here's everything Apple announced at its big iPhone 11 event.\n\nThe iPhone 11's second camera lens is an ultrawide camera that works with the regular camera, as well as Apple's \"semantic rendering,\" to allow the iPhone 11 to \"more reliably detect subjects,\" Drance said.\n\nSo there you have it. Pet portrait mode photos are new for Apple's cheaper iPhone offering.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "The iPhone 11 has a dual-lens camera system, compared to the iPhone XR's single camera lens, which lets the iPhone 11 take pet portrait mode photos.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7902a02e22af34432ef504-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
