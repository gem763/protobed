An official told The Post on Thursday morning that authorities aren\u2019t sure yet whether those harboring the fugitives were gang members. Blane Barksdale, 56, is allegedly affiliated with the groups, the Marshals said.\n\nMore information is expected to be released at a Thursday morning news conference.\n\nThe Barksdales escaped custody on Aug. 26 while being extradited more than 2,000 miles from Rochester, N.Y., back to Pima County, Ariz., to face the murder charges.\n\nThe couple allegedly fled to New York after killing 72-year-old Frank Bligh in Tucson in April. Police said they may have stolen a cache of nearly 100 guns before setting fire to his house, causing an explosion. Once the U.S. Marshals tracked down the couple and arrested them in New York, a private security contractor was hired to bring them back to Tucson.\n\nThings went terribly wrong.\n\nIn the small town of Blanding, Utah, Susan Barksdale, 59, pretended she was having \u201cintestinal issues\u201d and badly needed to go to the bathroom, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said. \u201cIt was compelling enough that they felt the need to pull over,\u201d he said.\n\nBut once the two unarmed guards opened the back door, the Barksdales attacked, he said. Despite the fact that they were restrained with belly chains, they managed to overpower the two guards, tie them up and lock them in the back of the vehicle. A third inmate who had been picked up in Kansas City was also in the van, but wanted \u201cnothing to do with\u201d the Barksdales\u2019 escape plan, Gonzales said.\n\nThe Barksdales took the van and headed for Vernon, Ariz., a town so small it doesn\u2019t have a police force. There, the couple pulled up to an acquaintance\u2019s house and took a red GMC Sierra pickup truck. One of the Barksdales drove the truck while the other continued to drive the prison van \u2014 until abandoning it in the middle of the high desert, with the three victims still locked inside, Gonzales said.\n\nAfter several hours, the trio managed to break free. The Barksdales left behind the car keys, and so the guards called 911 \u2014 having no idea where they were \u2014 and followed the operator\u2019s directions to the Apache County Sheriff\u2019s Office in St Johns, Ariz.\n\nBy the time authorities realized the Barksdales had fled, they already had an eight-hour head start.\n\nNews of their escape flashed across TV screens and on highway signs, as the Marshals urged millions of Arizona drivers to be on the lookout for the Sierra pickup. In Blanding, a town of about 3,600, authorities were so worried that the local high school volleyball team was sent home early, the sheriff told AP.\n\nOf course, the outlaws were long gone. Hundreds of people called in believing they had seen the Sierra pickup, Gonzales, said, but none panned out. \u201cIt literally just disappeared off the face of the earth,\u201d Gonzales said of the truck on Monday.\n\nHe said at a Monday news conference that the Marshals were changing their strategy, after a fruitless search for the couple for two weeks. Based on tips they\u2019d received, the Marshals believed the Barksdales were hiding out somewhere east of Snowflake, Ariz., an isolated enclave where dozens have gone to live off the grid, some of whom believe they suffer from environmental illnesses that make it impossible for them to live in populated areas among pollution and technology.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Barksdales were found in Tonto Basin, about 115 miles southeast of Snowflake.\n\nThe Marshals have not revealed what led them to the couple.\n\nIn Pima County, the Barksdales are facing charges of first-degree murder, arson, burglary and auto theft. Blane Barksdale\u2019s nephew, Brent Mallard, 31, was also charged with arson in that case and remains in custody in Pima County.\n\nBligh had vanished about one week before the fire at his home. His brother reported him missing the same day of the fire, according to the Tucson Police Department, although the home was not occupied at the time it was set. His body has still not been found.", "description": "Blane and Susan Barksdale were found after overpowering two guards in a prison van and leaving the guards and one other inmate locked inside, authorities say.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
