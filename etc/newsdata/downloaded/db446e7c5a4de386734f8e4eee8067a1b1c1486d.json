Cue reality:\n\nGold settled Friday at 1493.4 ... we're noting the \".4\" such as to differentiate price from where 'twas a week ago at 1493.5 ... and thus Gold posted a net loss for the week of one li'l ole trading pip, i.e. -10\u00a2. Moreover, (or perhaps better stated, \"lessover\"), Gold's trading range for the entire week was 22 points, not even that \"expected\" for a single day let alone for five of 'em combined. From high (1503.0) to low (1480.6), the -1.5% swing was seventh narrowest this year-to-date, indeed the narrowest week since that ending 24 May, in turn sporting the narrowest net change (that one pip) for a full week since that ending 30 August 2013. Where'd all the excitement go? Who turned out the lights?\n\n'Course fundamentally -- beyond Turkish/Syrian battling (where at the moment they're at \"halftime\"), StateSide Presidential impeaching, Parliamentary Brexit voting (to again delay), global economic data weakening, and renewed Federal Reserve Bank U.S Treasury Bills buying -- there's really nuthin' goin' on out there. (Please put Gold back in the relics attic next to that pile of Uncle Egbert's indestructible polyester pants).\n\n'Course technically, what just happened with Gold?\n\n\"Back-to-back inside weeks, mmb?\"\n\nSpot-on Squire. Gold just again sported both a \"lower high\" and a \"higher low\", which for two weeks in-a-row is quite rare, this being just the fifth such consecutive occurrence since the turn-of-the-century. And save for such first docile occurrence back in 2001, each subsequent set of back-to-back inside weeks has acted as a coiled spring in then shooting Gold to materially higher levels.\n\nSo with ten full trading weeks still to run in 2019, let's compare Gold's pricing ten weeks beyond the coiled springs of the those prior rare consecutive inside weeks: in 2002, price went from 279 up to 308 (+10%); in 2008 price went from 734 up to 892 (+21%); and in 2013 price went from 1093 up to 1191 (+9%). So should history repeat itself and Gold spring forth from here by, say, 10% before year's end, 'twould see 1642! (Be thee not too quick to place Gold in the relics attic, just in case...)\n\nAs to Gold's present case, let's update our graphic of its closing prices by the \"100-Handle\" groupings since settling at the highest ever --1900-- back on 22 August 2011. And therein, \"The Gap\" remains obvious with 1600 waiting in the wings per the albeit arguable trader's theorem that \"all gaps get filled\". Brings to mind for you blues rockers out there the super-charged John Mayall piece from '69: \"Room to Move\":\n\nGold Trading Days\n\nHowever more to the present, Gold remains in its corrective parabolic Short trend, now five weeks in length, price therein having traded as low as 1465 (01 October), but not so deep as to test the 1454-1434 support shelf. Yet as narrow as was this past week's trading range, pressing deeply down on a coiled spring only becomes exponentially more difficult, (barring the spring itself suffering catastrophic structural failure):\n\nWeekly Gold Bars & Parabolic Trends\n\n\"Failure\" indeed seems more apropos for the recent track of our Economic Barometer, such stance ought being favourable for Gold. Further, look at the graphical expanse between the level of the S&P 500 (red line) which historically has always moved to the level of the Baro (blue line). And 'twasn't the prettiest week for incoming metrics: October's Philly Fed Index halved itself from 12.0 to 5.6; and September posted negative reads for Industrial Production of -0.4%, Retail Sales of -0.3%, and Leading Indicators of -0.1%. Yes, various near-term technical trends for Gold also show as negative, but 'tis its buoyancy therein that counts, luv:\n\nEconomic Barometer\n\nIndeed to trends we go, these next two of course from the website's Market Trends page. Here we've the daily bars across the last three months-to-date for Gold on the left and Silver on the right. To be sure, in both panels the baby blue dots of linear regression trend consistency are pointing to further price fallout. But given all of the aforementioned fundamental and economic Gold positives presently afoot, the rightmost price bars of both the yellow and white metals at worst look not so much negative as do they namby-pamby:\n\nGold Silver Dots\n\nThus it follows next within the 10-day Market Profiles for Gold ( below left ) and Silver ( below right) that we find their respective present prices centered, or nearly so:\n\nGold Silver Profiles\n\nAnd certainly centered in the broad case of The Stack is \"Gold Currently\" at 1493:\n\nThe Gold Stack\n\nGold's Value per Dollar Debasement, (from our opening \"Scoreboard\"): 2972\n\nGold\u2019s All-Time High: 1923 (06 September 2011)\n\nThe Gateway to 2000: 1900+\n\nGold\u2019s All-Time Closing High: 1900 (22 August 2011)\n\nThe Final Frontier: 1800-1900\n\nThe Northern Front: 1750-1800\n\nOn Maneuvers: 1579-1750\n\n2019's High: 1566 (04 September)\n\nThe Weekly Parabolic Price to flip Long: 1553\n\n10-Session \u201cvolume-weighted\u201d average price magnet: 1498\n\nTrading Resistance: 1495 / 1513\n\nGold Currently: 1493, (expected daily trading range [\"EDTR\"]: 21 points)\n\nTrading Support: 1489\n\n10-Session directional range: down to 1478 (from 1522) = -44 points or -2.9%\n\nThe Floor: 1466-1579\n\nLe Sous-sol: Sub-1466\n\nBase Camp: 1377\n\nThe 1360s Double-Top: (1362 in Sep '17 and 1369 in Apr '18)\n\nThe 300-Day Moving Average: 1325 and rising\n\nNeverland: The Whiny 1290s\n\nThe Box: 1280-1240\n\n2019's Low: 1267 (02 May)\n\n'Tis clear that Gold has put in a solid year. Upon achieving our \"aggressive\" forecast high so far of 1526 on 12 August, price was +18.8 year-to-date. Then following the typical technical overshoot, price rotated about that 1526 level so much so that we dubbed it the \"centerpiece\" price. But should the coiled spring lead to 1600 being tapped by year's end, 'twould be a year-to-date run of +24.5%. Possible? In 2009 Gold's net yearly change was indeed +24.5%. As well, in 2002 'twas +24.8%, in 2010 +29.5%, and in 2007 +31.2%. Possible! How lovely 'twould be to be wrong about our 1526 forecast high for this year.
