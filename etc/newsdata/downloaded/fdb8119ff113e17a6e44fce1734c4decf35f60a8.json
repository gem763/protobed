In 2016, population density was a better predictor of how that community voted than its total population, income, racial diversity, or share of college grads.\n\nFor Democrats, rural losses make the challenge of winning the Senate and the Electoral College even tougher. Here\u2019s one way of thinking about it: The population of Los Angeles County alone is larger than all but 9 states (that get two Senators each).\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nWhat Else We\u2019re Watching\n\n(Scott Morgan / Reuters)\n\nGeorge Conway has a few words to say about President Donald Trump\u2019s fitness for office: \u201cNo president in recent memory\u2014and likely no president ever\u2014has prompted more discussion about his mental stability and connection with reality.\u201d He lays out his comprehensive argument here.\n\nAt a recent press conference with the Finnish president, Trump skirted around an odd word: jockstrap. Our resident linguist examines why the president, usually not one to self-censor, restrained himself when it came to this one odd word.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s over-reliance on secrecy invites abuse, Mike Giglio reports: \u201c[T]oo much national-security information\u2014from the trivial to the politically inconvenient\u2014gets labeled \u2018confidential,\u2019 \u2018secret,\u2019 or \u2018top secret,\u2019 meaning that only those with the corresponding government clearance can access it.\u201d But one of the consequences of overclassification? Potential scandals escaping notice.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said on the White House South Lawn today, \u201cbecause what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d David Graham parses.\n\nFeatured Read\n\n(JABIN BOTSFORD / THE WASHINGTON POST VIA GETTY / SHUTTERSTOCK / KLARA AUERBACH / THE ATLANTIC)\n\nHave you heard of Pat Cipollone? You\u2019ll want to remember his name\u2014he may be sticking around awhile.\n\nOur White House reporters Elaina Plott and Peter Nicholas spoke with multiple current and former senior administration officials, from the Attorney General William Barr to senior advisor Jared Kushner for their profile of the White House lawyer:\n\nIn his 10 months in the administration, the 53-year-old Cipollone seems to have earned the president\u2019s trust in a way that few aides have done. He is both discreet, and more to the point, clear in his admiration for the president. He is not the sort of lawyer who will refer to the president as \u201cKing Kong,\u201d as his predecessor, Don McGahn, once did.\n\n\u2192 Read the rest\n\nOur Reporters Are Also Reading\n\n\u2023 They\u2019re Retired.
