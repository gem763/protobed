Although the daily news cycle seems to be boxing the president\u2019s defenders into a corner, it may also be his key to reviving his Southern base for the election in November.\n\nThe transformation of the South from one-party blue to red took 50 years. After the 1960\u2019s civil rights movement, Southern whites who identified as Democrat dropped almost 50 points.\n\nIn a long evolution \u2014 through George Wallace and reaction to African American voter enfranchisement; the Reagan realignment; the politicization of the Southern evangelical church; Newt Gingrich Newton (Newt) Leroy GingrichMORE\u2019s Contract with America; and the Tea Party revolt of 2010 \u2014 analysts saw the Republican Party becoming the party of the South.\n\nToday, there\u2019s a red wall in the United States Senate, where the 11 states of the Confederacy plus neighboring Oklahoma, West Virginia and Kentucky give Republicans a 24-to-4 advantage before a single seat is contested outside the region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhich brings us to this year\u2019s November elections in three Southern states that Trump won easily in 2016.\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevins, until recently, was the most unpopular incumbent in the nation after battling public school teachers and the state legislature. He is now facing the Democratic attorney general, Andy Beshear, the son of a popular former governor.\n\nIn Mississippi, Jim Hood, a four-term attorney general, the only statewide elected Democrat, is vying with incumbent Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who was wounded by a brutal primary fight. Hood is a conservative who cleans his guns and drives a pickup to church in his ads.\n\nIn Louisiana, Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has navigated between reversing his predecessor\u2019s deep tax cuts to restore educational funding and expand Medicaid, while signing anti-abortion legislation.\n\nTrump\u2019s response is to fight back, barnstorming all three states to ratchet up the anger of his base over impeachment and get out the vote in notoriously low-turnout off-year elections. And each of the GOP candidates is likewise seizing on impeachment.\n\nBevins recently called a news conference on his Capitol steps, daring his opponent to say whether he supported impeachment, as state pundits noted a tightening of the polls as GOP voters return to the fold because of their anger over the impeachment hearings.\n\nIn Louisiana, Trump claimed his recent rally there forced Gov. Edwards into a runoff against a wealthy Republican businessman, Eddie Rispone. Rispone is already out with new ads accusing Edwards of being part of a witch hunt.\n\nIn Mississippi, the state GOP is getting ready for a presidential visit before Election Day, a development that Democrats, already a beleaguered minority party, dread.\n\nWatch any of the president\u2019s recent rallies and the heated rhetoric aimed at the impeachment process in Washington seems to reach new levels with every campaign trip. And there is evidence that it does gin up the base. A Trump rally in Fayetteville, N.C., before the recent special congressional election helped increase GOP turnout significantly in a close Republican wins.\n\nMaybe this is overreaction. Virginia may turn its legislature blue in November, driven by the issue of gun control. And who knows what the next surreal news cycle will bring. But if impeachment turns out to be Trump\u2019s key for reviving his Southern base, then this November could serve as a cautionary tale for those who assume impeachment is the last straw for the Trump presidency in 2020.\n\nPaul Stekler is a documentary filmmaker and the Wofford Denius chair in Entertainment Studies at The University of Texas at Austin.", "description": "Although the daily news cycle seems to be boxing the president\u2019s defenders into a corner, it may also be his key to reviving his Southern base for the election in November.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonaldlouisianarally4_101119screenshot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
