The first, with gold braid on his cap, ignored him, Hicks told the court.\n\nAsked by Christine Agnew QC, for the prosecution, about the second officer, he said he shouted to the officer to do something.\n\n\u201cHe basically swore at me,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cHe told me to \u2018shut my fucking prattle\u2019. Which I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nHicks said of the initial police response to the crush: \u201cThe whole reaction was one of containment rather than assistance.\u201d\n\nThe Hicks family had also gone to Hillsborough the previous year, 1988, for the semi-final played between the same two clubs. On that occasion, he recalled, police manned two separate positions to check that people had tickets before they were allowed to proceed towards the Leppings Lane turnstiles.\n\nIn 1989, at the match commanded by Duckenfield, Hicks said there were no police checks for tickets on the approach to the turnstiles.\n\nJenni Hicks had a ticket to sit, while he and his daughters had tickets for the Leppings Lane terrace. He said once inside the girls \u201cdumped\u201d him to go to watch the match with friends.\n\n\u201cOne of my last clear images of them was looking over their shoulders giving me a bit of a grin \u2013 in other words, they were giving their old man the slip,\u201d Hicks told the jury.\n\nShortly after 3pm, Hicks saw Vicki being carried over a fence. He made his way down to the pitch and found his two daughters there, laid out next to each other.\n\nHe confirmed to Agnew that he and other men worked on giving the girls mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and he then went in an ambulance with Vicki, believing Sarah would follow in another ambulance, although she did not.\n\nAt the hospital, Vicki was confirmed to have died. Her body was then taken back to the football ground and placed in the gymnasium. \u201cYes, something we didn\u2019t agree with,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that was done.\u201d\n\nAfter he and Jenni met up, it \u201ctook some time\u201d to establish where Sarah was, before they found out she was at the gymnasium. There they were told she too had died.\n\nHe and Jenni then drove back from Sheffield to London. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have driven home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were told the girls were the property of the coroner, we wouldn\u2019t be able to see them or touch them or anything else. So we went home.\u201d\n\nDuckenfield has pleaded not guilty to causing the deaths by gross negligence manslaughter of 95 of those who died.
