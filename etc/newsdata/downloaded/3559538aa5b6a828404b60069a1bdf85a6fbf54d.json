It would follow back-to-back rate cuts in June and July that took the policy rate to a record low of 1%.\n\nThe RBA is closely watching the jobs data as it is counting on labor market strength for a long-awaited pick up in wage growth and inflation. The RBA has said it would like to see the unemployment rate fall to around 4.5% to help generate wage pressures.\n\nThat looks like a tall task as the unemployment rate has been nudging higher since it touched 4.9% in February. One reason why unemployment has been rising is more people are looking for work, with labor force participation rising to a record high of 66.2% in August, up from 65.6% a year earlier.\n\nThe figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed part-time employment rose by 50,200 in August while full-time employment contracted.\n\nEconomists and investors widely expect another cut later this year, and some are predicting the policy rate at 0.5% or lower in 2020 as the RBA steps up efforts to revive growth in Australia's A$1.95 trillion economy which has slowed to decade lows.", "description": "Data showed 34,700 jobs were created in July, more than three times what the market had expected, although full-time employment fell by 15,500 and measures of underemployment and under-utilization edged up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104707098-GettyImages-800655588.jpg?v=1568859495", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
