The ball just runs away from him, he dives at it and it\u2019s a shocking tackle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Absolutely brilliant showing the crowd, there\u2019s no complaints here from the Southampton fans, no booing.\u2019\n\nSouthampton fans were booing later in the game as they found themselves 5-0 behind to the Foxes at half-time.\n\nMORE: James Maddison urged to ignore Man Utd advances and stay at Leicester by Paul Robinson\n\nMORE: Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino \u2018more than agrees\u2019 with Roy Keane on Harry Kane", "description": "Mike Dean has earned praise for his VAR work after Southampton's Ryan Bertrand was sent off against Leicester in the Premier League on Friday night.
