Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan acknowledged recently that domestic terrorism was becoming a priority \u201cfor the first time.\u201d\n\nThis is a much-needed change. Domestic terrorism \u2014 such as the mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, Pittsburgh and Orlando \u2014 bears similarities to international terrorism and to more conventional criminal matters. Domestic extremists are as resilient and adaptive as al Qaeda. Many law enforcement tactics used against criminals can be effective against domestic terrorists.\n\nDomestic terrorism nonetheless presents unique challenges. Specifically, confronting domestic terrorism creates challenges related to popular perceptions and public opinion. Israel also faces both domestic and external terrorist threats. We hear a lot about Israel\u2019s conflict with certain Arab groups, but Israel also has confronted violent Jewish extremists. In the 1990s, a Jewish extremist assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and another massacred 29 Muslims. More recently, Jewish extremists have burned a family in the West Bank and committed scores of other attacks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat can the U.S. learn from Israel\u2019s experience? The ongoing HBO series \u201cOur Boys\u201d examines Israel\u2019s struggles with the specific political challenges of countering domestic extremists.\n\nThe show dramatizes events surrounding the 2014 murder of Palestinian teenager Muhammed Abu Khdeir. In the prior weeks, three Jewish teenagers were kidnapped and later found murdered. The public reaction in Israel was heated, with thousands gathering for mass prayers and, after the bodies were discovered, extremists calling for payback. In that highly charged setting, Abu Khdeir\u2019s murderers saw his killing as an act of revenge.\n\nThis set of events highlights three ways in which combating domestic terrorism presents distinct challenges, particularly in terms of public opinion.\n\nThe first is the problem of rationalization. When outsiders attack, the threat fits neatly into an easily understood \u201cus v. them\u201d mindset. Government and media tend to portray the perpetrators as \u201cbad guys\u201d and the public generally accepts this narrative.\n\nNot so when the threat is from within. When that happens, individuals seek other explanations, which some psychologists argue is a mechanism to overcome the discomfort of cognitive dissonance. After the Hebron massacre, some in Israel convinced themselves the perpetrator acted to preempt an attack against Jews. In the United States, rationalizations such as flaws in the mental health system or the influence of violent video games enter the public discourse after domestic extremist attacks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA second challenge is the potential stigmatizing of law enforcement officials focused on domestic threats. When a country faces attacks from outsiders, those tasked with fighting internal threats are sometimes viewed as doing a less important job at best, and ostracized at worst, although it is likely also the case that many in our law enforcement community are eager for a stronger mandate to engage domestic extremists.\n\nIn \u201cOur Boys,\u201d Simon, the fictional Israeli official tasked with monitoring Jewish extremists, pressures an informant to find out if anyone is planning a retaliation for the kidnappings. The informant is shocked that the conversation is even taking place. Simon and his team, he believes, waste resources on hypothetical threats while the rest of the country tries to find the kidnapped boys.\n\nThe scene is fictional, but this perception is real. When someone such as the El Paso shooter is portrayed as a pathetic figure, a member of an underclass leading \u201cpurposeless lives of anonymity and digital dependency,\u201d we wonder what impact this characterization might have on the motivation, self-esteem and social standing of those tasked with fighting him, especially when less controversial and more prestigious external threats abound.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the problem of misattribution. Abu Khdeir was murdered by lone wolves. Yet many Palestinians misperceived the murder as a sinister and especially shocking case of Israeli violence \u2014 if not directly organized by authorities, then at least encouraged by them. This is not surprising in the context of decades of conflict and mistrust. As our statistical analysis of data provided by the Israeli police shows, this misperception contributed to a tenfold spike in riots in Jerusalem.\n\nThis is a common misperception. The government can state that it was not involved, but members of targeted groups may not believe this. The El Paso and Pittsburgh shooters were correctly perceived by the targeted communities as individual, unaffiliated actors, but many people still attributed some responsibility to the Trump administration. It can be especially difficult for the government to distance itself from domestic terrorists.\n\nTaking domestic terrorism in the United States more seriously is long overdue. Law enforcement institutions, both in Israel and the U.S., are not equipped to take these public opinion considerations into account, and we hope the ongoing efforts within the government begin to consider how best to do so. It certainly would be helpful if our elected officials refrained from inflammatory rhetoric against certain groups.\n\nIn the meantime, however, there is much the media and we, as a public, can do to address these challenges. We must change how we talk about these attacks. Attributing individual actions to broader groups is common and, some believe, deeply embedded in human psychology. But we can mitigate this by de-emphasizing the attacker\u2019s ethnic or religious identity. Also, the El Paso and Orlando attackers are either both \u201cshooters\u201d or both \u201cterrorists.\u201d We should choose the right words and stick to them, regardless of the perpetrator\u2019s identity.\n\nFinally, if we seek answers as to why our culture leads some white men to commit attacks, we must equally focus on why some minorities and even Islamists turn to such desperate acts.\n\nSuch changes in our public discourse would help in several ways \u2014 by bringing the needed moral clarity and curbing rationalizations; by preventing the stigmatization of law enforcement; and by sending a powerful message to targeted communities that the government is firmly on their side. Law enforcement alone cannot address all the challenges of violent domestic extremism. As a society, we can help by choosing our words carefully.\n\nEugene Finkel is an associate professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
