With hearing aids, Savannah can hear at a moderate level. He said her ability to interpret songs with such emotion is truly remarkable for her age. She studies the songs' lyrics, so she can get the timing right, he said.\n\n\"She can convey that emotion and the intensity of the music that matches her expression with her body language, and her facial expression matches the tone,\" he said.\n\nSavannah continues to share her talents on social media, creating and posting videos of her moving ASL to music.\n\nSavannah Dahan has captured hearts everywhere with her expressive and emotional signing to music.
