Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for spending $300 at a hair salon. Many people on Twitter defended her, saying the outlet doesn't understand how expensive women's haircuts are.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) served up a bit of sass in response to a news article that criticized her for spending $300 on a haircut.\n\nOn Wednesday, the freshman congresswoman was targeted by conservative news outlet The Washington Times in an article titled \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Self-declared socialist AOC splurges on high-dollar hairdo.\u201d The piece explained that Ocasio-Cortez \u201cspent nearly $300 on her hairdo\u201d at the Last Tangle Salon in Washington, D.C., last month.\n\nThe article went on to say that she \u201cshelled out $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights\u201d and that a \u201c20% tip would have added $52 to the bill.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why hair maintenance would be news. The outlet also clearly does not understand how much it costs for a woman to get her hair done in America, as it quoted the president of Americans for Limited Government, Richard Manning, calling Ocasio-Cortez \u201cthe Eva Peron of American politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe preaches socialism while living the life of the privileged,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with spending money to make yourself look better, especially as a personality who depends upon visual mediums for her power. But it is a bad look to spend hundreds of dollars to get your hair done to make a video decrying income inequality.\u201d\n\nDemocratic socialist publication Jacobin tweeted about the article, quipping that it\u2019s sad to see democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u201cdo things like buy winter coats and get haircuts.\u201d\n\nSad to see democratic socialists like Bernie and @AOC do things like buy winter coats and get haircuts.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t they know that real socialists avoid purchasing goods and services? https://t.co/iXSpu3rwjS \u2014 Jacobin (@jacobinmag) October 10, 2019\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Jacobin\u2019s missive about the article with some statistics about poverty in America and how the policies of democratic socialists are not to blame.\n\n\u201cOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They\u2019re just mad we look good doing it,\u201d she wrote, accompanied by a hair toss emoji.\n\n40 million Americans live in poverty under today\u2019s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures.\n\n\n\nOur policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re just mad we look good doing it \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/l9gKGtyKra \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nMany people on Twitter were incredulous that the cost of the New York congresswoman\u2019s haircut was \u201cnews\u201d:\n\n1) this would obvs never be a story about a man\n\n\n\n2) this is not an expensive haircut/color for a public figure who is frequently on TV\n\n\n\n3) if her hair was raggedy, that would be the lead story instead\n\n\n\n4) \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44https://t.co/CyXaQ860ts \u2014 Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) October 10, 2019\n\nso...a normal haircut, then?\n\n\n\nsocialism doesn't mean \"let's all squat in the dirt eating worms\" it means \"no one gets to be a god-king floating atop a billion-dollar raft they can never spend in a thousand lifetimes while people die without medicare or food\" pic.twitter.com/7ckCTWEfzb \u2014 Anthony Oliveira (@meakoopa) October 10, 2019\n\nSo @AOC calls herself a socialist but she gets her haircut at a SALON?!

THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED https://t.co/f4QryDVTSm \u2014 Laura Hudson (@laura_hudson) October 10, 2019\n\nThe Washington Times piece also notes that the 29-year-old \u201ccould have saved roughly $100 for the same hairstyle at the government-subsidized Capitol Hill barbershop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services,\u201d reads the piece, which explains that the barbershop serves \u201cmembers of Congress and the public\u201d and charges $20 for a men\u2019s cut.\n\nAnyone who has ever been to a hair salon can tell you that a men\u2019s haircut almost always costs less than a woman\u2019s, which the article does acknowledge, even though it undercuts the main point of the piece.\n\nThe absurdity of that comparison was also not lost on Twitter:\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t AOC get her hair cut like Jeff Sessions?\u201d is certainly a take pic.twitter.com/sybZxjm26P \u2014 Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) October 10, 2019\n\nA real line in this: \"Her high-dollar hairdo stands in stark contrast to that of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator from Alabama who is a regular customer at Senate Hair Care Services in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building.\" https://t.co/6IxpnHHubS \u2014 Eliza Relman (@eliza_relman) October 10, 2019\n\nHow dare AOC, a young woman with a full head of hair, spend more money on a haircut than Jeff Sessions, a balding old man who still laments the end of slavery? pic.twitter.com/lvx21vXSCS \u2014 The Volatile Mermaid (@OhNoSheTwitnt) October 10, 2019", "description": "The Washington Times was shredded on Twitter for writing about the Democratic lawmaker's hair and proving it does not know how much women's haircuts cost.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f39a8210000c008acc415.jpeg?cache=tgiy1ciihj&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
