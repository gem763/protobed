She said she prefers cannabis companies that take an approach similar to consumer packaged goods (CPG) firms in other industries.\n\n\"Our outlook for the U.S. harmonizes with Canadian cannabis in that scale, profitability and optionality are most relevant upside factors,\" Azer wrote. \"We favor a CPG-type business model that emphasizes finished goods, which carry superior margins relative to retail; depth over breadth optimizes that margin realization.\"\n\nThe opportunity for US cannabis companies is immense. Azer predicts the market for US cannabis will hit $80 billion by 2030 if the federal government legalizes the drug.\n\nCowen is one of the few midsize banks that covers US cannabis companies. Cannabis, at least the THC-containing variety, is federally illegal in the US, though 33 states have some form of legal access to the drug on the books.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nBecause cannabis can't be transported across state lines, the industry in the US is fragmented into a series of different state markets each with their own unique rules. MSOs, then, need to develop robust wholesale and retail models, Azer said.\n\n\"In our view, it all starts with a strong wholesale business, which will provide a path for these emerging MSOs to drive their branded products akin to a traditional CPG company,\" Azer writes. \"We believe that the greatest shareholder value will be created through businesses that emulate a traditional CPG finished goods model.\"\n\nWhile many US cannabis companies are gobbing up cultivation licenses in as many legal states as possible, Azer said she favors \"market depth over breadth.\"\n\nRead more: Here's the pitch deck that cannabis-beverage startup K-Zen used to raise $5 million from seasoned Silicon Valley VC firm DCM Ventures\n\nThere are a few states that offer the combination of high population density and relatively limited licenses per capita, like New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Massachusetts, that MSOs should look to dominate.\n\n\"A focus on states that will actually move the needle should provide ample revenue opportunity and allow for future operating leverage by investing to build out an efficient infrastructure, as opposed to running the risk of being spread too thin,\" writes Azer.\n\nLast, Azer said cannabis companies should avoid \"M&A overdependence.\" Cannabis companies that pursue acquisitions to gain licenses in new states will be rewarded by the market, said Azer. But the market is also looking for cannabis companies who are spending responsibly, especially as cannabis companies deal with capital constraints, said Azer.\n\nHere are Azer's top three cannabis picks, and one she recommends avoiding:\n\nGreen Thumb Industries \u2014 Outperform:\n\nPrice Target: $18.50\n\nChicago-based Green Thumb Industries is Azer's \"favorite name\" among US cannabis companies, she wrote.\n\n\"We believe the company's focused operating model that favors geographic depth, and a balanced revenue approach between wholesale and retail, gives GTI the most revenue and margin potential among our MSO coverage,\" writes Azer.\n\nAzer said she likes GTI's focus on balancing wholesale and retail revenues, and its deliberate approach to M&A and entering new markets.\n\n\"GTI has been more successful in closing M&A than its peers, while also having seen early success in attaining licensing in slow to move states,\" writes Azer.\n\nCuraleaf Holdings \u2014 Outperform:\n\nPrice Target: $10.50\n\n\"CURA boasts the highest revenue base in our coverage, leading gross margins and has two attractive M&A opportunities to scale even further,\" writes Azer. She also highlighted Curaleaf's \"diversified\" revenue streams.\n\nIn July, Curaleaf acquired Grassroots in an $875 million cash-and-stock transaction. In May, the company bought Cura Partners in a $949 million all-stock transaction, adding West Coast operations in the process.\n\nCresco Labs \u2014 Outperform:\n\nPrice Target: $14.00\n\n\"We believe that a robust top-line outlook, coupled with reasonable spending and bottom-line profitability make CL an attractive value proposition for investors looking for a healthy balance between market share gains and financial prudence,\" writes Azer.\n\nIn April, Cresco Labs entered into an agreement to buy Origin House in an approximately $825 million all-stock deal. The deal, which was expected to close in June, has been delayed by the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, though it is likely it will be approved.\n\nAcreage Holdings \u2014 Market Perform:\n\nPrice Target: $9.00\n\nThe Canadian marijuana behemoth Canopy Growth entered into an agreement to purchase Acreage Holdings in April for approximately $3.4 billion pending federal legalization in the US.\n\nAzer said Canopy's deal with Acreage will bring \"tangible benefits\" in terms of brand licensing and intellectual property prior to consolidation (the deal will close once federally permissible in the US). But Acreage \"will need to spend its way to growth, which is a concern given its low margin profile and cash balance.\"\n\nMedMen \u2014 Underperform\n\nPrice Target: $1.50\n\nMedMen has established \"leading brand equity\" in the valuable California market, Azer said. \"However, this has come at a significant cost, as rampant spending has resulted in the need for consistent access to capital.\"\n\n\"A nascent brand strategy is not enough of an offset,\" writes Azer. MedMen received a $250 million capital injection from Gotham Green Partners, a cannabis-focused investment firm, in March, with an additional $30 million tacked on in July.\n\nAzer said that constant need for cash \u2014 coupled with an over-reliance on retail versus wholesale \u2014 will hurt the company in the long-term.", "description": "Cowen's Vivien Azer started covering US cannabis compaies, and makes a bullish case for Green Thumb Industries, Curaleaf, and Cresco Labs.", "authors": ["Jeremy Berke"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7bb17a2e22af0fe8557a59-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
