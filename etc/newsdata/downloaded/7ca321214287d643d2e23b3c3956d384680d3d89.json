The council did not give further details about what the \u201cdangers\u201d were.\n\nThe announcement followed a meeting between the council and the government of South Darfur State, part of Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region that has suffered from violence since 2003 when a conflict erupted between mainly non-Arab tribes and the Arab-led national government of ousted President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.\n\nSudan has often complained about arms trafficked through its borders with Libya and Central African Republic. Conflicts in both nations have left their governments with little or no control of security over swathes of their territory.\n\nThe statement did not mention Chad, which has a long border with Sudan\u2019s Darfur region. Chad and Sudan have security pacts in place and joint forces patrol the boundary.", "description": "Sudan's transitional government ordered the immediate closure of the nation's borders with Libya and Central African Republic on Thursday, citing unspecified security and economic \"dangers\".", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
