And while only 26% of CISOs thought their data collection policies were clear to consumers or citizens, 51% of CEOs thought they were.\n\nWhile 69% of CISOs said that cybersecurity was part of their business plans, only 27% of CEOs thought so.\n\n\"How is it that they do actually not speak with other? There is definitely lack of communication between the two,\" Kiryakova said.\n\n\"The definition of 'cybersecurity' [and] 'data breach' probably [are] not the same for the two roles ... For a CISO, the metadata might represent a data breach, where for the CEO the metadata might not,\" she said.\n\nUnder this context, in 2017, the Australian government started work on a \"cyber lexicon\" to help it better engage in discussions of cybersecurity issues.\n\nA two-hour roundtable at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) in Canberra tried to agree on definitions of \"cyber attack\" and how to count them, as well as \"hack\", \"cyber terrorism\" versus \"cyber warfare\" and \"cyberwar\", and so on.\n\nSee also: Why cybersecurity is a big problem for small businesses (TechRepublic)\n\nThat work seems to have sunk without trace, although the Australian Cyber Security Centre published Cyber Security Terminology, a glossary of words and abbreviations, earlier this month.\n\nThe Unisys research also showed a \"clear disconnect\" in awareness of what data is being collected and of privacy issues more generally.\n\nSome 68% of the CEOs said over the last 10 years there had been no change in the volume or type of data collected by their organisation. Only 19% of CISOs agreed.\n\nOnly 11% of CEOs thought they collected customer or citizen financial data, whereas 57% of CISOs thought they did.\n\nCEOs are twice as confident that their organisation adheres to the Australian Privacy Principles (APP). Although the figure is only 14%, only 7% of CISOs thought they were compliant.\n\n\"This is very low compared to what I would expect the CEO percentage to be in Australia,\" Kiryakova said.\n\nMore broadly, one-third of the surveyed CEOs still believe that cybersecurity is an IT issue (14%) or a compliance issue (18%).\n\nUnisys surveyed 88 CEOs and 54 CISOs in September, from a mix of public and private sector organisations. For those organisations without a dedicated CISO, the employee with overall responsibility for cybersecurity was surveyed.\n\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) comprised 90% of these organisations, matching their proportion in the Australian economy, using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) definition of an organisation with 200 employees or fewer.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\n'Cyber social value' could save lives from cyber incompetence: Report\n\n'Behind each death by computer error is a human mistake, usually caused by faults in management of the cyber ecosystem,' writes Professor Greg Austin.\n\nAI to 'fundamentally shift' global balance of power\n\nThe focus of Australia's cyber diplomacy is expanding to include \"grand strategy in technology\", as well as engagement with technology firms and governments.\n\nSchneier slams Australia's encryption laws and CyberCon speaker bans\n\nGovernments breaking encryption is bad, and 'will get worse once breaking encryption means people can die', says one of the world's leading security experts.\n\nGovernment interference in Australia's premier cybersecurity conference is a worry\n\nTwo 'incongruent' speakers were dumped from Australia's CyberCon.
