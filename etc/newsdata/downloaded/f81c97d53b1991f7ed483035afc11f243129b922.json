This so-called Second Reading vote will determine whether Parliament will allow legislation facilitating the UK\u2019s exit from the EU to proceed, and comes just three days after Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to clinch the support he needed from lawmakers to push his Brexit deal forward over the weekend.\n\nAs part of the deliberations, Members of Parliament will also determine whether they will comply with Johnson\u2019s expedited timeline to try and deliver a Brexit deal by the October 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cOpinions seem to be hardening around the idea that the PM will get his deal through Parliament, if not by the 31st October, then over the next month, which will allow for Brexit to be \u2018done\u2019 by year-end,\u201d Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst for IG Group, wrote in an email. \u201cThis might indeed be the path, but all parties are gearing up for a huge battle, with plenty of twists and turns that could see the bill torpedoed and the country doomed to remain in limbo for much longer.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., economic data set for release include the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index and September\u2019s existing home sales, both due at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nFed speakers remain in a pre-meeting quiet period and will not deliver public remarks.

Third-quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.84 on revenue of $1.58 billion, while consensus analysts had anticipated adjusted EPS of $2.21 on sales of $1.72 billion. Hasbro shares fell more than 17% around market open.\n\n\u201cHasbro remains on track to deliver profitable revenue growth in 2019, behind innovation in gaming, toys and around Hasbro\u2019s Brand Blueprint, CEO Brian Goldner said in a statement. \u201cHowever, as we\u2019ve communicated, the threat and enactment of tariffs reduced revenues in the third quarter and increased expenses to deliver product to retail.\u201d\n\nTraders and financial professionals work at the closing bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Core earnings per share of $1.37 topped expectations by 13 cents.\n\nClosely watched organic revenue growth, which strips out factors like currency impacts, rose 7%, exceeding the 4.15% growth rate expected. Results were driven largely by a surge in beauty product organic sales, which grew 10% during the quarter versus 6.17% expected.\n\nUPS (UPS) posted stronger-than-expected adjusted EPS for the quarter while sales came in light, and announced its Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber would be retiring at the end of the year.

The delivery giant also revised its adjusted free cash flow guidance to be above $4 billion for the year, from as little as $3.5 billion previously indicated.", "description": "Stocks edged up Tuesday morning as investors digested a deluge of corporate earnings and continued to monitor trade and Brexit developments.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ttwJ_t8OBdXLkHQS20J32w--~B/aD0zNzQ1O3c9NTYxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/702ecd30-f4c9-11e9-aefe-d9fb56395069", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
