One wag even suggested that her song \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow\u201d become the new national anthem, replacing impractical politics with nationwide dreaming. But Garland\u2019s life was more complicated than political snark, and a bio-pic must provide that complexity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Judy, the new bio-pic about the late movie and music legend, is most promising, it\u2019s because the filmmakers refuse pretentiousness. It\u2019s set in 1968, the last year of Garland\u2019s life, when her film and TV options had vanished, and she was living a rootless, vagabond life, dragging her two youngest children around Los Angeles. Garland grasped a month-long stint at London\u2019s Talk of the Town nightclub (an early, downscale version of today\u2019s lucrative Las Vegas residencies) as a lifeline. She was afraid to resume her fabled live-performance career but needed financial stability to take care of her children. \u201cI\u2019m a mother. I\u2019m only Judy Garland one hour a night.\u201d\n\nWhen the film doesn\u2019t show promise, it\u2019s because director Rupert Goold and screenwriter Tom Edge depart from the simplicity of its source (an apparently self-reflective stage play by Peter Quilter). The filmmakers check off familiar gossip, cross-cutting Sixties Judy (played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) with Thirties Judy. The latter (played by Darci Shaw) shows the teenage wunderkind during the production of The Wizard of Oz as MGM boss Louis B. Mayer combined employment threats with physical intimidation; she suffered insensitive studio underlings who plied the overworked, malnourished teen with drugs. These Wizard of Oz scenes pretend a knowingness that Quentin Tarantino deliberately avoided in the Sharon Tate scenes of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur cynical view of cultural history goes beyond Goold\u2019s Yellow Brick Road irony, which is all the more reason to want a more sophisticated appreciation of Garland\u2019s ongoing crises. While trying for realism, this movie needs the courage of Terence Davies\u2013style minimalism, by which simply imagining Garland\u2019s early misfortunes would make it possible to sympathize without being gruesome, grotesque, or decadent.\n\nThroughout the opening scenes, Garland wears a brocade pantsuit from Valley of the Dolls (her last Hollywood job, in which she was replaced by Susan Hayward) that refers to insider knowledge yet provides a fascinating context of ambition and debacle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudy avoids the camp irony of Garland the drag-queen icon. Her infamous involvement with the young American opportunist Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) is redeemed by the obvious respect and admiration he shows her. Deans \u2014 a smiling, fetching, admiring, and younger love object \u2014 made Garland feel revived. This is different from Jamie Bell\u2019s compassionate-stud performance in the Gloria Graham bio-pic Film Stars Don\u2019t Die in Liverpool, which confronted the androgynous sexual attraction of movie fans.\n\nGoold and Edge balance awareness of Garland\u2019s infamous fall with a view of her humanity. That good \u201cone hour a night\u201d line is followed by an intriguing \u201cThe rest of the time, I\u2019m part of a family.\u201d There\u2019s effort to suggest that Garland belonged to a secular, unconventional \u201cfamily\u201d of compassionate homosexual followers. She accepts a dinner invitation from a male couple damaged by England\u2019s recently revoked sex laws, and together they sing one of Garland\u2019s signature songs, \u201cGet Happy.\u201d She commiserates with touching emphasis: \u201cThey hound people in this world.\u201d\n\nRecent political bio-pics don\u2019t provide that kind of sympathy. Judy\u2019s lapidary construction is a setting for Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s performance, which attempts a precarious tribute. Zellweger leaps over one hurdle after another \u2014 the double memories of a young Judy and a decrepit Judy. She wears a mature, upswept bob and in her first Talk of the Town performance, her nervous energy shifts into shocked-hurt poses of wide-eyed desperation. Here\u2019s the sympathy missing from our current media-driven political demonization. In last year\u2019s Vice, the odious Dick Cheney parody congratulated Millennials for their superiority over the past. Zellweger\u2019s sensitivity ensures that only a cruel viewer could ignore Garland\u2019s struggle against common obstacles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudy roots its humane lesson in a startling scene that turns a fan\u2019s affinity and identification into a resonant metaphor: Looking for a secure home, Judy and her children Joey and Lorna Luft huddle in Joey\u2019s bedroom wardrobe. This closeted moment \u2014 hiding from the world\u2019s pressure \u2014 is a perfect metaphor of the subject\u2019s emotional need. Second-best is Zellweger\u2019s nightclub performance of \u201cBy Myself.\u201d She can\u2019t match Garland\u2019s voice (who could?), but she makes us focus on Garland\u2019s over-the-rainbow quest for some ideal out there. The force and feeling of Garland\u2019s singing were her power and triumph. Zellweger and her colleagues make us respect that honesty.", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s sensitivity ensures that only a cruel viewer could ignore Garland\u2019s struggle against common obstacles.", "authors": ["Armond White", "Andrew C.
