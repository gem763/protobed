His son Jerome has now taken his place at the competition's helm.\n\nJerome said: \"I think even my father, 32 years ago could never have imagined the scale that this contest has reached.\n\n\"When we see these supporters crossing the world to attend the Bocuse d'Or, then we realize the size of the competition.\"\n\nPreparing a platter and a dish\n\nThe chefs had 5.35 hours to prepare a platter and a dish. This year's recipe was a rack of veal with five prime chops, roasted with offal, which was a specialty of Paul Bocuse.\n\nVegetable Chartreuse with shellfish was the theme of the dish.\n\nAmong the renowned jury of judges was chef R\u00e9gis Marcon, who said: \"We have put in place a regulation that gives more opportunities to emerging countries.\n\n\"The countries of northern Europe very early saw this as a challenge and for them, it was a way to write a blank page of their gastronomy and that is great.\"", "description": "In total, 24 chefs took part in the competition affectionately known as the Olympic Games in the kitchen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/62/89/16/1000x563_cmsv2_4efeaa28-2b08-53d6-b45b-307279346aee-3628916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-30"}
