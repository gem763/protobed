A total of 13 Boeing 737 NG airplanes have now been grounded worldwide. Two of the planes were grounded by Southwest, while 11 more were grounded by Brazil\u2019s Gol Linhas Aereas.\n\n\"Boeing regrets the impact this issue is having on GOL, as well as our 737 NG customers worldwide,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We are actively working with our customers with inspection findings to procure parts, develop repair and replace plans, and provide all the technical support needed to safely return every impacted airplane to service as soon as possible.\"\n\nInspectors told airlines to inspect a total of 165 of the 737 NG planes for structural damage after they found cracks on an airplane part known as the \u201cpickle fork.\u201d That part, USA Today explained, attaches the fuselage to the wing. Nearly all of the 165 jets in question were Southwest aircraft.\n\nFor its part Southwest explained it found no issue with the \u201cvast majority\u201d of planes, though it \u201cremoved the two aircraft from our operation and reported the findings to Boeing and the FAA.\u201d\n\nReuters further explained, the 737 NG aircraft was first delivered to airlines in 1997. The NG was the third iteration of the 737 and precedes the 737 Max. All 737 Max aircraft remain grounded following two fatal crashes. And it appears the 737 Max will stay on the ground for a bit longer than expected.\n\nAmerican Airlines announced it won\u2019t return the aircraft to service until mid-January, however, the FAA replied to that announcement saying it had no set timeline to return the airplane model to service. In the meantime, Southwest pilots are suing Boeing claiming the airplane manufacturer knew its planes weren\u2019t safe before they even hit the market. Boeing called that claim \u201cmeritless.\u201d", "description": "U.S. regulators hit Boeing with more bad news this week after they found cracks in several planes built by the aviation giant.", "authors": ["Stacey Leasca"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fl9ZH.jWGQ2H7OaxgIeIMw--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel.travelleisure.com/2e3362f34441cbb79d0e7f743c55842c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
