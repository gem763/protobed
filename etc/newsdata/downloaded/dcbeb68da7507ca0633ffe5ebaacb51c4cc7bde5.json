Farrow\u2019s book, which details how allegations of sexual abuse against powerful men like Trump and Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein were suppressed and their victims silenced, will be published on Tuesday.\n\nCan finally talk about one of the big pieces of news in Catch and Kill: it\u2019s the first time a reporter has gained access to AMI\u2019s list of the contents of its vault of Trump secrets\u2014and the first disclosure of claims that AMI destroyed material about Trump before the election. https://t.co/OSv662Jb3v \u2014 Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) October 14, 2019\n\nAccording to \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d the Journal called the Enquirer in early November 2016 to request comment for its story about how the tabloid\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., had paid $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her quiet about an affair she\u2019d had with Trump a decade earlier. The Journal\u2019s story was published on Nov. 4, 2016, just four days ahead of the presidential election.\n\nDylan Howard, then the Enquirer\u2019s editor-in-chief, \u201cappeared to be in a panic\u201d after the Journal\u2019s call, Farrow said in his book.\n\nThat same day, Howard directed staffers to \u201cget everything out\u201d of a small safe that allegedly contained a bunch of Trump-linked \u201cdirt.\u201d Farrow claims \u201ca Trump-related document from the safe, along with others in the Enquirer\u2019s possession\u201d were then shredded.\n\nAMI told Politico in a statement that Farrow\u2019s allegations about the destroyed documents were \u201ccompletely untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Farrow\u2019s narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\n\n5. This is how chapter three of @RonanFarrow\u2019s book begins...\n\n\n\nWith Dylan Howard, the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, ordering the contents of a safe to be shredded after getting a call from the Wall Street Journal about Trump. https://t.co/eLcNiasfdB pic.twitter.com/ehUCrmtxkE \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\nSince the Journal\u2019s reporting in November 2016 about AMI\u2019s deal with McDougal, other reports have surfaced about how the company \u2015 under the tutelage of its chairman and longtime Trump ally, David Pecker \u2015 worked closely with Trump and his associates, including his former fixer Michael Cohen, to help quash embarrassing or otherwise negative stories about Trump. Those stories included McDougal\u2019s and also porn star Stormy Daniels\u2019 allegations of an earlier affair.\n\nA former Enquirer journalist, Jerry George, reportedly told Farrow that Pecker \u201ckilled perhaps 10 fully reported stories about Trump, and nixed many more potential leads during George\u2019s 28 years at the Enquirer.\u201d\n\nAMI had previously denied employing a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d tactic on behalf of Trump \u2015 which involves buying the rights of a story but never publishing it. The company told the Journal in 2016 that it had \u201cnot paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, however, AMI admitted to making the hush money payment to McDougal in coordination with Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nCohen also confessed to paying $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels to prevent her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen, who was reportedly tipped off by Pecker and Howard about Daniels\u2019 allegations, is currently serving a three-year jail sentence for campaign finance violations related to his role in the hush money payments to McDougal and Daniels.", "description": "The journalist claims in his new book that the Enquirer's top editor ordered staffers to destroy sensitive Trump-linked documents before the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da57e1b200000b00c500cc7.jpeg?cache=2dzq8zonls&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
