The team could shut down the veteran signal-caller if the Broncos don\u2019t receive a positive medical update after Denver\u2019s Nov. 10 bye.\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s not going to play this week. He\u2019s got a disk or neck injury,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cHe\u2019ll definitely miss this week and then we\u2019ll reevaluate after the bye and see where it\u2019s at.\u201d\n\nBrandon Allen, claimed off waivers Sept. 1 from the Los Angeles Rams, will start in place of Flacco against the Browns. Fangio said the team will decide later in the week if Brett Rypien will be elevated from the practice squad to the roster, or if rookie Drew Lock will be activated from injured reserve to be the backup quarterback.\n\nDuring the second half of Sunday\u2019s loss to the Indianapolis Colts, Flacco was seen getting his neck evaluated by the Broncos\u2019 medical staff on the sideline. The Colts sacked him three times in the matchup, including on the game\u2019s final play.\n\nFlacco has been brought down 26 times in eight starts this season. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 Jameis Winston are the only two quarterbacks that have been sacked more this year.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 The Denver Broncos will be without starting quarterback Joe Flacco for Sunday\u2019s game against the Cleveland Browns.
