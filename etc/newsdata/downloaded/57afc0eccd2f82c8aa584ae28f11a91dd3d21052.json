The Fed's next policy meeting will be held at the end of the month.\n\nOther crucial factors influencing investor sentiment this month include high-level trade negotiations between the United States and China next week and third-quarter corporate earnings reports.\n\nThe ADP National Employment Report, due at 8:15 a.m. ET (1215 GMT) is expected to show U.S. private payrolls grew by 140,000 jobs in September, fewer than the 195,000 added in August.\n\nThe report is seen as a precursor to the Labor Department's more comprehensive jobs report, due on Friday.\n\nAt 7:18 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis <1YMcv1> were down 159 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 e-minis <EScv1> were down 16.75 points, or 0.57% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis <NQcv1> were down 52.25 points, or 0.68%.\n\nActivision Blizzard Inc <ATVI.O> dropped 2.6% in premarket trading after Bernstein downgraded the videogame maker's shares to \"market perform\".\n\nMonster Beverage Corp <MNST.O> fell 2.4% after the energy drink maker's stock was downgraded by Guggenheim to \"neutral.\"\n\nStitch Fix Inc <SFIX.O> dropped 8.1% after the company forecast current-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates.\n\nShares in homebuilder Lennar Corp <LEN.N> gained 2.3% after the company reported better-than-expected profit as cheaper mortgage rates led to higher demand for its homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "On the first day of the fourth quarter, the S&P 500  and Dow  indexes recorded their sharpest slide in more than a month, wiping off their third-quarter gains.  \"What is hard to argue with is that the global manufacturing sector is now very much in a recession,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim", "authors": ["Medha Singh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6rWNnGFgRPKv3qgr0zde8Q--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/87eb36b4d0361f8147936dda248a3634"}
