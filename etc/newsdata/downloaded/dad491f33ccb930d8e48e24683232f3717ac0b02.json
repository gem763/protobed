Ramsey has made it clear he wanted to be traded, but Jaguars owner Shad Khan did not want to lose him. Apparently they decided that the Rams\u2019 offer was too good to pass up.\n\nIt\u2019s an aggressive move from the Rams, who have fallen behind both the 49ers and Seahawks in the NFC West and are eager to turn their season around. The Rams\u2019 pass defense was already struggling, even before putting cornerback Aqib Talib on injured reserve and trading cornerback Marcus Peters to the Ravens.\n\nRamsey is one of the most talented cornerbacks in the NFL and has the potential to be a major difference-maker. For the Rams, he\u2019d better be. They\u2019ve just given up a fortune to acquire him.", "description": "The Jalen Ramsey era in Jacksonville is over, and now he's heading to Los Angeles.
