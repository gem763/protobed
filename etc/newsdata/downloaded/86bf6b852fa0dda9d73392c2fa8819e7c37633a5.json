We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 jack \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf0e (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nTwitter\u2019s announcement covers ads intended to influence elections including ballot measures, as well as those that address \u201cissues of national importance.\u201d The new rules will be applied globally, published by mid-November and take effect later in the month, Dorsey said.\n\nBut the change drew a mixed reception, with some critics highlighting that it would not affect what users can tweet and share on their own. Teddy Goff, who served as President Obama\u2019s digital director in 2012 and as senior adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, said any update by Twitter that does not address the \u201corganic and algorithmic spread of hate speech and discrimination and dishonesty\u201d is insufficient.\n\nThe political ad ban also might not have much impact on widely followed accounts, including President Trump\u2019s, whose tweets already reach more than 66 million users each day. Some critics, including Democrats, have urged Twitter to block or remove the commander in chief\u2019s tweets, arguing his comments are incendiary or incorrect. Twitter has declined to take action, beyond stressing some narrow cases in which it would limit the reach of tweets from a head of state.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, the decision illustrates a sharp symbolic rift between Dorsey\u2019 and one of his peers, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who on Wednesday stood by his company\u2019s controversial policy that essentially allows politicians to lie in ads during the tech giant\u2019s third-quarter earnings call.\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,\u201d he said.\n\nThe controversy first arose earlier this month, when former vice president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the White House, asked Facebook to remove a Trump campaign ad that contained multiple falsehoods. Facebook declined, prompting backlash from other 2020 contenders.\n\nAD\n\nIn response, Zuckerberg has defended the policy in recent weeks, stressing the tech giant should not stand in the way of political leaders\u2019 speech. During the earnings call, he estimated that political advertising next year would make up about 0.5 percent of Facebook\u2019s revenue. Based on the company\u2019s revenue for 2018, that would amount to $279 million. Facebook\u2019s revenue next year is expected to be billions of dollars higher.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate to suggest that the only option available to social media companies \u2026 is the full withdrawal of political advertising,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Bill Russo said about Twitter in a statement, \u201cbut when faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Twitter executives labored to explain their decision as a matter of principle, acknowledging that political ad spending amounted to less than $3 million during the 2018 midterm elections. Jasmine Enberg, a senior analyst at eMarketer, said it is \u201clikely that political advertising doesn\u2019t make up a critical part of Twitter\u2019s core business.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor example, President Trump has run not a single ad on Twitter over the past seven days, while he\u2019s spent nearly a quarter of a million dollars on Facebook over the same period, according to the companies\u2019 archives. Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, still blasted Twitter for the ban. \u201cThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nPolitical advertising long has proven a thorny issue for Silicon Valley, a potential profit windfall that has come at steep costs in recent years. During the 2016 election, agents tied to the Russian government purchased promoted tweets and other forms of online ads as part of their campaign to stoke political discord, promote then-candidate Trump and undermine Democratic contender Clinton, according to congressional investigators.\n\nRegulators responded by lambasting social media sites for failing to spot such efforts by a foreign power to interfere in U.S. elections, and the pressure resulted in major changes \u2014 including efforts by Twitter and others to more clearly label political ads, verify the individuals purchasing them and cache them for the public to view. Still, lawmakers threatened to pass new laws, arguing that online ads were subject to far fewer, less restrictive rules than broadcast television.\n\nAD\n\nIn his tweets, Dorsey on Wednesday endorsed those calls for new federal rules.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAd transparency requirements are progress, but not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.\u201d\n\nDaniel Kreiss, a professor of media and journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, expressed some early concern that Twitter\u2019s decision to ban political ads could spell particular trouble for down-ballot candidates with smaller followings online. Twitter ads, he said, are \u201cone of the ways that candidates get their message in front of a public whose attention is extremely divided and fragmented.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile Facebook has received much of the criticism for political advertising policies, Twitter also has experienced its share of controversy.\n\nIn August, President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, along with major Republican committees, pulled advertising dollars from Twitter after the platform locked the campaign account for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Twitter said a video of protesters making threats against the Kentucky Republican violated its rules against threatening or promoting violence.\n\nMarie C.
