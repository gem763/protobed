Zaid says both officials have full protection of the law intended to protect whistleblowers from being fired in retaliation. While this second official has spoken with the IG \u2014 the internal watchdog office created to handle complaints \u2014 this person has not communicated yet with the congressional committees conducting the investigation. The New York Times on Friday cited anonymous sources in reporting that a second intelligence official was weighing whether to file his own formal complaint and testify to Congress. Zaid says he does not know if the second whistleblower he represents is the person identified in the Times report.\n\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Zaid confirmed his firm is representing another so-called whistleblower. This one \u201chas firsthand knowledge,\u201d he tweeted without elaborating.\n\nNEWS UPDATE: I can confirm this report of a second #whistleblower being represented by our legal team. They also made a protected disclosure under the law and cannot be retaliated against. This WBer has first hand knowledge. https://t.co/zYkUYgJ0mE \u2014 Mark S. Zaid (@MarkSZaidEsq) October 6, 2019\n\nIn his twitter profile, Zaid describes himself as a \u201cnon-partisan\u201d attorney \u201chandling cases involving national security, security clearances, govt investigations, media, Freedom of Information Act, & whistleblowing.\u201d\n\nMissing from his twitter profile and from much of the the news media coverage about Zaid\u2019s role representing the so-called whistleblowers in the impeachment scandal is that he co-founded Whistleblower Aid. That detail is also not mentioned in Zaid\u2019s bio on his attorney website.\n\nThis even though Whistleblower Aid has been actively helping the first whistleblower also being represented by Zaid by setting up a GoFundMe page seeking to raise funds for the purported whistleblower\u2019s defense. The page already brought in some $210,066 with a goal of raising $300,000.\n\nWhistleblower Aid was founded in September 2017 in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency to encourage government whistleblowers to come forward.\n\nThe group did not sit around waiting for whistleblowers. Upon its founding, Whistleblower Aid actively sought to attract the attention of Trump administration government employees by reportedly blasting advertisements for its whistleblower services on Metro trains, using mobile billboards that circled government offices for 10 hours a day, and handing out whistles on street corners as a gimmick to gain attention.\n\nWhen Whistleblower Aid was first formed, the main banner for the mission statement of its website contained clearly anti-Trump language.\n\n\u201cToday our Republic is under threat. Whistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world,\u201d read the previous statement which can still be viewed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.\n\nThat part of the mission statement received attention in the conservative media.\n\nThe sentence \u201ctoday our Republic is under threat,\u201d has since been scrubbed from the website. The mission statement now only reads, \u201cWhistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Washington Post just after Whistleblower Aid\u2019s founding, John Tye, who co-founded the organization with Zaid, claimed, \u201cThis is not a partisan effort,\u201d and then went on to express seemingly partisan alarm about Trump.\n\nTye continued, \u201cAt the same time, yes, the rule of law starts with the office of the president. Like many other people, we are definitely concerned about things that are happening in the administration. The decision to fire [FBI Director] James Comey. The lack of transparency. A lot of people have questions about whether this administration respects the rule of law.\u201d\n\nFar-left ties, Democrat links\n\nZaid doubles as Executive Director and founder of the James Madison Project, which says it seeks to promote government accountability. The Project features on its four-person advisory board John Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and founded the Soros-funded Center for American Progress pushing a progressive agenda.\n\nWhistleblower Aid co-founder Tye himself is a whistleblower. He is a former State Department official who went public in 2014 about U.S. government electronic surveillance practices.\n\nTye\u2019s bio on Whistleblower Aid\u2019s website brandishes his work for far-left groups.\n\nThe bio reads:\n\nMr. Tye has worked at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Avaaz, and also Southeast Louisiana Legal Services as a Skadden Fellow. He was on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its anti-conservative stance and controversially publishes a \u201chate map\u201d listing groups that warn about radical Islam such as Jihad Watch, the Clarion Project, the Center for Security Policy. On that same \u201chate map\u201d are racist extremist organizations like Global Crusaders: Order of the Ku Klux Klan and United Klans of America.\n\nTye\u2019s other former employer, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is financed heavily by billionaire activist and Democratic Party mega-donor George Soros and is known for its hyper-partisan liberal activism.\n\nAvaaz, a radical group where Tye served as campaign and legal director, describes itself as a \u201cglobal web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere.\u201d The group has repeatedly engaged in anti-Israel activism.\n\nChanneling the mantra of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, Avaaz says it aims to \u201corganize citizens of all nations to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want.\u201d\n\nAvaaz was founded in 1997 by the Soros-funded, partisan MoveOn.org organization and by the Soros-funded Res Publica activist group.\n\nTax forms from Soros\u2019s Open Society document donations to Res Publica specifically earmarked for support to Avaaz. Res Publica oversees Avaaz activism.\n\nThe same year that Whistleblower Aid was founded, Avaaz\u2019s former general counsel and campaign director, Ian Bassin, in 2017 formed United to Protect Democracy. The latter is a grouping of former top lawyers for the Obama administration working to utilize legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nBassin\u2019s United to Protect Democracy works in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants.\n\nCommon funding themes\n\nWhistleblower Aid\u2019s ties to Soros funding and far-left groups furthers a theme of such organizations being closely linked to numerous aspects of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nSome of those common threads run through an organization repeatedly relied upon in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint and are tied to CrowdStrike, the outside firm utilized to conclude that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers since the DNC would not allow the U.S. government to inspect the servers.\n\nCrowdStrike founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council.\n\nThe Atlantic Council is funded by and works in partnership with Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nBreitbart News reported that a staffer for Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence took a trip to Ukraine last month sponsored and organized by the Atlantic Council think tank. Schiff\u2019s office denied any impropriety.\n\nThe Schiff staff member, Thomas Eager, is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship. Burisma in January 2017 signed a \u201ccooperative agreement\u201d with the Council to sponsor the organization\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nBesides Burisma funding, the Council is also financed by Google as well as Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. and the U.S. State Department.\n\nGoogle Capital also led a $100 million funding drive that financed Crowdstrike directly.\n\nGoogle, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe charges in the July 22 report referenced in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented.\n\nOne key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d\n\nThis was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.\n\nEven though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThat footnote reads:\n\nIn a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.\n\nThe so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:\n\nWrite that Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko \u201calso stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.\u201d\n\nDocument that Trump adviser Rudi Giuliani \u201chad spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nBolster the charge that, \u201cI also learned from a U.S. official that \u2018associates\u2019 of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\u201d The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, \u201cI do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.\u201d\n\nThe OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.\n\nThe OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nThe so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.\n\nAnother listed OCCRP funder is the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.\n\nTogether with Soros\u2019s Open Society, Omidyar also funds the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which hosts the International Fact-Checking Network that partnered with Facebook to help determine whether news stories are \u201cdisputed.\u201d\n\nLike OCCRP, the Poynter Institute\u2019s so-called news fact-checking project is openly funded by not only Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations but also Google and the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\nCrowdStrike and DNC servers\n\nCrowdStrike, meanwhile, was brought up by Trump in his phone call with Zelensky.\n\nAccording to the transcript, Trump told Zelensky, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nIn his extensive report, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller notes that his investigative team did not \u201cobtain or examine\u201d the servers of the DNC in determining whether those servers were hacked by Russia.\n\nThe DNC famously refused to allow the FBI to access its servers to verify the allegation that Russia carried out a hack during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the DNC reached an arrangement with the FBI in which CrowdStrike conducted forensics on the server and shared details with the FBI.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the FBI registered \u201cmultiple requests at different levels,\u201d to review the DNC\u2019s hacked servers. Ultimately, the DNC and FBI came to an agreement in which a \u201chighly respected private company\u201d\u2014a reference to CrowdStrike\u2014would carry out forensics on the servers and share any information that it discovered with the FBI, Comey testified.\n\nA senior law enforcement official stressed the importance of the FBI gaining direct access to the servers, a request that was denied by the DNC.\n\n\u201cThe FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated,\u201d the official was quoted by the news media as saying.\n\n\u201cThis left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier,\u201d the official continued.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
