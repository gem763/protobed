The legislation now proceeds to royal assent \u2014 a formality that will result in its becoming law.\n\nThe legislation would force Johnson to formally ask the European Union to extend the Brexit deadline through next January, if a new withdrawal deal is not agreed upon by Oct. 19.\n\nThe current Brexit deadline is Oct. 31.\n\nWhen Johnson took the U.K.'s top job less than three months ago, he promised to adhere to the exit date \u2014 even if no detailed blueprint to carry out Britain's complex divorce from the European Union has been agreed upon.\n\nJohnson says the only way forward is for Britain to hold snap elections on Oct. 15. So far, neither chamber of Parliament has agreed to that election date; another vote is planned for Monday, after the Brexit legislation becomes law.\n\nJohnson needs two-thirds support of Parliament to hold elections. But earlier this week, the lower chamber rejected his request by a vote of 298-56. And opposition parties promise to block the request again on Monday.\n\nArguments over snap elections and a no-deal Brexit are the latest chapter in the Brexit saga that has unfolded since 2016, when voters approved a referendum for the country to leave the EU. And with Parliament back in session, it has been a tumultuous week for Johnson.\n\nOn Thursday, the prime minister's brother, Jo Johnson resigned as a member of Parliament. He tweeted that he was \"torn between family loyalty and the national interest.\" Jo Johnson called it \"an unresolvable tension\" and said others should take on roles in Parliament. He ended his tweet with \"#overandout.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Commons voted on its bid to quash a no-deal Brexit \u2014 a defeat for Johnson that came a day after another a pair of political setbacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, a defection from Johnson's Conservative Party stripped him of his single-seat governing majority \u2014 in a dramatic scene that played out as Johnson addressed the chamber. On the same day, 21 members of Johnson's party joined with the opposition to strip from him control of the chamber's agenda.\n\nFinally, on Friday, Johnson was given at least one bit of positive news: London's High Court rejected a legal challenge that seeks to block the prime minister from suspending Parliament for weeks. Johnson's prorogation plan gained the consent of Queen Elizabeth II last week.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alastair Grant/AP Alastair Grant/AP\n\nThe High Court says prominent businesswoman Gina Miller, who brought the case could appeal. The BBC reports:\n\n\"Rejecting Ms Miller's case, Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said she could immediately appeal because of the important points of law at stake.\n\n\"The appeal is expected to be heard at the Supreme Court on 17 September.\"", "description": "The House of Lords gives final approval to a bill blocking Britain from leaving the European Union without first securing an exit agreement.", "authors": ["Brakkton Booker"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/06/48688285733_1d2633fa9f_k_wide-47f0ac16adc8dbc6135bf2c378984fc731affe49.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
