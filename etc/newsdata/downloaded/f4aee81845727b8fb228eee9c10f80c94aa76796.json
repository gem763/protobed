Prosecutors are now expected to move the focus to Cho and summon him for questioning sooner or later.\n\nChung reportedly denied all the charges against her.\n\nOne of her lawyers claimed, \"Chung suffers from a brain tumor\" in an apparent bid to avoid her detention.\n\nBut the court dismissed the claim, judging her health condition as not being serious enough to justify sparing her detention.", "description": "Ex-Minister Cho Kuk's Wife Arrested on a Dozen Charges", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/24/2019102401273_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
