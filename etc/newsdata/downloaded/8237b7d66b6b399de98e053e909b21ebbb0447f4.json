I\u2019m incredibly proud of our Unite team that worked so hard to make this happen\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nOne Nissan insider told the Mirror: \u201cThis move is going to affect a lot of people, and hit a lot of pockets.\n\n\u201cNissan is planning to get rid of the eight-hour shift, which at least 2,500 and as many as 3,000 currently work in Sunderland.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing this basically to respond to a decline in sales of Nissan cars, as well as diesel engines more generally across Europe.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have two production lines. One of them is made up of guys who work two shifts - the day shift and the late shift.\n\n\u201cThe other is made up of 3,000 or so who work three shifts - day shift, late shift, and the night shift they\u2019re about to abolish.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\n\u201cIf they decide to roll out this policy and cut the hours that thousands could work by eight-hours, they won\u2019t be entitled to the night shift allowance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s set at 22% - and this will fall to 12%. So they\u2019ll be hit in the pocket by 10%.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the company directors win, because they know they can produce the same number of cars on day and late shifts without running the night shift.\n\n\u201cBut people won\u2019t have a choice about this. Their families will lose out because of it. And it will affect thousands more in the area who work with Nissan.\u201d\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nNissan had previously received assurances from then Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government it would be protected from the impact of Brexit.\n\nHowever, the Japanese manufacturer recently warned that a No Deal Brexit would have \u201cserious implications for British industry\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for Nissan said: \"To support the production of new Juke, extra manufacturing staff will be needed on the plant\u2019s production Line Two.\n\n\u201cIn a restructuring of the production schedule, these staff will transfer from production Line One, with both lines operating on a two shift pattern. Overall headcount at the plant will remain the same.\u201d\n\nNissan said last week that plans to build the Qashqai in Sunderland had not changed following speculation it could change its mind if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.\n\nThe company said that, along with other firms with major investments in the UK, it was waiting for clarity on what the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU will look like.\n\nThe car industry has been warning for years about the impact on the sector of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Sunderland plant makes the Qashqai, Juke and electric Leaf models.\n\nCar sales in September, the industry's second most important month, increased by 1.3% from a year earlier, well below the double-digit growth hoped for.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn the first nine months of the year, car sales fell 2.5% to 1.86 million, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) reported earlier this week.\n\nSMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said September's rise was \"fairly paltry.\"\n\nHe added that consumer confidence was being undermined by political and economic uncertainty.\n\nNissan confirmed in June that it will axe thousands of roles at factories around the world in the next three years.\n\nThe automotive giant - which employs 7,000 workers in Sunderland - announced a wage of \"strategic reforms\" as part of efforts to revive profits amid financial troubles.\n\nThe company said it will reduce its global capacity - along with the products it produces - by 10% by December 2022.\n\nThis will come hand-in-hand with 12,500 job cuts.", "description": "Unite the union has confirmed Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is bringing an end to night working at its plant in Sunderland", "authors": ["Mark Ellis", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Pa", "Getty", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20547624.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Nissan-SunderlandMAIN.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
