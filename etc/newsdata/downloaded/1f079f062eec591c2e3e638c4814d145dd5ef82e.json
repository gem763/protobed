That is not the case,\" he said, adding that his impatience was with France's system itself.\n\n\"Now, I think I need to take more time to explain where we are and what we want to do exactly.\"\n\nAnalysts say that for now, Macron appears to have seen off the worst of the yellow vest protests, which are still taking place every weekend but on nothing like the scale of six months ago.\n\nBut he has to keep an eye on his own popularity and France's powerful unions as he seeks to implement reforms at home. The Paris metro last Friday saw its worst strike in years over a planned pension overhaul.\n\nHe has also taken an active role on the international stage, though his drives to defuse the Iran nuclear dispute and also bring peace to Ukraine could yet be derailed.\n\nTime quoted Macron as saying he was currently in a \"Death Valley\" period between setting out his reforms and seeing them bearing fruit.\n\n\"The end of Death Valley is the day you have results,\" he said. \"Building this new France is my obsession.\"", "description": "President Emmanuel Macron has said he believes the yellow vest protests that rocked France since last year have been good for him as they made him listen and communicate better, in an interview published on Thursday.
