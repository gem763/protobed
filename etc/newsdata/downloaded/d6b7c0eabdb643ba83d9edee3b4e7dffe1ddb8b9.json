There, they found more illegal images on his phone.\n\n\u201cWe are sickened and disturbed by the charges brought against Mike Folmer yesterday,\u201d Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe have reviewed the criminal complaint and spoke with Mike Folmer early this morning to insist on his resignation from the Senate.\u201d\n\nAccording to PennLive.com, Folmer admitted to creating the Tumblr account, and told investigators that he was dealing with \u201csome personal problems.\u201d\n\nHe has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf said in a statement that Folmer\u2019s resignation was the \u201cright decision.\u201d He added, \u201cWe elect leaders to serve as a voice for those who do not have the ability to advocate for their own needs, demanding that they will protect our children, families, and communities. The charges against Senator Folmer are disgusting and beyond comprehension, and show he has taken advantage of the trust and privilege afforded by the people of Pennsylvania.\u201d", "description": "Pennsylvania State senator Michael Folmer resigned on Wednesday, the day after police charged him with uploading child pornography to his phone.", "authors": ["Madeleine Aggeler"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/18-ap-michael-folmer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
