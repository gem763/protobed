All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\"\n\nThe company's decision comes against the backdrop of growing concern about the influence social media plays in elections, particularly following the 2016 US presidential elections, when Russia is believed to have used sites including Twitter and Facebook to try to influence the result in favour of Donald Trump.\n\nFacebook has been criticised for saying this month that it will not fact-check ads by politicians or their campaigns, which could allow them to lie freely. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook.\n\nLast month sites including Twitter, Facebook and Google refused to remove a misleading video advert from Mr Trump's campaign that targeted former vice-president Joe Biden, one of the frontrunners in the race to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn response, Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic presidential hopeful, made a point by deliberately running a false advert on Facebook that claimed Mr Zuckerberg was endorsing President Trump for re-election.\n\nCritics have called on Facebook to ban all political adverts.\n\nCNN chief Jeff Zucker said the policy of allowing lies was ludicrous and advised Facebook to sit out the 2020 election until it can produce a more effective model.", "description": "Twitter is banning all political advertising worldwide, saying: \"We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought.\" In a thread, CEO Jack Dorsey\u00a0insisted the move was not about \"free expression\" but about protecting the public.
