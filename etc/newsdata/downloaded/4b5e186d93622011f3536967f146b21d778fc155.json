Three had criminal records, Trujillo said.\n\nForensics experts have been working the site with the help of trained dogs and heavy machinery since it was discovered on September 3. The well measures more than five meters deep.\n\nAnother mass grave was discovered nearby in May, with 30 bodies inside.\n\nMore than 3 000 unmarked graves with nearly 5 000 bodies have been found in Mexico since the government deployed the military to fight the country's powerful drug cartels in 2006.\n\nSince the controversial military operation was launched, more than 250,000 people have been murdered in the country, a wave of violence many experts blame on fragmented cartels waging war on the army and each other.\n\nAnother 40 000 people are missing in Mexico.\n\nJalisco, home to the violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has been among the states hit hardest.\n\nThe government deployed 1,400 army reinforcements to Jalisco in March, and four months later another 1,800 members of the National Guard, a newly created force at the heart of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's strategy to contain the violence.", "description": "Mexican forensics experts have found at least 29 bodies stuffed in 119 plastic bags that were dumped in the bottom of a well outside the western city of Guadalajara, officials say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/746/f4e18a2c94e34b419edd64a11cc18dc5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
