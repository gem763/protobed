European commission negotiators said such a proposal would leave Ireland in a constant state of uncertainty over the future.\n\nBrexit: Bill intended to block no deal to become law after being passed by House of Lords \u2013 live news Read more\n\nThe development comes as EU sources close to the negotiation spoke of their doubts about the potential fruitfulness of the talks given the likelihood of a general election and the insistence from the prime minister that his negotiating position has been wrecked by no deal being taken off the table.\n\nEU officials involved in the negotiations are understood to have lamented that Frost has been acting \u201clike a spokesman\u201d for the prime minister, saying that Theresa May\u2019s envoy, Olly Robbins, had at least been able to talk around the problems encountered in the talks.\n\nEU sources said the commission would continue to meet with the British delegation for as long as Downing Street wished.\n\nJohnson is insisting in his attempted renegotiation that the Irish backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, must be ditched from the withdrawal agreement.\n\nJohnson has floated the idea of Northern Ireland staying aligned with EU standards on agrifoods, which make up a large proportion of the trade crossing the border with the Republic. Such a move would remove the need for sanitary and phytosanitary checks (SPS) on animals and animal products crossing the border on the island of Ireland, although all other goods would not be covered and it would not deal with the issues of VAT and customs checks.\n\nEarlier in the week Johnson had referenced the comments of the former Democratic Unionist party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley who had said of Northern Ireland that the people were British but \u201cthe cattle were Irish\u201d.\n\nJohnson is insisting, in a move designed to make the proposal palatable to the DUP, that the arrangement would have to \u201cclearly enjoy the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest\u201d.\n\nIt is understood the UK has suggested there is a need for Stormont to be able to vote on the continuation of the proposed common regulatory area, which has been described by EU officials as a \u201cbackstop-lite\u201d.\n\nEU sources said the suggestion was firmly rebuffed and that recent meetings had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d, with the gap between the two negotiating teams seemingly widening by the day.\n\nSources said the discussion over the common agrifood area was \u201ccursory\u201d and further discussions over the UK\u2019s preferred alternative to the backstop were expected next week.\n\nIrish government sources reacted angrily to Johnson\u2019s gambit, saying the protection of the all-Ireland economy was a vital element of the Good Friday agreement, and that the responsibility for protecting the peace process lay with Westminster and not the Northern Ireland assembly.\n\nThe UK government also sought to find a role for the Northern Ireland assembly in the future negotiations over the shared agrifood zone but an EU diplomat said there was a high degree of scepticism.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe EU negotiates with the UK authorities at the departing stage and not its constituent elements.\n\n\u201cHaving Stormont overturn an agreed and ratified agreement at a later stage prior to the backstop entering into force will undermine the withdrawal. A curious ask given the fact that currently Stormont hasn\u2019t sat for over two years?\u201d\n\nA UK government spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s sherpa David Frost and a cross-government team met officials from the commission\u2019s A50 taskforce today.\n\n\u201cThe UK team presented some preliminary ideas on how any all-island SPS solutions could involve the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest \u2013 something the prime minister referred to earlier this week in parliament. The discussions highlighted a number of issues which would need to be considered further and it was agreed that this would be discussed again next week.\u201d", "description": "British proposal to involve Stormont assembly in backstop alternative knocked back by EU", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf875f1f569958d6df8acbf36164ed289d04bc44/555_257_2813_1689/master/2813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f621074008710e4d2e10c89f7d742892", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
