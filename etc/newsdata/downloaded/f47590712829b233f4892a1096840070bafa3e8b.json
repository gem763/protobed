The Korean group were the first non-Arab artists to play a stadium in the country, with a concert at Riyadh\u2019s King Fahd International Stadium held on Friday night as part of their Love Yourself: Speak Yourself tour.\n\nThe seven-piece is one of the world\u2019s biggest acts, regularly topping charts globally and selling out stadiums in Asia, the US and the UK. In Riyadh they played to an audience of about 30,000 in a venue with a capacity of almost 70,000.\n\nLove Yourself more: K-pop band BTS take 'extended break' to 'enjoy life' Read more\n\nThe group were greeted by about 100 fans at the airport as they arrived in the country. Many more flew in from Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to attend the concert.\n\nWomen have only been allowed to enter King Fahd Stadium since 2017.\n\nTURKI ALALSHIKH (@Turki_alalshikh) \u0628\u064a \u062a\u064a \u0627\u0633 ... \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0639\u0628 \u0645\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0645\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0667 pic.twitter.com/lsfcONHgSI\n\nCriticism of the decision to play Saudi Arabia erupted almost the moment the concert was announced in July, dividing BTS\u2019s fans, with many citing the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey and the kingdom\u2019s human rights record.\n\nIt also seems at odds with the group\u2019s involvement in Unicef\u2019s End Violence campaign and their own \u201cSpeak Yourself\u201d speech to the UN, given Saudi Arabia\u2019s history of censorship, its restriction of women\u2019s rights and that same-sex sexual activity is illegal.\n\nOn This Day In K-Pop (@onthisdaykpop) Remember there are Muslim K-Pop fans who are also LGBTQ+, some of them have been vocal about their contempt for the concert, but for those who live in Saudi Arabia speaking out on the concert means getting killed.\n\nWhile many fans supported the group\u2019s decision to perform, in the lead-up to the concert, others posted tweets with the hashtag #BTSdontgo. On Saturday, the Human Rights Foundation joined the criticism, saying the group was whitewashing the regime\u2019s human rights violations.\n\n\u201cRather than using their platform to denounce the Saudi regime\u2019s abuses, BTS chose to whitewash the regime\u2019s human rights violations by performing in Riyadh today.
