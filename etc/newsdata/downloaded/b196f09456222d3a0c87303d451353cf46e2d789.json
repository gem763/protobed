Trocsanyi was a key figure behind Hungarian laws that Brussels sees as undermining the rule of law in Hungary.\n\nThe Romanian nomination process has been delayed after its government was toppled by a vote of no-confidence on October 10.\n\nBucharest has been about to propose a replacement Rovana Plumb, who was quickly rejected by MEPs.\n\nThere is also a question over whether the UK will need to nominate a Commissioner. Despite Boris Johnson\u2019s insistence that Britain will leave the EU on Thursday evening, his government has been granted a Brexit extension of up to January 31.\n\nVon der Leyen has previously indicated that the UK will make a nomination in the event of a Brexit extension, although a decision has not yet been made.", "description": "The French businessman and Hungarian diplomat must still be approved by the MEPs, while the Romanian nomination remains vacant.", "authors": ["Alastair Jamieson"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/25/52/1000x563_cmsv2_07a158ac-bb97-5150-98be-770c0330fb81-4252552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
