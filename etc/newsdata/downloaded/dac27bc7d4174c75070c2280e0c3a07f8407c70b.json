This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.\n\nIn July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of a plan to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics, and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.\n\nRecently, the company made a six-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nTwitter and other social media platforms have also recently come under scrutiny over their ad policies.\n\nTwitter, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google this month was criticized by U.S. democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, for allowing politicians to run ads containing false or misleading claims.\n\nIn August, Twitter announced it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media outlets, shortly after it came under fire for showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nThe company also faced heat over its handling of user data when it said in October that email addresses and phone numbers uploaded by users to meet its security requirements may have been \u201cinadvertently\u201d used for advertising purposes.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed logo for Twitter is seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016.

Analysts had expected net income of $161.5 million.\n\nTotal operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 17% year-over-year to $780 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.\n\nTwitter expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.", "description": "Twitter Inc posted worse-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, plagued by unusually low demand over the summer and technical issues that hurt its advertising, sending its shares down about 19%.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444467495&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0V6", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
