She had an affinity for British comedy\u2014she boasts that she gave Jesse Armstrong (the creator of Succession) his first job in TV, adapting an ill-fated U.K. version of That \u201970s Show\u2014but not much else. She had faith, though, and more importantly, resolve. Mandabach, the Peaky Blinders writer Steven Knight told me, is \u201cone of those people who says things and says things until they\u2019re true. She makes them true.\u201d\n\nOn its face, Peaky Blinders wasn\u2019t the most obvious project for Mandabach to will into existence. The story of the Shelbys\u2014a family of gangsters from Birmingham in the British Midlands in the period following World War I\u2014is defiantly, aggressively British. Not in the PBS-enshrined, plummily accented, gilt-and-gentility mode that Mandabach describes as \u201cBrand Britain.\u201d Rather, Peaky Blinders is all flattened vowels, tweed newsboy caps, and unadulterated masculinity. Its central gang, known for the razor blades its members stash in their headwear, is troubled and supremely violent. The show\u2019s signature recurring shot depicts the Shelby family swaggering in slow motion to anachronistic rock hits by Jack White and the Arctic Monkeys.\n\nAnd yet when Knight first pitched Mandabach his idea, in the caf\u00e9 at London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall where she took all her meetings, she saw something she knew. \u201cLike Steve Knight, I have a vague gangster background,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut only vague.\u201d Mandabach grew up in Chicago in the 1950s and \u201960s, where her father was an inveterate gambler who she says got in so deep with the mob that he was forced to fake his death and disappear to the Philippines for 10 years. She was, she said, \u201craised by wolves,\u201d which is what she insists set her up for a career in show business. In Birmingham, a much-maligned industrial city 100 miles northeast of London, she saw echoes of Chicago, America\u2019s perennial Second City. And in Peaky\u2019s Tommy Shelby, played by Cillian Murphy, she saw an antiheroic character more in the American dramatic mold than the prototypical British hero. While Brits tend to do grand \u201cstate of the nation\u201d storytelling, she said, Americans do \u201cstate of Walter White\u2019s head.\u201d Peaky is all about Tommy\u2019s psyche, and how repressed emotions in male communities tend to manifest as violent behavior.\n\nPeaky\u2019s first season attracted an average of 2.4 million viewers per episode in the U.K., a respectable draw for a series on BBC Two, the corporation\u2019s more \u201chighbrow\u201d channel. (For the show\u2019s fifth season this year, it was moved to the nation\u2019s flagship channel, BBC One, where the finale pulled in more than 4 million viewers.) But when the first two seasons arrived on Netflix late in 2014, the show started drawing a cult following. The rapper Snoop Dogg, Mandabach said, was \u201cour first fan love letter.\u201d David Beckham was already a fan. Steven Spielberg and Stephen King expressed their enthusiasm. So did Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, and A$AP Rocky. Peaky has a big fan base in Uruguay and Saudi Arabia, Mandabach says. The series\u2019 international acclaim via Netflix has affirmed that Mandabach\u2019s gamble was worth it. But the circumstances that led her to leave the U.S. have had a broader impact on TV as we know it.", "description": "Caryn Mandabach spearheaded such prime-time comedies as Roseanne, The Cosby Show, and 3rd Rock From the Sun.
