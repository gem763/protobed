Its occupants fled the scene.\n\n\n\nPolice said in a statement that the 23-year-old victim, Sean D Kealiher, was taken to a local hospital by associates.\n\n\n\nThe Multnomah county medical examiner determined the cause of death to be homicide, caused by blunt force trauma. Police said homicide squad detectives would investigate and called on witnesses to come forward.\n\n\n\nKealiher was a prominent participant in antifascist and anti-Trump protests in Portland, speaking and marching in opposition to events held by rightwing groups. His activities occasionally attracted the attention of rightwing bloggers and social media personalities.\n\n\n\nRose City Antifa, the city\u2019s longest-standing antifascist group, said in a tweet addressing Kealiher\u2019s death that it \u201cwas not related to fascist activity\u201d.\n\n\n\nPolice did not specify a motive.\n\n\n\nPortland mayor Ted Wheeler and the Oregon Democratic party, outside whose building the incident happened, expressed condolences on Twitter. Memorial tributes were laid at the site.\n\n\n\nSix men, including Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson, are awaiting trial on charges arising from a violent incident at Cider Riot on 1 May.\n\n\n\nIn an affidavit in support of Gibson\u2019s arrest warrant, police officer Brad Kalbaugh described the group approaching Cider Riot \u201cin an effort clearly designed to provoke a physical confrontation\u201d.\n\n\n\nMultiple videos of that incident show punches, thrown drinks and pepper spray being exchanged. One of the men awaiting trial, Ian Kramer, is alleged to have struck a woman with a baton, fracturing her vertebra.\n\n\n\nMore video appears to show members of the group planning violence ahead of the brawl. Gibson and the other men are charged with riot. Some face felony assault charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCider Riot\u2019s owner, Abram Goldman-Armstrong, has commenced a $1m lawsuit against Gibson and several others.\n\n\n\nGoldman-Armstrong\u2019s lawyer, Juan Chavez, says his client has been subject to \u201chomophobic and antisemitic\u201d harassment since the suit was filed.\n\n\n\n", "description": "City\u2019s antifascist group says death of Sean D Kealiher, 23, was not \u2018related to fascist activity\u2019 and police did not specify a motiveThe Multnomah county medical examiner determined the cause of death to be homicide, caused by blunt force trauma.
