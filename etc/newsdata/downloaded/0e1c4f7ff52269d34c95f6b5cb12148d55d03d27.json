Trump acknowledged urging an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter by releasing a summary of the call. \u201cIt sounds horrible to me,\u201d Trump said to Zelensky about the Bidens.\n\nMick Mulvaney: Mick Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up aid to pressure Ukraine, then rows back\n\nBiden, a leading Democratic presidential contender in 2020, has denied wrongdoing. Ukrainian officials have said there was no basis for allegations against the Bidens.\n\nWitnesses before the three House panels \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 focused the impeachment spotlight on a central question: Was Trump justified in withholding nearly $400 million in military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of corruption, or did that demand qualify for removing the president from office? The answer among lawmakers broke down sharply along partisan lines.\n\nTrump insisted he was absolutely justified in fighting corruption in Ukraine. Republican lawmakers defended Trump for fighting corruption while not explicitly demanding an investigation of the Bidens in exchange for military aid during the call.\n\n\u201cI am personally of the opinion that our country should absolutely be working together to go after corruption, and the Biden family scheme in Ukraine is one that my constituents have an issue with, the president of the United States has an issue with, we have an issue with,\u201d Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., said Tuesday.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announces that the G7 will be held at Trump National Doral on Oct. 17, 2019. More\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday the military aid was withheld in exchange for Ukraine investigating the hacking of a Democratic National Committee computer server in 2016, and to assist a Justice Department review of that election interference, rather than targeting the Bidens. Mulvaney later issued a statement denying any quid pro quo exchanging military aid for an investigation. But in front of reporters, Mulvaney said trade-offs are common in diplomacy.\n\n\u201cGet over it,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters, in a message the Trump campaign began selling Friday on T-shirts.\n\nNASA: Trump calls NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch to congratulate them on first all-female spacewalk\n\nBut House Democrats said Trump\u2019s demand for an investigation \u2013 while naming the Bidens as targets \u2013 at the same time he withheld military aid could be grounds for impeachment. The administration\u2019s defiance of congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony could also be grounds for impeachment as examples of obstruction of justice.\n\n\"The reality is, as much as there's a lot of focus on a quid pro quo, I just want to remind everyone, you do not need a quid pro quo,\" Rep. David Cicilline said. \"The United States asking a foreign leader to interfere in an American presidential election is illegal, un-American, unpatriotic and in it of itself constitutes grounds for impeachment.\"", "description": "Witnesses in House impeachment inquiry called President Donald Trump's Ukraine policy \"crazy\" under personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qaxrdBDF1dI.UmBzBY6Ymg--~B/aD0zMjM4O3c9NDg1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/8f8807376265b62b3e1a7fa9e875dd3c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
