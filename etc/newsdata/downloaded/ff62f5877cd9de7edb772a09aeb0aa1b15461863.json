And if you\u2019re shopping for older kids, we\u2019ve got gift guides for all ages, including 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds, 5-year-olds, 7-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and 11-year-olds.\n\nGreen Toys Shape Sorter \u201cPuzzles exercise children\u2019s cognitive abilities to be able to think about both the physical manipulation of the pieces and understanding how something will fit into something else,\u201d says Lytle. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea of containment and fitting and what goes where.\u201d $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nMelissa and Doug Rainbow Caterpillar Gear Toy $9 (was $10, now 10% off) Simple peg puzzles are just as exciting as shape sorters for growing toddlers, especially if they involve more than one way to interact and experiment. This gear toy offers babies the option of both turning the gears to make the caterpillar move and removing and putting the pieces back in place. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the retailer Fat Brain Toys Tobbles Neo Stackable cups and toys like this grippy tower also promote the concepts of containment, pieces fitting together, and manipulation, all important aspects in a child\u2019s development, according to Lytle. The weighted, cracked-egg-like components can not only be stacked but also toppled, spun, and balanced. $27 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nHape Pound & Tap Bench With Slide Out Xylophone $27 (was $30, now 10% off) Children can learn to explore the world through a number of toys \u2014 or simply through simple household items like pots and pans. For parents and caregivers, the important thing is to facilitate this experimentation. Says Lytle: \u201cYou really want parents to be there playing with their children, following their lead, allowing them to figure out what happens, and asking them questions about it like, \u2018Oh my gosh, did you see that? Did you see what happened? Do you think that would happen if we did it again?\u2019 If you think about it, asking those questions get at the scientific method.\u201d No wonder this award-winning toy is beloved by parents and children everywhere. In addition to being a musical instrument, it allows kids to experiment with cause and effect. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nBoon Building Bath Pipes Toy Set $10 (was $15, now 33% off) In the same way they enjoy stacking, dropping, and hitting things, 1-year-olds love emptying containers and filling them back up again. This set of tubes you can suction to the side of the tub allows kids to experiment while in the bath, and each piece has a different moving part that\u2019s activated by water. \u201cThe idea that there are moving parts goes right along with that curiosity of the in, out, up, and down,\u201d says MacLaughlin. \u201cMoving parts are pretty attractive to a 1-year-old, which is why you\u2019ll find them going after everything in your home that\u2019s not a toy.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nManhattan Toy Skwish Color Burst Grasping Activity Toy $11 (was $15, now 27% off) Engaging sensory toys make great stroller accessories because they can soothe a bored baby when you\u2019re stuck in line or on the subway. \u201cI\u2019m sure the temptation for a lot of parents is to hand them something like an iPhone that makes a lot of noise. But the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) doesn\u2019t recommend consuming electronic stimuli in that way for children under 2 years old,\u201d explains MacLaughlin. This squishy bead toy will hold their attention and stimulate their motor-skill development. \u201cIt\u2019s like a more sophisticated rattle. It rattles when you shake it but it also has beads that move around the bars, and it has a sensory aspect to it.\u201d MacLaughlin recommends attaching any stroller toys to the stroller, lest they get chucked into the street by a gravity-curious baby. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nElephant Sshlumpie Blanket Plush in Gray At 12 months, children are learning about patterns in the world, which also extends to routines. Predictable routines, like ones at nighttime, for example, \u201cboth help them feel very safe and secure, but also help them learn about the world and learn what to expect next,\u201d says Lytle. This feeling of security can also come from stuffed animals, because at this age, children are capable of forming relationships with nonhumans, even characters on a favorite show. A familiar doll or toy can add an element of predictability in a situation that may be foreign. \u201cObjects and dolls can\u2019t respond to the child, but it is something that makes them feel secure,\u201d she adds. Even if they don\u2019t know what is going on around them, they will feel safe knowing that they have their favorite toy in their arms. Try this elephant Sshlumpie, which is not only a cuddly companion for a 1-year-old but also a great toy that can be taken on the go. $20 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nJellycat Odell Octopus For the 1-year-old who already has a stuffed bear, dog, and elephant, this plush pink octopus could make a great addition to their imaginary family. Its eight furry arms stretch and bounce back, making it the perfect new \u201chand-holding\u201d pal. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nIndigo Jamm Colin\u2019s Camper Van Playset This vintage-inspired, all-sustainable-wood camper play set comes with four peg people and a pet dog ready to hit the road \u2014 or the front hall. \u201cOne-year-olds are just figuring out how they can influence the world around them, so they love putting things into containers and taking them out,\u201d says Lytle. \u201cThis really speaks to that urge. It\u2019s also nice that it\u2019s a bus because a child that young is more likely to have been in a car or bus than a boat or plane, so this is more relatable.\u201d $50 at Jamm Toys Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nRadio Flyer Classic Wagon Walker $79 (was $80, now 1% off) \u201cAt 1, kids are probably starting to pull themselves up on furniture and maybe even take a couple of steps,\u201d explains Lytle. \u201cWhen they\u2019re up and walking, they\u2019re most interested in toys that might support them but can also be part of their playtime.\u201d Try this classic toy that an early (or soon-to-be) walker can operate on their own, while toting around their most prized belongings, slash some Cheerios. $79 at Amazon Buy $79 at Amazon Buy\n\nDear Zoo, by Rod Campbell $4 (was $7, now 43% off) This classic board book \u2014 it was published in 1982 \u2014 has lift-the-flap options on every page, but it shows easy-to-digest animal images that kids can recognize. \u201cOne of the things we know about 1-year-olds is that they really thrive on interacting with adults, so books that encourage that interaction and allow parents to give in to that moment beyond just reading the page are the best,\u201d says Lytle. \u201cBooks that involve sounds the parent can make and children can imitate, or a book that has windows you can open and talk about, or anything else to that effect are best.\u201d $4 at Amazon Buy $4 at Amazon Buy\n\nCRASH! BOOM! A Math Tale, by Robie H. Harris $13 (was $16, now 19% off) \u201cMost 1-year-olds have recently become quite mobile and they\u2019re very, very curious, so something that is repetitive and has a rhythmic cadence to it is more likely to keep their attention.\u201d This book about an elephant stacking blocks mirrors a familiar activity as well as \u201claying the groundwork for early math, science and music skills,\u201d says MacLaughlin. $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nTegu Magnetic Blocks \u201cThere\u2019s actually been some research looking at kids using blocks with parents, and it turns out that building blocks are a really good way to promote early STEM skills,\u201d says Lytle. \u201cThink about the language you\u2019re using when you\u2019re building blocks: bigger, smaller, shorter, taller. If you have kids and parents building bridges with blocks together, you\u2019ll start talking about concepts like stability. Even if you don\u2019t actually use the word stability, you\u2019re still talking about complex engineering concepts.\u201d The pastel-hued wooden building blocks in this 14-piece set have built-in magnets, so they won\u2019t fall down as easily as regular blocks. Plus, they\u2019re made in Honduras, with the goal of creating living-wage jobs for Tegucigalpa residents. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nAoile Wooden Nesting Rainbow Blocks This colorful wooden set of blocks can often be found in Montessori and Waldorf classrooms alongside more basic rectangular versions. Each arc in this nesting set can be stacked, balanced, and combined with the others to create imaginary city scenes with bridges and buildings, or simply to experiment with texture and gravity. \u201cStacking is fun, but even if they\u2019re not coordinated enough to stack their toys, they would love to watch you stack, and then be able to knock it down,\u201d says MacLaughlin. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nBaby Einstein Magic Touch Wooden Piano \u201cYoung kids love to making music and noises and exploring things, like, \u2018Can I make it softer? Can I make it louder?\u2019 Lytle says. \u2018What happens when I hit it harder? Does that make it louder?\u2019 That\u2019s a really interesting learning process.\u201d Tap the colored keys on Baby Einstein\u2019s Magic Touch Piano to play classic tunes or create your own melodies \u2014 a great way for babies and parents to play together. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Buy Buy Baby Buy\n\nJanod Rocky the Dog Pull Toy $25 (was $35, now 29% off) \u201cAt 1 year, kids might just be starting to walk, so they\u2019re interested in toys that can walk with them and encourage them to keep going,\u201d says Lytle. There\u2019s little that is cuter than watching a new walker pull their wobbly new best friend behind them. Janod\u2019s Rocky the Dog Pull Toy has a tail that wags as he moseys around the house. $25 at Amazon Buy $25 at Amazon Buy\n\nPidoko Kids Multi Activity Center Tree This activity center features tracks for wooden beads, with hidden animals that will keep tots busy for hours. \u201cOne of the things I always like to look for in a toy is one that allows kids a lot of options, not only in terms of things to do, but in ways to do them,\u201d says Lytle. \u201cBecause at this age you want a child to learn by figuring out the pathway to using the toy and not necessarily direct them with a specific set of rules. A toy like this has a lot of different options, so they can do things like move the beads and just explore around the whole toy. They\u2019ll always find a new feature and something new to do.\u201d $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
