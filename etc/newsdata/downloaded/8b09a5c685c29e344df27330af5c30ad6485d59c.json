Honestly, by the time I got here, I was just so tired.\"\n\nOsaka added: \"I definitely think last year helped me in the way that I kind of know the format more. Before last year, I haven't played round-robin since I was, like, eight or 10.\"\n\nOsaka begins her challenge at the $14 million event against Petra Kvitova after being drawn against the Czech as well as world No.1 Ashleigh Barty and Belinda Bencic in the Red Group.\n\nPlayers face off against one another in the round-robin format, with the top two in each group progressing to Saturday's semi-finals.\n\n\"I think it should be fun,\" she said of Sunday's match against Kvitova, who she defeated in the final of the Australian Open.\n\n\"I think she's one of the players, few players, that sort of treat you very nicely after the match no matter if she wins or loses. She always gives you a smile.\n\nOsaka comes into the event off the back of a successful run during the WTA's Asian swing.\n\nMaintaining her on-court discipline has been key, she said.\n\n\"I tried to be as focused as I could every point, which for me is something very difficult to do because my mind tends to wander a lot. I think you can see it sometimes,\" she said.\n\n\"So just continuing that, trying to be as focused as I can. I think I don't have much of a choice here because I'm playing against the best players.\" (Editing by Alison Williams )", "description": "SHENZHEN, China, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Twelve months on from her debut appearance at the WTA Finals, two-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka is hoping to put the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
