The misapprehension he is winning comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the race. The 2020 Democratic contest is not one between Mr. Biden and another candidate, but one between Mr. Biden and \u201cthe field.\u201d That \u201cfield\u201d is \u201cleft\u201d and pulling away from Mr. Biden.\n\nAccording to Real Clear Politics\u2019 average of national polling, prior to the first debate (6/6-25), Mr. Biden stood at 32 percent, Bernie Sanders at 16.9 percent, and Elizabeth Warren at 12.8 percent. Currently (8/9-25), Mr. Biden stands at 27.5 percent, Mr. Sanders at 16.7 percent and Ms. Warren at 16.2 percent. The general perception is Mr. Biden still holds a double-digit lead and is winning handily.\n\nSeeing the race that way is to miss its true dynamic. Instead, look at the collective left \u2014 everyone else except Mr. Biden, Steve Bullock and Joe Donnelly. The collective establishment dropped from 33.2 percent to 28.7 percent; the collective left rose from 55 percent to 59.9 percent.\n\nFrom this perspective, the takeaways are very different. The gap between Mr. Biden and the left has grown; he now trails by more than 2-1. Even with John Hickenlooper\u2019s departure and the moderate field shrinking to three, there is little prospect of Mr. Biden gaining, because there is little there to gain.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 2020 presidential primary contest is one of its vanishing establishment against its ascendant left. In reality, it is not a contest.\n\nThere is no establishment camp besides Mr. Biden. Currently, it comprises just three candidates totaling just 28.7 percent of support \u2014 barely 1 percent higher than Mr. Biden alone.\n\nEven with Mr. Biden\u2019s limited support, it is questionable how much exists for him and the establishment beyond a mistaken belief in his ability to beat Donald Trump. Mr. Biden\u2019s and the establishment\u2019s \u201celectability\u201d argument is further undermined by polling showing candidates from the left also doing well against Mr, Trump: Why should Democrats pick a candidate the majority clearly do not want, if they also do not need him?\n\nAs bad as Mr. Biden is doing, it will get worse quickly because the 2020 contest\u2019s rule will further undercut his minority candidacy. Long gone are the days of winner-take-all primaries when Mr. Biden could have won all a contest\u2019s delegates by winning the most votes.\n\nDemocrats today award their delegates proportionally. This means Mr. Biden could stay at his current level throughout the primaries, winning every one, and still finish with just 27.5 percent of the delegates. Of course, he will not, but even if should, it would be irrelevant to the outcome.\n\nWhat instead will happen is that as the field shrinks, the left will coalesce around a shrinking group of their candidates. Already this is happening: Just Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders combined easily surpass Mr. Biden. However, this is small potatoes compared to what is coming.\n\nCurrently, there is another 27 percent of Democrats supporting other candidates on the left. As those candidates fall away, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders (and any other survivors), will see their numbers grow, while Mr. Biden at best stays where he is. What is assured: They will not go to Mr. Biden. The evidence for this is clear: They are not now.\n\nThe left will keep growing and denying Mr. Biden \u2014 even should they not knock him out. If Mr. Biden survives to the end \u2014 because proportional awarding of delegates could allow him to do so too \u2014 he cannot expect any help at the convention.\n\nA brokered convention is not out of the question, but a Biden nomination still is. Democratic super delegates, those establishment-dominated free agents who had assured Hillary Clinton of 2016\u2019s nomination before a vote was cast, will not be allowed to vote on the first ballot. So, even if the left have not settled on a single candidate when the primaries end, they will still have time to come together in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nEffectively, super delegates also will be blocked from voting for Mr. Biden on a later ballot too. Imagine the rebellion if the establishment candidate with less than the support of one-third of Democrats and ideologically out of step with the remaining two-thirds (and who also fails their identity-politics test by being old, white and male) was somehow awarded the nomination.\n\nThe Democrats are playing down their party\u2019s split and the establishment media is playing along. Both are desperately trying to prop up Mr. Biden for two reasons: There is no establishment candidate besides Mr. Biden and, without an establishment, there is no nationally viable party. Simply: Democrats cannot win nationally as a liberal-only party.\n\nYet, consider the Democratic establishment\u2019s prospects. In 2016, there was Hillary; she lost in arguably America\u2019s biggest presidential upset. Four years later, there is Mr. Biden; he has the support of well less than one-third of Democrats. After 2020, there is no one; the rest of the establishment field is two other candidates collectively drawing 1 percent support.\n\nMr. Biden is already losing. The Democrats\u2019 establishment is losing even more. And, the Democratic Party is poised to lose most of all.\n\n\u2022 J.T.
