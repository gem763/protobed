Miller/The Gazette via AP 2020 elections Buttigieg fights to lock down Iowa LGBTQ vote Activists say they want to hear more from the South Bend mayor about LGBTQ issues as they survey the 2020 field.\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 Friday\u2019s LGBTQ Presidential Forum had the feeling of a home game for Pete Buttigieg, who was introduced as \u201ca member of our community\u201d to a rousing standing ovation. But that enthusiasm for Buttigieg has not guaranteed him a lock on this voting bloc in Iowa.\n\nButtigieg covered topics including learning \u201cthe hard way\u201d about \u201cdiscrimination\u201d when he came out \u2014 like the first time he saw his mayoral office\u2019s annual blood drive on his schedule, Buttigieg said, and soon realized, \u201cI can\u2019t be part of it.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYet some activists in Iowa said that Buttigieg had not focused enough attention in his campaign on the unique challenges faced by LGBTQ people. Even amid obvious enthusiasm for the South Bend, Ind., mayor, who faced a crowd waving rainbow \u201cBOOT-EDGE-EDGE\u201d signs and featuring \u201cPete\u201d stickers on dozens of T-shirts, the pressure for Buttigieg to represent the broader LGBTQ community through his 2020 campaign has come with complications.\n\n\u201cLGBTQ Iowans are not a monolith and everyone has different priorities. There aren\u2019t many who are ready to fully commit yet. That\u2019s something he needs to be very aware of when he speaks to this community,\u201d said Erica Barz, the communications director of One Iowa, a pro-LGBTQ group, which co-sponsored the forum with GLAAD. \u201cThey\u2019re not automatically behind him.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has not always put his sexual orientation at the center of his presidential bid, rather listing it as one of several aspects that makes him unique in the sprawling 2020 presidential field. Though he shot to prominence partly by criticizing Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s attitude toward same-sex marriage, he now will tick through a number of biographical labels as he introduces himself on the trail: millennial, gay, left-handed, veteran, mayor.\n\nIn his memoir, \u201cThe Shortest Way Home,\u201d Buttigieg wrote about coming out, worrying that though he had \u201csupported the causes from the beginning,\u201d he \u201cdid not want to be defined by them.\u201d\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s campaign is about so much more than the fact that he\u2019d be the first openly gay president,\u201d said Virginia Rep. Don Beyer, who endorsed Buttigieg earlier this year. \u201cI think he\u2019s humble and wise enough to realize that just because he\u2019s in a happy marriage to Chasten doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be the first choice for everyone in the LGBT community.\u201d\n\nInstead, Buttigieg\u2019s approach reflects advice given by the Victory Fund, a pro-LGBTQ political group: \u201cWe tell all our candidates, and what Pete clearly understands, is that being gay or lesbian or transgender is who you are and has to be a part of your narrative, but it\u2019s not your resume, and it\u2019s not a reason why someone would support you,\u201d said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who now serves as the Victory Fund\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cNot everybody agrees with his positions, not everybody in the LGBTQ community is going to support him and we don\u2019t expect that,\u201d said Parker, who is among nearly 60 mayors and former mayors who have endorsed Buttigieg. \u201cBut there is a core base of LGBTQ support that has propelled him.\u201d\n\nThat includes significant financial support. Buttigieg raised nearly $25 million last quarter, a stunning haul that vaulted him into the upper tier of the presidential race. And LGBTQ donors served as an early foundation for Buttigieg\u2019s bid.\n\nBut activists in Iowa expressed concern that Buttigieg didn\u2019t put LGBTQ issues and challenges more at the center of his policy prescriptions, as well as acknowledging the intersectionality of the community\u2019s challenges.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much in policy or in talking about issues that pertains to this community, especially the trans community, so I know there\u2019s been a lot of disappointment around that,\u201d said Kasi Rupert, president of the Linden County Stonewall Democrats. \u201cA lot of people want him to take more responsibility in talking about the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Medina, another LGBTQ activist based in Iowa, is \u201ceager for Buttigieg to talk more to those of us who are people of color and LGBTQ,\u201d adding that the mayor \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a lock on support,\u201d but \u201cthat could change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if he had put in a little more effort on grassroots investment in his own community, showing up here, it would\u2019ve played out differently,\u201d Medina said.\n\nIndeed, POLITICO obtained email documentation that Buttigieg\u2019s campaign had initially declined an invitation to the LGBTQ forum Friday night, sponsored by GLAAD and One Iowa. But Buttigieg ultimately decided to participate.\n\nButtigieg did address some of those issues raised by activists in his comments Friday night, pledging to \u201cend the war on trans Americans\u201d by eliminating the ban on trans military members and to signing the Equality Act, a bill that prohibits discrimination on the base of sex orientation or gender identity, \u201cas soon as it hits my desk.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

In part, Democrats suggested, that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t much daylight among the candidates on these issues. Another LGBTQ-centered event, hosted by the Human Rights Campaign and airing on CNN, will take place in Los Angles next month.\n\nOn Friday night, Sen. Cory Booker called for a \u201cwoke president on these issues,\u201d while Sen. Kamala Harris explained why she as California\u2019s attorney general refused to defend Proposition 8, which eliminated the rights of same-sex couples to marry. Sen. Elizabeth Warren recited all 18 names of the transgender women of color who were killed, so far, in 2019. Former Vice President Joe Biden applauded all those in the audiences for \u201chaving the courage to come out,\u201d though he still had a testy exchange with the moderator over his position on the 1994 crime bill.\n\nBut Buttigieg, for many of the voters streaming out of the auditorium Friday night, was the bright spot. Partly, for his representation, but also because \u201che brings me a lot of hope,\u201d said Caleb Mehl, an 18-year-old student at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\n\u201cAs someone who is bi-[sexual], I know I can trust him,\u201d Mehl said. \u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s light coming out of all this darkness.\u201d", "description": "Activists say they want to hear more from the South Bend mayor about LGBTQ issues as they survey the 2020 field.", "authors": ["Elena Schneider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ed/93/2bf6c68643b88401854e90688642/190921-pete-buttigieg-lbgtq-iowa-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
