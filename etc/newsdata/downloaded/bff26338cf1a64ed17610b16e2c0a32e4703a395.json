It's within a two-hour flight of 80% of the United States population of more than 300 million people.\n\nThere was no change from 2017 in the rankings of the top three passenger airports.\n\nComing in second place, Beijing Capital International Airport passed the 100 million passengers mark in 2018, hitting nearly 101 million passengers and growing by 5.4%. Third place Dubai Airport handled 89 million passengers, increasing by only 1%.
