Tedo Abzhandadze converted to make it 12-0.\n\nUruguay then took advantage of a lapse in the lineout defense from the Georgians, allowing center Andres Vilaseca to cross after a getting an inside ball from a strong running Rodrigo Silva.\n\nFelipe Berchesi converted and had a chance to close the gap further but missed a penalty attempt late in the half and Georgia led 12-7 at the break.\n\nFurther underscoring Georgia\u2019s advantage in the pack, prop Levan Chilachava barged over three minutes after halftime to complete a simple move down the short side.\n\nBregvadze also scored from close range, then livened up the crowd with his chip kick that resulted in points, but may not get the blessing of his coach.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jaba Bregvadze gave Georgian and Japanese fans a bonus cheer when he scored a try and set up another with a chip kick to lead his lineup to a 33-7 victory over Uruguay in a Rugby World Cup Pool D game on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
