(Image: HBO)\n\nHBO\u2019s Watchmen is set 30 years after the events of Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore\u2019s original comics series, meaning that most of the story\u2019s original heroes and villains are long since dead, inactive, or in Doctor Manhattan\u2019s case, hanging out off-planet away from humanity. But Watchmen\u2019s world is one that\u2019s been fundamentally changed by the legacies of both generations of the Minutemen.\n\nRorschach is one of the most obvious and striking examples of HBO\u2019s Watchmen continuing the story of an original character by taking their identity and recontextualising it in a new, distinct narrative.\n\nWalter Joseph Kovacs the man is dead, but Rorschach the idea lives on in the form of the Seventh Kavalry, a white terrorist organisation operating out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, whose vicious attacks on the city\u2019s black population prompt the government to allow the police department to begin hiding their identities.\n\nWhile the 7K proudly wear Rorschach masks, their ideology is somewhat different than Kovacs\u2019 in that their moral absolutism is defined by an explicitly racist worldview and a desire for ethnic cleaning.\n\nAt one point in the series\u2019 first episode, members of the 7K share a video warning the police that they\u2019ll be coming for them, and the entire production borrows heavily from Rorschach\u2019s speech in Watchmen\u2019s first issue. It\u2019s a chilling, frightening moment that makes you understand what the Tulsa PD\u2019s up against, but it also illustrates how Rorschach\u2019s come to mean something somewhat different in society.\n\nAs intentionally disturbing as a character as the original Rorschach was, he\u2019s gone on to become a fan favourite, which Watchmen\u2019s creative team knew could potentially be a point of consternation when the series begins airing this fall.\n\nBut at this year\u2019s New York Comic Con panel for the show, artist and Watchmen co-creator Dave Gibbons explained that when he first had a chance to read Damon Lindelof\u2019s scripts, he completely understood why Rorschach as a concept was being introduced this way:\n\n\u201cRorschach is a very interesting character, you know? Obviously, Alan [Moore] very much came up with Rorschach and wrote all the words that came from his mouth, and I think there\u2019s a dreadful appeal to characters like Rorschach in that you can\u2019t possibly agree with them. But they\u2019re so definite, and so consistent, and so hypnotically sure of what they\u2019re doing that they\u2019re quite arresting. And I can quite see that Rorschach would be a kind of role model for people with unpleasant views in this future.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to grasp why most comics creators, and the studios making big-budget productions based on the creators\u2019 works, are hesitant to wholly embrace the idea that their characters, in any way, speak to the negative elements of society. The assumption is that acknowledging that fact could be perceived as an endorsement of bad behaviour on the show\u2019s behalf.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen more than a number of examples of people \u2014 often police officers \u2014 taking the wrong message from things like comic books and co-opting the imagery associated with certain characters in order to send chilling, dangerous messages.\n\nThe fact that Gibbons immediately grasped when Watchmen\u2019s trying to do with his creation speaks to the show\u2019s ability to put its money where its mouth is, and actually game out the future of this universe in a way that reflects the realities of our society. Whether the show can manage to maintain that solid grasp on its story and be entertaining all throughout, though, remains to be seen.\n\nWatchmen premieres on Fox Showcase on October 21.", "description": "HBO\u2019s Watchmen is set 30 years after the events of Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore\u2019s original comics series, meaning that most of the story\u2019s original heroes and villains are long since dead, inactive, or in Doctor Manhattan\u2019s case, hanging out off-planet away from humanity.
