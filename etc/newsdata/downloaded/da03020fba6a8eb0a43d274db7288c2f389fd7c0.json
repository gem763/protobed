Most of the government entities are security bureaus, while the eight firms are primarily AI-driven companies with applications that can be used for surveillance.\n\nMegvii's main Chinese competitors SenseTime and Yitu were also listed, as was voice recognition company iFlytek and security camera giant Hikvision.\n\nUnited Nations experts and activists say at least 1 million Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. Beijing denies any mistreatment at the camps, which it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\nIt has been reported that Megvii technology has helped police make thousands of arrests in China. However, the US document that blacklists the companies doesn't detail its involvement in Xinjiang.\n\nIn June, Human Rights Watch withdrew a previous allegation that a smartphone app used to track ethnic Uighurs used Megvii's technology. While the company's code was found in the app, it was inoperable.\n\nRepression concerns\n\nMegvii will be the first Chinese artificial intelligence firm to go public if its Hong Kong listing goes ahead. The Alibaba-backed tech company, which previously traded under the name Face++, is best known for its facial recognition technology.\n\nIt's products are used in Huawei, Xiaomi and Vivo phones and Lenovo laptops. In China, it's widely used to unlock smartphones and make mobile payments.\n\nImage copyright Megvii\n\nDidi Chuxing's ride-hailing app uses the technology to let passengers check the driver's identity. The blacklist could have a significant impact, as it bars the companies from buying US technology without prior US government approval.\n\nThat could limit the access of China's AI companies to US-made made microchips, upon which they're currently heavily reliant.\n\nGoldman's decision to review its involvement in the IPO comes amid growing concern about the use of facial recognition software. A number of US states and cities have already banned government use of the technology, while several members of congress are pushing a bill look at the issue federally.\n\nIt's also an issue in Hong Kong, where protestors engaged in the current unrest are using a combination of high and low tech methods to elude police surveillance.\n\nThe US move could also cast a pall over ministerial-level trade talks this week between the US and China.\n\nThe eight blacklisted Chinese companies are not the only ones to face the ire of the US government. Washington has previously imposed similar restrictions on other Chinese companies, notably smartphone maker Huawei, on national security grounds.", "description": "Goldman Sachs is advising Megvii, but the US has put the Chinese AI firm on a human rights blacklist.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/133DA/production/_108501887_46fee39a-404e-4b28-b1b6-584a3e77a0ea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
