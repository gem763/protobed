The ball did not clear the fence, and had a replay review been conducted, Narvaez would have been awarded a double and the game would have continued tied at 1.\n\n\u201cIn last night\u2019s game there was conversation between the umpires and the White Sox as to the procedure for potentially reviewing two different aspects of the game-ending play,\u201d MLB said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThere was then a misinterpretation regarding Chicago\u2019s desire to have any aspect of the play reviewed. We regret that this miscommunication resulted in not reviewing the home run call on the field.\u201d\n\nWhite Sox manager Rick Renteria said he immediately asked umpires to review the homer, and they then went to the headset used to communicate with replay officials.\n\nWhen Renteria and the umpires reconvened, they asked if Renteria wanted to challenge whether Narvaez had touched home plate amid his celebrating teammates. Renteria mistakenly thought this meant officials had ruled the ball cleared the fence and declined to challenge whether Narvaez touched home, because he had already seen on replays that he had.\n\nRenteria agreed there was a \u201cmiscommunication or misunderstanding.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what the umpires discussed on the headset. MLB declined to make the crew available before Sunday\u2019s game, instead issuing the statement.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major League Baseball has expressed \"regret\" over a miscommunication that resulted in a 2-1 loss for the Chicago White Sox against the Seattle Mariners on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Chris Talbott"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/white_sox_mariners_baseball_57971_c0-152-2978-1888_s1770x1032.jpg?e7717f1ca5632ab7d91e64bd2ef0e77b734ff46d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
