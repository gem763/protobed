The White House/Handout via Reuters\n\nThe Oct. 9 letter was released by the White House on Wednesday as Trump battled to control the political damage following his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, clearing the way for the Turkish incursion against America\u2019s Kurdish allies.\n\nThe letter tried to persuade Erdogan to reverse a decision to invade Syria that Erdogan told Trump about in an Oct 6 phone call.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy - and I will.\u201d\n\nTrump had the letter released to bolster his view that he did not give Turkey a green light to invade Syria. Many lawmakers have been sharply critical of his decision to remove American forces from the conflict zone.\n\n\u201cI have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don\u2019t let the world down. You can make a great deal,\u201d said Trump in the letter.\n\nThe president wrote that the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, was willing to negotiate and to make some concessions.\n\nHe said he had confidentially enclosed to Erdogan a copy of a letter Mazloum had sent him.\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d said Trump.\n\nHe added: \u201cI will call you later.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump warned Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a letter about Turkey's incursion into Syria, \"Don't be a tough guy\" and \"Don't be a fool!\"", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441641230&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1Y9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
