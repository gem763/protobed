According to statements provided to the LA Times, and confirmed by Variety, Quibi CEO Meg Whitman specifically called out T-Mobile\u2019s \u201cimpressive 5G road map\u201d as a good fit for the soon-to-launch streaming service.\n\nThe partnership will give T-Mobile\u2019s 83.1 million customers access to Quibi\u2019s premium content, but no details as to how it would be bundled into the carrier\u2019s plans are currently available. It\u2019s possible that Quibi will either be offered at a discount for T-Mobile users, or it could be available as an add-on or available with a special bundle deal.\n\nThe deal will present a new competitor to AT&T\u2019s streaming services, AT&T TV Now (previously DirecTV Now) and low-cost WatchTV, as well as its upcoming premium service, HBO Max. Verizon (TechCrunch\u2019s parent company) also dabbled with mobile streaming with go90, but that service was shut down last year after failing to gain adoption.\n\nThe news of the T-Mobile deal comes on the heels of a series of rapid-fire announcements about the shows and celebs who will be contributing to Quibi, which will provide a range of programming, including news, lifestyle, comedy, drama, horror, reality, action and more. And all is broken up into shorter-form bits \u2014 or \u201cquick bites,\u201d hence the service\u2019s name.\n\nAs for the programming, Quibi has brought in big names like Sam Raimi, Guillermo del Toro, Antoine Fuqua and producer Jason Blum, Liam Hemsworth, Lorne Michaels, Steven Speilberg, Tyra Banks, Idris Elba, Trevor Noah, Queen Latifah, Sophie Turner and others.\n\n\u201cQuibi will deliver premium video content for millennials on a technology platform that is built exclusively for mobile, so a telecommunications partner like T-Mobile, with their broad coverage today and impressive 5G road map, is the perfect fit,\u201d Quibi chief executive Meg Whitman said in a statement run by the LA Times.\n\n\u201cQuibi is leading the way on how video content is made and experienced in a mobile-first world,\u201d said Mike Sievert, president and chief operating officer of T-Mobile. \u201cThat\u2019s why our partnership makes perfect sense \u2014 two mobile-centric disrupters coming together to give customers something new and remarkable.\u201d\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThe companies confirmed the news to TechCrunch, following the L.A. Times report.", "description": "On the heels of getting the FCC\u2019s proposal to merge with Sprint, T-Mobile announced a plan to partner with Jeffrey Katzenberg\u2019s mobile streaming service, Quibi.
