Singh, minister for power and renewable energy, told parliament in July that India\u2019s capacity had crossed 80 gigawatts and was on track to reach 175 gigawatts in three years\u2019 time, as pledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHowever, private investment in the renewable sector remains low, and the government has found securing land for projects difficult.\n\nRenewable energy projects are not feasible in agricultural or forest lands, said Amit Bhandari of Mumbai-based think tank Gateway House.\n\n\u201cSince most of these western border areas are wastelands or semi-desert, they are perfect for setting up these projects,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile, investment in fossil fuel-based energy sources continues to rise in the South Asian nation, with both French energy giant Total and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco buying stakes in Indian companies.", "description": "Mumbai (AFP) \u2013 India plans to build a string of renewable energy projects along its sun-baked, wind-whipped western border, officials said Monday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/ab3b22_india-is-raising-its-investment-in-renewable-energy-breakneck-pace-india-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
