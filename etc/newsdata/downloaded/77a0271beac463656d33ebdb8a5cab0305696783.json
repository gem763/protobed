Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSEHK:1929 Historical Dividend Yield, October 28th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group paid out 76% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Paying out a majority of its earnings limits the amount that can be reinvested in the business. This may indicate a commitment to paying a dividend, or a dearth of investment opportunities.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group's cash payout ratio in the last year was 43%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the data, we can see that Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group has been paying a dividend for the past seven years. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past seven-year period, the first annual payment was HK$0.10 in 2012, compared to HK$0.70 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 32% per year over this time. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 32% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.\n\nSo, its dividends have grown at a rapid rate over this time, but payments have been cut in the past. The stock may still be worth considering as part of a diversified dividend portfolio.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share (EPS) are growing. Why take the risk of a dividend getting cut, unless there's a good chance of bigger dividends in future? In the last five years, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group's earnings per share have shrunk at approximately 8.8% per annum. If earnings continue to decline, the dividend may come under pressure. Every investor should make an assessment of whether the company is taking steps to stabilise the situation.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Limited (HKG:1929) from a dividend investor's...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pb9L4l0qeuDhXbp5WfA3gw--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/e1497a3278713414a3465631770afac8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
