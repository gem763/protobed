If he continues to peddle this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.\u2019\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFormer Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown in Kilmarnock, Scotland, today suggested he would stand for the Scottish Parliament if Alex Salmond continued 'lying' about the NHS\n\nMr Brown said he was prepared to return to frontline politics to fight the SNP in Holyrood, Edinburgh\n\nMr Brown, who has rarely been seen at Westminster since losing the 2010 election and resigning as Labour leader, has re-emerged to try to revive the faltering No campaign.\n\nHe even won praise from his old enemy David Cameron this week for \u2018catalysing\u2019 agreement on a rapid timetable for the devolution of more powers to the parliament in Holyrood.\n\nMr Brown will be 65 by the time of the next Scottish parliament elections in 2016. He has insisted he intends to stand in the General Election next year, but it is still possible to run in Holyrood elections while remaining an MP at Westminster.\n\nMr Brown\u2019s surprise threat came as he launched a bid to shore up support for the Union among Scottish pensioners.\n\nA Survation poll released last night showed the over 65s were overwhelmingly planning to vote \u2018No\u2019 \u2013 by 57 per cent to just 36 per cent in favour.\n\nMr Brown said Labour would not devolve Scottish pensions to Edinburgh \u2013 because they were safer under the protection of the UK Government.\n\nBut he said Mr Salmond\u2019s claim that the NHS was in danger from London were bogus because the health service was already controlled by Holyrood.\n\nMr Brown also vowed to hand further tax raising powers for the Scottish Government to increase funding for the health service.\n\nHe added that if Mr Salmond continued to claim that Labour was a threat to the NHS he would stand for office in Scotland.\n\nThe revelation that Mr Brown was prepared to move his political career to Edinburgh overshadowed his pitch to pensioners to vote against independence.\n\nMr Brown said: \u2018The nationalists want you to believe that if an English Prime Minister sought to privatise the NHS in Scotland or cut its budget, Scots would be powerless to prevent this from happening.\n\n\u2018They want you to believe that the Scottish Parliament is powerless to act to safeguard our NHS.\n\nIf Mr Brown returned to front-line politics in Holyrood it would mark a dramatic resurrection of his career after leaving Number 10 in 2010\n\n\u2018They want you to conclude that separation is the only answer if you care about the NHS. This is a nationalist deception \u2013 a claim that does not stand up to the evidence and that is not supported by the facts.\n\n\u2018What the nationalists don\u2019t tell you is that the Scottish health service cannot be privatised by Westminster because all decisions about our NHS are made here in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament, created by Labour in 1998, has full control over our health service.\n\n\u2018What the nationalists also don\u2019t tell you is that they are not powerless to fund the NHS. Under the Scotland Act 1998, they already had the power to raise an extra \u00a31,000 million in tax to help pay for the NHS in Scotland.\n\n\u2018Had they wanted to use it, the SNP could have raised the Scottish healthcare budget from \u00a312 billion to \u00a313 billion.\n\n\u2018The Scottish Parliament has all the powers it needs to fund the NHS in Scotland.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018It is time to nail the nationalist lie.\u2019\n\nHe said: \u2018Do you think that I or anyone else who cares about the NHS would let it be privatised in Scotland or have its funds cut \u2013 without a fight?\n\n\u2018Would we stand back and do nothing without ensuring that there were laws in place to guarantee that the NHS could not be privatised in Scotland or see its funding cut without our permission?\u2019\n\nHe also attacked Mr Salmond for rejecting the latest warnings that big businesses would move their headquarters to England in the event of a Yes vote next week.\n\nParaphrasing a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln, he said: \u2018I say to Alex Salmond: you can try to dismiss some of the warnings some of the time but you cannot dismiss all of the warnings all of the time.\u2019\n\nBut SNP leader Mr Salmond insisted Scotland was on the \u2018cusp of making history\u2019 by voting for independence in a week's time.\n\nVowing that Scots \u2018will vote Yes\u2019 in seven days' time, he attacked the No camp for being in \u2018terminal decline\u2019 the day after the leaders of three main UK parties travelled north of the border in a bid to save the union.\n\nMr Salmond said: \u2018Scotland is on the cusp of making history. The eyes of the world are upon Scotland. And what the world is seeing is an articulate, peaceful, energised debate.\n\n\u2018Scotland will vote Yes next Thursday and they will vote Yes because last minute, cobbled up promises from the No campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the Westminster Government.\n\n\u2018The No campaign is in terminal decline. In contrast a Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country.\u2019\n\nThe latest Survation poll for the Daily Record puts support for the union at 53 per cent and backing for independence on 47 per cent, when undecided voters are excluded.\n\nLast night an unprecedented list of 200 health workers \u2013 including porters, nurses, GPs and the country\u2019s top consultants \u2013 signed a letter warning that independence is a \u2018great risk\u2019 to the NHS.\n\nThe open letter to the Scottish Dail Mail stated: \u2018Patients from Scotland can access the care they need anywhere in the UK. Independence would, at best, put them at the back of the queue.\n\nThey accused the Yes campaign of peddling lies about the NHS.\n\n", "description": "The former PM said: \u2018If he continues to peddle this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.\u2019", "authors": ["Tom Mctague", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline", "James Chapman For The Daily Mail", "John Stevens For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/11/1410435343615_wps_5_Former_Labour_Prime_Minis.jpg", "published_at": "2014-09-11"}
