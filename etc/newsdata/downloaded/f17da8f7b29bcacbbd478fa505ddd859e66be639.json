The whistleblower complaint has since launched an investigation and spurred House Democrats to announce a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Napolitano, a frequent guest on the network, admitted there were a lot of attorneys who would disagree with his analysis during Smith's show. Smith characterized diGenova as a \"partisan guest\" and challenged his derogatory comments about Napolitano.\n\n\"Last night on this network, during primetime opinion programming, a partisan guest who supports President Trump was asked about Judge Napolitano's legal assessment, and when he was asked, he said, unchallenged, Judge Napolitano is a 'fool,'\" Smith said on his show.\n\n\"Attacking our colleague who's here to offer legal assessments on our air, in our work home, is repugnant,\" he added.\n\nSmith's previous reporting caught the attention of Trump, who likened the anchor to a competitor network and described him as Fox News's \"lowest rated anchor.\"\n\n\"Watching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith, the lowest rated show on @FoxNews,\" Trump said on Twitter on August 7.\n\nImmediately following Trump's tweet, Smith appeared to take his coverage and his differences with the president in stride.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. President,\" Smith said on his show after returning from a commercial break. \"It's nice to have you with us.\"\n\n\"We're being watched as you know,\" Smith said to his guest with a smile. \"A number of people. Some of them are not too happy. Which is too bad.\"\n\nFox News anchor Shepard Smith.

Bernie Sanders, and seven points behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 Trump told reporters he was \"not happy\" and claimed \"there's something going on at Fox.\"\n\nBret Baier, one of Smith's daytime colleagues and host of Fox News' \"Special Report,\" responded by emphasizing the difference between the network's objective reporting during the day, and its opinion-focused commentary during the evening.\n\n\"Fox has not changed,\" Baier said during his show on August 19. \"We have a news side and an opinion side. Opinion folks express their opinions. We do polls. Our latest poll had the Democratic candidates head to head, several of them ahead of President Trump.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, we've invited you on 'Special Report' many times,\" Baier added. \"We'd love to have you back on.\"\n\nFox News executives are clamping down on Smith for his coverage, according to a Vanity Fair report published Thursday. CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace directed anchor Smith, a longtime Fox News veteran, to limit covering President Donald Trump critically, according to a source who was informed of the talks, Vanity Fair reported.\n\n\"They said if he does it again, he's off the air,\" the person said.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson denied to Vanity Fair that a direct conversation between executives and Smith occurred.\n\nSmith, who has been with Fox News since 1996, previously signaled he was willing to break from his colleagues on the opinion side of the network if warranted.\n\n\"A lot of our audience is a right-wing audience,\" Smith said in 2017. \"They're a conservative audience. They're a traditional audience. But it's not as if they don't understand that sometimes the facts aren't on your side.\"\n\n\"There's an enormous audience out there that won't believe that,\" Smith added. \"Those in the far right and far left, because \u2013 so often, the facts fly in the face of your own worldview. Sometimes your side is wrong. And when they are, I'm here to give the facts. And I don't really care what you think.\"", "description": "\"We're being watched as you know,\" Fox News' Shepard Smith said to his guest with a smile. \"Some of them are not too happy.
