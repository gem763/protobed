REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The British public\u2019s expectations for the level of inflation over the next 12 months fell sharply in September, tracking a fall in the official measure of consumer price inflation last month, a monthly survey showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Citi/YouGov survey showed that on average people in September expected consumer prices to rise by 2.9% over the next 12 months, down from 3.2% in August, while expectations for the next five to 10 years fell to 3.0% from 3.1%.\n\n\u201cExpectations declined despite the spike in oil prices this month due to events in the Middle East.
