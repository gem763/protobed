This type of malware campaign, where hackers conceal malware codes in ordinary-looking files, is known as steganography.\n\nThe analysis showed that some of the WAV files contained code to deploy malware for financial gain and establish remote access within the victim machine. The report reads:\n\n\u201cWhen played, some of the WAV files produced music that had no discernible quality issues or glitches. Others simply generated static (white noise).\u201d\n\nThe malicious WAV files allow hackers to deploy CPU miners onto the victim\u2019s device, which steals processing resources and generates thousands of dollars per month from mining cryptocurrency. For that reason, crypto miners are a popular malware payload amongst hackers as they provide financial benefit while operating in the background without the user\u2019s knowledge \u2014 an attack commonly called crypto-jacking.\n\nNorth Korean hackers target Apple Macs\n\nCointelegraph previously reported that the notorious North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus APT Group have created another malware that targets Apple Macs and hides behind a fake cryptocurrency firm. Researchers said that at the time of their warning, the malware was undetected by any engines on VirusTotal. The sample appeared to be closely related to a strain of Mac malware identified by Kaspersky Labs back in summer 2018.", "description": "BlackBerry Cylance researchers discover malicious code in WAV audio files that hackers use to mine cryptocurrencies", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8zZWY5NjYzOTIzOWFhMzRjMjdiNjZlZTczZDgwZjQ5OC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
