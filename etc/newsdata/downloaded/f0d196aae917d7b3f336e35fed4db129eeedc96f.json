REUTERS/Luc Gnago/File Photo\n\nIn a statement, the International Organization for Migration said the workers - two men and one woman - were hit by crossfire during clashes between rival armed groups in the country\u2019s central Equatoria region.\n\nIt said the IOM had stopped screening for Ebola at five border points between South Sudan, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo, where an ongoing outbreak of the haemorraghic fever has killed thousands of people.\n\nThe dead woman\u2019s four-year-old son was abducted along with another local female IOM volunteer during the armed clash, the IOM said. Two other male volunteers were injured, including one who is recovering from a gunshot wound.\n\nHumanitarian workers are often targeted by rebels operating in South Sudan, which has been in the grip of war that first broke out in late 2013 between soldiers allied to President Salva Kiir and those of his former deputy Riek Machar. Last year, 10 aid workers went missing in Yei, in the same region.\n\n\u201cWe ...reiterate that humanitarians and civilians are not and should never be subjected to such heinous acts of violence \u2013 we are not a target,\u201d IOM Director General Ant\u00f3nio Vitorino said.\n\nIt was not clear who was behind the latest fighting.\n\nIn the past, government forces have clashed in the region with fighters from the rebel National Salvation Front, led by renegade former General Thomas Cirillo Swaka, who is not a party to a peace deal signed last year by Kiir and Machar.\n\nLul Ruai Koang, the government\u2019s military spokesman, said that on the day of the attack Cirillo\u2019s fighters had targeted a government position, and that one soldier was killed along with nine from Cirillo\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cIf they (National Salvation Front) went and killed the aid workers, this is what I do not know. But the attack on our defense positions didn\u2019t involve any humanitarian workers,\u201d Koang said.\n\nThe National Salvation Front was not immediately reachable to comment on the killings.", "description": "The U.N. migration agency has suspended some screening services for Ebola after three of its aid workers were killed in South Sudan, the latest deadly incident involving relief staff in the violence-ridden country.", "authors": ["Denis Dumo", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446533677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T13Z", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
