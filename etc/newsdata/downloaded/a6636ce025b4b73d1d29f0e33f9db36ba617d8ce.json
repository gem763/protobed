The audience seemed to delight in the letter, which says the schoolboy had adopted a 'disgracefully cavalier' attitude to his classical studies and 'sometimes seems affronted when criticised'", "description": "Former Tory leadership hopeful jokes with London audience that letter constitutes his resignation from Tory party", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d223808afca2597adfe3901aca8e21c7ffed4a0/30_38_1645_987/master/1645.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4830e67979dfe69309406d9049339181", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
