(AP) - Coloradans will soon be able to use digital IDs on their smartphones in their dealings with state agencies.\n\nGov. Jared Polis announced Wednesday that residents can create the ID by scanning their driver\u2019s license into an app called myColorado .\n\nThe app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\n\nColorado Politics reports the system goes into effect Dec. 1.\n\nPolis says it\u2019s more secure than carrying around plastic identification in an age where many are using digital wallets to pay for goods and services.\n\nHe says the ID may be used as driver\u2019s licenses next year. They can\u2019t be used - yet - for police purposes or at airport security screenings.\n\nSeveral U.S. states are considering or developing digital IDs, including Iowa, Idaho, Maryland and Wyoming.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Gazette, http://www.gazette.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coloradans will soon be able to use digital IDs on their smartphones in their dealings with state agencies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
