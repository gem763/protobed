But the newly discovered type is a 'novel defective' variant.\n\nThe type 2 EV-G can't possibly invade a host cell on its own because it doesn't have the same structures as other strains.\n\nViruses are unable to replicate without first making a viral particle to invade a living host cell.\n\nProfessor Mizutani and colleagues believe the strain is being aided by a 'helper virus', but at this stage it's impossible to know how.\n\nHe said: 'The recombinant virus we found has no structural proteins. This means the recombinant virus cannot make a viral particle.\n\n'We are wondering how this new virus came to be, how it infects cells or how it develops a viral particle.'\n\nProfessor Mizutani added: 'Our future work will be on solving this mystery of viral evolution.'\n\nSimilar amounts of type 1 and type 2 EV-G virus cells were found in the pig faeces, and it is possible the 'helper virus' is type 1.\n\nThe findings were first published in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, a publication printed by Elsevier.", "description": "Researchers at\u00a0Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) said we may be facing an 'new system of viral evolution'.
