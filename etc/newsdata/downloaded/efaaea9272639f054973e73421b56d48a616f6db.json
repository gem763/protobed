Jacky Ghossein\n\nThe protest votes against directors are not expected to seriously challenge the re-election of any directors - which would require more than a 50 per cent no vote.\n\nHowever, they could prove embarrassing for the likes of Tabcorp chairman Ms Dwyer, who faced a 27 per cent protest vote by ANZ shareholders last year.\n\nHarold Mitchell will also face questions at the Crown AGM. AAP\n\nMr Sampson continues to be questioned by investors as an outsider to the directors club.\n\nCrown directors John Poynton, Mr Mitchell and Ms Coonan will also be grilled about their independence, as the casino operator is expected to come under fire over it's alleged links to money laundering.\n\n\"She is chair of the audit committee and the company has paid its auditors non-audit fees, which are significantly in excess of audit fees over the last four years,\" ISS said, recommending against the former Liberal Senator and Howard government minister Ms Coonan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCGI Glass Lewis has also recommended against Ms Coonan over the non-audit fees to EY, creating the potential for a significant protest vote.\n\n\"Audit fees were $1,702,786 and non-audit fees (primarily for taxation and consulting) were $4,250,633, representing a 29 per cent-71 per cent split,\" CGI said.\n\n\"A vote against the re-election of Harold Mitchell is warranted because he is a non-independent non- executive director on a board that is not majority independent,\" ISS added about Mr Mitchell, who is also fighting ASIC over his time at Tennis Australia.\n\nThe Australian Shareholders Association also plans to vote against Crown director Mr Poynton, questioning a lack of gender diversity.\n\nTabcorp Carsales, JB Hi-Fi in sights\n\nTabcorp chairman Paula Dwyer faces a potential protest vote at the company's AGM on Thursday. Wayne Taylor\n\nISS recommends against the re-election of Tabcorp chairman Ms Dwyer, taking issue with her 14-year tenure, \"shared accountability for material failures\" at ANZ and strikes on pay last year at Tabcorp, ANZ and Healthscope, which she chaired until it was taken over in May.\n\nOther major proxy advisers are supporting her re-election, which is expected to blunt any protest vote on Thursday. Company insiders said it made sense for her to remain to oversee the merger with Tatts before she steps down in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nISS also takes issue with the approval of $3 million in performance rights to Tabcorp chief executive David Attenborough.\n\nRetail investors led by the ASA still remain undecided on Qantas director Mr Sampson but complain the advertising guru does not own enough airline shares.\n\n\"To demonstrate some alignment, directors should at a minimum have purchased shares equivalent to one year\u2019s pay within three years,\" the ASA said.\n\n\"In his three years Mr Sampson has only bought a mere 7,095 shares. We will hear from Mr Sampson when he intends to buy more shares to align with shareholders before we decide how we will vote our undirected proxies.\"\n\nBut with the major proxy firms and super funds supporting Mr Sampson and the ad man expected to commit to buying more shares, the complaint is unlikely to amount to much.\n\nCarsales faces a possible strike over pay on Friday as ISS, ASA and others raise concerns overits move to 40 per cent non-financial targets, which they claim are not clearly disclosed.\n\n\"This is going to be the big issue if APRA gets its way \u2013 it all goes into a black box,\" ISS Australia head Vas Kolesnikoff said.\n\nCGI has recommended against the grant of $1.7 million worth of equity to CEO Cameron McIntyre, but not against the remuneration report.\n\nCGI also questions related party transactions with Pentana for data and services worth over $1.5 million when Pentana shareholder and director Wal Pisciotta is also on the Carsales board.\n\nJB Hi-Fi CEO Richard Murray also faces a possible protest vote; both ISS and ASA recommended a no vote on pay after the retailer stuck with its combined pay plan, which was rejected by more than 21 per cent of investors last year.\n\nMs Dwyer, Ms Coonan, Mr Mitchell and Mr Sampson all declined to comment.", "description": "Tabcorp's Paula Dwyer, Crown's Helen Coonan and Harold Mitchell, and Qantas' Todd Sampson face personal protest votes as part of the recent trend of targeting individual directors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2413%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_166%2C$y_5/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/279e706e0e6500917ac17f24865d223a8996d950", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
