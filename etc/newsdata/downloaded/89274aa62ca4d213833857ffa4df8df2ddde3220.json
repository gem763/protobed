Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that Warren\u2019s diagnosis of the issue was \u201cone-hundred percent\u201d correct, but that \u201ccompetition doesn\u2019t solve all of the problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason no one is using Bing today\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason no one is using Bing today,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cUsing a 20th century antitrust framework will not work.\u201d\n\nWarren, of course, backed her own plan, arguing that \u201ca handful of monopolists\u201d shouldn\u2019t \u201cdominate our economy and our democracy.\u201d Other candidates, like Cory Booker agreed that corporate consolidation is a major threat to the American economy, but stopped short of singling out any specific tech companies. If elected president, Booker said that he would appoint officials who would rigorously enforce current US antitrust laws, but didn\u2019t acknowledge any changes that should be made to them.\n\nBernie Sanders didn\u2019t have a chance to respond to the question, but he announced a sweeping new policy plan this week to reshape corporate America that included a reversal of the consumer welfare standard. That standard, which has become commonplace in antitrust law, generally is used as justification for officials to approve mergers if it means that prices would go down as a result. But when it comes to tech companies, most of their services are offered for free. You don\u2019t pay to post a photo on Instagram or message a friend on Facebook.\n\nModerators asked California Senator Kamala Harris if breaking up tech companies would make it more difficult for them to fight disinformation and build broader coalitions to counter election interference. In response, she pivoted to Twitter and the platform\u2019s unwillingness to ban President Donald Trump, calling his tweets and rhetoric dangerous.\n\n\u201dTwitter should be held accountable and shut down\u201d Trump\u2019s Twitter account, Harris said.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke suggested that it was a bad idea to target specific companies, but said that his administration would be \u201cunafraid to break up big businesses.\u201d He also floated his plan to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that would incentivize social media platforms to remove terrorist content, something he proposed shortly after his hometown of El Paso, Texas faced a major shooting earlier this year.\n\nLargely, candidates held the same positions they had on breaking up big tech that they did earlier this year when Warren first posed the question.
