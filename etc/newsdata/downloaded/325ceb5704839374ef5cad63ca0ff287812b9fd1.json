But I doubt it,\" said the coach, who has been with Notre Dame for more than 30 years.\n\nMcGraw, speaking ahead of a Women's Sports Foundation event in New York, went viral on social media in April, when she made a fierce plea for gender equality in sports, politics, business and beyond, during an NCAA Final Four news conference.\n\nThe two-time women's college basketball champion coach said that marketing opportunities were still scarce for female athletes, even at the professional level.\n\n\"When you look across the country right now (in) sports marketing, really, what athletes are you seeing on national TV? Just very, very few, even on the men\u2019s side. And there are virtually no women,\" said McGraw.\n\n\"Serena's probably the one that can garner that kind of attention,\" she said of tennis superstar Serena Williams.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a long way to go with just the professional athletes.\"\n\n(Reporting By Amy Tennery; Editing by Bill Berkrot)", "description": "(Reuters) - Notre Dame women's basketball coach Muffet McGraw expressed scepticism on Wednesday over a California law permitting college athletes be paid, saying she was concerned that the legislation would not do much to help women athletes.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
