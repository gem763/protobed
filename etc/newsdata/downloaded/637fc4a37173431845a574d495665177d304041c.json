They are required by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas. They are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance, and obstruction,\" they wrote.\n\nDowd had said earlier this week that neither Parnas nor Fruman planned to comply with an earlier request from the committees for documents and depositions that would have been scheduled for this week.\n\nDowd, in an Oct. 3 letter released by the committees, confirmed that Parnas and Fruman \"assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump\" and had been represented by Giuliani \"in connection with their personal and business affairs.\"\n\nBut Dowd argued that the committees had not offered sufficient time for his clients to prepare documents and testimony.\n\n\n\nThe committees said that Dowd, on behalf of Parnas and Fruman, sent an email on Wednesday saying they \"agree with and adopt the position of the White House counsel\" refusing to cooperate with Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nThe subpoena demands that Parnas and Fruman hand over documents and communications related to efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate matters related to the Biden family, the Democratic National Committee or Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrey Gowdy joins Trump's legal team Support for impeachment reaches highest level in Fox News poll Trey Gowdy out at Fox News amid talks to join Trump defense team MORE.\n\n\n\nAccording to reports, Parnas and Fruman introduced Giuliani to current and former Ukrainian officials who provided information that Giuliani claimed would be damaging to Trump's political opponents.\n\n\n\nParnas and Fruman have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to GOP candidates and committees, according to the Miami Herald. In May 2018, they gave $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, through an LLC called Global Energy Producers.\n\n\n\nThe subpoena issued Thursday also demands that Parnas and Fruman provide documents related to contributions or \"offers of anything of value\" made directly or indirectly to U.S. political campaigns, parties and political action committees, including America First Action.\n\n\n\nParnas and Fruman were charged on Thursday with four counts, including conspiracy, falsification of records and providing false information to the Federal Election Commission. An indictment alleges that the two men funneled foreign money into U.S. elections through a straw donor scheme.\n\n\n\nParnas accompanied Giuliani to a July breakfast with Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerDemocrats request testimony from Trump's former Russia adviser Democrats plow ahead as Trump seeks to hobble impeachment effort Graham threatens to call Volker to testify if Democrats don't release testimony MORE, the former envoy to Ukraine. Volker, in written testimony to House investigators last week, said they \"had a long conversation about Ukraine.\" Giuliani, according to Volker, said he wanted Ukraine to investigate Biden and 2016 election interference.\n\n\n\nThe indictment further alleges Fruman and Parnas asked a U.S. congressman in 2018 to help call for firing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The Trump administration eventually recalled that ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, in May.\n\n\n\nFormer Rep.

Parnas and Fruman later donated to Sessions's campaign.\n\n\n\nSessions told The Wall Street Journal that his letter came from a concern among lawmakers that the Trump administration needed to move faster in appointing new ambassadors.\n\n\n\nThe indictment does not name Sessions nor charge him with a crime, but Sessions has previously acknowledged meeting with Parnas and Fruman.\n\n\n\nThe subpoenas issued by the committees on Thursday also ask for documents and communications related to Sessions, \"including but not limited to a meeting in or about May 2018.\"\n\nUpdated at 1:20 p.m.", "description": "House Democrats on Thursday issued subpoenas to two Florida businessmen who worked with President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on his efforts to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/giulianirudy_05302018getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
