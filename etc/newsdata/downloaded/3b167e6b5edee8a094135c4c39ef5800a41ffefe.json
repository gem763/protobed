Here are the Gigantamax versions of Pikachu, Eevee, Charizard, and Meowth. Gigantamaxing bumps up their battle stats, increases their size and changing their appearance, making them all strange, big, and glowy.\n\nThat version of Meowth sure is something! It looks like a nod to the long-cat meme, but glowing and with yellow eyes. But wow, there\u2019s also a chonky Pikachu that apparently has enough electricity to charge a power plant, a Charizard with magma hot wings that can\u2019t be safe, and and giant Eevee with a cuddle attack that does not damage but causes pok\u00e9mon of the other gender to become infatuated with it. That\u2019s cute!\n\nPreviously, we saw the Gigantamax forms of Alcremie, Corviknight, and Drednaw. The long form of Meowth is a \u201cearly purchase\u201d bonus for Sword and Shield that players can get by using the Get via Internet option in Mystery Gift from November 15 to January 15. So technically it\u2019s limited time only. Get in on the meme or regret it for the rest of your life, I guess.", "description": "It\u2019s official.
