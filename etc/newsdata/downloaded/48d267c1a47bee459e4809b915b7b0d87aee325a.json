As always, we'll be fact-checking the 12 contenders in real time.\n\nSee all the claims and the facts below, and check back for more updates as debate continues.

Beto O'Rourke said that President Donald Trump asked China to involve itself in the 2020 election \"in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.\"\n\nWhile the president surely called on China to probe possible political rival Joe Biden's family amid ongoing trade talks \u2014 he did so on television this month \u2014 he hasn't publicly hinged it on \"favorable\" trade terms. We have not seen a record of Trump's conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but the president has denied asking Beijing to probe the Bidens.\n\nAsked explicitly if he'd be \"more willing to do a trade deal with the Chinese\" if they investigated his political rival, the president said, \"No, it has nothing to do with it. No. No. I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it's good for our country.\"\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro claims Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania have lost jobs. Is that true?\n\nEarly on Tuesday night, former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said that, \"Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, actually, in the latest jobs data, have lost jobs, not gained them.\"\n\nThis doesn't appear to be true, at least when it comes to Michigan and Pennsylvania. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment \u2014 both the rate and the total number of persons who are unemployed \u2014 went down in Michigan from July 2019 to August 2019, the latest month for which state data is available.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the unemployment rate remained the same from July 2019 to August 2019. The number of people who were unemployed increased from July 2019 to August 2019, but so did the number of people who were employed.\n\nCastro is right about Ohio, however, where both the unemployment rate and the number of persons unemployed increased from July 2019 to August 2019.", "description": "Three hours, 12 candidates.
