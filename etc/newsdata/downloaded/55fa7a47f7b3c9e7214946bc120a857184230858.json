Atopic dermatitis is a serious, chronic form of eczema associated with a high burden of disease linked to itch, sleep deprivation and significant quality of life impairment.\n\n\u201cWe are advancing the development of nemolizumab as planned. The Phase 2 results showed clear clinical benefits, adding to the growing scientific evidence that the IL-31 pathway may be an important driver in atopic dermatitis. We are committed to continuing our work to bring new therapies to patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,\u201d said Thibaud Portal PhD, Galderma Global Vice President, Prescription medicines.\n\nEarlier this year, Galderma presented the final results from the Phase 2b study of nemolizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis at the 2019 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting late-breaking session and published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in August 20191\n\nAbout the IL-31 Pathway and Atopic Dermatitis\n\nModerate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), a serious, chronic form of eczema, is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by an allergic response driven by a subset of immune cells called Type 2 helper T cells, or Th2 cells. IL-31, a cytokine released by Th2 cells, is involved in AD associated pruritus by interacting with IL-31 receptor alpha expressed by neuron. IL-31 is also thought to play a role in AD skin inflammation and AD skin barrier impairment. Moderate-to-severe forms of AD can be characterized by pronounced cutaneous dryness, and skin lesions marked by redness, infiltration/papulation, crusting/oozing, and lichenification, with periods of lesion exacerbation accompanied by intense itching, scratching, and skin damage that can lead to secondary infections. Moderate-to-severe AD can negatively impact patients\u2019 lives and is associated with a high burden to patients particularly with itching, sleep deprivation and depression.\n\nAbout Nemolizumab\n\nNemolizumab, a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody, is directed against the IL-31R alpha, which blocks signaling from \u2013 IL-31. Nemolizumab, initially developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., was subsequently licensed to Galderma in 2016. Nemolizumab is an investigational agent under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nAbout Galderma\n\nGalderma, the world\u2019s largest independent global dermatology company, was created in 1981 and is now present in over 100 countries with an extensive product portfolio to treat a range of dermatological conditions. The company partners with health care practitioners around the world to meet the skin health needs of people throughout their lifetime. Galderma is a leader in research and development of scientifically-defined and medically-proven solutions for the skin. For more information, please visit www.galderma.com\n\nReferences\n\n1.
