This allows savers to contribute to their pension and benefit from tax relief, but if they need early access to some of their savings, they are given this without penalty. This should be extended to Sipps, to allow the self-employed more flexible saving behaviour. 3) The Government should match contributions made by self-employed individuals to their pension to account for the contributions they 'lose' by not being employed and eligible for auto-enrolment.\n\nLife Strategy funds cost 0.22 per cent a year and MyMap funds cost 0.17 per cent a year.\n\nThese investment charges are rolled into Penfold's 'basic plan' costing 0.80 per cent if you use a Vanguard fund, or 'advanced plan' costing 0.75 per cent if you use a BlackRock one.\n\nWhile it may seem strange that the basic plan is more expensive than the advanced one, this reflects the fees on the underlying funds and BlackRock's range being more complex.\n\nPenfold does not charge exit fees to move your pension, but it might charge up to \u00a350 per incoming old pot if it is a small one.\n\nAfter retirement it will charge \u00a3125 for flexible withdrawfuls; \u00a3125 per payment if you are making withdrawals that include a 25 per cent tax-free lump each time - known in financial jargon as 'UFPLS', and explained here - and \u00a375 if you turn your fund into an annuity.\n\nPenfold says its advantage is that it is the 'only pension built specifically for freelancers & contractors'.\n\nHowever, It can potentially be slightly more expensive than opening a Sipp and investing in the same funds through a DIY investing platform.\n\nThe largest, Hargreaves Lansdown, charges 0.45 per cent per year as an admin fee on Sipps, which when added to the Vanguard LifeStrategy or BlackRock MyMap fund fees delivers a total cost of 0.67 per cent or 0.62 per cent, respectively.\n\nAJ Bell charges 0.25 per cent annually, which with fund fees added is a total cost of 0.47 per cent, or 0.42 per cent, respectively, but does add dealing charges of \u00a31.50.\n\nOther platforms, such as Interactive Investor charge flat monthly rather than percentage fees, which can be cheaper on larger pension pots.\n\n> Read our round-up of the best and cheapest Sipps\n\nThe benefits of pension saving for the self-employed\n\nEmployed people who are auto-enrolled into pensions get free top-ups from their employers and government tax relief, in addition to their own contributions.\n\nAltogether that tots up to 8 per cent of their qualifying earnings, currently between \u00a36,136 and \u00a350,000, a year.\n\nSelf-employed people receive government tax relief, which is a rebate you get on pension contributions based on your income tax rate of 20 per cent, 40 per cent or 45 per cent. It effectively makes saving into a pension tax free.\n\nPenfold says that that if you're a basic rate 20 per cent taxpayer it will add this government rebate straight into your pension, but if you\u2019re a higher rate taxpayer you have to get it by filling in a tax return.\n\nThe firm says the features it has designed for the self-employed include making it easy to pause and change contribution levels, and allowing people to pay in from either their personal account or business account.\n\nEmployed people can use Penfold's service, but would miss out on free employer top-ups.\n\nPenfold's three bosses, who set up the firm in 2018, have backgrounds in finance and technology and hope to make pensions as accessible as banking, which has been revolutionalised by apps like Monzo.\n\nCo-founder Peter Hykin says: 'We know that auto-enrolment has increased participation in pensions to 80 per cent amongst the employed, but this hasn\u2019t helped the millions of UK self-employed.\n\n'It\u2019s almost like the self-employed, who we know are the backbone of the economy, are being ignored by the government and UK industry. There is absolutely no pensions option out there which adequately serves those working for themselves.\n\n'We\u2019re aiming to make pensions not just easier, but more attractive for self-employed people to start planning for later in life.\n\n'Often people put off setting up a pension due to the amount of understanding needed, the volume of paperwork and even just the fact that it can involve calling multiple providers to find the best option.'", "description": "Penfold says the country's five million self-employed people are 'underserved' by existing pension options, with just 14 per cent saving for old age.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
