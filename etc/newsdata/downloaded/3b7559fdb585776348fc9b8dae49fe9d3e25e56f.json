You know, whether they were assassins or whether they were lawyers or detectives, I think I've had the ability to really fall into that category more.\u201d\n\nKRISTEN STEWART TALKS TRAINING FOR 'CHARLIE'S ANGELS' REBOOT: 'I REALLY HATED IT'\n\nAnd for good reason.\n\nThe 50-year-old actress, who stars in the CBS All Access comedy-drama series \u201cWhy Women Kill,\u201d said she enjoyed playing this latest part due to the fact that she simply hadn\u2019t been able to commit any crimes in her seven seasons as Dr. Joan Watson on the long-running Sherlock Holmes-Meets-Manhattan series \u201cElementary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm so excited to commit a crime, I can't tell you,\" she said. \"I think it's about time. I'm surprised Joan Watson didn't go crazy and commit a crime before the end of Season 7.\u201d\n\nIn playing her character, Simone Grove -- a socialite in the 1980s who is entrenched in dealing with infidelity in her marriage -- Liu said Grove\u2019s arc in Season 1 of the streaming-only series is an evolution of who she is.\n\nLUCY LIU TO BE SECOND ASIAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO RECEIVE WALK OF FAME STAR\n\n\u201cShe has a bit of an affectation and she is also \u2013 I mean, I think her whole life is a bit of an affectation and I think it's the lavish d\u00e9cor and the way that she presents herself to society is sort out a facade for where she came from originally. And we sort of find that out as the episodes go on,\u201d said Liu.\n\nLiu also addressed the forthcoming \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d reboot film. (Liu starred in the original movie, alongside Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore, nearly 20 years ago.)\n\nLiu said she hasn\u2019t had any interaction with stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska as they become the new trio.\n\n\u201cI haven't, actually. I mean, I was on my show and then I hadn't even found out about it and someone asked me about it and I was like, I think that's great,\u201d Liu explained. \u201cI don't know what they're expecting, like a catfight. It's so silly.\n\n'CHARLIE'S ANGELS' TRAILER DEBUTS SHOWING THE NEW LADIES IN SOME EXPLOSIVE ACTION\n\n\u201cBack then, it was sort of like such a strange thing especially given the time right now. But I think it's wonderful. I think there's a reason why there are many iterations of that show that we made into a movie, that then became a show that then became a movie. You know, there's a reason why people are attracted to it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the industry\u2019s shift toward inclusion and diverse content, the Emmy-nominated actress said it is long overdue and hopes the trend continues to push the entertainment business to offer opportunities to minorities including, of course, Asians and Asian-Americans.\n\n\u201cI think that there is more opportunity for diversity and I think that it's becoming more colorblind,\" Liu said. \"So I don't know that it's specifically because it's Asian. I mean some of the projects obviously are but I think that there's a different level of expectation from the audience. And I think because, as I said, there's so much content -- there is the ability for networks or streaming services to really understand that there is a need and a desire for that and that there's an opportunity for them especially if they have such a viewership and audience.\u201d\n\n\u2018CHARLIE\u2019S ANGELS\u2019 STAR CHERYL LADD ON HER RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD: 'IT HAS GOTTEN STRONGER AND DEEPER'\n\n\u201cIt allows for that, you know, whether it's 'Always Be My Maybe' or whatever it is \u2013 it's sort of great that they are giving [opportunities],\u201d she added. \u201cAnd then they also started to understand the numbers and the idea of Nielsen is not as current as it used to be, so I think they're looking at other things and they have nothing to lose by putting that on the air.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d franchise voice actress said these opportunities can be life-changing and added that the shift can certainly be seen and felt but noted that there is still much progress to be made.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cIt only helps them and it makes them create a much more diverse panel for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that is now being seen as a much more important part of the entertainment business, whether it's directing or people behind the scenes or people in the crew. It's not just about having one solid thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo a lot of people who were not given the opportunities before are now being given those opportunities or are asked to come on board because they wanted that or they need that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Women Kill\u201d is currently streaming on CBS All Access.", "description": "The A-list star's characters have been strong women and that\u2019s something she doesn\u2019t take for granted.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Lucy-Liu-WWK.jpg"}
