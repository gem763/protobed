REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nEurope ministers, making a third attempt since June 2018 to approve membership talks for the Balkan hopefuls, discussed in Luxembourg opening a path for Skopje and Tirana, with broad EU support and backing from the United States.\n\nBut just as those discussions were getting underway, a French presidency official in Paris said Macron\u2019s government would not agree to open talks now, even if Paris did support eventual membership for North Macedonia and Albania.\n\n\u201cThese countries will be part of the European Union one day...but it is too early to open the legal process towards enlargement,\u201d the presidential official said, referring to the term for admitting new members.\n\nIn Luxembourg, Amelie de Montchalin, France\u2019s European affairs minister, was blunt, saying there could be no way forward before a reform in how and when candidates for membership are vetted on EU targets, which range from economic policy to human rights and the rule of law.\n\nFrance says the EU faces too many challenges - including Britain\u2019s planned exit; China, seen as a \u201cstrategic rival\u201d; security threats posed by Russia; and migration - to let in two more states from the Balkans, a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\nBut the French stance has raised concerns in Brussels about further delays in an already protracted process that could backfire by spurring Balkan states to cultivate closer ties with Russia and China.\n\nThe six Balkan countries of Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, all of which apart from Albania emerged from the 1990s disintegration of Yugoslavia, are considered future EU members.\n\n\u201cThe first thing we need to talk about is how Europe must reform the way it does enlargement and negotiations,\u201d de Montchalin said, calling the process \u201can endless soap opera\u201d.\n\n\u201cIs the process efficient? From our point of view, no.\u201d\n\nUnless an agreement is clinched in Luxembourg, ministers will leave a decision on Albanian and North Macedonian membership talks to EU government leaders, who will hold a two-day summit from Thursday.\n\nDEEPLY FRUSTRATED\n\nWhile the Netherlands supports French wariness of membership talks for Albania, which is already a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, many other countries, led by Italy, are deeply frustrated by the French position.\n\nGermany has proposed a compromise by starting EU membership talks with North Macedonia before the end of this year and agreeing in principle to launch the process for Albania, but without setting a date before Tirana meets more conditions.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU executive that handles EU accession talks, said it was wrong to add more conditions because North Macedonia and Albania had met targets set by the EU governments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to provide a proper explanation (for the delay),\u201d European Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who oversees EU membership bids, told Reuters. \u201cIf we agreed with our partners on steps to take and our partners are delivering, it is then our time to deliver.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage France says too early to hold talks with Balkans on EU membership\n\nHahn pointed to Albanian reforms to root out bribery among judges, which many in the EU say are the most significant assault on judicial graft since the country of three million people emerged from communist isolation in the early 1990s.\n\nNorth Macedonia, meanwhile, has resolved a long dispute with Greece over the country\u2019s name - changing from Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia - and has cleared the way for NATO membership, probably in December.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to give a political signal that enlargement is not dead,\u201d said George Ciamba, Romania\u2019s EU minister.", "description": "France stuck to its hard line against European Union membership talks for North Macedonia and Albania on Tuesday, setting up a showdown between French President Emmanuel Macron and fellow EU leaders later this week in Brussels.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441091068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0Z0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
