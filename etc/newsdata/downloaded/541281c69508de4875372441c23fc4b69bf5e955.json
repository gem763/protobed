Now, in an updated post published on Aug. 17, Young has confirmed that the album, titled Colorado, will be out this October. Its first single, \"Rainbow of Colors\" will be released this month.\n\nOn April 14, Young revealed to fans that he and Crazy Horse were going to begin recording that week. Then, two weeks after that post, Young returned with another new update titled \"Crazy Horse Playback!: High in the Rockies.\" In the post, Young shared that they had completed \"11 new songs, ranging from three minutes to 14 minutes of music each.\" (In the August update, Young clarified that the album will now include \"10 new songs ranging from around three minutes to over 13 minutes.\")\n\nYoung praised Colorado as \"one of the most diverse albums I have ever made and I can't wait for you to hear it.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated new album was recorded in the Rocky Mountains and captured at \"24/192 high resolution,\" an audio quality that they later tested out by playing on Young's very own PonoPlayer device.\n\nYoung first reunited with Crazy Horse last year for a number of theatre shows. The current lineup of Crazy Horse includes members Nils Lofgren, Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot. Frank \"Poncho\" Sampedro, a member of Crazy Horse who had been with the band for 43 years, was not involved in this new Young project.\n\nIn addition to this album, Young also recently announced that he was putting his 2019 tour plans on hold to focus on 15 new film projects.", "description": "The Canadian icon calls upcoming record 'one of the most diverse albums I have ever made.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5118166.1556720994!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/neil-young.jpg"}
