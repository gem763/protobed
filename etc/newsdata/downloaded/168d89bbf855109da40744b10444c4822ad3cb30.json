Overall, 68 municipalities in nine states have been affected by the spill that began on Sept. 2.\n\nA report from Brazil's Institute of the Environment and Water Resources said the origin of the sludge has still not been determined, though environment minister Ricardo Salles earlier said the oil was likely of Venezuelan origin - something denied by Caracas. The main hypothesis is that the oil spilled from a vessel passing near the Brazilian coast.\n\nAfter studying the ships that passed through the region, Brazil's Navy on Thursday began asking 30 oil tankers from 10 different countries for clarifications of their actions.\n\nThe environmental institute said 12 sea turtles and a bird have died after coming in contact with the crude oil.\n\nBrazil's environmental protection agency has said it fears the oil spotted could just be a small fraction of what was spilled, noting there are some 2,000 kilometers (about 1,242 miles) of coastal line to monitor. The oil has been particularly hard to track as it floats under the surface of the water and can't be easily detected from planes.\n\nIn this Sept. 25, 2019 photo released by the Sergipe state Government, an oil spill covers a beach on Sergipe state, Brazil.
