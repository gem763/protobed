Four parents reversed their not-guilty pleas Monday and avoided indictment on the bribery count.\n\nA grand jury also returned an indictment on Tuesday charging five university employees, a public school teacher and a former employee of Singer\u2019s with fraud conspiracy, in addition to the racketeering conspiracy charge they already faced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur goal from the beginning has been to hold the defendants fully accountable for corrupting the college admissions process through cheating, bribery and fraud,\u201d said Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney in Boston, whose office is prosecuting the cases. \u201cThe superseding indictments will further that effort.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for a parent and two coaches indicted on Tuesday criticized Lelling\u2019s prosecutors as overzealous and said they were twisting federal law in an attempt to make legal behavior appear criminal.\n\n\u201cThe zeal with which this U.S. attorney\u2019s office strives to have long prison sentences hanging over these individuals\u2019 heads is staggering,\u201d said Nina Marino, who represents Donna Heinel, a former USC administrator accused of pocketing bribes and, in exchange, steering unqualified applicants into the school. Heinel was indicted Tuesday on new charges of conspiring to commit fraud and bribery.\n\nMartin G. Weinberg, who represents Robert Zangrillo, a Miami businessman charged with conspiring to bribe his daughter\u2019s way into USC, called the new bribery charge \u201can unprecedented attempt to criminalize a donation made to a university by a parent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNever before have donations to a university \u2014 whether to an athletic department or to any other part of a school \u2014 been characterized as a bribe or alleged as a federal crime,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cMr Zangrillo\u2019s daughter was not even presented to or admitted by USC admissions as an athlete. He vigorously denies each and every allegation in today\u2019s charges.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Jovan Vavic, USC\u2019s former water polo coach, said his client was no more guilty of the new fraud charge than the earlier racketeering one, to which he pleaded not guilty. The government\u2019s filing of a new indictment was \u201cimplicit acknowledgment\u201d that their earlier charges were flawed, said Vavic\u2019s attorney, Stephen Larson.\n\n\u201cMr. Vavic did not violate any federal laws,\u201d Larson said, \u201cand at all times did exactly what was expected of and demanded of him as the head coach of USC\u2019s highly accomplished water polo program.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for other parents and coaches charged on Tuesday had no comment or didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nTuesday\u2019s indictments introduced few alleged criminal acts that weren\u2019t laid out in earlier charging documents. Instead, prosecutors argued that the same allegations \u2014 parents conspiring with Singer to fix their children\u2019s standardized tests and pass them off as athletic recruits for sports they didn\u2019t play competitively or at all \u2014 amounted to a bribery conspiracy as well.\n\nThe federal program bribery charge can be lodged against anyone accused of bribing an employee or agent of an organization that receives $10,000 or more in funding from the federal government, and who obtains something valued at $5,000 or more in exchange. Prosecutors argue that the parents charged conspired with Singer to bribe coaches into giving up admissions slots, which are property of the universities that employ them.\n\nVirtually every university, public or private, receives more than the $10,000 in federal funding needed to trigger the bribery statute in research grants or financial aid. Prosecutors will likely say that admission to the elite schools to which Singer peddled access \u2014 Stanford, Georgetown, USC and UCLA, among others \u2014 exceeded $5,000 in value.\n\nWhile the indictments don\u2019t allege new criminal acts, they do contain details of Singer\u2019s interactions with parents that weren\u2019t previously known. In the case of Loughlin and Giannulli, the indictment says, the fashion designer emailed his accountant in April 2017 to explain a $200,000 invoice he\u2019d received from Singer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple paid $250,000 in all to misrepresent their older daughter as a recruited coxswain and bribe Heinel, the athletics official, to slip her into the school, prosecutors allege.\n\n\u201cGood news my daughter ... is in [U]SC,\u201d Giannulli wrote to his accountant, according to the indictment. \u201cBad is I had to work the system.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Heinel, two university employees indicted on Tuesday \u2014 Jorge Salcedo, the former UCLA men\u2019s soccer coach, and Gordon Ernst, the former tennis coach at Georgetown \u2014 were also charged with committing federal program bribery.\n\nAll 11 of the parents indicted on bribery charges are accused of conspiring to bribe employees of USC, underscoring Singer\u2019s reach at the private university that in recent years has seen its national profile surge and its acceptance rate plummet. The Times previously reported that the university flagged 33 students as having ties to Singer. Nineteen parents, three coaches and an administrator have been implicated in Singer\u2019s scheme and charged by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Boston. USC said on Monday that Loughlin and Giannulli\u2019s two daughters were no longer enrolled at the school.\n\nFour parents who were indicted on Tuesday \u2014 John Wilson, William McGlashan Jr., Joey Chen and Robert Zangrillo \u2014 were also charged with aiding and abetting wire fraud. Wilson was charged with an additional two counts of aiding and abetting federal program bribery, which prosecutors said he committed while scheming with Singer to have his children admitted under fraudulent pretenses to USC, Stanford and Harvard. His attorney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf convicted of the federal bribery charge, along with the fraud and money laundering counts lodged against them earlier, parents would likely go into their sentencing hearings with a higher guideline range than those who reversed their pleas and avoided indictment on charges of bribery. Federal judges consult the guidelines when determining a sentence.\n\nBut the guidelines are only advisory; even if a parent were convicted of three charges instead of two, experts say, a judge could decide the facts of the case remained the same and not take the third charge into account when deciding a sentence.", "description": "Eleven parents, including Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli, now face an added bribery charge in the college admissions case.", "authors": ["Matthew Ormseth Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times.
