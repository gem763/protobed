He was eventually arrested after a three-hour stand-off with police.\n\nMiss Rechelle, from Glossop in Derbyshire, was treated for her wounds and later agreed to give evidence against Booth fearing he would harm other women he came into contact with.\n\nShe told Manchester Crown Court: 'It was always like walking on egg shells with him - he is just not a nice person and he used to make me feel really on edge all the time.\n\n'I lost loads of weight. I wasn't eating or sleeping. He was horrible to me. I felt frightened as I knew when he was going to switch.\n\n'He never gave me time to think on my own and to be on my own. He would say he was never going to hurt me - but he did.'\n\nJudge Richard Mansell QC praised Miss Rechelle as Booth, also of Glossop, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, assault by beating, escaping custody and possession of a bladed article following the stabbing last February 2.\n\nHis not guilty plea to attempted murder was accepted.\n\nThe judge told her: 'You have been brave in the extreme. You have not just protected yourself you have protected other women.'\n\nBut when she called time on their 20-month on-off romance, Booth broke into her home at 1am before dragging her into the street by her hair and stabbing her in the stomach and legs in front of police\n\nThe pair had begun dating in June 2017 but their relationship began to sour in the summer of 2018.\n\nProsecuting Neil Fryman said: 'She tried splitting from him on a number of occasions but there was a barrage of texts, he turned up at her place of work and she thought it was easier being with him then not.\n\n'There were numerous incidents of domestic violence and abuse. There was one occasion when he had pushed her face down into the carpet and put his foot on the top of her head so she couldn't breathe. He then stopped and said he was sorry.'\n\nMiss Rechelle reported one abusive incident to police but later retracted her statement because she was scared social services could take away her son.\n\n'Controlling' booth would repeatedly attack her and then pretend to be sorry as a way of getting her back.\n\nOn February 2, Booth followed Miss Rechelle when she was on a night out and turned up at a pub where she was enjoying drinks with colleagues.\n\nMr Fryman described how she got home at 12.30am to be awoken by her dog barking as Booth banged on the front door saying, 'I'm sorry, I love you'.\n\nShe told him to go away or she would call the police but he started getting angrier and kicked the door before breaking in by smashing a window.\n\nThe prosecutor continued: 'He pinned her down on the carpet in the lounge, released her to the floor by the throat, he punched her over and over to the face.\n\n'She didn't know what made him get off her but he did, she tried to put her arms round him to calm him down in a cuddling motion, the force of the punches was '10 out of 10'.\n\n'He got up and went to the kitchen, she took her opportunity to escape she fled out of the front door shouting for help she had no shoes on.'\n\nMiss Rechelle looked around to see Booth running after her with a kitchen knife\n\nMiss Rechelle, from Glossop in Derbyshire, was treated for her wounds and later agreed to give evidence against Booth fearing he would harm other women he came into contact with\n\nMr Fryman added: 'She kept running and remembers waking up on the floor with lots of police around.\n\n'She remembers he was on top of her outside and she was trying to cover her face. She did see him with the same knife in his hand and this time there was blood on the handle, blade and on his face.\n\n'The defendant was seen holding her by the hair holding the knife up and then stabbing the victim as the police were there. He then blamed the police saying it was all the police's fault.\n\nThe judge praised the beauty therapist's bravery in court\n\n'Officers saw Zahra being stabbed three times to her stomach area, she was dragged into the middle of the road by her hair.\n\n'The officer saw the knife which the defendant was holding at her throat and then at her chest.'\n\nMiss Rechelle sustained wounds to her left lower chest, right thigh, left thigh and outer right lower leg.\n\nShe had stitches to her mouth, hand, stomach and to three different areas of her leg and will be scarred for life.\n\nThe therapist also suffered cuts to her lip and a fracture to the right eye socket.\n\nBooth has a string of other offences for violence including ABH, battery and attempted robbery.\n\nHe had previously attacked on another ex-girlfriend at a house party during which he kicked and punched her before ripping out her hair extensions.\n\nHis counsel, Sara Haq, said in mitigation: 'He fully acknowledges his appalling behaviour on the night of this incident and acknowledges nothing can ever explain or justify his behaviour in any way.\n\n'He wishes to extend his apology directly to the victim but in the weeks leading up to this incident there were hopes of a future relationship between both parties.\n\n'He should have kept away rather than let his emotions get the better of him this night.'\n\nBooth will be on licence until the year 2039 following his release from jail under the terms of an extended sentence.'", "description": "Zahra Rechelle, from Glossop in Derbyshire, was held hostage for three hours by 27-year old Aaron Booth, who had terrorised her with a campaign of violent bullying.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19402388-0-image-a-2_1570461688691.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
