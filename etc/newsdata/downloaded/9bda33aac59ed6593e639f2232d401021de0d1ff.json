We are pleading with the community to be more vigilant.\u201d\n\nSAPS further urges the community to report all cases, as it gives them an indication of the areas where they need to focus and increase their patrols.\n\n\u201cWe analyse all the crime trends. Most cases are not reported, as people don\u2019t want to \u2018waste their time\u2019, unless they have insurance.\n\n\u201cBy not reporting cases we won\u2019t have the correct analysis of the crimes being committed.\n\n\u201cReporting of all cases will give the correct indication of what we are dealing with. It also helps to increase our station budget, resources and manpower.\n\n\u201cBe vigilant and continuously alert \u2014 we all need to have situational awareness. It\u2019s the small things; like checking your mirrors while driving to see if you are being followed; watching for movement in bushes and shrubs at your entrance; being aware of suspicious, slow-moving vehicles with tinted windows; and streetlights not working etc.\n\n\u201cWorking together, we all can make a difference in decreasing our crime rate,\u201d said the SAPS.", "description": "THE SOUTH African Police Service (SAPS) recently released the annual crime statistics for the period between April 2018 and March 2019.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
