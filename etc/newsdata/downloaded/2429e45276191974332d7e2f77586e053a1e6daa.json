Once you get the engagement loop going, we\u2019re going to be introducing other experiences.\u201d\n\nGood Today has experimented with company-wide giving before, but Teplow said the product has been designed largely for individuals, and that until now, \u201cIf you wanted to bring your company onto the platform, it was a little bit hack-y.\u201d\n\nGood Today for Teams is supposed to change that, allowing companies to sponsor their employees\u2019 donations, along with integrating into Slack (where employees can vote for their preferred charity) and providing a dashboard where administrators can track their team\u2019s votes and giving. It\u2019s already being used by more than 20 companies, including Shutterstock, Jeffries, Splash and Maverick.", "description": "Good Today offers a simple way for people to support a variety of charity organizations: By donating as little as 25 cents a day, supporters get a daily email allowing them to vote for one of two charity organizations, with the day\u2019s donations split based on the votes.
