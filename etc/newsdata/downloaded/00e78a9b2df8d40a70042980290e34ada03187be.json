Press Forward is an organization launched by journalists in the wake of the Me Too movement in 2017 to stop sexual harassment and create safer environments for women in newsrooms.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nSince Matt Lauer\u2019s firing, multiple news organizations, including Variety, have broken news about NBC News, which has denied having prior knowledge of Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his swift termination in November 2017. Following the release of Ronan Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d which revealed an on-the-record rape allegation from former NBC News employee Brooke Nevils, the news organization has come under fire, being subjected to much criticism specifically regarding the company\u2019s decision to conduct only an internal investigation of itself.\n\nVariety has reached out to Comcast for comment on the letter.\n\nThe letter comes just a day after Kelly went on Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News show, slamming her former employer NBC News for its Lauer investigation and for its handling of the Harvey Weinstein probe. Kelly very publicly departed Fox News after sexual harassment allegations against Roger Ailes and moved to NBC News, where she hosted her own morning show, \u201cMegyn Kelly Today.\u201d She parted ways with NBC following backlash for comments about blackface, though the anchor already had a contentious relationship with NBC brass.\n\nCarlson sued Ailes for sexual harassment, eventually encouraging others to come forward and resulting in Ailes\u2019 ouster from Fox News.\n\nTV news veteran Van Susteren had a brief stint at MSNBC after she departed her longtime post at Fox News in the aftermath of Ailes\u2019 ouster.\n\nVester, a former journalist at both NBC News and Fox News, accused Tom Brokaw of sexual harassment. During a months-long investigation conducted by Variety, she alleged that Brokaw physically tried to force her to kiss him on two separate occasions, groped her and showed up at her hotel room uninvited. Since her story was made public, Vester has continued to speak out against NBC News and has championed women\u2019s workplace safety, founding the Silence Breakers Alliance, a foundation to financially support efforts to end sexual harassment.\n\nZinone came forward to Variety about her secret relationship with Lauer that occurred when she was a production assistant at the \u201cToday\u201d show. Zinone appeared on Kelly\u2019s NBC show to discuss her story, shining light on an imbalance of power in the workplace.\n\nRead the statement in full below:\n\nTo Comcast Corp. Board of Directors and Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO:\n\nAs the parent company of NBC Universal, we appeal to you to overturn the network\u2019s refusal on Thursday to conduct an independent investigation of sexual misconduct and coverups at NBC News.\n\nThis week, the fearless reporting by Ronan Farrow and Rich McHugh exposed what many at NBC News have known for years: certain network executives have enabled a corporate culture of widespread sexual harassment and abuse, and are still trying to cover it up today.", "description": "A group of prominent women, all at the forefront of the Me Too movement, wrote a letter to Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, urging an external investigation of NBC News.
