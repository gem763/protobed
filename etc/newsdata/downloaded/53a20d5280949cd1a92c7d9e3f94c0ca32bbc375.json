The opera legend indicated that he would never again perform at the Met.\n\nDomingo had been scheduled to sing the title role in the season debut of Verdi\u2019s Macbeth on Wednesday night, which would have been his first performance in the United States since the AP reported that numerous women had accused him of inappropriate behavior, including one soprano who said he grabbed her bare breast.\n\nThe Met had been under increasing pressure to cancel Domingo\u2019s seven scheduled appearances, but its general manager, Peter Gelb, reiterated to performers after a dress rehearsal on Saturday that the opera house was awaiting results of investigations by the LA Opera, where Domingo has been general director since 2003, and the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union that represents various opera staff.\n\nDomingo, who had sung in rehearsals, issued a statement saying his Met career was over after what the company said was 706 performances.\n\nPl\u00e1cido Domingo accused by 11 more women of harassment Read more\n\n\u201cI made my debut at the Metropolitan Opera at the age of 27 and have sung at this magnificent theater for 51 consecutive, glorious years,\u201d the star said. \u201cWhile I strongly dispute recent allegations made about me, and I am concerned about a climate in which people are condemned without due process, upon reflection, I believe that my appearance in this production of Macbeth would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both on stage and behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cAs a result, I have asked to withdraw,\u201d he added, \u201cand I thank the leadership of the Met for graciously granting my request. I am happy that, at the age of 78, I was able to sing the wonderful title role in the dress rehearsal of Macbeth, which I consider my last performance on the Met stage.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, the Met said Domingo had \u201cagreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately\u201d.\n\nGelb sent an email to the Met staff on Tuesday saying: \u201cWe are grateful to him for recognizing that he needed to step down.\u201d\n\n\u017deljko Lu\u010di\u0107 will replace Domingo for the three performances of Macbeth. Domingo also had been scheduled for four performances as Sharpless in Puccini\u2019s Madama Butterfly at the Met in November.\n\nIn addition, Gelb said the Met was suspending the tenor Vittorio Grigolo pending the outcome of an investigation opened on Tuesday by the Royal Opera in London, which said he was alleged to be involved in an 18 September incident when he sang the title role in Gounod\u2019s Faust with the company on tour in Tokyo.\n\nGrigolo, 42, was scheduled to sing six performances of Alfredo in Verdi\u2019s La Traviata at the Met in February and March.", "description": "Opera singer drops role in Macbeth and agrees no longer to perform with New York company", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228e6b282a83605c3f729e7cceb1a2fa91760a7f/0_50_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49d394182195692c749ae8404b314e9a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
