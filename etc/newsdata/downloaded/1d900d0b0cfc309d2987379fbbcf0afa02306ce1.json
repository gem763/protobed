Like, she was an angel and I was this devil w**** - but we were really good friends.\n\n'By the end, Helena [Sauzier], Chelsie and I were the closest trio. I thought my edit was going to be that I was a \"sook\" - I cried every single day and in single interview.\n\n'I was so emotionally exhausted.'", "description": "The Bachelor's Abbie Chatfield has accused co-stars Rachael Arahill and Vakoo Kauapirura of faking their same-sex relationship.", "authors": ["Joshua Fox For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/02/19908966-0-image-a-24_1571447117452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
