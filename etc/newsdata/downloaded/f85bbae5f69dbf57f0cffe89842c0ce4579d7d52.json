The numbers in the House of Commons are very tight. It is of concern that one party is holding this up.\"", "description": "DUP statement seen as major setback for UK PM Boris Johnson, who needs party's support for any Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/17/e02c89cb9ab34b8cb63d645a7de2a7af_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
