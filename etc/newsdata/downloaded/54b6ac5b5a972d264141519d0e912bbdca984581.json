Its sales outlook for the holiday shopping season also disappointed analysts, and its stock sank 7% in after-hours trading.\n\nAmazon is moving to cut its delivery time in half to one day instead of two. To do that, it\u2019s adding more workers in its warehouses and expanding its shipping network with more trucks, jets and package sorting facilities.\n\nThe effort is costing the company about $1.5 billion, nearly double what it previously said it would cost. But Amazon said the one-day shipping is attracting more customers and gets shoppers to spend more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big investment,\u201d said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in a statement. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the right long-term decision for customers.\u201d\n\nThe Seattle-based company reported net income of $2.1 billion in the three months ending Sept. 30, down from $2.9 billion a year ago.\n\nEarnings per share came to $4.23. That\u2019s 36 cents less than what analysts expected, according to FactSet.\n\nThe company, which used to report razor-thin profits, has seen its quarterly profits grow in the past two years as it expanded into fast-growing businesses, such as cloud computing and advertising.\n\nSales at its cloud computing business, which powers video-streaming service Netflix and other companies, rose 35% from a year ago. And revenue in its \u201cother\u201d category, which the company said is mostly made up of its advertising business, jumped 44%.\n\nBut as Amazon grows it faces increasing scrutiny from regulators. The Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation of major tech companies and whether their platforms have hurt competition and stifled innovation. The department didn\u2019t name any companies, but it said online retailers were an area of \u201cwidespread concern.\u201d And the European Union is investigating how Amazon uses data from the small businesses that sell goods on its site.\n\nOn Thursday during a call with reporters, Amazon executives declined to answer any questions about regulation.\n\n\u201cI have nothing to report on that,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky.\n\nRevenue for the quarter beat expectations, rising 24% to $70 billion. The third quarter included Amazon\u2019s made-up sales holiday \u201cPrime Day,\u201d which has become one of the company\u2019s biggest shopping events of the year.\n\nAmazon also saw a jump in headcount. It had 750,000 worldwide employees at the end of September, up nearly 100,000 from the previous three months. Besides adding workers in its warehouses to pack and ship boxes, the company said it\u2019s been hiring more software engineers and salespeople for its cloud business. Amazon is the second-biggest U.S.-based private employer, just behind rival Walmart.\n\nFor the current quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, Amazon expects revenue between $80 billion and $86.5 billion. That\u2019s below the $87.4 billion analysts expected.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Amazon's push for faster delivery is hurting its profits.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Pisani"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/earns_amazon_80001_c0-128-3078-1923_s1200x700.jpg?6f5d039335b60238dbf08c25c96e6023c1202439", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
