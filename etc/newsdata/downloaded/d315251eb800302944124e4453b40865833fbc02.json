Those applications, a way to track gun sales, have been rising steadily, with a slight decline after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.\n\nGun sales usually go up when guy buyers feel their access to such weapons are being threatened, Winkler said, noting Colt's decision risks alienating and angering its customer base.\n\n\"We've seen in the past that when gun manufacturers are viewed to have given in to gun-safety advocates, gun owners will boycott them and really hurt their business,\" he said. \"If they think a company like Colt is disrespecting their identity or giving in to the other side, Colt's likely going to see serious damage to its other firearms brands too.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: AR-15: Colt suspends production of guns for civilian market", "description": "Gunmaker Colt is\u00a0suspending production of military-style\u00a0weapons for civilian use including the popular\u00a0AR-15.", "authors": ["Kelly Tyko", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BDK78eLtVWDi40Lb4j6bLQ--~B/aD0zMTkxO3c9NDk3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_money_325/b2d94037b88c40ae5b2c619dad76828a", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
