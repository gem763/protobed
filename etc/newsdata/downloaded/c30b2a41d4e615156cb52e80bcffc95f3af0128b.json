It was a top-heavy roster (Stephen Adams makes a lot of money, too) but one that won 49 games\u2026 and then got bounced in the first round of the playoffs by Portland.\n\nThat playoff loss seemed to show a ceiling for the Westbrook/George Thunder and had the franchise doing some soul searching.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHowever, in the wake of George forcing his way to the Clippers in a trade, rumors bubbled up that teams thought the Thunder wanted out of their expensive, non-contending team. Clippers coach Doc Rivers confirmed they knew that, speaking to Arash Markazi of the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cWe showed [Leonard] everybody else and he didn\u2019t want to hear it. He just stayed on Paul George, so after the meeting we sat down and I said, \u2018We got to get Paul George. I don\u2019t know how we are going to do it, but we have to do it.\u2019 We did know that Oklahoma City wanted to break their team up, so that helped, but we didn\u2019t know if we could get him.\u201d\n\nTurns out they could get him, but the price was high \u2014 one the Clippers saw as worth it, but steep nonetheless. For the Thunder, that high price is the foundation of a rebuild.\n\nHow did the Thunder get there?\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Damian Lillard sank his \u201cshot for Seattle\u201d that sent the Thunder home for the summer, it seems all the soul-searching in OKC had them thinking about breaking it all up earlier rather than later. If they really felt this is as far as they could go with Westbrook and George \u2014 and it would have been tough to put a much better team around them due to cap limitations, either way this was a team that needed a lot of things to go right to get out of the first round \u2014 then it made sense to move on if the right deal came along.\n\nFans in Oklahoma City have never had to sit through an NBA rebuild, the team that showed up from Seattle may have won only 29 games that first season but had Kevin Durant and Westbrook and was already a team on the rise. After that, the team has never won fewer than 45 games, had one Finals trip and years of contention. There\u2019s going to be some ugly basketball in OKC for a few years, we will see how that market reacts.", "description": "Doc Rivers confirms what others have hinted at.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VWL6_bKi0HJ5Eex.syH3gA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNzQ7aD03MTY-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MzRmtYHzOud7A16cM6v9DA--~B/aD0zNTg7dz02Mzc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/371a357de08fa91d40a23f9de3505019", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
