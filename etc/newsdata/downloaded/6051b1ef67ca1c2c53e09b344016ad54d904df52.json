He attacked Jeff Mason, you know, accused him of being 'fake news' and all that, when he asked a perfectly valid question,\" Hume said about Trump on Wednesday on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum.\"\n\nRENEWED INTEREST IN JOE BIDEN\u2019S OFFICIAL TRIP TO CHINA IN 2013 WITH SON HUNTER\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump appeared irritated when Mason repeatedly pressed the president on exactly what information he hoped to receive from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when Trump asked for an investigation into the Bidens. That July phone call ignited the Trump impeachment inquiry, as Democrats said the call was evidence of Trump asking a foreign country to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Trump told Mason, motioning for Mason to question the president of Finland, with whom Trump was addressing reporters. \u201cAsk him a question. I\u2019ve given you a long answer. Ask this gentlemen a question. Don\u2019t be rude.\u201d\n\nAfter Mason tried instead to ask Trump an additional question, Trump dismissed the impeachment allegations as a \u201choax\u201d and accused journalists of \u201cplaying into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I say in many cases, the corrupt media because you\u2019re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it\u2019s corrupt.\u201d\n\nHume was critical of the president's reaction.\n\n\"I don't think this sort of 'freaking out' that we're seeing from the president over this stuff, angry though he may legitimately be, helps his cause because it's not what people like about him,\" Hume said. \"And if you're going to get into an impeachment fight with a Congress you want as many people to like you as possible and I don't think it helps.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHume said the president didn't have a \"good answer\" to the question.\n\n\"That's why it was improper for the president to bring Biden into a conversation,\" Hume said.\n\nHe also doubted the American people would think Trump's conduct was impeachable.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume defended a Reuters reporter who angered\u00a0President Trump\u00a0with a question during a Wednesday news conference, claiming the reporter's question was\u00a0\"valid\" and saying the president \"freaking out\" doesn't help his cause.", "authors": ["Victor Garcia"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/02/694940094001_6091467387001_6091466013001-vs.jpg"}
