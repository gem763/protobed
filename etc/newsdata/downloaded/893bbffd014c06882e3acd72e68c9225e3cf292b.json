He was on the World Cup teams in 2010 and 2014, and both took first place. Curry told ESPN that he\u2019s excited to play in his first Olympics.\n\n\u201cDefinitely wanna go,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI've never been on the Olympic team. I've been on two World Cup Championship gold medal teams. But the Olympics is the experience that I want. And next year will hopefully be it.\u201d\n\nAvoiding another World Cup fiasco\n\nCurry announcing his intention to play now, just under a year before the Olympics, is a good sign for the team. The recent FIBA World Cup was an embarrassment for Team USA, with many talented, high-profile stars pulling out. The talent drain led to the seventh-place finish, the worst ever for the Americans.\n\nEven though the Olympics tend to draw the big stars, Curry committing now can only have a positive impact going forward. His presence could convince more of the NBA\u2019s best and brightest to join the team and avoid another disappointment like the FIBA World Cup.\n\nWhile no other big stars have committed like Curry has, Draymond Green recently told CNBC that he hopes to play in the Olympics in 2020, and LeBron James told The Athletic in April that playing for Team USA in 2020 is a possibility. Curry knows that the key to Team USA\u2019s success is getting the NBA\u2019s most talented players to join him on the court.\n\n\u201cWe're still the best,\u201d Curry told ESPN. \u201cIf we get the guys that are supposed to be there, in terms of, you know, representing us in the Olympic stage and the commitment's been there, and I think it'll be there next year.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Steph Curry has never played in the Olympics, and he wants 2020 to be his first.", "authors": ["Liz Roscher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MwlurYOkrOmNe_k2YueIiA--~B/aD0zMDg4O3c9NDUzNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/a7e5cfd0-96af-11e9-bdbf-a3bd817bfed0", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
