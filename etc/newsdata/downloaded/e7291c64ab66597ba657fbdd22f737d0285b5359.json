The damages, tied to blazes that its equipment ignited, forced the utility to file for Chapter 11 in January.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest twist in a massive bankruptcy case that has already attracted some of the biggest names in the financial world. A group led by Pimco and Elliott has already crafted a plan that would all but wipe out the stake of current shareholders in the utility. PG&E\u2019s shares plunged 21% to as low as $8.65 in after-markets trading.\n\nThe creditors have \u201cspoken loudly and clearly that they want their\u201d proposal to be considered, Montali said in his ruling.\n\nUnder bankruptcy law, a company has a limited amount of time to develop a reorganization plan and persuade creditors to vote in favor of it. Initially, no other competing proposals are allowed, so the bondholders needed permission from Montali before they could proceed. It\u2019s unusual for a bankruptcy judge to grant such a request.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 29 to address liabilities resulting from a series of devastating fires that tore through Northern California in 2017 and 2018. The effects have been rippling through millions of ratepayers, hundreds of creditors, thousands of workers and the state\u2019s political system.\n\nThe company has argued that ending its exclusive control before the company figures out its exact wildfire liabilities would \u201clead to further distraction, costs and waste\u201d and would jeopardize the company\u2019s chances of exiting bankruptcy by June 2020, a deadline set by the state.\n\nThe San Francisco-based utility said last week that it has already lined up $34 billion in debt financing for a reorganization. The company has also received more than $14 billion in equity commitments. It has blasted the plan by Elliott and Pimco, saying it would lead to an \u201cunjustified windfall\u201d of billions of dollars for creditors at the expense of shareholders and utility customers.\n\nNoteholders, meanwhile, said their efforts wouldn\u2019t delay the bankruptcy case. They\u2019ve joined forces with wildfire victims to pitch a plan that would pay out $25.5 billion to victims and their insurers. Their campaign to end PG&E\u2019s exclusive control was supported by the official committee of unsecured creditors, labor unions and fire victims.\n\nMontali had already ruled in August that PG&E should retain exclusive control over its restructuring and said last week that the group led by Pimco and Elliott would have to explain \u201cwhat has changed in such a short period of time to justify reversing course.\u201d\n\nThe case is PG&E Corp. 19-bk-30088, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Northern District of California (San Francisco)\n\n(Updates with shares in third paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Steven Church in Wilmington, Delaware at schurch3@bloomberg.net;Mark Chediak in San Francisco at mchediak@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Lynn Doan\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- California power giant PG&E Corp. was stripped of its right to exclusively pitch a reorganization plan in court, escalating an already-heated battle over the largest utility bankruptcy in U.S. history.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said he\u2019ll allow bondholders including Pacific Investment", "authors": ["Steven Church", "Mark Chediak"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6H.EL2lVGy0E7JJIKcdI7Q--~B/aD0xMjM3O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8b73c1d6e3e968a2ab2bf329e11e4b6f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
