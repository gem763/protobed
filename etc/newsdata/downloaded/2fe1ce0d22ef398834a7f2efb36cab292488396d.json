On Sept. 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France came to Poland\u2019s defense, and suddenly World War II was underway. Estimates of civilian and military deaths in the war go as high as 85 million.\n\nCould there be a World War III?\n\nWhile there have been many wars since World War II ended in 1945, the major powers have never launched all-out war against each other since then. Leaders know if they ever turned to nuclear weapons, the nightmarish death toll would make World War II look like a minor skirmish.\n\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON: LIES, BETRAYAL AND INCREDIBLE SURPRISES MARKED START OF WORLD WAR II 80 YEARS AGO\n\nBut no one can predict the future or say that World War III would be impossible. Regional wars and crises have the potential to explode, with actions and unanticipated reactions leading events to spin out of control.\n\nThere are a number of global hotspots today.\n\nChina now seems determined to try to dominate Asia and create its own sphere of influence, while subjugating its own citizens to tyrannical rule, as we see with its efforts to crush demonstrators fighting for more freedom in Hong Kong.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has mourned the breakup of the old Soviet Union. He has rebuilt Russia\u2019s armed forces and started and stopped frozen conflicts in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia \u2013 all formerly part of the Soviet Union. With NATO and Russian forces now probing each other\u2019s air and naval spaces on a daily basis \u2013 and with both sides now likely arming with dangerous missile platforms that were once banned under an expired treaty \u2013 we don\u2019t know what could happen if things get out of control.\n\nThe anniversary of the start of World War II should remind us of the sacrifices and heroism of the Greatest Generation. And it should serve as a reminder to leaders of all nations that the world remains a very dangerous place, where a spark can turn into a deadly conflagration in an instant.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t forget about North Korea. President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have held three historic meetings. But the North has not wound down its nuclear weapons and missile programs, and has now even gone back to testing short-range missiles. Kim has threatened by the end of the year to embrace a \u201cnew way\u201d that could mean a return to nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missile testing, setting the stage for another round of rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nUnfortunately, the possibility of armed conflict involving the U.S. has not dissipated. In fact, in the years to come, I would argue there are three specific flashpoints that must be watched carefully in order to ensure that World War III never becomes a reality.\n\nCyberspace: World War III could very well begin in a domain that never existed during World War II.\n\nNo treaties or international bodies police the conduct of nations on the Internet. So cyberspace has become like a 21 century Wild West frontier town, with no rules to keep the gunslingers from battling it out for supremacy. In cyberspace hackers are working to steal intelligence, intellectual property and military technology. This could escalate into attacks that would disable a nation\u2019s power grid, plunging it into darkness for weeks or even months, or other actions that would cause catastrophic damage.\n\nWe should never discount the possibility that a rogue nation or terrorist group could go too far or make a tragic mistake, accidentally employing a cyberweapon that leads to the death of innocent civilians or severe damage to the global economy.\n\nThat could cause the accidental or intended target to strike back with military force. In that case, the stage could be set for the very first cyberwar in history that could draw in nations from around the globe with terrible consequences in the physical world.\n\nA U.S.-China Trade War Becomes a Shooting War: Imagine if the world\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 worth around $32 trillion combined \u2013 started shooting at each other. Think that\u2019s impossible? History tells us it\u2019s entirely possible, and the spark could be today\u2019s current trade war.\n\nChina has already declared its economic performance a \u201ccore interest\u201d \u2013 meaning that Beijing would fight to ensure its continued success. If the U.S.-China trade war escalates to the point that Chinese leaders believe a recession is imminent, Beijing could gamble that a show of military force is necessary.\n\nIn that case, China could take an aggressive action in the South China Sea, demand to take control of Taiwan, or even an attack critical commercial Earth-orbiting satellites vital to our economy and military.\n\nA U.S. counter-response \u2013 with China retaliating \u2013 could spark a war in Asia that would surely draw in most U.S. allies in the region and launch a global crisis of epic proportions.\n\nA Korea Crisis: Imagine a situation where the current trend lines continue. Kim Jong Un could decide to break his verbal promise to President Trump and test the ultimate weapon \u2013 an ICBM with a fully developed warhead that drops down into the atmosphere and survives reentry.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nA test like this would prove once and for all that not only do Kim\u2019s missiles have the range, but they can now deliver a nuclear payload to the United States. The stage would be set for a showdown, perhaps prompting President Trump to order an attack and end Kim\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programs once and for all.\n\nShould the U.S. and North Korea plunge into a nuclear conflict, millions of people could be killed, as I wrote about previously in a Fox News op-ed.\n\nOther regional conflicts around the world could, of course, escalate out of control as well. That\u2019s because global peace is a fragile commodity. One wrong move could start a chain reaction that \u2013 in the worst-case scenario \u2013 could culminate in the chain reaction of nuclear bombs.\n\nSome people who lived through the horrible war that began exactly 80 years ago are still alive today. The rest of us have parents, grandparents or great-grandparents who lived through those terrible days or who died in World War II.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe anniversary of the start of World War II should remind us of the sacrifices and heroism of the Greatest Generation. And it should serve as a reminder to leaders of all nations that the world remains a very dangerous place, where a spark can turn into a deadly conflagration in an instant.\n\nLet us hope and pray that World War III remains just a nightmare that never becomes a reality, and that future generations do not have to mark the anniversary of the start of such a conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HARRY KAZIANIS", "description": "On Sept. 1, 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland.
