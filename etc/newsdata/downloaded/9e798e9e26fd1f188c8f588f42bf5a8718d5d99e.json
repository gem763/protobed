That\u2019s where they first put you to get acclimated to the prison life,\u201d Miller told reporters at the awards show.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to get a job because she won\u2019t be there long enough. She\u2019s not going to learn how to be a plumber and how to do HVAC and how to do all the things that you have to do to go over to the men\u2019s prison\u2019s and do. That\u2019s why they have camps. That\u2019s why women are in a prison so we can go make lunches when they all get in a fight. It\u2019s ridiculous. It is the most absurd nonsense you have ever seen in your life,\u201d Miller added.\n\nSteven Ferdman/Getty Images; Elise Amendola/AP/Shutterstock More\n\nSpeaking of her own experience behind bars, the Dance Moms star, 52, said that while prison is \u201cterrifying\u201d it gives you \u201ca lot of time to work on yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy life was dedicated to other people\u2019s children. I made other people\u2019s children stars and financially set for the rest of their lives,\u201d she said, explaining that in jail she \u201cgot to work on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took a real estate class. I took a finance class. I made friends with women that I don\u2019t think should have been there either,\u201d she added, noting that she would love to talk about to Kim Kardashian West about criminal justice reform.\n\nRELATED: John Legend Reacts to Felicity Huffman\u2019s 14-Day Sentence: \u2018Prisons and Jails Are Not the Answer\u2019\n\nMiller went on to share that she believed Huffman would be just fine at the end of her sentence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll come out. She\u2019ll make a huge movie out of it. She\u2019ll make millions of dollars,\u201d she said.\n\nFelicity Huffman More\n\nRELATED: Felicity Huffman Likely to Serve Majority of 14-Day Jail Sentence: Expert\n\nHuffman, 56, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud, was sentenced to 14 days behind bars on Friday.
