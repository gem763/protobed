Today, customer relationship management company Salesforce unveiled Sustainability Cloud, software that helps businesses track and analyze their environmental data. The announcement has been cautiously welcomed by environmental groups optimistic that Salesforce\u2019s huge reach might make companies more willing to take a second look at their environmental footprint.\n\nOther software tools are available that offer similar services. But Salesforce has a huge size advantage over its competitors. Over 150,000 businesses and organizations, including big names like Amazon Web Services, Adidas, and Farmers Insurance, rely on Salesforce for its tech and customer relations services. The hope is that some of those companies might find carbon accounting more attractive and accessible if the tools used to track it come from an already recognized and trusted source.\n\nThe announcement has been cautiously welcomed by environmental groups\n\n\u201cIt could represent a possibility to kind of spread the gospel, you know, reach a larger audience and empower them to track that type of information,\u201d says Wiley Barbour, a senior project director at the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, a nonprofit organization that provides training on greenhouse gas accounting and auditing. \u201cThe question would be, how many of those companies and entities that use Salesforce have not thought about doing a greenhouse gas inventory, haven\u2019t thought about what their footprint is?\u201d Barbour says.\n\nBarbour tells The Verge that in his work consulting with other companies on their carbon accounting, he\u2019s often surprised to find how many big actors rely on lower-tech solutions like spreadsheets. \u201cI\u2019m always struck by how many really, really large companies are still just cranking away [at] gigantic spreadsheets,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in these spreadsheets with 30,000 rows of electricity data and fuel consumption data.\u201d\n\nSalesforce\u2019s Sustainability Cloud stems from the system it developed to track its own carbon footprint. Its emissions have grown each fiscal year between 2017 and 2019, from 149,000 to 244,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for its data centers. The company attributes the increased emissions to its growth, and has pledged to reach 100 percent renewable energy usage by 2022. It says it reached net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through the use of offsets in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe were really looking at getting our environmental data in not only excellent shape, but in a way that we could make it investor grade and be very transparent about it. We built a system internally to manage all of our carbon accounting issues, and are now turning that on for customers,\u201d Suzanne DiBianca, chief impact officer at Salesforce, tells The Verge. \u201cWe\u2019re just bringing the full power of Salesforce to the climate issue.\u201d\n\nSustainability Cloud streamlines the process of measuring things like energy usage and travel and can help convert that information into how much planet-warming carbon emissions the company generated. The product will be available to existing and new customers in December of this year. But the company has made a beta version available to 10 of its clients, including e-signature company DocuSign.\n\nPrior to using Sustainability Cloud, DocuSign, like others, relied on spreadsheets to crunch their environmental numbers. Salesforce\u2019s new system offers a more user-friendly way to get some key take-aways from that data. \u201cA huge part of the power of this app is in being able to observe and manage trends over time,\u201d Amy Skeeters-Behrens, executive director of DocuSign IMPACT, the company\u2019s global philanthropic initiative, tells The Verge, saying that the app has already identified some areas where the company could reduce its environmental footprint.\n\nThe sheer size of Salesforce and its potential reach could also spark another fundamental shift in how the private sector measures its carbon. If enough customers start using it, it could lead to a more standardized way for measuring impact. If companies are all measuring their environmental impact in a more comparable way, Barbour says that whatever number a company comes up with, \u201cit would represent the same environmental good or bad that another company\u2019s calculations did.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of companies really stepping up\u201d\n\nBut the new tool\u2019s mainstream appeal could come with challenges. There\u2019s a reason why many companies choose to stick with spreadsheets or use their own specialized carbon accounting programs \u2014 they\u2019re easier to customize to a particular industry or field if they stay in-house. \u201cCompany attributes need to be taken into account to ensure that everything\u2019s accurate and up to date with best practices and consistent with standards,\u201d Nicole Labutong, a managing consultant with the firm Navigant tells The Verge. Labutong helps companies reduce their adverse environmental impacts.\n\nCost is also a concern. \u201cSustainability departments are resource constrained, even for large companies,\u201d Labutong says. Salesforce has yet to set a price on its new tool, but it\u2019s likely to cost companies more than what they\u2019re spending on spreadsheets.\n\nBarbour also cautions that success may not come easily for Salesforce. He has seen other software come and go, and seen the companies who used them revert back to the spreadsheets they\u2019re comfortable with. Big polluters, particularly those who are mandated to watch their emissions, already often have their own systems for measuring how much crap they\u2019re belting out into the atmosphere. Salesforce has the potential to reach a new audience of climate-concerned companies who volunteer to monitor their impact on the planet. But, like any product, success will hinge on demand.\n\nDaniel Hill, manager of Environmental Defense Fund\u2019s Climate Corps program, however, isn\u2019t too worried about that. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of companies really stepping up on making voluntary commitments,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cwith that increase in goal setting, there\u2019s this natural need and demand for more services and tools.\u201d", "description": "Companies looking to reign in their contributions to climate change will soon have a new way to track just how much pollution they\u2019re putting into the atmosphere.
