There is tremendous pressure on the government for a stimulus. But you cannot keep spending, something has got to give,\u201d Rajan said in his OP Jindal Lecture at Brown University in the US recently.\n\nThe former IMF chief economist maintained that the stress in sectors such as finance and real estate was a symptom, and not the cause, of the slowdown.\n\n\u201cThe reason it is in stress is that we have not generated sufficient growth more broadly,\u201d said Rajan.\n\nBlaming centralisation for the Modi government\u2019s inability to progress on the economic front, he stated: \u201cModi did not do better in the economy during the first term because the government is extremely centralised which puts a lot of pressure on the leadership, which does not have a consistent, articulated vision on how to achieve growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMinisters are disempowered. The bureaucrats are unwilling to take decisions on their own and do not have a strong idea of serious reform\u2026 The bureaucracy\u2019s effectiveness has been diminished because in parallel India is running a campaign against corruption in the past. For a bureaucrat there is no significant upside to taking action if he can be subject to vigilant (sic) inquiry by the next administration,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cEven senior officials have been held in custody without upfront evidence. I do worry that the former finance minister has been held in jail without trial for over a month,\u201d said Rajan.\n\n\u201cBecause of the weakness of institutions every government runs the risk of turning authoritarian. This was true about Indira Gandhi after 1971 as it is true of the Modi government in 2019,\u201dhe lamented.\n\nRajan noted that even though majoritarianism may win elections, it is taking India down a \u201cdark and uncertain path\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndia is better off strengthening its democracy and decentralising,\u201d he said.", "description": "Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, who is known for his severe criticism of the PM Narendra Modi-led ruling BJP dispensation in India on the economic front, has fired a fresh set of salvos in which he has observed that India is headed into a \u201cdark and uncertain path\u201d as a result of majoritarianism and authoritarianism.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/economy_1570950935_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
