Jerry Brown that bars state-funded travel to other states that undercut LGBT rights. The blacklist already included Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma and Mississippi.\n\nWATCH: LIBERAL POLICIES BLAMED FOR WORSENING CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS\n\nConservatives have called the law ineffective, inconveniencing, possibly unconstitutional and hypocritical. The state's sports teams have turned to private funding to get around the restrictions, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cThe Iowa Legislature has reversed course on what was settled law under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, repealing protections for those seeking gender-affirming health care,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cCalifornia has taken an unambiguous stand against discrimination and government actions that would enable it.\"\n\nThe brouhaha began after the Iowa Supreme Court ruled in March that taxpayers could be forced to pay for gender reassignment surgery. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law effectively overriding that ruling two months later.\n\n\"This narrow provision simply clarifies that Iowa\u2019s Civil Rights Act does not require taxpayer dollars to pay for sex reassignment and other similar surgeries,\" Reynolds spokesman Pat Garrett said in a statement at the time. \"This returns us to what had been the state\u2019s position for years.\"\n\nAt the federal level, the Trump administration has rolled back the Obama-era determination that sex-based discrimination prohibitions under existing law include protections for gender identity.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department, in May, angered progressive advocates with rules that both allowed doctors not to perform certain operations and stated that \"gender identity\" was not protected under sex discrimination law in health care.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,\" said Roger Severino, who heads the HHS Office for Civil Rights. \"We intend to fully enforce federal laws that prohibit discrimination.\"\n\nAsked about the charge that the administration has opened the door to discrimination against transgender people seeking needed medical care of any type, Severino responded, \"I don't want to see that happen.\"\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.", "description": "California announced Monday that it has added Iowa to the list of states on its \"travel ban\" because of its new prohibition against funding gender-transition surgeries under Medicaid.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
