And one of the greatest examples of this ever is Joe Biden's story about Corn Pop the gangsta.\"\n\nHarriot goes on to explain that the story, which Biden recounted in his 2007 autobiography and was published in The Washington Post, has some unlikely plot points, especially when considering historical context.\n\nWhen telling his story, Biden has said that he worked as the only white lifeguard at the Prices Run swimming pool in Brown-Burton Winchester Park in Wilmington, Delaware. The pool has since been renamed the Joseph R. Biden Aquatic Center - at the dedication ceremony, Biden told the story again, and video of his retelling also circulated on Twitter.\n\nIn some instances, Harriot wrote that Biden frames his story by explaining that he wanted to work at a black pool \"in hopes of learning more about the black community.\" Biden also said he was popular among pool-goers, because most of them hadn't talked to a white person before.\n\nThis, as Harriot points out, is suspicious, because the census from Wilmington in 1960 shows the town was 73% white. Biden goes on to say that a group of gang members called \"The Romans\" came to the pool, including the gang leader Corn Pop. Biden says he yelled at Corn Pop to stop bouncing on the diving board, calling him Esther Williams, after the famous 50s female swimmer.\n\nAfter Biden insulted Corn Pop, the gang leader supposedly said he'd meet the future vice president outside his car when he got off work. Biden says Corn Pop showed up with three guys and straight razors, but that a white mechanic working at the pool cut a six-foot length of chain from the line that separated the deep end for Biden to arm himself with.\n\nRead more: If everyone except for Biden, Bernie, and Warren dropped out of the 2020 race right now, Biden would be the clear loser\n\nIn the video from the pool renaming ceremony, Biden also explains that the straight razors wielded by Corn Pop and his fellow gang members were rusty, since that was apparently a common method of street fighting at the time. Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for calling him Esther Williams but insisted that he couldn't mess around on the diving board. And that, apparently, made Corn Pop close his razor and decide to be friends with Biden.\n\nHarriot casts plenty of doubt on the story, which he wrote \"sounds like some white kid tried to make a gang fairy tale for a sixth-grade play.\" He also pointed out that if Biden had really been threatened, he probably would have called the police rather than confront a rusty razor with six feet of pool chain.\n\nAt the same pool renaming ceremony, former NAACP President Richard \"Mouse\" Smith gave his own firsthand account of the incident, since he was apparently there, too. He commented that Biden used some \"colorful\" language when urging Corn Pop to get off the diving board.\n\nGiven that the incident in question happened over 50 years ago, there's no doubt that some of the facts may have slipped Biden's mind. As Harriot commented, \"Now I don't know how it works where you live, but in my hood, you don't actually get a laminated street credential card from the neighborhood thug council but, then again, I've never been on the mean streets of Wilmington.\"", "description": "A resurfaced story from Joe Biden's lifeguarding days drew skepticism on Twitter, especially since his tale involves a gang leader named 'Corn Pop.'", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7e840b21214c47e82fd6fb-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
