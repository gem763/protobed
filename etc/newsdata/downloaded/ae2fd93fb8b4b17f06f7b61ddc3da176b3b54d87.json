When the masked cops with sticks start beating the local peasants, we end up rooting for the cops because technically the regime is protecting our interests.\n\nBut again, the U.S. establishment foreign policy consensus \u2014 a consensus that I often agree with! \u2014 is so deeply ingrained that some of its adherents sometimes can\u2019t believe that anyone could honestly disagree; anyone who\u2019s challenging it must be doing so out of bad faith or sinister motives.\n\nUntil Hillary Clinton or anyone else generates some actual proof, treat Tulsi Gabbard for what she appears to be \u2014 an impassioned isolationist who believes the United States has no business attempting to spread our values or stand up for human rights abroad, and who\u2019s comfortable working with brutal dictators if the end result is fewer American casualties.
