He stopped flying on the city\u2019s flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., where some staff took part in protests and others were fired after investigations into depleted oxygen tanks. With battles between police and black-clad mobs becoming pervasive, Min said he\u2019s considered moving his business to Shanghai and his family to Canada.\n\n\u201cThey have no moral bottom line as to what they\u2019ll do to achieve their goals,\u201d Min, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retribution, said of the protesters. \u201cFingers crossed, I believe the police can crush this.\u201d\n\nThe strife ripping through Hong Kong -- with police officers and protesters in hand-to-hand combat, subway stations set ablaze and an improvised explosive device detonated near a police car -- looks very different to the city\u2019s mainland-born residents. Since Hong Kong\u2019s handover from the U.K. to China in 1997, professionals from the mainland flocked to the city, and they now make up more than 1 million among the population of about 7.5 million.\n\nThe protests began in opposition to a since-scrapped government bill allowing extraditions to mainland China and have expanded to include calls for greater democracy and an independent inquiry into police tactics. While the majority of protesters are peaceful, the demonstrations often feature a darker, anti-China tone. Some demonstrators have burned Chinese flags and spray-painted the phrases \u201cChinazi\u201d and \u201cHong Kong is not China!\u201d across the city. Others have attacked mainland Chinese.\n\nThis past weekend, gangs ransacked or destroyed Chinese bank branches and retail businesses, including an outlet for smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. based in Beijing.\n\nThe tensions between mainlanders and locals also surface in daily office interactions.\n\n\u201cEmployees are generally encouraged to not discuss this topic at work and to leave political opinions at home,\u201d said Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive officer of financial-services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. Still, \u201cyou can\u2019t segregate a private and corporate life so cleanly, and there will inevitably be opinions on politics that don\u2019t gel among colleagues.\u201d\n\n\u2018Go Back to the Mainland!\u2019\n\nWhen crowds surged into the streets recently, Yang, a 34-year-old finance professional from China, watched from above in one of the city\u2019s gleaming skyscrapers.\n\nTVs in the office -- and desktop live-streams -- were all tuned to the protests against Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s impending use of a colonial-era emergency powers law to ban face masks on demonstrators. Mobile phones buzzed with messages flowing across WeChat groups about looming protests and violence outside, including one alarming video of a Chinese banker from JPMorgan Chase & Co. getting punched in the head by a protester, and someone yelling: \u201cGo back to the mainland!\u201d\n\nYang, who asked to be identified only by one name, also is scared to speak Mandarin and has been regularly fleeing across the border to nearby Shenzhen to escape the violence. That Friday afternoon, she left early and dashed to meet her husband and daughter at the bus station, right before the city descended into its worst violence on the weekend of Oct. 5.\n\n\u2018So Stressed\u2019\n\n\u201cAs I rushed to the bus station to regroup with my family, I was so stressed -- hearing my heart beating quickly and strongly,\u201d she said, adding she bought the last three tickets for a bus that whisked them all to Shenzhen, which was celebrating 70 years of Communist rule with buildings and billboards decked out in red lights.\n\n\u201cWhen the bus crossed the bridge and was about to enter Shenzhen, we all saw the red neon at the other side of the river,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt suddenly relaxed.\u201d\n\nIn the financial sector, the conflicts between those sympathetic to protesters and those aligned with Beijing can be seen in instances both subtle and dramatic.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- As Hong Kong\u2019s historic protests become increasingly violent, mainland Chinese living in the city are becoming increasingly fearful.Min, who moved to Hong Kong from the mainland in 1995 and now runs his own hedge fund, said the startling escalation in mayhem prompted him to tell his children", "authors": ["Bei Hu", "Alfred Cang", "Alfred Liu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nMa3YFiqm_xkKNIgyPjbOA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d938114629797becb1838fa262c46d1e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
