Tony Abbott, the former Australian Prime Minister was applauded for calling the UK's parliament \"contemptible\" and that it's not \"possible to be a remainer today if you also want to be a democrat.\"\n\nLiam Fox, a former British Cabinet minister, told a room of delighted Euroskeptics that once Britain leaves the EU, \"Germany will become the biggest ATM in history.\" One audience member yelled back \"they deserve it.\"\n\nAnd when former minister Francis Maude reminded an audience that his signature could be found on the Maastricht treaty, which founded the European Union, they booed. Not Maude, but the treaty itself.\n\nBoris Johnson, seen at the Conservative Party conference, with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, currently enjoys rock-star status, as do many of his inner circle.\n\nNew members love hard Brexit line\n\nConservative membership has grown since Brexit. And moderate Conservatives think much of this is coming from those new entrants. \"Lots of people joined to help make Boris Prime Minister. They joined the Conservative party because of Brexit, but they are not Conservatives. And that's forcing other people out,\" says Patrick Lohlein, national director of Conservatives for a People's Vote. \"Their chief interest is to get Brexit done above everything else.\"\n\nIt's certainly true that Johnson has attracted new party members who love his hard line on Brexit. But the Conservative Party has had a strong Euroskeptic strain for decades, and Johnson also had the support of these members during his bid for leadership.\n\nHe can take comfort in the fact that most of his own party supports both him as a leader and his plan for Brexit, which was unveiled on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe plan went down less well in Brussels. Consensus across the EU is that Johnson has submitted a plan that doesn't work and that he's not taking getting a Brexit deal seriously. If he does want a deal, he is going to have to make concessions to Europe.\n\nThat's where things get messy.\n\nThe Conservative party's hardest Euroskeptics are willing to support Johnson's Brexit plan for now, but are at the absolute limit of what they will accept in terms of cooperating with Brussels. They claim that Johnson's plan could secure a majority in Parliament. But if Johnson is seen to kneel before the EU, that could quickly melt.\n\nJUST WATCHED Boris Johnson's plan prompts fears of violence on Irish border Replay More Videos ...

Johnson's plan isn't all that different from Theresa May's hated Brexit deal. It removes the controversial Irish border backstop, sure, but doesn't touch any of the other stuff that Brexiteers hated -- most notably the \u00a339 billion ($48 billion) divorce bill that the UK will have to hand over.\n\nIf Johnson does soften in the coming days, it's going to be tricky for MPs who voted against May's deal to say that whatever Johnson gets from Brussels is worth \u00a339 billion while keeping a straight face.\n\n\"The Prime Minister will have significant problem with the membership if he, in their eyes, 'capitulates' to Europe. The membership are required to get the vote out in any subsequent election, and this I am sure will be at forefront of the PM's mind,\" explains Lauren McEvatt, a former government special advisor.\n\nBrexiteer MP Andrea Jenkyns railed at \"the liberal media,\" the \"establishment\" and \"those cowards in parliament\" allegedly holding up Brexit. And she applauded her colleague Steve Baker as he accused a former finance minister from his own party of believing in \"Trotskyite conspiracy theories.\" Will the activists who so enthusiastically cheered those remarks, knock on doors for Johnson if he too joins the ranks of the apostates?\n\nPhotos: In photos: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Britain's new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London on Wednesday, July 24.

His most senior adviser, the controversial Dominic Cummings, was mobbed at every appearance he made in Manchester, sometimes to the sound of fans singing \"Oh, Dominic Cummings.\" They don't seem to care that he isn't a member of their party, just that he is driving the UK out of the EU, come hell or highwater.\n\nHowever, the moment of truth is just around the corner. Johnson needs to reach a deal with Brussels in days. His current proposals are simultaneously nowhere near soft enough for the EU and at the very edge of what Brexiteers will tolerate. Bluntly, he has miles to travel with next to no fuel in the tank.\n\nBoris Johnson is a man with very few options. He can capitulate to Brussels to get a deal and risk it tanking in Parliament. He can accept that there is no deal to be done right now, request a Brexit extension and call an election. Or he can try and press ahead with a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNone of the options are particularly attractive and they all come with the risk that Johnson, should he mess things up, is booted out of office as the shortest-serving prime minister in history.
