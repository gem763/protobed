We must have an election as soon as possible to break this deadlock and decide the future for our country. 1/3 \u2014 Sajid Javid (@sajidjavid) October 24, 2019\n\nJavid's delivery of the national budget, planned for November 6, has been cancelled in the interim while the House of Commons struggles to get its affairs in order. Opposition parties indicated Javid would most certainly not have the requisite two-thirds majority needed for the budget to pass.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has adopted a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approach to proceedings, with a view to removing the potential for a \u2018no-deal Brexit.\u2019\n\n\u201cTake no-deal off the table and we will absolutely support an election. I\u2019ve been calling for an election ever since the last one because this country needs one in order to deal with all the social injustices, but no-deal must be taken off the table,\u201d Corbyn said, insisting that his party would await the European Council's decision on the extension before playing its hand with regards the general election motion.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
