I think I\u2019ve found a deal that would work for me. I want to take $20,000 out of my thrift savings account to use as a down payment on the property. I could rent the place for $1,400 a month, and my loan payment would be $1,100 a month. What do you think about this idea?\n\nNathan\n\nDear Nathan,\n\nI love real estate, so I understand the allure. But what you\u2019re telling me is you want to cash out part of your retirement, get hit with a penalty and take on debt, to buy an investment property. I wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nI\u2019ve got a feeling you\u2019ve never been a landlord before. Bringing in $1,400 and paying out $1,100 may seem like a good place to be, but you haven\u2019t figured all the risk into your equation. Rental properties just sit there empty sometimes. Other times you have renters who don\u2019t pay, repairs, and people who just tear up things. In other words, you won\u2019t be able to count on an easy $300 in your pocket every month.\n\nLike I said, I totally get your fascination with real estate. But my advice is to save up, and pay cash for one decent rental property to see if this game is really for you.\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,I\u2019m 35, and I\u2019ve always wanted to own rental .10/07/2019 15:47:02PM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/4/7b562676-7439-4fe1-ac71-4f8ef9aa3f34.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
