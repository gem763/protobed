Song zhong is a homophone for the phrase meaning \u201cto see off a dying relative.\u201d (It is also incidentally a homophone for the phrase \u201cto give a clock,\u201d which is why a clock is always considered an unlucky gift in China, effectively wishing death upon the recipient.) The slogan thus has death embedded in it, and so could be understood to mean \u201cOppose sending us to our death\u201d\u2014whether by extradition to China, or through the death of civil liberties in Hong Kong.\n\nFor the first mass rally of these protests\u2014on June 9, in which more than 1 million people took to the streets\u2014participants dressed in white, the traditional color of mourning in Chinese culture, and chanted their death-laced slogan. A week later, at an even larger rally of 2 million people, the largest in Hong Kong\u2019s history, participants dressed in the West\u2019s traditional mourning color of black. This time there was an actual death to mourn. The night before, a protester had climbed scaffolding erected outside a shopping center, strung up a banner bearing the movement\u2019s slogans, and appeared to be threatening to jump; in what seemed to be a tragic accident, rescue workers had slipped trying to save him, and the demonstrator fell to his death. The next day, protesters carried white flowers\u2014markets across the city reportedly sold out their entire stock\u2014and a shrine grew outside the mall as people piled those flowers in tribute, lit candles and incense, and left messages of condolence. More suicides would follow; some left messages supporting the protests before leaping to their deaths. In total, as many as eight such deaths have been associated with the protest movement.\n\nThen, when Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam initially announced that the extradition bill would not be proceeding, she also turned to mortality-tinged metaphors. In her English statement to the press, she said bluntly, \u201cThe bill is dead.\u201d The phrase she used was also death-related: The bill was \u201cshou zhong zheng qin,\u201d meaning that it had \u201cdied a natural death in its bed,\u201d something that online critics were quick to point out did not reflect the true state of affairs surrounding a bill that effectively had been killed by the protesters.\n\nThis willingness to invoke death so directly\u2014in words and imagery\u2014is significant. Hong Kong is traditionally deeply superstitious, and death-related symbols are anathema. The number four is considered unlucky because it is a homophone for death, and many apartment blocks, for example, lack a fourth floor; it is considered inauspicious to stick chopsticks vertically into a rice bowl, because it is reminiscent of incense sticks burning to commemorate the dead.\n\nBut death is something protesters now appear willing to contemplate. In recent weeks, violence on the part of both demonstrators and police has reached levels not seen in Hong Kong since the Cultural Revolution riots of the late 1960s. The Umbrella Movement was sparked by outrage at police using tear gas during a single incident. For over a month now, tear gas has been deployed almost every single weekend. Police have also turned to rubber bullets, pepper pellets, beanbag rounds, and\u2014debuting them at a recent weekend protest\u2014water cannons. Officers have on several occasions drawn their service weapons and, in a couple of instances, fired warning shots into the air.", "description": "Previous demonstrations in the city were colorful, hopeful, and exuberant.
