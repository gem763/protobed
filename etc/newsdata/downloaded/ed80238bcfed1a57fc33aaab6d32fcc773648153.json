[Photo/IC]\n\nChinese online anchors might lose their chance to clear their names for video streaming, as on Monday the China Association of Performing Arts denied a rumor spread online big cities like Beijing and Shanghai will certify them with licenses.\n\nThere is no regulation for online anchors to be certified, according to an official announcement from its Online Live Performance (Streaming) Branch published on Sina Weibo. It also said the industry has not yet been equipped with a vocational certification system.\n\nEarlier, 10 cities had been reportedly chosen to test the waters in training online anchors for authentication, after finished courses at a training center and passing an exam. These reports came after another in June, when a training project for network program hosts in Sichuan was officially launched.\n\nThe topic has been subject to heated discussion among Chinese netizens. Some thought online anchors should be equal to TV hosts, with formal training and legalized certification. It might help enhance the standing of the webcast industry and prevent some low-quality anchors from entering live broadcast circles.\n\nSome remain doubtful over the certification, saying the majority of online anchors are not professional and do it as a part-time job. They might not need certification to improve themselves.\n\nIn recent years, the online celebrity economy has been reverberating across the nation, but bringing along plenty of chaos as well.\n\nIn August, a Chinese web host known by the stage name Qiaobiluo, was blacklisted from streaming for at least five years. The 59-year-old cheated online fans by covering her face with emojis or altering her face to look younger.\n\nAnother person on the ban list issued by the association is Chinese hip-hop rapper Beibei, who engaged in self-mutilation on camera during a quarrel with fans. An online celebrity called Li Ge even mocked the national anthem on Douyin to attract more fans, promoting online protests among Chinese netizens.\n\nDespite this fact, some still request the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security seek public opinions on legalizing online anchors and standardizing the industry, as statistics from the China National Internet Data Platform show there were 20 million online anchors last year.", "description": "Chinese online anchors might lose their chance to clear their names for video streaming, as on Monday the China Association of Performing Arts denied a rumor spread online big cities like Beijing and Shanghai will certify them with licenses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/14/5da43b05a310cf3e97a12b65.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
