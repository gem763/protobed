A news organization, agreeing to withhold the news.\n\nIn a statement to Vanity Fair, NBC calls the letter a \u201cmassive mischaracterization,\u201d and portrays Oppenheim as standing up to Weinstein\u2019s representatives. But the same week Harder sent that letter, Ronan has now revealed in Catch and Kill, Weinstein and Oppenheim shared a friendly email exchange. Weinstein, noting that they were on \u201copposite sides\u201d of the fence, congratulated him on the launch of Megyn Kelly\u2019s show. He also sent Oppenheim a bottle of Grey Goose.\n\n\u201cThanks, Harvey,\u201d Oppenheim responded, \u201cappreciate the well-wishes!\u201d\n\nTwo days later, I was informed that my AmFAR story had been killed.\n\nIn the past few days, faced with mounting outrage over their repeated lies about the Weinstein story and Lauer\u2019s misconduct, Lack and Oppenheim have once again resorted to attacking me and Ronan. In a statement to NBC staff, Lack accused Ronan of painting a \u201cfundamentally untrue picture\u201d in Catch and Kill. Oppenheim told the Times that the book \u201cwillfully distorts\u201d his exchanges with Ronan. And both continue to insist, over and over, that we did not have enough reporting to air the story\u2014without ever explaining why they didn\u2019t simply order us to keep pursuing what was clearly a promising and newsworthy investigation.\n\nMy last exchange with the network brass came in May 2018, when staffers in the investigative unit were summoned to a conference room for another meeting with Oppenheim. This time, he was accompanied by NBCUniversal\u2019s general counsel, Kimberley Harris, who reported on the company\u2019s internal investigation into the allegations against Lauer. She defended the decision to keep the review internal, rather than hiring an outside counsel, and insisted that NBC\u2019s investigation of itself was \u201cobjective\u201d\u2014a claim as ridiculous as it was sickening.\n\nOne of my colleagues pointed out that NBC\u2019s decision to avoid an independent review made it harder for us, as journalists, to do our jobs. \u201cIt feels like having an outside voice, whether they came to the same conclusions or not, would make it go away quicker,\u201d my colleague said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve just sort of elongated the process. It\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d\n\nHarris cut her off. \u201cIf the press would stop covering it,\u201d she said, \u201cit will go away.\u201d\n\nAnother colleague spoke up. \u201cBut we are the press!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harris, \u201cI\u2019m well aware.\u201d\n\nDid she honestly just say that? I thought to myself. This company doesn\u2019t want to get to the bottom of anything. They just want it to go away.\n\nAnother thought occurred to me. I raised my hand. \u201cHas NBC ever paid an employee who presented information on Matt to sign a nondisclosure agreement?\u201d I asked.\n\nHarris had been answering questions with long-winded and evasive answers, couched in legalese. But not now. She paused for a beat, looked at me, and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t appear to have been an outright lie\u2014but it was deeply misleading. We now know that as early as 2012, the network offered settlements to multiple women after they told colleagues they had been sexually harassed by Lauer. And the money was paid only after the women agreed to sign non-disclosure agreements. The network had protected itself and Matt Lauer with precisely the same legal tactics that Weinstein had used for years to cover up his sexual misconduct.\n\nThat August, I left NBC for a job as an executive producer for Al Gore\u2019s 24 Hours of Reality, a global broadcast focused on climate change. I decided it would be fitting to resign one year to the day that I had been ordered to stand down on the Weinstein story. I wrapped a final shoot in San Francisco, flew back to New York City, and cleaned out my desk.\n\nI left all of the interviews that Ronan and I had done during our Weinstein investigation in an unlocked drawer, for anyone to read or watch, should they too have a need to look for the truth.\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n\u2014 Impeachment fervor is causing a ruckus at Fox News\n\n\u2014 Why Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian adventure could end his career\n\n\u2014 Inside the stunning collapse of WeWork (and its kooky CEO)\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s official: Trump has met his Twitter match\n\n\u2014 A surprise appearance by Tiffany Trump\n\n\u2014 From the Archive: The power broker who taught Donald Trump the dark political arts\n\nLooking for more?
