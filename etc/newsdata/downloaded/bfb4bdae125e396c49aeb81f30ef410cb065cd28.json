You can find it in POLITICO's weekly print edition and online on Fridays.\n\nAt long last, this was the week when some people you've never heard of were questioned by a group of people you've also never heard of! Or, as we insist on calling them, commissioner hearings.\n\nThese hearings are regularly (OK, mainly by us) described as \"a grilling\" but they are for the most part way softer than that. In fact if these are grillings, you'd get food poisoning. On day one, for example, Mariya Gabriel, the nominee for the innovation and youth portfolio, was given hugs and asked to pose for selfies after she'd faced those tough MEPs! By the time they wrap up next week, we can no doubt look forward to seeing Frans Timmermans being carried shoulder-high around the hemicycle by whooping and hollering MEPs like some kind of bearded Dutch god (when I say look forward to...).\n\nThere are, however, small bits of grit in the oyster of commissioner hearings. The Polish nominee, Janusz Wojciechowski, flubbed it so badly that a call for applause by agriculture committee chair Norbert Lins at the end of the session was greeted with silence. Ouch.\n\nThen came the real drama: During Didier Reynders' hearing, the lights went off and Spanish MEP Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar said he'd \"never seen anything like it.\" It was only the lights flickering, Reynders didn't pull a shark out of his back pocket!\n\nFOX AND (NO) FRIENDS\n\nA senior Conservative MP was booted out of the party\u2019s conference in Manchester after he clashed with staff in a security row. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown \u201cremonstrated\u201d with a member of staff after he tried to bring somebody into a secure area for which they did not have the right pass. This ridiculous incident would never have happened if it wasn't for a bag of toy foxes. In 2008, Clifton-Brown was in China when he fell down a 20-foot concrete shaft. As luck would have it, he was carrying a huge bag of stuffed toy foxes (given to him by a Chinese firm) that he used to break his fall. Rumors that Clifton-Brown shouted \"for fox sake\" at Tory conference security staff could not be confirmed at the time of going to press.\n\nA BORDER WALL, AND MAKE IT SNAPPY!\n\nAccording to a new book, U.S. President Donald Trump talked about \u201cfortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators.\" He also reportedly suggested migrants be shot in the legs to slow them down. Describing a \"frenzied week of presidential rages,\" the book's authors say Trump shouted at White House staff: \"You are making me look like an idiot!\" Who's going to break it to him?\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\n\"That looks delicious. I'll slap a 17 percent tariff on it and grate it over my Fettuccine Alfredo.\"\n\nCan you do better?
