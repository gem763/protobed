Now, as one of the planet\u2019s most aged nations, with one in five citizens aged 70 or older, it is facing a sensitive problem: how do you keep traffic accidents down as people get older?\n\nIt\u2019s an important question: last year in Japan the proportion of fatal traffic accidents caused by drivers 75 or older rose to 14.8%, up from 8.7% in 2008. And although last year overall traffic deaths in Japan were the lowest since 1948, over-65s made up a record high of 56% of the total deaths that did occur.\n\nAccording to a Japanese government report in June, drivers 75 or older caused more than double the number of fatal accidents in 2018 than younger drivers did. More specifically, the over-75s caused 8.2 fatal crashes per every 100,000 on the road, \u201cabout 2.4 times the number caused by those aged 74 or younger\u201d.\n\nDeadly accidents involving older drivers continue to make national news. Right now in Japan, over-75s must take a cognitive test every three years before they can successfully get their licence renewed, and proposals over the summer aim to allow elders to only drive cars with advanced automatic braking systems.\n\nYet despite unilateral safety efforts, the biggest issue remains that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution to keeping elders driving safely. That\u2019s because not every human at the same age or life stage is going to be the same. \u201cYou can\u2019t say at X point in someone\u2019s chronological age, they are likely to experience specific declines,\u201d says Alana Officer, a disability and rehabilitation coordinator at the World Health Organization.\n\nPlus, some studies show that the youngest drivers are more dangerous than the eldest; that same Japanese government report from June found that drivers aged 16 to 19 were the most dangerous group, causing 11.1 fatal accidents per every 100,000 licenced drivers. What\u2019s more, the higher risk of elders dying in a car crash could also be due to increased age-related susceptibility to medical complications.\n\nOfficer says that if you have policy that is strictly tied to age \u2013 perhaps revoking licences for all people over a certain age in the name of public safety \u2013 you run the risk of ageist laws that discriminate.\n\nSo what can be done and what is Japan doing? The answers aren\u2019t clear cut, but a mix of mindful policy and new technologies may indicate a path for the future.", "description": "One of Earth's fastest ageing societies, Japan's grapple with a bigger population of elderly drivers might teach the rest of the world lessons about safety and inclusion.", "authors": ["Bryan Lufkin"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7s/2d/p07s2dbr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
