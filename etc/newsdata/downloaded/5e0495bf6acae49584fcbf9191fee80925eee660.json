The app is inexplicably still live on Google Play.\n\nSocial Club first launched on July 15, 2019, and during its life saw 455,000 downloads across both iOS and Android devices, according to data from Apptopia.\n\nThe app was part of a larger collaboration between Joshua Otten, the co-founder of cannabis lifestyle brand PR\u00d8HBTD and CEO of content services agency RONIN, and rapper and Cookies dispensaries owner, Berner. The founders announced in an August press release their plans for \u201cSocial Club TV,\u201d an over-the-top cannabis network featuring series about marijuana like \u201cMarijuana Mania,\u201d \u201cHighTech,\u201d \u201cPot Pie\u201d and others.\n\nThe Social Club mobile app, meanwhile, was designed to offer a home for cannabis content and, most importantly, marijuana-related advertising, to flourish outside of Instagram, where such content is currently banned.\n\nHowever, the Social Club app promoted itself not just as a place for sharing photos of cannabis, but rather a \u201czero-censorship community,\u201d which clearly invited abuse.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Berner, who was responding to NYT Styles reporter Taylor Lorenz\u2019s comments about the chaos raging in Social Club, the app had been \u201cattacked.\u201d\n\nI feel like we were attacked . I don\u2019t see how overnight the app completely changed , sad , scary and wack . Cleaning it up now \u2014 Berner (@berner415) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how overnight the app completely changed, sad, scary and wack,\u201d he said. \u201cCleaning it up now.\u201d\n\nBut the app wasn\u2019t so much attacked as it was poorly designed. There was seemingly no moderation or image recognition technology in place on Social Club, giving users a rare look at what it would be like if social media had no limitations or rules.\n\nAs designed, the app was also very much an Instagram clone, offering the ability to post photos, comment and browse a \u201cDiscover\u201d page to find interesting content.\n\nThere, you\u2019d come across a large number of marijuana photos, as intended, as well as pictures of cash, guns and other modified weapons, a wide range of other drugs (particularly pills), porn, memes and spam. Some of its content, like the child pornography, is illegal. And some of its users were openly selling drugs in the app, as well.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/faneta/status/1181205250021187585\n\nthings on social club\n\n1. porn\n\n2. weed\n\n3. sex\n\n4. marijuana\n\n5. sexual memes\n\n6. cannabis\n\n7. horny niggas expressing that they're horny\n\n8. drug dealers\n\n9. did i mention niggas are horny a lot\n\n10. potheads \u2014 im black but not proud (@wokeshart) October 7, 2019\n\nEveryone else: OMG EW CHILD PORN IN SOCIAL CLUB OMG WEED THIS APP IS DISGUSTING #BANSOCIALUB\n\nThe shit i find in social club: pic.twitter.com/rdI6qepoGT \u2014 .78cm gang (@ceoofhorny) October 8, 2019\n\nSocial Club just Instagram with Porn \u2014 IG: @duragcarti (@DuragCarti) October 6, 2019\n\nif social club is just insta without censors im gonna post so much fucking porn there \u2014 ELEPHANT BONES (@hullowaan) October 5, 2019\n\nWhen the servers are back up for Social Club and you can get back to looking at porn and memes pic.twitter.com/JdaNjoYFxC \u2014 hoodniggademiks (@hoodniggademiks) October 6, 2019\n\nSocial Club is literally the shittest Instagram clone that\u2019s filled with porn, weed and shit memes and I love it \u2014 Awkwerd is fat (@ImAwkwerd) October 7, 2019\n\ni love social club its just drugs porn gore and anime \u2014 pee (@doorheaded) October 8, 2019\n\nSince its launch, Social Club soared up the charts on the App Store, becoming the No. 12 top-ranked app on the U.S. App Store across both apps and games, and the No. 5 top-ranked app. Social Club isn\u2019t as popular on Google Play, where it\u2019s the No. 70 top app and No. 132 overall.\n\nAccording to an Instagram story post by Berner, Social Club is now \u201ctemporarily\u201d off the App Store because \u201ca weirdass porn community attacked the app.\u201d He said the app is adding an image recognition system to help it identify and remove the problematic content, including the numerous photos of pills being posted for sale.\n\nHe also shot down rumors that Social Club \u201cwas working with the feds\u201d and warned people (using a lot of expletives) that it was really stupid to be posting drugs for sale on social media using your phone in the first place. That being said, he promised Social Club wouldn\u2019t look at its users DMs.\n\nApple and Google haven\u2019t commented.", "description": "Apple has booted from the App Store cannabis-promoting app Social Club after it devolved into a place where users were openly posting drugs for sale, and it became filled with photos of various drugs, guns and weaponry, racist content, memes, gore videos and adult and child pornography, according to its users.
