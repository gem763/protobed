Johnson found out I was in D.C., and staff called me and wanted to do a meeting with me. So I reached out back and said, \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll come down the Hill and talk to you,\u2019 \u201d the former diplomat told the Post.\n\nThe conversation comes amid questions over whether U.S. military aid to Ukraine was held up over the president's requests for Ukraine to open criminal investigations into Biden and allegations of interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nJohnson previously told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he was made aware by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union (EU), of an agreement in which Ukraine would appoint a prosecutor to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened in 2016\" in exchange for the U.S. releasing military spending, a plan Johnson said at the time he opposed.\n\n\u201cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u201d the senator told the Journal earlier this month. \u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God.
