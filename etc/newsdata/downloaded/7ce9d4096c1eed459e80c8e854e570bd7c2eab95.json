It may be that the cheap end is cheap for a reason, but it could be that expensive is just overpriced in its own right. The valuation of the US market against other regions has fundamental merit given the predominance of higher quality companies in the US, but it remains a question of degree and it is notable that the performance of some regional markets have picked up in the past year.\n\nIt would be a brave investor to switch out of a portfolio that has delivered exceptional returns for the past decade. Yet investing is often an uncomfortable process. To make a case for a change in equity holdings requires a catalyst of fundamental rationale. The trigger could be a reduction in equity allocations. Given how favoured the growth names are, they are likely to be the first point of call in a selling phase.\n\nThe concept of crowded trades in investment markets is a topic that is not obvious to the naked eye. After all, every stock is held by some investor. But what you don\u2019t see is who are the holders, the size of their positions, where the stock fits into the current market themes or its valuation. History shows that in market sell-offs, these stocks fall first and most. They are also inevitably the most susceptible in reacting to an issue that causes investors to rush into realising positions. Add in hedge funds to this mix \u2013 a rich source of volatility given their leveraged portfolios.\n\nLet's return to the property comparison. If the view is that prices are falling, it is likely that those held for similar purposes and intentions fall the most. By way of example, the huge run in Perth properties came to an abrupt end as the mining boom faded. Few thought it would happen until it did. Now Hobart is experiencing some of the strongest growth in values. Who would have thought would be the case three years ago?\n\nEventually value in equities does play out. It suggests that fund strategies with a GARP (\"growth at a reasonable price\") style are the core part of a portfolio. They will not always compare well against the index in all conditions yet rarely lose touch entirely. Strategies with a singular growth or value orientation can have stellar performance periods, but for them it\u2019s a question of whether one knows when to call the end to their cycle.\n\nGiselle Roux is an investment strategist.", "description": "Given how favoured the growth names are, they are likely to be the first point of call in a selling phase.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4682%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/341ad917267be35125d958721823d6f4c5a8bdf4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
