Threatening legal action, the report alleges that senior Ustwo programmer Austin Kelmore - also the branch chair and founding member of the union\u2019s Game Workers Unite branch - suffered \u201cvictimisation\u201d and \u201cunfair dismissal\u201d because of his union actions.\n\nUstwo denied these allegations in a statement this morning, which several current employees retweeted.\n\nUstwo Games is a mobile game studio based in London. Recently, the team released Apple Arcade game Assemble With Care, which Kotaku described as a \u201cmelancholy adventure in stuff repair.\u201d Kelmore, a main programmer on that game, has been extremely active with Game Workers Unite, a labour initiative advocating for better working conditions in the games industry. (Game Workers Unite UK is a branch of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain.)\n\nAccording to the report from IWGB, Ustwo\u2019s human resources department took issue with Kelmore\u2019s focus on \u201ccompany feedback, diversity schemes and working practices,\u201d reads a cited email from Ustwo HR in October 2018. The email also claimed that \u201cIt feels that Austin is a self-appointed bastion of change and sometimes speaks on behalf of others.\u201d A senior manager questioned Kelmore about his union activities, according to the report, which also criticises Ustwo for not giving Kelmore access to a union rep in a disciplinary meeting.\n\nA union rep reached out to clarify that Kelmore did not have access to a union rep, as is his legal right, because he did not know the initial meeting was disciplinary in nature. Kelmore was subsequently put on \u201cgardening leave,\u201d the UK\u2019s term for a notice period pending dismissal.\n\nA statement from GWU UK secretary Jamie Cross reads:\n\n\u201cDespite Ustwo\u2019s claims of being as much a family as it is a company, it has decided to leave Austin, one of its best developers, completely orphaned. Austin and his family are not only left without their main source of income, but also unsure if they will have to uproot their whole lives and leave the country in a few weeks. The union will not stand idly by in the face of this unlawful and vicious act, and is determined to fight back until this decision is reversed, either voluntarily or through the courts.\u201d\n\nReached over Twitter direct messages, Kelmore declined to comment for this article.\n\nUstwo claims that Kelmore was dismissed \u201cfor reasons unconnected to his membership of a trade union or his undertaking of trade union activities\u201d in a statement posted to Twitter this morning. Ustwo says that they have other union-affiliated employees, adding that the IWGB\u2019s statement contained \u201cinaccuracies and omissions . . . which are misleading.\u201d Retweeting the statement, Assemble With Care lead developer Matt Newcombe said, \u201cIt breaks my heart to see the reaction given to a misconstrued situation that people are only hearing one side of, it does not reflect the reality.\u201d\n\nA representative from Ustwo told Kotaku Australia over email:\n\nAustin Kelmore will be leaving Ustwo Games in the near future for reasons unconnected to his membership of a trade union or his undertaking trade union activities. We have other employees who are members of trade unions and we respect the right of our employees to unionise. There are inaccuracies and omissions in what has been stated by IWGB which are misleading. However, to respect our employees\u2019 privacy it is not appropriate for us to comment further on this matter.\n\nReached over the phone, an IWGB representative told Kotaku that Ustwo\u2019s statement is \u201cobviously ridiculous. What we said was completely true, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have said it.\u201d They pointed out that Ustwo didn\u2019t say what specifically was inaccurate or omitted. When Kotaku asked whether IWGB had any bias toward Kelmore\u2019s account, as he\u2019s a GWU UK founding member, the representative said that that fact \u201cmakes his dismissal more egregious.\u201d The representative would not share where the information in the IWGB\u2019s report was sourced from. (Kotaku has reached out to several employees in hopes of verifying the account.)\n\nThe union has given Ustwo until October 4 (UK time) to take back their decision before they initiate legal proceedings.", "description": "The UK\u2019s Independent Workers Union accused Monument Valley and Assemble With Care studio Ustwo Games of \u201cunion-busting\u201d in a statement today.
