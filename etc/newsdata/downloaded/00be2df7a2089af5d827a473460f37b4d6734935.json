Steak Fry in Iowa Saturday:\n\n.@AndrewYang two days ago: We need to increase the cost of beef so people stop eating it.@AndrewYang today: pic.twitter.com/QVNpolIxWj \u2014 Eric Spencer (@JustEric) September 21, 2019\n\n.@AndrewYang seemed to really enjoy flipping steaks earlier pic.twitter.com/GjAdthW3Ry \u2014 Iowa Starting Line (@IAStartingLine) September 21, 2019\n\nWell, he\u2019s one of the lucky ones who can afford to flip a steak now and then.\n\nIn any case, Yang\u2019s campaign shot off a pretty libertarian tweet Saturday:\n\nGenerally speaking, people should be free to do what they want. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 21, 2019\n\nNot that we disagree, but he did tweet one of those \u201cgenerally speaking\u201d qualifiers a day before:\n\nAs a parent of young kids I believe rampant access to pornography is a real problem. We need to empower families to be able to moderate what our kids see and when. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 20, 2019\n\nSo generally speaking, people should be free to do what they want \u2026\n\nExcept eat hamburgers or drive their own cars. https://t.co/7J9pskYYyD \u2014 Varad Mehta (@varadmehta) September 21, 2019\n\nYeah, President Yang isn\u2019t going to implement a \u201cmandatory buyback\u201d of your old gas-guzzling \u201cclunker,\u201d but he insists you will really enjoy your new electric car.\n\nHow do you define generally speaking? \u2014 Jake DeVries (@kindapinkJake) September 21, 2019\n\nYea, but doesn't this fly in the face of 80% of your positions? \u2014 Human Affairs (@AffairsHuman) September 21, 2019\n\n\u2026\u2026Are you being serious right now ? \u2014 Kimberley Huntington (@KimberleyHunti1) September 21, 2019\n\nLike watch porn??

You know. Stuff like that. \u2014 [email protected] (@XwingAtAlicious) September 21, 2019\n\nExcept eat beef? \u2014 yannispappas (@yannispappas) September 21, 2019\n\nHow about eating meat that hasn\u2019t had prices artificially inflated by burdensome government taxation ? \u2014 Joshua Byrd (@CaviarEmptier) September 21, 2019\n\nIncluding eating red meat without paying a massive premium that would hurt poor and working class people? I\u2019ve found you to be an interesting and out of the box thinker, but your comments on meat consumption lost me. \u2014 Kathleen (@Calibamawife) September 21, 2019\n\nExactly. Including keeping their own healthcare, right? \u2014 B (@BAC360) September 21, 2019\n\nExcept\u2026own cars, eat hamburgers and watch porn, right? \u2014 Jessie Lynn \u271d\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc3b (@LivingLifeVT) September 21, 2019\n\nUnless they wanna eat a burger or buy an AR-15 or watch porn. \u2014 Buried Bump Stock (@RichardMilhousN) September 21, 2019\n\nExcept own guns or keep their own money, right?\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d \u2014 RandomCat (@RandomC90238534) September 21, 2019\n\nThen get your hands off my steaks and guns \u2014 NarcissisticNarwhal (@NecroticNewt) September 21, 2019\n\nApply this to taxes. \u2014 Sean P.

You'd be a good Libertarian if it wasn't for this one small snag. \u2014 The Green Pilot (@ZippedGreene17) September 21, 2019\n\nWhat if I don't want to pay for a massive, wasteful government? \u2014 Hacker Holdings LLC (@HoldMyGlencairn) September 21, 2019\n\nEh.

This is rather uncontroversial outside the Democratic Party. \u2014 Mark Culham \ud83c\udf10 (@mdculham) September 21, 2019\n\n..Without being unfairly taxed for every day activities like driving a car or buying milk? Imagine if you decided to be the only Democratic guy against all that control freak stuff. A pro freedom, sane one. The younger one with all his faculties still in order. You could be. \u2014 Rachel \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RaychelTania) September 21, 2019\n\nYou favor a value-added tax and a carbon tax so I'm not free to do what I want with my $$$\n\nYou want to make private sector workers slaves to the govt's insatiable budget\n\nNo pic.twitter.com/azDgHjMHdW \u2014 #LearnToCode (@LearnTo73637432) September 21, 2019\n\nPoliticians and their evergreen lies \u2014 JBC (@AllAlongCross) September 21, 2019\n\nYou had me till you got on board with the leftist talking points, and now you\u2019re sprinkling some libertarian in there, and that\u2019s cool but I\u2019m out brah\u2026 \u2014 RJ Dearinger (@rjdearinger) September 21, 2019\n\nYou mean, people should be free to do what you want. \u2014 Woofle Jelly (@huntsvut) September 21, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "From what we've heard from Andrew Yang, that \"generally speaking\" disclaimer is going to be huge.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/andrew-yang-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
