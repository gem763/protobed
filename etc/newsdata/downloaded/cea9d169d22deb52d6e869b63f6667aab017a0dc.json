The future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriot...the future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique,\" Trump said. \"If you want freedom, take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty. If you want peace, love your nation.\"\n\nIn that theme, he went after human trafficking networks and slammed open border advocacy groups as \"evil\" for emboldening their criminality.\n\n\"I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just, your policies are cruel and evil,\" he said. \u201cYou are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women and children. You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives and well-being of countless innocent people. When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\"\n\n\u201cMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe, and unsustainable for everyone involved. The sending countries and the depleted countries, and they\u2019ve become depleted very fast, their youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste. The receiving countries are overburdened with more migrants than they can responsibly accept and the migrants themselves are exploited, assaulted and abused by vicious coyotes. Nearly one third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way,\u201d he continued.\n\nTrump went directly after China for stealing intellectual property and then banning companies from operating in their markets. He also criticized the government for its infringement on the sovereignty of Hong Kong and their crackdown on freedom protesters.\n\n\"Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests. But as far as America is concerned, those days are over,\" he continued.\n\n\"The American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China...But as I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people.\" - President @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/LZJNfO7Qby \u2014 Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThen, with the world watching closely, he went after Iran and warned the regime if their current behavior continues, additional pressure will be added.\n\n\"All nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran's blood lust. As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened,\" he said.\n\nMonday night the UK, France and Germany issued a joint statement holding Iran accountable for the recent attack on Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe President will host a series of meetings Tuesday afternoon with world and UN leaders before returning to Trump Tower tonight.\n\n\u201cLove of our own nations makes the world better for all nations. So to all the leaders here today: join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make: Lift up your nations. Cherish your cultures. Honor your histories. Treasure your citizens. Make your countries strong, and prosperous, and righteous,\" he said. \"Honor the dignity of your people, and nothing will be outside of your reach. When our nations are greater, the future will be brighter. Our people will be happier. And our partnerships will be stronger.\u201d", "description": ".09/25/2019 0:35:25AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/04609b62-a977-4989-aa1a-9660ff208bd1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
