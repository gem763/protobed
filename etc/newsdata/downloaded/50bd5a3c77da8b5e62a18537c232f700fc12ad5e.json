And because a Chromebook may have more than one user, it needs to have more than one login, so that each user has access to their own personal apps and content.\n\nAdding a new user to a Chromebook is not difficult. Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\nClick on the button in the lower right corner (the one that shows the time, battery life, etc.).\n\nClick on \u201cSign out\u201d at the top of the pop-up window.\n\nYou\u2019ll be brought back to the sign-in screen. At the bottom left of the screen, click on the button labeled \u201cAdd Person.\u201d\n\nHave the new user sign in using their Google account (or they can create a new account if they don\u2019t have one).\n\nThe account\u2019s bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings will be synced to the new machine. If you want to change any of those options, check the box that reads \u201cReview sync options following setup.\u201d Then press \u201cAccept and continue.\u201d\n\nOkay, here comes the Google Play terms of service. Go ahead and read them if you want, and then approve them.\n\nThere is a check box that allows all your data to be backed up to Google Drive. If you don\u2019t want that to happen, uncheck the box. You will also be asked if you want to allow the system to use your location (you can uncheck that box as well) and if you want to review your Google Play options after setup.\n\nFinished? Then click on \u201cAccept.\u201d\n\nAt this point, you will be asked if you want to connect the Chromebook to your phone so that you can share your internet connection with the computer (this is only available with specific phones and Chromebooks), text from your computer, and use your phone to unlock the Chromebook. You can click on \u201cAccept and continue\u201d if you want to do this, or click on \u201cNo thanks\u201d if you\u2019d rather not deal with it at this point.\n\nGrid View Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAnd you\u2019re done! Now, when you click on the sign-on screen, you\u2019ll see two names. Each user will have their separate account, and won\u2019t have access to the other.\n\nIf you\u2019re no longer sharing the Chromebook, you can easily remove a user:\n\nSign out of your account so that you\u2019re brought back to the sign-on screen.\n\nClick on the downward-facing arrow next to the name of the person you want to take off the computer.\n\nClick on \u201cRemove this user.\u201d You\u2019ll be reminded that everything associated with that account, including files and local data, will be deleted.\n\nGrid View Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nPhoto by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nKeep in mind that, while you can easily remove any additional users that were added to a system from the main sign-on screen, you cannot remove the \u201cowner\u201d of the Chromebook (the first person to create an account on it) without completely resetting the system.\n\nIf you want to allow somebody to use your Chromebook just for a few hours rather than for a longer period of time, it\u2019s probably easier to simply have them sign in as a guest:\n\nSign out of your account so that you\u2019re back on the sign-on screen.\n\nClick on the \u201cBrowse as Guest\u201d button in the lower left corner of the screen.\n\nTo exit guest mode, click on the time button in the lower right corner of the screen, and then click on \u201cExit guest.\u201d\n\nWhen you\u2019re in guest mode, you can browse, use Bluetooth, adjust the font size, etc., but you can\u2019t save anything to the computer, and when you\u2019re done, according to Google, your files, cookies, website data, and browsing activity will be automatically deleted.", "description": "Because a Chromebook may have more than one user, it needs to have more than one login, so that each user has access to their own personal apps and content.
