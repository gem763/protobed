Although the Times did not name the whistleblower, the paper\u2019s critics accused the article of doing great harm to him and his career by supplying the sort of details that would eventually lead to his unmasking.\n\n\u201cAstonishing for the NYT to essentially out the whistleblower in a story that doesn\u2019t advance what we already knew on the same day the President threatened retribution,\u201d wrote former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes. \u201cIt\u2019s time to replace Dean Baquet,\u201d wrote think-tanker Norm Ornstein in a vote of no-confidence for the paper\u2019s executive editor. \u201cI cannot think of a good reason for the Times to publish information about the whistleblower\u2019s identity,\u201d offered Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp. \u201cWow, at face value this seems wrong,\u201d tut-tutted the Atlantic\u2019s James Fallows.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWithout a doubt, the Times story has complicated the CIA whistleblower\u2019s life by poking holes in the cloak of anonymity he used to shroud himself from exposure. But if he\u2019s as seasoned as the Times sketch makes him out to be, he had to know that the contents and style of his official complaint to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general would draw arrows directly to him and eventually puncture his anonymity. As the Times piece points out, the language of his complaint revealed him as someone \u201csteeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.\u201d It was never going to take much sleuthing by the White House to ferret him out.\n\nBrookings Institute senior fellow Tom Wright, who criticized the Times for making its disclosure, made this point in a Thursday afternoon tweet. \u201cRumors that the whistleblower was an IC officer detailed to the NSC were circulating widely yesterday [Wednesday]. I still think they should not have published it, but I doubt it was news to Trump and his associates,\u201d Wright wrote. Evidence that the whistleblower was hiding in plain sight came a few hours after the Times story went online, as the Wall Street Journal confirmed its salient details.\n\nEven if the discovery hadn\u2019t been inevitable, the Times (and the Journal) would have been justified in blowing the whistleblower\u2019s cover. It\u2019s not the job of the press to protect the identities of official whistleblowers who prefer anonymity. Journalists can\u2014and do\u2014offer anonymity to all sorts of sources. But nowhere is it written that just because an official tipster desires anonymity, a reporter is obligated to mask him from sight. Anonymity is generally granted to sources by reporters as a transactional good in exchange for information. In the absence of a negotiation, a reporter has no automatic obligation to keep a whistleblower\u2019s identity secret, no matter how noble his motives. The only special protections that can be rightfully claimed by government whistleblowers are the legal protections that prohibit government retaliation against them.\n\nNor is it the duty of the press to suppress news\u2014that\u2019s how the press works in authoritarian societies. No matter where you stand on the Times\u2019 decision to publish, you\u2019ve got to admit that a story about a CIA officer documenting criminal wrongdoing by the president is big news. Writing in the Times of London in 1852, John Thadeus Delane put it best: \u201cThe duty of the press is to obtain the earliest and most correct intelligence of the events of the time, and instantly, by disclosing them, to make them the common property of the nation.\u201d\n\nFormer CIA analyst Nada Bakos and others knocked the Times because, they said, its story would deter future whistleblowers from calling out wrongdoing. That might prove to be true, but I doubt it. Whistleblowers aren\u2019t babes in the wood. They know from observation that whistleblower programs don\u2019t work like witness protection programs that whisk tell-tales away to some new life. Most of them understand the risks and draw on motivations to do the right thing that the rest of us can only imagine. They\u2019d rather make a sacrifice than allow injustice to continue.\n\nThe counterargument can be made\u2014and I\u2019ll make it!\u2014that the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have done the whistleblower and the country a service with their aggressive coverage of the Ukraine affair. Thanks to the incessant noise of the nosy parkers of the press, an unspeakable scandal has been thrust to center stage where the president can\u2019t hide from it.\n\nIsn\u2019t that the dream of every whistleblower?\n\n******\n\nI don\u2019t recall the same outrage accompanying the slew of attempts made in 2018 to expose \u201cAnonymous,\u201d the Trump official who wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about his efforts to monkeywrench the White House.
