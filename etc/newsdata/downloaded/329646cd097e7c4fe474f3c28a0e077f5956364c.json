Jeff Overs/BBC/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThe mechanism, set out in London\u2019s latest Brexit proposals, aims to resolve the biggest sticking point in negotiations: the currently seamless border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\n\n\u201cThe key issue is the principle of consent, that\u2019s why the backstop was rejected three times, that was the concern in terms of both sides in Northern Ireland not approving of the backstop,\u201d Stephen Barclay told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo the key is the principle of consent, now of course in the mechanism, as part of the intensive negotiations we could look at that and discuss that.\u201d\n\nThe 500-km (300-mile) border will be the United Kingdom\u2019s only land frontier with the bloc after it leaves.\n\nThe problem is how to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a \u201cback door\u201d into the EU\u2019s single market and customs union without erecting border controls that could undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of political and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland in which more than 3,600 people were killed.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he cannot accept the so-called backstop arrangement included in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with the EU by his predecessor Theresa May, which British lawmakers rejected three times.\n\nHe made what he called a final Brexit offer to the European Union on Wednesday that centres on replacing the backstop with a proposal for an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods.\n\nThe proposal also says the legislative assembly in Northern Ireland \u2014 which has been suspended since 2017 \u2014 would have the right to decide every four years whether it wants to continue to abide by EU rules on traded goods.\n\nThe European Union and Ireland, however, said the proposals were unlikely to result in a deal without more concessions.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he did not fully understand how the British proposals might work and that Dublin could not sign up to a treaty that did not safeguard an open Irish-British border.\n\nHis deputy, Simon Coveney, said giving the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote on single market alignment would in effect give a veto to any one party.\n\nHe also raised concerns about the proposed customs arrangements that would require checks and controls even if, as proposed, they do not take place at or near the border.\n\nBarclay said Britain was willing to discuss the detail of customs proposals, adding: \u201cWe have set out a broad landing zone, in the detail of the negotiations, of course we can get into the details of how operationally they work, what legal certainty is required.\u201d\n\nNO DITHER\n\nWriting in the Sun on Sunday newspaper, Johnson said the proposals were a \u201cpractical compromise that gives ground where necessary while still protecting the UK\u2019s interests and the Brexit this country voted for\u201d.\n\nHe said lawmakers from every wing of his Conservative Party, from his allies in Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP and even from the opposition Labour Party had said they could get behind the deal.\n\n\u201cAnd I salute the spirit of compromise from MPs on all sides who have looked at what\u2019s on the table, reflected on what\u2019s best for their constituents, and decided they are willing to put aside their personal beliefs and back the deal that they know will get Brexit done,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the Oct. 31 deadline approaching, Johnson has consistently said he will not ask for another delay to Brexit, but also that he will not break a law that forces him to request one if no withdrawal deal has been agreed by Oct. 19. He has not explained the apparent contradiction in his comments.\n\nJohnson discussed his proposals with French President Emmanuel Macron and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa on Sunday.\n\nHe urged Macron to \u201cpush forward\u201d to secure a deal and said the EU should not be lured into the mistaken belief that the UK would stay in the EU after Oct.31, Number 10 said.\n\nMacron told Johnson that talks should continue swiftly with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s team in the coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles, according to an Elysee official.\n\nJohnson said in the Sun on Sunday that Britain could do a deal if the EU was willing.\n\n\u201cBut they should be under no illusions or misapprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no more dither or delay. On Oct. 31 we are going to get Brexit done.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nA senior source in Johnson\u2019s office said on Sunday there was a chance to get a deal done: a deal that is backed by lawmakers and a deal which involves compromise on all sides.\n\n\u201cThe UK has made a big, important offer but it\u2019s time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too,\u201d the source said. \u201cIf not the UK will leave with no deal.\u201d\n\nThe government acknowledged for the first time on Friday that Johnson will send a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay if no divorce deal has been reached.", "description": "Britain is open to some flexibility on the proposed mechanism that would allow lawmakers in post-Brexit Northern Ireland to decide whether the British province remains in regulatory alignment with the European Union, its Brexit minister said.", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437839051&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950PH", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
