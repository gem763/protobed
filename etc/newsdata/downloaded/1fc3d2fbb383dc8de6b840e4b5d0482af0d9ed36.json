USA TODAY\n\nAnd so it is finally set. That little meeting we\u2019ve all been awaiting remains two weeks off. But Alabama and LSU are safely headed toward a showdown of unbeatens in Tuscaloosa.\n\nWhich only means the run-up will be filled with so much hype, you cannot even imagine. Oh, and also that there will be much talk about \"what if.\" As in: What if Alabama/LSU loses a close game, then wins out \u2013 would that team still get into the Playoff?\n\n(But if we\u2019re going to play that game, Ohio State and Penn State play Nov. 23; if they're both still unbeaten going in, why not two Big Ten East teams in the Football Four? The answer, from parts down South: \u201cSEC! SEC! SEC!\u201d)\n\nIt remains unlikely. But the idea picked up steam with the pratfall by Oklahoma, which lost at Kansas State. The only good news on a very bad day for the Sooners: a fourth-quarter comeback prevented a blowout, which would probably have ended their hopes. As it is? They\u2019re waaaaaay outside the Football Four bracket \u2013 and the SEC\u2019s dream of two teams inside it is a little less improbable.\n\nWeek 9 observations: Writing off Oklahoma as College Football Playoff contender ridiculous\n\nWinners and losers: Oklahoma, Ohio State lead way in Week 9\n\nBut wait, what\u2019s that out West? Oregon and Utah are in the race, too. November could be a lot of fun, all over. As always, remember we pick the bracket as if the season was over today.*\n\nFootball Four\n\n1. Ohio State \u2013 We keep saying it, but they keep proving it. After the Buckeyes turned a supposed showdown with Wisconsin into a laugher, here goes again: This is the nation\u2019s most complete team. JK Dobbins, Justin Fields \u2013 the offense is terrific \u2013 but pay special attention to the unblockable Chase Young, who is the chief wrecking ball for a very fast, very mean defense.\n\n2. LSU \u2013 Finally, someone slowed down the Tigers\u2019 offense. But LSU\u2019s defense \u2013 which let\u2019s be honest, has been an issue \u2013 was very good in beating Auburn. Now we get two weeks of hype before a trip to Tuscaloosa.\n\n3. Alabama \u2013 No Tua? No trouble \u2013 at least not against Arkansas, which wasn\u2019t even a speedbump for \u2018Bama. Now we get two weeks of hype before LSU \u2013 and all sorts of worrying about whether Tagovailoa will be full-speed on that surgically repaired ankle.\n\nAlabama wide receiver Henry Ruggs III celebrates after scoring a touchdown against Arkansas. (Photo: Butch Dill, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n4. Clemson \u2013 Welcome back, Tigers, to the Football Four. Like we kept saying, you just need to win. And in the ACC, this seems pretty likely. The latest victim was Boston College.\n\nFour More**\n\n5. Penn State \u2013 The Nittany Lions are good, and they\u2019re unbeaten, and after swamping Michigan State, they look very much like a legitimate Football Four contender. Can Penn State keep rolling to set up a showdown Nov. 23 in Columbus, Ohio? Stay tuned.\n\n6. Oregon \u2013 It took a last-minute drive and a field goal by a freshman kicker as time expired to get past Washington State. But the Ducks (and the Pac-12, too) are very much alive in the Football Four chase.\n\n7. Georgia \u2013 The Bulldogs\u2019 path is simple, but there\u2019s likely just one: Win out. Up next: Florida in Jacksonville, Fla., where the winner remains alive and the loser is finished. It didn\u2019t help that South Carolina got pasted by Tennessee.\n\n8. Florida \u2013 The Gators\u2019 path is the same as their rival\u2019s: Win \u2018em all. The annual neutral-site matchup will be a Top 10 showdown and a Football Four eliminator, all at once.\n\nA Few More After That***\n\nUtah \u2013 The other one-loss Pac-12 team, Utah does not control its destiny in the Pac-12 South (that\u2019s USC, with the head-to-head result against the Utes). But fueled by one of the nation\u2019s best defensive fronts, Utah has a shot at the Football Four.\n\nOklahoma \u2013 The Sooners\u2019 Football Four hopes are on life support, but there remains a faint pulse. The bigger problem: What about that performance against Kansas State inspires confidence in Oklahoma running the table?\n\nMinnesota \u2013 Are the Gophers for real? We still don\u2019t know, but after blowing out Maryland they\u2019re 8-0.\n\nBaylor \u2013 Are the Bears for real? We still don\u2019t know, but after taking the weekend off, they\u2019re the Big 12\u2019s last unbeaten.\n\nFutile Four****\n\nNotre Dame \u2013 After that loss at Georgia, the path into the Football Four was very narrow and highly unlikely. But after a miserable performance in even more miserable weather in Ann Arbor, we can go ahead and take the Irish out of the picture.\n\nTexas \u2013 Is back \u2026 to mediocrity. A loss at TCU was the Longhorns\u2019 third, and suddenly it seems a lot harder to find a way into the Big 12 championship game \u2013 but why would anyone suspect these guys would get there? Sam Ehlinger (four interceptions!) wasn\u2019t Superman, and the defense wasn\u2019t good (again), and Texas is not back.\n\nNebraska \u2013 The Huskers had already discovered that the offseason hype was, uh, overblown. But a home loss to Indiana will reinforce the reality: Nebraska remains a long, long way from where the Cornhuskers thought they were headed. It\u2019s very likely more losses loom.\n\nMichigan State \u2013 The Spartans are riding an ugly three-game losing streak. The losses to Ohio State, Wisconsin and now Penn State came by a combined score of 100-17.\n\n* The season is not over today.\n\n** Don\u2019t be worried that your team sits just outside the cut. This is a weekly snapshot. And what do we know, anyway?\n\n*** See the previous note, but it\u2019s OK to be slightly concerned or very angry. But what do we know, anyway?\n\n**** No note necessary.", "description": "As Ohio State rolls and Oklahoma falls, the SEC dreams of getting two teams into College Football Playoff.
