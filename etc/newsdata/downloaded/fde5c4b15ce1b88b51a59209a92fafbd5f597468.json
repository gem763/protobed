However, imagine yourself on a French mountainside and it is that thoroughly irresistible pain perdu that probably gave the US its inspiration. For our British issue, I\u2019ve made a version with new-season squashes, which are all over farmers\u2019 markets right now. The squash gives the caramel a wonderful flavour and tames its sweetness.\n\nFrench toast with salted caramel pumpkin puree\n\nThe sweet-savoury flavour of pumpkin softens the dark, salted caramel and gives it a gorgeous deep shade of tangerine.\n\nPrep 30 min\n\nCook 45 min\n\nServes 4-6\n\n\u00bd small pumpkin or squash\n\n200g caster sugar\n\n50g butter\n\n100ml double cream\n\n3-4 tbsp dark rum or aged tequila\n\n\u00bd lemon\n\nSalt\n\nFor the french toast\n\n4 eggs\n\n175ml whole milk\n\n6 slices white bread\n\n75g butter\n\nVanilla ice-cream, cream or yoghurt, to serve\n\nPeel and cut the squash into equal 3-5cm chunks. Put in a steamer and cook for about 25 minutes, until tender to the point of a sharp knife. Remove the pan from heat and leave the squash uncovered to steam-dry.\n\nTo make the caramel, put the sugar in a heavy-based pan and pour over four tablespoons of water. Set over a medium heat and keep an eye on it as the sugar melts and turns a deep, dark caramel colour, and the water evaporates. Just before it starts smoking, quickly add the butter, cream and rum, and stir vigorously until you have a smooth, silky caramel.\n\nPut 350g squash flesh into a bowl, pour over the caramel and . Use a stick blender to whizz until you have a smooth sauce. Taste, season with a little lemon juice and a few pinches of salt, and keep warm.\n\nTo make the french toast, whisk together the eggs and milk, submerge the bread in the mix and leave for 10-15 minutes.\n\nHeat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add one to two tablespoons of the butter and, once hot, fry one to two slices of the bread at a time, turning once the bottom is golden \u2013 three to four minutes. Set aside on a warm plate and repeat until all the toast is done. Dollop over scoops of the pumpkin caramel, season with a scrunch of sea salt, then serve with vanilla ice-cream, thick cream or Greek yoghurt.\n\nAnd for the rest of the week\n\nThere is usually some leftover puree, so stir it through Greek yoghurt for breakfast with a touch of granola. Leftover pumpkin is delicious in a fiery Thai curry, and would make a lovely autumnal soup.", "description": "A British version of pain perdu using seasonal British squashes \u2013 but it\u2019s still French toast at heart", "authors": ["Thomasina Miers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7728bb8d94eb97b8bbd98d942166fb701f0367d/432_86_7066_4239/master/7066.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f38612a3955d49881557bfe95989ebe", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
