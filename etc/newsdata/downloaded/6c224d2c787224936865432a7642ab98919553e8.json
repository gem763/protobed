In the ninth, the Cardinals blew it open against Braves closer Mark Melancon.\n\nDexter Fowler and Tommy Edman singled before Goldschmidt walked on four pitches to load the bases with one out. Melancon got ahead of Ozuna with two quick strikes, only to give up a liner just inside the third-base bag that put St. Louis ahead for the first time.\n\nWong finished off Melancon with another two-run double, this one down the right-field line.\n\n\u201cI loved our at-bats all night,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cI love Marcell\u2019s at-bats. Just calm, letting the game come to him.\u201d\n\nThe Braves didn\u2019t go quietly in their half.\n\nRonald Acu\u00f1a Jr. hit a two-run homer off Carlos Martinez, and Freddie Freeman added a solo shot. But Martinez got the final two outs to claim a shaky win and put the Cardinals head in the best-of-five series going into Game 2 Friday. Jack Flaherty starts for the Cardinals against Mike Foltynewicz.\n\nIt was a familiar scenario for the Braves, who have lost nine straight postseason series and are just one away from tying the Chicago Cubs\u2019 record for postseason futility _ 10 straight playoff losses. Atlanta has not won a postseason series since 2001, and hasn\u2019t even led a series since going up 2-1 on San Francisco in the 2002 NLDS. The Giants won the next two games to advance.\n\nThe Braves snapped a 1-1 tie in the sixth when Dansby Swanson slashed a one-hopper that bounced off the chest of third baseman Edman. The ball deflected to shortstop Paul DeJong, who had a chance to get a force at second base for the third out. But the throw to Wong was a bouncer, the ball shooting off his glove to allow a second run to score on the play.\n\nBoth Edman and DeJong were charged with errors initially, which would have been the Cardinals\u2019 first three-error game of the season. The official scorer changed his ruling, giving Swanson a hit on his wicked shot.\n\nWong also messed up an attempted backhanded toss for an error in the first, helping the Braves grab a 1-0 lead.\n\nIt was totally uncharacteristic for a Cardinals team that led the majors during the regular season with just 66 errors and a .989 fielding percentage.\n\nIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nACUNA\u2019S BLUNDER\n\nAcu\u00f1a, playing for the first time since Sept. 24 after resting a sore left hip, may have cost the Braves an important run in the seventh by hot-dogging on a towering drive down the right-field line.\n\nApparently thinking it was a homer, the 21-year-old slugger jogged halfway to first carrying his bat before seeing the ball bounce off the wall. He wound up with only a single _ a reminder of a similar play in August which led manager Brian Snitker to yank the youngster out of a game against the Dodgers.\n\n\u201cHe should have been on second,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of short-handed to do anything about it right there. You hate to see that happen.\u201d\n\nAcu\u00f1a eventually made it to second on a groundout, only to get doubled off on Josh Donaldson\u2019s liner to end the inning\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCardinals: RHP Michael Wacha (right shoulder tightness) was left off the postseason roster, but manager Mike Shildt said he\u2019s \u201dmoving forward\u201d in hopes of being available later in the postseason should St. Louis advance. Wacha is expected to play catch soon before possibly advancing to a light bullpen session.\n\nBraves: RHP Chris Martin left without throwing a pitch in the eighth after reporting tightness in his left oblique while warming up. The Braves were forced to call in Luke Jackson, who was greeted with Goldschmidt\u2019s homer and would up being charged with both runs that inning. \u201cWe had the whole thing set up right where we wanted it,\u201d Snitker said. \u201cThat was a big blow.\u201d Atlanta could replace Martin on the roster before Game 2, but he would have to sit out the rest of the series as well as the NL Championship Series should the Braves advance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlaherty has been dominant since the All-Star break. The 23-year-old went 7-2 with a 0.91 ERA in 15 starts, the third-lowest in major league history over the second half behind Jake Arrieta (0.75) of the 2015 Chicago Cubs and Greg Maddux (0.87) of the 1994 Braves.\n\nAtlanta will counter with Foltynewicz, who also finished strong in a definite tale of two seasons. The 2018 All-Star was demoted to Triple-A in June with a 2-5 record and 6.37 ERA. Since rejoining the rotation in early August, he is 6-1 with a 2.65 ERA, claiming the second spot in the postseason rotation.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marcell Ozuna and Kolten Wong each hit two-run doubles in the ninth inning as the St. Louis Cardinals overcame shaky defense and a wild finish to extend Atlanta\u2019s postseason misery, holding off the Braves 7-6 in Game 1 of the NL Division Series on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Newberry"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/correction_nlds_cardinals_braves_baseball_59478_c0-73-1752-1094_s1770x1032.jpg?5389adaf473f932ccf9f7c4d2a78e25a63c8ae5b", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
