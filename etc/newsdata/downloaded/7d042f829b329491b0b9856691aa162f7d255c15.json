I then asked to try it too. I spun round and rolled it right over Jennifer's foot!\n\n'The producers look of panic was if to say, \"Is it too late to fire him? Has his character been established yet?\" I felt awful. Such an inauspicious start.'\n\nThis wasn't the only awkward encounter with Jennifer, who played Rachel on the show which is celebrating 25 years, that Paul had during filming.\n\nAwkward run in: Jennifer, pictured with Paul at the premiere of their 2012 film Wanderlust, had been using a Segway to help her get around on set after breaking her toe\n\nHe explained that while on set for the final episode which aired in 2004 he tried to comfort the actress, but things didn't go to plan.\n\nPaul said: 'The show was a phenomenon and I was in the very last episode, which made no sense to me whatsoever.\n\n'I was on the sound stage and Jennifer Aniston was crying and I thought, \"I'm not supposed to be here\", so to break the ice I went over and said, \"Well, we did it, what a ride.\" The joke inevitably fell flat!'\n\nDespite these awkward stories to look back on, Paul said the chance to be in Friends for 18 episodes as Phoebe's partner Mike was amazing.\n\nEnd of an era: Paul, second right, was in the finale in 2004, despite only being in 18 episodes and he said while filming he tried to comfort Jennifer, third left, but his joke fell flat\n\nThrowback: Paul played Mike Hannigan and ended up marrying Phoebe Buffay (, who was played by Lisa Kudrow, in the final season\n\nHe said: 'It was an incredible thing to be part of and the whole experience, but seems a bit surreal and a bit of a blur in my memory.'\n\nPaul and Jennifer also worked together in the 1998 film The Object Of My Affection, which tells the story of a pregnant New York City social worker who decides she'd rather raise her child with her gay best friend.\n\nMore recently, they played married couple George and Linda Gergenblatt who move from Manhattan to a rural commune in the 2012 film Wanderlust.\n\nSince then Paul has gone on to star in hit Marvel film Ant-Man as well as Parks and Recreation.\n\nHis next project is Netflix series Living with Yourself, where a man is replaced by a new and improved version of himself.\n\nWhat a line up: Bruce Springsteen, Robert De Niro, Sienna Miller and James Blunt also appeared on the talk show which will air at 10.35pm on Friday\n\nActing talent: While speaking about acting two different characters for his new Netflix show, Paul said: ' I cannot believe I am talking about how to act in front of Robert De Niro'\n\nWhile on Graham Norton, Paul explained how he kept the premise of the story clear in his head while playing both main characters.\n\nHe said: 'I really got into playing two different people but it was nuanced, not all Jekyll and Hyde, it was about the hair, the physicality and posture\u2026'\n\nHowever when he remembered he was with fellow guests and actors Robert De Niro, Sienna Miller, Paul stopped mid-sentence.\n\nHe said: 'I cannot believe I am talking about how to act in front of Robert De Niro.
