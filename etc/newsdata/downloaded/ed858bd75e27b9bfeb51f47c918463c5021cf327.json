(CBC)\n\nWearing traditional Indigenous clothing when you aren\u2019t Indigenous? Bad idea, Jones said.\n\nPainting your skin another colour than your own? Not OK, Jones said.\n\nJust ask Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nIn 2001, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was photographed dressed up in an Aladdin costume, including brownface makeup. (Time.com)\n\nTrudeau, who\u2019s getting a second chance to run the country following Monday\u2019s federal election, made headlines during the election campaign after photos started circulating of him dressed in blackface and brownface makeup.\n\nTrudeau apologized, but some Canadians said he should have known better.\n\nAs CBC Kids News discovered while talking to shoppers in Halifax recently, not everyone is worried about crossing that line when it comes to picking a Halloween costume.\n\nArjun Warrier, from Bedford, N.S., says he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for people to dress up in costumes representing cultures that aren\u2019t their own. (CBC)\n\n\u201cPeople have the right to express themselves and I don\u2019t take offence to cultural appropriation,\u201d said Arjun Warrier, from Bedford, N.S.\n\nCultural appropriation is another way of describing what happens when somebody adopts the elements of another culture.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Warrier said.\n\nEven so, it sounds like his kids are playing it safe this Halloween.\n\nThey\u2019re dressing up as a chicken and as Spiderman.\n\nWhether or not your Halloween costume plans are set in stone, check out Isabelle\u2019s video for more costume dos and don\u2019ts!", "description": "CBC Kids News contributor Isabelle MacNeil visits a costume store with a sociologist to learn more about offensive Halloween costumes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/HalloweenCostumes_thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
