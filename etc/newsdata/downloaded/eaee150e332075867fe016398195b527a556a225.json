Nastia, 29, shared an image on Instagram of her and Sam Martin, 29, trading sports uniforms for their Halloween costumes\n\nAmazing: The Olympic gold medalist when as her boyfriend, who works as a punter for the Detroit Lions\n\nThrowback: Then Sam, 29, went as his girlfriend from when she competed in the 2008 Olympics and won the all-around competition\n\nFor her costume, Nastia wore one of Sam's Detroit Lions jerseys and paired the look with white football pants. She also carried Sam's helmet and was wearing white sneakers.\n\nSam, on the other hand, found a way to fit into Nastia's pink leotard, or one that looks just like her own, from when she performed at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 to wear when celebrating Halloween.\n\nThe pink leotard Sam worn for the costume had the same bedazzled design on the front of the outfit from one Nastia wore in Beijing. But the sleeves looked to be slightly different from her go-to leotard on the gymnastics mat.\n\nDue to Sam's size, the couple could've potentially made a leotard similar to the ones Nastia performed in for the costume.\n\nSam also wore a blonde wig, black sweat pants, and Nastia's Olympic gold medal from when she became the 2008 Olympic all-around champion to complete the costume.\n\nThe costume was so impressive that even Nastia's friend and former Olympic team member Shawn Johnson, 27, decided to comment on the Instagram post.\n\n'GREATEST. COSTUMES. EVER,' Shawn wrote and added a skull emoji.\n\nLove: The couple first went public with their relationship in March when they shared images from a vacation they took together\n\nCelebrating: On Sunday, Sam surprised Nastia with an early birthday dinner ahead of her 30th birthday on October 30\n\nIn March, Nastia and Sam made their relationship Instagram official when they visited Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and the Maldives for a romantic vacation away from the states.\n\nStill fits! Shawn Johnson recently tried on her own Olympic leotard while 40 weeks pregnant\n\nThe trip away came after Sam finished up the football season with the Detroit Lions, a team he has played with during his entire career in the NFL after first getting drafted in 2013 as the team's punter.\n\nNastia and Sam have also shared other trips away on Instagram, including one vacation to Florida and another to Atlanta, Georgia, during their first few months as a couple.\n\nIn recent months, though, the couple has not shared publicly their lives together as much because Sam has been focused on the current football season.\n\nNastia has also been busy with her own career, and she often travels with NBC when covering gymnastics events.\n\nBut the couple was able to take time ahead of their Halloween celebrations to celebrate Nastia's 30th birthday, which she will turn on October 30. Sam surprised Nastia on Sunday with an early birthday dinner after his game that day.\n\n'A lions win AND an (early) birthday surprise...fun night last night,' Nastia wrote on Instagram. 'Thanks @sammartin_6 and everyone who helped plan AND celebrate, love you.'", "description": "Nastia, 29, shared an image on Instagram of her and Sam Martin, 29, swapping uniforms for their Halloween costumes.
