It would, the Obama administration noted, both \"enhance Israel\u2019s security and strengthen our bilateral relationship.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the MOU, the United States will set funding for Israel at levels of $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing and $500 million for cooperative programs for missile defense over each of the next ten years, a significant increase enabling Israel to acquire additional advanced military capabilities from the United States that will, over time, enhance Israel\u2019s security and strengthen our bilateral relationship. (U.S. Embassy in Israel)\n\nBut presidential candidate Bernie Sanders suggested on Monday at the J Street Conference that if he was the commander in chief, he'd make sure Israel meets some demands before the U.S. continues to honor the MOU. He began by noting how proud he would be to be the first Jewish president and acknowledged Israel's right to exist, but qualified it by noting Israel has to treat Palestinians better.\n\n\u201cI would use the leverage of $3.8 billion,\u201d he said of the MOU. \u201cIt is a lot of money, and we cannot give it carte blanche to the Israeli government, or for that matter to any government at all. We have a right to demand respect for human rights and democracy.\u201d\n\nSanders added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government \"has been racist.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Israel Nikki Haley, as you can imagine, had some words.\n\nJust when you thought Bernie Sanders couldn\u2019t get any more radical, he outdid himself. He wants to take money we give to Israel to defend itself from terrorists, and give it to Gaza, which is run by terrorists?? Unreal. Why isn\u2019t every other Dem pres candidate saying he\u2019s wrong? \u2014 Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) October 29, 2019\n\nHaley remains one of Israel's strongest defenders at the UN. In her tenure, she berated her fellow members for their biased, anti-Israel resolutions and promised them that the U.S. would not forget how they turned their back on America's Middle East ally.", "description": ".10/29/2019 11:02:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/af1ba20f-e0fc-4eb4-b782-42444ce0793c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
