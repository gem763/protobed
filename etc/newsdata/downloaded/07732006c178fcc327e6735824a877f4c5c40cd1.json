Harry Redknapp is just so lovely.'\n\nShe also praised the 'incredible young man' Han-Noah Massengo, a Bristol City FC player who helped raise awareness.\n\nRedknapp, a former football manager, posted an appeal to his 1.2million Instagram followers. More than 4,500 people have now donated.\n\nHe said: 'Please help us.

Please donate generously.'\n\nThe story of Michael's struggles made headlines around the world - including in the US\n\nHe was rushed to hospital seven months ago when he woke up gasping for air after suffering a cardiac arrest.

The tumour can interfere with the way the heart works, blocking blood flow to vital organs and causing an abnormal rhythm\n\nWHAT IS A CARDIAC FIBROMA? The tumour can interfere with the way the heart works, blocking blood flow to vital organs and causing an abnormal rhythm. Fibromas are the second most common heart tumour, accounting for 14 per cent of cardiac tumours in children, according to Boston Children's Hospital. They may obstruct blood flow and are often linked with arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia - when the heart beats faster than normal. Michael was fitted with a pacemaker after waking up from the coma, which should help control his heart rhythm. But unfortunately, because he is so small, the pacemaker restricts his movement. Currently, he is unable to sit up or support his own head. Only 200 cases of cardiac fibroma have been recorded in medical literature to date, figures suggest.\n\nMother-of-three Mrs Labuschagne, 27, added: 'We cannot believe the generosity we have been shown.\n\n'We are absolutely blown away with the response but it still hasn't sunk in yet. It's an extremely emotional time and we are so thankful for everyone's support.\n\n'As a family we will need a bit of time to process this, as this is just the beginning of Michael's journey.\n\n'We have been inundated with support from all over the world and I don't know how we can ever make it up to you all. It's been incredible and completely unexpected.\n\n'Nobody will ever understand the difference they've made to our families life - we are eternally grateful.'\n\nThe story of Michael's struggles made headlines around the world - including in the US.\n\nHe was rushed to hospital seven months ago when he woke up gasping for air after suffering a cardiac arrest.\n\nAfter waking up from the coma, his parents were told there was a high chance their baby had suffered brain damage.\n\nA scan revealed that this wasn't the case - however, his family were given the news that he did have a cardiac fibroma.\n\nThe tumour can interfere with the way the heart works, blocking blood flow to vital organs and causing an abnormal rhythm.\n\nFibromas are the second most common heart tumour, accounting for 14 per cent of cardiac tumours in children, according to Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nThey may obstruct blood flow and are often linked with arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia - when the heart beats faster than normal.\n\nMichael was fitted with a pacemaker after waking up from the coma, which should help control his heart rhythm.\n\nBut unfortunately, because he is so small, the pacemaker restricts his movement.
