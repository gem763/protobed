The weather can be great for everything from hiking in the mountains to basking on beaches. Or just check out the beautiful fall leaves. Even better, airfare prices are terrific, second only to winter in cheapness.\n\nInterested in Travel?

The prices listed are for round-trip tickets found on an airfare comparison site in early September; all are good for travel on scattered dates from September to November.\n\nCheap getaway destinations\n\nAustin, Texas: Saunter through the SoCo district for boutiques, antiques and galleries, but the best thing to do in the Texas capital is hit the clubs and listen to great music. Fly from Los Angeles starting at $113.\n\nBoston: New England's largest city is a gateway to beautiful foliage in New Hampshire and Vermont. Of course, Boston itself is a wonderful experience, thanks to its seafood, art galleries and a certain football team that seems to win a lot. Fly from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, starting at $90.\n\nDenver: The Rockies really are breathtaking, but so is Denver\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art with its rooftop cafe. Or go for a hike, eat a steak, ride a horse or take a craft beer tour. Fly from Dallas starting at $78.\n\nLas Vegas: Not a gambler? Not a problem. Vegas has a vibrant restaurant scene, plus its famous hotel and club pool parties aren\u2019t limited to summer. Fly from Chicago starting at $117.\n\nMiami: Warm beaches? Check. Hot nightlife? Yep. Fly from Chicago starting at $103.\n\nNew Orleans: The perfect city for Halloween devotees, New Orleans boasts ghost tours, cemetery excursions and even haunted pub crawls. Fly from New York starting at $127.\n\nFinding fall getaway deals\n\nCompare fares: Always shop an airfare search site , because checking prices from a single airline isn\u2019t good enough. Example: The Chicago to Las Vegas fare of $117 was Frontier\u2019s price, while Spirit\u2019s option for the same route on the same day cost $25 more. On other days, Spirit may have the very best deal, but the only way to find the cheapest price is by comparing fares. Don\u2019t skip this step.\n\nFly when it\u2019s cheap, not when it\u2019s convenient: Some prices are cheaper if you skip nonstop routes in favor of connecting flights, while still others may be cheaper if you fly Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of Fridays and Sundays. Inconvenience often equals savings.\n\nForget the fees: Keep your airfare total down by skipping the checked-bag fee, and the bigger seat fee. Sure, these things are nice to have, but they do add up. Ask yourself how long your flight is and then, how much comfort do you really need? I say, spend the money on the getaway.\n\nRick Seaney is the CEO for FareCompare.
