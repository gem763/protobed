The diminutive remote-control tank is noted for its formidable gun and missile armament.\n\nHowever, just a month later Defense Blog reported that Senior Research Officer Andrei Anisimov told a conference at the Kuznetsov Naval Academy in St. Petersburg that the Uran-9\u2019s performance in Syria revealed that \u201cmodern Russian combat Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are not able to perform the assigned tasks in the classical types of combat operations.\u201d He concluded it would be ten to fifteen more years before UGVs were ready for such complex tasks.\n\nThis stands in contrast to a source which told Jane\u2019s that the system had \u201c\u2026demonstrated high performance in an operational environment.\u201d\n\nRobotic armored vehicles are in development across the world, with the U.S. Army planning for its Bradley fighting vehicle replacement to be \u201coptionally-manned.\u201d However, Russia arguably has more aggressively moved towards combat-deploying UGVs. In 2015 Russia\u2019s Military Industry Committee announced its objective of deploying 30 percent of Russia\u2019s kinetic weapons on remote-control platforms by 2025. Current projects include the MARS six-seat infantry carrier, the robotic BMP-3 Vihr (\u201cHurricane\u201d) fighting vehicle, robotized T-72 tanks, and tiny Nerekhta UGVs that can evacuate wounded soldiers, fire a machine gun or kamikaze charge enemy positions.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "(But it didn't fight well.)", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wKIFDRw2HqbJv9aaw_4F6g--~B/aD05NDU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/d11df0ec7f280522be55836cce84efd5", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
