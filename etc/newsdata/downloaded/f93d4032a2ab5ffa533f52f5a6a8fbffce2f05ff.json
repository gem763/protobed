The answer to the once hard-to-fathom question is complicated.\n\nFor years, lawmakers have argued that intelligence personnel concerned about government actions \u2014 like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning \u2014 should go through formal whistleblower channels instead of illegally leaking government secrets.\n\nBut now, an unprecedented standoff between Congress and the Trump administration over a staffer who did go through the formal channels, only to have their concerns withheld from lawmakers, has laid bare a loophole in whistleblower protection laws that many thought would never be revealed: What happens when an intelligence agent blows the whistle on the president?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s a situation that has lawmakers pointing fingers and national security veterans rattled. Democrats are saying that the administration \u2014 not the law \u2014 is to blame. Republicans, long advocates for strengthening whistleblower protections, are blaming the media and saying President Donald Trump might be entitled to some constitutionally mandated privacy. Former officials and whistleblower specialists are saying Congress needs to ensure this never happens again.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the current situation has identified a deficiency in the law because it wasn\u2019t contemplated that there would be a refusal to transmit at least some information to Congress,\u201d said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represents whistleblowers.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a vocal proponent of whistleblower rights, was less disquieted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rumors floating around,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people writing about it that were not very accurate in what they wrote about Russia gate and all the stuff about Mueller so I\u2019m a little reserved what I say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be concerned just about these reports, I only get worked up when there doesn\u2019t appear to be cooperation on whistleblowing,\u201d Grassley said. He also noted that because the complaint involves the president, the information could be \u201cconstitutionally privileged.\u201d\n\nThe dispute centers on a mysterious whistleblower complaint apparently regarding Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is refusing to share with Congress, as is normally required by law. At a closed-door briefing with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, the intelligence community\u2019s top watchdog, Michael Atkinson, stonewalled Democrats' attempts to get answers, leaving them fuming.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cSomeone is trying to manipulate the system,\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters after the briefing.\n\nBut Atkinson may be legally prohibited from sharing details of the complaint with the committee because of Maguire\u2019s decision to withhold the information from Congress. According to Schiff, Maguire intervened to block the documents from being transmitted to lawmakers. Instead, Maguire diverted the complaint to the Justice Department, explaining to the committee that because the issue involved someone outside the intelligence community, it might involve matters of confidentiality and privilege.\n\n\u201cThere is no privilege that covers whether the White House is involved in trying to stifle a whistleblower complaint,\u201d Schiff shot back Thursday, threatening to sue over the issue or even withhold funding from intelligence agencies until they complied.\n\nIt's a stance that has irked some Republicans on the intelligence panel.\n\n\"If [Schiff] wants to engage in a conversation before all the facts are on the table, that's his prerogative,\" said Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. \"Until we know the facts and understand what happened, it's premature for me to speak to anything other than we're looking at the issue.\"\n\nThe confusion over the dispute highlights the fact that whistleblower protection laws never envisioned a scenario in which the director of national intelligence would withhold a complaint from Congress \u2014 especially one the inspector general had deemed \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nTypically, when the intelligence agencies\u2019 inspector general deems a complaint \u201curgent,\u201d it automatically triggers a requirement to notify Congress. Even if the IG refuses to slap the \u201curgent\u201d label on a complaint, the law includes a workaround that allows whistleblowers to go straight to the intelligence committees on Capitol HIll.\n\nBut once the DNI steps in, that workaround clause is essentially nullified. The whistleblower isn\u2019t supposed to go to the committee in that scenario, and the IG\u2019s hands are arguably tied.\n\n\u201cThis leaves the inspector general in a pickle,\u201d said Jim Baker, the former general counsel at the FBI. \u201cNow that the Justice Department, that\u2019s the law. As a technical matter, the inspector general has to fall in line. Or he could violate the law and tell Congress what happened, but be subject to prosecution if the information is classified.\u201d\n\nWhile Maguire may be technically adhering to the law, he is still \u201cpretty brazenly misusing\u201d the intelligence community whistleblower protection system, said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst for the Government Accountability Project who focuses on intelligence community and military whistleblowing.\n\nThe fact that Maguire is now trying to usurp Atkinson\u2019s sole authority to determine whether this whistleblower\u2019s complaint is both credible and matter of urgent concern \u201cis a body blow to the intelligence community inspector general\u2019s independence,\u201d McCullough added.\n\nWhile most Republicans avoided wading into the brouhaha, some did agree that the incident highlights potential flaws with the statute.\n\n\"I think it's important to protect the ability of whistleblowers to communicate to the committee,\" said Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), a member of the House Intelligence Committee and former CIA officer. \"I want to make sure this is streamlined and doesn't happen again.\"\n\nAtkinson himself seemed to agree, characterizing the standoff as a possible symptom of a law that can be exploited in a letter to the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Maguire\u2019s move, he wrote, \u201cmay reflect a gap in the law that constitutes a significant problem and deficiency concerning the DNI\u2019s responsibility and authority ... relating to intelligence programs or activities.\u201d\n\nSchiff argued that the legal statute is not the issue \u2014 it's how Maguire and other government attorneys are interpreting it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a problem of the law,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cI think the law is written very clearly. I think the law is just fine. The problem lies elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMaguire made the call to redirect the complaint after consulting with the Justice Department. The DNI\u2019s general counsel, Jason Klitenic, also determined that because the complaint doesn\u2019t involve someone \"within the responsibility and authority\" of the intelligence community, it can\u2019t be deemed \u201curgent\u201d and therefore doesn\u2019t require transmittal to lawmakers.\n\nAlthough Maguire has kept lawmakers in the dark, some contents of the complaint have been leaking into the press. The Washington Post on Wednesday reported that the complaint involved Trump making a \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader during phone call that disturbed the intelligence official. The New York Times on Thursday reported that the complaint involved a series of actions, not just one phone call.\n\nZaid, the whistleblower attorney, called Maguire\u2019s decision to essentially overrule Atkinson \u2014 rather than just register his disagreement in a separate memo or to withhold some, but not all, information \u2014 \u201ctotally inappropriate and not supported in any way.\u201d\n\nTo several whistleblowing attorneys, Atkinson\u2019s decision to alert the committee about the complaint \u2014 even if he wouldn\u2019t divulge any information about it \u2014 was its own form of whistleblowing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matryoshka doll of whistleblowing,\u201d said Kel McClanahan, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm National Security Counselors.\n\n\u201cIt would\u2019ve been procedurally proper for Maguire to forward a statement to Congress claiming privilege applies to the substance of the complaint, triggering a discussion over the privilege claim,\" he added. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t do that. He said, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an urgent concern\u2019 \u2014 an argument he\u2019s not even in a position to make under the statute.\u201d\n\nStill, because of the privilege issues at play and the legal loopholes, it\u2019s theoretically possible that Congress could never see the actual complaint. That\u2019s especially true because the invocation of executive privilege in this way is \u201cconsistent\u201d with how past administrations have handled such issues, Zaid noted.\n\n\u201cThis is not a Trump issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least the legal privilege issue is not.\u201d\n\nMarianne Levine, Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "What happens when the administration won't tell Congress about a whistleblower complaint regarding the president?
