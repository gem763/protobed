He did not address the risks or financial market tensions that central banks in Europe and Japan have confronted as a result of their negative rate policy, or the larger issue that negative rates have not secured higher growth or higher inflation for those economies.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWe have the great currency, power, and balance sheet... The USA should always be paying the ... lowest rate. No Inflation!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of (Fed Chairman) Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing,\u201d added Trump, who has repeatedly noted that rates are negative in Germany, Europe\u2019s trading powerhouse.\n\nThe president\u2019s comments precede a week in which the world\u2019s major central banks, including the Fed, are expected to lower rates or otherwise loosen monetary policy in what is widely seen as a move to protect the global economy against risks partly rising from Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nBut the quarter of a percentage point cut expected by the Fed is not likely to satisfy Trump, who has called on Powell and the Fed to quickly and dramatically cut rates as a way to boost slowing U.S. economic growth ahead of his re-election bid next year.\n\nLast month, however, Trump told reporters at the White House that he did not want to see negative rates in the United States, and analysts on Wednesday said the still-growing U.S. economy would be put at risk if the Fed pursued them.\n\nWhile perhaps appropriate in \u201crecessionary\u201d conditions, zero or negative rates in a growing economy with record-low unemployment \u201cmay ultimately create the next financial crisis - people taking on more risk than they would otherwise because money is even cheaper,\u201d said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump has bragged about his use of debt as a real estate investor. As far as managing the federal government\u2019s affairs, interest on outstanding U.S. Treasury securities will be nearly $400 billion in the current fiscal year and rise to more than $914 billion by 2028, according to the Pew Research Center. \u200b\n\nStill, interest accounts for about 8.7% of all federal outlays, down sharply from the mid-1990s when it accounted for more than 15% of spending following an era of ultra-high interest rates in the 1970s and 1980s, the Pew data showed.\n\nA White House official who asked to speak on background said in response to the president\u2019s tweets that \u201cthe president is looking at every tool available to lower the national debt and we ask Congress to join us in cutting back on wasteful spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cENEMY\u201d POWELL TO SPEAK NEXT WEEK\n\nTrump handpicked Powell as head of the U.S. central bank, but quickly soured on his by-the-book approach and insistence on Fed independence.\n\nThe president last month referred to him as an \u201cenemy\u201d on par with the head of the communist-led Chinese government and kept up his personal line of attack on Powell and the Fed in his tweets on Wednesday: \u201cA once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of \u2018Boneheads.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Powell said the Fed would act appropriately to help maintain the U.S. economic expansion and that political factors played no role in the central bank\u2019s decision-making process.\n\nHe will hold a news conference next Wednesday at the end of the Fed\u2019s two-day policy-setting meeting.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates in July for the first time in more than a decade. Financial markets expect the Fed to again lower its benchmark rate, currently at 2.00-2.25%, when it meets Sept. 17-18.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s name-calling, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters at the White House on Monday he expected Powell\u2019s job was safe, despite months of speculation that the president could seek to oust him.\n\nRISKY MOVE\n\nFed officials have downplayed the idea of setting their target policy rate below zero as politically untenable and not worth the risks. The policy is meant to account for extremely weak economic conditions by, in effect, charging banks to hold reserve deposits at the Fed.\n\nIn theory those banks would put the money to more productive uses. But it raises risks.\n\nBanks might pay less to savers as a result, and it can make it more difficult to operate at a profit. In addition, while the Fed\u2019s policy rate influences other borrowing costs, the interest rate on long-term government bonds Trump alluded to in his Tweet are set by larger market forces and depend mightily on perceptions about economic growth.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to address the 2019 National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) week conference in Washington, U.S., September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes has collapsed by half in recent months to a near record low \u2014 a reflection of doubts about the global economy and the impact of Trump\u2019s trade war as much as of Fed policy. Trump has cited the negative yield on Germany\u2019s 10-year bond approvingly, but it is a product of an economy nearing or perhaps in recession.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing public filings and financial experts, reported last month that Trump could also personally save millions of dollars a year in interest if the Fed lowers rates, given the outstanding loans on his hotels and resorts.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on the \"boneheads\" at the Federal Reserve to push interest rates down into negative territory, a move reluctantly used by other world central banks to battle weak economic growth that risks punishing savers and banks' earnings in the process.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428674416&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0TB", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
