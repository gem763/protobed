He's the best analyst. He's smart. He's clever.'\n\nBeau, who also worked as a presenter on The NRL Footy Show, said Andrew had told him he was keen to be in the thick of the action.\n\nChange of scenery? Speaking on KIIS FM on Friday, Beau said the rugby league legend simply wanted to focus on commentary instead.

It had nothing to do with Erin.'\n\nBeau said he sympathised with Erin, mainly because she 'cops it' on social media far worse than other television personalities.\n\nSetting the record straight: 'Andrew Johns didn't want to be on The Footy Show. It had nothing to do with Erin... he wants to commentate the games,' Beau said\n\nThe ex-Cronulla Sharks player added that Erin has faced an uphill struggle as there aren't many women in sports broadcasting, but she has handled herself 'brilliantly'.\n\nIt's not the first time Beau has spoken out in support of Erin, as he told The Daily Telegraph on Thursday the Johns saga had left her 'broken'.\n\n'I've been really close to Erin since she started [at Channel Nine] and have so much respect for her. You've got to remember she was one of the first women to come in and work in NRL,' he said.", "description": "Beau Ryan has once again come to Erin Molan's defence, claiming she wasn't the reason Andrew Johns stepped down from  The NRL Footy Show.", "authors": ["Demeter Stamell For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/04/19281692-0-image-a-12_1570160040933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
