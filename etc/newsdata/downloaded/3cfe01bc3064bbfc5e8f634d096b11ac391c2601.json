(AP) - A San Francisco developer who pressured California lawmakers into enacting the nation\u2019s most sweeping data privacy act is pushing a ballot measure to expand the law.\n\nAlastair Mactaggart\u2019s proposed November 2020 measure, to be unveiled Wednesday, aims to protect the California Consumer Privacy Act that is due to take effect on Jan. 1 by, among other things, creating a new state agency to enforce the privacy protections.\n\nVoter-enacted initiatives are much harder to alter than laws passed through the legislative process.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I want to make sure is they can\u2019t undo the act,\u201d Mactaggart told the San Francisco Chronicle about technology companies. \u201cThere is basically unlimited resources on one side of the fight. If you don\u2019t do anything, they will win eventually.\u201d\n\nMactaggart appeared willing to spend millions to back his new proposal, just as he did last year.\n\nFacebook and other technology and internet giants have been heavily criticized because personal information that millions of customers thought were private were shared, sold or used for targeted advertising.\n\n\u201cCompanies aren\u2019t taking their foot off the gas\u201d in using that kind of data, Mactaggart told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThey\u2019re saying full speed ahead.\u201d\n\nThe privacy act passed last year requires companies to tell consumers, upon request, what personal data they\u2019ve collected, why it was collected and what categories of third parties have received it. Consumers will also be able to ask companies to delete their information and refrain from selling it. It also bars companies from selling data from children younger than 16 without consent.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to data privacy regulation in the European Union.\n\nMactaggart\u2019s new proposal, which needs more than 600,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, would expand the users\u2019 control over the sale of their data. It also would require users under age 16 to opt in, rather than opt out, of collection of data such as their geolocation, race and Social Security numbers. For those under age 13, their parents or legal guardians would have to give permission.\n\nThe measure, called the California Privacy Enforcement and Data Protection Act, also would force technology companies to disclose details about their targeted advertising methods.\n\nThe Internet Association, an industry trade group whose members include giants such as Facebook, Amazon and eBay, wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment on the proposal.\n\nEmails seeking comment from the California Chamber of Commerce and from TechNet, a lobbying group composed of Silicon Valley executives, were not immediately returned.\n\nMactaggart spent more than $3 million to promote another data privacy measure for the 2018 ballot. He only withdrew that measure at the last moment after negotiating a deal that led the state Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown to approve the state law.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A San Francisco developer who pressured California lawmakers into enacting the nation's most sweeping data privacy act is pushing a ballot measure to expand the law.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
