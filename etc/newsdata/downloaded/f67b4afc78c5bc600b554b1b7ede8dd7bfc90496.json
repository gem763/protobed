She began her career as an intern for a then-NBC affiliate in Medford, Oregon, where her responsibilities included fetching mail and operating studio cameras. Ultimately, her goal was to become a reporter, and it was then that she received her \u201cworst advice\u201d from her then-boss.\n\n\u201cThere was no evidence that he believed that women could do the job. There had never been a woman in the newsroom before, and on top of that, this was happening in a place where there were very few people who looked like me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBesides Ann,\" she remembers being told, \"you can't carry the camera so you should not become a reporter.\u201d\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t deterred. She would go on to become the station\u2019s first female reporter, and it would be the beginning of a 40-year career in media.\n\n\u201cWhen I was given a goodbye party...the person who said that to me, he pulled me aside and said 'Ann, I don't want you to let anything I ever said to you stop you from your dreams because you can go all the way.\u2019 And I thought that was one of my greatest achievements, that I had transformed somebody's thinking about what was possible.\u201d\n\nTwo women were hired after Curry's departure, and today she says women make up more than half of that newsroom.\n\nCurry moved onto a larger market in Portland, Oregon, and then to a CBS affiliate in Los Angeles where she would win multiple Emmy Awards for her reporting. She eventually joined NBC News, first as a correspondent and eventually as a newsreader and then as co-host of \u201cToday,\" where she would spend nearly 15 years. Her career would take her around the world, covering international conflicts in places like Syria, Afghanistan, and Darfur.\n\n\u201cIf people are voiceless and there is something unjust that is occurring or something that can be changed -- suffering that can be changed -- because we connect them to the wider world, we should do it,\" Curry said. \"That is our job. We're supposed to shine light in places of darkness. That's our job.\u201d\n\nHer departure from the show in 2012 would make headlines as she tearfully signed off on-air as she sat alongside co-host Matt Lauer. Lauer would later be fired after a female colleague accused him of \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d\n\nLooking back, Curry says she would\u2019ve told herself, \u201cit's going to be alright\" -- and she was correct.\n\nAfter leaving NBC in 2015, she started her own production company and is now the anchor and executive producer of TNT and TBS\u2019s \u201cChasing the Cure.\" The show, which combines a weekly live broadcast with a digital component, helps people who are dealing with and suffering from, medical mysteries.\n\n\u201cChasing the Cure is an effort to connect people who are underserved, undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and connect them directly with doctors who can help,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is giving voice to the voiceless.\u201d\n\nHear more from Ann Curry on episode #130 of the \"No Limits with Rebecca Jarvis\" podcast.", "description": "\u201cThe worst advice I've ever received, it was when I was told that women have no news judgment,\u201d award-winning journalist Ann Curry tells ABC News\u2019 Rebecca Jarvis.  \u201cMy mouth said, \u2018Please give me a chance, I'm going to do a really good job,\u2019' Curry said.
