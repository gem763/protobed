Hide in plain sight, apparently. Just hours before the trial against his Nine Trey Bloods associates, Anthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison and Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack, is set to conclude, TMZ reports that Tekashi 6ix9ine has no plans to enter the witness protection program, despite calling out several gang members and celebrities during his testimony last week. Instead, he will be enlisting his own 24/7 private security for him and his family so he can continue his life of fame. It answers a lot of questions about whether or not his unique face tattoos would be laser-removed to better shield his identity. If granted time served, 6ix9ine will be out of jail and into the arms of his new security team in early 2020. The rapper testified against his former associates last week as part of a plea deal with the Feds to earn a lesser sentence for racketeering. The 23-year-old claims he got involved with the Nine Trey gang for protection and street cred. In return, he gave them a cut of the money he made with his music. But tensions rose until members of the gang allegedly turned on 6ix9ine and orchestrated his kidnapping. So, let\u2019s just say the bar is really, really low for his new security.", "description": "Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine won\u2019t be entering the witness protection program after he is released from jail, despite having a few enemies.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/26/26-tekashi-69.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
