On any ordinary scale they do matter - an annual deficit heading back up towards \u00a3100bn, and national debt closer to 90% of GDP for the first time in half a century.\n\nAnd all this comes at a time where the Institute concludes that the government is no longer taking its own fiscal rules seriously, borrowing more to spend more on public services even as the Treasury approaches its self-imposed limits. The Treasury acknowledged its fiscal framework was under review ahead of a Budget due before the end of the year.\n\nIn its Green Budget audit of Britain's, tax, spending and borrowing, the IFS calculates that the government's day-to-day spending plans for public services next year are now close to the levels suggested by Labour's manifesto at the last election in 2017.\n\nIf there is an election, the fiscal framing of it will be rather different to the last few. The Conservatives might not be attacking Labour over public spending or not funding their commitments. Labour might be brandishing helpful macroeconomic forecasts from at least some big banks.\n\nThese numbers hinge on assessments of the future path of the economy, should the UK leave the European Union with no deal.\n\nThe difference between the two now plausible extreme scenarios is an economy over 4% smaller by 2022 under no deal, than if Brexit were to be revoked.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption How will Brexit affect the UK economy?\n\nA further delay to Brexit would leave the economy 2.5% bigger by 2022, while a smooth Brexit deal would be 3% bigger, according to the macroeconomic forecasts provided for the IFS by economists at the bank Citigroup.\n\nThese researchers have gone further in calculating the path to remaining in the EU lying through a Labour-led Remain alliance government, that could not enact the most radical parts of the Corbynite domestic agenda, but could legislate for a referendum.\n\nIn contrast, a no-deal outcome requires a post-election Conservative government. The end result, perhaps surprisingly, is that one of the world's largest banks forecasts a Labour-led Remain government, leading to an economy that is 4% larger than a no-deal Conservative government by 2022.\n\nIf the Brexit issue can be parked, the IFS analysis points to some tricky long-term fiscal problems. Health and social care spending is now 42% of central government day-to-day spend, up from 26% two decades ago.\n\nIt is heading to close to half, which requires tough decisions on the system or on higher taxes. But no progress has been made on this issue, and many like this, as parliamentary and Whitehall time and effort continues to be dominated by Brexit. In any scenario, it seems difficult to imagine how this will change.", "description": "If there is an election, the fiscal framing of it will be rather different to the last few.", "authors": ["Faisal Islam", "Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/67D0/production/_104367562_umbrella_getty_976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
