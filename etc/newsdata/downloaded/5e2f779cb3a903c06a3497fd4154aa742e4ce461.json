The ball was hit so hard, outfielder Jarrod Dyson tried to scoop it up and fire to first base, but he bobbled the transfer and Machado reached easily.\n\nGallen had struck out six, walked one, hit a batter and thrown 88 pitches entering the seventh. The game was scoreless.\n\nGallen is a 24-year-old right-hander. He made his major league debut in June and began the night with a 2-4 record and 2.79 ERA in 12 starts, including five with Arizona since being acquired from Miami.\n\nThere have been four no-hitters in the majors this year, with Justin Verlander pitching one last Sunday for Houston at Toronto.\n\nThe last rookie to throw a no-hitter in the majors was Chris Heston of the Giants, doing it in 2015 against the Mets.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona Diamondbacks rookie Zac Gallen lost his no-hit bid with one out in the seventh inning on a clean single by the San Diego Padres' Manny Machado.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/padres_diamondbacks_baseball_45762_c0-151-3600-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?86a0ad2941f4f8cac64fde118e16286d6ebd0c8d"}
