Plus, inside Watson\u2019s incredible TD pass and Belichick stories", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m trying to think of a comp for Nick Bosa seven games into an NFL life. Pass-rusher, but a bull-rusher too. Did you see Bosa push mountainous Pro Bowl tackle Andrew Whitworth of the Rams back into Jared Goff two weeks ago? Pass-rusher, but a cover guy too. Did you see him shadow Christian McCaffrey on a wheel route out of the backfield Sunday against Carolina? Pass-rusher, but an acrobatic interceptor too. Did you see the leaping pick of Kyle Allen, evading three tackles on a 46-yard return?\n\nBut the main thing\u2019s the main thing: seven sacks in seven games (three in the first half of the Niners\u2019 51-13 home win Sunday), seven wins. Bosa\u2019s been a huge part of San Francisco\u2019s shocking 7-0 start. \u201cHe deserves rookie of the year,\u201d Richard Sherman said Sunday, \u201cbut right now he should be in line for defensive MVP.\u201d\n\nThe Lead: Nick Bosa\n\nSo much to get to today\u2014Belichick\u2019s 300th, Brees\u2019 comeback, Green Bay\u2019s 7-1, Deshaun Watson\u2019s play of the year, a Zebra-marred loss for the Bucs, the bizarre coaching stratagem of Matt Nagy, J.J. Watt\u2019s sorrow, Joe Flacco is pissed, Browns keep Browning. In due time, all of it. Bosa may have thought he was coming to a good spot when the Niners picked him second overall last April, but now he knows how fortuitous it really was: He\u2019s one of five first-round picks in the front four, and the rotation keeps the pressure up for four quarters. If any single element is most responsible for San Francisco\u2019s stunning rise to the top of the NFC West, it\u2019s the defensive front, which averages a sack on 12 percent of all pass plays.\n\nI\u2019d argue that Bosa\u2019s been the most impactful edge player to enter the NFL since Julius Peppers in 2002. Since 2000, 18 edge players have been picked in the top five in the past 20 NFL drafts. Bosa\u2019s seven sacks and one interception through seven games is exactly the stat line of Peppers\u2014and only Von Miller (six sacks, no picks) is close. No other player picked in the top five had more than four sacks in his first seven games. Probably only Peppers was asked to do as much as Bosa early, playing all over the field. And Peppers or Miller weren\u2019t the run player Bosa\u2019s shown so far. Bosa is a complete player in a room full of defensive-line stalwarts.\n\n\u201cI came into a really good situation with the D-line we have,\u201d Bosa said from California after the game. \u201cI was a little starstruck when I first came in here; I\u2019ve got a bunch of first-round picks I get to roll with, and you saw what we can do today when we get a lead and they\u2019ve got to throw.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to be one of the best picks in the last 10 years,\u201d said Sherman. \u201cHe plays like a 10-year vet, with such savviness and poise.\u201d\n\nOne of Bosa\u2019s sacks came when he was sent sprawling by a Panther tackle; he got up and dove at Kyle Allen and ankle-sacked him. The interception was the kind of play you\u2019d see from a DeAndre Hopkins-type of athlete. Left tackle Dennis Daley lunged at Bosa\u2019s knees, and Bosa went sprawling outside Daley to avoid it. And when he rose \u2026 well, let him tell it. \u201cEarly in the game, [Daley] cut me really bad. Obviously, I hate to get cut [have his knees dived at]. I played the cut to the outside, and I got up, and I looked in the quarterback\u2019s eyes. I saw what he was going to do.\u201d\n\nNick Bosa is a bad man! Just avoiding this cut block is impressive\u2026the rest is ridiculous. pic.twitter.com/EfcH5gtULe \u2014 Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) October 28, 2019\n\nThrow the quick pass in the flat to McCaffrey, Bosa meant.\n\n\u201cI jumped up, and the ball went right into my arms,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, it was just instincts.\u201d He escaped two tackle tries by Allen over the next 46 yards, and one by D.J. Moore, before Moore leg-tackled him near the five-yard line. The speed, the escapability, the moves\u2014Bosa could pass for Travis Kelce. Easy.\n\n\u201cEver play running back in your life?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWide receiver, tight end?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cOffensive guys aren\u2019t taught to tackle. I was able to make a couple moves.\u201d\n\nThe top of the NFC after eight weeks:\n\n1: San Francisco, 7-0.\n\nT-2: Green Bay and New Orleans, 7-1.\n\nT-4: Seattle and Minnesota, 6-2.\n\nThe 49ers have four games against their pursuers in the last eight weeks of the season. Saints, Packers, two with Seattle. They play Green Bay at home Nov. 24, then at New Orleans two weeks later. We\u2019ll know how good the Niners are by then. A three-week stretch against teams with a combined 19-4 record (Packers, Ravens, Saints) will be the toughest three-game stretch of their season, by far.\n\n\u201cHave you noticed how hard it looks down the road?\u201d I asked Bosa.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we got a game in three days. My focus is on that.\u201d\n\nArizona, Thursday night in the desert. Another quarterback to chase. Bosa versus Kyler Murray. Two cornerstone guys, born 11 weeks apart in 1997. It\u2019s amazing. The Niners got famous starting 40 years ago with an offensive genius molding two Hall of Fame quarterbacks. Now they might be poised to go on another strong run, and this time the defensive front shall lead them. Fascinating times for a resuscitated franchise.\n\nLegend of Deshaun 10\n\nI thought of three things watching a lot of Raiders-Texans:\n\n1. How sick must the Bears be, as their season goes down the tubes, watching Deshaun Watson and\u2014soon, again\u2014Patrick Mahomes make beautiful football happen for the Texans and Chiefs, two-and-a-half years after they passed on both in the 2017 draft?\n\n2. This was the kind of game, Raiders-Texans, that you felt Oakland was always going to make one more play. The Raiders never trailed for the first 53 minutes, and they just kept trumping every move Houston made. I thought: If Houston\u2019s got any chance, Watson\u2019s going to have to win it. He\u2019s slithery and reliable and so on-point, even when he\u2019s being chased all over creation. And he is ridiculously determined. You cannot teach desire. Watson has Russell Wilson/Tom Brady desire, and if Houston was going to win this game they probably didn\u2019t deserve to win, Watson was going to have to steal it.\n\n3. Some of his plays are so improbable, so rabbit-out-of-a-hat, that he looks like another southern kid at a young age, Brett Favre. Both Watson and Mahomes have some Favre in them.\n\n\u201cI wear 4 for a reason,\u201d Watson told me from Houston. \u201cThat last big play, that was definitely a Favre-type play.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an overreaction to say Watson\u2019s nine-yard TD pass to tight end Darren Fells saved Houston\u2019s season. The 27-24 win over the Raiders advanced them to 5-3 and kept them a half-game behind Indianapolis in the AFC South, which is deceivingly good. The division went 4-0 Sunday.\n\nI would argue, though, that it was the play of the year. Raiders up 24-20 with 6:30 left. At the Oakland 9-yard line, Watson took the shotgun snap. Surprise! Pocket caved. Watson knew he was in trouble right away. \u201cI was trying to buy some time, and the first guy [defensive end Arden Key] kinda grabbed me when I stepped up. I just tried to swing him out.\u201d\n\nKinda grabbed me. Truth is, Key had both arms around Watson\u2019s waist. This should have been a sack. But Watson wriggled semi-violently to escape Key at the 17-yard line, and as Key fell to the ground, the top of his right shoe found the gap between the bars on Watson facemask. \u201cNot sure if it caught me in the eyeball, but it went through the [mask] and got me,\u201d Watson said. \u201cMy whole left eye just shut\u2014went blank, went blind.\u201d\n\nAs Watson regained his balance, he pushed the helmet up almost imperceptibly so he could have a view of the field with his right eye. \u201cThat one was starting to go shut too,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt it. All I remember is my tight end rolling right with me, and then the second guy [defensive end Maxx Crosby] started to tackle me. I saw the tight end, and I threw, and I went down. I didn\u2019t see anything when I was down. I just heard the crowd go crazy. Figured we scored. Then I just laid there hoping my eyeball was good.\u201d\n\nAlmost sacked twice. Kicked in the face. Left eye reflexively closed. Vaguely sees tight end 19 yards away. Throws while looking out of one eye.\n\nTouchdown. Texans win.\n\n\u201cWhat am I gonna say?\u201d a crushed Jon Gruden said in the other locker room. \u201cYou see Michael Jordan, some of the great athletic plays, you gotta tip your hat to the guy.\u201d\n\nI asked Watson if he knew he was nearly sacked twice on the play by different guys.\n\n\u201cI felt even when they did grab me, I\u2019d have the athleticism to get it out, somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care what was behind me. I didn\u2019t care what was in front of me. I was gonna make something happen.\u201d\n\nRead those last three sentences from Watson. Isn\u2019t that what you want from your quarterback?\n\nWhile I spoke to Watson, I looked down at a text that might have been sent just prior to the call, or during it, from a Texans PR staffer. He has to see the doctor again. Please be quick. Watson said the eye is fine, but to be sure, the team will have him checked out today after a night of rest. Expect him to be okay. And it\u2019s not just the Texans who need him. If there is a Game 7 in the World Series on Wednesday night, Watson is due on the field before the game to do something to fire up the Astros crowd. My guess: It\u2019ll be effective.\n\nMore Week 8\n\nThe rest of the Week 8 story:\n\n\u2022 Wisconsin sadness. For the third time in four years, J.J. Watt will finish the year on injured-reserve. He tweeted that he tore his pectoral muscle in Sunday\u2019s win over Oakland. Surgery\u2019s likely Tuesday.\n\nThis game can be beautiful and it can also be brutal. Absolutely gutted that I won\u2019t be able to finish the season with my guys and give the fans what they deserve. I truly love this game and can\u2019t stand letting you guys down. Thank you for all of the thoughts & well-wishes. \u2014 JJ Watt (@JJWatt) October 28, 2019\n\nWatt, 30, had been Pro Football Focus\u2019s leading 4-3 end in disrupting the passer this year, with 52 sacks/hits/significant pressures in the first half of the season. Watt missed 13 games in 2016, 11 in 2017 and he\u2019ll miss eight this year. So over the past four years, he\u2019ll miss exactly half of Houston\u2019s regular-season games: 32 of 64. The injuries are all different: a herniated disc, a severe leg fracture and now a torn pectoral. As great a player as he is, the Texans can\u2019t count on him to be the centerpiece of their defense, as he has been. He\u2019s due $33 million over the last two years of his contract in 2020 and \u201921, with no guaranteed money, so you wonder if the Texans will talk to him about either a pay cut or moving some of his cash into a guarantee to lessen the cap hit. After Watt played so well in 2018 and being so disruptive in the first half of this year, the contract\u2019s not something anyone figured would be a Watt issue. And maybe it won\u2019t be. But you can\u2019t count on Watt to be an ironman anymore.\n\n\u2022 Wisconsin gladness. The Packers are a fun team to watch. Different team. Three touchdown passes by Aaron Rodgers, all to running backs, and one, for 67 yards, to emerging star Aaron Jones, broke a tie and won the game in Kansas City 31-24. \u201cI think the way we are winning is interesting,\u201d Rodgers said post-game. \u201cJonesy had 159 receiving yards tonight. I don\u2019t remember a [running back] running a slant and going for a 50-yard gain. We were talking on the sidelines how we want to close that game out on third and five, the consensus was to go with Jonesy. That says a lot about the kind of player he is. We are finding ways to win these games. The really good teams find a way to win when adversity hits.\u201d Jones is one of the big reasons why Rodgers has been able to still be prolific without Davante Adams. The fifth-round pick in 2017 from UTEP is a good route-runner determined to take advantage of his chance. \u201cThis scheme has given him a lot of opportunities to do a lot more out of the backfield,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019re splitting him out and throwing it to him.\u201d Green Bay seems optimistic Adams will return next Sunday at the Chargers after four games to rehab a toe injury.\n\n\u2022 Home field disadvantage. Chiefs on road: 4-0. Chiefs at Arrowhead: 1-3. Chiefs next week: home to Minnesota; Vikes are on a four-game winning streak. Uh-oh. Smart money says Patrick Mahomes will be back next week. If he is, he\u2019d better plan to be prolific. Kansas City\u2019s D has allowed 30 points or more in three of the past five games.\n\n\u2022 Chicago\u2019s in trouble. You knew that. Much more on the Bears lower in the column, particularly on the strange coaching decision by Matt Nagy in the final minute of a 17-16 loss to the Chargers. A couple of things to remember. If the officials didn\u2019t put a second back on the clock in Denver, Chicago would be 2-5 right now. And 3-4 doesn\u2019t look so good when the next three weeks are at Philadelphia, Detroit at home, and at the Rams.\n\n\u2022 Does Joe Flacco deserve to be testy? Changing times in Denver. The Broncos are 2-10 in their last 12 games dating back to last year, and the cleanout began last week. Wideout Emmanuel Sanders, who\u2019d been increasingly unhappy and was starting to demonstrate it, got shipped to San Francisco. There\u2019s a cadre of young players, I\u2019m told, led by Phillip Lindsay, Bradley Chubb and a couple of others chafing against the unhappiness of some vets left over from the Super Bowl team of 2015. That didn\u2019t have anything to do with Flacco bitching about punting on fourth-and-five with 1:55 left and needing a first down to run out the clock; the Colts drove to the game-winning field goal after Denver punted. Flacco just wanted to take a shot, figuring there was little to lose. But he\u2019s played mediocre football in his first half-season in Denver, leading most to think it makes sense for John Elway to continue to stockpile picks because Elway might want to be in the quarterback market. Again. (Denver has five picks in the first three rounds next April.) If the Broncos could get a sixth pick in the first three rounds next year for 30-year-old corner Chris Harris Jr., they should do it.\n\n\u2022 The dream is just about dead for Cleveland. At 2-5, Cleveland like has to go 7-2 down the stretch to have a playoff prayer. Where are those seven wins coming from? One: Miami. Two: Cincinnati, at home. Three: Okay, I\u2019ll give you Cincinnati on the road in week 17 aka The Andy Dalton Gold Watch Ceremony When the Bengals are 1-14. Then, maybe Denver on the road, maybe Arizona on the road. But Baltimore? Pittsburgh? Buffalo? If I\u2019m Freddie Kitchens, all I want is a 60-minute game. Play one of those, and we\u2019ll see if the season is remotely salvageable.\n\nBelichick 300 20\n\nBelichick Has Two Mountains To Climb\n\nMount Halas and Mount Shula, namely. After reaching his 300th win (regular season and playoffs), two men are in his way on the all-time victories list: George Halas with 324 and Don Shula with 347. It\u2019s easy to calculate the numbers and figure he could pass Halas in 2021 and Shula in 2023 or \u201824, but a few notes about that.\n\nOne: Belichick is 67; if he\u2019s still coaching in 2023, he\u2019ll be a 71-year-old man. Though he could pass for 55 today, age is age, so we\u2019ll see.\n\nTwo: Soon, maybe starting in 2020, Belichick will have to win without Tom Brady, who will be 43 in the 2020 season. The Patriots did win 11 games in the only season Brady missed due to injury, but Belichick has basically had the best quarterback of all time\u2014arguably\u2014for 18 of his 20 New England seasons, and 244 of his 300 wins. Can he win without him? As competitive as Belichick is, he has to feel what many around the league wonder in whispers.\n\nThree: Maybe the guy just wants to do something else. We just don\u2019t know that.\n\nFour: Lots of times people retire because of stress in the job, but those who know Belichick best say he\u2019s done this for so long in part because nothing football-related provides his stress; he\u2019s had such great role models (starting with his flatliner brilliant dad, the late Steve Belichick) and realizes all he can do is prepare the best he knows how and whatever happens happens.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s game, owner Robert Kraft presented Belichick with a game ball for reaching 300, and he mentioned his first win. The details:\n\n\u2022 Belichick win 1: Browns at Patriots, Foxboro, Mass., Sept. 8, 1991. Belichick\u2019s Browns 20, Patriots 0.\n\n\u2022 Belichick win 300: Browns at Patriots, Foxboro, Mass., Oct. 27, 2019. Belichick\u2019s Patriots 27, Browns 13.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference in the games:\n\n\u2022 New England quarterback in the first Belichick win: Tom Hodson (lifetime wins: 1).\n\n\u2022 New England quarterback in the 300th Belichick win: Tom Brady (lifetime wins: 245).\n\nI asked some of the people who have known Belichick over the years about a trait or story they have illustrating his football mind:\n\nCris Collinsworth\n\nNBC \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d game analyst\n\n\u201cThis week, we met with Aaron Rodgers and talked to him about how well the Green Bay offense is playing, and how his relationship with the new coach is developing. You know, good news stuff. But, in the beginning, when I did this job, I was at the bottom of the NBC NFL TV teams. I\u2019d do a lot of games with teams under .500. Invariably, I\u2019d be asking, \u2018Why do you stink?\u2019 With Bill in Cleveland, asking him that question in some form, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of fun. And believe me, when Bill is mad at you, it is bad. But he is also my favorite interview when he is engaged.\n\n\u201cPeople have never appreciated what a brilliant teacher he is. One time I asked him about how well one of his defensive tackles was playing\u2014the way he got his hands inside, the way he controlled his man\u2014and then Bill went on a 30-minute deal about defensive tackles. Everything about the position. I was stunned about the level of minute detail he went into about defensive tackles. I said, \u2018You should write a book about defensive tackles.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Cris, I could write a book about every position.\u2019\n\n\u201cBill\u2019s ability to develop talent is what separates him. He knows he can develop and train younger players, or improve players on the back-end of their careers, which allows him to let high-priced players walk. That ability to control his salary cap allows him to build depth on his roster. When injuries are destroying other teams late in the year, he still has quality players coming off the bench for the playoffs and Super Bowl.\u201c\n\nLouis Riddick\n\nSafety, Cleveland, 1993-95\n\n\u201cJanuary first, 1995. Single-most memorable day of my football career\u2014high school, college, pro.\n\n\u201cStevon Moore, the regular safety, was hurt. I was ready to go. Nick Saban\u2019s my defensive coordinator and my DB coach. Bill Belichick\u2019s my head coach. Playing Drew Bledsoe in a playoff game. Going to the stadium, I wasn\u2019t nervous. Nick is one of the great coaches of all time, and he had me totally prepared. We were playing a lot of single-high safety. On this one play, [safety] Eric Turner rotated down, and I was playing the deep part of the field. I remember getting good depth and seeing Drew throw it. He overthrew it. I thought, \u2018This ball is coming right to me! Don\u2019t drop it!\u2019 I caught it. And that day I had like 10 tackles. Great day. Next day, we go into the team meeting, and I figure I\u2019m getting a game ball. I sat down. I figure, had an interception, all these big hits. I am at the edge of my seat. Bill says, \u2018This guy had so-and-so tackles, had an interception.\u2019 Bill says, \u2018The defensive player of the game is \u2026\u2019 I literally start getting up out of my seat, and he says, \u2018Eric Turner.\u2019 I was like [exhaling air]. I sat back in my seat. And Eric, God bless his heart, says, \u2018Uh-uhn. No.\u2019 He tosses the ball to me, and everybody is clapping.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re walking out of the team meeting room. Bill\u2019s there. He looks at me. Just like this he says: \u2018What are you gonna do next week?\u2019 I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Man! That\u2019s rough!\u2019\n\n\u201cBut this league\u2019s about what you\u2019re gonna do, not what you just did. Great lesson. And that is exactly how Bill Belichick is.\u201d\n\nChris Simms\n\nCoaching assistant, New England, 2012-13\n\n\u201cOne of the dirty secrets of the NFL is how the Patriots\u2019 attention to detail and creativity goes way beyond other coaches I\u2019ve seen. Their building is as on edge and in the same full grind mode on May 25th as it is on Nov. 25th. Preparing in the offseason is like preparing for a playoff game. After a while\u2014I was there about 16 months\u2014I started to realize that bulletin-board material doesn\u2019t exist for the Patriots. They don\u2019t care about anyone else. They care about internal motivation, not external.\n\n\u201cIt was Mother\u2019s Day weekend one time, and we\u2019re in there on a Saturday, and we\u2019re thinking, \u2018Sunday off! Great!\u2019 So we\u2019re working hard on a Saturday and in a staff meeting, Bill says, \u2018I\u2019ll let you guys sleep in tomorrow. Let\u2019s come in at 11.\u2019 Someone says, \u2018Bill, tomorrow\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day.\u2019 Like, if you\u2019re married with kids, you need to do some family things Mother\u2019s Day. He\u2019s like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s right.\u2019 He gave everyone the day off, and he was fine about it. But he was oblivious to it.\n\n\u201cI remember watching the Super Bowl against Seattle when I was with Bleacher Report. Seattle\u2019s down near the goal line, ready to score and win the game, and Bill\u2019s not calling a timeout. I was sitting there, like, \u2018What is he doing! Call a timeout!\u2019 And of course it worked out, and Bill knew that by not calling the timeout he was putting pressure on the Seahawks to make a quick decision about their play-call at the goal line. In New England, nothing happens without it being thought out.\u201d\n\nMike Vrabel\n\nLinebacker/tight end, New England, 2001-08\n\nWith the Patriots in cap trouble entering Belichick\u2019s second year, 2001, New England signed 17 mostly backup or bit players in the 2001 offseason, including Pittsburgh special-teamer/backup linebacker Vrabel.\n\n\u201cI had kind of stalled in Pittsburgh, and you always wonder what you\u2019d do if you ended up getting cut one year. I would probably have gone back to school. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have been as eager to get into coaching when I was that young. When the Patriots gave me the offer, I was going to have more of a chance to get on the field. I brought it back to Pittsburgh and told coach [Bill] Cowher. He said, \u2018We can match the money, but not the opportunity.\u2019 So I went to New England.\n\n\u201cOne day that first year Bill walked up to me and said, \u2018Remember in that Miami preseason game last year\u2014how you played the power block? That\u2019s how we want to do it here.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t all that much tape on me in Pittsburgh, but he found something he saw in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to warm up with Drew Bledsoe before games, and he\u2019d throw me quite a few passes. Drew told [offensive coordinator] Charlie Weis, \u2018This guy can play tight end if we need it.\u2019 So eventually they started asking me to come over on Fridays and get the tight end plays, and maybe they\u2019d use me. [Vrabel caught 12 passes for 12 touchdowns in the last nine years of his career.] What that taught me is Bill uses the whole roster. He puts more stuff on guys who can handle it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken a lot from a lot of coaches in my life\u2014Urban Meyer, Bill Cowher, Bill [Belichick], Bill O\u2019Brien\u2014but what sticks with from New England is that Bill held the best players the most accountable. He wants everyone on the roster to know he\u2019s going to demand the most from the best players.\u201d\n\nMatthew Slater\n\nSpecial-teams player, New England, 2009-present\n\n\u201cIn our first playoff game in the 2016 season, we did not play well at all. We beat Houston, but we knew after the game it wasn\u2019t a good game for us. Honestly, it was like we lost. I don\u2019t know any other place in the league where you win a playoff game and it feels like that.\n\n\u201cBill wasn\u2019t emotional, he wasn\u2019t loud. He was just matter-of-fact, straight to the point. He said, \u2018If we play like that again next week, we\u2019re gonna get beat.\u2019 Nothing dramatic. Just the truth. Regardless of the outcome, he was going to tell us the truth.\n\n\u201cAs people in life experience great success, and things come a little easier for them, they tend to change. It\u2019s human nature to become a little complacent. It can be exhausting to maintain the all-in mentality in anything in life year after year, decade after decade. But he has. Bill\u2019s most unique ability, I think, is to avoid complacency. His standard, his love of football, his preparation every week, every year, it\u2019s never changed.\n\nThe Award Section\n\nOffensive Player of the Week\n\nGardner Minshew, quarterback, Jacksonville. He\u2019d cooled off a little since his wild start, losing two of his previous three entering Sunday\u2019s game against the Jets. So it was the Jets. Gotta play the next team on the schedule. But what\u2019s become obvious after his eight NFL games (seven starts) since being the 178th pick in the draft is what a smart player he is and what excellent pocket awareness he has. In Jacksonville\u2019s 29-15 win over the Jets, Minshew was 22 of 34 for 279 yards with three TDs and no picks (119.6 rating), and two plays stood out. First quarter, down 7-6, heavy rush\u2014Minshew steps up, then to the right, then up, then throws on the run to Chris Conley, who makes a 70-yard catch-and-run touchdown. Fourth quarter, nursing a 22-15 lead, driving\u2014same kind of play, juking and jutting outside the pocket to avoid the rush, and a quick dart for an eight-yard TD pass to D.J. Chark. I\u2019ll take this guy on my team any day.\n\nMiles Sanders and Jordan Howard, running backs, Philadelphia. The Bills had allowed just 91 rushing yards per game this season, good for 10th in the league, and it was the Buffalo D keeping the Bills close to the Patriots in the AFC East. But the Eagles, on a windy and tough day for the offenses, ran 41 times for 218 yards. Howard had 96 yards on 23 carries, many of them gritty carries between the tackles. Sanders is rapidly becoming the best back to come out of the 2019 draft. The 53rd overall pick from Penn State had the kind of offensive game few have had against the Bills this year\u2014on just six touches. Those six touches generated 118 yards, including a 65-yard game-breaking touchdown run in the first minute of the second half.\n\nMatt Schaub, quarterback, Atlanta. I\u2019m not big on giving awards to guys for gaudy stats only, so the fact that Schaub, who\u2019s been a backup for most of the past six years, threw for 460 yards against Seattle isn\u2019t the only reason why he\u2019s in here today\u2014after a 27-20 Atlanta loss. But in his first start since 2015, Schaub led the Falcons from a 24-0 halftime deficit to the brink of a stunning comeback. He led scoring drives of 75, 34, 75 and 67 yards in the second half, and Seattle needed an onside kick recovery with 1:17 left to hang on. It was the biggest passing day for Schaub since Nov. 18, 2012.\n\nAaron Jones, running back, Green Bay. In a surprising battle of quarterbacks\u2014Aaron Rodgers vs. Matt Moore?\u2014it was really Jones who stole the show. Twenty touches, 226 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winning score on 67-yard catch-and-run in the fourth quarter. And Jones actually left this game with a second-quarter shoulder injury and was questionable to return. Nothing questionable about his performance.\n\nDefensive Player of the Week\n\nNick Bosa, defensive end, San Francisco. The most impactful first overall pass-rusher in years (Myles Garrett\u2019s excellent, but wasn\u2019t as great out of the gate as Bosa) overwhelmed Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen with three sacks and a leaping interception\u2014and he ran 46 yards with the pick, leaving three Panthers grasping at him with running back-type moves. He\u2019s had six sacks in the last four Niners games, all decisive victories, which is not a coincidence.\n\nSpecial Teams Player of the Week\n\nMichael Dickson, punter, Seattle. It hasn\u2019t been a great sophomore season for the Aussie, but he had a big day in Atlanta. His four punts netted 47.8 yards and left the Falcons starting drives at their 10, 37, 14 and 14-yard lines in a seven-point Seahawks win.\n\nCoach of the Week\n\nBill Belichick, head coach, New England. Became the third coach in the 100 seasons of pro football to win 300 games, handling the Browns on a raw, rainy day in Foxboro. Seemingly, there\u2019s more where that came from.\n\nRobert Saleh, defensive coordinator, San Francisco. Saleh has taken the premier pieces handed him by GM John Lynch and crafted them into a fearsome defense. The Panthers came to Santa Clara on a four-game winning streak, rested off their bye, and the Niners held them to 230 yards (every one, seemingly, gained by Christian McCaffrey) and a stifling 2-of-13 on third downs. The seven-sack, three-interception performance was the latest in a string of four superb performances by the D (points allowed: 3, 7, 0, 13; yards allowed: 180, 157, 154, 230) that is Patriots-like.\n\nGoat of the Week\n\nDavid Oliver, down judge, Tampa Bay-Tennessee game. We\u2019ve been over this quite a few times\u2014when in doubt, officials have been told time and again to let the play go to its conclusion, even if they think the ballcarrier might have been down. On Sunday, such a play might have enabled the wrong team to win in Nashville. With 3:45 left at Tennessee, nursing a 27-23 lead, the Titans, with the ball at the Bucs\u2019 28, lined up for a 46-yard field goal try. Taking the snap, holder Brett Kern rose and starting running around left end. A fake. Tampa Bay\u2019s Devin White stopped him cold with a brutal hit, and the ball popped loose as Kern fell; it was definitely out before he hit the ground. Anthony Adams of the Bucs picked up the fumble and returned it 72 yards for an apparent touchdown. But Oliver, as you see on replay, is seen waving his arms over his head, signaling the end of the play. Instead of Tampa Bay going ahead then, the Bucs took possession at the 28 but couldn\u2019t score on their final two possessions either. Oliver is a good official, and he clearly looked to see if Kern got the two yards and when it was clear he didn\u2019t, Oliver assumed Kern hit the ground and was down. It cost the Bucs seven points and quite possibly their third win.\n\nQuotes of the Week 30\n\nI\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now a 2-6 football team and we\u2019re afraid to go for it in the two-minute drill. \u2026 It just feels like we\u2019re kind of afraid to lose a game. \u2026 Why can\u2019t we be aggressive in some of these situations?\u201d\n\n\u2014Denver quarterback Joe Flacco, on the play-calling late in the 15-13 loss to Indianapolis.\n\nWith 1:55 left, Denver up 13-12 and the Broncos facing fourth-and-five at the Colts\u2019 43-yard line, the Broncos punted.

But he\u2019s not winning everywhere. He is losing in his family\u2019s fantasy football league, including to his twin brother Jason\u2019s wife, Melissa McCourty. Jason is not in the league.\n\n\u201cFirst off, I would say I\u2019m not that good at fantasy football. It\u2019s been a little bit of a struggle. I\u2019m under .500. She [Melissa] was lucky enough to draft the Patriots\u2019 defense. Each week, even when the week\u2019s not going well, she\u2019s kind of been bailed out. I don\u2019t know if it was her genius or [Jason] forcing her to draft them while she was in the house. It\u2019s working out really well for her. I think she\u2019s like, either first or second in the league overall. Dominating a bunch of college football players [in the league]. It\u2019s not looking good for us.\n\n\u201cJason\u2019s a different type of guy. He\u2019s always complaining about something or saying, \u2018This fantasy football stinks. It\u2019s ruining the game.\u2019 So whenever me and his wife, whenever all four of us are together with my wife, we start talking about it and he gets all angry but no one really cares.\n\nHave you played her yet this year?\n\n\u201cYeah, she beat me pretty good. Ha ha. I was going to [pick the Patriots\u2019 defense and special teams], but everyone told me you have to start off picking running backs. This is my first year.

People who looked like they were quite staid by day were letting loose, dancing with Ray Charles guy to \u201cWhat\u2019d I Say.\u201d Down the street, a guy in bagpipes played \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame.\u201d That\u2019s what this place was like Friday night. Just happy. So happy to be here.\n\nFew thoughts:\n\n\u2022 Good ballpark, very hard to move around in a big crowd. Decided early that my only trips away from my seat (halfway between third base and left field pole) would be men\u2019s room trips. And that was fine. All it meant was I drank Budweiser at the seat\u2014which, again, was fine. It\u2019s been a while since I had three Buds, but I have good memories of them. Good location to (barely) hear the Robinson Chirinos home run ping off the foul screen.\n\n\u2022 The Washington crowd loves the Nats. The crowd loves-loves-loves Juan Soto.\n\n\u2022 I marvel at Jose Altuve. How great is this guy? Ridiculously clutch, hits lasers. Nats shortstop Trea Turner too. Ball explodes off his bat, and I starred two of his defensive plays (out of four great plays on the night, per me) on my scorecard.\n\n\u2022 Speaking of scoring the game, I\u2019ve included my scorecard from the game, which I kept in my Bob Carpenter\u2019s Baseball Scorebook. (My favorite book, because it gives me room to record my inane comments during the game.) I am the only person left on the planet who scores games, I think. I did not see another person scoring the game Friday night. In the seventh-inning stretch, a guy, maybe 50, across the aisle said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re doing?\u201d I explained, and he said he\u2019d been going to ballgames, a couple a year, for a while and didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen someone keeping score at a game. That shocked me. I know it\u2019s not common now, but I didn\u2019t know just how nerdy I was. I guess it keeps me in touch with my roots in the game.\n\n\u2022 Great idea, having Buzz Aldrin moon-shot a first pitch. Fifty years ago, when Ted Williams\u2019 Senators roamed the diamond in D.C., Aldrin walked on the moon.\n\n\u2022 I like those dopey presidents, in the dopey presidents race. Older guy came down from higher in the section with Abe Lincoln cavorting with some fans. \u201cABE! AAAAAABE!\u201d the 60-ish guy said, holding his iPhone up to take a photo of Abe, hoping he\u2019d stay still for a second. The guy acted like a 12-year-old seeing Taylor Swift.\n\n\u2022 Told Titans coach Mike Vrabel on Saturday morning I went to the Game 3 of the Series. It ended 12:10 am ET, and lasted 4 hours, 3 minutes. Vrabel put it perfectly: \u201cFour hours is a long time for five runs.\u201d\n\nStrategy of the Week 50\n\nEach week, with the aid of Pro Football Focus research, I\u2019ll take a big call in a game from the weekend and explain the whys, and whether it made sense from an analytical view.\n\nGame: Los Angeles Chargers at Chicago, Sunday.\n\nSituation: Fourth quarter, Chargers ahead 17-16. After a Mitchell Trubisky 11-yard scramble gave the Bears a first down at the Chargers\u2019 21-yard line, 43 seconds remained, and Chicago had one timeout left.\n\nThe decision: Instead of trying to get the ball closer to the goal line with a sideline pass to stop the clock, or a pass inbounds with plenty of time to stop the clock before a field-goal attempt, or instead of handing it to rookie back David Montgomery after he\u2019d rushed for a career-high 135 yards on the day, Bears coach Matt Nagy called for quarterback Mitchell Trubisky to kneel on first down, losing a yard. On second-and-11 at the Chargers\u2019 22, Nagy chose to let the clock run down to four seconds.\n\nThe thought process: Nagy, post-game, said he had \u201czero thought of running the ball and taking the chance of fumbling the football. They know you\u2019re running the football so you lose three, four yards \u2026 That wasn\u2019t even in our processes \u2026 We were in field-goal range before the scramble and then we got the scramble so that didn\u2019t even cross my mind \u2026 Throw the football? Throw the football right then and there? What happens if you lose the ball? \u2026 Zero thought of throwing the football, zero thought of running the football.\u201d Obviously, Nagy is not going to say he didn\u2019t trust Trubisky to get 10 or 15 extra yards safely there, but I can name 15 coaches in the league who trust their quarterbacks enough to let him try to get the ball closer, or to score a touchdown.\n\nThe analytics: PFF analyst Eric Eager said: \u201cAn additional five yards leads to, on average, five percentage points in favor of making the kick and hence an additional five percentage points in favor of winning the football game outright. While there is always a chance of a turnover or a loss of yards, the chances the Chargers defense would either play conservatively so as not to give up a chunk play, or be willing to let the Bears score so that they could get the ball back with enough time to score themselves were probably higher. Given how close the field goal was to slipping through the left upright, every yard counted, and the Bears mistakenly decided to surrender them.\u201d\n\nThe result: Eddy Piniero kicked the 41-yard field-goal attempt barely wide left. The Chargers won, 17-16, dropping the Bears to 3-4, three-and-a-half games out of first place in the NFC North with nine games to play.\n\nA PFF Elite subscription gives you access to performance metrics the pros use.\n\nThe NFL Century\n\nDuring pro football\u2019s 100th season, I\u2019ll re-visit important games, plays, players and events from NFL history.\n\n1919: The Birth Of The Packers\n\nFascinating and entertaining historical tome by Mark Beech out this fall, \u201cThe People\u2019s Team: An Illustrated History of the Green Bay Packers.\u201d The formation of the team is quite cool.\n\nFounder Curly Lambeau came from a pugnacious background, shall we say. His grandfather, who emigrated to Green Bay from Belgium in 1873, shot his wife in the neck on a Green Bay street corner in 1891, then turned the revolver on himself, killing himself with a shot to the temple. She survived. Curly was born in 1898. Loved sports. Enrolled at Notre Dame in 1918. Scored at least one TD for the Fighting Irish in a war-depleted 1918 season. But Lambeau came back to Green Bay in early 1919 because of illness and because of financial troubles. He got a job as a shipping clerk at the Indian Packing Company in Green Bay; the business shipped canned meat from Wisconsin to U.S. Service members. That summer, Lambeau, more than smitten with football after his brief stay at Notre Dame, got his boss at Indian Packing to donate $500 for team uniforms and equipment. (Indian Packing was bought by Acme Packing in 1920. Thus the team name \u201cPackers.\u201d) At the same time, per \u201cThe People\u2019s Team,\u201d the local paper, the Press-Gazette, became boosters for the team, urging all able-bodied men with any athletic skill to come play for the team, running 15 stories in late summer with little more than organization details printed.\n\n\u201cFootballers on the Indiana Packing Corporation squad will hold an important meeting in the editorial rooms of The Press-Gazette on Friday evening at 7:45. It is of utmost importance that every man be on hand as final plans for the season will be outlined.\u201d\n\nIt was a town team, as most of the early pro teams were, with 17 of 25 players on the 1919 Packers being from Green Bay. They finished 10-1. In mid-1921, with Lambeau determined to make the Packers big outside of Wisconsin, the Packers joined the American Professional Football Association, the precursor to the NFL.\n\nTen years after their founding, in 1929, the Packers beat the New York Giants 20-6 on the road and went on to win their first NFL championship. \u201cThe Packers had weapons that the local outfit could not match,\u201d the New York Times wrote the next day. For their efforts, the players all got $220 \u2026 and pocket watches.\n\nTweets of the Week 40\n\nI\n\nHighlight of the game is Nantz shouting out his father-in-law's popcorn shop in Chagrin Falls. \u2014 Aaron Goldhammer (@HammerNation19) October 27, 2019\n\nAaron Goldhammer, obviously chagrined after the Browns dropped to 2-5 in Foxboro, is a Cleveland talk-show host.\n\nII\n\nI want to like Freddie Kitchens.

Reach me at peterkingfmia@gmail.com, or on Twitter @peter_king.\n\nDon\u2019t overreact. From Chris Morris of Richmond, Va.: \u201cCan we admit that Matt Nagy is just a scared coach? In his presser, he admitted that he was not aggressive because he was scared of a fumble, scared of losing yards, scared of an interception, scared of a sack. I think it is time for us Bears fans to admit he just isn\u2019t cut out to be a head coach in the current NFL, where aggression wins and you have enough confidence to act like mistakes never happened. Also, it is more obvious than ever that Andy Reid is a masterful coach who will never get enough credit due to coaching in the Belichick era. He actually won in spite of having Nagy on staff.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not fair. Nagy is a good coach, though the results this year don\u2019t show it. Think if you\u2019re Nagy\u2014and I am going to do that right here, and pretend I\u2019m him. I\u2019ve watched Mitchell Trubisky all day, and he\u2019s mirrored what he\u2019s done all year. You hold your breath when he pulls his right arm back to throw. Now there\u2019s 43 seconds left, and Nagy has to decide what to do: let the clock run down and take the 41-yard field goal try, which seems like a 65-percent shot; or either run it once or twice, or maybe throw one only if the receiver is clearly open, or to the sideline where only the intended receiver can catch it. I\u2019d have at least tried a run and a sideline throw. I think almost every coach in the NFL would. Nagy with a C-plus quarterback probably would have too. But\u2014and this is me reading Nagy here\u2014Nagy had to feel paralyzed by the worst quarterback in football (at least now), and so he played it painfully safe. And his kicker didn\u2019t bail him out.\n\nFire Riveron. From John Newman: \u201cPenalties in NFL games are up by something like 20 percent in the past 10 years, and while I believe a penalty is a penalty and if it\u2019s seen, it should be called, it\u2019s getting excessive and completely inconsistent. I lay the bulk of the blame at [senior VP of officiating] Al Riveron\u2019s feet. As soon as he became the man in charge of video reviews, the \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 standard for overturning calls went out the window. It\u2019s gotten worse with time, culminating in the joke of challenging uncalled pass interference this season. Riveron lied to you, the teams and the fans about how these challenges would be handled. He\u2019s got to go.\u201d\n\nJohn, he well might go at the end of the year. I don\u2019t know. If he does, the biggest reason will be the inconsistency of his rulings\u2014there is no question about it. But I do want to defend Riveron for one thing: The NFL is paying him (way too little, in my opinion) to be a shield for the Shield, to stand and take the immense heat for the things Roger Goodell and Troy Vincent don\u2019t want to take the heat for. And we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s been told, essentially, to overturn no pass-interference flags or challenges. Modern technology and the wildly clearer pictures we see of close plays make his job and the job of officials much harder than 15 or 20 years ago. So if he gets fired, his replacement might have a nice six-month honeymoon, but as long as replay exists, the top ref\u2019s job is going to be full of headaches.\n\nOwners shouldn\u2019t cave to the Jalen Ramseys. From William Theede: \u201cNFL players unhappy with their current team and status are acting up like their NBA counterparts\u2014holding out, whining and faking injuries. The NFL needs to have owners (without collusion) \u2018grow a pair\u2019 and send them home, fine them, negate their contracts, anything legal to shame them the way they\u2019re shaming the team owner, coach and fans. It should be easy for the billionaire owners to lose a few million to stop this trend for them and their fans.\u201d\n\nWilliam, in an ideal world, you\u2019re right, and I\u2019d love to see the line held on guys like Jalen Ramsey. But the fact is this, in his case: The Jaguars knew they weren\u2019t going to re-sign him, they knew it was going to be a headache to have him around, and they knew if they could get two first-round picks for him, it was a deal they had to make for the future of the franchise. As for the Rams getting him, they weren\u2019t the only team willing to given significant compensation for him; I thought he\u2019d end up with the Eagles. There will always be a market for the top players.\n\nInteresting question. From John Nguyen. \u201cYou\u2019re a voter for the numerous end-of-year awards, so I\u2019m very interested for your views on this. I was watching highlights of Devon Hester on YouTube and it got me thinking: Why is there not a Special Teams Player of the Year award? Surely, as the third phase of the game, special-teams players such as Matthew Slater or Greg Zuerlein should be recognized for their exemplary play.\u201d\n\nI will forward your email to the Associated Press NFL keeper of the awards, Barry Wilner, with my agreement. It\u2019s a great idea, and I don\u2019t know why I never thought of it before. I love it, in fact. I remember back when the Bills were winning the AFC every year, the late and great special teams coach, Bruce DeHaven, once gave me a videotape cassette with 10 special-teams plays on it. The 10 plays, he said, were huge plays made by Steve Tasker, the man I consider the best special-teams player of all time. DeHaven also said they were the biggest plays in 10 victories by the Bills during the AFC championship run. Not the 10 biggest special-teams plays, but the 10 biggest plays, period. Kick blocks, punt blocks, big returns, a punt downed inside the 5, etc. Thanks for the idea.\n\nThere is a chance Frank and I are going to get into a scrum over the word scrum. From Frank Way: \u201cWhy do sportscasters and sportswriters and even veteran play-by-play men continually misuse the word scrum? I would expect that knowledgeable sports folks should know that a rugby scrum is the most orderly thing in the world. It is eight men (or women) directing an enormous amount of force against another eight seeking to do the same thing in the opposite direction. If it is not orderly and in sync it can fail miserably and ruggers can get hurt. Necks can get broken. Yet play-by-play and sportscasters continually refer to any type of melee, be it in the corner of a hockey rink or in a locker room, as a scrum.\u201d\n\nFrank, I think you, and they, are using the word correctly. Merriam-Webster has four definitions: 1) A rugby play in which the forwards of each side come together in a tight formation and struggle to gain possession of the ball; 2) A usually brief and disorderly struggle or fight; 3) [British] Madhouse; 4) A usually tightly packed or disorderly crowd.\n\n10 Things I Think I Think 30\n\n1. I think this is what I liked about Week 8:\n\na. The Titans cheerleader, catching the Tampa Bay punt cleanly in Nashville.\n\nb. Max Crosby of the Raiders, with a huge tackle-for-loss of Houston\u2019s Carlos Hyde.\n\nc. Not often that players, even departed ones, rip their team. That\u2019s why when Orlando Scandrick was cut by the Eagles after the embarrassing loss at Dallas it was surprising (but fun for those on the outside) to see Scandrick tell ESPN: \u201cI still feel like they [the Eagles] are living on that Super Bowl high. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re living in the past.\u201d I\u2019m no shrink, but I bet that helped the locker room. I bet it\u2019s a factor, even a small one, in routing the Bills by 18 on the road.\n\nd. Cooper Kupp, coming off his 220-yard day in London to beat the Bengals, is on pace for 116 catches, 1,584 yards and 10 touchdown receptions. Stunningly, he\u2019s become the Rams\u2019 most valuable receiver.\n\ne. Kirk Cousins, a 78.4 percent passer this month, with one pick and seven sacks taken in his last four games.\n\nf. Great path-clearing block by Green Bay fullback Danny Vitale on the one-yard touchdown plunge by Jamaal Williams in the first quarter Sunday night at Kansas City.\n\ng. Everyone thought Kyle Shanahan would build a passing offense to break records, and he may still do that. But he wanted to be absolutely sure his team could run first and foremost, because running games can work in any weather, at any time of year. So kudos to the Niners for building a good one, and kudos to Tevin Coleman, the 26-year-old free-agent back via Atlanta, for playing the best football of his pro life right now. Sunday, he rushed 11 times for 105 yards, scoring three times on the ground, once on a short pass.\n\nh. Murray to Kirk to Murray to Clay, 47 yards. You\u2019ve got to see it.\n\ni. That seeing-ghosts thing really paralyzed Sam Darnold. First possession in Jacksonville: seven of seven, 86 yards, TD pass.\n\nj. Saquon Barkley is so gifted, and so strong. He gets so many yards after first contact.\n\nk. Nice 51-yard save by Adam Vinatieri in Indianapolis, with the winning field goal over Denver. And good to see him rally after missing wide right with a 45-yarder and a PAT, hitting from 55 and 45 to keep Indy in it.\n\nl. A wow for Christian McCaffrey. At 2:58 p.m. PT, he scored the first touchdown from scrimmage by a 49ers opposing running back, with a 40-yard sprint through the defense.\n\nm. Great brotherhood move by Bucs players Jameis Winston, Donovan Smith, Lavonte David and Mike Evans, attending the Senior Night game of former teammate Gerald McCoy\u2019s son, Marcellus Crutchfield, while McCoy and his Carolina teammates were traveling to San Francisco for a game. McCoy played nine seasons for the Bucs before moving to Carolina in free agency this off-season, and his impact, clearly, left devoted teammates wanting to stand in for an absentee dad. \u201cMy brothers stepped in for me,\u201d McCoy said on Instagram.\n\nn. Great effort by Pats running back James White of the Patriots, setting up New England\u2019s third-quarter TD pass to Julian Edelman with a 59-yard romp on a pass from Tom Brady.\n\no. Great effort by Pats right tackle right tackle Marcus Cannon, erasing Myles Garrett to free Brady to be able to throw the touchdown pass to Edelman. That was some great rasslin\u2019 by Cannon.\n\np. Most-shown assistant coach on TV in the last three weeks: San Francisco defensive coordinator Robert Saleh. It\u2019s not close.\n\nq. Great point by Charles Davis on Giants-Lions on FOX: Darius Slayton, rookie receiver, has good chemistry with Daniel Jones, rookie QB, because in camp backups have more experience playing with backups, and they both were backups. Seems almost too easy, but it\u2019s true.\n\nr. Kicking Thursday night: Dan Bailey and Dustin Hopkins were 7-of-7 in field goals, 1-of-1 in PATs. Twenty-two of 28 points were scored from feet.\n\n2. I think this is what I did not like about Week 8:\n\na. Baker Mayfield, who underhanded the ball to Lawrence Guy of the Patriots.\n\nThis INT by Baker Mayfield was the Browns' third turnover \u2026 in the FIRST QUARTER \ud83d\ude33 (via @NFL) pic.twitter.com/ZYCS64Sw86 \u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 27, 2019\n\nb. The Browns, turning the ball over on three straight offensive snaps.\n\nc. For a smart veteran like Matthew Stafford to throw the interception he threw in the first quarter\u2014trying to force it into double-coverage in the red zone, and Janoris Jenkins making the easiest pick of his life\u2014is stupefying. How does he not see the two cover guys, with his own receiver shackled? I\u2019ll forgive\u2014he made some superb throws to beat the Giants, and has 16 touchdown passes in seven games.\n\nd. I get the truly dumb play by Giants QB Daniel Jones on the ensuing series, waiting so long to throw that by the time he got rid of it he was jarred by Jarrad David into throwing a backward pass, and it was picked up and run in for a touchdown by Devon Kennard. For such a smart player, it\u2019s taking a while for Jones to realize he can lose games by his refusal to throw the ball away or to dump it off. Think of how gigantic that mistake was for Jones: In a 0-0 game, Giants pick off Stafford near the goal line \u2026 Giants, from the 29-yard line, on a first down, have Saquon Barkley open in the flat \u2026 Jones waits, waits, gets smashed by Davis and throws the lateral fumble \u2026 Detroit gets an easy TD. Minutes later the Lions score again. It\u2019s 14-0. Jones had some good moments in Detroit, but he has to play smarter than that. Consistently.\n\ne. What a dumb roughing-the-passer by Denver\u2019s Mike Purcell, giving the Colts, touchdown-less to that point in the third quarter, new life in the red zone. Marlon Mack ran it in after that for Indy\u2019s only TD of the day.\n\nf. Ten players on the field for Cleveland on a fourth-and-seven, causing the Browns to burn a timeout. Come on.\n\ng. Derrick Henry, Titans back, fumbling without the ball being hit, and without being contacted hard, with Tennessee leading Tampa Bay 17-15 in the third quarter. A bizarre fumble. It could have cost Tennessee the game. Lucky for Henry it didn\u2019t.\n\nh. Keenan Allen, Chargers wide receiver. Chargers trailing 16-10, fourth quarter, 11 minutes left. Third-and-14 at the Chicago 24-yard line. Philip Rivers throws to the end zone, to a covered Allen. The ball is over the defender, perfectly laid into Allen\u2019s hands. And through his hands. Allen dropped it. It could have cost L.A. the game. Lucky for Allen it didn\u2019t.\n\ni. Denzel Ward, dropping a Tom Brady pick in the end zone.\n\nj. Joel Bitonio, weirdly, kicking the ball out of Nick Chubb\u2019s hands and handing Dont\u2019a Hightower a walk-in touchdown.\n\nk. Nick Chubb has to work on not fumbling.\n\nl. Oof, Broncos, who have now lost on a 53-yard field goal on the last play of the game (Week 2, Bears), and a 51-yard field goal with 22 seconds left (Week 8, Colts).\n\nm. Quite a week for Sam Darnold: seven days, seven interceptions \u2026 though his line is doing him zero favors.\n\nn. In two weeks, the Seahawks have lost two important starters for the season to injuries: tight end Will Dissly and center Justin Britt.\n\no. If it was remotely clean, I\u2019d post the irrational ravings of Barstool\u2019s Dave Portnoy about RedZone host Scott Hanson. If Portnoy bet on the Rams, he\u2019d have said nothing. But he apparently bet on the Bengals, and was two points away from covering, and took it out on Hanson. What a jerk.\n\n3. I think if I were the Jags, as painful as it it\u2019d be for Nick Foles, I\u2019d stick with Gardner Minshew when Foles is healthy enough to return from his dislocated shoulder. Just look at the scramble/presence/keeping eyes downfield of Minshew, when he found Chris Conley for a 70-yard touchdown. You\u2019ve got to be mobile, with confidence, and a great sense of where you are to make that play. Those are the traits we\u2019ve seen in Minshew for six weeks.\n\n4. I think this two-play sequence from Chargers-Bears is why, regardless of the outcome Sunday, I still think\u2014as I wrote last Monday\u2014it would be best now for Chicago to play Chase Daniel and let Mitchell Trubisky watch for a while:\n\n\u2022 Second quarter, 4:52 left, second-and-goal from the Chargers\u2019 9-yard line. Wide receiver Allen Robinson, from the left, runs a quick slant to the middle of the field and is open at the 2. The throw from Trubisky is behind Robinson, and he misses it, lunging acrobatically backward trying to catch it. An awful throw.\n\n\u2022 Third-and-goal from the 9. Trubisky hands to Tarik Cohen, who tries to run left and finds no hole. Gain of two. Coach Matt Nagy trusts his quarterback so little right now that he calls a sweep from the nine on third-and-goal. \u201cThis offense is just painful to watch the past couple of weeks,\u201d Thom Brennaman said on FOX.\n\nNo one wants to pile on Trubisky, but the Bears have so little confidence in him that Matt Nagy dismissed any thought of trying to get closer than a 41-yard field goal to win even though Chicago had a timeout and 43 seconds to get closer.\n\n5. I think the Browns, who played the first half like a scared and totally unprepared team at New England, are lucky to be 2-5.\n\n6. I think there\u2019s a good reason why Cincinnati is 0-8 and Washington 1-7 at the season\u2019s midpoint. The two teams are stuck. They do what they do because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve done. The game is changing, and they are not changing with it. The league has embraced trading much more than in the past, but not in Washington and Cincinnati. Look at what these two franchises should do, and why they probably won\u2019t do it:\n\n\u2022 Cincinnati should trade 31-year-old wide receiver A.J. Green, but Ian Rapoport reported Sunday on NFL Network the Bengals likely will not. Green is 31. He gets hurt a lot. He\u2019s missed 21 games in the last four years, including all eight this season with a knee injury. He\u2019s 31. What the Bengals should do is ask for a second-round pick this year, or a second that could rise to a first in 2021 if Green hits certain numbers or plays in X games in the 2020 season. Say the Bengals draft a quarterback high next year, one of the three studs set to come out in the draft. By the time that QB is ready for prime time, if he\u2019s good, Green will be 32 or 33. Smart teams read the tea leaves and get value for a declining player. The Bengals have a day and a half to see the light, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.\n\n\u2022 Washington should trade 31-year-old left tackle Trent Williams, but there\u2019s no indication club czar Bruce Allen will move off the spot of hanging on to a player who despises the franchise and says he won\u2019t report. Williams has held out all year, angry at what he feels is poor medical treatment by the team. But he is a distressed asset for not just missing eight games this year; he missed 13 games due to injury over the previous three seasons. Who would look at Williams, cross his arms, hold his breath and say, I don\u2019t care! We\u2019re not trading Williams! Apparently, Bruce Allen. It is so nonsensical.\n\n7. I think the coolest byplay in my half-hour NBC Sports Network show last week of Patrick Mahomes, Andy Reid and Brett Favre watching tape of the highlights of the two quarterbacks happened when a 1996 Favre play in Seattle came up. What followed:\n\nMe: \u201cThis is the Kingdome.\u201d\n\nFavre to Mahomes: \u201cDo you even know what the Kingdome is?\u201d\n\nMahomes: \u201cUh, no.\u201d\n\nMahomes seemed to get some ideas from a few of the circus plays by Favre. \u201cThese are definitely things that will come out in the future,\u201d Mahomes said. And Reid wanted to make sure each guy know how great the coach thought they were. \u201cYou come across like the country bumpkin,\u201d he said at one point to Favre. \u201cBut both of you are so innately smart, it comes easy. You want more and more. That creativity is what makes [each guy] so special.\u201d\n\nA clip from the show (unfortunately, we can\u2019t show NFL video on our website per league rules):\n\n8. I think there is so much about the Kelechi Osemele-versus-Jets we can\u2019t know, and don\u2019t know. But at its base, Osemele says he was in significant shoulder pain and was tired of taking the mega-painkiller Toradol to mask it so he could keep playing. The Jets disagreed with Osemele\u2019s characterization of the severity of the injury. Last week, Osemele chose to have the shoulder fixed by an independent surgeon, ending his season. The Jets fired Osemele. Having admitted there is much that we don\u2019t know, I think I would have to see overwhelming evidence in the Jets\u2019 favor to side with them. Asking a player to mask the pain of a torn labrum with painkillers and continue playing? That should not be a part of the NFL\u2014even though I know many players do it.\n\n9. I think I\u2019m bothered by the Jets making such a big deal out of the \u201cseeing ghosts\u201d line put on TV by ESPN last Monday. Okay, in an ideal world, do you want your quarterback confessing that the defense has him all messed up? No. But when you lose 33-0 and look hopeless and hapless in the process, then Adam Gase says the next the organization is quite upset about it, my first reaction was Gase is trying to deflect from the real story of the night\u2014the Patriots making the Jets look unprofessional and totally unprepared. Gase\u2019s better reaction would have been something like:\n\nI\u2019ve got my own opinions about what was aired on ESPN, and I\u2019ll address those with the proper authorities. But today\u2019s not a day to be concentrating on that. We need to take responsibility for how we played, and that starts with me. Anything else today that deflects from the work we have ahead of us on the field is not worthy of our attention.\n\nOne more thing about Gase: Jets at Miami on Sunday, and this is not just an alumni game for the New York coach. This game means nothing except to 2020 draft position and Gase\u2019s rep. Gase is 5-15 in his last 20 games as a head coach, including 1-6 this year, and in the next six weeks he faces Miami twice, the Giants, Washington, Oakland and Cincinnati. If the Jets are anything worse than 3-3 in these games, and if Sam Darnold plays as unevenly as he has in the first half of this season (when he\u2019s played), well, GM Joe Douglas, who didn\u2019t hire Gase, might have some thinking to do about his coach in December.\n\n10. I think these are my other thoughts of the week:\n\na. TV Story of the Week: Erika Edwards of NBC News on the crisis of rural healthcare in America.\n\nb. There is no hospital in Hebron, N.D., an hour west of Bismarck. Edwards: \u201cIn fact, when someone calls 911, there isn\u2019t even a law that requires anyone in Hebron to answer the phone. Like so many other low-income, rural communities across the country, the small town\u2019s ambulance runs on altruism alone. And those ambulance services are closing in record numbers, putting around 60 million Americans at risk of being stranded in a medical emergency.\u201d\n\nc. The head of the town\u2019s all-volunteer ambulance service is the owner of Jack & Jill Grocery in Hebron. He, like everyone in the volunteer service, is not paid. This is so, so, so wrong.\n\nd. TV Story of the Week II: An emotional piece from David Martin of CBS News, on Jack Eaton, the 100-year-old veteran, who returned to the Arlington National Cemetery 80 years after he stood guard over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\ne. \u201cNever will I falter.\u201d The commitment of those who guard the tomb are words to treasure.\n\nf. Nats are 10-4 in playoff games since Bryce Harper left.\n\ng. Impressed with Nolan Ryan who, at 72, and as an adviser to Houston ownership, sat in the front row behind home plate for 4 hours and 1 minute of a (highly painful) 12-3 loss to Washington in Game 2, and, I believe, never left his seat for 241 minutes. Seriously: I kept checking all night, and while Minute Maid Park emptied out, Ryan never left.\n\nh. Not as impressed with ex-Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman.\n\ni. Journalist of the Week: Stephanie Apstein of Sports Illustrated.\n\nj. I am struck by a few things, a week after Apstein detailed in a story released last Monday how Taubman seemed to taunt three female reporters after the Astros won the American League title over the Yankees\u2014which prompted the Astros to put out a statement categorically denying the story and impugning Apstein and her reporting. The team said she attempted \u201cto fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d Now we know that it was Taubman who fabricated the fabrication and was fired for it, and slunk away from the organization in disgrace.\n\nk. Question: What would have happened last Monday, when Apstein asked the organization for comment and to interview Taubman, if he simply said this, \u201cI am sorry for my actions in the clubhouse Saturday night. I want to apologize to Apstein and the two other journalists for making them feeling uncomfortable and for acting inappropriately,\u201d and if he then offered a personal apology to Apstein and the two other reporters. If Taubman did all of that, aside from it being the right thing to do, I bet this would have been a minor story, all but forgotten by midday Tuesday, the first day of the World Series. Instead, the story was huge on Tuesday, simmering and still out there on Wednesday, huge when Taubman was fired Thursday, and dominant in the morning papers and websites on Friday, the day of Game 3. It\u2019s Taubman, and the Astros, who made all of this happen.\n\nl. Truth is always the best policy. Most often, it\u2019s not the lie that gets you. It\u2019s the denial. It\u2019s the coverup.\n\nm. Good work, of course, by Stephanie Apstein. Future generation of journalists, female and male, in and out of sports, will read about and appreciate your reporting and your ability to stand in and take the heat.\n\nn. My favorite line connected to the Apstein story came from Friday\u2019s New York Times: \u201cWhen asked for comment on Thursday, Apstein said she wanted her reporting to speak for itself.\u201d\n\no. Column of the Week: Tara Sullivan of the Boston Globe, on Yankees veteran broadcaster Suzyn Waldman refusing to watch the World Series because of the Astros\u2019 attempt to smear Apstein.\n\np. If you are not a person of a certain age, the song on this TV ad might be a mystery to you.\n\nq. \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d might also be the song you absolutely, positively cannot get out of your head. It was released in 1967, when I was 10, by Jefferson Airplane. I listened to it over and over, wondering what in the heck it was, and whatever in the world these psychedelic drugs meant, and what they made you feel like. Go ask Alice, when she\u2019s 10 feet tall. Whaaaaaat? Grace Slick, with the alluring vocals. Songs were short then\u2014this was two and a half minutes\u2014and I got the single and wore it out on the King family record player. We had a small house in Connecticut, and I don\u2019t remember whether it was \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d or the Monkees, or some Beatles record, but I do recall in those years my father setting a record for yelling \u201cTURN IT DOWN!\u201d and \u201cSHUT THE DOOR!\u201d Then through the years, you\u2019d read about Grace Slick. She had a Winehouse sort of debacle on a 1978 European tour and was too drunk to perform one night, and went in and out of rehab, and went on to more pop-type hits (\u201cNothing\u2019s Gonna Stop Us Now\u201d), and was friends with Abbie Hoffman, and was an inspiration for lots of latter-day female vocalists, and I hadn\u2019t heard much of her in the last 20 years\u2014until this ad popped up. I couldn\u2019t get \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d out of my head. Still can\u2019t.\n\nr. I bring this up now because Wednesday is Grace Slick\u2019s 80th birthday. I kinda/sorta think she won\u2019t read these happy-birthday wishes, but man, she\u2019s packed in a lot of life in those 80 years. Happy birthday from a fan.\n\ns. Back to reality. Well, my reality.\n\nt. College Football Story of the Week: Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports on Ohio State defensive end Chase Young, who might be the best player in college football (and sure looked like it Saturday with a four-sack game against Wisconsin).\n\nu. Thamel\u2019s so good at these. I\u2019ll never forget his piece on Stanford QB Andrew Luck before we all really knew him, riding his bike around campus anonymously, absolutely loving the anonymous part. Chase Young, starting at 7, had to wash his own laundry and by 10 had to pack his own school lunch. The detail work in here is so good.\n\nv. Joe Buck\u2019s world, starting last Tuesday: World Series Game 1 (Houston), World Series Game 2 (Houston), Washington at Minnesota NFL game, World Series Game 3 (at Washington), World Series Game 4 (Washington), World Series Game 5 (Washington). Today he has a bye. Tuesday: World Series Game 6 (Houston). Wednesday, if necessary: World Series Game 7 (Houston). Thursday: San Francisco at Arizona NFL game (Glendale, Ariz.)\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\n\u2022 Tuesday: The trading deadline. So far, 59 trades involving players in 2019 (up 51 percent over the total in 2009), with 15 Pro Bowl players having moved so far. Best guess as of this morning: Cincinnati WR A.J. Green stays, Denver CB Chris Harris Jr. goes, Jets DL Leonard Williams goes, Miami RB Kenyan Drake goes (for peanuts; he is worth more), Washington LT Trent Williams stays (stupidly).\n\n\u2022 Thursday: Glendale, Ariz., Niners at Cards, 8:20 p.m. ET. First of two meetings between the teams in 18 days, and we\u2019re about to find out how good San Francisco is. Not that the Cards are the biggest challenge; just a different one, with a surprisingly good run game and a quarterback who can make people miss. Niners\u2019 next six: at Arizona, Seattle, Arizona, Green Bay, at Baltimore, at New Orleans. Man, those last two.\n\n\u2022 Sunday: Baltimore, Patriots at Ravens, 8:20 p.m. ET. Odd that two prominent teams in the same conference would have met just one time in the regular season in the last six years: a 30-23 Patriots win in 2016 in Foxboro. Bill Belichick grew up 34 miles from the site of M&T Bank Stadium, the Ravens\u2019 home, in Annapolis, and he has deep ties to Maryland. Just odd his Patriots have played in Baltimore twice since 2007. I\u2019d bet that Belichick has been to Baltimore more for lacrosse games than football games since 2007. Tough duty for the 8-0 Pats, with the 5-2 Ravens on such a good run and having the benefit of playing at home coming off the bye.\n\nThe Adieu Haiku 20\n\nCleveland.
