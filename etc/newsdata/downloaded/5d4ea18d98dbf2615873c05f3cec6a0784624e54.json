Appearing in the original 1984 film and 1986\u2019s The Karate Kid Part II, Garrison helped round out the menacing blonde Cobra Kai dojo villains who squared off against the series\u2019s titular hero, Daniel, played by Ralph Macchio, and coached to victory by Pat Morita\u2019s Mr. Miyagi.\n\nFollowing turns in Brubaker, St. Elsewhere, and MacGyver, among other television roles, Garrison returned this year to the role of Tommy in the YouTube Premium show Cobra Kai, which takes place at the Cobra Kai dojo decades after the events of the earlier films. It focuses on Daniel, his main rival Johnny Lawrence, and the other now-adult pupils that battled Daniel for karate supremacy at the start of the franchise.\n\n\u201cRob was a great person and ambassador to The Karate Kid legacy,\u201d Garrison\u2019s rep, Rick Henriques, told CNN on Friday. \u201cHis performance in Season 2 of Cobra Kai, being his last, was simply amazing and he stole the episode. He will be missed by me and everyone he encountered.\u201d", "description": "Actor Rob Garrison, who appeared as Tommy in The Karate Kid, The Karate Kid Part II and the follow-up webseries Cobra Kai, has died at the age of 59.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/27-Robert-Garrison.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
