And he was expected to sit down with Mr. Trump at 2:15 p.m., even as details about the July 25 call were revealed publicly.\n\nAt the center of the controversy surrounding Mr. Trump is whether he pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden and whether Mr. Trump directed the United States to withhold aid for Ukraine until Mr. Zelensky agreed to his demands.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday with Voice of America, Mr. Zelensky said that he expected the conversation on Wednesday afternoon to be \u201cvery warm\u201d and that he respected Mr. Trump. \u201cWe just want the U.S. to always support Ukraine and Ukraine\u2019s course in its fight against aggression and war,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said. \u201cIt seems to me that it is so.\u201d\n\nTrump will hold an afternoon news conference in New York.\n\nMr. Trump will face reporters in a formal news conference Wednesday afternoon, providing a high-profile forum for questions about his role in the telephone call with Ukraine\u2019s president that is at the center of the Democratic impeachment effort.\n\nPresidents historically hold a formal news conference at the end of the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Often, such events are a president\u2019s primary opportunity to shape the perception of their actions during the meetings with world leaders.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s case, the news conference is likely to be one of many opportunities for the president to make his views known. He typically will respond to questions from reporters throughout the day, before and after bilateral discussions with world leaders. And, of course, the president started tweeting his thoughts about the Democrats first thing Wednesday morning.", "description": "As the House begins a formal impeachment inquiry, the White House prepares to release the transcript of President Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s leader.", "authors": ["Michael D.
