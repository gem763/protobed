Then [Rep. Adam] Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress. \u2026\u201d\n\nShortly after, Trump again tweeted this: \u201c\u2026 In addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u2018Whistleblower.\u2019 Was this person SPYING on the U.S. [p]resident? Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nYet CNN drummed up the hysteria and painted Trump\u2019s call as threatening.\n\n\u201cTrump,\u201d one CNN report read, \u201cescalated his attacks on the whistleblower \u2014 demanding to meet his \u2018accuser\u2019 face to face during a day of rage-filled tweets about the Democratic attempt to impeach him.\u201d\n\nNBC followed suit.\n\n\u201cWhistleblower\u2019s lawyer says Trump is endangering his client,\u201d by calling for \u201c\u2018the person who gave the whistleblower the information\u2019 to be publicly identified,\u201d the news outlet wrote.\n\nAnd from The Guardian, this: \u201cTrump lashes out at whistleblower and renews attack on House intelligence chair.\u201d\n\nThe point is this: So freaking what?\n\nYes, whistleblowers have their protected rights to whistle-blow. But there are limits to what accusers can accuse, based on hearsay, while keeping their identities in the dark. Americans deserve truth in justice, not question marks about motives.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for his accuser to come forward isn\u2019t just human nature \u2014 really, it\u2019s what anybody in his position would do. But it\u2019s also based on U.S. law. It\u2019s also based on long-held and admirable notions of U.S. justice that give the accused the right to know who\u2019s doing the accusing \u2014 so ultimately, the why\u2019s of the accusations can be discerned.\n\nSo ultimately, the innocence or guilt of the accused, as well as the motivations of the accuser, might be exposed.\n\nThe fact that some actually find controversy in Trump\u2019s demand to know the identity of his accuser just shows how far this nation\u2019s straying from its most basic of constitutional protections, and also, sadly, despicably, how willing some are to trade short-term political wins for the long-term sustainability of America.\n\nIf we can\u2019t manage to navigate today\u2019s hot political climates without decimating crucial freedoms in the process, without killing the basic concepts of U.S. justice, America will soon enough reach a time when the political parties of officeholders won\u2019t matter at all.\n\n\u201cThe presumption of innocence is deeply rooted in our nation\u2019s history and tradition, such that it is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d attorneys with the Institute for Justice wrote in filings before the U.S. Supreme Court, \u201cShannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden v. Colorado.\u201d\n\nPrecisely. Without rule of law, without regard for rule of law, America will crumble.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
