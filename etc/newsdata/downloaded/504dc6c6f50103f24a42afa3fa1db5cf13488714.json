But here\u2019s one reason to pick up the phone: you may find the creditor or collector is willing to negotiate.\n\nDebt collectors tend to buy debts for pennies on the dollar, which means they don\u2019t need to recoup the full amount you owe to reap a profit. As such, there\u2019s a chance one will agree to a settlement. Creditors, too, may be good with reaching an agreement, since the alternative is to write the debt off as a loss.\n\nOf course, there are some best practices when it comes to debt negotiation, including explaining your current money situation, taking notes, and obtaining written confirmation of any settlement you do reach.\n\nHere are 10 tips for negotiating with creditors and collection agencies.\n\n1. Stick to your story\n\nThe person on the other end of the phone doesn\u2019t want to hear all the details about why you\u2019re not able to pay your bills. However, they do need to know if you are in a hardship situation and what you are trying to do to get back on track.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to come up with a few sentences that you can use consistently when you talk with creditors.\n\nThese sentences could include:\n\n\u201cI was very ill, out of work for two months, and now I am trying to get caught up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife was laid off, and I\u2019ve taken a significant cut in pay. She\u2019s looking for a job so we can catch up, but we don\u2019t have any money to pay right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy interest rates have doubled, and I can no longer keep up. I am meeting with a bankruptcy attorney to see whether I should file.\u201d\n\nBe truthful. If you tell everyone a different story, especially one that\u2019s not true, it\u2019s bound to backfire.\n\n2. Avoid drama\n\nTry to stay calm, no matter what the person on the other end of the line says. You\u2019ll get nowhere if you lose your temper. If you find yourself losing your cool, just tell the collector you\u2019ll have to talk with them later and hang up. If you need to talk with that representative again, tell them you\u2019d like to record the conversation. That usually keeps them on their best behavior.\n\n3. Ask questions\n\nIf a collector says you\u2019ll be sued, or that you\u2019ll lose property if you don\u2019t pay, just calmly ask for specifics: \u201cWhen can I expect to be notified of this lawsuit?\u201d Or \u201cWhen will you take the money from my bank account?\u201d Some of these threats may be illegal, and the more information you have, the better.\n\nRelated: This 34-year-old paid off $81,000 in student debt, but not before it took a toll on her mental health\n\n4. Take notes\n\nHave a pen and paper handy, so you can take written notes whenever you talk with a collector. Write down the name of the person you talked to, when you talked, and what was discussed. Not only can this help you take the emotion out of the situation, but you\u2019ll also have a record if the creditor or collector broke the law in their attempts to collect.\n\n5. Read (and save) your mail\n\nDon\u2019t throw away mail from your creditors or stuff it in a drawer. Open it, read it, and save it in a file.\n\n6. Know what you can afford\n\nGo over your income and expenses with a fine-tooth comb, figure out what you can afford, and only agree to pay a realistic amount. Generally, you can negotiate the best settlement on a debt if you can come up with a lump sum amount to resolve the debt.\n\nIf you agree to a payment plan, you will likely pay more over time. If you do agree to a payment plan, make sure you understand the total amount you will pay.\n\n7. Deal with creditors, not collectors\n\nIf possible, try to work out an agreement with your creditors before a bill is sent to collections. While late payments affect your credit reports and scores, collection accounts can result in even greater damage.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My husband and I paid off $193,000 in debt \u2014 but now he never wants to take a vacation or socialize with friends\n\nBy the way, it\u2019s a myth that as long as you are paying something toward a debt (even $5 or $10), it can\u2019t be turned over to a collection agency. Once a debt has been sent to collections, you may have no choice but to deal with the collector.\n\n8. Get it in writing\n\nWhen you do come up with a payment arrangement, or a debt settlement letter, get it in writing before you pay a penny. Otherwise, the terms can change, and it will be your word against theirs. We\u2019ve heard of consumers being hounded for balances they thought were resolved years before.\n\n9. Get help when negotiating with creditors\n\nIf you are having trouble coming up with a repayment plan that works, find out whether a credit counseling agency can help you work something out with your creditors. If it is unlikely you\u2019ll be able to pay back your debts, or if debt collectors are hounding you, request a free consultation with a bankruptcy attorney.\n\nEven if you decide not to file, the attorney can tell you what a creditor can and cannot do to collect.\n\n10. Put the past behind you\n\nRemember, catching up on a delinquent account, or paying off a collection account, won\u2019t improve your credit unless you can get the creditor to agree to remove the late payments.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nLate payments can stay on your credit report up to seven years from the original delinquency.\n\ncan stay on your credit report up to seven years from the original delinquency. Charge-offs can remain for up to seven years from the date the creditor wrote the debt off their books as a loss.\n\ncan remain for up to seven years from the date the creditor wrote the debt off their books as a loss. Collections accounts can remain for seven years plus 180 days from the date of the delinquency immediately ahead of the collection activity.\n\nStill, all hope is not lost. Even if it\u2019s not possible to have negative items removed from your credit reports, you can still begin to build better credit as soon as your debts are resolved.\n\nPlus, assuming no new negative information emerges, your score should come back up the further and further you get away for all those original delinquency dates.\n\nShould I settle a debt?\n\nKeep in mind; there are certain ramifications associated with agreeing to a debt settlement that\u2019s less than what you owe. While the exact effects on your credit score will vary, depending on your full credit profile, agreeing to pay less than you originally owed can wind up hurting your scores \u2014 but it still may be your best course of action.\n\nAllowing a debt to go unpaid can lead to further adverse action from your creditor or collector, like a charge off or judgment. And judgments can lead to garnishment of your wages or assets.\n\nRead: How to rebuild your credit\u2014fast\n\nPlus, paid collection accounts sometimes weigh less heavily on your credit scores (depending on the credit score model) than unpaid account, especially in the long term. In fact, some newer credit scoring models ignore paid collections entirely. So, depending on what you owe and what settlement a creditor or collector proposes, the ends may justify the means.\n\nNegotiating with different types of creditors\n\nYou will find that there are several different types of creditors you have to deal with when it comes to finding a good way to settle your debt. The following are a few of these creditor types and some other useful information you can carry with you into negotiations.\n\n-Negotiating student loans\n\nYou will find that it may be difficult to negotiate when it comes to student loan debt. Therefore, you should consider government programs that will allow you to reduce your monthly payments, extend the repayment length, or cancel some or all of the debt completely.\n\n-Negotiating with mortgage companies\n\nThere are home loan modifications that can help you with monthly payments if you find that you are struggling to keep up or pay what you need to pay. These modifications may be a great solution to finding a way to free up some money for your living expenses.\n\n-Negotiating secured loans\n\nIt is easier for you to negotiate a secured loan over an unsecured loan because the debt has already been secured with collateral. For this type of negotiation, you can lead with bankruptcy if that is the case, have the funds available to make a payment, and focus on the bigger picture; the debt needs to be paid, so how can you negotiate payment?\n\n-Negotiating with credit card companies\n\nNegotiating a credit card debt settlement has to be one of the easiest debts that you can negotiate. However, it is still going to take some time to reach a reasonable and comfortable settlement amount agreed upon by yourself and the credit card company. All of the negotiation tactics listed above would be good for this type of negotiation.\n\nConsult with a credit counselor\n\nIf you find that you have tried all of the tips we have included, but you are not making any progress or are unsure of the steps you need to take for a specific creditor negotiation, it could be in your best interest to seek the services of a credit counselor.\n\nA credit counselor can help individuals throughout the negotiation and debt settlement process while also educating them about the tools that are available to help them reduce and eliminate their debt.", "description": "They may agree to a settlement.
