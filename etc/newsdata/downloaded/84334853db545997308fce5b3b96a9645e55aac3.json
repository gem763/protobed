One, called \u201cHow I Style My Beard,\u201d has more than 2.9 million views. His message is self-effacing and surprisingly relatable. Though he sports a stunning beard, he reminds viewers that he wasn\u2019t able to grow it until he was about 50. He refers to his beard as a \u201ccomb-over,\u201d meaning it achieves its gloriously dense appearance only once it has reached a certain length. Many beards are that way. \u201cI think people look up to me as a father figure,\u201d Berzinsky said when I called him recently. \u201cI get a lot of people asking for advice. And then because my beard came in late, I offer hope to a lot of guys who have weaker beards maybe in their 20s.\u201d\n\nBerzinsky sometimes makes videos with his son, Victor, 22, who can grow a dense chinstrap and sideburns but not much on his upper lip. \u201cI cannot grow my father\u2019s famous handlebar mustache, which is kind of surprising to both of us,\u201d he says in an early video. It\u2019s okay, though; Victor works with what he has. He got a retro sideburn trim from his dad on camera, and later a barber helped him rock a Wolverine-style look (also on camera). Now commenters on his Instagram call him Logan, after the X-Men character. His father loves it. The internet, Greg told me, has given men the freedom to talk about grooming. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being masculine. It\u2019s almost clinical,\u201d he said. \u201cI have that car, and I have this beard. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re less a man because you spend five minutes on your beard.\u201d\n\nIf straight, cisgender men do feel more comfortable with blow-dryers and cleansers and creams, credit is at least partially due to Jeff Falberg, who started Beard Board 18 years ago. Falberg, alias \u201cthe Goatee King,\u201d is a 54-year-old dad in Bridgeport, Connecticut, whose passions include video games and long-distance running. A software engineer, he recently returned to work after two years out of a job. On the phone, he comes across as soft-spoken and almost frustratingly modest. \u201cWe just want people to be happy, and try to help them with what they want to achieve,\u201d he said.\n\nThe story of Beard Board starts with a costume. Falberg, who had long worn a mustache, decided to dress up for Halloween as Mark McGwire, the electrifying slugger for the St. Louis Cardinals. The costume called for a goatee. Halloween parties came and went, but the new look remained, and it kept filling in. At a certain point, Falberg posted pictures to a now-defunct site called Beard and Mustache Oasis. \u201cI was encouraged by the friendliness of the people there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey encouraged me to keep going. I\u2019d say 20 years after the fact, I\u2019m still happy with what I have.\u201d\n\nFalberg calls Beard Board \u201cmore of a hobby than anything.\u201d He\u2019s not as actively engaged with the forum as he once was, letting his staff of volunteer moderators and administrators (with honorific titles such as Beard Wizard, Beard Legend, and Beard Titan) keep it running. The site, which sits on a platform called Tapatalk, hosts ads but hardly makes any money, Falberg told me. He said it receives an average of 150 new posts and comments a day\u2014not a huge number, but not nothing. As we spoke, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why he hadn\u2019t turned Beard Board into a full-time gig\u2014upgrading the website, promoting products, turning a profit. He deflected, saying he didn\u2019t have the time or the energy, at least not as a solo entrepreneur. \u201cFamily seems to come first,\u201d he said.", "description": "Beard Board offers a rare avenue for constructive aesthetic feedback among men\u2014minus the machismo that often accompanies it.", "authors": ["William Alden"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/Beards/facebook.jpg?1569860402", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
