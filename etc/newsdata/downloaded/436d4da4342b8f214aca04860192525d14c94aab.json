Instead, his candidacy is likely to be dedicated to the issues that have motivated and impassioned him for years \u2014 particularly issues related to fiscal restraint and responsibility. He happens to be on the right side of those issues, and the president on the wrong side. Also unlike Mr. Walsh, Mr. Sanford is not in the race to give Never Trumpers a home, nor to instinctively, reflexively oppose the president or \u201cstick it to him.\u201d Indeed, on some issues he will probably agree with him, and not in a tokenist way.\n\nUnlike Mr. Weld, Mr. Sanford has been a big-name player and an elected official in Republican politics in the Trump era, the Tea Party-dominated period that preceded it and the two decades before that. He remains beloved by many conservative activists, who know he\u2019s been serious about reining in wasteful spending, targeting debt and the deficit, and supporting free trade. They remember when he brought squealing piglets to the state house to make a point about \u201cpork\u201d spending. They know he got As and Bs from the Cato Institute for his fiscal record as governor. They know he has a lifetime 93 percent grade from the Club for Growth (which is better than the House Freedom caucus chairman Mark Meadows\u2019s lifetime grade). And they regard him as having had about the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history (he had an extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman).\n\nThat, collectively, could make him dangerous \u2014 an irony for a candidate who doesn\u2019t seem intent on damaging Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanford really just wants to bring focus to a few big topics and provide some comfort to fellow Republicans who don\u2019t revile the president or even disagree with him on most things but who fret about the national debt and the effects of a trade war, the way most Republicans used to.\n\nHow many of those voters are there? If the era of Trump has shown us anything, it\u2019s that Republicans talk a good game about debt and deficits, but when given control of the House, the Senate and the White House, they will pile them up just about as badly, and maybe worse, than a Democratic House, Senate and president would.\n\nIt has also shown us that Republicans really do follow their leader \u2014 validating the comment that the MSNBC host Chris Matthews has been known to make that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line. But conservative elites who loved Mr. Sanford in 2008, or 2010, or 2012 right through his narrow 2018 primary loss to Katie Arrington, a more Trumpy candidate, will be hard-pressed to dump him now.", "description": "He is unlikely to be defined by Never Trumpism and more likely to campaign on the threat of runaway deficits and debts.", "authors": ["Liz Mair"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/opinion/09Mair/09Mair-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
