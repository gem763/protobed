Another of the dogs, Roxy, seven, was underweight.\n\nRSPCA officer Helen Mead visited the property numerous times between December 2018 and May 2019.\n\nProsecutor Richard Purchase said: 'There was a worry at that time that two dogs were underweight. Molly, 14, was thin and Roxy, seven, was underweight. Advice was given that the dogs needed cooked pasta into their dog food and should be taken to the vets.'\n\nBy March the dogs had not been taken to the vets because Wood said they were 'very busy'.\n\nThe RSPCA inspector attended their home twice that month but could not gain access.\n\nIn May, a police officer attended the property with Ms Mead who had 'concerns regarding the state of two dogs'. Bear was found lethargic with protruding hip bones and another dog in the home was 'grumbling' and 'had scabs'.\n\nThe cruel couple left their dogs to starve for months and did not take them to the vets\n\nMr Purchase said: 'The fear was that it had a fight with one of the other dogs. The scratches were deep and the dog had not had any treatment.\n\n'Mr Wood said the dogs were fed a lot of food. Ms Mead asked there was any dog food but Mr Wood said no.\n\n'The concern was that the dogs were not being fed on dog food but scrap food from the local takeaway. It would appear the dogs were so thin because of their diet. All four dogs were seized.'\n\nWood owned three of the dogs while Butt owned Bear. All four dogs are still with the RSPCA.\n\nDefending Wood, Mark Moore said the couple have become 'village pariahs' in Draycott and even the local shop won't serve them.\n\nThe Chair of the Bench said: 'These cases are always difficult. That said, whilst we fully respect how the RSPCA brought this case, we and they will have seen much worse cases.\n\n'That is not to minimise the distress you have caused these four dogs. You were incompetent in the care you provided. We also impose a deprivation order for the four dogs.'\n\nThe magistrate imposed a fine of \u00a380 per defendant, a victim surcharge of \u00a330 each and RSPCA costs of \u00a3400 collectively. Each defendant was charged \u00a3310 each.\n\nBoth defendants were also disqualified from keeping any dogs for the next three years.", "description": "Laura Butt, 33, and Timothy Wood, 53, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/10/19684040-0-image-a-6_1571044907019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
