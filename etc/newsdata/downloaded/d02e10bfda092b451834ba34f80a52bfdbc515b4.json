There they found extreme political manipulation of the lines similar to what voters suing over the congressional map also say occurred.\n\nIn the ruling Monday, the judges \u2014 Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite \u2014 agreed that \"there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders\" in violation of the North Carolina Constitution.\n\nThe judges gave no date by which a new map must be drawn, but suggested lawmakers could redraw them on their own quickly to ensure congressional primaries be held as scheduled. The State Board of Elections has said lines needed to be finalized by December 15.\n\nRepublican state legislators made plain when they drew that map that the lines were designed to help the GOP retain 10 of the state's 13 congressional seats, but argued such strategies weren't unlawful. Republican defendants in the lawsuit and three sitting GOP U.S. House members opposed the injunction request.\n\nA map is shown as a three-judge panel of the Wake County Superior Court presides over the trial of Common Cause, et al. v.

The lawsuit is being bankrolled by a national Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nDemocratic and unaffiliated voters who sued September 27 sought the injunction before any trial is held on their partisan gerrymandering claims. They said the case was extremely similar to the successful lawsuit over state legislative districts.\n\nThe same three judges hearing the congressional case ruled in that case just two months ago, finding Republicans performed extreme political manipulation in those maps to ensure they could hold majorities in almost any political environment. Republicans were ordered to redraw those lines.\n\nThe lawsuit challenging North Carolina's map is being bankrolled by a national Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder.

But the justices left the door open for state courts to intervene.\n\nOpponents of the current congressional map have latched on to the comment made by state Representative David Lewis during the 2016 remapping. Lewis said at the time he was proposing a 10-3 map \"because I do not believe it's possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\" Lewis said later he was joking.\n\nAttorneys for Lewis and other Republican lawmakers who are defendants in the state congressional lawsuit case reject the plaintiffs' partisan gerrymandering claims. They told the judges it was too late to make congressional map changes, since candidate filing begins in early December and that facts in the case were not settled. Changes now, the GOP's lawyers said, would result in voter confusion and extremely low turnout should the primary have to be delayed.", "description": "When Republican state legislators drew the map, they openly discussed how the lines were drawn to help the GOP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/fec1313a-0c99-47d6-ace7-19db8542a46c/thumbnail/1200x630/90d1df692352c468c14e7519e60815fa/ap-19207752856179.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
