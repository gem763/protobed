He later was signed by the Astros.\n\nAlthough his criminal case later was dropped after the alleged victim went to Mexico and refused to testify against him, Osuna was suspended for 75 games by Major League Baseball.\n\nThe Astros originally had called Sports Illustrated's article \"misleading and completely irresponsible,\" claiming that Taubman had spoken only after \"being asked questions about a difficult outing.\"\n\n\"Our executive was supporting the player during the difficult time,\" the Astros said at the time. \"His comments had everything to do with the game situation that just occurred and nothing else \u2014 they were also not directed toward any specific reporters.\"\n\nThe Astro's denials were soon disputed by other reporters who had witnessed Taubman's outburst.\n\nAnd Taubman's reported words about Osuna made little or no sense in the context of the game because he had given up a two-run homer to the Yankees in the top of the ninth inning, putting the team at risk of a loss until second baseman Jose Altuve hit a home run later in the inning.\n\nThe Astros currently are down 0-2 in the World Series against the Washington Nationals. The next game is Friday in Washington.\n\nRead the Houston Astros statement:", "description": "The Houston Astros fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman after initially denying claims he taunted female reporters about the signing of Roberto Osuna, a pitcher accused of domestic violence.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106202335-1571951837485gettyimages-1173872322.jpeg?v=1571951857", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
