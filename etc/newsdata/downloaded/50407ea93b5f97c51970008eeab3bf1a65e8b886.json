Check.\n\nPop passes to teammates running in motion in front of him? Check.\n\nTake the snap and search for a crease himself? Check.\n\nSamuels had done it all before. Many times.\n\n\u201cIt was nothing new to me,\u201d Samuels said.\n\nIt did, however, look completely new to the Bengals, who couldn\u2019t seem to figure out how to defend Samuels and backfield mate James Conner as the Steelers pulled away for a 27-3 victory that - momentarily at least - put them back in the thick of the AFC North.\n\nSamuels accounted for 114 total yards and a touchdown. Conner had 125 all-purpose yards and a score and for the first time this season, Pittsburgh\u2019s offense looked potent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be creative,\u201d guard Ramon Foster said. \u201cYou look around the league right now, it\u2019s what teams are doing, spreading you out, going up the middle. That\u2019s where the league is right now, you\u2019ve got to do the same.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the wildcat will become a weekly fixture. After sputtering on the ground through the first three games, offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner and running backs coach Eddie Faulkner needed to come up with something to provide a boost. This week, it was the wildcat.\n\nNext Sunday against Baltimore (2-1), it might be something completely different. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing for a unit trying to find its way without Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nRoethlisberger watched from the sideline with his surgically repaired right arm basically mummified as backup Mason Rudolph won his first game as an NFL starter. Working almost exclusively underneath until a backbreaking 43-yard touchdown heave to rookie wide receiver Dionate Johnson, Rudolph completed 24 of 28 passes for 229 yards and two scores. He received the game ball afterward, but made it a point to praise Fichtner\u2019s unorthodox approach.\n\n\u201cIt is a big switch when you have a guy who has been here for 16 years and likes what he likes and kind of coaches one way and then has the younger guy come in,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201c(Fichtner) has been unbelievably open to suggestions on my end and so we are going to continue to work and continue to gel with this younger group.\u201d\n\nA group that will face another significant test against the Ravens, who will come to Heinz Field smarting after getting kicked around by Cleveland.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nPittsburgh spent the offseason and all of training camp focusing on the importance of having better \u201cball awareness,\u201d code for \u201ccreating turnovers.\u201d It appears to be working. The Steelers have nine takeaways four games into 2019, just six fewer than they had all of last season. Monday night the takeaways came on Bud Dupree\u2019s strip-sack of Cincinnati quarterback Andy Dalton that halted a drive in Pittsburgh territory. The second came in the fourth quarter when linebacker Mark Barron intercepted Dalton in the end zone.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe wide receivers are still having trouble creating separation, which is one of the reasons Rudolph has been reluctant to go down the field. JuJu Smith-Schuster had just three catches for 15 yards, but his presence did create an opportunity for Johnson. Midway through the third quarter, Johnson took off on a post route. He thought he was covered when the coverage slid over to Smith-Schuster, Johnson found himself wide open for a touchdown that put the Bengals away.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nLess than a week after arriving in a trade with Seattle, newly acquired tight end Nick Vannett looked right at home. He caught two passes for 28 yards and pitched in to protect Rudolph, who was not sacked.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nJames Washington. When Rudolph took over the starting gig, the conventional wisdom is that Washington - who played alongside Rudolph at Oklahoma State - would take off. He hasn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t catch a pass on Monday and was only targeted once.\n\nINJURED\n\nTE Vance McDonald (shoulder), LB Vince Williams (hamstring) and LB Anthony Chickillo (foot) could potentially return against the Ravens. DE Cam Heyward (quad) and Conner (ankle) both visited the blue medical tent on Monday night but remained in the game.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n100: the percentage of kicks made by Chris Boswell this season (7 for 7 field goals, 7 for 7 extra points) a year after he made only 65 percent of his field-goal attempts.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nCincinnati\u2019s porous offensive line is one thing. Baltimore\u2019s dynamic offense led by Lamar Jackson is quite another. The Steelers\u2018 aggressiveness will be tested by the second-year Jackson, who did not start in either of Baltimore\u2019s two meetings with Pittsburgh last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jaylen Samuels felt as if he'd jumped into a time machine.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Will Graves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/01/bengals_steelers_football_21758_c0-917-2001-2083_s1770x1032.jpg?0bba03d773e15d5b9f32318ca8e6e250fb4ca368", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
