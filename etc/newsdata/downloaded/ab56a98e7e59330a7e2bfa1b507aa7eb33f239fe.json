Auction fever is back in the capital cities", "language": "en", "text": "My son made a few limited attempts to get into the buying spirit at a much higher price than either he or his partner thought they should make (admittedly urged on by the person standing behind him). But he was quickly trumped by others willing to purchase a modest two-bedroom apartment at a level that would have been considered fantasy several months ago.\n\nYet it\u2019s only earlier this year that the Reserve Bank governor was musing Australians seemed to have moved seamlessly from concern about house prices rising too far to concern they were falling too far. That latter period is now well and truly over. Once again.\n\nThe Treasurer better be prepared for the outbreak of another urgent national conversation about the crisis in housing affordability. Labor may even reverse course \u2013 also once again \u2013 and start to contemplate limited restrictions on negative gearing as it tries to find its way out of its post-election slump.\n\nBusiness may not be investing at record low interest rates, consumers may not be spending much on retail. But house buyers are back as investors look for alternatives to cash or the sharemarket and first-home buyers decide there\u2019s no point \u2013 and considerable risk \u2013 in waiting any longer.\n\nThe debt without growth problem\n\nSo we have arrived back at the familiar Australian pattern. Lowe\u2019s desire to get unemployment down and inflation up through lower rates is rapidly pushing up residential property prices well beyond any realistic definition of \u201cstabilisation\u201d.\n\nAt least my daughter will deign to talk to me again about real estate. Alert readers will recall I persuaded her and her husband to completely overextend themselves to buy a modest red-brick apartment for a heart-palpitating amount just as the market peaked in mid 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter prices then promptly fell for two years, her confidence in my housing market expertise withered and died. My son is now trying to climb onto the same financial roller coaster without falling, having missed the right time by agonising for a few months. Gulp.\n\nBut the problem for the Morrison government and the Reserve Bank \u2013 as well as for would-be home buyers \u2013 is that it\u2019s hard to see how all this adds up. How to hold onto economic safety rails in the context of another surge in household debt levels thanks to rising property prices but without the healthy domestic economic activity that should underpin it?\n\nThe government is still not about to change course and put the budget surplus at risk by spending a lot more itself in coming months.\n\nThat\u2019s why ministers leapt on a slight but unexpected fall in the unemployment rate to 5.2 per cent and Lowe's more optimistic comments about the possibility of the economy returning to higher trend growth over the next year.\n\nThe RBA\u2019s economic optimism has proven consistently misplaced, of course, but Lowe's more confident tone was a useful antidote to the IMF's gloomy prognosis last week. Australia was just one of many countries whose growth figures were downgraded, in part due to the impact of the US-China trade war.\n\nThat has not reduced the clamour for the Australian government to do a lot more, more quickly to stimulate an economy the IMF believes will grow at a decidedly below trend rate of 1.7 per cent this year.\n\nLowe has been repeating his line about the reduced impact of monetary policy encouraging investment and spending activity in this environment even if he now has the RBA cash rate sitting at 0.75 per cent. He still sees little choice but to follow other central banks further down even if the market expects the timing is now delayed for at least another month to December or perhaps next year.\n\nThe hope is the \u201cwealth effect\u201d of the rise may eventually filter through into consumer confidence and purchasing, just as more of the government\u2019s tax cuts may end being spent rather than saved.\n\nBut successfully predicting the timing (just ask me) or the degree is always high risk \u2013 even without Donald Trump. The government wants to wait until the mid-year budget update in December \u2013 and preferably until the May budget \u2013 to judge how the economy is faring. It is accusing Labor of panicking and wanting to repeat a tradition of reckless, wasteful spending by government.\n\nYet if house prices continue to escalate without stimulating much else over the next six months, there will be plenty of panicking around the cabinet table.
