The increased awareness has made our other customers across the country pick up their containers and bring them into our shops.\n\n\" We have seen this working particularly well with people shopping at our meat & fish counters, giving them another option to reduce their plastic waste.\"\n\nWaitrose has also become the first retailer in the country to sell MSC-certified tuna steaks at its counters. While the fish sustainability regulator does not usually recommend people buy tuna steaks, it has endorsed the new product sold by the supermarket.", "description": "Shoppers are ditching plastic packaging and bringing in their own containers for fish, meat and cheese, according to Waitrose figures.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Ruth Dudley Edwards", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Rob Wilson", "Michael Deacon", "Mark Littlewood", "Vernon Bogdanor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000211593158-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
