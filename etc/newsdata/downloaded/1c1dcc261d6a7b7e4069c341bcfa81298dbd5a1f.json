According to developer Maciej Ceglowski, who is better known online as @Pinboard and currently in Hong Kong, said the app saves people's lives and allows them to dodge tear gas.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Twitter account for HKMap Live announced that Apple had rejected its application to appear on the App Store, the only way for iPhone users to download the app.\n\nHKMap Live tweeted: \"Your app contains content - or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity - that is not legal ... Specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement.\" @Apple assume our user are lawbreakers and therefore evading law enforcement, which is clearly not the case.\"\n\nThe tweet caused outrage, and various outlets subsequently reported that Apple had \"banned\" the app. But on Thursday HKMap Live clarified that its app had never been available on the App Store to begin with.\n\n\"Clarification!!! We are never on the App Store, they rejected it during the review process. The process is resumed after recent appeal!\" the developer wrote.\n\nThe app is currently available on the Android Play Store.\n\nRead more: Trump congratulated China's dictators while police brutally cracked down on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong\n\nThe appmaker speculated that the rejection was the result of a \"bureaucratic f up\" rather than deliberate censorship.\n\nAddressing Apple's concerns that the app lets people avoid the police, the developer noted that the map shows people areas designated as \"illegal assembly.\" Avoiding the area would, in fact, be lawful.\n\nThe Hong Kong pro-democracy protests have continued for more than 100 days. According to the New York Times, there have been more than 1,500 arrests.\n\nViolence between protesters and police in Hong Kong has escalated considerably.
