Media speculates that Blackmoon and DSX might be the first exchanges where investors can trade the new tokens.\n\nPer an official release, the company stated that investors will need to generate a public key using a TON key generator, and provide a public key to the token issuer by October 16 to get their Grams. The company made no mention of what would happen should investors fail to meet this deadline. The TON Board also posted the TON source code on a GitHub page.\n\nTelegram also sent out a more detailed letter about the launch to investors. Russian media outlet The Bell says it has seen the full text of this letter, and has spoken to two investors in detail about the TON launch.\n\nThe media outlet said that one of the investors believes that those failing to adhere to the October 16 deadline will likely not receive their Gram tokens as quickly as others. However, the investor suggested that any investor who failed to provide the key to the TON team within two years of the launch would have their tokens burned.\n\nThe letter also confirms that neither Telegram nor TON Foundation will buy Gram from investors. Meanwhile, the public post states, \u201cNeither Telegram nor the TON Foundation will serve as validators post-launch.\u201d\n\nHowever, the letter states that it \u201cwill be possible to buy and sell the Gram on independent crypto exchanges.\u201d The Bell believes that two platforms that are likely to list the token are Blackmoon, an exchange headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and co-owned by Telegram\u2019s vice president of Business Development, and British exchange DSX.\n\nPrevious reports had claimed that the Gram would likely make its debut on Japanese exchanges.\n\nThe media outlet believes Telegram is still in talks with \u201cmultiple\u201d exchanges regarding listing options.\n\nNeither the letter nor the TON Board announcement makes mention of potential Gram prices. The Bell says that \u201cexperts\u201d believe the token will debut at the USD 2.5 - USD 3 mark, although another set of analysts claimed earlier this year, per Forbes, that the Gram could make its bow at a price as high as USD 8 per token \u2013 rising to USD 15 - USD 30 by 2028.\n\nTelegram raised a total of USD 1.7 billion in two rounds of investment for the token. First-round investors paid USD 0.37 per token, with second-round investors paying USD 1.3.\n\nIt has been reported that under the terms of the investment, Telegram is contractually obliged to provide tokens to its investors before this month is out, or face the possibility of returning the entire USD 1.7 billion to its 100+ investors.\n\nAs reported by Cryptonews.com, TON could open a new era of blockchains capable of supporting thousands of dapps (decentralized apps) on a true backend technology, according to Binance Research. Also, the researchers stressed that while Facebook's Libra vision is to reinvent how money circulates across the globe, TON attempts to improve the entire blockchain stack radically. However, the TON project still faces \"a lot of unanswered questions,\" related to scaling, centralization and ability to attract developers, they added.", "description": "Telegram has announced it will officially launch its TON blockchain network by the end of October \u2013 and has given details to investors about how to claim their Gram tokens.
