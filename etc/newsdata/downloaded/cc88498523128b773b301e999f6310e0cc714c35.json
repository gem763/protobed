He flipped his car about four miles down the highway, throwing his father, a passenger, from the vehicle. His father later died at a hospital. The now 39-year-old Halder pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in 2018 and was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation.\n\nGrewal, who was appointed in 2018 by Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, claims the course violated its license that day by serving a visibly intoxicated man alcohol and by serving liquor from a mobile cart that passes through the course \u2014 instead of solely beer as the license mandates. Businesses usually face a 25-day suspension of their liquor license for the same violation cited in the letter, but \u201cin this case, the [state] will seek revocation of the license based upon the total circumstances,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Andrew R. Sapolnick, who signed the letter, wrote without explaining further.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Trump Organization has 30 days to challenge the charges. If the revocation goes through, the course can seek to have its liquor license reinstated in two years. New Jersey law states that if a liquor license is revoked for one institution, all other institutions owned by the same company must also forfeit their licenses, the Post reported.\n\nThis suggests that Trump\u2019s other two New Jersey courses \u2014 including his course in Bedminster, where he spends the summer \u2014 would also lose their licenses.", "description": "New Jersey's attorney general is seeking to revoke the liquor license for one of President Trump\u2019s three golf courses\u00a0in the state in response to a 2015 fatal crash involving an intoxicated driver\u00a0who flipped his car after he'd just played a round of golf at the club, according to reports.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19297768159032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
