Some estimates suggest that having to treat workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, could increase costs by as much as 30%.\n\nUber and rival ridesharing service Lyft joined forces to push back again the bill. They suggested a guaranteed minimum wage of $21 per hour instead of the sweeping changes the bill would bring.\n\nBut that pledge wasn't enough to sway California's Senate, and the state's governor Gavin Newsom is expected to soon sign the bill into law. That paves the way for California's 1 million gig workers to gain added rights next year.", "description": "The law would mean the likes of Uber and Lyft would have to offer holiday and sick pay.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13AB4/production/_108746508_gettyimages-1142453872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
