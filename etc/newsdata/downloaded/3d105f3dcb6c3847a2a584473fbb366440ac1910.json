The mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.5%, though trading\n\nvolumes on both UK indexes were thin due to a U.S. market\n\nholiday.\n\nCompanies that book a major chunk of their earnings in U.S.\n\ndollars such as Diageo , Unilever and BAT\n\njumped as the pound weakened ahead of a showdown this\n\nweek between the government and the lawmakers opposed to a\n\nno-deal Brexit.\n\nWith 59 days till Britain is scheduled to leave the European\n\nUnion, Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to purge any\n\nlawmaker in his party who votes against the government on\n\nBrexit, as he looks to make good on his promise of delivering\n\nBrexit on Oct. 31, with or without a deal. The latest volley of tariffs between Washington and Beijing,\n\nwhich came into effect over the weekend, was also spurring some\n\ndefensive buying.\n\nEscalating worries over global trade and a looming recession\n\nweighed on the FTSE 100 in August, as it recorded its sharpest\n\nmonthly fall since October. Meanwhile, fears of a no-deal Brexit\n\nhad led the mid-caps to their first monthly fall since May.\n\n\"Gains may be fragile,\" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said\n\nof the FTSE 100's rise on Monday. \"After a rough August though,\n\ntraders should buckle up for more volatility in September.\"\n\nOn a low-key day for corporate news, Marks & Spencer\n\nshed 1.4% on expectations of being relegated from the FTSE 100\n\nfor the first time since the blue-chip index was created in\n\n1984. Also weighing on shares of the 135-year old retailer was\n\nGoldman Sachs reinstating coverage on the stock with a 'sell'\n\nrating, saying recent trading patterns in the retailer\n\n\"continued to be disappointing\".\n\n\"It is clear that UK consumers are becoming savvier, and M&S\n\nare undergoing a restructuring scheme, but it seems the consumer\n\nclimate is deteriorating at a quicker rate then M&S is turning\n\nitself around,\" CMC Markets analyst David Madden said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-FTSE 100 soars as election talk knocks sterling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg"}
