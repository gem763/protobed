Newzoo projects 2019 esports revenue to hit $1.1 billion, up 26.7% from 2018, driven by big brands buying sponsorships and media rights.\n\nThat\u2019s still a tiny slice of the overall video game market\u2014Newzoo pegs that at $152 billion in revenue for 2019, up 9.6% from 2018.\n\nBut as you can see from those numbers, the growth rate for esports is triple the rate of the overall video game industry.\n\n\u201cThere are 2.3 billion gamers around the world, and as an industry, video gaming is already bigger than music and movies combined,\u201d says Frank Ng, CEO of Allied Esports. \u201cWe project that esports will be the biggest format of entertainment. Every publisher in the world is getting into this.\u201d\n\nAllied Esports (AESE) is among a few small early esports IPOs\u2014it debuted on the Nasdaq in August. The company owns venues that host esports tournaments, including the HyperX Esports Arena in the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas and two HyperX Esports Trucks in North America and Europe. This week, Allied Esports partnered with Fortress Esports to open Fortress Melbourne in Australia, which will be the largest esports venue in the Southern hemisphere.\n\nAnother esports IPO this year was Super League Gaming (SLGG), which puts on amateur esports tournaments.\n\nNeither listing has done well so far; Allied Esports is down more than 20% since its debut, while Super League Gaming is down more than 50% since its debut.\n\nHyperX Esports Arena at The Luxor Las Vegas (Photo via Allied Esports) More\n\nOf course, Ng has to be bullish on his own industry. And his peers in the industry all sound the same\u2014they insist esports will only continue to balloon.\n\nBut many onlookers see a bubble, one that has already been overstated.\n\nTalk of an esports bubble\n\nEsports teams pay millions to leagues (run by major corporations like Activision Blizzard) to participate, brands pay millions to leagues to sponsor, but most teams, and most smaller esports companies, are not making a profit. Frank Fields, sponsorship manager for gaming hardware maker Corsair, told video game site Kotaku, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money going in, and not a lot of money going out.\u201d\n\nKotaku, in its extensive story in May about the possible esports bubble, reported that 17 esports industry professionals told the site they have concerns of a bubble, with some calling the industry \u201ccompletely unsustainable.\u201d Some have compared esports to the \u201890s dot-com bubble.\n\nCorsair\u2019s Fields even reportedly said on stage at a gaming conference, \u201cI feel like esports is almost running a Ponzi scheme at this point.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, big consumer brands from Coca-Cola to Red Bull to Anheuser-Busch InBev to Intel have spent big on esports sponsorships. Daniel Cherry, CMO of Activision Blizzard Esports Leagues, says sponsors are drawn in because the audience is young and global. He says 18- to 34-year-olds make up 90% of the audience for Activision Blizzard\u2019s (ATVI) esports leagues, and that segment has grown 50% year over year.\n\nFrank Ng says it\u2019s not a bubble.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a bubble if there are real participants coming into this playing it every day,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should focus on the audience. The young kids, they are watching it. Hundreds of millions of people are watching every day\u2014maybe not a formal tournament, but maybe a streamer playing competitively... This is the very early stage of a gigantic industry. We know the industry will be huge down the road. It\u2019s not a bubble.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
