But after all the heat of late, I\u2019ll take it!\n\nEXPRESS FORECAST\n\nToday: Sunny, with increasing clouds late. Highs: 63 to 69.\n\nTonight: Mostly cloudy. A shower possible. Lows: 50s.\n\nTomorrow: Mostly to partly cloudy. Shower or two? Highs: 71 to 77.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nFollowing what seemed like endless warmth, we\u2019re finally being treated to some fall conditions today. Our unacclimated bodies may even find it to be somewhat on the cool side. The good news is that the sun is still fairly strong for a few more weeks. Like usual around here, truly cool conditions don\u2019t tend to last long. We\u2019re looking at temperatures rising back to near and above average starting tomorrow. And although we could still use the rain, there\u2019s not much of that in the forecast.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device. Click here to find out how.\n\nToday (Saturday): Real fall is here. Yesterday was nice but still on the warm side. We should actually finish a bit below average with temperatures today. Skies are mainly sunny, with some increase in clouds by afternoon or evening. Highs are in the mid-60s, although the city could make it to the upper 60s or so. Winds are turning to the southeast with time, about 10 mph. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: That south wind is starting to go to work. You\u2019ll notice slightly warmer overnight lows, thanks to an increase in low-level moisture, increasing clouds and maybe a shower or two. There is likely to be no rain of consequence, and lows are mainly in the 50s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates.

It should be enough to make humidity noticeable again (dew points headed toward 60). Skies are rather cloudy, but we should see some breaks here and there. Highs are in the 70s. If we get enough sun, it could be mainly mid-70s or higher. To be determined ... Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: It stays mostly cloudy Sunday night, and there is still some risk of a shower or two, mainly north and west of the area. Lows range from about 60 to the mid-60s as humidity remains near the moderate end. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nOn Monday, the cold front enters the region and should cross the area late in the day. This often means widespread rain, but for now it seems most of that may focus to our northwest. \u201cWhen in drought, leave it out\u201d is a common phrase. We\u2019ll see here. As we\u2019re still in the warm air most or all of the day, highs range from the mid-70s to around 80. Confidence: Medium\n\nBy Tuesday, we\u2019re headed back to fall. There could be some clouds around early, but the trend will be toward mostly sunny skies. Breezes out of the northwest could be gusty at times as highs head for around or a bit past 70.
