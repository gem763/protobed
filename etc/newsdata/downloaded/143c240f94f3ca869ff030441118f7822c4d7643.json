But \u2013 as to be expected \u2013 they have a deadly sting for anyone who tries to cross them.\n\nScorpio season, which runs from October 23 \u2013 November 22, has long been associated with a period of intenseness and having the potential for darkness.\n\nAstrologer Daniela Ruby Fischer says: \u2018During Scorpio season we all get a taste of this intense energy regardless of our individual sign.\n\n\u2018The emotions that are stirred make us look more closely and question the meaning of everything. It is the season where we all dig for deeper truths and are more often than not confronted with our shadow, the part of us we usually avoid.\u2019\n\nBut just how chaotic will the next month be? And does it have to be so?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, in many ways, there\u2019s good news and bad news.\n\nScorpios often go to extreme lengths to uncover the truth. So the next month is expected to be a time of discovery and personal development across all the zodiac signs. Which seems pretty positive.\n\nDaniela says: \u2018Communication will feel like coded riddles but Scorpio being the born detective can help us decode it.\n\n\u2018Be prepared as you may uncover things that make you uncomfortable.\n\n\u2018This can however translate into jealousy and suspicion, so it\u2019s important to be wary.\u2019\n\nShe adds: \u2018Stay away from your partner\u2019s phone and social media accounts, focus on yourself.\n\n\u2018A little jealousy may be healthy and normal when acknowledged but paranoia can ruin a relationship. Trust your gut but don\u2019t sabotage yourself.\u2019\n\nBut if that wasn\u2019t enough for one month, Mercury is in retrograde during Scorpio season, which is set to make this period even more intense. Mercury in retrograde is known for bringing disruption and causing breakdowns of communication.\n\nAstrologer Francesca Oddie says, \u2018Mercury in retrograde often indicates confusion delays frustrations and miscommunication, however it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean chaos.\n\n\u2018Mercury rules transport, communication, our thoughts and the way we express ourselves.\n\n\u2018When Mercury goes into retrograde, all areas of life governed by Mercury are not straightforward. However, this also offers an opportunity to do all things beginning with the letters \u201cre\u201d, so review, rest, reconsider, re-evaluate, resign and redo anything that needs an upgrade.\u2019\n\nFittingly, the mayhem is due to start on 31 October \u2013 aka Halloween.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone, no matter what star sign, should expect powerful shifts across all areas \u2013 from relationships and personal values to growth and finances.\n\nFrancesca adds: \u2018Mercury retrograde in Scorpio asks us to confront our deepest and most private emotional self and it is an opportunity to explore the way we feel and respond.\n\n\u2018Chaos ensues when we turn a blind eye to what we feel and focus only on what we think.\n\n\u2018At the time of mercury retrograde, intuitive brain drives. Mercury will always present us with some level of entertainment.\n\n\u2018It is our response to traffic jams, computers wiping themselves clean, miscommunication by email and petty arguments that sets the tone.\n\n\u2018Mercury retrograde is only chaotic if we are not prepared. Before the 31st, back up your computer and leave yourself enough time between appointments made.\u2019\n\nBut this is the last time Mercury is in retrograde this year.
