In other cases, they were hardcore killers.\n\n\"Terrorists who oppress and murder innocent people should never sleep soundly, knowing that we will completely destroy them,\" he said.\n\n\"These savage monsters will not escape their fate, and they will not escape the final judgment of God.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, Mr Trump' s re-election campaign leapt into action, soliciting funds for 2020 by hitting supporters' in-boxes with an email trumpeting the \"fierce leadership\" which led to al-Baghdadi's death.\n\nWilliam Barr's review into the origins of the Russian probe has become a criminal investigation. AP\n\nClearly, al-Baghdadi won't pack the same punch that Osama Bin Laden's death did for Barack Obama in May 2011, but it does tip the political scales back into the President's favour.\n\nFor weeks now commentators and political advisers have been hammering home one of the key lessons of Bill Clinton's impeachment two decades ago.\n\nNo matter how bad the process became, Mr Clinton's White House maintained a strict focus on continuing the of job of being president. It sent the message to the American public that the Republicans were pursing a folly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has so far failed to adopt the benefits of that strategy. His approach has been reactive. He tweets, or storms, at every turn in the process up on Capitol Hill. He has often seemed erratic and emotional.\n\nAnd his attempts at distraction have made it difficult for his own supporters to back him. Last week's decision to reverse a decision to hold a Group of Seven summit at his Florida resort next year is a case in point. Republicans on the Hill implored Trump to drop the idea, which they found impossible to defend.\n\nThe ISIS raid, therefore, has come at a crucial moment for Mr Trump, who is almost certain to be impeached by the House of Representatives before an eventual acquittal in the Senate.\n\nAt that point, Mr Trump may have another ace up his sleeve, and one that is being under reported.\n\nAll eyes have been on impeachment, but there's arguably a counter-process that is only now starting to emerge as a serious consideration: the review into the origins of the FBI's counter-intelligence case against Mr Trump's campaign in 2016.\n\nThe review, announced by Mr Trump in late-May, takes in the circumstances around Alexander Downer's bar-room chat with a Trump campaign official which led to the bureau's investigation.\n\nThat investigation ultimately led to the Mueller probe, which Mr Trump has always regarded as a politically-motivated witch hunt.\n\nLate last week, news organisations in the US reported that Attorney-General William Barr's probe had now turned into a criminal investigation, which means a federal prosecutor can now subpoena witnesses and use a grand jury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's a big step up from a straight review, as the process was originally characterised in May.\n\nAustralia may be out of the woods, in the sense that Mr Trump's people don't believe the country did anything wrong in relaying to US security agencies Downer's account of the bar-room conversation in which the campaign official mentioned Russians having \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton.\n\nInstead the focus is on whether the FBI acted with a \"hair trigger\", opening a hugely significant case on Downer's hearsay.\n\nThere's a long way to go on this process, but the early signs are already there: Barr's investigation, especially if it leads to criminal charges, will enable Mr Trump to reinforce his message that the \"deep state\" has been after him since day one.\n\nAnd his pitch to voters, according to one Washington seasoned observer, will be simple: \"if they're coming after me, they're coming after you\".\n\nIn the meantime, Trump's campaign continues to raise staggering sums of money for the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, are frittering away resources across a vast field of candidates mired in internecine warfare.", "description": "The ISIS raid has come at a crucial moment for President Trump, who is almost certain to be impeached by the House of Representatives before an eventual acquittal in the Senate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3531%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/635fbfed03325f3d40c4c0147b87803f5191088e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
