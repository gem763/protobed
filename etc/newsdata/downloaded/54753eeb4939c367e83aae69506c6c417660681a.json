U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s conflicts with China have cooled somewhat this month but remain unresolved and other disputes are simmering with Europe.\n\n\u201cThere are significant risks,\u201d Georgieva said. \u201cGrowth could be derailed if trade disputes lead to further cross-border restrictions, including on technology, or incite broader monetary, exchange rate, or financial sector policy actions.\u201d", "description": "IMF Chief Calls for Reversing Tariffs Threatening Global Growth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf337420e41d5edf681423a60ef230b9e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
