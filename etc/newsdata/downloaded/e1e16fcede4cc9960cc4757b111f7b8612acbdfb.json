The Carolina Panthers have a much more uncertain situation under center.\n\nWhether Cam Newton is healthy enough to play or the Panthers turn to backup Kyle Allen - who was Murray\u2019s college teammate - the matchup will have plenty of intrigue.\n\nMurray, the No. 1 overall pick in April, has had a very promising start to his NFL career. He\u2019s just the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 300 yards in his first two career games.\n\nThe other guy? Newton, who was also the No. 1 pick in 2011. Both also won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nMurray said he\u2019s never met Newton, but has admired him since he was a teenager.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always watched him. I love watching him,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHe was one of my favorite quarterbacks growing up, so I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe question is if Newton will play. The nine-year veteran hasn\u2019t practiced this week because of a mid-foot sprain.\n\nIf Newton can\u2019t go, the Panthers (0-2) will turn to Allen, who is in his second season and has just one career start. Murray and Allen played together at Texas A&M; in 2015, splitting time for a team that finished with an 8-5 record.\n\nIn a strange twist, both of them ended up transferring at the end of the season. The two say they got along fine, even if circumstances weren\u2019t ideal. Murray called it a \u201ctough situation.\u201d Allen said they were \u201cnever super tight. We had a mutual respect for each other obviously.\u201d\n\nNow they might be on the same NFL field.\n\n\u201cWe went to school together. We played together,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have control over who starts over there. That\u2019s their deal. I just have to get ready to play, and whoever\u2019s their quarterback is their quarterback.\u201d\n\nFOUNTAIN OF YOUTH\n\nReceiver Larry Fitzgerald has looked 10 years younger over the Cardinals\u2019 first two games with 13 catches for 217 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThe 36-year-old has developed a quick rapport with Murray and the connection looks like it\u2019s going to go-to for Arizona (0-1-1) all season. Panthers coach Ron Rivera said Fitzgerald is a player - along with Panthers TE Greg Olsen - who he encourages young players to emulate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the right kind of person, the right kind of young man who understands what it takes to be successful in this game,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cIt honestly doesn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019s still playing, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019s having success like he is because he works at it.\n\nRED-ZONE WOES\n\nArizona\u2019s offense has been very efficient this year except when it gets in the red zone. That was a big issue in last week\u2019s 23-17 loss to Baltimore: The Cardinals had to settle for three field goals after getting inside Baltimore\u2019s 5-yard line. It would help to get David Johnson going in the run game. He had just 14 yards rushing on seven carries in Week 2.\n\nKUECHLY ON A TEAR\n\nThe Panthers may be 0-2 but it has little to do with the play of linebacker Luke Kuechly, who is off to another terrific start. The five-time All-Pro selection had 17 tackles, including a tackle in the end zone on running back Peyton Barber for a safety in last week\u2019s 20-14 loss to the Buccaneers. Kuechly now has 973 tackles for his career, passing Hall of Fame linebacker Brian Urlacher for the most tackles by a player through his first eight seasons. Kuechly\u2019s average of 9.4 tackles per game is second only to Miami\u2019s Zach Thomas (9.8) in NFL history.\n\n\u201cThey have such smart defensive players,\u201d said Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury. \u201cIt starts with Kuechly, who gets everything lined up and has such a great feel for the game and knows what offenses are going to run before they even run it.\u201d\n\nALL McCAFFREY, ALL THE TIME\n\nPanthers offensive coordinator Norv Turner said before the season he wanted to limit Christian McCaffrey\u2019s reps in the offense for fear of wearing him down. Well, that hasn\u2019t quite happened. Through two games, McCaffrey has been on the field for all 137 offensive plays. After combining for 209 yards on offense and two TDs in the season opener against the Rams, McCaffrey will look to get back on track against Arizona after being held to 53 yards by the Bucs. The Panthers scored 14 points against Tampa Bay, but it came on four field goals and safety.\n\nTHIRD-DOWN STRUGGLES\n\nIf the Panthers want to succeed on offense it will need to start with moving the chains and sustaining drives. Carolina is converting a paltry 32 percent of its third downs (8 of 25) and is 0 for 3 on fourth-down conversions. A big part of that is the Panthers haven\u2019t utilized multidimensional Newton as a runner as they have in the past due to shoulder and foot issues. In fact, Newton has five carries for minus-2 yards with two fumbles. With Allen expected to start at QB, it could add another dimension to the offense.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Steve Reed contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyler Murray's going to be the quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.
