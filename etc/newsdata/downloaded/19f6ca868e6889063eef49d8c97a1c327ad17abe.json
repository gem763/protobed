The club said it has a debt of 1.4 million kronor to the Swedish Tax Agency \u201cwhich must be resolved quickly.\u201d\n\nUnder Potter, Ostersund rose from the amateur ranks in 2011 to Sweden\u2019s top league in 2015, and won the Swedish Cup in 2017. That qualified Ostersund for the Europa League, where it advanced to the knockout stage before losing to Arsenal despite winning the second leg 2-1 at Emirates Stadium.\n\nPotter moved to Swansea in the English second tier last season and joined Brighton this offseason.\n\nThe man who hired Potter and is regarded as the mastermind behind Osterdund\u2019s rise, former chairman Daniel Kindberg, was recently in court in Sweden accused of serious financial crimes. Kindberg is said to have helped funnel millions of kronor in taxpayer money into the club in a scheme that involved two other men and three companies, one being the Ostersund municipality\u2019s housing corporation for which Kindberg was chief executive.\n\nKindberg denies the accusations. The verdict is set to be announced on Nov. 5, and Ostersund could lose its place in the Swedish top flight if Kindberg is found guilty.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Swedish soccer team Ostersund says former manager Graham Potter has made a \"big contribution\" of cash to help keep the club in business amid severe financial problems.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
