The trust is tasked with picking the Broncos\u2019 next controlling owner.\n\nThe daughters alleged that their father lacked the mental capacity when he signed his estate planning documents in 2009.\n\nThe challenge puts the women at risk of being disinherited by the trust because of a no-contest clause in Bowlen\u2019s will, according to the report.\n\nBowlen, who died in June at age 75, had suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Another lawsuit related to the ongoing dispute stated that Bowlen began showing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s as early as 2006, The Denver Post reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDan Reilly, a lawyer who represents the trust, told the AP that the lawsuit was \u201cthe latest effort in their public campaign to circumvent Pat Bowlen\u2019s wishes.\u201d\n\nBowlen turned over control of the team to three trustees in 2014, according to a New York Times report. The trustees set criteria that Bowlen\u2019s seven children would need to meet in order to become the team\u2019s controlling owner, and they have disagreed with Wallace\u2019s claim that she has qualified.\n\nWallace has previously held a position with the Broncos, and two of Bowlen\u2019s brothers have supported her bid for control, the Times reported.\n\nBut she isn\u2019t alone in seeking to be the team\u2019s next controlling owner. Her younger sister Brittany Bowlen, a daughter Pat Bowlen had with his second wife, also has ambition to take over, according to the report.\n\nNFL arbitration proceedings are due to begin in November, the Post reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Two daughters of deceased Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen have filed a lawsuit in an effort to gain control of the team valued at $2.5 billion.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/mark-sanchez-broncos-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
