USA TODAY\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 It was not a perfect 10, but LSU won for the 10th consecutive time against Auburn in Tiger Stadium, a 23-20 victory in front of 102,160 Saturday night.\n\nThe Tigers, who are ranked No. 3 in the Amway Coaches Poll, can now make a strong argument for a No. 1 ranking as it improved to 8-0 overall and 4-0 in the Southeastern Conference with its third defeat of a team ranked in the top 10 at the time of the game.\n\nThe Tigers previously won at No. 10 Texas, 45-38, on Sept. 7 and beat No. 7 Florida, 42-28, on Oct. 12.\n\nAlabama (7-0, 4-0 SEC) is No. 1, but has played only one ranked team this season, beating No. 21 Texas A&M, 47-28, on Oct. 12. Clemson (7-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) is No. 2, but it has no wins over ranked teams.\n\nLSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire celebrates a touchdown run during the third quarter against Auburn.

That's out of our hands,\" LSU coach Ed Orgeron said of the rankings. \"We'll control what we can control and let it happen.\"\n\nLSU has an open week before a possible No. 1 vs. No. 2 \"Game of the Century\" on Nov. 9 at Alabama, which played Saturday night at home against Arkansas (2-5, 0-4 SEC) and is open next week as well.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 9 in college football\n\nTOO GOOD: Big-time players have Ohio State looking like the No. 1 team\n\nSILVER LINING: The one good thing from Oklahoma's stunning loss\n\nThe first College Football Playoff poll comes out the week after the LSU-Alabama game.\n\nThe Tigers dominated Auburn statistically with 508 yards to 287 as quarterback Joe Burrow completed 32 of 42 passes for 321 yards and tailback Clyde Edwards-Helaire gained 136 yards on 26 carries, but struggled to put the game away.\n\nThrough three quarters. LSU outgained Auburn by 431 yards to 222, but led by only 16-13. Finally, LSU put some distance between themselves and the other Tigers when Burrow sprinted seven yards for a touchdown and 23-13 lead on a quarterback draw up the middle with 13:29 to play.\n\nBurrow also converted a third and eight with a 10-yard scramble that was not planned early in the drive that covered 67 yards in 11 plays and made up for previous frustration in the red zone.\n\nAuburn cut it to 23-20 on a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Pat Nix to Seth Williams with 2:32 to play, but failed to recover its subsequent onside kick.\n\nLSU came in averaging 50.1 points per game and had not previously scored fewer than 36 points in a game, but Auburn\u2019s defensive front put pressure on Burrow, sacking him three times.\n\nBurrow also threw an interception near the goal line that denied a scoring opportunity.\n\n\"This wasn't the prettiest game,\" Orgeron said. \"We had too many penalties (12 for 118 yards) and too many turnovers (one fumble, one interception). The passing game was tough sledding because of the pressure.\"\n\nThere will be an off week to take care of some of the issues before that meeting with Alabama that should truly determine if the Tigers are the top team in the country.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "description": "No. 3 LSU won its third game against a team ranked in the top 10 opponent by defeating Auburn and making a case for the No. 1 ranking.", "authors": ["Glenn Guilbeau", "Published P.M.
