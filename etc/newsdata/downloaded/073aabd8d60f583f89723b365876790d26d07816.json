But now the trend has expanded to other major metro areas, according to the new report. Communities along Silicon Valley, like Santa Clara, California, have moved to add space for passive recreation along with new developments. Outside Chicago, communities like Evanston, Illinois offer rooftop bars, shopping and access to Chicago via public transit. Near Atlanta, the report found that suburban communities were using walkable, mixed-use developments in a bid to attract a pool of young workers.\n\nThe trend has even been growing in smaller markets like Charleston and college towns like Tempe, Arizona, according to the report.\n\nPeople are discovering that those smaller communities can have all the same charms as a big city, the report found. It predicts that some millennials will continue moving to those suburban communities that present \u201chip\u201d offerings.\n\nRothman said many people move up to Westchester looking for a home in walking distance to a train. But once they get there, it ends up not being so important.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing less and less of people who are moving to our area because of the short commute to the city,\u201d Rothman said. \u201cA lot of people are moving here and not really looking to commute, or they\u2019re going in one day a week. And they\u2019re finding this area as an area where their businesses can thrive as well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just millennials who are fueling growth in \u201chipsturbia,\u201d according to Rothman. She said empty-nesters looking to downsize are also opting to stay in their towns instead of moving into the city.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people wanting to stay, because the communities are awesome and they have everything they need right here,\u201d Rothman said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Suburban living is drawing millennials outside of metro areas.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/scardale.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
