You will need to carry a face mask today as yellow dust has blown in from overseas on the back of westerly winds. Central western regions are coated with the polluted air. The season's first fine dust advisory has also been issued in Seoul, Incheon, Jeollabuk-do and Chungcheongnam-do Province, but it's forecast to cover more regions as southeasterly winds will spread around the country. An autumn chill is in store for tomorrow morning with a low of 5 degrees Celsius, but readings will return to seasonal norms by the afternoon. A chilly wind is forecast to wash away the dust tomorrow. Daily highs will be slightly higher than yesterday under mostly sunny skies but avoid outdoor activities and wash your hands frequently. Fairly sunny skies will dominate most parts of the country for the next few days, be aware of temperature fluctuations and dress accordingly. That's Korea for you and here's the international weather for viewers around the world. 2019-10-29 08:14:40 KST", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1, The World On Arirang, Arirang TV is a public service agency that spreads the uniqueness of Korea to the world through cutting-edge broadcasting mediums.", "authors": ["The Korea International Broadcasting Foundation"], "top_image": "http://img.arirang.com/images/news/hope/banner_psr1.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
