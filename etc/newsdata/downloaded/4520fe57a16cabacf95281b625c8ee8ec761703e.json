We want to lay a platform for generations to come after us. They must know that as a human being, you can do anything you put your mind to. Students must not limit themselves based on specific disciplines that they are doing.\"", "description": "Four Rhodes University PhD Chemistry students have come out tops in the 2019 Hult Prize Challenge for their electronic and electrical waste management system, putting them in line to win a R14.3m startup injection for their business idea.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8811/99e177b3b3774616955ed606285d9129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-01"}
