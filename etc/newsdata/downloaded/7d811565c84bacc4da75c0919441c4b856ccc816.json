The president is asserting autocratic authority to ignore the people\u2019s elected representatives and the Constitution that governs them. This is a new stage in an already dangerous presidency.\n\nThe letter, astonishingly signed by an individual with a law degree, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, declares that the president will cooperate in no way with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. It follows a White House order that a key executive branch witness may not testify before Congress. \u201cYou seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen,\u201d Mr. Cipollone fumes. \u201cThe President cannot allow your constitutionally illegitimate proceedings to distract him and those in the Executive Branch.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo bolster his case, Mr. Cipollone invents restrictions on how the House may conduct impeachment inquiries, even though the Constitution vests the House with \u201cthe sole power of impeachment\u201d and specifies that the House \u201cmay determine the rules of its proceedings.\u201d Mr. Cipollone also argues that the case against Mr. Trump is so weak, the president\u2019s behavior so \u201ccompletely appropriate,\u201d that the House\u2019s motive must be illegitimate. It is House Democrats, he insists, who must be investigated.\n\n\u201cBananas\u201d; \u201ca barely-lawyered temper tantrum\u201d; \u201cpure hackery\u201d: These are just some of the words that Republican lawyers have used to describe Mr. Cipollone\u2019s screed.\n\nDemocrats should conduct their inquiries with the good faith that many Republicans have not shown. That includes maximum transparency, so legislators can persuade the public to consider a body of evidence, collected fairly, against Mr. Trump. But the right of the House to conduct its investigation and, if it so chooses, to impeach Mr. Trump is beyond doubt. So is the responsibility of the executive branch to comply with legal congressional subpoenas.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president does not get to decide which congressional actions are legitimate and, therefore, which congressional commands he accepts. If he has a specific claim that his circumscribed right to executive privilege should prevent the turnover of a particular document or the testimony of a particular witness, he should make a case-by-case argument. Instead, he has essentially claimed that he can ignore Congress if he so chooses. And, in true Trumpian fashion, he insists that his lawlessness is constitutionally approved while those legitimately endowed with the power to hold him to account are betraying the nation\u2019s founding document.\n\nIn fact, the Constitution unambiguously empowers the House to conduct an impeachment, and it grants the president no authority to impede it. If members of Congress \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 do not flatly reject Mr. Trump\u2019s letter, they will humiliate themselves and shred the constitutional order. They cannot allow the president to say that the law is not the law.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "The president does not get to decide which congressional actions are legitimate.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9vCVvxSh66MPenkvU8EsshkiRig=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XPR76MXK34I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
