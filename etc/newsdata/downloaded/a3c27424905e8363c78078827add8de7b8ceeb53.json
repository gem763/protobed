On one hand, it\u2019s seen as a time of freedom and self-discovery, but it\u2019s also a period when you\u2019re most likely to succumb to social pressures and conform to certain trends.\n\nSociety has a fascination with youth and see being young as being happy, but being young in today\u2019s world comes with its own issues.\n\nWe are one of the first generations to be worse off financially than our parents.\n\nAusterity cuts over the past decade have seen youth services stripped bare leaving us out on the streets, 91 per cent of schools have had their per pupil funding cut, and 75 per cent of young people experiencing mental health problems aren\u2019t receiving the treatment they need.\n\nWe are one of the first generations to be worse off financially than our parents (Picture: Jerry Syder/Metro.co.uk)\n\nYoung people, especially ones who already face additional barriers due to other forms of social prejudice will not have the same opportunity to grow as the previous generations had.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI enjoy being politically active and voicing my opinions on a variety of issues. I\u2019m engaged with girls\u2019 rights and am part of the Youth Advisory Panel for the global children\u2019s charity Plan International UK.\n\nAt school, I had some amazing teachers who encouraged me and my peers to discuss complex issues and sought to engage us in our political future.\n\nDespite all of this, I\u2019ve regularly been dismissed by adults as some kind of \u2018snowflake\u2019 and accused of being oversensitive because I\u2019m standing up for what I believe in.\n\nIn 2016, during the EU referendum, I was vocal about the fact that 16 and 17 year olds should get the vote, something I still feel very passionate about.\n\nBeing a teenager can be a turbulent time and being a teenage girl can be even more complex (Picture: Jerry Syder/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBut I was met with a lot of opposition, especially on social media, from adults who felt a 16-year-old didn\u2019t have enough life experience or political knowledge to be part of these discussions. It was frustrating so many people felt that way.\n\nI\u2019m encouraged to see a surge of teenage politicisation and the impact of work carried about by various teenage activists such as Greta Thunberg (who helped set up the Schools Strike 4 Climate Marches that took place all over the globe) and the students behind Our Future, Our Choice as a way of campaigning for a People\u2019s Vote.\n\nAs young people we\u2019re battling to create a safe and sustainable future for us but we\u2019re being met with hostility and people patronising us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know personally that the experiences I have had with those deemed more experienced than me have been tainted by their prejudices towards my age, gender and working-class background.\n\nBeing a teenager can be a turbulent time and being a teenage girl can be even more complex.\n\nI enjoy being politically active and voicing my opinions on a variety of issues (Picture: Jerry Syder/Metro.co.uk)\n\nOver a short period of six years we are expected to cope with the fact that our bodies and minds will change in ways that we\u2019ve never experienced, while continuing to lead our \u2018best life\u2019 on social media.\n\nWe face stigma about having a period and face unwanted attention and comments in public. For me it was being catcalled while walking to school wearing my school uniform (Plan International UK found that 35 per cent of girls had also experienced harassment while in their school uniform).\n\nWe also sit countless exams and deal with copious amounts of stress as we\u2019re told these are the be all and end all of your academic success (spoiler alert: they\u2019re not).\n\nWith all these changes and challenges, we need comprehensive education to help us navigate life as a teen, but in most schools, including mine, that was missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m approaching my 20th birthday and while I\u2019m ready to face the next decade as a \u2018twentysomething\u2019, a part of me will miss being a teen and how much I\u2019ve grown over the past six years.\n\nI\u2019d like to think it\u2019s provided me with a foundation on which to build my future.\n\nLooking ahead to adulthood, certain milestones such as buying a house worry me, however I\u2019m excited to continue to assert my independence and start working towards my professional future.\n\nYou can find out more about Plan International UK here.\n\nLabels Labels is an exclusive series that hears from individuals who have been labelled \u2013 whether that be by society, a job title, or a diagnosis. Throughout the project, writers will share how having these words ascribed to them shaped their identity \u2014 positively or negatively \u2014 and what the label means to them.
