He looked and sounded different.\n\nRuiz is the Mexican Rocky, the late-replacement kid with the giant cross dangling on his belly and the most unlikely of wins, the boxing upset of the year. However, this is boxing, it\u2019s heavyweight boxing and shocks happen. Joshua looks like the hungry and angry fighter this time, the man determined to put right a wrong.\n\n\u201cI could talk up here in a different way,\u201d said Joshua at Friday\u2019s conference. \u201cCircumstances should not change character - my challenges are there for all to see. There is motivation for this fight and I believe Ruiz is the best heavyweight in the world. But, motivation for me is not just about the boxing.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nJoshua has been back in the gym behind closed doors, working on what went wrong and going over tactics. Perhaps the rematch will be about brains, the brains missing in New York. At the conference, Joshua had a real edge back, a welcome return in all ways. Ruiz, meanwhile, was all about family and love and buying things he desired. Joshua just kept glancing over. He has done that stuff before; there seems to be a bigger prize in this fight for Joshua than the gold and the belts the winner will enjoy. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough camp,\u201d he admitted.\n\nThe pair were polite enough this week as they travelled in and out of airports and hotels. Ruiz endlessly smiling and Joshua just gently getting slightly more agitated as the hours ticked and air miles accrued. \u201cHe might be getting up earlier, running at 6:30am - this will be a hard camp,\u201d confirmed Robert McCracken, who has been with Joshua in the corner for nine years. The loss is the motivation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz in pictures Show all 38 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI believe most fighters become better when they first taste defeat,\u201d warned Manny Robles, the man in Ruiz\u2019s corner. \u201cJoshua has less pressure now - that makes him dangerous. I know that because that is what happened to Andy after he lost. Andy has just kept that desire going.\u201d\n\nRuiz has enjoyed every second of his reign since the fight finished in the second minute of round seven with Joshua and the referee locked in a bizarre dance of question and refusal. Ruiz has bought houses, fancy cars, extra bling, continued to eat and lined his wardrobe with new cowboy boots and many splendid sombreros. He sat back, acted cool and watched as his guaranteed rematch figure increased. Ruiz was always going to overcome his fears of travelling to the boxing frontier if he had an enhanced stash. The Yemen dilemma was not part of Ruiz\u2019s initial reluctance, trust me.\n\nIt was over 100 nights ago that the bell sounded for their fight; Joshua was smart for two rounds, dropped Ruiz in the third and then got clobbered and never fully recovered. Four times he was down in the horror show and has never offered excuses. He called the punch that set in motion the loss \u201clucky\u201d, and that might be about right without being harsh on Ruiz. Ruiz was hurt and he responded wildly. At the end Joshua was odd, concussed, dazed, confused and honest: \u201cI got involved. What a fucking fight.\u201d He is right, by the way.\n\nAn uneasy cartel of instant critics were quick to dismiss Joshua the moment the referee waved off the fight. There was far too much glee on 1 June in that old Garden ring as Ruiz howled and Joshua, in reflective isolation in a corner, looked on. In 1971 at the end of the Fight of the Century, in the same ring, Muhammad Ali held his swollen head high in defeat and Joe Frazier in glory needed his friends to dress him. \u201cWe dressed him like a drunk,\u201d Yank Durham, his manger said. Most of the press rejoiced, desperate to keep Ali on the outside. The late and great Hugh McIllvanney assessed the celebrations in the press rows and shook his head: \u201cThe big man came out bigger than he went in.\u201d Perhaps the same is true of Joshua now that the hype, invincibility and stupid claims have gone forever.\n\nOn 7 December in a far and distant land, under an ancient sky that will feel like it hits the ground a mile out in the desert, they will fight again with their bellies, their demons and their ambitions. They will both be very different men when the bell sounds.", "description": "A new Anthony Joshua stood in front of Andy Ruiz Jr on Friday afternoon in London at the end of three days, three conferences in three cities and too many questions.
