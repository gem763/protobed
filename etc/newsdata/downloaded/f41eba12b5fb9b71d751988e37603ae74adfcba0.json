The league runs a training center in Xinjiang, a region where the state has imprisoned and subjugated an entire class of people who are part of the Uighur minority. The NBA\u2019s most progressive coaches, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, have rightfully spoken out against the Trump administration\u2019s Muslim ban. If anyone associated with the league were to bring attention to human rights abuses it\u2019s them, but neither man publicly addressed the Chinese government\u2019s imprisonment of roughly a million Uighurs while they were in the country with USA Basketball for this summer\u2019s FIBA Championships.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver addressed possible tensions at the outset of a \u201ctrade war\u201d between the U.S. and China in June. \u201cI am not concerned at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re not immune from global politics. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to. I look, though, to sports\u2014and this is something Yao and I have discussed\u2014where we can use basketball maybe in the way pingpong was used in the days of Richard Nixon. There could be something called \u2018basketball diplomacy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe NBA hosts two exhibition games in China this week and Silver will be in attendance. The league has already made it clear that it won\u2019t stand by its stated values in the face of real financial pressure. \u201cBasketball diplomacy\u201d was easier when was it just about tariffs.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nick Greene", "Slate.Com Culture Daryl-Morey-Hong-Kong-China-Nba-Houston-Rockets.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
