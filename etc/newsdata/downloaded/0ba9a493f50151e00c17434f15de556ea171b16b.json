A dying and toxic patriarch brings the family together around his deathbed, where they must sift through the wreckage and dark family secrets.\n\nThe buzz: A \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 review (out of four) for USA TODAY says Attenberg \u201cdoesn\u2019t flinch from digging into life\u2019s messiness, pressing gently but resolutely into wounds to see what oozes out.\u201d\n\n2. \"Agent Running in the Field,\" by John le Carr\u00e9 (Viking, fiction, on sale Oct. 22)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: The master of espionage novels (\u201cThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold,\u201d \u201cTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\u201d) returns with an aging veteran of MI6 being called back to London in a spy thriller that grapples with modern political issues.\n\nThe buzz: In a \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd review for USA TODAY, book critic Don Oldenburg says, \u201cle Carr\u00e9\u2019s storytelling genius frequently causes pause to consider what a pleasure it is to read him.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cOne Day: The Extraordinary Story of an Ordinary 24 Hours in America,\u201d by Gene Weingarten (Blue Rider Press, nonfiction, on sale Oct. 22)\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: This book has a fascinating conceit: Pulitzer Prize-winner Weingarten asked three strangers to pick a day, month and year from a hat.
