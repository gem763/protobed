He wanted to stay and hopefully be ready for the second game.\n\n(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBut the England medical staff - he had the flu \u2013 didn't want it to spread to his team-mates and decided it was best for him to leave the camp.\n\n\u201cHe leaves, he gets some tablets off our guys at the club and he feels better.\n\n\u201cHe watches the England game at home alone on the Friday and then goes out at half-time to a casino on his own.\n\n\u201cHe will probably make better decisions in his life but he went to sit and watch the second half by a poker table.\n\n(Image: Plumb Images)\n\n\u201cThe suggestions he left England purposely being ill and then goes to a casino are totally not the case at all.\n\n\u201cBut his eyes have been opened to the wider world now. He knows in hindsight he made a mistake.\n\n\u201cBut if you know him, you know he is not going to sit in the casino all night spending thousands of pounds of money.\n\n\u201cIt is not what this boy is about.\n\n\u201cHe is a very talented boy and has a belief in his ability.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe is a wonderful personality on the field and is actually a really good boy off it. He wants to learn and is desperate to play for England, that is his ambition and life.\n\n\u201cThis is a boy who has played at the lower levels and has gone up to Scotland to further his education.\n\n\u201cHe has played in the Championship and now finds himself in the Premier League. He is a big talent and he has shown that.\n\n\u201cHe doesn't feel entitled to play for England but he really wants to. He talks about football and he practises everyday.\n\n\u201cHis dream is to one day represent England. I am sure at some point in his career he will do that.\n\n\u201cBut until that day he is going to fight and going to work.\n\n\"He will learn from his mistake. I've spoken to him and said to him: 'this is a safe environment for you'. Sometimes I will tell him things below the belt.\n\n\u201cBut he knows the environment is here for him at Leicester to improve and develop.\n\n\u201cHe won't always be told what he wants to hear but he understands he has maybe made a slight mistake in terms of where he went to.\u201d", "description": "The Foxes boss has jumped to the defence of the Leicester City midfielder", "authors": ["James Nursey", "Image", "Getty Images", "Camerasport Via Getty Images", "Plumb Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20643717.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-FC-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
