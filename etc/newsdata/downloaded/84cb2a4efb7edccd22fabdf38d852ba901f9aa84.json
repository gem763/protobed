Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, adding that the evidence concerns two witnesses in particular, whom he declined to name.\n\nAnd Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) said, \u201cThere\u2019s some testimony already that has suggested there has been conversation\u201d among witnesses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to protect the integrity of the investigation and prevent witnesses from sharing their testimony with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can only do that so much.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have argued that, at this early stage in the impeachment inquiry, proceedings need to happen behind closed doors so that witnesses aren\u2019t aware of exactly what other witnesses are saying and, therefore, aren\u2019t able to adjust their stories so that they\u2019re all on the same page.\n\nThat witnesses might coordinate, Swalwell said, is concerning \u201cbecause they would tailor [testimony] to try and help each other or manufacture alibis.\u201d\n\nDoing so while lying under oath, of course, is a crime\u2014something that several Democrats believe may have been committed by at least one witness, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Short of that, less-than-candid testimony from witnesses threatens to undermine the investigation that Democrats are attempting to conduct, all while they get attacked relentlessly by Republicans for not holding hearings that are open to the public.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump\u2019s defenders in the GOP escalated their opposition by storming the secure room in the U.S. Capitol where depositions have been taking place, grinding the impeachment inquiry to a halt\u2014if only for a day\u2014as they demanded Democrats open up the proceedings to the country.\n\nOf the witnesses Democrats have heard from in closed-door sessions so far, most have been career State Department or Pentagon officials, who have raised alarms over how Trump and his allies pressured Ukraine to open up investigations into the president\u2019s political rivals while holding $400 million in security aid over their heads. Two of those witnesses, Sondland and former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, are connected to Trump personally and are linked to carrying out the president\u2019s Ukraine plans. If Democrats have their way, they will soon be hearing testimony from other witnesses in that category.\n\n\u201cAnything that\u2019s not patently illegal, they\u2019re going to try to get away with,\u201d said one lawmaker with knowledge of the proceedings of some of the Trumpworld witnesses.\n\nBut several lawmakers involved in the impeachment inquiry acknowledged it would be inevitable that at least some of the witnesses\u2014many of whom have personal relationships with each other after working in similar places in government\u2014might speak to each other as the inquiry unfolds.\n\n\u201cCertainly, that\u2019s the thing we want to avoid,\u201d said Rep. Harley Rouda (D-CA), who said he could not \u201copine\u201d on whether it was clear that certain witnesses had coordinated with each other in the midst of the impeachment inquiry. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that these witnesses haven\u2019t talked to each other over the last few months, because they're all operating in the same theater of Ukraine\u2014many of them, obviously.\u201d\n\nBut several other Democrats who are participating in the inquiry are not under the impression there is any widespread effort afoot by certain witnesses to deny candid testimony to the impeachment committees.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-CT), also an Intelligence panel member, said he personally did not believe that witnesses had been coordinating with each other. \u201cI take that very much with a grain of salt,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has come in other than Sondland, maybe Volker, that could somehow be regarded as complicit here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it could be\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d added Himes. \u201cBut [Swalwell] could be seeing something I\u2019m not seeing.\u201d", "description": "The evidence concerns two unnamed witnesses in particular, said Rep.
