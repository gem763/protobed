This was deliberate and intentional.\n\n\n\nHe broke FBI protocol, knowing what he was doing. And it seems he did so for the purpose of targeting Trump. \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) August 29, 2019\n\nRemember the 1/6/17 dossier briefing Comey, Brennan, and Clapper gave Trump? Comey has said it was a defensive briefing, simply to give Trump a heads up.\n\n\n\nThe IG report contradicts this.\n\n\n\nIt says the FBI wanted to use the meeting to get \"information of value\" for Russia probe. \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) August 29, 2019", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:10:02AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/176/08998385-8bfd-4f5c-9693-3961ace6f083.jpg"}
