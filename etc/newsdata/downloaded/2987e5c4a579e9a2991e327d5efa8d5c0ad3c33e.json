Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\n\u201cEven accounting for a seasonal lull, mortgage lending in June was down across nearly all buyer-types including first-time buyers, home-movers and buy-to-let landlords, year-on-year for June,\u201d says Daniel Hegarty, CEO and founder of online mortgage broker and lender Habito.\n\n\u201cFlat property prices don\u2019t seem enough to tempt people to look in estate agents\u2019 windows. Stamp duty is a hefty charge on top of the purchase price, plus other extras such as estate agent fees and conveyancing fees make the average cost of just moving home around \u00a311,000.\n\n\u201cIn this climate, it\u2019s no wonder that many people are opting to remortgage to release the money to extend or improve their home instead,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really no surprise given the current political and economic uncertainty that the only area of growth in lending is from homeowners remortgaging for additional borrowing as homeowners look to hunker down, get their finances in order and improve, not move.\u201d\n\nAnd improving they are, with the only increase in mortgage lending coming from those keen to borrow more against their homes to fund improvements \u2013 up by more than 8 per cent year-on-year.\n\nOne study by TSB shows two in five homeowners would now prefer to renovate their home than move, particularly in light of new changes in planning restrictions.\n\nIn May this year, thousands of homeowners were given the green light to extend their properties without planning permission, meaning that homeowners are now able to improve and add value to their existing home through rear extensions.\n\nAs a result of this change in the law, one in five homeowners are now more likely to build a rear extension in the next three years, according to TSB, with half of those saying moving is too expensive, or they are emotionally attached to their current home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that homeowners cite the cost of moving as one of the biggest barriers to affording a new home or moving up the property ladder. Building an extension is a great way to add extra space without having to undertake the additional costs such as stamp duty and legal fees,\u201d says Nick Smith, TSB\u2019s head of mortgages.\n\n\u201cWhere space is at a premium quite simply adding floor area adds value. However, good design, layout and functionality of homes is increasingly important. Home buyers want the space but tasteful extensions and modern open-plan living areas offered by extensions are value generating,\u201c adds James Ginley, technical director for Legal & General Surveying Services.\n\nThe key problem, as ever, is that with Brits spending \u00a383bn on upgrading their home each year, we don\u2019t have the ready money to pay for such improvements.\n\nResearch from Zopa suggests the average adult parts with more than \u00a33,000 every year \u2013 on everything from huge extensions to updating furniture and carpets.\n\nA third of us will remortgage those properties to cover the costs, rising to more than half of the under 34s, says TSB, which also found that 80 per cent of us expect relaxed laws on extensions will also heighten neighbourhood disputes.", "description": "Homebuyers are curbing their desire to move up the notorious property ladder in the face of unrelenting economic and political no man\u2019s land,\u00a0\u200bthe latest figures from the banking world show.\u00a0 Despite the ultra-low cost of borrowing and steady, if not falling, property prices across the country, homeowners are staying put in increasing numbers, according to the latest raft of", "authors": ["Kate Hughes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/16/17/loft-conversion.jpg"}
