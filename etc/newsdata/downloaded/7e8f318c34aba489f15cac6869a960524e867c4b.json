It does appear that natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel that is nonetheless facing increasing opposition from environmentalists and Democratic politicians, is excluded from this definition.\n\nThe intrigue: I just spoke with Bill Farris, an associate laboratory director at the U.S. Energy Department\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory for my recent column on Exxon\u2019s expanding external research funding, including with NREL. He said NREL works with other oil companies too, albeit with distinct focuses, illustrating the different strategies big oil companies are pursuing when it comes to clean tech.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s biofuels for Exxon or smart grids for Shell or offshore wind for Equinor, we try to make the R&D capabilities available.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bill Farris, National Renewable Energy Laboratory\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching: David Doherty, an oil analyst at BloombergNEF, says he expects R&D toward low-carbon to increase alongside what he has seen to be an increase in external investments so far this year.", "description": "The oil industry faces pressure on climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/-T1UCL3s_qsbHOxgV65192u_234=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/10/14/1571077434265.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
