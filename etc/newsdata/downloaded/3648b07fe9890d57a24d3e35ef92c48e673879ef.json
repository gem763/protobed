It has a bit of work to do first.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening? After a dramatic weekend that ultimately resolved very little, Boris Johnson\u2019s government will try again to hold a vote on the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal. That could put him on a collision course with opposition parties, and with Speaker John Bercow.\n\nAnd what actually happened at the weekend? In brief: Parliament voted to delay a decision on Johnson\u2019s revised Brexit deal until enabling legislation is on the statute book. The prime minister vowed not to \u201cnegotiate\u201d an extension to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, but then (as required by law) sent the EU a letter requesting exactly that. He also sent another letter, trying to say that he doesn\u2019t want any delay. Nevertheless, as James Kirkup put it in the Spectator: Boris Johnson \u201ctalked a good fight, then caved.\u201d It\u2019s now in the EU\u2019s hands.\n\nThe government wants to start again, as soon as today. But Bercow might refuse \u2014 he barred former Prime Minister Theresa May from simply trying again with an identical proposal after one of her Brexit deal defeats. And even if Bercow says yes, opponents of Johnson\u2019s Brexit are preparing a raft of amendments that could stymie the passage either of the deal or of accompanying legislation. The pro-Brexit press isn\u2019t thrilled with that.\n\nNo-deal supremo Michael Gove told Sky News on Sunday that he feels a no-deal Brexit is now more likely in the wake of Saturday\u2019s vote to delay. With just 10 days left until Brexit, the government has now activated Operation Yellowhammer, allowing departments to take action to offset worst-case outcomes.\n\nJohnson remains bullish because the way Saturday played out raised his hopes of passing the deal if and when it does come to a vote. Bloomberg\u2019s Rob Hutton and Greg Ritchie have been keeping track of the numbers, and we\u2019ve also mapped how MPs voted on the amendment that scuppered the prime minister\u2019s \u201cSuper Saturday.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Must-Reads\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Tim Ross explains what happens next in Brexit, according to government plans. \u201cHopes have been dashed.\u201d Here\u2019s what market players are saying about the Brexit weekend. Business leaders foresee a Brexit hangover into 2020 no matter what happens this week, Eric Pfanner and Siddarth Philip report, starting with a production shutdown at Jaguar Land Rover early next month. Brussels wants to move on from Brexit, writes Wolfgang Munchau in the Financial Times; no one should underestimate how tense the EU extension debate could become, Lionel Laurent writes for Bloomberg Opinion.\n\nIf you\u2019re enjoying the Brexit Bulletin, or if you think we could do better, we\u2019d love to hear your views.

Analysts are split over what happens next, but see lower risks of a no-deal exit. The pound could rise as high as $1.36 if Parliament backs the deal, according to Credit Agricole.\n\nFungible Prolongation | EU leaders are preparing to offer a flexible extension that would allow the U.K. to exit the EU on a variety of different dates depending on when the necessary legislation is passed, the Times reports.\n\nDon\u2019t Worry | Brexit won\u2019t have a big impact on the European or global economies, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King said, offering a counterpoint to persistent concerns by global policy makers that the move could further dent already-weakening growth.\n\nSpeaking Out | In a not-so-coded dig at Speaker Bercow, one of his deputies, Dame Eleanor Laing, wrote in the Telegraph that his successor must be an \u201cindependent anchor\u201d and set an example through \u201cdignified, respectful behaviour.\u201d\n\nLawyers Watching | Businesswoman Gina Miller, who has twice defeated the government over Brexit in the Supreme Court, says she\u2019ll challenge any bid to scupper a Brexit extension, and will launch a tactical voting website ahead of an upcoming general election to help voters navigate the U.K.\u2019s \u201cimperfect electoral system.\u201d", "description": "Brexit is 10 days away.(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here\u00a0to get the Brexit Bulletin in your inbox every weekday.Today in Brexit:\u00a0The U.K.\u00a0is due to leave the European Union 10 days from now.
