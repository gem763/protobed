Their homes were knocked down and once popular neighbourhoods were turned into modern day ghost towns. It became known as the 'Residential Red Zone' but is in fact a vibrant green. Avonside is pictured in 2009 and again in 2019\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a In the aftermath of the powerful 6.2 magnitude earthquake that struck the city, several areas such as the suburb of Bexley (pictured) were declared to be uninhabitable. While some locals left the area straight away, it was months and years before others packed up and moved out. About 5,500 property owners eventually accepted Crown offers to buy their properties\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The natural disaster claimed the lives of 185 people, left an estimated 2,000 with injuries, and destroyed homes and other buildings throughout the country's second largest city. Horseshoe Lake, once one of the trendiest suburbs in the entire city, is today grassland. Horseshoe Lake and other devastated suburbs are just minutes from Christchurch's central business district\n\nLocated just minutes from the city centre, these suburbs were built on and around wetlands and given names such as Avonside, Dallington, Bexley and Horseshoe Lake.\n\nWhen families and professionals first moved into the area there they fell in love with its tidy streets, convenient amenities and sense of community. It was close to city jobs but quiet and peaceful at the end of the week.\n\nThen just before 1pm on February 22, 2011, many of these residents had their world literally come crashing down around them.\n\nThe ground shook for two straight minutes, but the impact has lasted to this day.\n\nUninhabitable areas were 'red zoned' and those inside its boundaries were known as 'red zoners'. Among them were originally two groups: leavers and stayers. Many of the stayers were uninsured.\n\nWhile some locals left the area straight away, it was months and years before others packed up and moved out.\n\nAbout 5,500 property owners eventually accepted Crown offers to buy their properties.\n\nStuff.co.nz reports that before the earthquake there were more than 10,000 residents in these eastern Christchurch suburbs, while by 2013 that number had dwindled to just 1,300.\n\nAn up-close look at one of the streets within the 'Red Zone' at Dallington which was once lined with homes but today is an overgrown wasteland. The earthquake caused widespread 'liquefaction', in which saturated soil loses its strength and stiffness and behaves more like a liquid than a solid. Structures sank as the ground split beneath its residents' feet\n\nThis image shows the same Dallington street pictured above as it appeared before the devastating 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The neat brick houses, manicured gardens and well-maintained road system are all gone. In their place are vacant blocks, fields of grass and flooded streets. Joggers and dog walkers do not have to compete with cars\n\nToday there are fewer than 100 who still call the place home.\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread 'liquefaction', in which saturated soil loses its strength and stiffness and behaves more like a liquid than a solid. Structures sank as the ground split.\n\nGone are the neat brick houses, manicured gardens and well-maintained road system and and in their place are vacant blocks, fields of grass and flooded streets. Joggers and dog walkers do not have to compete with cars.\n\nSome observers have likened the sight to looking down upon Pripyat, the Ukrainian ghost town left to be reclaimed by forest after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.\n\nBut unlike Pripyat where buildings were left intact, these Christchurch suburbs have been razed. And unlike Pripyat, the Red Zone presents a rare opportunity for a large portion of a modern city to be returned to nature.\n\nThe entire Red Zone, which covers an area of about 600 rugby fields, is the subject of the largest regeneration project in New Zealand's history but for now looks like it is reverting to swampland.\n\nCrumbling roads are still clearly visible in some suburbs but in others are now permanently a metre under water and can only be traced by rows of listing street lamps and sagging power poles. Pictured is a native pukeko swamphen wading in a street\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The suburbs in east Christchurch designated part of the 'Red Zone' were once full of residents, but now resemble ghost towns. The Red Zone, which covers 600 hectares, is the subject of the largest regeneration project in New Zealand's history\n\nAlmost a decade after the earthquake once-familiar suburb names have been removed from maps and the only landmark not immediately threatened with disappearing into the landscape is the Avon River.\n\nCrumbling roads are still clearly visible in some suburbs but in others are now permanently a metre under water and can only be traced by rows of listing street lamps and sagging power poles.\n\nDucks paddle across flooded asphalt, pukeko swamphens wade through roadside pools and a colony of Canada geese has populated the entire district.\n\nIt is obvious now that some parts of some suburbs should never have been built upon.\n\nVarious areas withing the Red Zone have been managed differently since the earthquake depending on how they were categorised. Parts were declared dunes, wet areas, estuarine edges and grasslands.\n\nUninhabitable areas on Christchurch were 'red zoned' and those inside its boundaries were known as 'red zoners'. Among them were originally two groups: leavers and stayers. Many of the stayers were uninsured. About 100 people live here now\n\nOvergrown grass, rusted equipment and graffiti deter children from playing on a once popular playground. For a time the army used abandoned houses for training. It has been proposed empty streets could one day be used to test driverless cars\n\nWhile parts have been left alone to be reclaimed by native vegetation while others have been planted with exotic grasses and are regularly mown.\n\nSome properties have sunk so low they are now below sea level and whole suburbs are merging with surrounding wetland. The only way to travel through the Red Zone is on foot or bicycle.\n\nFor a time the army used abandoned houses for training and it has been proposed empty streets could one day be used to test driverless cars.\n\nWhile most backyards have not been maintained for years some former homeowners still return to examine or tend their old gardens.\n\nWith the people now long gone and the houses knocked down, the next step is to turn this suburban wasteland back into an area that is attractive and safe to visit once again.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Cul de sacs such as Goodman Street at Horseshoe Lake (pictured) were once full of homes where locals planned to live and never leave. While the area will never be inhabited, the government has announced plans to regenerate the eastern corridor\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Rows of houses once lined these Christchurch streets at Dallington but while the roads remain all homes have been knocked down. The next step is to turn this suburban wasteland back into an area that is attractive and safe to visit once again\n\nThe Red Zone is these days formally known as the Otakaro Avon River Corridor and covers 602 hectares.\n\nBy comparison, Sydney's Centennial Park is 189 hectares, London's Hyde Park 140 hectares and New York's Central Park 341 hectares.\n\nWhile the area will likely never be inhabited, the New Zealand government has recently announced plans to regenerate the eastern corridor.\n\nThose plans include cafes, shops, bike tracks and facilities for kayaking on the wetlands and river. A walking path would meander from the city to the sea.\n\nA 'Green Spine' would be at the core of the proposed parkland, 11 kilometres long and extending out up to 150 metres from both sides of the river, with seating, picnic and barbecue areas.\n\nAccording to the government, the proposed project 'emphasises the connection between people, communities, the river, the land and new possibilities.'", "description": "Incredible pictures have emerged showing the difference between inner suburban Christchurch before the 2011 earthquake and what those neighbourhoods look like today.", "authors": ["Josh Hanrahan And Stephen Gibbs For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/07/19241212-0-image-a-10_1570085128100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
