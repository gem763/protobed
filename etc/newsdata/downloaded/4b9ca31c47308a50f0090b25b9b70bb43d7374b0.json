Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, yet I am one of the lucky ones. People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\n\nThunberg challenged the idea that current global emissions reduction targets are enough to curb the devastating and irreversible effects of severe climate change, again calling for a radical transformation of the planet\u2019s leading economies to address the issue.\n\n\u201cA 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us, we who have to live with the consequences,\u201d Thunberg said.\n\nThe didn\u2019t drop the mic so much as she dropped the hammer.\n\n\u201cYou are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say \u2018we will never forgive you.'\u201d\n\nHer speech marks a high point in her year-long campaign for climate justice, which started with her simple, solitary decision to skip school in Sweden.\n\nWhether her speech has any lasting impact is yet to be seen.\n\nThe ongoing Climate Action Summit, the most significant gathering of its kind since the 2015 Paris UN Climate Change Conference, has gathered diplomats in the hopes they\u2019ll reveal new emission reduction targets which heed the warnings of last year\u2019s ground-shaking Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.\n\nOf course, some nations (like Australia) are expected to reveal less than others at the conference, but Thunberg\u2019s speech has rendered the issue in no unclear terms: to deny the science is to permit untold suffering on future generations.", "description": "The 16-year-old activist laid waste to the adults who refuse to avert catastrophe.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/greta-1-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
