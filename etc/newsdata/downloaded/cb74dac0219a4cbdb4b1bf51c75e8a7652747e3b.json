How we are treating other human beings, it\u2019s just appalling.\u201d\n\nEva Longoria went on to make the case often made by the neoliberal wing of the Republican Party that America\u2019s industries need more migrant labor.\n\n\u201cSo we need the economic imperative argument, right?\u201d Longoria said. \u201cWe cannot deny that we have major industries dependent on immigrant labor. More than agriculture \u2014 it\u2019s not just agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the truth of the matter is this country does not work without the engine of the immigrant community and the engine of immigrant labor,\u201d she later added.\n\nThe 44-year-old former Desperate Housewives star also urged Americans to hold lawmakers accountable \u201cin a loud way.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy biggest message is don\u2019t let the media dictate the divides that we have in this country,\u201d she declared.\n\nLongoria is one of Hollywood\u2019s most fervent anti-Trump activists, having previously compared him to Adolf Hitler. Last year, she falsely claimed that as a multi-millionaire Hispanic woman, she was being \u201cattacked daily\u201d by the policies of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cAs a Latino I\u2019m personally invested because I\u2019m attacked daily by this administration,\u201d Longoria said at the time. \u201cI mean from day one, for them to attack my community and all brown people to be murderers and rapists is a problem.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Actress Eva Longoria slammed President Donald Trump's \"inhumane\" policies on illegal immigration on Tuesday and said a moral argument on the issue is not changing hearts and minds.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/EvaLongoria1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
