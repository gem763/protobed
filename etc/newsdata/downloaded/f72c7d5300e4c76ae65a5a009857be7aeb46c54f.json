My little daughter?! \u2026 Don\u2019t ever talk about a child like that!\u2019\n\nKourtney was also furious with Corey\u2019s comment and later said: \u2018Because he will never be with my kids alone and if he does that in front of any of us there will be a f***ing issue!\u2019\n\nIn a confessional interview, Corey then explained: \u2018I understand how Kourtney and Scott feel but I can say what I want to say because that\u2019s my opinion. I hope that everyone is able to move on.\u2019\n\nThe tension later simmered when Corey and Kourtney had a heart-to-heart.\n\nKourtney, 40, later reiterated that she is against beating or smacking children as punishment.\n\n\u2018In my opinion, beating children is not [how] to \u201cget your kids in check. When children are hurting or frustrated, the answer is not to physically hurt them [sic],\u2019 she tweeted.\n\nThe Kardashians are certainly making the most of their trip to Armenia as they enjoyed a swanky dinner with President Armen Sarkissian at the presidential palace.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
