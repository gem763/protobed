It refrained from recommending an overhaul after its first review in 2014, but at that time rules had not been properly tested.\n\nThe outcome may be different now as Germany, the bloc's traditional economic motor, is on the brink of recession with officials in Berlin openly suggesting they could pump money into the economy to counter any significant slowdown.", "description": "The European Union is bracing for a review of its strict fiscal rules as the bloc's economy slows, while monetary stimulus is seen as being close to its limits, according to an EU document and officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105680369-1547591878680rts2arca.jpg?v=1547591949", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
