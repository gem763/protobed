He gave us his word, but in the end he couldn't continue.\"\n\n(Image: TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Ima)\n\nSpain were behind at the time of De Gea's departure thanks to Marcus Berg's goal 10 minutes earlier but substitute Rodrigo poked home from close range in stoppage time to seal the point that Spain needed to confirm their place at Euro 2020.\n\nUnited, meanwhile, are currently just two points above the relegation zone and in desperate need of a result against the Reds, who are unbeaten in their opening eight fixtures.\n\nTo make matters worse for United, table toppers Liverpool, who are aiming to continue their 100 per cent start to the season, are expected to welcome first choice Alisson back after his injury.", "description": "De Gea suffered the injury in the second-half of Spain\u2019s 1-1 draw with Sweden in a Euro 2020 qualifier, forcing him out of the game", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Anders Wiklund Tt Epa-Efe Rex", "Tt News Agency Afp Via Getty Ima"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587472.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sweden-vs-Spain-Stockholm-15-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
