Field\u2019s move follows claims that selected Labour MPs in the North and Midlands are be offered \u2018Brexit bribes\u2019 of massive Government investment in their constituencies if they back the deal.\n\nOne senior Labour Brexiteer and northern MP rejected the claims yesterday and party whips claimed any revolt would be restricted to no more than five \u2013 the same number which backed Theresa May\u2019s deal. But The Mail on Sunday understands that Mr Johnson will use the Queen\u2019s Speech to unveil major projects in the North. Sources said the aim would be to tackle the North/South divide with a series of \u2018prosperity funds\u2019 for specific regions.\n\nMr Corbyn (pictured left) is hoping to kill the rebellion aimed at defying him as he claims the Tories wanted \u2018a Trump-deal Brexit that would crash our economy'. He insisted that 'no Labour MP could support such a reckless deal'\n\nAt conference last week, the Prime Minister reiterated his wish to \u2018level up\u2019 all parts of the UK and re-affirmed his backing for a new high-speed rail link between the Manchester and Leeds.\n\nMr Corbyn has sought to kill any rebellion, claiming the Tories wanted \u2018a Trump-deal Brexit that would crash our economy\u2019 and vowing: \u2018No Labour MP could support such a reckless deal\u2019.\n\nMr Field, 77, who cited anti-Semitism and \u2018nastiness\u2019 in Labour when he quit the party in 2018 after 58 years, plans to stand as the Birkenhead Social Justice candidate at the next Election.", "description": "Left-wing MP Frank Field says some Labour MPs in the North and Midlands are being offered 'Brexit Bribes' if they back their party's deal.
