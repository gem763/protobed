(AP) - Justin Fields has been sensational in four games. Now it\u2019s time to see what he can do in a hostile environment.\n\nFields leads fifth-ranked Ohio State into its toughest game to date when it visits 90,000-seat Memorial Stadium to play Nebraska on Saturday night.\n\nThe transfer from Georgia has had a hand in 19 touchdowns, and the Buckeyes have outscored their competition 214-36. That includes a 41-point win at Indiana, where thousands of Ohio State fans made their presence felt throughout the stadium.\n\nBut a nationally televised night game, in front of a crowd jazzed up by a morning visit from ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d and an afternoon of pregaming in campus parking lots and downtown Lincoln, should make for a rowdy atmosphere.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make a game bigger than it is,\u201d Fields said. \u201cIf you do that, I guess you\u2019ll end up not playing to your full potential. So just treating this like any other game and doing the same things we\u2019ve been doing the past four weeks\u2026 I think the team is just going to play our game, and if we do that it will be enough to win the game.\u201d\n\nThe Buckeyes (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) had their way with the Cornhuskers the last time they played in Lincoln, winning 56-14 against the Mike Riley-coached team that was about to go into a free fall to end the 2017 season.\n\nScott Frost\u2019s first Nebraska team played Ohio State to within 36-31 in Columbus last year, and the Huskers (3-1, 1-0) believe they have narrowed the gap physically since then. Things also have changed mentally.\n\n\u201cI would just say the confidence that we belong on the same field with them and that we can play them as closely as possible, believing we can win if we play our best football,\u201d linebacker Mohamed Barry said.\n\nNebraska quarterback Adrian Martinez has been inconsistent through three games but played some of the best ball of his career in bringing his team back from a two-touchdown deficit in the second half to win at Illinois last week. Martinez played a strong game against the Buckeyes last season, and this year the Huskers have a new threat in freshman running back-wide receiver Wan\u2019Dale Robinson.\n\nThe Huskers\u2019 defense has improved up front and should put up more resistance to Buckeyes running back J.K. Dobbins, who ran for 163 yards and three touchdowns in last year\u2019s game and 106 yards and a TD the year before. He comes into the game second in Big Ten rushing at 119 yards per game.\n\n\u201cGot a real big challenge ahead of us this week, by far the best team that we\u2019ve played,\u201d first-year Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. \u201cNot only just talent and coaching but also the environment we\u2019re going to be walking into. Scott has done a great job of building this team up.\u201d\n\nTHE 900 CLUB\n\nThis will be the second game to match programs that have at least 900 all-time wins. Ohio State has 915, Nebraska reached 900 last week. Michigan-Ohio State last year was the first such game.\n\nTHE KELLY CONNECTION\n\nDay and Frost both have worked for Chip Kelly, regarded as the most innovative offensive coach in the nation when he was at Oregon from 2009-12. Day, who succeeded Urban Meyer at Ohio State, played quarterback at New Hampshire when Kelly was offensive coordinator. Day also was Kelly\u2019s QB coach for two years in the NFL. Frost was Kelly\u2019s receivers coach at Oregon.\n\n\u201cI met Ryan for the first time at a Chip Kelly golf tournament in Maine many years ago,\u201d Frost said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job everywhere he\u2019s gone. He\u2019s climbed the coaching ranks and landed in a pretty good spot. There\u2019s no question in my mind that Ohio State is a better team than they were a year ago.\u201d\n\nFIELDS THE PHENOM\n\nFields became the first Big Ten player with a passing and rushing touchdown in each of his first four games since Antwaan Randle El of Indiana in 1999. In last week\u2019s 76-5 win over Miami (Ohio), Fields had four passing TDs and two rushing TDs in the second quarter.\n\nTOUGH D\n\nOhio State has held its first four opponents to fewer than 300 yards of total offense for the first time since 1996. Opponents have scored touchdowns on just 18% of their red zone opportunities (2 of 11). Chase Young is the national co-leader with seven sacks.\n\nGOING FOR A BIG PELT\n\nNebraska is 0-9 against top-five opponents since beating then-No. 2 Oklahoma 20-10 in Lincoln in 2001. The Huskers have lost eight straight against Top 25 teams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Justin Fields has been sensational in four games.
