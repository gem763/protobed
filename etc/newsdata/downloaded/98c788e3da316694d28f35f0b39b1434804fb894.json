The chairmen of each panel is looking to determine whether Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine to pressure leader Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, if Sondland will appear. The New York Times reported Tuesday the White House has ordered the ambassador not to testify.\n\nSondland, a wealthy hotelier and longtime Republican donor, has so far been vocal in his support for the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. The committees interviewed two former diplomatic officials in the inquiry last week.\n\nSondland, 62, is one the diplomats involved in numerous text messages released by the committees last week that show discussions about Trump and a July phone call with Zelensky, which was the subject of at least one whistle-blower report.\n\nIn the messages, diplomat William Taylor expressed concern about Trump pressuring Zelensky.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor said in a Sept. 9 text message.\n\nHours later, Sondland replied, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo of any kind,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nTaylor signaled in one message he might resign over frustration with how the situation was being handled.\n\nThe committees are expected to press Sondland about the text messages and any follow-up phone calls.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re confusing international cooperation on economic and military and security objectives with the president converting the office of the presidency into an instrument of re-election and an instrument of private self-enrichment,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told CNN Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s what this president has done.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, however, cite Sondland\u2019s text messages as proof that Trump did nothing wrong \u2014 since he states in one message that Trump\u2019s intention was not to use the Congress-approved military aid as leverage to investigate the Bidens.\n\nTrump appointed Sondland to the ambassador post last year, to succeed Obama-era diplomat Anthony Gardner.\n\nThe committee chairmen on Monday formally subpoenaed records, to be turned over by Oct. 15, from the Defense Department and White House budget office \u2014 and requested the same from the White House and Vice President Mike Pence last weekend.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union is scheduled to testify Tuesday before three House committees that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
