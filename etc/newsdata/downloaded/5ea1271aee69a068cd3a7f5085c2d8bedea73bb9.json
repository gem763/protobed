Trump has not provided evidence to support the accusation and Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHere are some details about Trump\u2019s allegations:\n\nON WHAT BASIS IS TRUMP CALLING FOR A PROBE OF HUNTER BIDEN?\n\nTrump has alleged that Hunter Biden got China to invest $1.5 billion in a fund he was involved in soon after accompanying his father on a trip to Beijing in December 2013, when Joe Biden was vice president.\n\n\u201cWhen Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund, and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China, and he\u2019s there for one quick meeting and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that\u2019s a horrible thing,\u201d Trump said last month.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics say the president is trying to divert attention from an impeachment inquiry being pursued by Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\u201cNow, with his administration in free-fall, Donald Trump is flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organizations,\u201d Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nWHAT ARE HUNTER BIDEN\u2019S INVESTMENTS?\n\nIn 2009, Hunter Biden co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners, along with Christopher Heinz, stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry, and Devon Archer, an American businessman who was Heinz\u2019s classmate at Yale University.\n\nIn 2012, the younger Biden and Archer talked to Chinese private equity investor Jonathan Li about joining forces on a fund that would invest Chinese capital - and possibly capital from other countries - outside of China, the New Yorker magazine reported in a profile of Hunter Biden in July.\n\nLi, Archer and others agreed in 2013 to establish the fund, called BHR Partners, and Hunter Biden joined as an unpaid member of the board, the New Yorker said.\n\nHunter Biden told the New Yorker that he met Li during the December 2013 trip but described it as social encounter. \u201cHow do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them see (Li) for a cup of coffee?\u201d he said.\n\nGeorge Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, has said his client started out on the advisory board for BHR and only became an investor in the fund with a 10% stake in 2017.\n\nMesires has said Hunter Biden\u2019s investment in the fund was $420,000, implying a total capitalization for the fund of $4.2 million.\n\nNeither Hunter Biden nor Mesires could be reached for comment.\n\nBHR\u2019s investments span a range of industries and companies, including one of the China\u2019s main nuclear energy firms, China General Nuclear Power Corp, and AI startup Megvii Technology Ltd, also known as Face++.\n\nIn 2015, BHR joined forces with AVIC Auto, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the country\u2019s dominant aerospace and defense contractor, to buy Henniges Automotive, a U.S. auto-parts company.\n\nThat deal was subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and last month Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley raised concern about the CFIUS process, citing potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWHERE DID THE $1.5 BILLION FIGURE COME FROM?\n\nBHR\u2019s website says it is the cross-border investment arm of a state-approved Chinese private equity firm and is supported by some of China\u2019s largest financial institutions, including the Bank of China.\n\nAn archived version of BHR\u2019s website from 2014 says BHR was formed in 2013 by two Chinese asset managers alongside Rosemont Seneca Partners and Thornton Group LLC.\n\nThe $1.5 billion figure cited by Trump may come from conservative author Peter Schweizer\u2019s 2018 book \u201cSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends\u201d.\n\nSchweizer\u2019s book referenced a July 2014 Wall Street Journal article that said the BHR consortium aimed to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China, citing a Bank of China spokesman.\n\nBHR did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nFrom the beginning, the firm appeared to be aiming to leverage its ties to state-backed lenders to make big investments.\n\nBHR would \u201cconcentrate on ultra-large-scale and internationally influential projects in the future\u201d, Li was quoted as saying in a February 2014 article in the state-owned 21st Century Business Herald.\n\n\u201cProjects with less than $100 million will be considered only if there are special advantages,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe strong background of the state-owned shareholders will help BHR\u2019s large-scale investment and M&A projects.\u201d\n\nLi did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe New Yorker reported in its July article that Hunter Biden and his business partners said they had yet to receive a payment from BHR.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called on China to investigate Joe Biden, a main Democratic contender in the 2020 race for the White House, about the involvement of his son in a fund that sought to raise Chinese capital.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
