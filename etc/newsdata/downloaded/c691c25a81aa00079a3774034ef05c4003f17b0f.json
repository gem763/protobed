Instead the state is now starkly divided between the hard-Left and the hard-Right.\n\nThe result will be seen as personal vindication for Mr Ramelow, Germany\u2019s first regional prime minister from the Left Party, a successor to the former East German communist party.\n\n\u201cI see myself strengthened. My party has a clear mandate to form the next government,\u201d a triumphant Mr Ramelow said.\n\nBodo Ramelow claimed a mandate to govern after his Left Party came first but fell short of a majority Credit: FILIP SINGER/EPA-EFE/REX More\n\nBut the results were also a success for Mr H\u00f6cke, the most controversial figure within the AfD, who more than doubled his party\u2019s share of the vote since the last election in 2014.\n\n\u201cGains of more than 100 per cent have never been recorded before in the history of Thuringia,\u201d a gleeful Mr H\u00f6cke told German television. \u201cThis is a sign that a large part of Thuringia says: \u2018No more!\u2019\u201d\n\nMr H\u00f6cke is under observation by German intelligence as a possible threat to the democratic order. In the course of the campaign he was described as a \u201cNazi\u201d by the regional leader of Mrs Merkel\u2019s party, and accused by the German interior minister of personally stoking an atmosphere of anti-Semitism that led to this month\u2019s failed far-Right attack on a synagogue in Halle.\n\nBut he shrugged all that off to inflict heavy losses on his rivals. Although he did not match the 27.5 per cent the AfD won in Saxony earlier this year, he arguably scored a more telling blow by beating the CDU into third place.\n\nHe will now be expected to look to use that success to strengthen his position against his more moderate rivals within the AfD.\n\nFor Mrs Merkel\u2019s party, the results were disastrous. \u201cFor the democratic centre this is a bitter result,\u201d Mike Mohring, the regional CDU leader said. \u201cFor the first time a centrist government is not possible.\u201d\n\nTalks on forming a new regional government are expected to be protracted. Although Mr Ramelow claimed a mandate, he failed to secure a majority and there is no obvious coalition.\n\nWith the CDU refusing to join any coalition that includes the Left Party, and all other parties ruling out any alliance with the AfD, Mr Ramelow may be forced into forming a minority government.", "description": "The nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) made sweeping gains in regional elections on Sunday, inflicting heavy losses on Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU).\u00a0 Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a politician who has been compared to Hitler by German national television, led the AfD to second place in the eastern", "authors": ["Justin Huggler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NTrf9O9LGqim6eDPSPLYfg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/d2136a3df9108ec0f05ef1007646f325", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
