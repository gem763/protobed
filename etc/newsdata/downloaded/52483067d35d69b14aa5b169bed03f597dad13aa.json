You are 23 years of age and you were found guilty of assault by beating and causing actual bodily harm while on a busy train, which in my view, was deeply unpleasant and animalistic.\n\n(Image: Vagner Vidal/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\n\"Your sarcastic demeanour could be seen on the CCTV footage as you pulled a victim's hair hard and removed it from her head in clumps.\n\n\"What ensued can only be described as a scrum and you lost control of yourself. Miss Marabet was trying to get past you when her leg was bitten causing a permanent scar and needing tetanus jabs.\"\n\nThe judge added that Peereboom's previous warning in 2011 for biting a police officer when she was 15 years old and her difficult upbringing, having been put in care at the age of 14, had to be taken into consideration.\n\nShe suggested that under the exceptional circumstances. she was going to defer sentencing for two months while Peereboom could either find a place to live in the UK to undertake her unpaid work or get herself a job to pay compensation.", "description": "Eliza Peereboom was convicted of sinking her teeth into a woman's leg as she returned home from boozy day at Newbury races", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Vagner Vidal Hyde News", "Pictures Ltd"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20556689.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Jury-hears-how-actress-bit-girl-and-pulled-others-hair.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
