There was a 33,000 BOPD decline in crude oil production in June. While the analysts assume that there will be an even larger decline in July.\n\nProduction dropped due to a fall in active drilling rig count. This is due to Hurricane Barry shutting down rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and the oil supply glut. In 2010, the shale revolution not only provided Americans with surplus cheap oil but also dealt a strong blow to the major oil producers in the world.\n\nA surge in shale production has lowered oil prices forcing oil and gas companies to reduce drilling to cut down budget. The OPEC and OPEC+ (includes countries that do not fall in the OPEC cartel) have been slashing production since the end of 2017 to force the rise in oil price, but the United States administration is ready to sell oil at a lower price to become the dominator in the market.\n\nAnother event that boosted oil price was Saudi Arabia appointing a new oil minister right before the IPO of its pride possession, Saudi Aramco. Khalid al-Falih was replaced by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman who will be the first member of the royal family to run the oil ministry. This news has helped oil prices gain traction and will boost the IPO of Aramco to reach the expected $3 trillion.\n\nOil prices further moved north after both the United States and China agreed to meet in October to resolve trade-related issues. Needless to say, that a predominant factor causing oil prices to drop heavily since 2018 is the trade war between the two largest economies in the world.\n\nChina is one of the largest importers of oil in the world. Since the rift in trade, China slashed its crude oil purchase from the United States and imposed additional 5% tariffs on crude oil imports on Sep 1, dampening the sentiments of U.S. oil manufacturers.\n\n4 Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nIt seems that the aforesaid factors will help oil prices to rise further, and with the United States trying to become the oil dominator, the future of the commodity is bright.
