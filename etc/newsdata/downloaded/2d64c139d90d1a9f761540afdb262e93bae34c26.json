I just hear that it's a partisan person,\" Mr Trump said earlier this week.\n\n\"I don't know who the whistleblower is,\" acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, the leader of the intelligence community, said on Thursday.\n\nFederal whistleblowers have strong protections under a special law governing officials wanting to report wrongdoing by colleagues or superiors, but they have to go through a strictly defined process.\n\nMr Maguire said the person acted \"by the book.\"\n\n\"I think the whistleblower did everything in the right way,\" he told the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nTRUMP: 'ALMOST A SPY'\n\nBut protecting the person could be hard. Mr Bakaj has agreed to have them appear behind closed doors at the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to answer questions about the complaint.\n\nMr Trump has already launched a campaign of personal attacks, accusing the whistleblower of relying on secondary reports from others in the intelligence community and holding a bias against the president.\n\n\"Who is this so-called 'whistleblower' who doesn't know the correct facts. Is he on our Country's side\" Mr Trump asked in a tweet this week.\n\nAnd on Thursday, Mr Trump appeared to threaten them.\n\n\"They're almost a spy,\" Mr Trump said in a private meeting, according to a recording published by the Los Angeles times.\n\n\"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nPRAISE FOR COMING FORWARD\n\nBut many others praised the person for risking their career and possibly personal safety by coming forward.\n\n\"I want to thank the whistleblower for their courage. They didn't have to step forward,\" said Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in a hearing on the complaint Thursday.\n\nMr Bakaj would not confirm The New York Times report that the whistleblower works for the CIA.\n\nBut he assailed the newspaper for endangering the person.\n\n\"Any decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistleblower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm's way,\" The New York Times quoted Mr Bakaj as saying.\n\n\"The whistleblower has a right to anonymity.\"\n\nThe nonprofit group Whistleblower Aid opened a public donation site seeking funds for the person's legal fees on Wednesday.\n\n\"The US intelligence officer who filed an urgent report of government misconduct needs your help,\" the group said.\n\n\"This brave individual took an oath to protect and defend our Constitution.\"\n\nOne day after the launch, the site had raised more than US$79,000 from around 2,200 donors.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [WASHINGTON] Only a handful of people know his or her identity, but the whistleblower whose complaint threatens to implode Donald Trump's presidency is already being lauded as both a hero and a traitor. .
