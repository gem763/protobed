According to an autopsy report released Monday by the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office, Ocasek died of cardiovascular disease. Ocasek was 75.\n\nThe specific cause of death was listed as hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or atherosclerosis, a build-up of plaque in the arteries that can cause hardening and/or narrowing in the heart muscle. Pulmonary emphysema was also a contributing factor.\n\nThe autopsy findings coincide with two touching social media posts by the Ocasek family that have provided deeper insight in the singer-songwriter\u2019s final hours. The first post, by Ocasek\u2019s wife Paulina Porizkova (from whom he amicably separated in 2018) says the new wave pioneer died in his sleep after undergoing surgery.\n\n\u201cRic was at home recuperating very well after surgery. Our two sons, Jonathan and Oliver, and I were making sure he was comfortable, ordering food and watching TV together,\u201d Porizkova wrote. \u201cI found him still asleep when bringing him his Sunday morning coffee. I touched his cheek to rouse him. It was then I realized that during the night he had peacefully passed on. We appreciate the great outpouring of love. We, his family and friends, are completely and utterly devastated by his untimely and unexpected death and would appreciate the privacy to mourn in private.\u201d\n\nFrom Ric\u2019s sons: Our dad was a prolific doodler. His passing was sudden, unexpected, and beyond heartbreaking. Yesterday, we found this last doodle on his armchair. He couldn\u2019t have known what it would end up meaning to us. We love him so much. pic.twitter.com/bJNpXSQgDO \u2014 The Cars (@thecarsband) September 16, 2019\n\nJonathan and Oliver also tweeted, via the Cars\u2019 official account, the final drawing by their father, a gifted mixed-media artist who regularly showcased his drawings, photo collages, and paintings. \u201cOur dad was a prolific doodler. His passing was sudden, unexpected, and beyond heartbreaking. Yesterday, we found this last doodle on his armchair. He couldn\u2019t have known what it would end up meaning to us. We love him so much.\u201d Ocasek\u2019s charming pen-and-paper sketch reads, \u201cKeep on laughin\u2019. It is what it is.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Porizkova took to Instagram to thank the fans who have left flowers and vigil candles outside Ocasek\u2019s Manhattan townhouse.\n\nOcasek is survived by his six sons, the other four being Christopher, Adam, Eron, and Derek Otcasek from his two previous marriages.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
