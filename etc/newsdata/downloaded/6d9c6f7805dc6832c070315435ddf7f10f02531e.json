So was Cristiano Ronaldo\u2018s.\n\nEngland made it four wins out of four in Group A with a 5-3 win over Kosovo and Ronaldo netted four goals in European champion Portugal\u2019s 5-1 away win at Lithuania.\n\nOn a night of heavy scoring, it took the five-time Golden Ball winner\u2019s international tally to a whopping 93. Ronaldo might well hit the century mark before next year\u2019s tournament, considering Portugal still faces Lithuania at home and twice plays lowly Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through a good phase, but the team has been playing well too,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying this moment not only because of my goals, but also because of the team\u2019s performances in recent years. I just have to keep helping the team.\u201d\n\nStriker Harry Kane moved onto a more modest 26 for England, whose fans got a jolt when midfielder Valon Berisha put the visiting side ahead after just 35 seconds.\n\nThey were soon reassured by Raheem Sterling\u2019s equalizer and Kane\u2019s latest goal for England, both inside the opening 20 minutes at St. Mary\u2019s Stadium in Southampton on a rare occasion England wasn\u2019t playing at Wembley Stadium.\n\nBy halftime fans had been treated to five home goals, including 19-year-old winger Jadon Sancho scoring his first two for England.\n\nBut the second half proved more inspiring for Kosovo\u2019s fans as they witnessed a mini-comeback, with Berisha enjoying a memorable night with a fine second goal curled into the top corner. Kane could have netted a brace, too, but saw his penalty saved by Arijanet Muric.\n\nWorld Cup winner France labored at times against a well-organized Andorra side in a 3-0 home win, with Barcelona forward Antoine Griezmann missing a penalty for the second straight qualifier.\n\nAfter Kingsley Coman found a way through in the first half, center half Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet and substitute Wissam Ben Yedder added goals after the break.\n\nDEFENSE IN QUESTION\n\nEngland\u2019s attack is purring with 19 goals in four games, but alarming questions will be asked of the defense.\n\nFrom a commanding position of 5-1 up, England leaked two goals after the break - one of those a penalty conceded by the expensively-acquired Manchester United center back Harry Maguire.\n\nKosovo\u2019s opening goal was the result of a careless pass from defender Michael Keane.\n\nEngland still hasn\u2019t lost a qualifier for either the World Cup or European Championship in 10 years. But coach Gareth Southgate knows his defense has to eradicate such sloppy errors if his side wants to win Euro 2020.\n\n\u201cThe outstanding play was obvious,\u201d Southgate said, \u201cand the errors were obvious.\u201d\n\nThe Czech Republic overtook Kosovo to move into second place in Group A with nine points after a 3-0 win at Montenegro and hosts England on Oct. 11.\n\nRAMPAGING RONALDO\n\nRonaldo scored from the penalty spot in the seventh minute, before Lithuania hit back through Vytautas Andriuskevicius\u2019 header.\n\nPortugal\u2019s second goal was given to Ronaldo before being changed to an own goal, and then given back to him on UEFA\u2019s website. The bizarre-looking 62nd-minute effort was a low shot from outside the area. It was saved by Lithuania goalkeeper Ernestas Setkus, before the ball bounced off the goalkeeper\u2019s back and went in.\n\nThree minutes later, Ronaldo tapped in from Bernardo Silva\u2019s pass, and the attacking midfielder set him up again in the 76th.\n\nWilliam Carvalho completed the scoring in stoppage time against last-place Lithuania.\n\nPortugal is second in Group B with eight points and five behind Ukraine, which has 13 points having played one game more.\n\nPowerful striker Aleksandar Mitrovic netted twice as third-place Serbia won 3-1 away to Luxembourg.\n\nPENALTY FLOP\n\nGriezmann remains stuck on 29 international goals after hitting his spot kick too close to goalkeeper Josep Gomes in a one-sided first half where France largely struggled to turn possession into chances.\n\nComan pounced in the 18th after latching onto Jonathan Ikone\u2019s pass behind the defense for his third goal in two France games.\n\nGriezmann\u2019s curling free kick from the left was headed in by Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet soon after the break.\n\nSubstitute Wissam Ben Yedder added the third during injury time, steering the ball in from close range after Nabil Fekir\u2019s free kick was spilled by Gomes.\n\nTurkey and France top Group H with 15 points and meet at Stade de France on Oct. 14.\n\nStriker Cenk Tosun netted twice in Turkey\u2019s 4-0 win at Moldova.\n\nThird-place Iceland slipped three points behind the top two after losing 4-2 away to Albania.\n\nAndorra has scored no goals and conceded 14 in six defeats.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "England's scoring form was on display again in European Championships qualifying on Tuesday.
