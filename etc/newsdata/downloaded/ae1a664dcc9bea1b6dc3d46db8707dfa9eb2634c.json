This step leaves us no alternative but to follow through in due course with our own tariffs in the Boeing case, where the U.S. has been found in breach of WTO rules,\u201d Malmstrom said.\n\nThe WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. The United States imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU imports on Friday. An adjudication on damages in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020.", "description": "The European Union will impose its own tariffs \"in due course\" in its WTO dispute over aircraft subsidies after the United States hit EU imports with increased duties related to illegal subsidies for Airbus, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442266884&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H14U", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
