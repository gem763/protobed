Her food bill is probably around \u00a320 extra a week.\u201d", "description": "The Worcestershire couple are now the proud owners of a huge pig named Grace", "authors": ["Martin Fricker", "Image", "Dave Evitts", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642363.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_HOME_PIG_011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
