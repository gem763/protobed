Ravi, had represented one of the complainants in the failed appeal in 2014.\n\nAfter the Indian decision, a challenge against the law was lodged by Singaporean DJ Johnson Ong - known as DJ Big Kid - in September.\n\nAnother was filed in November by Bryan Choong, an LGBT rights advocate.\n\nWhile affluent Singapore boasts a modern and vibrant culture, official attitudes towards being gay remain conservative, although support for same-sex rights is growing.", "description": "A Singaporean gay rights activist says he has filed a legal challenge against a law banning sex between men, the third recent bid to overturn the legislation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9401/c91c427f2db5459daae335f37b411eb9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
