Even today, I made the reservation for the ticket in advance, but I'm still on the wait list. I'll probably have to take the Mugunghwa train now.\"\"I heard the strike lasts for three days. I hope customers don't experience too many problems. Especially as the strike lasts during the weekend, I feel there's difficulty booking tickets.\"The union and KORAIL have held more than dozen rounds of talks since May, but couldn't narrow their differences.\"The union is demanding higher pay for KORAIL workers, the hiring of more workers, and better working conditions. It says it will launch another strike in November if the demands are not met.\"This is the first time in three years the Korean Railway Workers' Union has launched a strike.There was transport chaos in South Korea in late 2016 when they walked off the job for 74 days.Kim Jae-hee, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
