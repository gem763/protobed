Separatists have called a general strike and a rally on Friday against the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to jail the separatist leaders for their role in a referendum banned by Madrid and a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, around 25,000 striking students and their supporters took part in a midday rally outside Barcelona city hall, according to municipal police. Thousands more are on a cross-country march towards Barcelona for Friday\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cThe actions we have been staging over the past few days testify to the helplessness we feel as the Spanish state continues to reject (independence) and threaten us, while Europe remains silent,\u201d a 23-year-old accountant, who would only give his first name as David, told AFP.\n\nEduard Salinero, a 21-year-old physics student who is in favour of secession, said many people who want Catalonia to remain a part of Spain back the protests \u201cbecause they feel it is totally unfair to send our elected politicians to jail\u201d.\n\nActivists blocked several roads across Catalonia by burning tyres while the commuter rail service in Barcelona was intermittently disrupted due to demonstrators on the tracks, officials said.\n\nSeveral roads and highways were also blocked off due to the mass marches which departed on Wednesday from five Catalan towns heading for Barcelona.\n\nXenia Cabeza, 18, said she was protesting \u201cbecause they don\u2019t let us vote in a referendum\u201d on secession. She carried a sign that read \u201cYou can\u2019t imprison an entire people\u201d.\n\nAnnounced Monday morning, the verdict has sparked three days of large demonstrations which have turned increasingly violent with separatist activists engaged in nighttime clashes with riot police in Barcelona and elsewhere.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No impunity\u2019 \u2013\n\nOvernight, protesters in Barcelona set fire to cars and large wheelie bins, overturned metal barriers and threw firecrackers at police, who pushed back with batons and shields.\n\nEmergency services said 58 people were injured, including a 17-year-old who was hit by a police van.\n\nAnother 38 people were injured in protests in other Catalan cities, including Lerida and Girona.\n\nPolice have arrested 97 people across Catalonia since the protests began, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are experiencing episodes of great violence in Catalonia carried out by minority groups which are perfectly organised,\u201d he said, vowing there would be \u201cno impunity\u201d for those involved in the violence.\n\nBerta Barbet, a political scientist at the University of Barcelona, said the demonstrations \u201cin their current size\u201d would likely only last a week.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about actions that take a lot of time and energy and I don\u2019t see a big part of the population keeping it up for long,\u201d she told AFP.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Push forward\u2019 \u2013\n\nWhile Catalan president Quim Torra has sanctioned and even encouraged civil disobedience, his government is also responsible for the regional police who are charged with controlling demonstrations, putting him in an uncomfortable position.\n\nTorra had not commented on the unrest for days, but overnight he called for an immediate halt to the violent clashes, saying there was \u201cno reason or justification for burning cars\u201d.\n\nBut just hours later, he pledged in Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament to push for a new vote on secession by the end of his term in early 2022.\n\n\u201cWe must push forward and not allow ourselves to be intimidated by threats and bans,\u201d he said.\n\nA poll published in July by a public Catalan institute showed support for an independent Catalonia at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3 percent of people against and 44 percent in favour.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision has thrust the Catalan dispute to the heart of the political debate ahead of Spain\u2019s November 10 general election, its fourth in as many years.\n\nAccording to the first poll since Monday\u2019s verdict, the ruling Socialists are likely to secure the most votes but again fall short of a majority.\n\nThe main opposition conservative Popular Party, which takes a hard line on Catalan separatists, looks set to make significant gains, it found.\n\nPublished in El Mundo daily, it predicted the Socialists will capture 122 seats in the 350-seat parliament, compared with the 123 it took in the last election in April, while the PP would win 98 seats, up from 66.", "description": "Barcelona (AFP) \u2013 Catalan separatists burned barricades and clashed with police in Barcelona on Thursday in a fourth night of violence triggered by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/2a5946_hundreds-young-protesters-chanting-independence-burned-barricades-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
