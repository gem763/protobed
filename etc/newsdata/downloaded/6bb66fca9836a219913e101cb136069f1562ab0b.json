The new gaming console will sport a controller equipped with improved physical feedback technology to convey a variety of sensations, and can also adjust the resistance of triggers to mimic the sensation of drawing a bow or revving an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain.\n\nSony has sold more than 100 million units of the PlayStation 4 as at June and aims to move almost 12 million more by March 2020. It's on track to become the company's best-selling console after the PS2, of which Sony has sold more than 155 million units. But the next iteration of the device may also be the last, as faster Internet speeds are making it possible to play games on remote servers without a local device.\n\nIn the 25 years since the original PlayStation debuted, games have grown in importance for Sony while its once-famed Walkman, Xperia and Bravia brands waned. To ensure the business survives the transition to cloud gaming, Sony has partnered Microsoft Corp. This month, it cut the price of its PlayStation Now video game service in half, to US$9.99 a month, reflecting increasing competition in online offerings. Apple Inc introduced its Arcade service in September at a monthly price of US$4.99 and Google has a US$9.99-a-month Stadia product.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nBLOOMBERG", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Consumer - [TOKYO] Sony Corp's highly anticipated next-generation PlayStation will go on sale in time for the holiday season next year. .
