Several days before the July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump slammed the brakes on a $400 million military-aid package for the country, according to The Washington Post. The president maintains he acted appropriately.\n\nRead more: A mysterious exchange between Trump and a foreign leader is Washington's latest obsession. Here's what's actually going on.\n\nRepublicans hardly broke ranks, and they vigorously defended Trump's conduct. They cast House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's move to jump-start the proceedings as one fueled by hatred of Trump and a desire to rob him of his 2016 election victory.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, one of Trump's staunchest supporters and a ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement that Pelosi's decision to pursue an impeachment inquiry shows only how she has \"finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the socialist wing of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nJim Jordan More\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\n\"This was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people,\" Jordan said.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Rep. Steve Scalise, the Republican whip in the House. \"It's pathetic and disgraceful that after the Mueller report showed there was no collusion, Speaker Pelosi continues to advance this impeachment witch hunt, now relying on unconfirmed, secondhand accusations,\" Scalise said in a statement.\n\nOthers like Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana tried downplaying the significance of the impeachment proceedings. In a colorful and combative interview with NBC's Chuck Todd, Kennedy backed Trump's effort to start an investigation into the Bidens on their dealings in Ukraine.\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1176628211196846080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nWATCH: @chucktodd to @senjohnkennedy on the impeachment inquiry of the president and Hunter Biden's actions in Ukraine: \"I'm not here to allow a false equivalency to take over, sir.\" #MTPDailypic.twitter.com/OTN9ixEe1e\n\nThe GOP's staunch support of Trump reflects a key challenge for Democrats as they proceed with impeachment proceedings in the House: Most Republicans are unlikely to turn against him, given his widespread popularity among GOP voters. Trump held a 91% approval rating among them in the first half of September, according to recent a Gallup poll.\n\nStill, there was a rare unanimous vote in the Senate calling on Trump to release a whistleblower complaint his administration had refused to disclose to Congress, which is said to involve Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian leader. Negotiations are underway between White House and intelligence officials to allow the individual \u2014 who hasn't been identified \u2013 to speak with congressional investigators.\n\nRead more: In rare bipartisan moment, Senate unanimously votes for Trump to release whistleblower complaint to intelligence committees\n\nIn the Senate, only one Republican has mildly rebuked Trump publicly over the Ukraine scandal so far: Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also the party's 2012 presidential nominee. On Sunday, Romney tweeted that \"it would be troubling in the extreme\" if Trump tried pressuring a foreign power into probing his political rival.\n\nNOW WATCH: 'Shark Tank' star Robert Herjavec explains what makes America great", "description": "Republicans doubled down and defended Trump's conduct after Democrats formally launched impeachment proceedings against the president.", "authors": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jVO8Zmwsot1OyoK69oDV8g--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/75758839accf33c08230fa4277ea5cd4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
