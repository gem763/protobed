On campaign trails over the years, Biden has relayed a harrowing account of a soldier\u2019s heroics and humility, as he did recently before a crowd of 400 in Hanover, New Hampshire:\n\nA four-star general had asked the then-vice president to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan, a dangerous foray into \u201cgodforsaken country\u201d to recognize the remarkable heroism of a Navy captain.\n\nSome told him it was too risky, but Biden said he brushed off their concerns. \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d\n\nThe Navy captain, Biden recalled Friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back. Now the general wanted Biden to pin a Silver Star on the American hero who, despite his bravery, felt like a failure.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d Biden said, his jaw clenched and his voice rising to a shout. \u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the God\u2019s truth,\u201d Biden said while telling the story, adding a strange promise: \u201cMy word as a Biden.\u201d According to the Post, Biden\u2019s word as a Biden might not be worth all that much in this scenario, as little of it is immediately true. Based on \u201cinterviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials,\u201d the paper states that he \u201cgot the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nBiden actually visited Kunar in 2008 when he was a senator, not during his tenure as veep. The soldier, Kyle J. White, who retrieved the body was 20 years old, not an established Navy captain. And Biden never pinned a Silver Star on him: It was Obama that did so, and it was the Medal of Honor. (In South Carolina on Thursday, Biden stood by his version of the events.)\n\nWhat\u2019s strange about Biden\u2019s account is that he is telling war stories on the campaign trail in an effort to distance himself from the bravado of Trump\u2019s patriotism and to center actual service members in the conversation. Doing so while getting the details wrong \u2014 or at least a composite blurred enough to no longer be directly factually accurate \u2014 undermines his effort. What\u2019s even stranger is that Biden does have an accurate and compelling story involving the presentation of a medal to a reluctant and emotional soldier who served in Afghanistan. From the Post:\n\nThe version of Biden\u2019s story that\u2019s true \u2014 and just as heart-rending \u2014 is one he rarely tells. The setting was not Kunar province, but Wardak, just southwest of Kabul. The medal recipient was Workman, 35, who had run into a burning vehicle to save his dying friend. By the time Workman had pried open the door and plunged into the flames, it was too late.\n\n\u201cI never pulled him out because he was melting,\u201d Workman recalled in a phone interview earlier this week from Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Wash.\n\nWorkman\u2019s company commander told him that the vice president was going to pin a Bronze Star on him for his heroism. \u201cI tried to get out of going,\u201d recalled Workman, who has since been promoted to first sergeant. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that medal.\u201d Nevertheless on Jan. 11, 2011, a cold, gray day, Workman stood at attention as Biden pinned the medal to his chest. The moment is memorialized in a White House photo and in a 2016 interview that Biden did with National Geographic.\n\nUnlike most days in the Trump era, America\u2019s forever-presence in Afghanistan broke into the news cycle on Thursday in the report on Biden\u2019s storytelling and the announcement of a drawdown in troops in-country from 14,000 to 8,600.", "description": "On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that Joe Biden had told a composite war story on the campaign trail. It\u2019s not within his usual gaffe territory, but his blurred account of a heroic soldier in Afghanistan is still strange.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/08/29/29-joe-biden.w1200.h630.jpg"}
