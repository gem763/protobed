To those who have been paying closer attention, he\u2019s also a self-styled mathematician and philosopher who invented his own math. (Remember how 1x1=2?) Those two aspects of Howard collided last night on the Emmys red carpet when local L.A. correspondents from KTLA asked the actor about his previously announced plans to retire after Empire concludes its run. Fear not, though. Howard is only retiring from the hamster wheel of Hollywood. You will see him again because he\u2019s got a generation to teach about how to fully open the flower of life. Which, again, is what he explained on the red carpet of the 2019 Emmys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent 37 years pretending to be people so that people can pretend to watch and enjoy what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Howard said, kind of shading his own career and audiences when asked if he really was planning to quit acting. Then he added, \u201cI\u2019ve made some discoveries in my own personal life with the science that Pythagoras was searching for. I was able to open up the flower of life properly, and find the real wave conjugations that we\u2019ve been looking for 10,000 years. Why would I continue walking on water for tips when I\u2019ve got an entire generation I can teach a whole new world.\u201d One of the KTLA hosts responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a big remark!\u201d which is really the best possible answer if you\u2019re just trying to keep things moving at an awards preshow broadcast. Howard went on to talk about motion, waves, conjugations, and, obviously, more about the flower of life. You can watch it all right here.\n\nHow are we not talking about the Terrance Howard interview on the red carpet at #Emmys2019 with @KTLA @SamOnTV WHAT ON EARTH DID I JUST WATCH!?!?!? pic.twitter.com/6NBilrkFM0 \u2014 StephenGlickman (@StephenGlickman) September 23, 2019\n\nHoward is receiving a star on the Walk of Fame this week, during which time he says he will \u201cbe able to prove that gravity is only an effect and not a force.\u201d That will be a little different than most Walk of Fame presentations, but props to Howard for spicing up the proceedings. So, give a light round of applause to the KTLA anchors for weathering all that so well, and here\u2019s Howard\u2019s new math, if you\u2019re interested.", "description": "Terrence Howard says he\u2019s going to build Saturn and the Milky Way without gravity, which he says is not a force, during an Emmys red-carpet interview.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-terrence-howard.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
