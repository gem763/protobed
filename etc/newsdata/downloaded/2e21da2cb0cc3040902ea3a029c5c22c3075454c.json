Cancer Research UK is leading the pro-ject, called the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection.\n\nIt involves scientists at three British universities \u2013 Cambridge, Manchester and University College London \u2013 and two in the US, Stanford in California and Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nOther scientists are working on screening for a number of cancers in a single test \u2013 using breathalysers, DNA swabs and blood samples. Screening programmes are available only for breast, cervical and bowel cancer [File photo]\n\nBetter treatments have radically improved cancer survival in recent years.\n\nBut if cancer is detected after it has already spread around the body there is little doctors can do. Late diagnosis is all too common, especially in hard to detect cancers, such as those of the pancreas and ovaries.\n\nScreening programmes, which test the whole population at a certain age, are available only for breast, cervical and bowel cancer.\n\nOther cancers often get diagnosed after symptoms appear, dramatically reducing survival chances.\n\nInitially researchers will aim to improve the current screening programmes, by increasing uptake and making them as targeted and non-invasive as possible.\n\nThey will also develop screening tools for the many cancers where none exist \u2013 such as lung and prostate cancer.\n\nTrials are already under way in Manchester on CT scans for lung cancer, while UCL are about to test MRI scans for prostate cancer.\n\nOther scientists are working on screening for a number of cancers in a single test \u2013 using breathalysers, DNA swabs and blood samples.\n\nDr David Crosby, Cancer Research UK's head of early detection research, said: 'These technologies and the ability to detect cancer early will induce a sea-change in our health systems, shifting it from expensive firefighting of late-stage disease to being able to intervene at its earliest point and deliver rapid, cost-effective treatment.\n\n'We're at a tipping point and have the opportunity to revolutionise how we think about and treat cancer. A future is within our grasp where early detection is the norm.'\n\nInitially researchers will aim to improve the current screening programmes, by increasing uptake and making them as targeted and non-invasive as possible. They will also develop screening tools for the many cancers where none exist [File photo]\n\nEventually the researchers want to develop 'precision prevention', where the disease can be stopped before it even develops.\n\nScientists in Manchester are investigating how to take cells out of a person at high risk of developing cancer and reproduce them to test under which conditions they are most likely to turn cancerous, or which genes increase the risk.\n\nWithin three decades they hope to be able to scan someone's genes early in life and tell them whether they are likely to get cancer \u2013 and how to prevent it.\n\nThe university's Professor Rob Bristow said another benefit of early detection would be reducing worry for the millions not at risk.\n\n'Being able to tell people 'you have no risk for cancer for your entire life', that would be fantastic, right?' he added.\n\n'That's the reciprocal of finding those patients who are very high risk for cancer.'\n\nThe project has five years of funding \u2013 with \u00a340million from Cancer Research UK and \u00a315million from Stanford and Oregon \u2013 and the organisers hope more will flow in.\n\nMichelle Mitchell, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: 'Now is the time to be ambitious. We have the potential to completely change the future of cancer treatment, turning it into a manageable and beatable disease.\n\n'Let us tackle this problem together and beat cancer.'", "description": "A ground-breaking tie-up between leading researchers in Britain and the US aims to detect the disease before it even appears in the body - saving millions of lives.", "authors": ["Ben Spencer Medical Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19969408-0-image-a-73_1571612540963.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
