(Willy Kurniawan/Reuters)\n\nWildfires, many of them intentionally set to clear the way for agricultural operations, have turned the skies over Indonesia\u2019s Jambi province a dark blood red. Images and video shared on social media call attention to the country\u2019s escalating fire problem, with data showing that emissions of greenhouse gases from these blazes are nearly on par with those from Indonesia\u2019s devastating 2015 fire season, which harmed the health of millions via air pollution and vaulted the country to the top 20 list of carbon emitters for the year.\n\nSo far this year, the blazes have scorched an estimated 800,000 acres, which is larger than the state of Rhode Island.\n\nAccording to data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, or CAMS, which is a European Union program, forests and peatlands in Indonesia \u2014 which store a large amount of carbon dioxide \u2014 are going up in flames.\n\n\n\nFires detected by satellite (red dots) and smoke-induced haze across central Sumatra, including Jambi province, on Sept. 21.

It\u2019s not absolutely clear whether this blanket of haze alone caused the red skies or whether other, natural factors contributed, but the fact that many of the pictures were taken around midday Saturday offers a clue.\n\n\n\nPeople wear masks in the thick haze brought on by smog-belching forest fires in Indonesia.

This is earth not planet mars. This is jambi not outer space. This is what we breathe with lungs, not with gills. We humans need air that is clean, not smoke-filled. Location: Kumpeh, Muaro Jambi.\u201d\n\nIni sore bukan malam. Ini bumi bukan planet mars. Ini jambi bukan di luar angkasa. Ini kami yang bernafas dengan paru-paru, bukannya dengan insang. Kami ini manusia butuh udara yang bersih, bukan penuh asap.\n\nLokasi : Kumpeh, Muaro Jambi #KabutAsap #KebakaranHutanMakinMenggila pic.twitter.com/ZwGMVhItwi \u2014 Zuni Shofi Yatun Nisa (@zunishofiyn) September 21, 2019\n\nMost likely, high concentrations of tiny particles contained within the blanket of smoke helped scatter incoming sunlight in such a way that more red light with longer wavelengths was let through than blue light, causing the sky to appear blood-red and orange.\n\nThis afternoon is not night. This is earth not mars planet. This is not in outer space. It's us who breathe with lungs, not with gills. We humans need clean air, not smoke.\n\nLocation: Kumpeh, Muaro Jambi #KabutAsap #KebakaranHutanMakinMenggila pic.twitter.com/WtEqPphgRT \u2014 Kaseehsaulmouk (@kasehsaulmouk) September 22, 2019\n\nSimilar to what has been taking place in the Amazon, Indonesia also struggles with \u201cslash and burn\u201d agriculture, as rainforests are cut down for palm oil plantations, paper mills and other uses. Past haze crises have resulted from such illegal practices, including the one in 2015, and they have caused the government to take more steps to prevent them. However, lax regulations may still be contributing to the problem, as are unusually dry conditions.\n\nOn Friday, CAMS issued a statement saying that the daily estimated equivalent carbon dioxide emissions are \u201creaching a similar level\u201d to those from fires in the same period of 2015.\n\nBetween Aug. 1 and Sept. 22, about 450 megatons of carbon dioxide were released into the air from these fires, compared with about 460 megatons released over the same period in 2015, said Mark Parrington, a CAMS senior scientist, via email.\n\nThe fire activity has been especially severe in Kalimantan, with air quality as poor there as during the 2015 fires, which forced schools to close and affected air quality in nearby Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.\n\n[Haze from Indonesian fires now affecting Philippines]\n\n\u201cApproximately half of the local fire season having passed, it is clear that these fires are unusual and are causing significant concern. In Indonesia, burning peat, which can smolder at low temperatures and underground, is the most significant concern,\u201d because it releases carbon that has been long stored in the ground, Parrington said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSome of this carbon will be taken up again by the biosphere, but this is difficult to estimate in near-real-time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very high and persistent levels of pollution in Indonesia and the Maritime continent that CAMS forecasts and monitors are undoubtedly a threat to human health, flora and fauna.\u201d\n\nSmoke from fires produces a combination of pollution that can affect health for hundreds of miles downwind of the blazes. Tiny particles inside these smoke plumes can enter a person\u2019s lungs and bloodstream, aggravating chronic illness and raising the risks of heart disease, asthma attacks and other ailments. The most vulnerable groups include the very young, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems.", "description": "Out-of-control fires burning across Indonesia have spread a harmful haze across vast areas, turning the sky an eerie red.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "September At Am", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather", "Climate Science For Capital Weather Gang.
