After all, the index does represent some of America\u2019s largest and finest companies. Thanks to their large moats, strong cash flows and big dividends, Dow Jones stocks really are the bluest of the blue-chips and make great portfolio additions.\n\nHowever, the various shades of blue do vary.\n\nThanks to the recent market hiccups, rising global tensions, the trade war and overall economic malaise, not all the Dow Stocks would be considered champions at this point. And in fact, a few of them downright stink. Misreads on trends coupled with the current global economic problems have made several stocks in the blue-chip index chronically underperform in recent weeks and in fact, years for some. That puts them firmly in the \u201cdon\u2019t buy camp.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut how can you tell which Dow Jones stocks are big buys and which are downright sells? Luckily, here at InvestorPlace, we\u2019ve done the leg work for you. Here are three of the Dow\u2019s biggest stocks to avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\nDow Jones Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM)\n\nDow Jones Stocks to Sell: 3M (MMM) More\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nPercent Off 52-Week High: 26%\n\nThe reason to buy industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) stems from the fact the firm is so global in its revenues. A huge portion of its sales come from overseas. That has driven the stock\u2019s cash flows and profits in recent years. The reason to sell 3M is also that it\u2019s so global in its sales.\n\nAs the trade war has dragged on, 3M has been hit hard by the overall slowing global economy. A prime example was its last earnings report. Despite a hefty share buyback program, earnings-per-share for this Dow Jones stock slipped over 37% year-over-year, while net revenues declined 2.6%. The vast bulk of the slippage in sales continues to be from Asia, Europe other emerging markets. These are the regions that drove sales in previous quarters. Moreover, the strong dollar and local currency fluctuations continue to hit 3M hard.\n\nThis is a big deal going forward. With no end to the trade war in sight and major international economies \u2014 such as Germany \u2014 slowing way down/contracting, 3M could be between a rock and hard place. During its last conference call, the industrial stock warned things could get rough. Management is now guiding to earn $8.75 per share on the high-end \u2014 a dip of 3.1% from its last EPS estimate.\n\nWhile 3M isn\u2019t in any danger of cutting its dividend and ending its long streak of payout increases, the continued dip in EPS could spell trouble for its pace of dividend jumps. And with a PEG ratio of nearly 2 and forward P/E of 18, MMM stock isn\u2019t exactly a bargain.\n\nWith many of the catalysts for ownership now deteriorating and the stock relatively expensive, this is one of the Dow Jones stocks to avoid for the time being.\n\n\n\n\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nDow Jones Stocks to Sell: IBM (IBM) More\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPercent Off 52-Week High: 12%\n\nThere are plenty of old school tech stocks that have pivoted correctly in the new paradigm. Dotcom leaders like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have successfully changed their operations to better compete in the cloud and across many new trends in tech. And their investors have been rewarded.\n\nThen there\u2019s IBM (NYSE:IBM).\n\nBig Blue should be a leader. Unfortunately, IBM has managed to make plenty of missteps over the last decade. Missing key trends like the rise of cloud computing has continued to hurt the firm\u2019s bottom line. Revenues last quarter marked the fourth-straight quarterly revenue decline for the tech dinosaur. Based on full-year estimates for 2019, IBM will have seen its sales drop by nearly 19% over the last five years. That\u2019s just terrible.", "description": "I've said it before, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a flawed index due to its price-weighting mechanisms, the index still has plenty of value for investors.
