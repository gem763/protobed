This database is \u2018a catalogue of all objects for which a non-zero impact probability has been detected\u2019.\n\nIt is expected to come within 73,435 miles of Earth, which is why it\u2019s considered so dangerous.\n\nAt that narrow distance, it\u2019s feared a slight gravitational nudge could send it careering into humanity\u2019s homeworld.\n\nA view of the Hera mission\u2019s spacecraft arriving at Didymos (Image: ESA)\n\nNasa and the European Space Agency recently met to discuss a bid to \u2018deflect\u2019 a space rock and \u2018prove the technique as a viable method of planetary defence\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission is called the Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment (AIDA) and will attempt to redirect the smaller part of a double asteroid called Didymos.\n\nIn the first stage of the mission, a spacecraft will smash into the space rock. Then a second ship will assess the crash site and collect data on the effects of the collision.\n\nNasa is already working on a craft called Double Asteroid Impact Test, whilst Italy will send a small CubeSat satellite to monitor the action.\n\nThe ESA mission is called Hera and will perform a \u2018close-up survey of the post-impact asteroid\u2019 and gather measurements such as the asteroid\u2019s mass as well as the size of the crater left behind after impact.\n\nIllustration showing the DART craft smashing into Didymos, viewed from the larger object in the binary asteroid (Image: ESA)\n\n\u2018DART can perform its mission without Hera \u2013 the effect of its impact on the asteroid\u2019s orbit will be measurable using Earth ground-based observatories alone,\u2019 said Ian Carnelli, who is managing the Hera mission.\n\n\u2018But flying the two missions together will greatly magnify their overall knowledge return. Hera will in fact gather essential data to turn this one-off experiment into an asteroid deflection technique applicable to other asteroids. Hera will also be the first mission to rendezvous with a binary asteroid system, a mysterious class of object believed to make up around 15% of all known asteroids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And our mission will test a variety of important new technologies, including deep space CubeSats, inter-satellite links and autonomous image-based navigation techniques, while also providing us with valuable experience of low-gravity operations.\u2019\n\nThe main body of Didymos is roughly 780 metres wide across, with its \u2018moonlet\u2019 about the size of Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid, stretching to about 160 metres wide.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists warned that asteroids are stronger than predicted and said humanity could have a tough time destroying a doomsday space rock on a collision course with Earth.\n\nThey found that a huge impact would not turn a city-sized object into a harmless \u2018rubble pile\u2019, but leave it with \u2018significant strength\u2019.\n\nThe findings could have a massive influence on how our species deals with the threat posed by gigantic space rocks.\n\n\u2018We are impacted fairly often by small asteroids, such as in the Chelyabinsk event a few years ago,\u2019 said K.T. Ramesh of Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u2018It is only a matter of time before these questions go from being academic to defining our response to a major threat.\n\n\u2018We need to have a good idea of what we should do when that time comes \u2013 and scientific efforts like this one are critical to help us make those decisions.\u2019\n\nScientists are currently trying to work out what to do if an asteroid suddenly appears on the horizon.\n\nThe latest research considered what would happen if we smashed a kilometre-wide asteroid into another that\u2019s 25-kilometres wide \u2013 which is easily big enough to wipe out life on Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey found that \u2018millions of cracks formed and rippled throughout the asteroid, parts of the [larger] asteroid flowed like sand, and a crater was created\u2019 after the impact.\n\nBut after this, \u2018the impacted asteroid retained significant strength because it had not cracked completely, indicating that more energy would be needed to destroy asteroids\u2019.\n\nThis means we might find it very hard to just go up into space and nuke an asteroid, forcing us to adopt a different strategy to save our species from apocalypse space rocks.\n\n\u201cIt may sound like science fiction but a great deal of research considers asteroid collisions,\u2019 said Charles El Mir, lead author of a paper on the research.\n\n\u2018For example, if there\u2019s an asteroid coming at the Earth, are we better off breaking it into small pieces, or nudging it to go a different direction?\n\n\u2018And if the latter, how much force should we hit it with to move it away without causing it to break? These are actual questions under consideration.\u2019", "description": "Space rock called 2019 SU3 will cause serious damage if it ploughs into our planet.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89425477_1570798772.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
