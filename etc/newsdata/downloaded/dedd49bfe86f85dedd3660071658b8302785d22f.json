Orion Sang, Detroit Free Press\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2014 Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh appeared to be displeased with some calls that went against his team in a 28-21 loss at No. 7 Penn State on Saturday night.\n\nAfter the game, Harbaugh was asked a question about the offense's final play, a failed fourth-and-goal attempt from Penn State's 3 that could've tied the game at 28 with just over two minutes left in the fourth.\n\nHarbaugh began the answer by describing how the Wolverines called the pass play.\n\nThen he moved onto a different subject: The officiating.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to compare some of the different scenarios in the game, in terms of calls,\" Harbaugh said. \"Lavert's holding penalty that led to a touchdown on 3rd and 11 versus a couple of those there at the end. Some of our receivers were getting tackled there, last couple plays of that drive.\"\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh argues a call during the first half against Penn State in State College, Pa., Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019.

The penalty occurred during a third-and-11 play which ended in a Penn State incompletion over the head of the intended receiver, tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nHad the play stood, the Nittany Lions would've had to punt with a seven-point lead.\n\nBut the flag was thrown on Hill, giving Penn State a fresh set of downs \u2014 and four plays later, quarterback Sean Clifford hit receiver KJ Hamler for a 53-yard touchdown pass.\n\nHarbaugh also touched upon other calls.\n\n\"Be interesting to see the lineman downfield, the one they called on us that took off a touchdown compared to \u2014 especially the one that stands out in my mind was the Hawkins one, going for an interception and the guard knocking it away,\" he said. \"So there's a few. The (offensive pass interference) they called on us versus the (offensive pass interference) that I thought should've been called on them on their first touchdown.\n\n\"As far as the calls and the officiating goes, that'll be interesting to compare some of those.\"\n\nMichigan was flagged eight times for 48 yards. Offensive pass interference was notably called twice \u2014 once on Nico Collins on a deep ball that was offset by defensive holding, and one later on Donovan Peoples-Jones. Harbaugh, meanwhile, believed Freiermuth should've been whistled for offensive pass interference on his first-quarter touchdown catch, during which it appeared he pushed off of linebacker Khaleke Hudson.\n\n\"Very frustrating because we just worked so hard,\" said defensive end Kwity Paye when asked about the penalties. \"Someone makes a huge play, we look back to the flag on the ground, and it\u2019s heartbreaking to give them another opportunity to put the ball into the end-zone.\u201d", "description": "Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh questioned some calls that went against the Wolverines in a 28-21 loss at No. 7 Penn State.", "authors": ["Orion Sang", "Published A.M.
