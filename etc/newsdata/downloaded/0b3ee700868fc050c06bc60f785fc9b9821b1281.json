(Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence that vaping, as a general matter, is harmful. And compared to smoking, it\u2019s downright healthy.\n\nNever before has a boon to public health been met with such hysteria and ingratitude.\n\nVaping is almost all upside in comparison with traditional smoking, a wanton destroyer of health and lives, and yet the nation is in the grip of a panic about e-cigarettes.\n\nIn a rarity for the Trump era, the anti-vaping sentiment jumps traditional geographic and political bounds, running from the Oval Office to San Francisco, from President Donald Trump to his most fervent enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump announced a Food and Drug Administration ban on flavored e-cigarettes last week, while not too long ago the San Francisco Board of Supervisors banned the sale of vaping products at retail outlets and \u2014 seemingly more persnickety about this than, say, the use of heroin or public defecation \u2014 prohibited their delivery to addresses in the city.\n\nNew York governor Andrew Cuomo just imposed a ban on flavored e-cigarettes on an \u201cemergency\u201d basis. \u201cVaping is dangerous, period,\u201d Cuomo pronounced, citing, like the president, teenage use in particular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, there\u2019s little evidence that vaping, as a general matter, is hazardous, and compared with traditional cigarettes it\u2019s a refreshing kale and spinach smoothie after a brisk workout at your favorite Pilates studio.\n\nTraditional smokers inhale a witch\u2019s brew of carcinogens and carbon monoxide. Smoking accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths, and 18 percent of all deaths. The founder of National Review, William F. Buckley, a longtime cigar smoker who suffered from emphysema at the end of his life and had seen too many family members and colleagues killed by smoking-related illnesses, said in one of his last columns that he\u2019d ban cigarettes if he could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA credible estimate is that e-cigarettes, which involve inhaling a nicotine-infused vapor rather than smoke, are about 95 percent less harmful than cigarettes.\n\nThe vaping-related illnesses that have recently garnered headlines and prompted the regulatory actions appear not to implicate standard vaping, but rather the use of black-market liquids containing THC, the active ingredient in cannabis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn announcing his flavored-vaping ban, Cuomo said that \u201cmany of these other products have no control on them whatsoever,\u201d which is by definition true because they are black-market products. We could make the risky products involved illegal, if they weren\u2019t already illegal.\n\nThe problem with the flavor bans \u2014 and especially a San Francisco\u2013style outright ban \u2014 is their effect on adult e-cigarette users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 11 million adults vape, and some percentage of them are former smokers or would be smoking in the absence of e-cigarettes. A robust study in the United Kingdom found that vaping is twice as effective as other common nicotine replacements in getting smokers to quit. The flavors, according to surveys of users, are a big draw for smokers quitting traditional cigarettes.\n\nIt\u2019s manifestly absurd to ban vaping products and leave cigarettes, including flavored cigarettes, on the market.\n\nAnother source of the current panic is that teen vaping is way up. In 2017, 11.7 percent of teens reported having vaped over the past 30 days; in 2019, 27.5 percent did. There\u2019s nothing to suggest that this increase in vaping is encouraging real teen smoking, which continues to decline and has fallen to less than 6 percent.\n\nEveryone would prefer that teens not develop a vaping habit, but this presents nothing close to the health issue presented by combustible cigarettes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy all means, let\u2019s crack down on retailers who are violating the prohibition against selling products to minors. But exaggerating the harms of vaping and prohibiting the products is a formula for giving back some of the gains against traditional smoking.\n\nThe libertarian publication Reason points to one study that, insanely, shows more people beginning to consider e-cigarettes as dangerous as regular cigarettes.\n\nThe U.K. has adopted a much more sensible approach that welcomes e-cigarettes as an important harm-reduction measure. A couple of National Health Service hospitals have even allowed vape shops to open on their premises.\n\nThat would cause a hue and cry in the United States, where we can\u2019t agree on anything except, apparently, our irrational hostility to a product that is an alternative to a terrible scourge.\n\n\u00a9 2019 King Features Syndicate", "description": "There\u2019s little evidence that vaping, as a general matter, is harmful.
