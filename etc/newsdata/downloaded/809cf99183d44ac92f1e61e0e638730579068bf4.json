His daughter was later allowed to board a flight home to Utah accompanied by a family friend, and the family is said to be \u201cdoing well under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s English-teaching industry has seen substantial growth over the past two decades, with thousands of Americans going out to teach for relatively high salaries. However, many face problems securing visas and navigating the strict control of life under the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSpeaking to the South China Morning Post on the condition of anonymity, a U.S. State Department official confirmed that they were monitoring the situation and the detainees were receiving \u201call appropriate consular services.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the detention of two US citizens in Jiangsu, China and the charges being brought against them by the provincial government,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to assist US citizens abroad and are monitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "A teaching company announced that China arrested two of its members running an English language school on \"bogus charges.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/jail-prisoner-handcuffs.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
