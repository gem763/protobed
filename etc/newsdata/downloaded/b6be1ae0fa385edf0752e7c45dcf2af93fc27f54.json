He vows to fight against the \u201cthick line dividing the party aristocracy and the Bulgarian people.\u201d\n\nCalled \u201cThere\u2019s No Such State,\u201d his movement has enough support to enter parliament as the fourth-largest party, according to a survey by the Alpha Research pollster last month. But he\u2019ll have to wait -- the next elections are planned in early 2021.\n\nPrime Minister Boyko Borissov is serving his third term since 2009 and is pushing for the Balkan nation that joined the EU 12 years ago to adopt the euro. But not enough has been done to fight corruption and implement reforms, prompting workers to leave and making the population one of the world\u2019s fastest shrinking.\n\n\u201cThe people that rule and that are elected by a significant part of the Bulgarian voters are grasping for power,\u201d Trifonov told his supporters, according to an emailed statement. \u201cI\u2019m not grasping for power, I\u2019m grasping for justice.\u201d\n\nTrifonov\u2019s policies include reintroducing compulsory voting in the country of 7 million people and reducing the number of lawmakers. He\u2019s also been calling for a more intensive overhaul of the judiciary and the health-care system.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Slav Okov in Sofia at sokov@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Irina Vilcu at isavu@bloomberg.net, Andrea Dudik, James Amott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hot on the heels of Ukraine\u2019s comic-turned-president, another showman wants to take on the political establishment -- this time in nearby Bulgaria, the European Union\u2019s poorest member-state.Stanislav Trifonov, whose satirical TV shows are the eastern European country\u2019s most popular, held", "authors": ["Slav Okov"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
