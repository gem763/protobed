They said they would delay the decision until the political debate had \"played out\".\n\nNo 10 has insisted Mr Johnson will comply with the law, but Laura Kuenssberg says there are still conversations going on in Downing Street about writing a second letter, making the case that a delay is unnecessary.\n\nThe House of Commons has only sat on four Saturdays since 1939, including on 2 September that year, due to the outbreak of World War Two.\n\nThe last time there was a Saturday sitting was 3 April 1982, due to the invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nTalks are ongoing between the UK and EU after Mr Johnson submitted new proposals for a Brexit deal, centred on replacing the Irish backstop - the policy negotiated between Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland.\n\nThe UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, will meet European Commission officials later - but sources on both sides told BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming that technical talks had effectively reached the limit of what they could achieve.\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier will have a lunch meeting on Thursday to discuss the state of play.\n\nFrench President Emanuel Macron has told Mr Johnson the EU will make its final position clear on the chances of a deal by the end of this week.\n\n'Blame game' row\n\nAs the clock ticks down towards the summit, the political tension has been rising.\n\nA row broke out on Tuesday after a No 10 source said a call between Mr Johnson and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had made a deal \"essentially impossible\", claiming she made clear a deal based on his proposals was \"overwhelmingly unlikely\".\n\nMrs Merkel's office said it would not comment on \"private\" conversations.\n\nBut the President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, accusing him of playing a \"stupid blame game\" - a criticism echoed by a number of opposition parties in the UK.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar spoke to Mr Johnson on the phone for 45 minutes, and told broadcaster RTE afterwards it would be \"very difficult\" to reach an agreement before the end of the month.\n\nHowever, the two leaders are expected to meet for further talks later this week.\n\nThis special sitting will be a huge day.\n\nThat is because it will be the moment when Boris Johnson either returns to chants of \"hail the conquering hero\" - if he manages to get this elusive Brexit deal - or, more likely, returns with no-deal and has to set out his next steps.\n\nAnd we are hearing that No 10 may seek to seize the initiative by putting down a series of motions for MPs to vote on - in other words asking them do they want to leave with no deal, do they want to revoke Article 50, etc.\n\nBut at the same time that Boris Johnson wants to use that moment to try and grasp the initiative, it is clear the rebel alliance of opposition MPs also wants to seize the day.\n\nThey want to ensure Boris Johnson sits down, gets out the Basildon Bond and writes that letter to the European Commission asking for a further delay.\n\nSo both sides are now poised to try and gain control of that Saturday to map out the next steps, assuming - and I think it is a fairly widespread assumption in Westminster now - that there is not going to be a deal.", "description": "Parliament will meet on Saturday 19 October after a key EU summit to approve the next steps for the UK.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B99C/production/_109161574_5d55a84e-ffea-4081-b04d-3f2a62799da9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
