Sign up here.\n\nThe Trump administration placed eight Chinese technology giants on a U.S. blacklist on Monday, accusing them of being implicated in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the country\u2019s far-western region of Xinjiang.\n\nThe companies include two video surveillance companies -- Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. -- that by some accounts control as much as a third of the global market for video surveillance and have cameras all over the world. Also targeted were SenseTime Group Ltd. -- the world\u2019s most valuable artificial intelligence startup -- and fellow AI giant Megvii Technology Ltd., which is said to be aiming to raise up to $1 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering. Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the pair are at the forefront of China\u2019s ambition to dominate AI in coming years.\n\nThe move, which was announced after U.S. markets closed, came on the same day negotiators from the U.S. and China began working-level preparations for high-level talks due to begin Thursday in Washington. Entities on the list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without being granted a U.S. government license, though some have maintained relationships with banned companies through international subsidiaries. Hikvision and Dahua were suspended from trading Tuesday but iFlytek Co., one of the eight singled out, slid as much as 3.1% in Shenzhen.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\u201d in Xinjiang, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a federal register notice published Monday.\n\nThe move, first reported by Reuters, takes President Donald Trump\u2019s economic war against China in a new direction, marking the first time his administration has cited human rights as a reason for action. Past moves to blacklist companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. have been taken on national security grounds. The president\u2019s tariff war against Beijing, meanwhile, has been fought over issues such as intellectual property theft and control of technology as well as China\u2019s broader industrial policy.\n\nSenseTime, Dahua and Megvii weren\u2019t immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce didn\u2019t immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.\n\n\u201cHikvision strongly opposes today\u2019s decision by the U.S. government and it will hamper efforts by global companies to improve human rights around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cPunishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision\u2019s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nIt also comes as Trump faces growing pressure at home to support pro-democracy protests in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong. On Monday, Trump said he was hoping for a \u201chumane solution\u201d in a city where protests have grown increasingly violent.\n\n\u201cThey even have signs, \u2018Make China Great Again,\u2019 \u2018Make Hong Kong Great Again,\u2019\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey have tremendous signage.\u201d\n\nNone of the other companies had immediate comment. Some of the firms added to the list trade on Chinese exchanges, which weren\u2019t open yet when the announcement was made in the U.S.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say:\n\n\u201cWith growth fading, the U.S. and China could both use at least a reprieve from trade tensions. A mini-deal was mooted. It now looks less likely.\u201d\n\n--Bloomberg Economics Chief Economist Tom Orlik\n\nRead the full analysis here\n\nThe news broke just as Trump was attending the signing of a partial trade agreement with Japan and predicting a big week of talks with China.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a chance that we could do something very substantial,\u201d he told reporters of the China talks. \u201cI think they\u2019re coming to make a deal, we\u2019ll see whether or not a deal can be made.\u201d\n\nA Commerce Department spokesman said \u201ctoday\u2019s action is unrelated to the trade negotiations.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The Trump administration placed eight Chinese technology giants on a U.S. blacklist on Monday, accusing them of being implicated in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the", "authors": ["Shawn Donnan", "Jenny Leonard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/37PvRe90nyu4CyY7kyYaZA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/3dd7db7b3dc49218b4b6f5a10c5191c4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
