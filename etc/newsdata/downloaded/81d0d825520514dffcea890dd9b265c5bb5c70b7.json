Only 3% wanted full integration with Australia, which some autonomy activists fear is the direction the government is taking it in.\n\nRelated content 10 best places for outdoor fun in New Zealand\n\nThe survey garnered 457 votes (about one-quarter of the island's population), according to Candice Nobbs. She is a member of the management committee of the group Norfolk Island People for Democracy, which organized the survey.\n\nThe group launched the poll on their website to show that there were a lot of people who were unhappy with how the island was currently governed, Nobbs said.\n\nNorfolk's governance has been the subject of controversy for years. Since the then-uninhabited island was discovered by British explorer Captain James Cook in 1774, it has variously been a British penal colony, a British colony and an Australian territory.\n\nConvict buildings from the 1820's at Kingston, Norfolk Island. Shutterstock\n\nWith the island facing economic problems and a tourism downturn, Australia reformed how Norfolk Island was governed, making mainland taxes, social security and other programs apply on the island.\n\nBut while some people welcomed the additional services, others felt that they were losing their independence.\n\nNobbs said the problem with Australia's approach was that it amounted to \"taking us over\" as they had shown a \"lack of respect\" towards the culture of Norfolk Island -- including the island's different approach to land rights.\n\nRelated content New Zealand asks travelers to help protect the environment\n\nNorfolk is around 500 miles from the northern tip of New Zealand, compared to almost 900 miles (1,440 km) from the Australian east coast, and Nobbs said Wellington had a history of working well with other South Pacific island nations.\n\nShe pointed to Niue, which is a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand.\n\nWhile Nobbs thought that independence was unrealistic for Norfolk Island, she could see why people voted for that. Many people thought \"you know what, let's try and fend for ourselves,\" she said.", "description": "Norfolk Island is a tiny landmass of about 1,800 people in the South Pacific, about 500 miles (800 km) from the nearest country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191029215832-03-norfolk-island-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
