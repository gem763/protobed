This week, a New York Times report revealed that the officer and staff member first discussed the allegations against the president before the inspector general received the complaint.\n\nColleague Catherine Herridge rpts ICIG Atkinson told lawmakers the whistleblower did not disclose to the ICI that he contacted Schiff's committee. Atkinson said the whistleblower volunteered he was a registered Democrat \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) October 4, 2019\n\nPer Catherine Herridge: IC Inspector General told lawmakers the whistleblower did not disclose contact w Schiff/Committee staff \u2013 so IG never looked into it. IG \u201chad no knowledge of it\u201d. \u2014 Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) October 4, 2019\n\nThe Times reported that the staffer shared several of the officer\u2019s claims with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA). The California Democrat is under fire for erroneously claiming in a recent interview that \u201cwe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to,\u201d Schiff told MSNBC contributor Sam Stein when asked if the two had ever spoken. \u201cBut I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\u201d\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, a spokesperson for the House Intelligence panel acknowledged Schiff\u2019s response to Stein\u2019s question \u201cshould have been more carefully phrased.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegarding Chairman Schiff\u2019s comments on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 in the context, he intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cAs he said in his answer, the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the acting [director of national intelligence] as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump reacted Friday to Herridge\u2019s report, tweeting: \u201cWOW, this is big stuff!\u201d\n\nWOW, this is big stuff! https://t.co/H12yxMfua3 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nThe report raises further questions about both the CIA officer and his complaint. As Breitbart News reported, the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d failed to follow the law for protecting intelligence community members seeking to report wrongdoing by contacting the House Intelligence Committee before the Intelligence Community inspector general:\n\nIntelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998 explicitly requires an official concerned about wrongdoing within the government to go to the IC inspector general before the congressional panels in charge of oversight of the intelligence community. [\u2026] The employee may contact the congressional intelligence committees directly as described in clause (i) only if the employee \u2013 a. before making such a contact, furnishes to the DNI, through the IC IG, a statement of the employee\u2019s complaint or information and notice of the employee\u2019s intent to contact the congressional intelligence committees directly; and\n\nb. obtains and follows from the DNI, through the IC IG, direction on how to contact the congressional intelligence committees in accordance with necessary and appropriate security procedures.\n\nAnd yet, the officer\u2019s failure to follow whistleblower laws isn\u2019t the only red flag. The Inspector General found that the officer\u2019s complaint was not only based on second-hand information, but that the officer also possessed a \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of a \u201cpolitical rival\u201d of President Trump. CNN reported on Thursday that the officer is a registered Democrat.", "description": "The so-called Ukraine \"whistleblower\" reportedly did not disclose contacts with a House staffer to the intel community inspector general.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178815792-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
