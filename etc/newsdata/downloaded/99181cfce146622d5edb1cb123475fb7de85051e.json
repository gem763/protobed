REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nRelease of September flash business surveys from around the world later in the day could set the tone for the rest of the week, with the absence of Japanese markets earlier draining activity overnight.\n\nReports on Friday that Chinese trade negotiators cancelled a good-will visit to U.S. farms threw cold water on the preparatory talks late last week.\n\nWall Street stocks ended in the red, with traders seeing little progress before top-level talks next month despite last week\u2019s U.S. postponement of another series of planned tariffs.\n\nShanghai fell 1.4% earlier and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down about 0.8% after another weekend of sometimes violent street protests.\n\nTokyo was closed and Seoul\u2019s Kospi ended flat. U.S. stock futures were up, European equivalents down.\n\nThe dollar and U.S. Treasury yields were mostly steady after last week\u2019s quarter-point U.S. interest rate cut left markets underwhelmed about the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to further monetary easing.\n\nTemporary ructions in the U.S. repo and money markets have dissipated after a series of Fed market operations, but traders are uneasy about how the Fed\u2019s market monitors allowed the situation to develop in the first place and fretting about whether it would be nimble enough to deal with more serious liquidity problems in future.\n\nElsewhere, oil prices were up as investors continued to watch military developments in the Middle East and Saudi retaliation for last week\u2019s attacks on its oil facilities.\n\nSterling was weaker before this week\u2019s UK Supreme Court decision on the legality of the recent suspension of parliament and the opposition Labour Party\u2019s wrangling over Brexit.\n\nUK PM Boris Johnson will meet with European Union leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week but said a breakthrough on the Brexit impasse was unlikely to happen there.\n\nThe Thomas Cook collapse also hit sentiment as the UK Civil Aviation Authority sets about getting roughly 150,000 stranded tourists home in the biggest peacetime repatriations of UK citizens.\n\nThomas Cook shares were suspended; shares in rival European tour operators such as TUI are expected to rise about 4%.\n\nThe travel sector at large was in play.\n\nAirlines, which could be supported as Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse is expected to remove over-capacity.\n\nOther stocks linked to tourism such as Amadeus, Melia and NH HOTEL may gain.\n\nElmos Semiconductor is seen rising as much as 5% after it agreed to sell Silicon Micro.\n\nGerman real estate company Vonovia might be hit after it agreed to buy Swedish Hembla from Blackstone.\n\nPrivate equity firm Advent is in talks to join Bain in its takeover bid for Germany\u2019s Osram, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThat move could further fuel the bidding war with AMS for the lighting group.\n\nA profit warning from DEUTZ is seen sending shares in the engine maker down 5%.\n\nTraders were also watching Marks & Spencer, whose chief financial officer stepped down after little more than a year. The shares are seen opening lower.\n\nIn the battered banking sector, Spanish banks could benefit after S&P\u2019s upgraded the country\u2019s credit rating.\n\nA look at the day ahead from EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
