She picked up fresh pasta, chicken and six eggs at the event on Thursday morning.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail - MEN Media)\n\nShe said: \"My cupboards are nice and full for another week. For what you get it's more than worth it, especially when you've got a family.\"\n\nAnd she said the coffee mornings provide regular opportunities to catch up with teachers and other parents.\n\n\"There's a lot of mums here who wouldn't talk to one another normally that now talk and everyone feels part of something,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone gets on with everyone, from every walk of life, and you make an effort with people. It really has made a great difference to the school.\"\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail - MEN Media)\n\nSusan Gray, who said her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all went to Chiltern, said she often gives food that she picks up but does not need to her elderly neighbour.\n\n\"It's like a home from home,\" she said. \"It's brilliant, especially for someone with a few kids. Just a quid for a few things and you can't go wrong.\"\n\nSchool governors and other teachers regularly drop in on the events. They are also attended by the school nurse, who is on hand to give any advice or answer questions from parents.\n\nThey also have weekly visits by PCSOs or members of the local authority, which assistant head Claire Lundie said gives the parents a voice in the community.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail - MEN Media)\n\nShe said the events had grown in popularity so much that they had to double their food order from FareShare and were now receiving the maximum amount.\n\n\"People would come and we'd sell out within 10 minutes,\" she said. \"It's really evolved and it's definitely been a learning curve.\"\n\nShe said they provide shopping baskets to make sure the process is fair and easy, while any food left over is distributed to families with additional needs.\n\nBut she said one of the main benefits of Chat and Choose was for parents to relay their concerns in a more informal setting than having to make an appointment with the school.\n\n(Image: Peter Harbour)\n\n\"That's why we call it 'Chat and Choose',\" she said.\n\n\"We sometimes get parents come in who might be struggling with their child's behaviour and they can just talk with us about it and we can get that early intervention.\n\n\"It's a way of breaking down barriers, we're not here to be judgmental.\"\n\nLisa Greig, family links coordinator, runs the events alongside Mrs Lundie. She said: \"It's a safe space where they can come every Thursday morning and have a cup of tea.\n\n\"There's lots of families from other countries and cultures, it's a real community. And it's something people look forward to, they think, 'Oh I better get in early Thursday morning for Chat and Choose'.\n\n\"We get other schools come in looking at setting it up in their area.\n\n\"It's definitely something I'm proud of.\"\n\nThe Chat and Choose events take place for parents at the school every Thursday from 8.45am to 10am.", "description": "Chiltern Primary School lets mums and dads can choose six different items of fresh, dried or chilled food that would have otherwise gone to waste", "authors": ["Nathan Standley", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail - Men Media", "Peter Harbour"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HUL_Chat-and-Choose-02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
