I\u2019ve tried out a raft of noise-canceling cans. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve event been on flights with ANC headphones. But, for some cursed reason, I never actually turned on noise-canceling features during a flight.\n\nUntil last week. And lord, my life has been altered forever.\n\nNow, just as a refresher, active noise-canceling headphones work as the name suggests: they cancel noise, actively.\n\nGenerally, they work by having a series of microphones on the headphones that analyze and neutralize the ambient sound. They basically invert the sound waves that are entering your ears, meaning the noise is literally\u2026 canceled.\n\nI\u2019ve had a pretty mixed response to noise-canceling headphones in the past \u2014 probably because of my completely unrealistic expectations. When I first heard about the technology, I assumed it\u2019d be like that bit in the Ben Affleck Daredevil movie (yes, I made that reference) where he sleeps in a water coffin thing in order to escape the cacophony of the world. I could picture it: I\u2019d slip my ANC headphones on, and would be safe in a world free from banal conversations about people\u2019s kids.\n\nI was mistaken.\n\nTHE MISTAKE\n\nInstead of pure, unbridled silence, ANC headphones tend to muffle and dampen my environment. Yes, everything\u2019s quieter, but you can still catch what people are saying. Which is a shitter.\n\nWithout getting too bogged down in details, this happens because of frequencies. ANC headphone technology functions up to sounds with frequencies of 1,000Hz, but works best on those under 500Hz.\n\nAnd, irritatingly, the human voice\u2019s intelligibility range goes from about 500Hz to 4,000Hz \u2014 explaining why those tinny voices seem to echo around your expensive ANC headphones.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker though: most engine noise and vehicle sound occurs under 500Hz, something ANC headphones are adept at eliminating. A fact that explains what can only be called my blessed airplane ANC revelation.\n\nTHE BLESSED AIRPLANE ANC REVELATION\n\nIt happened unexpectedly. I was using the Master and Dynamic MW65 headphones on a journey to London. I wasn\u2019t even aware that I had the noise-canceling function on as I boarded the plane and it took off.\n\nThen, at some point on that flight, I realized something: I couldn\u2019t hear the actual plane itself. And I could hear my music really well. And my phone wasn\u2019t at top volume. Some magical fuckery was going down, I was sure of it. And, friends, it was.\n\nI fiddled with the Master and Dynamic MW65 headphones, and turned off the noise-canceling function. The sound of the plane roared into a space where it previously wasn\u2019t. I turned ANC back on and the clamor stopped. On. Off. On. Off. I felt like a noise-canceling god. And that felt great.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that my music was so much clearer; everything felt better. I found the journey more relaxing, it was though I was in a glorious audio cocoon. Honestly, it fucking rocked.\n\nSo, let me say this: if you do any amount of flying, do yourself a favor and pick up a pair of noise-canceling headphones. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nDON\u2019T KNOW WHAT ANC HEADPHONES TO CHOOSE?\n\nWell, luckily there are a whole load of us at TNW who can recommend you a great pair.\n\n\u201cThese are the headphones I had my transcendental experience with. They\u2019re expensive, but I\u2019m already in love with the damn things.\u201d \u2014 Callum\n\nCheck \u2019em out here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty happy with my pair of Sony WH-CH700N headphones. They\u2019re relatively cheap and good quality. I find a lot of ANC headphones uncomfortable and a bit headache-inducing, but the ANC on my Sony pair is just right. They were a real life-saver on my trip to Seoul!\u201d \u2014 M\u00e1r\n\nPurchase the sexy things here.\n\n\u201cThese are the headphones you do a listening test with, and they then customize the sound they produce to your hearing. They\u2019re amazing. And have active noise-canceling. If you want something different, these are for you.\u201d \u2014 Callum\n\nGet involved by clicking here.\n\n\u201cI like to pack light when I travel, and that means I generally restrict myself to a single pair of headphones. That\u2019s when I reach for my trusty TaoTronics SoundSurge 46. They\u2019re not up there in terms of audio fidelity like some of my other cans, but they\u2019re comfortable enough to wear for hours, charge quickly, and offer pretty solid ANC that makes long flights bearable. They\u2019re also fairly inexpensive and come with a durable case, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much about wear and tear on the road.\u201d \u2014 Abhi\n\nRead our full review here and pop in this direction to simply buy the cans.\n\n\u201cThe Jabra 85h are perhaps the most well-rounded pair of ANC cans I\u2019ve ever used. The battery life is perhaps the most enduring of any headphones I\u2019ve tested, while the noise cancelling is surprisingly effective. They\u2019re comfortable and well-built, and sound amazing.\u201d \u2014 Matt\n\nTreat yo\u2019self.\n\nThere you go: not only did you get a life-changing recommendation about ANC headphones on flights, you also received selection of the best noise-canceling cans about.
