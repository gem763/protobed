A melting Olaf?\n\nFor years, a group of Frozen fans has been pushing Disney to #GiveElsaAGirlfriend.\n\nNow that the trailer is out for the sequel to the hugely popular 2013 movie, some people want to know: Is Elsa getting a girlfriend in Frozen II?\n\nHate to disappoint, but it doesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\n\u201cShe is not defined by a romantic relationship,\u201d said Frozen II producer Peter Del Vecho when CBC Kids News contributor Spencer Barbosa asked him to dish on Elsa\u2019s love life in the upcoming movie.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not where she\u2019s at in her life.\u201d\n\nOf course, we\u2019ll have to wait until the official release date \u2014 Nov. 22 \u2014 to know for sure.\n\nBut given how passionate some people have been about the topic on social media, the final confirmation is sure to ruffle some feathers.\n\nSo, if the movie isn\u2019t about Elsa\u2019s love interest, what is it about?\n\nDel Vecho, who also produced the first Frozen movie and won an Oscar for it, said it\u2019s all about understanding the source of Elsa\u2019s magic powers \u2014 and their purpose.\n\n\u201cWhere did they come from? What am I meant to do with them?\u201d Elsa asks herself this time around.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the journey that she\u2019s on,\u201d Del Vecho said.\n\nAlthough Frozen II doesn\u2019t open in theatres until Nov. 22, Disney posted the official YouTube trailer on Sept. 23. (Disney)\n\nOf course, part of what made the first Frozen movie such a huge success was the karaoke-worthy hit song Let it go.\n\nAlthough Del Vecho talked about seven songs that \u201cfit perfectly\u201d into the upcoming movie, he didn\u2019t single out one song as a possible billboard chart topper.\n\nDisney may need to just let that dream go this time around.\n\nLet it go, Disney. Just let it go.\n\nOscar award-winning Disney producer Peter Del Vecho says Frozen II is about understanding where Elsa\u2019s magic powers come from and what she\u2019s supposed to do with them. (Ricky Middlesworth/Disney)\n\nDel Vecho hinted at one more detail that Frozen fans have been wondering about: Could Olaf the snowman melt in this next instalment of the franchise?\n\n\u201cOnly if he feels that some people are worth melting for,\u201d he said.\n\nYikes. Look out, Olaf!\n\nAlthough Del Vecho didn\u2019t confirm either way, it sounds like you might want to have some ice packs handy, just in case.\n\nWill Olaf melt in Frozen II? 'Only if he feels that some people are worth melting for,' says Disney producer Peter Del Vecho. (Disney)", "description": "Does Elsa get a girlfriend in Frozen II?
