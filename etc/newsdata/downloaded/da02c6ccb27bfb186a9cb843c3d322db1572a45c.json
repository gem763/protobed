Also charged in the superseding indictment are: Ruben Sevumyants, 36, of Marlboro, New Jersey; and Samuel \u201cSam\u201d Khaimov, 47, and Yana Shtindler, 44, both of Glen Head, New York. Sevumyants was previously charged by indictment, and Khaimov and Shtindler were each previously charged by complaint.\n\nAccording to documents filed in this case:\n\nPrime Aid Pharmacies \u2013 now closed \u2013 operated as \u201cspecialty pharmacies\u201d out of locations in Union City, New Jersey, and Bronx, New York. They processed expensive medications used to treat various conditions, including Hepatitis C, Crohn\u2019s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Fleyshmakher worked at Prime Aid Union City and was an owner of Prime Aid Bronx. Khaimov was an owner of Prime Aid Union City and the lead pharmacist of Prime Aid Bronx. Shtindler was Prime Aid Union City\u2019s administrator, and Sevumyants was its operations manager.\n\nInitially, Prime Aid Pharmacies obtained retail network agreements with several pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which allowed them to receive reimbursement payments for prescription medications, including specialty medications. PBMs acted as intermediaries on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurance providers, so that when a pharmacy received a prescription, the pharmacy then submitted a claim for reimbursement to the PBM that represented the beneficiary\u2019s drug plan.\n\nStarting in 2009, in order to obtain a higher volume of prescriptions, Khaimov, Sevumyants, Fleyshmakher, and other Prime Aid employees paid bribes and kickbacks to doctors and doctors\u2019 employees to induce them to steer prescriptions to Prime Aid Pharmacies. The kickbacks included expensive meals and payments by cash, check, and wire transfers. Another method of bribery also involved paying an employee to work inside a doctor\u2019s office for the doctor\u2019s benefit.\n\nPrime Aid Union City \u2013 at the direction of Shtindler, Khaimov, and Sevumyants \u2013 also engaged in the pervasive fraudulent practice of billing health insurance providers for medications that were never provided to patients. While Prime Aid generally provided medications for initial prescriptions it received, it systematically billed for refills for those same medications without ever dispensing them to patients. From 2013 through 2017, Prime Aid Union City received over $65 million in reimbursement payments from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers for medications the pharmacy not only failed to give patients, but never even ordered or had in stock.\n\nPBMs conducted routine audits of Prime Aid Union City and discovered its practice of billing but not dispensing medications. In response to these audits, Shtindler instructed Prime Aid employees to falsify records submitted to the PBMs. Sevumyants forged shipping records of a private commercial shipping company to make it appear as if medications were shipped to the patients when, in fact, they were not.\n\nDespite these concealment efforts, some PBMs terminated the Prime Aid Pharmacies from their PBM networks. In order to continue profiting from these same PBMs, Khaimov and Shtindler opened new pharmacies, including Your Care Pharmacy in Bronx, New York, and transferred patients from the terminated Prime Aid Pharmacies to Your Care. To facilitate this scheme, Shtindler and Khaimov lied to the PBMs about the true ownership of those pharmacies, including Your Care, in order to ensure that in approving such pharmacies, the PBMs did not know the affiliation between the terminated pharmacies and the new pharmacies. This scheme resulted in one PBM being defrauded into paying Your Care over $34 million in reimbursement payments.\n\nThe superseding indictment charges each defendant as follows:\n\nCounts Defendants Charge One Khaimov Shtindler Sevumyants Health Care Fraud Conspiracy Two \u2013 Five Khaimov Shtindler Sevumyants Health Care Fraud Six Khaimov Shtindler Wire Fraud Conspiracy Seven \u2013 Nine Khaimov Shtindler Wire Fraud Ten Khaimov Sevumyants Fleyshmakher Kickback Conspiracy\n\n\n\nThe healthcare fraud counts charged in Counts One through Five are each punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison.
