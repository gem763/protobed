Lawsuit", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Newark -- part of it, anyway -- stinks.\n\nResidents of New Jersey\u2019s largest city have been complaining about the stench of carcasses emanating from Darling Ingredients Inc.\u2019s rendering plant, which turns animal byproducts and grease into feed and fuel. It\u2019s so bad that some have reported becoming ill and keeping their windows closed, according to a lawsuit filed by state regulators.\n\nThe New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office said Thursday that it found the reason for odors it termed putrid: the Irving, Texas-based company had improperly operated emissions equipment, releasing reeking gas.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that for more than nine months starting Sept. 1, 2018, Darling had 320 permit violations. Attorney General Gurbir Grewal called the lawsuit a matter of environmental justice for people who had reported migraines and nausea due to the miasma.\n\nMelissa Gaither, a Darling spokeswoman, declined to comment.\n\nThe case is State of New Jersey, Department of Environmental Protection v. Darling Ingredients Inc., C-188-19, New Jersey Superior Court, Essex County.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Elise Young in Trenton at eyoung30@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flynn McRoberts at fmcroberts1@bloomberg.net, William Selway, Stephen Merelman\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Newark -- part of it, anyway -- stinks.Residents of New Jersey\u2019s largest city have been complaining about the stench of carcasses emanating from Darling Ingredients Inc.\u2019s rendering plant, which turns animal byproducts and grease into feed and fuel.
