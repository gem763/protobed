PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Just four games into the season, injuries have decimated the top lines for the Pittsburgh Penguins as Evgeni Malkin, Nick Bjugstad, Alex Galchenyuk and Bryan Rust have all missed time.\n\nThe Penguins still have Sidney Crosby, and a trio of callups helped pick up the load on Saturday.\n\nCrosby had a goal and assist, Adam Johnson and Sam Lafferty each scored his first career goal, and the short-handed Penguins held on to beat the winless Minnesota Wild 7-4 on Saturday night.\n\nPatric Hornqvist, Kris Letang, Joseph Blandisi and Jake Guentzel also scored in Pittsburgh\u2019s first road game of the season. Matt Murray stopped 29 shots for the Penguins, who scored four times in the second period.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way you win is with everyone contributing,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cI think with those guys, just the way they skate and with how fast they are on the forecheck, and what they\u2019re able to do that way, they\u2019re going to create chances just by that. I think with every game they\u2019ll get more and more comfortable and you could see tonight, they got some huge goals for us.\u201d\n\nMinnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk gave up five goals on 23 shots and was pulled midway through the second period. Alex Stalock made seven saves in relief.\n\nJason Zucker, Jared Spurgeon, Brad Hunt and Luke Kunin scored for the Wild, who lost their home opener and fell to 0-4-0.\n\n\u201cYeah, it is frustrating right now, especially start of the season,\u201d Minnesota captain Mikko Koivu said. \u201cI think you always want that first one, obviously, as soon as you can. Things are not going our way right now. We can be here and whine about it, but you got to go forward.\u201d\n\nCrosby continued his success against Minnesota - increasing his total to 23 points in 18 career games against the Wild - but Pittsburgh got support throughout the lineup while playing without four key forwards.\n\nMalkin and Bjugstad each missed his third straight game with a lower-body injury. Malkin was placed on long-term injured reserve. Rust hasn\u2019t played this season with upper-body injury and Galchenyuk missed his second straight game with a lower-body injury.\n\nThe four combined for 72 goals and 102 assists last season.\n\nAfter breaking out for seven goals in the last game played by Malkin and Bjugstad, the Penguins had scored three goals in the previous two games. The injuries forced the callups of Johnson, Lafferty and Blandisi.\n\nThe three combined for three goals on Saturday while skating on the fourth line.\n\n\u201cI think these guys, they\u2019ve shown that they can come in and have an impact on the game,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said, noting the fourth line defended well and sustained momentum on the forecheck. \u201cWhen you can have the trust in those guys that you can put them in those situations, it can give us an opportunity to use Crosby\u2019s line for example, in an advantageous situation offensively.\u201d\n\nJohnson started a Penguins surge later in the period as they scored three times in 2:28.\n\nGuentzel scored on the power-play for a 6-2 lead midway through the third before Minnesota scored twice in 21 seconds on goals from Hunt and Kunin.\n\n\u201cI think the formula has been the same every game,\u201d Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. \u201cThey score three goals in 2 1/2 minutes \u2026 It\u2019s like we get a woe is me attitude. We\u2019re down instead of picking up our shoes like we did the last five minutes and saying let\u2019s go get them. Until we learn how to quit feeling sorry for ourselves, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Minnesota fell to 14-1-4 in home openers in franchise history. They entered the game first in league history in point percentage in home openers. \u2026 The Wild honored the National Anthem singer for the Minnesota North Stars, Jim Bowers, before the game. Bowers died in the offseason and the team used a video rendition of Bowers signing the anthem on Saturday. Minnesota\u2019s new executive advisor, Mike Modano, did the customary \u201cLet\u2019s play hockey\u201d call before the game. \u2026 Murray won his 100th career regular season game, becoming the fourth goaltender in franchise history to reach the mark. Murray is the quickest of the four, hitting the milestone in just his 166th career appearance. Only six goaltenders have reached the mark quicker in the post-expansion era. \u2026 The Wild play six of their first seven and 17 of 26 games on the road this season. The nine home games in October and November are the fewest in franchise history.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPenguins: At Winnipeg on Sunday.\n\nWild: At Ottawa on Monday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Just four games into the season, injuries have decimated the top lines for the Pittsburgh Penguins as Evgeni Malkin, Nick Bjugstad, Alex Galchenyuk and Bryan Rust have all missed time.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Hall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/penguins_wild_hockey_07468_c0-68-5114-3051_s1200x700.jpg?76323b26187b637ec94b440cc9f7c94c5a89b704", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
