It is unclear whether Sanchez Montalvo, also known as Carlos, has an attorney.\n\nHis arrest ended a frantic 24-hour search for answers after police initially reported that all men involved wore orange wristbands, fueling speculation and fear that they took drugs circulated at a nightclub and that there could be more deaths. Authorities later clarified that the danger was from drugs consumed only at the apartment.\n\nIn court documents, an FBI agent re-created the night during which a group of men at the Insomnia Discotec, a club in the Brookline neighborhood popular with the Hispanic community, offered a band there money to play at an after-party in an apartment on the city\u2019s south side, nestled into the Monongahela River.\n\nA witness told investigators that Sanchez Montalvo cut into a kilo of narcotics that the partygoers believed was cocaine. He then offered the men gathered in the apartment a sniff straight from the knife, which several did, according to a video shared with the FBI.\n\nPeople immediately began to \u201cdrop\u201d and suffer adverse affects, survivors told investigators.\n\nAt about 4 a.m. on Sunday, police and paramedics responded to a call about an unresponsive man found in an elevator. Rubiel Clemente-Martinez, 32, of Columbus, Ohio, was found dead. Police tracked his activity to apartment 421, where they found five other men.\n\nJosue Soberal Serrano, 38, of Carthage, Mo., and Joel Pecina, 32, of Coraopolis, Pa., were found dead inside, authorities said, and three others were in various states of medical emergency. Another victim was found alive in a street nearby, authorities said.\n\nPolice interviewed the person who rented the apartment, who said he was paid $500 to turn over the keys to Sanchez Montalvo for his use. Renting apartments under someone else\u2019s name is a common strategy for drug traffickers to avoid law enforcement detection, court documents said.\n\nInvestigators believe the drug is fentanyl or a fentanyl analog but said the Allegheny County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office would make that determination.\n\nRead more:\n\nHer body is rejecting a transplanted face \u2014 and one solution is unthinkable\n\nA 6-year-old threw a tantrum at school.
