Per The Tennessean, the pastor at St. Edward\u2019s School has removed the franchise from the library after consulting with exorcists around the country, all of whom believe that J.K. Rowling\u2019s works contain the legitimate power of sorcery. \u201cThese books present magic as both good and evil, which is not true, but in fact a clever deception,\u201d Reverend Dan Reehil explained in an email. \u201cThe curses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.\u201d We\u2019d alert Reehil to Dumbledore\u2019s current situation, but why do we have a feeling he couldn\u2019t handle it.", "description": "A Catholic school in Nashville has banned \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books due to the fact that the books conjure magic and spirits.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-harry-potter-book.w1200.h630.jpg"}
