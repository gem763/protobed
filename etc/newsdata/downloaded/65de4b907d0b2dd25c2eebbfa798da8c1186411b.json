As an example, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska says Spanish democracy has allowed him to marry his partner as he is homosexual.\n\nThe ministers, including the head of European Diplomacy Josep Borrell, end with the campaign motto: \"Everyone's House, Every Body's Land\". Grande-Marlaska, the astronaut and Minister of Science, Pedro Duque, and the Acting President of the Spanish Government, Carmen Calvo, among others, also took part.\n\nThe President of the Government himself has set to work. Everyone, in an almost synchronized way (at the time of writing) have tried to spread the message as much as possible, which at this time is already being troubled by the critics with the decision.", "description": "The Government of Spain and its main leaders have launched a campaign on social media under the hashtag #Everybodysland, at the same time that Spain's Supreme Court sentence  -convicting nine Catalan separatist leaders to between 9 and 13 years in prison- was made public.", "authors": ["Rafael Cereceda"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/15/24/1000x563_cmsv2_0c184423-de39-5569-abfb-e15c42fd5d73-4231524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
