Alex Albon took fifth for Red Bull, one spot ahead of team-mate Max Verstappen who fell out of the mix after he suffered an early puncture following a banzai move on Bottas.\n\nHamilton was delighted to finally claim victory at a track that has not been the most successful for him in recent years.\n\nHe was also quick to praise his Mercedes team after taking the chequered flag.\n\nHe said on Sky Sports: \"The guys have continued to work incredibly hard, stayed focused. We came here thinking we were on the back foot, knowing that it's a difficult race for us, (and) we pulled through.\n\n\"I had quite a bit of damage on my car so the race was quite a bit of a struggle, but I just kept my head down.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for today.\"", "description": "Hamilton looked after his tyres superbly and was able to keep his advantage and claim Mexican Grand Prix victory", "authors": ["Press Association", "Image", "Reuters", "Jose Mendez Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20738733.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mexican-Grand-Prix.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
