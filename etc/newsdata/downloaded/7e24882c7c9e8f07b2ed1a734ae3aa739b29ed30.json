Mainly set in Sapporo, Hokkaido, and Tokyo\u2019s Kabukicho, the eight-episode show follows Muranishi and his AV crew as they rub shoulders with yakuza and try to outmaneuver both porn industry giants and the police.\n\nBut the underworld is little more than a backdrop for The Naked Director\u2019s main focus: Muranishi\u2019s quest to push boundaries in porn. His works were among the first adult videos in Japan to involve unsimulated sex. Together with AV actress Kaoru Kuroki, Muranishi\u2019s unflinching depiction of human sexuality even helped spark a sexual revolution in Japanese society.\n\nOr so The Naked Director would have us believe.\n\nDespite paying lip service to empowerment and giving viewers a peek at the dark side of the adult video industry, the show has difficulty rising above pornographic fantasies and tropes\u2014though perhaps it never intended to.\n\nMuch like the media it glorifies, The Naked Director is more entertainment than revolutionary manifesto.\n\nPhoto: Netflix Netflix has greenlighted a second season of The Naked Director.\n\nMasturbating in the basement\n\nEpisode 1 \u201cThe Hidden Side\u201d Recap: Muranishi masters salesmanship, loses his job and his wife, and decides he wants to \u201csell desire.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, episode one of The Naked Director paints pre-AV-career Muranishi as a hapless salesman with an unsatisfying sex life\u2014a bid to make him relatable, perhaps. But from the very beginning, the show reveals that there is a porn director (star, in fact) within Muranishi waiting to be awoken.\n\nMuch like the media it glorifies, The Naked Director is more entertainment than revolutionary manifesto.\n\nAfter a short prologue, we meet our hero in a grimy basement, where he is jerking off to a copy of porn magazine Hustler. The scene\u2019s first shots show Muranishi as somewhat pathetic: he\u2019s blowing on the pages to keep them open because he doesn\u2019t have a spare hand.\n\nNext instant, we\u2019re in Muranishi\u2019s fantasy as he pounds an anonymous blonde from behind. It\u2019s a far cry from the not-so-great sex he\u2019s having at home, where his wife, Sachiko, tells him to hush up so as not to wake their two kids.\n\nThe first episode offers a fleeting, realistic depiction of porn as masturbation aid and wish fulfillment. For a short time, the audience sees from the perspective of a porn consumer (which, in all likelihood, they are) rather than porn creator, and it\u2019s not an entirely comfortable position to be in.\n\nBut for better or worse, fantasy quickly becomes reality in the world of The Naked Director.\n\nA peek behind the scenes\n\nAt the end of the episode, Muranishi\u2019s obsession with real (i.e. actually enjoyable) sex begins when gangster-lite Toshi introduces him to love hotel voyeurism. Toshi calls it \u201cthe real deal, [\u2026] a peek behind the scenes of sex.\u201d\n\nAlthough the scene Muranishi witnesses takes place in real life, it\u2019s shot as porn.\n\nPhoto: Netflix Kawada, played by Tetsuji Tamayama, joins Muranishi in launching their porn film production company Sapphire Pictures.\n\nMuranishi\u2019s peephole, a prelude to the camera viewfinders he will later use, faces a couple enjoying some energetic doggy style. The woman, who manages to praise her partner\u2019s prowess between gasps and moans, is the focus of the shot. A mirror in the background offers another view of the action. As Muranishi starts getting into it, the woman\u2019s tits bounce along to the soundtrack in slow-mo.\n\nIn his eyes, real sex and porn are one and the same. He believes it is possible for real-life sex to achieve the wild inhibition of porn, and for porn\u2014a product curated for a specific market\u2014to accurately reflect human nature.\n\nAnd yet, The Naked Director later shows us that Muranishi\u2019s vision may be misguided.\n\nSometimes, as in the scene described above, the show\u2019s camerawork represents Muranishi\u2019s point of view. However, other scenes are filmed from a detached perspective that leaves him and his work in a more ambiguous light.\n\nHe believes it is possible for real-life sex to achieve the wild inhibition of porn, and for porn\u2014a product curated for a specific market\u2014to accurately reflect human nature.\n\nDoes The Naked Director take itself seriously?\n\nEpisode 3, \u201cShake Things Up\u201d and Episode 4, \u201cThe Real Thing\u201d Recap: Muranishi assembles his AV crew; his first video depicts a high school baseball player holding a tour guide at gunpoint and having (simulated) sex with her on a baseball field. Muranishi makes an unsimulated porno based on a real sexual encounter.\n\nThe contrast between Muranishi\u2019s night with lonely widow Yoko and his porno inspired by the encounter is jarring, despite the video being his first to use \u201creal\u201d sex. Although Muranishi let himself be seduced by the widow, in his AV version she is suddenly jumped at her husband\u2019s funeral. She protests feebly (remember, guys, no means yes) before succumbing to passion.\n\nThe real widow prefers standing sex because it reminds her of her dead husband; the scene walks a razor-thin line between poignancy and ridiculousness. However, the porn version dives headlong into farce, with standing sex taken to an illogical extreme as Muranishi\u2019s actors race down Tokyo\u2019s streets in flagrante delicto.\n\nPhoto: Netflix Shinnosuke Mitsushima plays small-time crook Toshi Arai who, after witnessing a grizzly murder, ends the season being initiated into the yakuza.\n\nTwo other porn shoots in other episodes, the baseball rape fantasy and the Hawaiian sky-fuck, are similarly and inexplicably bad, full of violence and tropes. They seem almost a spoof on porn rather than an expression of Muranishi\u2019s artistic vision.\n\nYet The Naked Director appears to take these scenes seriously. After the baseball shoot, the lead actress, Naoko, says she wants to work with Muranishi again. Split screens contrast Muranishi\u2019s crew with that of rival porn mogul Ikezawa\u2014the scrappy artists are going to take on the industry and change the world.\n\nBut with what, exactly?\n\n\u201cAn assertive vagina\u201d\n\nEpisode 5, \u201cBlossoming\u201d and Episode 7, \u201cDon\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over\u201d Recap: Kaoru Kuroki joins Muranishi\u2019s crew; they shoot a porno but don\u2019t release it due to Kuroki\u2019s mother\u2019s objections. Kuroki decides to release her porno to help bail Muranishi out of jail; it\u2019s a hit.\n\nIn fact, the world changes while Muranishi languishes in American prison for two years after a shoot in Hawaii doesn\u2019t quite go to plan. (A prison rape scene, never mentioned again, is the show\u2019s biggest WTF moment.)\n\nPhoto: Netflix Muranishi, played by Takayuki Yamada, gets arrested in Hawaii.\n\nLeading the change is Kaoru Kuroki, who, in her own words, \u201cgained [her] freedom and became an assertive vagina\u201d (again, are we sure this isn\u2019t satire?) through shooting a video with Muranishi.\n\nAnd indeed, The Naked Director shows as much pubic hair as it does cunnilingus. None.\n\nHer video\u2014and it does feel like hers, as this is the only shoot where Muranishi doesn\u2019t add a story or farcical elements\u2014makes waves for its groundbreaking depiction of ravenous female desire. Kuroki goes on to become a media darling and spokesperson for sex-positivity.\n\nBut rather than ravenous desire, it is Kuroki\u2019s line, \u201cFirst make me feel safe\u201d that feels fresh. Sexual pleasure, especially for women, is context-dependent, meaning its not as fun if you feel embarrassed, stressed, or in danger. The inclusion of this simple but often-overlooked request is a highlight of The Naked Director\u2019s pursuit of real sex.\n\nProvocateur made safe for mass consumption\n\nEpisode 8, \u201cA Sexual Revolution\u201d Recap: Kuroki has become a media darling and actively speaks about sex-positivity.\n\nLike Muranishi, Kuroki\u2019s character is semi-biographical. But after reading a little about the real Kuroki, the show\u2019s version feels slightly de-fanged.\n\nIn The Naked Director, Kuroki refuses to shave her armpit hair because it\u2019s \u201cthe real her.\u201d However, according to writer Nicholas Bornoff, the real Kuroki did so \u201cas a symbolic protest against Japan\u2019s long-standing censorship of the depiction of pubic hair in print or film.\u201d Her argument against censorship is given a two-line nod in the final episode but is never elaborated on.\n\nPhoto: Netflix Misato Morita plays legendary pornstar Kaoru Kuroki.\n\nAnd indeed, The Naked Director shows as much pubic hair as it does cunnilingus. None. The missing pubes aren\u2019t entirely surprising. After all, The Naked Director was made for a global audience in the age of the bikini wax.\n\nBornoff also noted that the real Kuroki\u2019s S&M tendencies were \u201calmost frightening\u201d to some viewers, to the extent that they couldn\u2019t feel aroused by her videos. But in The Naked Director, Kuroki\u2019s sexuality is almost universally embraced. As such, her depiction on the show sometimes feels like just another fantasy for male consumption, rather than someone who fundamentally challenges men\u2019s perceptions of sex.\n\nThe end is coming\n\nOne of the season\u2019s final scenes shows Naoko, the baseball video star, shooting a condom ad. She brightly says, \u201cHey girl! You\u2019ve no need to be ashamed. We women can want sex too! But make sure you use a condom!\u201d\n\nCondoms?! Where have they been this whole time? In an interview with AsianBoss, former AV actor Taka Kato, who began his career during the time The Naked Director is set, says he used condoms in 100% of his shoots. All evidence of them was simply cut from the final product.\n\nFor the many people who learn about sex primarily from porn, that omission could have serious consequences. But consequences be damned, condoms just aren\u2019t sexy. They may be an indispensable part of real-life lovemaking, just not in The Naked Director.\n\nAs such, [Kuroki\u2019s] depiction on the show sometimes feels like just another fantasy for male consumption, rather than someone who fundamentally challenges men\u2019s perceptions of sex.\n\nA show about filming sex\n\nAs a work of fiction, The Naked Director has both thrilling highs and head-scratching lows. More than any tit or dickprint, this contrast is what makes the show intriguing.\n\nI\u2019m still on the fence as to whether Muranishi is a visionary or a hack. Although the show often seems to idolize him, we almost never see him create anything truly impressive.\n\nThe show\u2019s characterization of the adult video industry is similarly noncommittal. I can\u2019t decide whether The Naked Director\u2019s creators view porn as inherently misogynistic, a point of no return for most of the young women who get caught up in it, or as a place of empowerment for those wishing to be truly free.\n\nTrapped by the conventions of two genres\u2014TV drama and adult video\u2014The Naked Director never has a convincing message about real sex, no matter how many times the theme is harped upon.\n\nAlthough the show had a wider variety of sex scenes than the average drama, it still felt male-gazy, one-note (good lord, so much PIV), and entertainment-oriented.\n\nThe Naked Director may not inspire audiences to think about sex or porn in a new way, but as a meticulously planned and edited product, it is fascinating. Both in-show and from a meta-perspective, The Naked Director is about filming sex and how the real gets lost along the way.", "description": "", "authors": ["Annelise Giseburt", "James Darnbrook", "Kelsey Lark", "Erika Van 'T Veld"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/Netflix\u2019s-The-Naked-Director\u2019s-Dodgy-Dive-into-Japanese-Porn-lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
