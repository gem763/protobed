Tufenkji, whose done research previously on microplastics, was curious about whether the combination of this plastic bag and hot water would cause the plastic to shed microplastic particles into the cup.\n\nShe had her student Laura Hernandez shop to find an assortment of these bags, which seem to be relatively new to the market, and then tested them in her lab.\n\nThey were alarmed to discover that the bags did indeed shed large amounts of microplastic and nanoplastic particles \u2014 billions of them, in fact.\n\nTufenkji and her colleagues don't know precisely why the tea bags are shedding so much plastic. The fabric has a large surface area, and the hot water is certainly contributing to the issue, but the precise mechanism hasn't been observed yet.\n\nAs part of their recently published study they did preliminary toxicity testing on water fleas, which did show some impacts on the animals' behaviour, but it's difficult to extrapolate from that to any human health risks.\n\nTufenkji says, however, that even beyond any potential health risks, she'd avoid using the bags as they're just one more form of single use plastic that's probably unnecessary.", "description": "Canadian researchers find hot water and plastic tea bags are not an ideal combination", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5300474.1569610814!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/plastic-tea-bags.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
