The first stage sees the prime minister ask the monarch to order the prorogation. The monarch then approves a Privy Council order announcing the dates when parliament is to be prorogued.\n\nGovernment lawyers told the court that, even if Mr Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was declared unlawful, it did not mean that the Privy Council order that followed was. They said the order is a parliamentary matter and should therefore be seen as \u201cforbidden territory\u201d for the courts.\n\nAsked whether the government was suggesting that the prorogation order would still be \u201clegally effective\u201d even if Mr Johnson\u2019s advice leading to it was deemed to be unlawful, Lord Keen replied: \u201cYes. That is our position.\u201d\n\nHe said it would then be for the government to decide whether or not it wanted to reconvene parliament.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The judges could \u201cdefer that question to see what happened\u201d, she said.\n\nConcluding his argument, Lord Pannick said the government had given \u201cno coherent answer\u201d to the question of why a five-week prorogation was needed prior to the Queen\u2019s Speech and claimed there was \u201cno rational reason\u201d for such a lengthy break.\n\nHe suggested that a week-long suspension, from around 7 October, would have been more than enough to allow for the event to take place as scheduled on 14 October.\n\nClaiming that Mr Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was \u201cimproper\u201d because it had the motive and consequence of undermining parliament\u2019s ability to hold the government to account, Lord Pannick asked the court: \u201cWhy was it appropriate to prorogue for five weeks \u2013 longer, as the court knows, than on any occasion in the past 40 years?\u201d\n\nThe Court had earlier heard evidence on behalf of Sir John Major, the former prime minister.\n\nHis lawyer, Lord Garnier QC, said Sir John had made \u201ca clear and unambiguous allegation in evidence...that the reasons [for prorogation] set out in the documents put before the court by the prime minister cannot be true\u201d. He added: \u201cWhere an allegation of this kind has been made, it would be normal for there at least to be some kind of witness statement.\u201d\n\nIn a witness statement, Sir John said: \u201cThe inescapable inference to be drawn is that the prorogation is to prevent parliament from exercising its right to disagree with the government and to legislate as it sees fit.\u201d\n\nIt was, he said, \u201dutterly unacceptable\u201d for the government to \u201cseek to bypass\u201d parliament in this way. The court would be \u201cnaive\u201d to take Mr Johnson\u2019s claims at face value, he added.\n\nClosing the hearing, Lady Hale, the president of the Supreme Court, said a ruling could be expected early next week.\n\nShe reiterated \u201cthat this case is not about when and on what terms the United Kingdom leaves the European Union \u2013 the result of this case will not determine that\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are solely concerned with the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament on the dates in question. As we have heard, it is now a simple question.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson could refuse to recall parliament even if the Supreme Court rules that his decision to suspend it was unlawful, the government has said.
