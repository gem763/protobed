We don\u2019t have too much of a tennis history, but we are trying to build it. And you know what? It makes me so happy for every tennis fan in the country that Bianca is able to provide moments like this. She can attract more people to tennis. We can make it even more popular. \u201d\n\nA few hundred Canadian fans, including Vong, gathered behind the ESPN set on the grounds to celebrate, too. They cheered and waved their flags while Andreescu was interviewed, and roared when she held her trophy up to them.\n\nAndreescu, whose parents are from Romania and moved to Canada in 1994, was born in Mississauga, Ontario, in 2000, and considers herself a product of a welcoming nation.\n\n\u201cCanada is such an amazing country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so multicultural. I had no trouble growing up having Romanian parents whatsoever. That\u2019s why I love my country so, so much.\u201d\n\nPanda Vallecilla, a psychologist from Toronto, and two friends watched Andreescu\u2019s second-round win over Kirsten Flipkens on little Court 5 last week. The three Canadian comrades went back to Canada for work but vowed that if Andreescu made it to the final, they would return.\n\nVallecilla and his friends made red hats that read, \u201cShe The North\u201d \u2014 a play on the Raptors\u2019 rallying cry, \u201cWe the North.\u201d They wore shirts with Andreescu\u2019s likeness on the front and Felix Auger-Aliassime\u2019s on the back. Auger-Aliassime is one of several young Canadian players, including Denis Shapovalov, Eugenie Bouchard and Andreescu, striving to raise the profile of Canadian tennis.", "description": "In one summer, Canada gained its first N.B.A. championship and its first Grand Slam singles title in tennis.", "authors": ["David Waldstein"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/sports/07open-canada/07open-canada-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
