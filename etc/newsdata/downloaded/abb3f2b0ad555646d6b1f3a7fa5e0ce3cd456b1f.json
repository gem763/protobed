On September 13, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff accused acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, of illegally witholding from Congress a credible complaint of \u201curgent concern\u201d which had been filed by an intelligence community whistleblower. The following week, subsequent reports revealed that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was over a July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump allegedly pressed his counterpart to investigate former Vice-President Joe Biden\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine in exchange for unblocking U.S. aid to the country. (The claim that Joe Biden interfered in Ukrainian politics to aide his son Hunter has been debunked since May.)\n\nBelow is everything we know about Trump\u2019s Ukranian call, and his adminsitration\u2019s attempt to cover it up.\n\nHas anyone actually broken the law?\n\nWith regards to the allegations that Trump leveraged U.S. aid to convince a foreign leader to launch an investigation which could damage a potential rival in a presidential campaign, there are arguments for and against whether or not such an act would be illegal (and you can count Rudy \u201cNothing Is Illegal\u201d Giuliani in the latter camp.) At the Daily Beast, former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade outlined the corruption and bribery scenario:\n\nThe federal bribery statute makes it a crime for a public official to demand anything of value in exchange for performing an official act. A statute known as the Hobbs Act defines extortion as obtaining property from another, with his consent, under color of official right. \u201cProperty\u201d is defined to mean anything of value, tangible or intangible. The essence of both crimes is a demand by a public official to obtain something for himself to which he is not entitled in exchange for performing an official act of his office. \u2026\n\nTrump used the power of his office to threaten to withhold a benefit in exchange for a thing of value in violation of federal law. The nature of the purported extortion\u2014using his position as president to make demands of a foreign leader to help him win an election\u2014only makes it more egregious.\n\nThere is also the possibility of such an act being a campaign finance law violation. But as former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti argued convincingly in Politico Magazine on Sunday, if the allegations against Trump are true, \u201cit is a kind of corrupt conduct that the criminal system is not equipped to handle.\u201d\n\nA bribery charge wouldn\u2019t hold up in court, he explains, because offering military aid for a foreign investigation of a political opponent\u2019s son doesn\u2019t line up with the federal bribery statute, and extortion won\u2019t hold up either, because \u201cCourts won\u2019t send presidents to prison for cajoling foreign governments to do things, even if that involves horse trading an official act by our government in exchange for an official act by someone else\u2019s.\u201d Mariotti makes it clear that impeachment is the only recourse designed to address a transgression of this scale, and \u201cpursuing criminal cases that won\u2019t stand legal scrutiny, or arguing that Trump has violated a criminal statute, risks undermining that goal.\u201d\n\nWith regards to how the whistleblower complaint has been handled, the House Intelligence Committee chairman and other Democratic lawmakers, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, have insisted that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire continues to break the law by not providing the complaint to Congress, as he is mandated to do by the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has insisted that Maguire is following the law \u2014 at least technically.\n\nAs the Washington Post noted Sunday, there is no legal precedent for what should happen when the Intelligence Community Inspector General determines a whistleblower\u2019s complaint is credible and a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the DNI must report the complaint to Congress \u2014 but the DNI disagrees.\n\nA former general counsel to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Robert S. Litt, explained in Lawfare last week that there was a plausible legal basis for the administration\u2019s stance:\n\n[T]he Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act provides that if the [Intelligence Community Inspector General] determines that a complaint about a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d is credible, he sends it to the DNI, who within seven days \u201cshall \u2026 forward\u201d it to Congress together with any comments. But a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d is defined as \u201ca serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or Executive order, or deficiency relating to the funding, administration or operation of an intelligence activity within the authority of the Director of National Intelligence involving classified information\u201d (emphasis added). The alleged offer by the president, while perhaps criminal and possibly impeachable, does not obviously relate to any intelligence activity within the DNI\u2019s authority.\n\nStill, some have argued that the statute does not allow the DNI to make his own determination of the applicability of the statute but, instead, requires him to accept the ICIG\u2019s determination that something is a matter of urgent concern. In this case, however, it appears that the DNI went to the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) for an opinion. OLC opinions are considered to be binding and authoritative interpretations of law within the executive branch. So if OLC in fact formally opined that this complaint was not an \u201curgent concern\u201d as defined in the statute, the DNI could take the position that the ICIG must follow that interpretation.\n\nLitt also noted that White House could cite privilege regarding the president\u2019s communications with foreign leaders, as it and other administrations have successfully done in the past, to block the inspector general from disclosing what he knows. \u201cThe extent of such a privilege \u2014 and in particular whether it would protect communications that might constitute bribery \u2014 is untested, he added, \u201cbut if the White House asserted such a privilege, the [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] would be bound to honor it.\u201d\n\nStanding back, the simple explanation is that Trump administration has once again found ways to bulldoze established norms and get away with significant violations of the public trust. Tortured legal logic may work for smothering the whistleblower complaint. Committing an unprecedented crime too big and messy to prosecute or legally classify may work if the Ukraine allegations are true.\n\nWhat are the legal developments thus far?\n\nOn August 12, an unidentified member of the U.S. intelligence community submitted a complaint to (Trump-appointed) Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson which flagged troubling interactions between President Trump and a foreign leader, including making some kind of \u201cpromise\u201d to that leader. (Subsequent reporting later revealed that the conversation at issue was between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.) Atkinson reviewed the complaint, found it to be credible and of \u201curgent concern,\u201d and, on August 26, sent it to the recently appointed Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire. Per statute, Maguire was then required to report the claim to the intelligence committees in the House and Senate within a week. He failed to do that, and on September 9, Atkinson wrote the committees to make them aware of the existence of the whistleblower complaint, and Maguire\u2019s failure to report it.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff wrote Maguire the next day subpoenaing the complaint. Schiff accused him of breaking the law by withholding it and demanded to know what the whistleblower had claimed, and whether the president or other members of the executive branch had been involved in the decision to withhold the complaint from Congress. On September 13, DNI General Counsel Jason Klitenic responded to Schiff and said that after consulting with the Justice Department, they had overruled the inspector general and determined that the complaint was not of \u201curgent concern consulted the Justice Department, and claimed Maguire was not breaking the law, arguing that Maguire had overruled the inspector general and decided the complaint could not technically be classified as an \u201curgent concern\u201d since it did not pertain to a member of the intelligence community (i.e. the president) \u2014 and thus did not need to be disclosed to Congress.\n\nSchiff immediately rejected this explanation, calling it a \u201cradical distortion\u201d of the intelligence community\u2019s whistleblower statute and insisting that had \u201cneither the legal authority nor the discretion to overrule a determination by the [inspector general.]\u201d The California Democrat also concluded that the acting DNI\u2019s conduct indicated that the complaint must have involved the president or other administration officials. Schiff subpoenaed Maguire to either supply the complaint by September 17 or appear before the committee on September 19 to explain why he had not. Maguire declined.\n\nAtkinson later confirmed that he disagreed with the acting DNI\u2019s judgment regarding the facts of the complaint, but that he was \u201cbound\u201d by the DNI/DOJ decision from revealing anything else about its contents. Two days later he appeared before the committee and said the same, though he reportedly confirmed that the complaint pertained to multiple actions involving the president.\n\nWho is the whistleblower?\n\nTheir identity has not been revealed, so we only know that it was someone in the U.S. intelligence community. On Friday, CNN reported that an \u201cofficial briefed on the matter\u201d cryptically said the whistleblower \u201cdidn\u2019t have direct knowledge of the communications\u201d and that their concerns \u201ccame in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration\u2019s determination that the complaint didn\u2019t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law.\u201d The whistleblower is being represented by attorney Andrew Bakaj.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s allies have seized on this alleged lack of \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d to discredit the whistleblower, and \u201ca source close to the whistleblower\u2019s legal team\u201d who spoke to CNN contested the unnamed official\u2019s characterization. Per that report, the source \u201cpushed back strongly against the assertion that the intelligence Community\u2019s Inspector General would accept \u2018third-hand disclosures\u2019 and that what the official \u2018outlined about lack of personal knowledge and not within their course of work seems like the beginning of a smear by those trying to discredit the whistleblower.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies have also been suggesting the person was politically motivated, but that is their default claim about any critic.\n\nDid the whistleblower report anything else?\n\nNothing the whistleblower flagged in their complaint has been made public, but Inspector General Michael Atkinson told lawmakers that the complaint raised concerns about multiple actions. It\u2019s not yet clear if Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was the central \u2014 or only \u2014 focus of the complaint.\n\nRudy Giuliani\u2019s role and admission\n\nGuiliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer and his most measured advisor, has been tasked with the opposition research into vice-presidential sons. In May, he had plans to travel to Ukraine to press the government into investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings. He eventually abandoned the Kiev visit, although in August he met with a top Ukrainian official and \u201cstrongly urged\u201d him to \u201cjust investigate the darn things,\u201d referring to Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings and Ukrainian efforts to undermine Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nOn Thursday, Giuliani appeared on CNN for his usual TV routine of loudly clashing with the host and contradicting himself, claiming that he did not ask Ukraine to investigate Biden, before changing his mind about 30 seconds later.\n\nCNN's @ChrisCuomo: \"Did you ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\"@RudyGiuliani: \"Of course I did\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump's attorney says he had spoken with a Ukrainian official about Joe Biden's possible role in that government's dismissal of a prosecutor who investigated Biden's son. pic.twitter.com/hqmqtmx2VW \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 20, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s response\n\nOn the White House lawn on Sunday, the president admitted to the call with the Ukrainian president, and that the two had discussed matters related to the Biden family. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIt was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice-President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d He added that the exchange was \u201cperfect\u201d and involved no improper behavior.\n\nAfter landing in Houston in the afternoon to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi., Trump added that he would consider releasing a transcript of the call, though he was hesitant to offer such an uncharacteristic display of transparency:\n\n\u201cThe problem is, when you\u2019re speaking to foreign leaders, you don\u2019t want foreign leaders to feel that they shouldn\u2019t be speaking openly. And the same thing with an American president. You want them to be able to express themselves without knowing that every single word was going to be going out and going out all over the world.\u201d\n\nRevival of Impeachment Talk\n\nAlthough a majority of House Democrats, 138, are currently in favor of impeachment, proceedings have been dead in the water up to this point \u2014 although it\u2019s possible Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal could push Democratic lawmakers to act. On Saturday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: \u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2014 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it.\u201d\n\nEven House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who has been \u201cvery reluctant to go down the path of impeachment\u201d up until this point, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that Democrats may need to deploy the \u201cI\u201d word. \u201cWe may have crossed the Rubicon here \u2026 If the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents,\u201d Schiff said, adding that Trump\u2019s alleged request for Ukrainian intelligence to investigate Hunter Biden represents \u201cthe most profound violation of the presidential oath of office.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff says that if the reports about Pres. Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine are proven true, then impeachment may be the only \"remedy.\" \u201cThis seems different in kind and we may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.\" #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/0dsWBXpC6g \u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) September 22, 2019\n\nPelosi\u2019s response\n\nOn Sunday, Nancy Pelosi inched toward an impeachment option in a rare Dear Colleague letter in which she informed acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire that if the White House continues to block Congress from seeing the whistleblower\u2019s \u201cfull complaint,\u201d then the administration will \u201cbe entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d (Although the letter is a tiny motion toward impeachment proceedings, it\u2019s quite the departure from her past statements on the matter.)\n\nHow has Biden responded?\n\nOn Friday, the Democratic front-runner called for the release of the president\u2019s phone call transcript:\u201dIf these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Later that day, his campaign turned the issue into a fundraising opportunity, emailing supporters:\n\n\u201cEight. That\u2019s how many times Donald Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate me and my family. It\u2019s more clear than ever: We\u2019re in a battle for the soul of this nation. And now, I need you \u2013 right now. Can I count on you to donate tonight?\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail in Iowa on Sunday, Biden told reporters that Trump is \u201cviolating every basic norm of a president\u201d and called for an investigation into his \u201cconduct.\u201d He also said that he has \u201cnever spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden says Pres. Trump should \"be investigated\" over conversation with Ukrainian leader allegedly asking to investigate Biden:\n\n\n\n\"He is violating every basic norm of a president.\" https://t.co/qz8DyJyvjK pic.twitter.com/2uQezkh91l \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 22, 2019\n\nSpeaking with Politico, Monmouth pollster Patrick Murray said that \u2014 although he does not anticipate that other 2020 Democrats will attack Biden on the Ukraine point \u2014 it is possible that voters could \u201cstart worrying that this could hurt him if he is the nominee. It\u2019s \u2018can Biden fight back? Will this hurt his ability to take Trump on fully?\u2019 And will it undermine that electability argument that he\u2019s been making?\u201d\n\nIs there a Russia connection?\n\nThough it does not appear that there is a direct link to the Kremlin as in past Trump scandals, the president\u2019s alleged Ukrainian meddling certainly benefits Russian interests \u2014 particularly if the July phone call had anything to do with the August slow-walking of military aid to Ukraine. And as journalist Julia Davis notes, any news cycle that makes Ukraine and the U.S. look bad is a double-win for Russia, as its two foes become mired in controversy.\n\nRussia's state TV is eating up Trump's mess like candy, arguing that the White House is not only indifferent towards Ukraine's plight, but believes that Ukraine is \"occupying Russia's territory,\" emphasizing that the only thing Trump wants from Ukraine is the Biden investigation. pic.twitter.com/pcd4jfl8wK \u2014 Julia Davis (@JuliaDavisNews) September 21, 2019", "description": "The details of Trump\u2019s effort to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden, and the attempt to stifle a whistleblower\u2019s report.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb", "Chas Danner"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/22/trump_ukraine.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
