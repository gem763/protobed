His remaining outlet sits in an almost deserted shopping mall at the heart of a district regularly hit by sometimes violent protests that have rocked the Chinese-ruled city since June.\n\nA woman walks past a shop with a closing sale in Hong Kong, China, October 29, 2019. REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nRestaurants, hotels and retail outlets like Lam\u2019s, many of which cater to mostly mainland Chinese tourists, form a central pillar of a small business sector that employs more than one million people in the city.\n\nBut with visitors deterred by months of violence, many firms have closed or are struggling to turn a profit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a third of the pedestrian flow compared with the past. On some days, almost no shops were open in this mall,\u201d Lam said. To stay afloat, he has closed his other store in the New Territories district of Tseun Wan, the site of some violent demonstrations between protesters and police.\n\nWhen Reuters visited The Capital shopping mall, where Lam\u2019s remaining shop sits, almost half the units were closed or emptied.\n\nIn the surrounding Tsim Sha Tsui shopping and hotel precinct, many shutters on closed shops bore \u2018To Let\u2019 signs or letters demanding rent from landlords.\n\nJust last Sunday, the district was blanketed in tear gas during cat-and-mouse clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters.\n\nIt was the 21st consecutive weekend of protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nThe unrest has dealt a double blow to the financial hub, which was already grappling with sluggish economic growth.\n\nGovernment support has been modest, and there is little optimism amid a record decline in retail sales, rising unemployment and bankruptcies that have started to hit banks\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nLarger firms impacted by the protests can often fall back on their wider footprint, access to emergency capital or international business, industry watchers say, but for many small firms there is no such safety net.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious situation,\u201d said Brian King, associate dean of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\n\u201cThere is no buffer for the owners - it\u2019s not easy for them to get loans and there\u2019s not a particularly strong welfare system in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWAITING TO DIE\u201d\n\nConfirming the city entered recession in the third quarter, the city\u2019s finance chief Paul Chan on Sunday urged an end to violence.\n\nChan earlier this month said at least 100 restaurants have closed due to the unrest with about 2,000 employees affected.\n\nHong Kong is home to around 340,000 small and medium sized firms, according to official figures, providing jobs for about 1.3 million people. That accounts for around 45% of total employment, excluding the civil service, and 98% of business units covered by quarterly government surveys.\n\nHigh street rents in the city, among the most expensive in the world, fell the most since the 1998 Asian financial crisis in the third quarter, while authorities have repeatedly called for landlords to cut rents during the crisis.\n\nBut, for many small firms, that may not be enough to stave off closure.\n\n\u201cMany stores are waiting to die,\u201d said Bob Yip, operator of Wing Li Dispensary, located on the popular protest route of Causeway Bay on Hong Kong island.\n\nYip said his business, which mainly caters to tourists from mainland China, has dropped by 80%, while his local custom has dwindled due to regular closures of the transport network during the protests.\n\nYip said the government was not doing enough to resolve the disputes with pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nOthers say police tactics are making the situation worse.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nOn Sunday, a tear gas canister landed inside a pharmacy during clashes in Yau Ma Tei district, sending spluttering shoppers and workers fleeing from the cramped, smoke-filled store, local media coverage of the incident showed.\n\nThe shopkeeper, surnamed Wu, told local media four representatives of the police visited the store on Monday morning and said they were sorry, without explaining why tear gas was fired at the pharmacy.\n\n\u201cWe already half-closed our shutter when the tear gas canister was thrown into our shop suddenly,\u201d Wu told local broadcaster RTHK. \u201cWe all ran outside. There weren\u2019t many people on the streets but the police fired tear gas nevertheless.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong jeweller Jun Lam has already closed one shop.
