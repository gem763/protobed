It\u2019s Another Sign of Worry About the Economy.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nInvestors should avoid Textron shares, according to Vertical Research Partners aerospace and defense analyst Rob Stallard. It\u2019s yet another sign of concern about the state of the economy.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Stallard downgraded shares of the industrial conglomerate from Buy to Hold, trimming his target for the stock price to $54, less than 10% above recent levels. Stallard described the move as \u201ctaking risk off the table.\u201d\n\nTextron (ticker: TXT) shares have struggled for a while. The stock is up 9% year to date, worse than the 17% gain of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Over the past year, Textron shares are down almost 30%, while the Dow has risen 3%.\n\nWeakening industrial end markets have weighed on the stock. Growth in global industrial production peaked in late 2017 and has decelerated for the past 20 months. U.S. industrial activity contracted for the first time in more than three years in August. About two-thirds of Textron sales is tied to aerospace and defense\u2014a better-performing end market\u2014but Textron has also experienced sales declines in its helicopter and private-jet businesses in recent quarters.\n\n\u201cSmall bizjet historically sensitive to the economy,\u201d Stallard wrote. \u201cWhile the newly certified Longitude should be ramping up through 2020, the rest of the portfolio could be vulnerable to easing demand.\u201d Textron\u2019s newest jet, the Longitude, is ready to sell, but that might not be enough to overcome the damage from a weaker economy, according to the analyst.\n\nThe good news for contrarian investors is the stock is cheap, relatively speaking. Textron shares trade for less than 13 times estimated 2020 earnings, a discount to other stocks in the Dow and other industrial components of the S&P 500. Those shares trade for between 15 and 16 times estimated earnings for next year, on average.\n\nPart of the reason Textron gets a lower valuation from investors is its exposure to the car industry. Many auto makers and parts companies trade for less than 10 times estimated earnings. Investors worry that falling global demand for light vehicles will crimp profits.\n\nLike investors, Textron isn\u2019t in love with the automotive business. It announced plans to dispose of its Kautex division in August.\n\n\u201cTextron has sensibly, if belatedly, decided to review its ownership of Kautex, which produces automotive equipment,\u201d wrote Stallard. \u201cWhile a sale of this business is likely to be around 9% dilutive to 2020 free cash flow per share and earnings per share, it does reduce exposure to the challenging auto market.\u201d\n\nA Kautex sale will reduce Textron earnings. And any business Textron could buy with the cash received, including its own shares, wouldn\u2019t make up the earnings gap. That\u2019s a good definition of \u201cdilutive.\u201d The fact that selling Kautex could be a positive for investor sentiment says a lot about how Wall Street feels about the automotive sector lately.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "Vertical Research Partners suggest investors step to the sidelines and avoid shares of the industrial conglomerate.", "authors": ["Al Root"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111611/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
