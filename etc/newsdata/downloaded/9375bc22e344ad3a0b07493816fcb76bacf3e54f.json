She also will be placed on supervised release for one year.\n\nRELATED: Felicity Huffman Sentenced to 14 Days Behind Bars in College Admissions Scandal\n\nView photos Feliocity Huffman with husband William H.

Williams-Bolar\u2019s case propelled her to a spot on the Dr. Phil show, and after the Ohio parole board declined to pardon her crime, then-Gov. John Kasich reduced her two convictions to misdemeanors, reports the Journal Beacon.\n\n\u201cWhen it first ran across my timeline, my eyebrows kind of went up,\u201d Williams-Bolar says of the charges against Huffman and others, including fellow actress Lori Loughlin, who were among 50 people named March 12 by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Massachusetts as participants in the cheating scandal.\n\nThe two actresses, along with coaches, counselors, parents, and Loughlin\u2019s husband, fashion designer J. Mossimo Giannulli, were indicted on accusations of falsifying test scores and lying about the athletic skills of their children, among other alleged crimes, to boost their appeal on college admissions applications. (Loughlin and Giannulli have pleaded not guilty.)\n\nRELATED: Felicity Huffman Recalls Shame of Explaining Her Crime to Daughter: \u2018I Had No Adequate Answer\u2019\n\nView photos Felicity Huffman | Charles Krupa/AP/Shutterstock More", "description": "Mom Imprisoned for Falsifying Kids' School District Speaks Out", "authors": ["Jeff Truesdell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MEw9dE144BHueFR4zsyuqA--~B/aD04MzI7dz0xMzQ3O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/149cbb39bc418dc4c76877d3309c1773", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
