The last Japanese to race in Formula One was Kamui Kobayashi with now-defunct Caterham in 2014.\n\nYamamoto, 31, is reigning champion in Japanese Super Formula and the Super GT touring car series, where he has partnered 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson Button.\n\nHis age rules him out, however, as a realistic race prospect for a team that develops and feeds young talent to the main Red Bull outfit.\n\n\u201cIt will be a special moment and I\u2019m glad I will get to share it with the fans at this amazing race track, where I first watched Formula One cars in action 27 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nYamamoto will take Pierre Gasly\u2019s car for the session before handing it back to the Frenchman for the rest of the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe hope Naoki makes the most of this opportunity, that he learns from it and that it helps him as a racing driver,\u201d said Katsuhide Moriyama, Honda\u2019s head of brand operations in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe also hope that seeing Yamamoto on track will serve as an inspiration to young Japanese drivers, so that in the near future we can once again have Japanese drivers competing in Formula One.\u201d\n\nHonda-backed Nobuharu Matsushita is competing in Formula Two this season while Yuki Tsunoda is a race winner in Formula Three.", "description": "Honda-backed Japanese Naoki Yamamoto will take part in a Formula One grand prix weekend for the first time on Friday when he drives a Toro Rosso in opening practice at his home Suzuka circuit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
