REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nLam is to attend Emperor Naruhito\u2019s enthronement ceremony in Tokyo\u2019s imperial palace on Tuesday and return home that evening.\n\nEarly on Monday, Hong Kong embarked on a massive clean-up after a largely peaceful protest degenerated into violence across districts on the Kowloon peninsula, where protesters torched stores and sprayed grafitti on roads, amid skirmishes with police.\n\nAfter two weeks of relative calm in the five-month long political crisis, Sunday\u2019s large turnout reflected strong support for the anti-government movement despite police branding the march illegal, because of concerns over public safety.\n\nFamilies and the elderly took to the streets of the Asian financial hub in what began as a peaceful march, many wearing masks or carrying umbrellas to shield their faces, despite the threat of being arrested.\n\nHowever, a more radical faction of mainly young protesters later clashed with riot police.\n\nThey targeted banks and other businesses perceived to be linked to China, damaging some store fronts and setting fires on the prime shopping and commercial street of Nathan Road in the heart of the Kowloon peninsula.\n\nThe events followed an annual policy speech last week by Beijing-backed Lam in which she did not address protesters\u2019 demands, but sought to ease tension with measures aimed at resolving a chronic housing shortage.\n\nProtesters say they will keep up pressure on the government to act on their demands for universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those charged, and an end to describing protesters as rioters.\n\nMetro operator MTR Corp said it would shut the rural Yuen Long station by 2 p.m., ahead of a protest planned there later on Monday.\n\nSeveral subway entrances and exits would also be shut, and the entire network would close by 10 p.m., or two hours early, to allow time for the repair of facilities, the operator said.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s clashes, police used water cannon trucks to disperse protesters, spraying jets of blue dye into the crowds and sending hundreds fleeing.\n\nIn one instance, a water cannon fired a jet towards the front gate of the Kowloon mosque, Hong Kong\u2019s most important Islamic place of worship.\n\nBlue dye still smeared the road as worshippers gathered for prayers on Monday, with many saying they did not understand why police had targeted the mosque as there had been few people nearby.\n\nThe mosque entrance and front gate had been accidentally sprayed, police said in a statement.\n\n\u201cPolice respect religious freedom and will strive to protect all places of worship,\u201d they added.\n\nThe mosque incident is the first time the protests have affected religious groups, but the unrest has hammered much of Hong Kong\u2019s business, retail and tourism sectors.\n\nVisitor numbers have plummeted as tourists stay away, further hampering an economy facing its first recession in a decade.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe government was trying its best to support small and medium sized enterprises as the economy has been hit hard, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are studying the launch of the third round of relief measures,\u201d he wrote on his blog.\n\nBusinesses will probably have to foot the bill for the vandalism, as few had insurance for riot damage, industry insiders said.", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, leaves for a visit to Japan on Monday as the Chinese-ruled city struggles to recover from a night of violence in which tens of thousands took to the streets, with further protests planned later in the day.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443183728&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K03G", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
