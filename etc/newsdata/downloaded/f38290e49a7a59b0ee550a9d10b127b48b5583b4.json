It ain't about the football. I know I can do that. I show you guys that on the daily.\"\n\nThe seven-time Pro Bowler has been the story of the offseason after forcing his way out of Pittsburgh and landing a new three-year, $50.1 million deal following his trade to Oakland.\n\nAnd that was just the start of what has been an unusual offseason, to say the least.\n\nThe 31-year-old missed time during training camp and the preseason after he suffered extreme frostbite when he didn't wear proper footwear in a cryotherapy machine. He was then locked in a prolonged battle with the league as he sought to continue to wear his preferred helmet, which is no longer approved under NFL rules.\n\nAfter having two grievances denied, Brown found a new helmet and even came out of the matter with an endorsement deal, which he called the \"most calculated move by far.\"\n\nBrown found himself facing suspension after he had a heated exchange with general manager Mike Mayock on Wednesday, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter, a matter that stemmed from the receiver being fined by the team and subsequently posting the fine letter on social media:\n\nThere was speculation that the Raiders were looking to suspend Brown in order to eventually void the $30.1 million guaranteed and release him. Ultimately, though, Oakland did not suspend him after he apologized to the team Friday, per ESPN's Josina Anderson. He was fined for the exchange with Mayock, though, according to ESPN's Ed Werder.\n\nIn the video, Gruden asks the outspoken star if he wants to be a Raider.\n\n\"Man, I've been trying to be a Raider since Day 1,\" Brown said. \"... I don't know why it's a question of me being a Raider. It's like, do you guys want me to be a Raider?\"\n\nJenny Vrentas of Sports Illustrated raised an interesting fact:\n\nWill Brinson of CBS Sports also threw out some thoughts on the situation:\n\nBut according to ESPN's Chris Mortensen, there are no issues here:\n\nOakland's season does not kick off until Monday night against the Denver Broncos.", "description": "Amid never-ending drama in the Bay Area,  Oakland Raiders  star  Antonio Brown  has posted a video in order to \"control [his] own narrative...", "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/826/935/hi-res-8d4f45b449029cbd938bdd6ef8844d2b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
