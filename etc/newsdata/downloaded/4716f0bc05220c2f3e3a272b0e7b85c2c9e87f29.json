You better make sure before you try it.", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s no easy-to-use, universally trusted reference source for international travelers concerned about water safety. Keeping such a list is impractical. Water quality can vary by country, region or city. Generally speaking, you can trust the water in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America and Western Europe, experts say. Everywhere else, you should assume the water is unsafe until you know for sure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow can you determine whether the water is safe to drink? Evan Lorendo, a business development consultant who lives in Tanzania, says you should look around at a traffic stop. If the street vendors are selling bottled water to the tourists, there\u2019s probably an issue with the drinking water.\n\n\u201cAlso look at the menus at restaurants,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf there\u2019s a mention of ice made from bottled water, then you know that it is an issue.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are more scientific ways of determining whether the water is safe to drink. For example, you can buy a drinking water test kit like First Alert\u2019s (about $17), which identifies bacteria, lead, pesticides, nitrates and nitrites, and chlorine in the water. But most commercially available test kits don\u2019t cover every contaminant.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDrinkable water should be clear, odorless, and it shouldn\u2019t feel yucky on your hands after washing them with soap,\u201d says Nikola Djordjevic, a physician who co-founded the company MedAlertHelp.org, a medical alert service.\n\nAD\n\nBut he cautions that the sniff test and common test kits are not always enough to determine whether the water is drinkable. Other water safety experts agree that when it comes to water safety, a visual inspection is insufficient.\n\n\u201cObviously bad water is easy to spot,\u201d says Chris Davis, an emergency medicine physician at the UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital. \u201cBut water contaminated with the bacteria that causes diarrhea often has no odor, and the water can appear clean.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDavis says the most comprehensive and accurate source of information on safe drinking water is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s country health database. Look for the Travelers\u2019 Health section, and search by destination. You\u2019ll find all sorts of useful tips, including whether the local tap water is safe.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, consider Tanzania. The CDC recommends avoiding tap or well water, ice made with tap or well water, drinks made with tap or well water (such as reconstituted juice), and unpasteurized milk.\n\nFred Gaines, a retired engineer who spent more than 45 years working in the sanitation and wastewater business, says it\u2019s impossible to be too careful.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re traveling, use extreme caution,\u201d he says. \u201cEven water that is considered safe to drink may contain microorganisms that might disagree with travelers accustomed to the water distributed in their community.\u201d\n\nIn other words, you could get the green light to drink the water and still get sick.\n\nSo what to do? Experts say you should err on the side of caution.\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling outside the safe zones, assume the water is undrinkable. Consume only bottled water, which is generally manufactured under sanitary conditions. Brush your teeth using bottled water, too.\n\nAD\n\nAnd consider the source of the water even if it\u2019s in a bottle. One of my readers always grabs several Fiji waters at the airport, because he knows they\u2019re safe.\n\nAD\n\nIce is a common \u201cgotcha\u201d for American tourists. We love ice in our drinks, but restaurants don\u2019t always use bottled water to make it. I\u2019ve heard many stories of visitors pouring bottled water into a glass with ice cubes, only to realize too late that the ice was made from tap water. \u201cIce is often overlooked by travelers,\u201d says Joe Brown, a water safety expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nA related caution: Avoid raw foods like salads and produce. They\u2019re usually washed in tap water and may be contaminated.\n\nIf you\u2019re staying for a while, consider bringing a personal water filter such as the LifeStraw (about $17) on your next adventure, experts say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese precautions aren\u2019t foolproof. On my last trip to Africa, I stuck to bottled water and carefully avoided raw food. And then I got sick anyway.\n\nHow did it happen? I reviewed every point of contact with water. I only drank clean water. I avoided any potentially contaminated food. I even brushed my teeth with bottled water.\n\nThen I realized I must have ingested a small amount of water in the shower. And that\u2019s all it took.\n\nRead more from Travel:\n\nAD", "description": "Taking precautions is always a good idea, and even then, you could still get sick.", "authors": ["Christopher Elliott"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dqOgHDmcQ30AJCcYAZ1kCRXhYW4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LZ727SXLQUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
