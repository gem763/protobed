Kavanaugh marked the first anniversary Sunday of his overcoming a bruising confirmation battle to claim a seat on the Supreme Court, solidifying a conservative majority forged by President Trump\u2019s nominations.\n\nHis presence moved the bench to the right and opened the door to new tests of abortion rights, religious liberty and other longstanding rulings.\n\n\u201cConservatives know how important the court is and how significant President Trump\u2019s ability to nominate these two justices was, so this is just another example of his judicial legacy,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s second high-court pick took the seat of retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who was long seen as the bench\u2019s swing vote. It\u2019s now Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who has taken on the pendulum role \u2014 not Justice Kavanaugh, though he did side with Justice Roberts 92% of the time last term, according to the Empirical SCOTUS Blog.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito, who has built a reputation as a loyal rightist voice on the bench, sided the most with Justice Kavanaugh last year.\n\n\u201cThe court is now comprised of such a large number of textualists and originalists,\u201d said Ms. Severino.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh made his stamp on the issue of religious liberty in a case last term that tested the legality of a nearly 100-year-old Peace Cross on public land in Maryland that was built as a tribute to fallen World War I soldiers.\n\nA secular group challenged the memorial, saying it ran afoul of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution that prevents the government\u2019s endorsement of religion, also loosely called the separation of church and state.\n\nIn another opinion defending the constitutionality of the cross, Justice Kavanaugh wrote, \u201cThe practice of displaying religious memorials, particularly religious war memorials, on public land is not coercive and is rooted in history and tradition.\u201d\n\nAnd in a case brought by a Buddhist death row inmate in Texas, challenging prison policies that only permitted a prison chaplain or a Muslim imam in the execution chamber rather than the clergy of his religion, Justice Kavanaugh sided with the Buddhist man.\n\n\u201cThe government may not discriminate against religion generally or against particular religious denominations,\u201d Justice Kavanaugh said.\n\nIt was a reversal for the court, which stayed the man\u2019s execution at the time, but failed to do so for a Muslim inmate in Alabama about a month earlier. He raised similar arguments that the Alabama prison was not permitting his imam in the chamber.\n\nCourt watchers, though, say less is known about how Justice Kavanaugh will come down on legal conflicts dealing with abortion.\n\nCurt Levey, president of the Committee for Justice, said pro-life groups hoping Justice Kavanaugh is more friendly to their arguments than Justice Kennedy had been likely will be pleased.\n\nWhile he thinks Justice Kavanaugh could uphold some limitations on abortion, Mr. Levey is doubtful the newest justice would be a solid vote to overturn outright Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark ruling legalizing abortion nationwide.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone out of his way to seem like a friend to women,\u201d Mr. Levey said, pointing to his grueling confirmation hearing in which he weathered an onslaught of unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct from his high school and college days.\n\nThe charge against Justice Kavanaugh was led by Christine Blasey Ford, who testified at the confirmation hearings and accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers at a high school party in Washington\u2019s affluent Maryland suburbs. Her allegation was never corroborated and Justice Kavanaugh vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBut progressives mounted fierce opposition to his nomination largely on the grounds that he would rule against women\u2019s rights.\n\nDebra Katz, Ms. Blasey Ford\u2019s attorney, even said her client came forward because she wanted an \u201casterisk\u201d by Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s name when he rules on abortion-related cases.\n\nMore than a half-million dollars was raised in support of Ms. Blasey Ford, who said she had to move her family due to security concerns during the hearing.\n\nMs. Katz and Ms. Blasey-Ford refused to comment for this report.\n\nThey also refused to disclose where the funds were spent. In a post to the GoFundMe account late last year, Ms. Blasey Ford said she would use the money for security purposes.\n\nA year after the confirmation battle, Ms. Blasey Ford remains the bane of conservative activists.\n\n\u201cA year ago Debra Katz claimed her client Christine Blasey Ford did not have a political motivation in bringing her allegations, but now the cat\u2019s out of the bag. Katz admitted Ford was motivated in part by Roe v. Wade,\u201d said Mike Davis, president for the Article III Project that fights for the confirmation of Mr. Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\n\u201cThe Justice Department should investigate Ford for potential perjury because her attorney is now directly contradicting her sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 so either Katz is lying or Ford is lying,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, court watchers say it\u2019s still somewhat early to know exactly where Justice Kavanaugh will fall on the conservative wing of the court.\n\n\u201cJustices often develop their own style of jurisprudence particular to the Supreme Court after the first term so it is hard to draw clear inferences about Kavanaugh,\u201d said Adam Feldman, founder of the Empirical SCOTUS Blog.\n\n\u201cThere is still a question about where he will land. I think he will land closer to Roberts,\u201d Mr. Levey said. \u201cThe further we get from his confirmation, the true Kavanaugh will come out.\u201d\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, though, only agreed with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, the president\u2019s first high court pick, 70% of the time.\n\nThat\u2019s the lowest percentage of agreement between two justices appointed by the same president in more than 50 years.\n\nJustice Gorsuch has been more like the late Justice Antonin Scalia, having a libertarian bent, while Justice Kavanaugh has been more of a moderate like Justice Roberts, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single type of Trump nominee,\u201d Mr. Blackman said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
