The destination of the Ashes has already been decided, and Australia celebrated the retention of the urn at Old Trafford like schoolkids on the last day of term, complete with drinking on a playing field and mocking some kid with glasses. Meanwhile England have been putting the right words in the right order to make it appear they are desperate to win at the Oval to draw the series, but there\u2019s been a distinct lack of oomph to the platitudes, like that time Celine Dion covered ACDC. England\u2019s selectors could have done more to heighten anticipation by selecting a couple of greenhorns in advance of overseas tours, but they\u2019ve stuck with the same bunch that have largely failed to capture the imagination, relying on flashes of individual brilliance from a small number of performers to even make a contest out of a series played mostly on Australia\u2019s terms.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, the weather is set fair for five days, there\u2019s not a spare seat in the house, and we should all be cherishing the opportunity to witness Steve Smith bat in such groundbreaking form. Now the Ashes have been resolved and the boos silenced, let\u2019s celebrate the greatness in our midst.\n\nI\u2019ll be around for the next hour or so before Adam Collins takes you through the morning session of play.
