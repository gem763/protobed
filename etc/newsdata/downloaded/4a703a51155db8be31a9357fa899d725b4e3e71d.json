A Twitter spokesperson declined to elaborate on how these accounts were identified.\n\nTwitter did say that the suspended accounts were all used at some point to promote China's official narrative on Hong Kong's protests, which casts the mass movement as a willfully destructive mob pushing for regime change in Hong Kong.\n\nNPR's data team and Beijing correspondent took a deep dive into the more than 900 accounts Twitter identified as linked to a Chinese state effort to discredit Hong Kong protesters. Here's what we found.\n\nTweets about, well, all sorts of things\n\nThe suspended Twitter accounts did not share exclusively pro-Beijing posts or content against the Hong Kong protests.\n\nIn fact, the accounts with the highest number of retweets or likes were about pornography. Tweets about cute animals also performed well.\n\nMany of the accounts were created years ago \u2014 one as early as 2007 \u2014 and tweeted in various languages, including Indonesian, Arabic and English.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above?

NPR's research surfaced several instances where, after years of tweeting in one language, accounts suddenly began tweeting in Chinese in the last year and a half.\n\nThis thread, posted by a Chinese data scientist who asked NPR not to use his name because of political sensitivities, delves into one suspended account and the disinformation campaigns for which it was apparently used.\n\nAccounts used repeatedly for different disinformation or promotional campaigns over the years could have been purchased through what's known as the darknet \u2014 the portion of the global Internet that is uncatalogued and accessible only through specialized browsers.\n\n\"In the same places where you can buy software exploits from Russian hackers and ransomware, there are also actors that offer what they call disinformation as a service: either building up an entity positively on social media or negatively, by tearing them down or spreading compromising information,\" says Priscilla Moriuchi, a research head at Recorded Future, a digital risk and intelligence company in the Boston area.\n\nPolitics Experts Warn U.S. Should Prepare For Election Interference From China Experts Warn U.S. Should Prepare For Election Interference From China Listen \u00b7 3:49 3:49\n\nStealing and repurposing social media accounts is also common, says Moriuchi: \"After selling credit card numbers, selling leaked credentials on a massive scale is a pretty large business enterprise, and the credentials are really cheap.\"\n\nDocuments show that Chinese government agencies pay to acquire more social media followers. A tender posted on Aug. 16 by Chinese state-run outlet China News offers 1.25 million yuan ($176,900) to acquire more Twitter followers. Another government tender posted a few days later offers 750,000 yuan ($106,120) to acquire more Facebook and Twitter followers to support an exposition of Asian countries being held in China's Guangxi province in September.\n\nLast year, The New York Times reported that China's state news agency Xinhua was among dozens of clients that paid a prominent bot factory to acquire Twitter followers.\n\nPost-election spike\n\nDemonstrations in Hong Kong began on March 31 against a bill that would have allowed the extradition of crime suspects to mainland China, but they expanded into a movement to improve democracy and lessen the central Chinese government's influence in the city. On Sept. 4, Hong Kong's leader killed the bill, but protests continue.\n\nNPR found activity from the now-suspended Twitter accounts increased after the Hong Kong protests began. But the accounts were most active more than two years earlier: right after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above?

Diving into the data, we see a sudden surge of Chinese-language accounts beginning in late 2017.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here.\n\nBetween December 2017 and February 2018, the majority of these new accounts tweeted in Chinese. From then on, posts in Chinese climbed from effectively zero to between 15% and 35% of tweets.\n\nEngage and retreat\n\nAfter these new Chinese-language accounts emerged, we see a corresponding uptick in engagement with them. Simply put, they were retweeted and liked much more than previous Chinese-language tweets by the banned accounts.\n\nThe most dramatic rise in such engagement happened in early December 2018. A series of protests organized by retired military veterans had broken out across China, embarrassing the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which has long drawn political support from veterans. Tweets discrediting the protests, along with reshares and likes of those tweets, quickly spread.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above?

If you just say something enough times, it becomes truth on social media,\" says Recorded Future's Moriuchi.\n\n\"Will not cease\"\n\nTwitter faces an uphill battle against disinformation. The company has drawn broad criticism for failing to prevent these campaigns from spreading.\n\n\"These shutdowns are probably a very small percentage of what these countries actually have operating,\" Watts says.\n\nIn its statement, Twitter acknowledged one reality of disinformation campaigns: \"It is clear that information operations and coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease.\"\n\nAmy Cheng contributed reporting from Beijing.
