After Trump was elected, Trump fixer Michael Cohen asked for all of AMI\u2019s materials about Trump.\n\n\u201cThere was an internal debate: some were starting to realize that surrendering it all would create a legally problematic paper trail, and resisted,\u201d Farrow writes in \u201cCatch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators\u201d which will be published on Tuesday. \u201cNevertheless, Howard and senior staff ordered the reporting material that wasn\u2019t already in the small safe exhumed from storage bins in Florida and sent to AMI headquarters.\u201d\n\nWhen the material came to the AMI headquarters, it was first put into the small safe. Then, as the scandal around the magazine\u2019s close relationship with Trump deepened, it was placed into a bigger safe in the office of AMI\u2019s head of human resources, Daniel Rotstein.\n\n\u201cIt was only later, when one of the employees who had been skeptical started getting jumpy and went to check, that they found something amiss: the list of Trump dirt didn\u2019t match up with the physical files,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cSome of the material had gone missing.\u201d\n\nHoward told colleagues that none of the material was destroyed, but Farrow\u2019s sources expressed skepticism.\n\n\u201cWe are always at the edge of what\u2019s legally permissible,\u201d one senior AMI employee told Farrow. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, Howard attorney Paul Tweed said: \u201cWe have advised Mr. Howard to make no further comment at this stage, while all legal options and jurisdictions are being considered.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported in early October that the Tweed law firm sent threatening letters to a number of U.K. booksellers as well as Farrow\u2019s British publisher saying there were \u201cfalse and defamatory allegations\u201d in his book.\n\nAn American Media spokesperson said: \u201cMr. Farrow\u2019s narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Trump Organization didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Hatchette, which is publishing a book by Levine about Trump and women, declined to comment. Rotstein, who no longer works at AMI, could not be reached for comment.\n\nTrump had a decades-long close relationship with AMI CEO David Pecker and in turn, Pecker and the Enquirer protected Trump from his own misdeeds with a tabloid practice called \u201ccatch and kill\u201d in which the Enquirer bought up embarrassing stories involving Trump and then wouldn\u2019t publish them.\n\nFarrow quotes one former Enquirer journalist, Jerry George, who estimates that Pecker \u201ckilled perhaps ten fully reported stories about Trump, and nixed many more potential leads during George\u2019s twenty-eight years at the Enquirer.\u201d\n\nLate last year, AMI admitted its hush money payment to McDougal, which it said it had done to prevent her story from \u201cinfluencing the election.\u201d In an agreement with federal prosecutors that said AMI would not get charged for its role in the scheme, the company said it would cooperate with authorities.\n\nThe agreement showed that Pecker held a meeting with Cohen and at least one other member of the campaign in August 2015, during which Pecker \u201coffered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate\u2019s relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\u201d He also agreed to keep Cohen updated on any negative stories.\n\nA month before the 2016 election, an agent for pornographic actress Stormy Daniels told Howard that she was threatening to speak publicly about her alleged affair with Trump. That led Pecker and Howard to tell Cohen about Daniels; he then negotiated a deal to pay her $130,000 in exchange for her silence. Cohen is serving a three-year jail sentence for campaign finance violations related to his role in the scheme.\n\nAMI had previously denied engaging in such a practice, telling the Wall Street Journal in November 2016, \u201cAMI has not paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nThe National Enquirer, which is in the process of being sold to the CEO of Hudson News for $100 million, endorsed Trump in the 2016 campaign and wrote negative stories on his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, with covers bearing headlines like \u201c\u2018Sociopath\u2019 Hillary Clinton\u2019s Secret Psych Files Exposed!\u201d and \u201cHillary: Corrupt! Racist! Criminal!\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5a/67/82fdf06d4f109ac526498c673778/191014-ronan-farrow-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
