I hope that people can give me a chance to live again, give me a chance to pay back society.\u201d\n\nChan confirmed his plans to surrender to authorities in Taiwan, where he is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend. \u201cI am willing to turn myself in for my impulse, the wrong things I\u2019ve done, and serve sentence and be tried in Taiwan.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It is not yet known when Chan plans to return to Taiwan.\n\nHis release has sparked a dispute between Hong Kong and Taiwan on how to handle his surrender. In the early morning hours Tuesday, the Hong Kong government issued a statement rejecting Taiwan\u2019s request to send officials to Hong Kong to escort Chan back to Taipei. Hong Kong wants Chan to travel to Taiwan himself and turn himself in informally.\n\nAt stake is the hugely sensitive issue of Taiwan\u2019s status. Beijing regards the island as a renegade province; self-governing Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign nation.\n\nIf Hong Kong were to allow Taiwanese law enforcement officials to land and take custody of Chan, it could be seen as a de facto extradition agreement with a foreign power, and thus a tacit recognition that Taiwan is not part of the \u2018One China\u2019 that Beijing insists it is.\n\nRead More: Taiwan Asks Hong Kong for Return of the Murder Suspect Whose Case Sparked Months of Protests\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, used Chan\u2019s murder case to justify the fast-track introduction of a bill that would have allowed the transfer of criminal suspects to jurisdictions where Hong Kong did not have extradition agreements, including Taiwan but more controversially mainland China.\n\nThe proposed legislation was met with mass opposition in Hong Kong, after critics argued that Beijing would use the measure to round-up its political opponents in the semi-autonomous territory. A series of peaceful mass marches beginning in June morphed into frequent, violent protests, with protesters now calling for greater political freedom and repudiating Beijing\u2019s sovereignty over the former British colony.\n\nThe extradition bill is expected to be formally withdrawn by the city\u2019s legislature on Wednesday.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Aria Chen / Hong Kong\n\nWrite to Amy Gunia at amy.gunia@time.com.", "description": "Chan Tong-kai walked from a Hong Kong prison Wednesday amid a row between Hong Kong and Taiwan over what to do with him next.", "authors": ["Amy Gunia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/murder-suspect-extradition-bill.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C78px%2C841px%2C440px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
