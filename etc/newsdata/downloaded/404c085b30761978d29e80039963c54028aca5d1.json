The venerable true-crime storyteller is lending his signature narration style to podcasting to tell one of the most bizarrely serpentine stories Dateline has ever covered. And in a first for Morrison, who has worked at the news magazine for 25 years, one of the story\u2019s many twists and turns led right back to Dateline itself.\n\n\u201cSomeone actually went around trying to con other people by portraying herself as a producer on our show,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s new to me! I hadn\u2019t encountered that one before.\u201d\n\nThe story begins with the brutal murder of Betsy Faria in 2011, a case that Dateline has covered four times over the years. But this year, new developments in the case gave Dateline producers the impetus to revisit the murder for its second-ever podcast. (The first, 13 Alibis, was released in May.) In June, 60-year-old Pamela Hupp was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing a physically and mentally disabled man in what authorities believe was part of a plot to divert attention from an older case \u2014 the murder of Faria, who was Hupp\u2019s best friend. Russ Faria, the victim\u2019s husband, was convicted of her murder in 2013, but the conviction was overturned and he was acquitted in a new trial. Hupp became the beneficiary of Betsy Faria\u2019s $150,000 insurance policy shortly before she was killed.\n\nAuthorities reopened the Faria case after investigating the 2016 murder of 33-year-old Louis Gumpenberger, who was mentally and physically impaired from a car accident. Police say Hupp told them Gumpenberger approached her in her driveway, pulled a knife, and demanded that she take him to the bank. She said she ran away from him and shot him inside her house when he followed her. Police found $900 in Gumpenberger\u2019s pocket alongside a note with instructions to kidnap Hupp and collect the Faria insurance money \u2014 items Hupp had planted to make it look like Russ Faria had ordered her assassination.\n\nAnother woman told police that days before Gumpenberger was killed, she was approached by someone matching Hupp\u2019s description who claimed to be a Dateline producer and offered her $1,000 to record a scripted sound bite about 9-1-1 calls. Because the person wouldn\u2019t show credentials, she refused.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, it appears that this woman has been plotting and planning and blaming everyone else for the crimes that she has committed,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern and we keep seeing that pattern, even now that we\u2019re talking to new witnesses who have known her over the years and discovered the deceptions and frauds that she employed. But the spine of the story is, Who killed Betsy Faria? And I think we know the answer.\u201d\n\nMorrison and Dateline producers worked alongside the podcast\u2019s producers to revisit the meandering story, which allowed the podcast to \u201cget some of that insider feeling and information you can\u2019t really put in a television program,\u201d said Dateline\u2019s senior executive producer David Corvo.\n\n\u201cPodcasts are one of the hot platforms out there and we perceive our brand to be broader than just broadcast television. We felt like we have ownership of part of the true-crime space and we want to extend it everywhere we can.\u201d\n\nFans of Morrison\u2019s distinct TV storytelling style and cadence \u2014 his dread-filled warnings and ominous details \u2014 will not be disappointed by his foray into podcasting. Though it\u2019s a new experience for the audience to hear him only, he didn\u2019t set out to sound different. \u201cI just talk that way,\u201d Morrison said with a laugh. \u201cMy whole life.\u201d\n\n\u201cPodcasts are a really fun new outlet,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of the frustrations of any kind of reporting is you have to leave an awful lot of stuff out. In our case, if we\u2019re doing a two-hour story, we leave out about 90 percent of what we hear. With a podcast, you get a lot more time to spin all that out and live in the details and be more conversational.\u201d\n\nThe Thing About Pam will include new interviews and conversations from interrogation videos that have not been featured on Dateline, but no interview with Hupp herself. \u201cShe has never been available to us but, boy oh boy, would I love to,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI would love nothing more than to sit down with the lovely Pam and ask her a question or two.\u201d\n\nA new episode covering the Pamela Hupp case will air during the new season of Dateline NBC, which premieres September 27. Future podcasts about other cases could feature other Dateline NBC correspondents as narrators, Cole said.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling we\u2019ll be doing more, but this one is a good one to start out with because it\u2019s a remarkable, jaw-dropping tale perfectly suited for that kind of storytelling,\u201d Morrison said.", "description": "The Thing About Pam, a new podcast hosted by Dateline\u2019s Keith Morrison, investigates the twists and turns behind a pair of brutal Missouri murders tied to a woman named Pam Hupp.", "authors": ["Maria Elena Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-dateline-podcast.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
