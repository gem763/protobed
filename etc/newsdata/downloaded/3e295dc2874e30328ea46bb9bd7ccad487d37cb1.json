Hours earlier, the tanker had begun transmitting its location for the first time in weeks just outside the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, where it had been held since its seizure.\n\nErik Hanell, president and CEO of Swedish-based Stena Bulk, the ship\u2019s owner, said the vessel and its crew had been released, and the ship would be transiting through Dubai for the crew to disembark and receive medical checks.\n\n\u201cThe families of crew members have been informed and the company is currently making arrangements for the repatriation of its valued seafarers at the earliest possible opportunity,\u201d Hanell said in a statement.\n\nThe ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com showed the Stena Impero heading south from Iran at a speed of just over 14 mph (22 kph).\n\nIran seized the tanker on July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil passes. The raid saw commandos rappel down onto the vessel via helicopter carrying assault rifles, dramatic images later replayed on state television.\n\nThe seizure came after British marines helped take control of an Iranian supertanker on July 4. Authorities in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, seized the ship carrying $130 million in crude oil on suspicion it was breaking European Union sanctions by taking the oil to Syria. Gibraltar later released the tanker, then called the Grace 1, after it said Iran promised the ship wouldn\u2019t go to Syria.\n\nThat ship, renamed the Adrian Darya 1, later sat off the Syrian coast, angering Britain. Iran hasn\u2019t said who purchased its 2.1 million barrels of crude oil.\n\nOn Monday, Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei had told journalists the Stena Impero could leave.\n\n\u201cBased on a friendly approach that allows forgiving mistakes, ground for freedom of the tanker has been paved and it can move,\u201d Rabiei said. But the ship remained outside Bandar Abbas until Friday.\n\nEarlier this month, Iran released seven crew members of the Stena Impero. Sixteen remained on board.\n\nThe ship seizures come after months of heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf, sparked by President Trump\u2019s decision over a year ago to unilaterally pull out of a nuclear deal with Iran. The U.S. has imposed sanctions that have kept Iran from selling its oil abroad and have crippled its economy. Iran has since begun breaking terms of the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been a series of attacks across the Middle East that the U.S. blames on Iran. They reached their height on Sept. 14, with a missile and drone attack on the world\u2019s largest oil processor in Saudi Arabia and an oil field, which caused oil prices to spike by the biggest percentage since the 1991 Gulf War. While Yemen\u2019s Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia says it was \u201cunquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d\n\nIran denies being responsible and has warned any retaliatory attack targeting it will result in an \u201call-out war.\u201d\n\n____\n\nJon Gambrell and Elena Becatoros in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Jan M.
