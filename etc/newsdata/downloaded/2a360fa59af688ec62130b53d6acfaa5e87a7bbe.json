Whitaker, the Trump administration\u2019s former acting attorney general, said Tuesday that \u201cabuse of power is not a crime\u201d warranting of impeachment.\n\nWhile appearing on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d Mr. Whitaker said the Democrats\u2019 handling of President Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry is \u201cnot good for the Republic.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, these global elitists, these careerists have made promises and have set in place a world establishment that operated a certain way, and President Trump has asks questions like \u2018Why do we do this this way?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Whitaker said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a former prosecutor and what I know is this is a perfect time for preliminary hearings, where you would say \u2018Show us your evidence. What evidence of a crime do you have?\u2019 Abuse of power is not a crime. Let\u2019s fundamentally boil it down, the Constitution is very clear that there has to be some pretty egregious behavior and they cannot tell the American people what this case is even about.\u201d\n\nThe impeachment clause of the president requires \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d to warrant the rejection of a president.\n\nThe Federalist Papers No. 65 elaborated that \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d can include \u201cabuse or violation of some public trust,\u201d including for \u201cpolitical\u201d crimes.\n\n\u201cThe subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
