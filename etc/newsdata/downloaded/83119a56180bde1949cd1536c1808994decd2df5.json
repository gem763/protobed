This is the question being asked across the art world about the Salvator Mundi - the first Leonardo to be discovered for more than a century - as the Louvre prepares for its blockbuster da Vinci exhibition.\n\nWith just under two weeks to go before the show opens, there are now serious doubts as to whether the star of the exhibition will be included, as the Paris museum had hoped.\n\nThe world\u2019s most expensive painting, a depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress, which sold at auction in 2017 for $450m, would draw huge crowds. Described as a devotional counterpart to the Mona Lisa, Leonardo\u2019s most famous work, it is said to have an \u201cextraordinary, communicative presence\u201d.\n\nBut the arts world is awash with rumours that its appearance looks unlikely. The Art Newspaper goes further and claims the painting will not feature. A spokeswoman for the Louvre told the Observer: \u201cI confirm the Louvre has asked for the loan of the Salvator Mundi. We don\u2019t have the answer yet and thus, don\u2019t have any further comment.\u201d\n\nA no show would be the latest twist in the extraordinary saga of a painting that has attracted as much controversy, intrigue and division as it has critical acclaim. Questions over its authenticity have raged among art historians for more than a decade.\n\nOnce attributed to the \u201cschool of Giovanni Boltraffio\u201d, an early Renaissance painter who was a pupil of Leonardo, it was then upgraded to \u201ca work by Boltraffio\u201d when sold for \u00a345 in 1958 at an auction in London.\n\nA New York art historian and dealer, Robert B Simon, bought it from a New Orleans auction house for just $1,175 in 2005 and it was attributed to Leonardo in 2011.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Louvre\u2019s blockbuster Leonardo exhibition opens at the end of October. Photograph: Bruce Beck/Alamy\n\n\u201cThere are a host of reasons why I believe 100% in Leonardo\u2019s authorship of the Salvator Mundi \u2013 most of all the inimitable style, unique iconography and phenomenal quality of the painting,\u201d Simon told the Observer. \u201cTo these one could add the peculiarities of Leonardo\u2019s technique, the relationship of the painting to autograph drawings, and the evidence of the work\u2019s history. However, for me the most compelling reason to believe in the painting is neither scholarly nor scientific: it comes from its sense of profound spirituality that is conveyed from artist to viewer across 500 years.\u201d\n\nToday, though, some still question the attribution although not, according to Simon, the Louvre. \u201cI know that the painting was requested for the Louvre exhibition \u2013 and as a work by Leonardo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut obviously the decision about whether to loan it is the owner\u2019s to make. And I have no knowledge of his decision.\u201d\n\nIndeed, who actually owns the painting is another source of contention. It was rumoured to be in the hands of the Abu Dhabi royal family. More recently there has been speculation that it is on the super-yacht of Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince who has been forced to deny his involvement in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nThe painting\u2019s previous known owner was Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev who bought it on 3 May 2013 for $127.5m, following substantial restoration. Rybolovlev was later incensed to learn that his art adviser, a Swiss businessman, Yves Bouvier, had allegedly acquired the painting on 2 May 2013 from a consortium led by Simon in a private sale brokered by Sotheby\u2019s. Court documents allege Bouvier paid Sotheby\u2019s $83m before flipping the painting to Rybolovlev for a markup of more than 50%.\n\nRybolovlev alleges that Bouvier repeated the same trick with no fewer than 38 art masterworks he acquired, including paintings by Picasso, Gauguin, Klimt, Rothko and Modigliani. In a lawsuit launched against Sotheby\u2019s for its part in what he alleges was \u201cthe largest art fraud in history\u201d, Rybolovlev claims he was defrauded of more than $1bn.\n\nSotheby\u2019s, which did not return requests for comment, contests the claims, as does Bouvier.\n\nThe extraordinary alacrity with which the painting\u2019s value sky-rocketed, and the opaque circumstances surrounding its sale and ownership, have prompted calls for the art market to be more heavily regulated.\n\nBut Simon, who this week publishes a new book he has co-authored about the painting \u2013 Leonardo\u2019s Salvator Mundi and the Collecting of Leonardo in the Stuart Courts \u2013 which examines evidence that its previous owners included English royalty, expressed scepticism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how any art market regulation would have a bearing on the controversy surrounding the sale of the work. The sale of a valuable work of art like the Leonardo is governed by existing laws similar to and often the same as those that concern other valuable properties \u2013 whether art, gold, jewellery, land, a building, yacht, or an airplane.\u201c\n\nThe Salvator Mundi was due to appear at the Louvre museum in Abu Dhabi last year. Then, as now, its no show invited speculation as to where it was really hanging. It could be that the most expensive painting in history \u2013 and arguably the most controversial \u2013 is not on display anywhere.\n\n\u201cI do not know where the painting is,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAlthough I had heard that some months ago it was being kept in a secure art storage facility in Switzerland.\u201d", "description": "The Louvre has asked to loan Salvator Mundi for a major exhibition \u2013 but many doubt the much-disputed work will make an appearance", "authors": ["Jamie Doward"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38229f3b5fbdf7cb040e85ac5ca811762960115/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec3bfec9eca01b1034c101f0e37b3398", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
