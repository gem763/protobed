However, industry insiders and enthusiastic customers alike routinely say what separates the top tier of hosts from their lesser colleagues isn\u2019t their physical attractiveness.\n\nInstead, successful hosts are the ones who can make a lady feel special. Through some mix of suave sophistication, roguish charm, and/or sensitive emotional attentiveness, they have personalities that make women enjoy spending time around them. Well, more accurately, they\u2019re able to project a persona that women enjoy being around, but one woman found out, in a violent way, that a host she\u2019d been cozying up to wasn\u2019t as nice as he\u2019d seemed.\n\nOn Oct 17, 23-year-old host Hiro Kawakami was out in Tokyo\u2019s Kabukicho bar district with a younger coworker host and two women they\u2019d met when they\u2019d come to their club as customers. While the two hosts weren\u2019t officially working at the time the group of four was out, pseudo-socializing with customers outside of the club they\u2019re employed at (on the customers\u2019 dime, of course) is a fairly common, and often encouraged, practice in the host/hostess industry in Japan.\n\nThe group booked a private karaoke box and began singing, but apparently one of the women didn\u2019t care for Kawakami\u2019s musical stylings, and began making fun of him for his off-key vocal performance, calling him \u201ctone-deaf.\u201d Kawakami and the woman then got into a verbal confrontation, prompting the other woman, aged 25, to step in and try to intervene. Having had his vocal cords mocked, Kawakami then decided to show off what he could do with his cranium, headbutting the second woman and otherwise striking her, fracturing her orbital floor (essentially the bone at the back of the eye socket).\n\nKawakami was subsequently arrested and taken into custody by police. During questioning, he admitted to the charges, saying \u201c[The woman] was making fun of me by saying I sucked at singing, and it pissed me off.\u201d Meanwhile, the woman\u2019s injury is expected to take approximately one month to heal.\n\nSources: Nitele News 24 via Livedoor News via Jin, FNN Prime\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Combination host club/bookstore proposed for Tokyo\u2019s liveliest nightlife neighborhood\n\n-- What happens when a single woman joins a Japanese host club bus tour around Tokyo?\n\n-- Tokyo host club opens its doors to female cosplayers for special photo shoot event\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/24/tokyo-host-club-hosts-headbutts-woman-after-being-told-he-sucks-at-karaoke/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "It\u2019s an absolute requirement, obviously, that the staff of Japan\u2019s host bars be handsome.
