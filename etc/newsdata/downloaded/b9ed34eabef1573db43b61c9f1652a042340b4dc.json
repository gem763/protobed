PRECIOUS-Gold dips on strong dollar and optimism over trade deal\n\n* Silver hits lowest since Aug. 20 at $16.85\n\n* SPDR Gold holdings fell 0.2% on Monday\n\n* Palladium slips after breaching $1,700\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Brijesh Patel\n\nOct 1 (Reuters) - Gold slid to its lowest in nearly two\n\nmonths as the dollar climbed to a multi-year peak on signs of\n\nstrength in the U.S. economy while hopes of a breakthrough in\n\nthe U.S.-China trade dispute dampened interest in the metal as a\n\nhaven from risk.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.3% at $1,467.29 per ounce at\n\n1145 GMT on Tuesday after touching its lowest since Aug. 6 at\n\n$1,458.50. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were steady at $1,474.40.\n\n\"There seem to be some headlines people are reading\n\npositively on the trade front, which is also supporting the\n\ndollar, so that's naturally weighing on the gold market,\" said\n\nOANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam.\n\n\"Price action seen over the past week made the $1,480\n\nsupport level very vulnerable. Gold broke that level yesterday\n\nand it's capitalising on those moves to push further down. There\n\nis room for plenty more declines over the next few weeks.\"\n\nThe dollar held firm on Tuesday after posting its biggest\n\nquarterly gain in more than a year, with encouraging U.S.\n\neconomic data leading markets to scale back expectations that\n\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming\n\nmonths. FRX/\n\nThat has weighed on gold because lower interest rates cut\n\nthe opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\n\n\"(A) less accommodative Fed implies a stronger U.S. dollar\n\nand higher U.S. yields, which are the absolute worst bedfellows\n\nfor gold markets,\" AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes\n\nsaid in a note.\n\nBullion has lost nearly $100 since scaling a peak of $1,557\n\nearly September, largely owing to an uptick in the dollar.\n\nIt is still up 14% this year, with earlier gains driven by\n\nan escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict, concerns over\n\nglobal economic growth and the prospects for monetary easing by\n\ncentral banks.\n\nMore positive signs on trade have weighed on the metal of\n\nlate. The White House dismissed reports that the Trump\n\nadministration was considering delisting Chinese companies from\n\nU.S. stock exchanges as \"fake news\", bolstering risk sentiment.\n\nMKTS/GLOB\n\nChina and the United States are due to resume high-level\n\ntrade talks in Washington next week.\n\nIndicative of investor sentiment, holdings at SPDR Gold\n\nTrust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded\n\nfund, fell 0.2% to 920.83 tonnes on Monday. Elsewhere, palladium XPD= fell 0.7% to $1,662.73 an ounce,\n\nhaving hit a record high of $1,700.71 on Monday on a sustained\n\nsupply deficit of the autocatalyst metal.\n\nPlatinum XPT= rose 0.3% to $884.94 and silver\n\ngained 0.7% to $17.11 after touching its lowest since Aug. 20 at\n\n$16.85.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold dips on strong dollar and optimism over trade deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6R05F_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
