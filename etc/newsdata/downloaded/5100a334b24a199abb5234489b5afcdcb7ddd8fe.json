He was very upset and very low. We were very concerned.\n\n\u201cWe started asking \u2018how did this happen\u2019. We were so upset.\u201d\n\nSomali-born Jamal was assaulted on either August 30 or 31, 2016, after prison guards found contraband in his cell, his family said.\n\nThey believe the father-of-one, from Hulme, who was a Muslim, had been pressured into keeping contraband alcohol, known as hooch, in his cell for other prisoners.\n\nLawyers acting for the family said the 32-year-old had refused to report the assault to officers, Manchester Evening News reports.\n\nHis family said on Friday September 2, 2016 they received a call from a prison staff member to assure them that Jamal was okay.\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News WS)\n\nAround two hours later, they said they were told he had been rushed to hospital.\n\nPrison officials say they were informed by the family that Jamal was being bullied only \"15 minutes before\" he was found hanging in his cell.\n\nHe fell into a coma and was rushed to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where he died 11 days later.\n\nAn inquest into his death last week found he died as a result of misadventure.\n\nJamal's family said he had planned to visit his wife and 10-year-old daughter in Somalia before he was jailed.\n\nHis sister said Jamal's daughter has suffered the most after his death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been very awful for his daughter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe was planning to visit her. She just can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s lost her dad.\n\n\u201cOne day she is waiting to see him and the next thing she\u2019s told her dad is not going to make it.\u201d\n\nJamal had ambitions to work in the construction industry and was hoping to move his wife and daughter to Manchester.\n\nA keen footballer, he had previously done volunteer work, but suffered with his mental health, his sister said.\n\n\u201cHe was a very kind person, very friendly and well known in Hulme and Moss Side,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe made friends very easily.\n\n\u201cHe was a very lovely person and smiley. He was helpful at home and if someone was sick he would always be there to support them. We feel really empty at home without him.\u201d\n\nJamal appeared at Minshull Street Crown Court on August 15, 2016.\n\nProsecutors alleged he used a paving stone to break down a front window of his father\u2019s home on Criccieth Street, Moss Side, at 3.30am on Tuesday, July 12.\n\nHe was said to have used a broom handle to hit his father on the arm, wrist, back and head.\n\nThe victim was taken to hospital for treatment for cuts, bruises and swelling.\n\nJamal was remanded into custody at HMP Manchester in July 2016.\n\nA Prison and Probation Ombudsman report, published this week, found that there were a number of \"missed opportunities\" to help Jamal following the alleged assault.\n\nHe had a history of self-harm, by cutting, but a community psychiatric nurse (CPN) who assessed did not identify any immediate concerns or an increase in his risk.\n\nThe report states that prison officers found \"two containers of homemade alcohol\" in Jamal's cell on August 28 and he also handed over an \"improvised bladed weapon\".\n\nJamal denied the items were his but refused to tell guards who they belonged to, the PPO report states.\n\n\"He did not tell staff he was being bullied,\" it adds.\n\n\"However, on September 1, a prisoner told an officer that another prisoner had assaulted Mr Hussein because staff had discovered the contraband items in his cell.\n\n\"The officer did not speak to Mr Hussein, or record this information in prison records.\"\n\nHe later told a community support worker he had been \"punched\" but did not give more details.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nOmbudsman Nigel Newcomen CBE found that \"staff failed to give sufficient weight to Mr Hussein\u2019s level of risk when he arrived at Manchester on July 14 and, in the circumstances, we believe staff should have fully considered starting ACCT procedures.\"\n\n\"While Mr Hussein gave no direct indication to staff or other prisoners that he had thoughts of suicide or self-harm, staff were too reliant on his presentation in making an assessment,\" the report added.\n\nHe added that Jamal \"did not receive the support from staff he could have expected\" as he was never allocated a personal officer and there were several \"missed opportunities\" to help him following the alleged assault.\n\nMr Newcomen reports: \"His family raised their concerns about bullying through various channels.\n\n\"Another prisoner made an officer aware that Mr Hussein had been bullied the day before he was discovered hanged in his cell.\n\n\"On the day Mr Hussein was found, the officer spoke to him and despite seeing a bruise on his face did not investigate further or begin violence reduction measures.\n\n\"The CPN also spoke to Mr Hussein a few hours before he was discovered and, although he told her that somebody had punched him in the face, she did not inform prison staff.\"\n\nFamily members say they had begged for Jamal to be moved out of the prison, commonly referred to as Strangeways.\n\nIn a statement released after the inquest they said: \u201cAs a family we still miss him dearly and we still grieve for his loss.\n\n\u201cHowever, his young daughter is most impacted by his death as she is very far away from the rest of the family.\u201d\n\nTheir solicitor Kelly Darlington, of Farley\u2019s, described Jamal as \"vulnerable\" and said he was struggling with his mental health.\n\n\u201cIt is nearly three years since Jamal's death and the family fought at every stage of the inquest process to find out the answers to the many questions they had surrounding Jamal\u2019s death,\" she added.\n\n\"It is hoped that now the inquest has concluded, they can grieve for him properly.\u201d\n\nThe Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is investigating the case and a report into Jamal\u2019s death is expected to be published soon.\n\nA Prison Service spokeswoman said: \u201cIt is a tragedy whenever anyone takes their own life in prison and our thoughts remain with Jamal\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThe coroner found the prison was not negligent in its care but also recognised that, nonetheless, there have been significant improvements to how vulnerable prisoners are supported at HMP Manchester in the three years since Jamal\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nIf you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org", "description": "Jamal Hussein, 32, was planning to visit his wife and 10-year-old daughter in Somalia before he was jailed at HMP Manchester", "authors": ["Beth Abbit", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Men Media", "Manchester Evening News Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580983.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jamal-Hussein.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
