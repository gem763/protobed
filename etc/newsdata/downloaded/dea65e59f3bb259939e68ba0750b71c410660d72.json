Bush administration, thinks that President Trump deserves to be impeached, but the conservative legal scholar is also critical of how the Democrats are going about the process.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s actions in the Ukraine scandal appear to be \u201cclearly\u201d impeachable and are \u201cprobably the 300th thing Trump has done that\u2019s an impeachable offense,\u201d Goldsmith told Yahoo News in an interview on the \u201cLong Game\u201d podcast. But he also lamented the impact of a few Democratic mistakes, such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s misleading answers on whether he or his staff had been in touch with the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIn the general scheme of things, what Schiff did doesn\u2019t even compare to what the president did,\u201d Goldsmith said.\n\nBut, he said, it nonetheless \u201cwas deeply unfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant because 40-some-odd percent of this country believes that the Democrats and the deep state have been violating norms and skirting norms to try to reverse the election [of 2016],\u201d Goldsmith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the proper characterization, but when the president\u2019s opponents cut corners, don\u2019t tell the truth, seem like they\u2019re in league with bureaucrats to try to bring down the president, it just fosters that narrative and I think it\u2019s a very destructive narrative.\u201d\n\nSchiff told MSNBC on Sept. 17 that neither he nor his staff had \u201cspoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d But in fact, the whistleblower had spoken with Intelligence Committee staffers prior to filing his or her official complaint on Aug. 12 about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a New York Times report.\n\nThat means that for the entire August recess, Schiff had some knowledge of the existence and contents of the whistleblower complaint, which stated that Trump had pressured Zelensky to have his government investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOn Sept. 9 \u2014 more than a week before the whistleblower complaint exploded into the news cycle on Sept. 19 \u2014 Schiff, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel sent a pair of letters to the White House and the State Department indicating some level of knowledge about the allegations that would be leveled by the whistleblower.\n\n\u201cA growing public record indicates that, for nearly two years, the President and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, appear to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity,\u201d Schiff, Cummings and Engel wrote in their letters.\n\n\u201cIf the President is trying to pressure Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of power, a boon to Moscow, and a betrayal of the public trust,\u201d the letters said.\n\nPresident Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the U.N.

But as always, the president is mostly to blame, I think.\u201d", "description": "Jack Goldsmith, who worked in the Justice Department under George W.
