Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost.\n\nImagine flying almost halfway across the world and back \u2013 for dinner. Blake Shinn is jetting into Melbourne from Hong Kong, not wanting to let anyone down. Humidor first emergency for Cox Plate. Shinn will have dinner with connections Friday night, fly back Saturday morning if doesn\u2019t get a start \u2013 @bendorries76\n\nIt is the premier time of year for horse racing in Australia, but you would barely know if you lived in Hong Kong.\n\nLast weekend, the time-honoured Caulfield Cup was held in Melbourne and the world\u2019s richest turf race, The Everest, was conducted in Sydney.\n\nOn Saturday, the Cox Plate is on, followed by the four-day Melbourne Cup carnival.\n\nThey are race meetings that command global attention \u2013 internationals have travelled from Europe and Japan to compete in them \u2013 but they don\u2019t get much of a look in here.\n\nThe Jockey Club simulcast a token two races from Caulfield Cup day (but six from the Champions Day meeting at Ascot later that evening) and it is set to cover another five from the Melbourne Cup card. That\u2019s it.\n\nLast season, the Jockey Club broadcast and held markets on 34 meetings around the world but just three were from Australia.\n\nJapan led the way with 11, there were eight from Britain (including all five days of Royal Ascot), four from France, three from Dubai, two from Singapore, one each from Macau, Korea and South Africa.\n\nThis is disproportionate for the quality and standing of these races in comparison to the simulcasts shown from other countries, particularly given Hong Kong\u2019s close relationship/reliance on Australia.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s horse population is dominated by Australian horses \u2013 at last count 687 come from Down Under \u2013 which is more than half of the 1,362 currently on the books. The past four Hong Kong Derby winners were bought after racing in Australia (as was Beauty Generation) \u2013 owners pay serious attention to these events when looking for the next big thing.\n\nThe jockey and training ranks (not to mention staff and administrators) are also stocked with Aussies, while now with the quarantine restrictions being eased (but not been fully resolved), there will be horses flying the navy, white and red (or green and gold if that\u2019s your preference) flag at Sha Tin\u2019s two international meetings.\n\nThe races are relevant to Hong Kong punters while Sha Tin-based jockeys regularly make the trip to ride at these major meetings (they go to Australia more than any other jurisdiction).\n\nSo why aren\u2019t more shown?\n\nSome of the key issues for the Jockey Club are (in no particular order): can Hong Kong horses compete in these races? Are they in the world\u2019s top 100 races? Is there a relevance to the Hong Kong market? Does the timing work (that\u2019s why the Breeders\u2019 Cup isn\u2019t shown)? Do they drive turnover?\n\nThe quarantine issue is a good place to begin as that instigated the initial cut.\n\nBefore the start of the 2017-18 season, the Jockey Club had scheduled eight simulcasts from Oz \u2013 but two were dropped (the Doncaster Mile and Queen Elizabeth Stakes meetings) after it came to light the Australian government had an issue with the addition of Conghua (in mainland China) to Hong Kong\u2019s equine biosphere and stopped the direct importation of horses to Australia.\n\nAs a result, it was no surprise the number of Australian simulcasts was cut to three last term \u2013 just the Cox Plate, Melbourne Cup and Queen Elizabeth Stakes cards were shown \u2013 and the two bookends only got the green light because the mighty mare Winx was involved.\n\nThe reason given for the change was the fact Hong Kong horses weren\u2019t able to compete in any of these races due to the ongoing quarantine situation.\n\nThe Jockey Club wouldn\u2019t admit it publicly, but it also uses these simulcasts as leverage in negotiations with other racing bodies.\n\nWhy? Because there is a significant financial windfall for the host clubs involved \u2013 they get a percentage of the money invested by Hong Kong punters for basically nothing.\n\nThe situation is also amplified by egos \u2013 there is no shortage of them in either Australia or Hong Kong \u2013 and sometimes they don\u2019t work in harmony to help each other.\n\nBut while that is subjective, turnover is not and the numbers from Australia don\u2019t compare as favourably to some other countries.\n\n\u201cJapan ranks extremely high, then it comes Great Britain. Then Australia is not as popular in relation to turnover,\u201d Jockey Club chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges told the Post in July.\n\nThat is true, but there are also mitigating circumstances, with timing being the most pertinent.\n\nJapanese features happen on a Sunday (often single races during a Sha Tin meeting) when \u201c15 to 20 per cent more\u201d betting accounts are active than on a Saturday. Punters also wager more at night than in the morning, which favours British races.\n\nNext month, Sha Tin will host two Saturday meetings \u2013 a rarity \u2013 to allow two big international simulcasts the following day \u2013 the Singapore Gold Cup and Japan Cup cards. A significant leg-up for those jurisdictions.\n\nWhile turnover is important, it can\u2019t be everything.\n\nThere has to be a balance and one of the focus points should be broadcasting world-class racing.\n\nThere are only two Australian simulcasts in the first half of the term and, going off last season, there will only be one to come. That\u2019s not enough \u2013 there is no way France should have more.\n\nThe quarantine issue should be resolved soon, so that will no longer be an excuse and hopefully there can be a recalibration.\n\nThe Cox Plate was rated the equal seventh-best race in the world last year, nine of the 14 runners hold entries to the Hong Kong International Races and Shinn is booked to ride the first emergency. It should be simulcast.\n\nThe current ratio is out of whack and it is doing Hong Kong\u2019s racing fans a disservice. It\u2019s time to fix it.", "description": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing. Have something to say?
