Larry Hogan (R), who chairs the state\u2019s Board of Public Works, had faced criticism from lawmakers over his initial refusal to issue payments to five exonerated men. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan has launched a process to pay what could be millions of dollars to five wrongly convicted men who collectively spent 120 years in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.\n\nThe men have sought compensation over the past 19 months from the state Board of Public Works, which is authorized to issue such payments but has not done so since 2004.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Hogan (R), who chairs the board, rejected calls by a group of mostly Democratic lawmakers for the panel to act on the petitions. He said the three-member panel, which includes the comptroller and state treasurer, does not have the expertise to determine the amounts of payments.\n\nHogan said Wednesday that he has instructed David Bohannon, the board\u2019s general counsel, to prepare a memorandum of understanding with Thomas Dewberry, the state\u2019s chief administrative law judge, to \u201cimmediately\u201d put in place a procedure to compensate Lamar Johnson, Jerome Johnson, Walter Lomax, Clarence Shipley Jr. and Hubert James Williams.\n\nThe governor again faulted the Democratic-majority legislature for failing to pass bills that would have created specific rules for compensating exonerees.\n\n\u201cThese individuals should not have to wait for the legislature to finally act,\u201d Hogan said at a meeting of the Board of Public Works. \u201cThere is no question that they deserve to be compensated.\u201d\n\nHogan said he will \u201cpush hard\u201d for lawmakers to pass a bill that provides guidelines for compensating exonerees in the future.\n\nDel. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), who sponsored past bills on the topic and plans to do so again, lashed out at Hogan for attacking the legislature, noting that Hogan and the board can award money to exonerees under current law but have chosen not to.\n\nHogan's \"launch\" is unnecessary and just political smoke. There's a process in place. Hogan & BPW just have to follow it. 2019 legislation to clarify and strengthen the process failed in the Senate. But, Hogan can process compensation NOW! \u2014 Delegate Dumais, Vice Chair Economic Matters (@KathleenDumais1) September 18, 2019\n\nMaryland lags far behind others in compensating those who were wrongly imprisoned, experts say. Nearly three dozen former felons have been exonerated in the state over the past 30 years. But only nine of them have sought payment \u2014 and just three received money during that time.\n\nEarlier this month, about 50 lawmakers, including House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County), urged the Board of Public Works to act on the exonerees\u2019 petitions. In July, attorneys for the men sent a joint letter to the Board of Public Works asking for $100,000 a year for each year of incarceration, totaling $12 million.\n\nState Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) said Wednesday that it was time to compensate the \u201cillegally incarcerated\u201d men.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we will come up with something that is fair and compassionate and timely,\u201d he said. \u201cTime is of the essence here.\u201d\n\nTreasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D) had previously said the board should act.\n\n\n\nFour of the exonerated men, clockwise from top left: Walter Lomax, Hubert James Williams, Lamar Johnson and Clarence Shipley. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nAttorneys for the exonerees, who have been in discussions with Board of Public Works staff in recent weeks, said they were encouraged by Hogan\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cCompensation or remuneration from the state will be a recognition of the pain and suffering that my clients and other exonerees have endured,\u201d said Neel Lalchandani, who represents Shipley and Jerome Johnson.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an affirmation from the state of Maryland that the lives of exonerees matter, and that the time they lost matters as well. We welcome this development, but we now want to get to the finish line on this.\u201d\n\nBohannon said he has reached out to Dewberry\u2019s office to come up with an agreement that will allow administrative law judges, who typically adjudicate claims involving state agencies, to hold hearings on the individual cases and recommend an amount to be awarded.\n\nThe Board of Public Works would have to approve a memorandum of understanding outlining that process, and vote on the administrative law judges\u2019 recommendations for each of the men.\n\nThirty-five states have passed legislation authorizing exonerees to be compensated for their time served. The majority of them, including Florida, New Jersey and California, provide at least $50,000 for each year of incarceration, according to the Innocence Project.\n\nMichelle Feldman, state campaigns director for the Innocence Project, said 22 of the 35 states settle claims through a state or local court system.\n\nMaryland\u2019s statute does not suggest a dollar figure but authorizes the Board of Public Works to award a sum \u201ccommensurate with the actual damages sustained as a result of the confinement.\u201d\n\nLalchandani said he wants the process to be \u201csimple and fast. . . This cannot be a drawn-out process. These men have waited long enough.\u201d\n\nAndrew George, an attorney who represents Williams, said he does not oppose the use of administrative law judges but hopes the process moves quickly.\n\nGeorge said Williams, who is homeless, is \u201cbadly in need of physical and mental health care.\u201d Last week he asked the board to pay $35,000 for temporary housing for Williams until his petition is resolved. He said he has not received a response to the request.\n\nRead more:\n\nMaryland has lagged far behind other states in compensating exonerees\n\nMd. board split over how to compensate wrongly imprisoned men\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The men were jailed for 120 years and seek $12 million.
