When people perform well (academically or otherwise) at early ages and are labeled smart or gifted, they become less likely to challenge themselves. They become less likely to make mistakes, because they stay in their comfortable comfort zone and stop growing. And their fixed mindset persists through adulthood. The simple and innocent praising of a smart kid feeds an insidious problem that some researchers track all the way up to gender inequality in STEM careers.\n\nSo ending the reign of the S word, as Boaler calls it, is a grand mission. \u201cIt's imperative that we don\u2019t praise kids by telling them they\u2019re smart,\u201d she argued in a Monday lecture to an audience that received her message with many knowing nods. \u201cYou can tell kids that they\u2019ve done something fantastic, but don\u2019t label them as smart.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a fixed mindset, in which people are smart or not smart, stands in contrast to a growth mindset, in which people become intelligent and knowledgeable through practice. In her 2006 book The New Psychology of Success, psychologist Carol Dweck described the two: People with growth mindsets believe that the harder they work, the smarter they get. And the subtleties of the ways in which we praise kids are related to the mindsets those kids develop.\n\nThe group most damaged by fixed-mindset thinking is high-achieving girls, Boaler argues, because it\u2019s girls who are told by society that they probably won\u2019t be as good as boys at math and science. That means girls are only more likely to avoid challenging themselves in science and math, and that aversion to making mistakes leads to less learning and progress. The more that certain disciplines cling to ideas of giftedness, the fewer female Ph.D.s there are in those fields.\n\n\u201cWhen we give kids the message that mistakes are good, that successful people make mistakes, it can change their entire trajectory,\u201d Boaler said. 100 percent is not an ideal score. When kids come home from school and announce that they got everything right on their school work, Dweck advises parents to offer some sympathy: Oh, I\u2019m sorry you didn't get the chance to learn.\n\nSpeaking of percentages, math is a good example of the importance of avoiding the fixed mindset. The idea of a \u201cmath person\u201d or a math gene is a primary reason for so much math nihilism, math failure, and \u201cmath trauma,\u201d as Boaler called it on Monday. When kids get the idea that they \u201caren\u2019t math people,\u201d they start a downward trajectory, and their career options shrink immediately and substantially. There is also the common idea of a wall in math: People learn math until they hit a wall where they just can\u2019t keep up. That wall may be trigonometry, and it may be advanced calculus, and it may be calculating a tip. In no other discipline but math are people so given to thinking, instead of I need to practice, just Well, I\u2019m not good.\n\n\u201cBig news,\u201d Boaler said during her lecture, \u201cthere is no wall.\u201d\n\nWith that, she advanced her Powerpoint and to a slide bearing a rendering of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know who this was,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of my teammates made this slide. I\u2019ve learned that this is Kool-Aid Man.\u201d", "description": "People labeled \u201csmart\u201d at a young age don\u2019t deal well with being wrong.
