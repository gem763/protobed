Add Mike Pence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Mike Pence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cOne of the major reasons we were elected was to drain the swamp,\u201d Pence told reporters at an event in Scottsdale, Arizona. \u201cI think the American people have the right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is about looking backwards and understanding what really happened,\u201d Pence continued. \u201cI mean, the fact that my predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board, at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration's efforts in Ukraine, I think that's worth looking into.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona Republic via USA Today Network\n\nPence emphasized that Trump \u201cmade it very clear\u201d that other nations around the world, in addition to Ukraine, should also look into the Biden family\u2019s business dealings.\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is, when you hold the second highest office in the land, it comes with unique responsibilities,\u201d Pence observed. \u201cThere are legitimate questions that ought to be an asked. We will continue to ask them because the American people have a right to know whether or not the Vice President of United States or his family profited from his position.\u201d\n\nThe president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have charged that Hunter Biden benefited financially in Ukraine and China with the help of his father and that the former vice president had sought to remove Ukraine's top prosecutor because he was looking into the energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board. That prosecutor, however, was already facing widespread criticism from the international community for failing to more aggressively crack down on corruption.\n\nJoe Biden has rejected the accusations.\n\nPetr David Josek/AP\n\nPence's press secretary Katie Waldman blasted a Washington Post report, attributed to former officials, that said Trump used Pence to pressure Ukraine's president, making military aid contingent on investigating corruption, but that Pence may have been unaware of Trump's push to investigate the Bidens. Waldman called the report a \u201cmasquerading piece of journalism\u201d even as she celebrated the report as \u201ca clear vindication of the Administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the Post\u2019s attempts to glorify a grand conspiracy being concocted by a select number of disgruntled former employees, it is crystal clear that the Vice President directly and effectively delivered the President\u2019s anti-corruption and European burden sharing messages overseas and, upon his return, the financial aid to Ukraine was released,\u201d Waldman noted. \u201cBut these facts don\u2019t fit the Post\u2019s pre-planned, pre-conceived hopes and dreams to curry favor with Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff.\u201d\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe Washington Post also reported a Pence aide listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call during which he pressured Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens, but Waldman would not directly comment on that detail.\n\nOn the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last week, Trump told reporters to look into Pence\u2019s conversations with Ukrainian officials \u201cbecause he had a couple of conversations also.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could save you a lot of time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.\u201d\n\nPence also appeared in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, with the U.S. intelligence official claiming that on or around May 14, Trump instructed Pence to cancel a planned trip to Ukraine to attend the inauguration of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the new Ukrainian president, on May 20. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the president\u2019s delegation instead.\n\nMeanwhile, a Trump administration official insisted that Pence never broached the Bidens with the Ukrainians, although he did discuss corruption more broadly with Zelenskiy during a visit to Warsaw, Poland as well as a follow-up phone call with the Ukrainian president last month.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s July 25 conversation with the Ukraine president has raised allegations from Democrats about the possibility of a quid pro quo \u2013 dangling U.S. military assistance in exchange for an investigation into the Biden family \u2013 Pence attempted to flip the script against the Democratic presidential front-runner.\n\n\u201cYou look at the video of Vice President Biden, and you see there was clearly a quid pro quo,\u201d Pence said Thursday.\u201d He said, if the prosecutor was not fired -- who, among other things, was investigating the company he has a son on the board of -- that he was going to withhold a billion dollars. Contrast that to the president's phone call with President Zelenskiy, where there was no quid pro quo, there was no pressure.\u201d\n\nABC News' Ben Gittleson contributed to this report", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence offered a full-throated defense of President Donald Trump against the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/pence-ariz-usa-ps-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
