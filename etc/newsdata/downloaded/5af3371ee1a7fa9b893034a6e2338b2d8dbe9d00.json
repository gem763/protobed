Screengrabs from Youtube\n\nJP Morgan, the employer of the man filmed verbally abusing a security officer at his Whampoa condominium in a viral video, has reminded its Singapore-based staff to uphold a \u201cculture of respect\u201d in their daily conduct.\n\nIn an internal e-mail memo on Tuesday (Oct 29) seen by The Straits Times, Mr Edmund Lee, the senior country officer of JP Morgan\u2019s Singapore offices, said: \u201cOur people, services and commitment to integrity have made JP Morgan one of the most respected financial institutions in the world. We all have a shared responsibility for preserving and building on this strong reputation.\u201d\n\nHe did not refer to the viral video or explain why he sent the e-mail, choosing only to remind his staff: \u201cAll of us\u2026 are expected to demonstrate the highest standards, including respect and dignity for others\u2026 inside and outside of the workplace.\u201d\n\nMr Lee heads JP Morgan\u2019s operations in Singapore which has about 3,000 employees, including locals and foreigners.\n\nWhen contacted by ST to confirm the e-mail, JP Morgan repeated its statement on Sunday that it is looking into the video and declined to give any detail of the employee.\n\nThe viral incident, which has reignited public debate over the treatment of security personnel here, allegedly took place last Friday night, when the man had some guests over at his Whampoa condominium for Deepavali.\n\nIn the video uploaded to YouTube on the same day, he is seen expressing his displeasure virulently after being told by security officers that he needed to pay parking fees for guests visiting the condo, exclaiming in anger that he had bought his apartment for $1.5 million and that it was not a Housing Board flat.\n\nHe also swore at one officer, who responded: \u201cWe are just enforcing the rules here.\u201d\n\nThe security officer has made a police report.\n\nMeanwhile, the Union of Security Employees and two security agency associations, as well as Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and labour MP Zainal Sapari, have weighed in to speak up for security officers.\n\nMr Zainal also called for the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA), which currently excludes security officers in condominiums and private establishments, to be extended to all security officers \u201cregardless of their work sites\u201d.\n\nIf the law is extended, those found guilty of abusing or insulting condo security officers could then be fined up to $5,000, jailed for up to a year, or both.\n\nSince the video became viral over the weekend, details of the man\u2019s condo unit and mobile phone number, as well as his alleged pay and education history, have been published online as netizens petitioned for JP Morgan to sack him.\n\nThis could run foul of the law as POHA has been amended in April to forbid \u201cdoxxing\u201d \u2013 the publication of identifiable information about a person with the intention to harass, cause violence or fear of violence to a person.\n\nMr Tharman and Security Association Singapore president Raj Joshua Thomas have both urged the public to remain calm and let police investigations take their course.\n\nSaid the Senior Minister in a Facebook post on Sunday: \u201cWe should absolutely avoid threatening or harassing the resident concerned. A police report has been made by the security officer, and we should leave it to the police to handle.\u201d\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - The man was filmed verbally abusing a security officer at his Whampoa condominium in a viral video..
