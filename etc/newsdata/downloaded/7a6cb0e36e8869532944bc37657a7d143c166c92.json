So many superlatives are used to describe it: the world\u2019s greatest show, the most watched tournament, the biggest sporting event.\n\nI needed a big idea that could demonstrate the worldwide reach of football (or soccer, for our U.S. readers) and I wanted to include our global team of busy photographers. For them to find the time to get involved, the idea had to be simple.\n\nI once heard that the rules of football are among the most universally recognised codes in the world. They transcend divides of creed, culture, education, geography and wealth. Offside is offside no matter who you are, or what your nationality. And what is football actually about? It\u2019s about goals.\n\nAnd what is a goal? That moment of ecstatic joy, crushing defeat, a game won, lost or drawn (unless it\u2019s a dull 0-0). Lucky, unlucky, frequently contentious, always an event. Maybe it should have been a goal and was disallowed, maybe it shouldn\u2019t have been but was counted anyway. Goals can signify millions of dollars won or lost or invested in the business of football. They can mean winning or losing a bet.\n\nAnd what is an actual physical goal? FIFA\u2019s rules are strict, but simple: \u201cThe distance between the posts is 7.32 m (8 yds) and the distance from the lower edge of the crossbar to the ground is 2.44 m (8 ft)\u2026 Both goalposts and the crossbar have the same width and depth, which do not exceed 12 cm (5 ins).\u201d\n\nAn idea came to me. Imagine the world viewed through the single constant of a goalpost: the green grass and cloudy skies of Manchester, the dusk in Karachi, a cityscape in Boston, Kathmandu and Tokyo. I checked with a colleague to see that this was not a daft idea. He loved it.\n\nI knew that to get what I was looking for I needed to apply some structure. Experience has told me that photographers, on the whole rightly so, tend to follow their own ideas better than they follow those of others (no disrespect team, but it is as it is).\n\nI set some guidelines: a 24mm lens should be used, the pictures should be shot from the distance of the penalty spot (FIFA rules) and the camera should be at a height of 2 feet, from behind or in front, whatever looked better. My \u201cgoal\u201d was to ensure that the position of the goalposts in the picture frame was a constant. I even shot a picture myself to explain what I wanted. What guide could be simpler to stick to?\n\nSome followed the instructions to the letter, a few ignored some of them, and an elite handful completely made up their own rules. I love the result! I hope you do too.", "description": "The 2014 World Cup starts on June 12 in Brazil and fans around the globe are gearing up for the big tournament.
