(\u201cDionyMed\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201c) (CSE: DYME; OTCQB: DYMEF), a multi-state cannabis brands, direct-to-consumer and distribution platform, previously announced that GLAS USA LLC (\u201cGLAS USA\u201d), as administrative agent, and GLAS America LLC (\u201cGLAS America\u201d), as collateral agent, under the Company\u2019s credit agreement dated January 16, 2019 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) provided the Company with notice of default under the Credit Agreement and demand for immediate payment of the amount of US$24,810,682.80 plus any additional interest, fees and expenses and that GLAS America served the Company with a petition to the Supreme Court of British Columbia seeking the appointment of a receiver over all of the Company\u2019s property and assets (the \u201cReceivership Petition\u201d). The Receivership Petition is scheduled to be heard on October 29, 2019 at 9:45 a.m. P.T. at the Vancouver Supreme Court of British Columbia at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Company, its management team and Board of Directors, working cooperatively with GLAS USA, the Company has been unable to attract a viable transaction to restructure its debts and/or seek a sale of the Company of its assets outside of a court process. GLAS America has therefore advised the Company that it intends to proceed with the Receivership Application and the Company does not intend to oppose the appointment of a receiver. The Company anticipates that FTI Consulting Canada Inc. will be appointed as receiver at the hearing of the Receivership Petition or shortly thereafter.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Company\u2019s four directors, being Susan Watt, David Kerr, Brett Moyer and Stephen Dineley, each independent directors, have advised the Company that they intend to resign effective upon the appointment of the receiver.\n\nAbout DionyMed\n\nFounded in 2017, DionyMed is a multi-state cannabis brands platform, supporting cultivators, manufacturers and award-winning brands in the medical and adult-use cannabis markets.
