Sponsored posts that appear in social media feeds are targeted and calibrated to a certain audience. If it\u2019s a video ad, the best examples are usually short, punchy, and tell a story on mute, luring a viewer in the split-second window before they scroll past. These constraints can also lead to some creative and uncanny forms of advertising. As Stravinsky once wrote, \u201cThe more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one\u2019s self of the chains that shackle the spirit.\u201d Such is the case of Lily\u2019s Garden.\n\nThe most famous ad for Lily\u2019s Garden, told with stiff 3-D animation like a mid-budget kids cartoon, goes something like this: We see Lily, a plucky young woman with thick-rimmed glasses, gazing with excitement at a positive pregnancy test. She clutches it to her chest. In the next shot, she brings the results to her chiseled-jaw boyfriend. Lily tells him the news and he spits out his coffee. In the next shot, he speeds off into the sunset on a scooter, and then we see Lily, sitting on the porch, sobbing into her hands.\n\nIt\u2019s heavy stuff. A devastating tale of love and loss told in just 11 seconds. And then the title appears: the cheery Lily\u2019s Garden logo appears floating over her slumped body. Below appears an enormous button enticing the viewer to \u201cPLAY NOW.\u201d\n\nLily\u2019s Garden is not some cinematic experience, or a Pixar movie taking a surprising dark turn like in the first minutes of Up. It is a match-three mobile game, similar to Candy Crush, developed by the Danish company Tactile Games. The premise is that Lily\u2019s great-aunt Mary has just passed away, tasking Lily with fixing up her property in 30 days in order to inherit the property outright. By completing match-three levels, the player earns resources that they can use to upgrade Lily\u2019s new property and unlock the next part of the serialized story. Like other popular mobile games, it has plenty of free-to-play hooks meant to convince players to spend money. It is also, just going by the ads, relatively daring in terms of subject matter.\n\nWHAT IS THIS FUCKING AD I FOUND ON FACEBOOK pic.twitter.com/CSDXi2Im3F \u2014 messy (@messytweet) August 7, 2019\n\nThe breakup ad went viral last month, for obvious reasons \u2014 it\u2019s a good twist \u2014 but it\u2019s not the only one floating out there. For one thing, there is an extended cut of the ad that goes even further into left field. In this version, a few seconds after Lily\u2019s boyfriend flees, she stops crying and looks up with a smug grin. She wipes away one of the lines on her pregnancy test with her finger, spins the test like a cowboy holstering their pistol, and goes back inside. A box labeled \u201cBlaine\u2019s stuff\u201d flies out the door onto the lawn a second later.\n\nSo, to recap: Lily\u2019s Garden is, apparently, a match-three game about a woman who tricks her deadbeat boyfriend into thinking she\u2019s pregnant, so that he will leave her forever. And I guess there is a garden that factors in somewhere?\n\nCompounding the oddness of this situation is that not only does none of this information have anything to do with the game play, it\u2019s not mentioned in the game at all. It is all contained within targeted ads, and they\u2019re nearly impossible to find outside of that context. You might only encounter this bizarre micro-fiction if you\u2019re lucky enough to be targeted by the algorithms. It\u2019s like the mystery of Lily\u2019s Garden is a secret message that will self-destruct in five seconds. If you\u2019re lucky, you might be gifted with one of the other ads for Lily\u2019s Garden that happen to be floating around cyberspace.\n\nIn another ad, Lily texts Blaine messages of affection, only to then immediately come across him on a romantic lunch date with another woman. In terms of big swings, I think my favorite is the ad in which Lily, through pantomime, conveys the different penis sizes of her two love interests, Blaine and Luke (the accompanying social copy reads, \u201c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf46Lily at it again\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf46\u201d).\n\nThe targeted ads inform me that Lily, apparently, lives for drama. The reality of Lily\u2019s Garden is even more complicated. For one thing, the fake-pregnancy story line is not present in the game itself. According to Stella Sacco, the game\u2019s writer, those ads were created by a separate team. \u201cAll of those are all totally fabricated for, I guess, virality,\u201d she said \u201cAnd to that degree, I would say that it worked.\u201d Lily\u2019s Garden has a similarly intricate story line, but fans hoping for more information about the Lily from the ads might be found wanting.\n\nMost mobile games are designed to appeal to every demographic on Earth simultaneously. Consider this: what is the narrative of Candy Crush? Nobody knows, it\u2019s just bright colors and harmless shapes. Plus, most games have their narrative crafted to justify the mechanics of that game. For instance, if a developer makes a game where you can just hop into any car in the virtual world, the player\u2019s character might be designated a car thief in the narrative, as in Grand Theft Auto. But according to Sacco, Lily\u2019s Garden and its narrative structure is very deliberately targeted at what I\u2019ll call (non-pejoratively!) \u201cFacebook Moms,\u201d women over 30 who make up the largest audience for these types of mobile games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a much more fleshed out project than I\u2019ve worked on in terms of narrative for that particular demographic,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the largest demographic of people who play games on phones, which is wild. And they\u2019re also kind of unique in that, in general, the industry doesn\u2019t really take them seriously.\u201d\n\nAt a previous developer Sacco worked for, they apparently had an in-house category for these games called \u201cpink,\u201d and all the games for women fell into that bucket. \u201cIt\u2019s all pinks, and, you know, cute animals and all of that kind of stuff,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut nobody is really appealing to the women out there who watch cop shows every night, who love Hallmark movies. No one is taking them seriously. And so this story was an effort to do that.\u201d That helps the game stand out in contrast to other popular puzzle/gardening hybrid games, like Gardenscapes. Lily\u2019s Garden is Tactile\u2019s most narratively rich game, but it publishes a number of formulaic mobile titles with bright palettes, with names like Bee Brilliant and Cookie Cats.\n\nWhile the actual game doesn\u2019t feature a pregnancy hoax, or discussion of dick sizes \u2014 body shaming isn\u2019t a thing that Sacco says she\u2019d ever include \u2014 she does say that the narrative does touch on themes that are more mature than what you\u2019d normally find in a mobile game. There\u2019s a custody battle between Luke and his ex, and there\u2019s a mystery as to why great-aunt Mary didn\u2019t have kids of her own.\n\nThe increased emphasis on narrative and characterization has reportedly paid off. It\u2019s not tough to find plenty of people praising the game\u2019s story. Part of that stems from the effort of the game\u2019s creative team, part of it is because, admittedly, mobile games like it have a low bar to clear when it comes to narrative depth. \u201cAs a trans woman, you know, trans women don\u2019t necessarily get to write for mass market,\u201d Sacco said, noting how her experience led her to try to create a different type of female narrative. \u201cSo many pieces of [women\u2019s] media are catty, and really do involve women tearing each other down. It is everywhere. And the amount of people who have reacted positively to [the substantive female friendships] in the game, it makes me happy.\u201d\n\nThe reaction to the narrative thrust has been strong. For maybe the first time ever, it seems like people are playing what superficially seems like just another chintzy mobile game \u2026 for the story? The game\u2019s Instagram page, run as if it is Lily\u2019s own account, adds another layer of storytelling. Lily polls fans about what to do with the engagement ring Blaine gave her, she posts #tbt photos of her time with her great-aunt, she posts Stories about her changing hairstyles. She has 300,000 followers. There are exactly two types of comments. There are players cheering on Lily through her journey as if she were a real character (\u201cLILY U DONT DESERVE HIM TAKE CARE OF YOUR NEW \u2018BABY\u2019 WITHOUT HIM\u201d) and there are players who need tech support (\u201cI\u2019m stuck on level 86 please help me\u201d). Lily\u2019s Garden has tapped into the sort of obsession that fans of visual novels and character-driven dramas cultivate on platforms like Tumblr, and translated it to the most mass-market gaming sector.\n\nAll of this \u2014 the ads that have become memes, the mobile-game art-style, the soap opera\u2013like seasonal narrative, the players that obsessively follow and react to Lily\u2019s exploits like any other fandom \u2014 has created a disorienting potpourri of separate sectors of the internet. You get earnest Facebook denizens, ironic Twitter users, stans, gamers, messy bitches who live for drama all fixated on the same property for substantially different reasons.", "description": "Mysterious, highly specific ads for a mobile game about gardening have intrigued and confused countless individuals.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/18-lilys-garden.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
