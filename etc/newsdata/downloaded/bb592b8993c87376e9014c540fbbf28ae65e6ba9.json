We want to make sure that country is honest,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery here. Trump doesn\u2019t care about corruption \u2014 he runs a network of clubs and hotels where interested parties can spend huge sums and curry favor with the administration \u2014 but he is worried about Biden\u2019s popularity with Democrats and the wider public. The former vice president leads in nearly every head-to-head matchup with Trump. If the election were held today and Biden were the nominee, Trump would likely lose by double digits.\n\nBut if Trump can make 2020 another race between two unpopular nominees \u2014 if he can sully his opponent and make him another creature of \u201cthe swamp\u201d \u2014 then he has a shot at victory. Imagine a world where the Ukrainian government enters the election on behalf of Trump. The president can now do to Biden what he did to Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 mire him in enough scandal and innuendo to undermine the vice president\u2019s claim to honesty. \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d seamlessly becomes \u201cCrooked Joe.\u201d And Biden is vulnerable. He has spent his entire adult life working in Washington, and there\u2019s little question that his son is involved in the kinds of buck-raking and influence peddling that alienates voters and makes them cynical about politics.\n\nAs for the other parts of Trump\u2019s unusual 2016 victory, there isn\u2019t \u2014 as far as we know \u2014 an F.B.I. investigation of Biden or any other Democratic candidate. But Attorney General William Barr has already shown his willingness to use the law in Trump\u2019s favor, and Trump brought him up in his call with Zelensky. It was Barr, of course, whose misleading summary of the Mueller report initially defused criticism and stymied efforts to hold the president accountable for his attempts to obstruct justice.\n\nGiven this commitment to the president\u2019s political interests, it\u2019s not hard to imagine how Barr might use \u201crevelations\u201d from the Ukrainian government to pursue an inquiry into the former vice president and his son, releasing information at a pace that feeds the story, strengthens the appearance of impropriety and ultimately undermines Biden\u2019s campaign. Trump, at least, thinks the attorney general is up to the task. In Trump\u2019s conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Trump referred him to Barr . \u201cThere is a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d the president said to Zelensky, according to a recently released reconstructed transcript. \u201cSo whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\u201d The attorney general of the United States, that is.", "description": "He knows that the circumstances of his victory were unusual, so he is trying to recreate them.", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/opinion/25bouieWeb/25bouieWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
