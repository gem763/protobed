We'll pass this on to our relevant department, thanks for pointing it out to us!\"", "description": "A Primark customer has spotted yet another spelling mistake on an item sold by the retailer", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Raindropscloudy", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545327.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Primark.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
