The week-long lawyers\u2019 visit coincides with a separate trip by Northamptonshire police who are planning to interview Sacoolas over the accident. She has admitted involvement, but is claiming diplomatic immunity.\n\nAccording to the Foreign Office, the US state department has said her diplomatic immunity is no longer pertinent, but no elaboration has been given of what this phrase means in practical terms.\n\nIn an interview for the Mail on Sunday, Niall Dunn said there had been thoughts he had not been able to process properly about the death of his fraternal twin. Housebound with grief, he said he had been proud of the campaign his parents had mounted to find out the truth about why Sacoolas had been allowed to return to the US and avoid further UK police inquiries.\n\nSacoolas allegedly killed Dunn when driving on the wrong side of the road as she left RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, a US listening base on 27 August. She had only been in the country for a few weeks and admitted responsibility to the police in initial questioning.\n\nHarry Dunn death: UK police to interview Anne Sacoolas under caution Read more\n\nNiall Dunn appealed to Sacoolas, saying: \u201cWe want for this to be over, to live our lives the best way we can. We can\u2019t do that unless you cooperate and help us. This all could have been avoided if you had just stayed here and done the right thing. Although that time\u2019s passed you can still put an end to all of this.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not happy with how everything has happened. I\u2019ve wanted to start grieving but now it\u2019s become so huge that I have to be involved.\n\n\u201cWhen we were told Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity it was a punch in the face. \u2018Tough, she\u2019s not coming back, end of story. Go away and cry at home.\u2019 That\u2019s what it really did feel like. It was really difficult hearing that and knowing we had nowhere left to go, nothing left to do. They left us to just cry and grieve in silence. I\u2019m angry at the higher-ups of the world who just don\u2019t seem to care at all about what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cIt was swept under the carpet and that\u2019s what really got to me. It made me angry. Harry lost his life. We\u2019ve lost everything. I want to know who decided this was OK to do this to us.\u201d\n\nQ&A How does diplomatic immunity work? Show Hide Diplomatic immunity is the protection given under international and UK law to foreign diplomats and their families. It was formalised through the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (VCDR). Reciprocal global agreements also protect UK diplomats working abroad. Without a foreign state agreeing to lift immunity, diplomats and their dependent families can only be detained \u201cas a last resort\u201d if, for example, they are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves. The only other sanction available to the Foreign Office would be to order their expulsion. When a foreign state agrees to remove that legal protection, it is known as a \u201cwaiver of immunity\u201d. Individual diplomats cannot do so; the embassy of the foreign state has to make a formal request. As well as covering diplomats and their families anywhere in the UK, the same convention and legislation prevents UK officials from entering diplomatic premises. That inviolability enabled Julian Assange to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years. Owen Bowcott, Legal affairs correspondent\n\nIn the interview Niall Dunn revealed that the police had wanted to charge Sacoolas with death by dangerous driving, which could have meant a custodial sentence. But six days after Harry\u2019s death, unaware that there were questions already being raised behind the scenes over Sacoolas\u2019s diplomatic status, the family requested the charge was reduced to death by careless driving, which usually involves a suspended sentence and would avoid separating her from her children.\n\nA week later Sacoolas left the UK on a commercial flight claiming diplomatic immunity. The family were not informed until 10 days later, and there are now serious questions over whether the Foreign Office\u2019s advice to the police \u2013 namely, that Sacoolas was entitled to such immunity \u2013 was correct.\n\nThe claim rests on a written agreement \u2013 currently not in the public domain \u2013 between the US and the UK over the status of staff and their dependents at the base.", "description": "US intelligence officer\u2019s wife fled after admitting involvement in fatal crash", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab8f790ce6ea03cf01f16c43ce0d8bec783eb718/341_23_1653_992/master/1653.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=602fe78173ddf4a50f7880f85a78be2f", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
