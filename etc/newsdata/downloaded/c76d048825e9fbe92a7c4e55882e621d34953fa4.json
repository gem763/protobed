As part of the raising, the company has provided guidance on FY20e, which appears optimistic to us at this stage. We forecast EBITDA of $131 million in FY20e, compared with the company\u2019s guidance of $150 million.\n\nOur revised target price of $2.90, down from $4.20, reflects the impact of lower earnings forecasts and the valuation changes described above. We set our rating at Neutral. Costa\u2019s shares will recommence trading on 30 October 2019. Given the shares have not traded with the changed information about the capital raising and its earnings outlook, our Neutral rating should be taken with caution and viewed in light of how the shares trade later this week.\n\nMacquarie\n\nCGC expects CY20 EBITDA-SL of $150m and NPAT-SL approx. in line with CY18 of $56.6m, which represents a c50% and 100% increase respectively on pcp. FY20 fct contemplates a \u201cmoderate improvement of dry weather/drought conditions and more normal season and crop cycles in Aust and Morocco\u201d. However there is downside risk to fct should severe drought conditions persist (eg yield, fruit size etc).\n\nWe lower recommendation to UP from Neutral noting that earnings visibility continues to be limited along with a range of seasonal/agricultural risk factors at play. Given CGC\u2019s poor earnings track record over last year, we think delivery is required to restore the faith; CGC\u2019s CY20 guidance looks optimistic in this regard (we have taken a more conservative view and are 12% below EBITDA guidance).\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nOur valuation falls to A$3.40, rating remains OUTPERFORM relative to the issue price of A$2.20. The uncertain input to CGC valuation is long-term margin assumptions driven by output pricing. Yields and volume tend to normalise over time. Cost increases, water included, were not a major factor in CGC's 2019 downgrades. We lowered our average long-term margin assumption for the Produce division from 14% to 12%.", "description": "There would've been plenty of talk about Costa Group at morning meetings on Tuesday as sell-side teams ready recommendations on what is an important day for the fruit and vegetable grower.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1839%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/77b1761f7a2e0eb9540c0a4d91df43b49f60ad0a", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
