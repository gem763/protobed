And while two-thirds support stricter fuel-efficiency standards for the nation\u2019s cars and trucks, increases in the gas tax remain deeply unpopular\u2026\n\nFor Trump, climate change also could prove to be an issue, even among his GOP base. Though Democrats and independents are more likely to think climate change is caused by human activity, a majority of Republicans \u2014 60 percent \u2014 say they, too, believe that, The Post-KFF survey finds. And 23 percent of Republicans say they disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, compared with just 9 percent of Republicans who disapprove of his job performance overall.", "description": "", "authors": ["Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Climate-Environment Americans-Increasingly-See-Climate-Change-As-A-Crisis-Poll-Shows"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
