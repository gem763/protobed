Pelosi, in a letter last week to House Minority Leader(R-Calif.), said that existing House rules provide committees \u201cwith full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations.\u201dBefore the White House formally made its intentions known, Democrats had reacted to the State Department\u2019s decision to block U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s deposition by issuing a subpoena for messages on a personal device that he turned over to the department.They also doubled down on warning that preventing witnesses from testifying will be used as evidence of obstruction, which could become an additional article of impeachment.\u201cThese actions appear to be part of the White House\u2019s effort to obstruct the impeachment inquiry and to cover up President Trump\u2019s misconduct from Congress and the American people. Ambassador Sondland\u2019s testimony and documents are vital, and that is precisely why the Administration is now blocking his testimony and withholding his documents,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman(D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman(D-N.Y.) and Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman(D-Md.) said in a joint statement.\u201cWe consider this interference to be obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.\u201dThe White House has rejected those arguments, stating in its Tuesday letter, \u201cThe president has a country to lead.\u201dLawmakers were eager to question Sondland, a former hotelier and major Trump donor who emerged as a key figure in text messages provided to the House committees last week by former Ukraine envoyIn those messages between Volker, Giuliani and other officials, Sondland is shown discussing Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open an investigation. Those talks took place before and after Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he pressed for looking into former Vice Presidentand the business dealings of his son Hunter.In the text messages provided by Volker, Sondland dismissed concerns from William Taylor, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires for Ukraine, about withholding military aid while Trump pressed for the investigation.\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote in a Sept. 9 message.Sondland replied: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions.\u201d\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\u201d Sondland wrote.Yet The Wall Street Journal reported that Sondland told Sen.(R-Wis.) that the aid to Ukraine was contingent on opening the investigation pursued by Trump. Johnson said that Trump denied the notion of a quid pro quo when he asked about it.Trump defended the decision not to allow Sondland to testify.\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\u201d Trump tweeted.Giuliani told The Washington Post on Tuesday that he wouldn\u2019t testify before the House Intelligence Committee unless there\u2019s an impeachment inquiry vote and Schiff is removed. He added that he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d anyone from the Trump administration would either.The House committees are also seeking depositions with George Kent, the State Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, and State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, though their testimony is now in doubt.The lawyer representing two of Giuliani\u2019s business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, also said they would not appear for requested depositions.At the moment, the House committees only have one confirmed witness testimony scheduled.", "description": "The White House in a blistering letter to Congress said Tuesday it would refuse to cooperate further with the House impeachment inquiry, arguing Democrats were pursuing a \"constitutionally invalid\" inves", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_pelosinancy_100819asgn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
