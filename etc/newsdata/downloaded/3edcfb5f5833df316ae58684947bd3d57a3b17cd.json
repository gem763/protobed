No place is that clearer than in Japan at the CEATEC tech trade show just outside of Tokyo.\n\nYou may not see all of these things in a store, home or office near you anytime soon \u2013 CEATEC\u2019s emphasis on research made it look a bit like a science fair compared to such larger gadget gatherings as CES in Las Vegas and IFA in Berlin. But Japan\u2019s longstanding status as a leading indicator of technology makes it likely that some of these things will wind up in your life.\n\nANA\u2019s avatar ambitions\n\nOn this convention\u2019s first day, All Nippon Airways president and CEO Shinya Katanozaka talked up the airline\u2019s plans to let people skip flying by experiencing other places through robot avatars.\n\n\u201cWhat we're aiming for in 2050 is a world in which there's no difference between your body and the avatar itself,\u201d Katanozaka said through an interpreter.\n\nBut the \u201cnewme\u201d telepresence robots demonstrated on stage during his keynote \u2013 essentially, tablet computers on brightly-colored cylinders that roll around on wheels \u2013 can\u2019t do all that. Exhibits at ANA\u2019s booth suggested what else the airline will need, and how difficult that might be.\n\nAll Nippon Airways is planning to add robots to its friendly skies. Among them is robot hand with sensor-studded gloves that's controlled by a human operator.

Another had me control a fishing rod and reel 750 miles away, an experience that both exhibited a visible lag and emphasized the fact that I haven\u2019t gone fishing in decades.\n\nApple, Fitbit, Fossil, Samsung: How to choose the right smartwatch\n\nThe Paramount Bed\u2019s Active Sleep monitors your pulse and breathing and reclines as needed. (Photo: Rob Pegoraro)\n\nA bed that reclines itself\n\nSleep-tracking systems are nothing new, but a bed that responds to your sleep is. Paramount Bed\u2019s Active Sleep, a combination of motorized bed frame, air mattress, sleep-tracking pad and software smarts, monitors your pulse and breathing and reclines as needed. Typically, you\u2019d start with the mattress somewhat elevated to help you nod off, then the bed would lower itself to a flat position. That comfort, plus the ability to adjust the pressure independently in each of the mattress\u2019s six different cells, goes for \u00a5430,000, or almost $4,000.\n\nThe Lixil smart toilet has a camera on the underside of the seat, seen here, that takes a picture of your waste and comes back flush with personal data. (Photo: Rob Pegoraro)\n\nA toilet that knows your\u2026 business\n\nToilets in Japan have long been high-tech marvels with heated seats and water jets to cleanse you, but a prototype on display here from Lixil takes its electronics to a new level. A camera on the underside of the seat takes a picture of your output to gauge its softness on a medical scale of 1 to 7, as computed by a cloud image-analysis routine.\n\nThe idea of this subsidiary of American Standard is to deploy this in nursing homes, where otherwise attendants would have to collect this data.\n\nXenoma makes an activity-tracking shirt for work, not exercise. The data insights are shown on a Microsoft HoloLens augmented-reality visor worn by the employee. (Photo: Rob Pegoraro)\n\nThis shirt watches you work\n\nHitachi\u2019s exhibit featured a live demo from a company called Xenoma that makes an activity-tracking shirt. The activity tracked here was not exercise but work, with insights from the resulting data shown on a Microsoft HoloLens augmented-reality visor worn by the employee.\n\nUndercover boss: Don't look now, but your boss is probably spying on you\n\nThe demo had that headwear offering suggestions to take a break. But in a real-world deployment, you have to expect that some bosses would use this system to nag their underlings to work harder.\n\nAI Gamer is a robot built to learn to play the 1980s-vintage arcade game Super Xevious.

AI Gamer is a robot built to learn to play the 1980s-vintage arcade game Super Xevious \u2013 a task it couldn\u2019t always handle \u2013 and to catch the attention of human passerby with a design that evokes friendly robots from 1980s-vintage movies.\n\nThis animatronic anime head named Mirai Komachi can read facial expressions and respond appropriately. (Photo: Rob Pegoraro)\n\nJust next to this cute little contraption, an animatronic anime head named Mirai Komachi read the facial expressions of passerby and responded correspondingly--meeting one smile with another, or reacting to a frown with a look of concern. Conclusion: The future looks less creepy when it features a bright line between people and robots.\n\n(Disclosure: CEATEC\u2019s organizers are covering my travel costs, along with those of a handful of other U.S.-based tech journalists.)\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C.
