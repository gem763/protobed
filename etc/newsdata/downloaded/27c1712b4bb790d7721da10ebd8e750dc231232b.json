(Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Raiders coach Jack Del Rio likened it to playing on \u201ccinder block.\u201d Team owner Mark Davis cited it as a main reason the Raiders needed a new stadium. A former NFL running back described falling on it as a particularly unpleasant experience.\n\n\u201cGo outside right now, sprint as fast as you can in the middle of the street, once you get to full speed jump up as high as you can and belly flop on the pavement,\u201d Justin Forsett, who played three career games in Oakland as a member of the Seahawks, Jaguars and Ravens, wrote Monday night on Twitter.\n\nWe are, of course, talking about the dirt baseball infield that has long taken up a sizable chunk of the Oakland Raiders\u2019 home football field during early-season games, when the NFL team\u2019s schedule overlaps with that of Major League Baseball\u2019s Oakland Athletics. It\u2019s a peculiar relic of a time when professional football and baseball teams shared stadiums that somehow could accommodate both the somewhat irregular shape of a baseball field and the rigid rectangle of the football gridiron.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the Raiders will be leaving Oakland for Las Vegas after this season. Sunday\u2019s home game against the Chiefs will be the final one that overlaps with the A\u2019s schedule and thus will be the final NFL game to feature a weird baseball imprint on the field; after that, the Raiders do not return to RingCentral Coliseum until Nov. 3, a few days after any World Series Game 7 could be played (the A\u2019s currently are in the thick of the American League wild-card chase).\n\nThe infield dirt isn\u2019t the only problem, as the grass between the bases presents problems of its own.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an issue since I\u2019ve been playing here,\u201d Raiders running back Jalen Richard said last year. \u201cTo hear from older guys, it\u2019s been an issue, especially more so around the pitcher\u2019s mound because that area doesn\u2019t get used as much as the outfield. Playing baseball, those guys are steadily running in the outfield, so that grass out there is a little bit sturdier. Inside the mound, by the diamond, that\u2019s where it is real slippery.\"\n\nThe grass, the dirt: It all was just a little weird.\n\n\u201cThrowing off second base can be a challenge,\u201d former Raiders quarterback Bruce Gradkowski, who played in 10 games at the Coliseum in 2009 and 2010, joked to the Beaver County (Pa.) Times in 2013.\n\nOver the years, players didn\u2019t complain so much about the raspberries they would receive while getting tackled to the dirt but rather the footing it did or did not provide. Proper footwear was a must.\n\n\u201cIf that dirt gets real wet, you can\u2019t get any footing,\u201d former Raiders running back Napoleon Kaufman said in 2013. \u201cWhereas if it\u2019s not wet at all, your cleat won\u2019t get down into the dirt.\u201d\n\nThis was a real issue for kickers, especially for the plant foot, which \u201cis your anchor to the ground when kicking and sets up the rest of your body to make the kick, or miss it,\u201d the blog American Kicker wrote in 2011. No one likely knows this better than Sebastian Janikowski, who spent all but one season of his 18-year NFL career playing for the Raiders and said it was more of a problem for visiting kickers than for him, considering his experience on the surface.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d Janikowski said in 2013. \u201cI think it\u2019s an advantage for us. Guys come in and they think about it so much. And I\u2019m not going to tell them what to do.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Janikowski had to defuse a minor cross-sport controversy after fellow kicker Josh Scobee told the Florida Times-Union that Janikowski had told him he annually hoped the A\u2019s did not make the playoffs so the full-sod football field could be laid down as early as possible. Janikowski said Scobee was lying and that he was a big fan of the A\u2019s, being especially close friends with former utility player Jason Giambi.\n\n\u201cIf they make the postseason, I\u2019m in,\u201d Janikowski said.\n\nStill, over his long career Janikowski made 82.1 percent of his field goal attempts on the road. At home, that number dipped to 78.8 percent.\n\nEven if the Raiders said publicly that they supported their MLB brethren, the relief they showed when baseball season annually ended was palpable, especially in the years when the A\u2019s extended their season by hosting playoff games, something that happened 13 times during the time they have shared at the Coliseum\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy about that. I\u2019m not happy the A\u2019s didn\u2019t make the playoffs, I\u2019m happy to be able to play on grass,\u201d Raiders cornerback David Amerson said in 2017. \u201cEspecially for a defensive back.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nRaiders\u2019 Gareon Conley expected to recover after suffering a scary injury in an odd collision\n\nSome Dolphins players reportedly aren\u2019t all that fond of the team\u2019s tanking plans\n\n\u2018Not bad for a running back\u2019: Lamar Jackson answers critics with dominant Week 1", "description": "Sunday\u2019s game against the Chiefs will be the last in which Oakland will have a baseball diamond crowding its football field.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Am", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
