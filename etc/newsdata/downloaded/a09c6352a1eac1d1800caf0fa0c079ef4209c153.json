They worried that impeachment could easily backfire on Democrats, galvanizing Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in next year\u2019s elections and drowning out people\u2019s concerns about health care, immigration and the economy.\n\nGun control is a top priority for Ms. Schneeberger, 60, because her four adult children, ages 26 to 37, are teachers worried about their students\u2019 safety. But now, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s just getting sidelined again.\u201d\n\nWhile politicians in Washington crowded microphones on Wednesday to condemn or defend Mr. Trump and the prospect of his impeachment, more than two dozen voters across the country were by turns elated and wary, unsure and already exhausted, at the idea of an impeachment investigation that could consume the nation for months.", "description": "For many Democratic voters around the country, the prospect of an explosive impeachment battle in Washington left them nervous.
