Exports to the United States, China\u2019s biggest market, sank 16% to $44.4 billion.\n\nBoth sides have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s imports in the fight over complaints about Beijing\u2019s trade surplus and technology development plans. The United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Chinese market-opening commitments.\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators are preparing for talks in October. Despite that, the two governments escalated their fight on Sept. 1, imposing or increasing penalties on billions of dollars of goods. President Donald Trump plans another increase Oct. 15.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

That hurts efforts to find markets to replace the United States.\n\n\u201cThe tit-for-tat escalation shows how unlikely a trade deal and de-escalation have become,\u201d said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report. \u201cMeanwhile, the global trade weakness looks set to linger, which will continue to weigh on demand for China\u2019s exports.\u201d\n\nThe conflict has disrupted trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment, battered traders on both sides and fueled fears in financial markets of a global economic slowdown.\n\nChina\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to $31.3 billion in August from $27 billion a year earlier.\n\nChina\u2019s global exports fell 3% to $214.8 billion, while imports were up 1.7% at $180 billion. For the first eight months of 2019, exports were off 1% from a year earlier and imports were down 5.6%.\n\nChina\u2019s global trade surplus rose 25% from a year earlier to $34.8 billion.\n\nExports to the European Union rose 3% from a year earlier to $38.3 billion.\n\nU.S.-Chinese negotiations broke down in May over how to enforce any agreement. Beijing says Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs must be lifted once an agreement takes effect. Washington says some must stay to ensure Beijing carries out any promises it makes.\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume negotiations, though neither side shifted its position. Talks in Shanghai in July ended with no indication of progress.\n\nThe governments agreed to meet again in September but that was postponed to October. They have yet to announce a date.\n\nWashington imposed 15% tariffs on Sept. 1 on $112 billion of Chinese imports and plans to hit another $160 billion on Dec. 15. That would extend penalties to almost everything the United States buys from China.\n\nBeijing responded by imposing duties of 10% and 5% on a range of American imports. More increases are due on Dec. 15 in line with the U.S. penalties.\n\nU.S. tariffs of 25% imposed previously on $250 billion of Chinese goods are due to rise to 30% on Oct. 1.\n\nChina has imposed or announced penalties on an estimated $120 billion of U.S. imports. Some have been hit with increases more than once, while about $50 billion of U.S. goods is unaffected, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries.\n\nBeijing also has retaliated by canceling purchases of soybeans, the biggest single U.S. export to China.\n\nThe Chinese government has agreed to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nSome analysts suggest Beijing is holding out in hopes Trump will feel pressure to make a more favorable deal as his campaign for the 2020 presidential election picks up. Trump has warned that if he is reelected, China will face a tougher U.S. negotiating stance.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "China's trade with the U.S. is falling as the two sides prepare for negotiations with no signs of progress toward ending the tariff war.", "authors": ["Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/china-trade-war-.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
