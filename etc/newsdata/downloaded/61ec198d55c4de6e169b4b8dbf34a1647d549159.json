Then after that, it was all getting on fire. We had to walk out. There was a little house and a big dusty mountain and behind it everybody was dead.'\n\nAt just ten, Amira has seen death and destruction on an unimaginable scale.\n\nIt's been eight months since the flame-filled horrors of Baghouz.\n\nUntil yesterday, Amira and her two siblings, sister Hiba, and brother Hamza, six, were among 24 orphans largely fending for themselves in part of a camp near the town of Ain Assa.\n\nOf the 13,000 women and children there, around 1,000 are linked to IS.\n\nThe 10-year-old is forced to take care of her family in a camp that housed nearly 13,000 women and children. The area around the camp was attacked and its jihadi brides and youngsters overran the guards and escaped\n\nHours after Amira told her story, the area around the camp was attacked and its jihadi brides and youngsters overran the guards and escaped.\n\nAlong with the rest of the occupants, the children disappeared.\n\nBut last night, reports suggested they were safe.\n\nThe current conflict in the region began on Wednesday when Donald Trump pulled US troops from the border, allowing Turkish soldiers to march in under the pretence of fighting 'terrorism' by killing Syrian-Kurds.\n\nAmira, Hiba and Hamza are believed to be from the UK. She has a grandmother, a woman Amira remembers only as 'Grandmum' \u2013 who may very well have seen her granddaughter on screen yesterday.\n\nBut any hopes of a reunion will have been swiftly shattered by the breakout.\n\nJelal Ayaf, co-chairman of the camp, north of the former de-facto IS capital of Raqqa, said it came under attack from IS sleeper cells, allowing 859 foreign jihadi wives and their children to escape.\n\nBBC footage shows her spelling out where she used to live. Last night there were reports that they had reached safety\n\nKurdish leaders said the escape came with the help of 'mercenaries', a reference to Syrian rebel fighters allied with Turkey. Turkish warplanes are said to have dropped a bomb nearby, causing chaos.\n\nMustafa Bali, spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a largely Kurdish militia that helped defeat IS, said: 'IS members attacked the camp guard and opened the doors to flee.\n\n'Almost all suspected IS militants fled the camp.'\n\nThe camp is almost empty, with only a few inmates said to remain along with masked foreigners circling the camp on motorbikes.\n\nBritish female IS members are among those thought to be on the run, including alleged recruiter Tooba Gondal, 25, from Walthamstow, east London, who reportedly lured Bethnal Green schoolgirl Shamima Begum and two classmates to Syria with promises of marriage to IS fighters.\n\nWar in the area rumbles on as a Turkish airstrike hits the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain\n\nGondal was believed to have been in the camp with her two children after being caught trying to get to Turkey.\n\nZara Iqbal \u2013 who has pleaded to return to Britain after travelling to the warzone with her sister, Reema, and their children from east London \u2013 was also one of those known to have been in the camp.\n\nBut these heartbreaking images of Amira prove that some of the camp's occupants are so young they can only be the innocent victims of someone else's war.\n\nAmira should be in primary school with her friends, keeping an eye on her little brother and sister in the playground.\n\nInstead, she can only speak English when she is alone with her siblings. In the presence of others they speak Arabic.\n\nAmira recalls enough of her life in Britain to tell a BBC film crew her that she is from London. Writing phonetically, she slowly scribbles on a scrap of paper: 'LaDN, uKeH.'\n\nShe remembers simple things \u2013 the park, going to a funfair, a restaurant. And she remembers going to her 'Grandmum's house'.\n\nBut other, more horrifying memories are clearer.\n\nThe children are thought to have been taken from London to the so-called caliphate by their parents \u2013 supporters of IS \u2013 five years ago and have spent most of their short lives under its brutal regime.\n\n'When we were in Baghouz we were living in tents and there wasn't much food. In the morning, they were bombing,' Amira said. 'They bombed one tent.\n\n'So then our Dad told us to come out, to quickly take our important stuff and come out before our tent catches fire. We took our stuff and we were walking. They were hitting so much, we had to run.'\n\nShe told BBC reporter Quentin Somerville how her older brother went to find their father, only for her mother, little brother and sister to be killed in an explosion. Describing how he returned afterwards, she said: 'He was running up because he knows my Mum was dead there. But everything he could find they were hitting with bombs, and there were guns.\n\n'He just ran in and went down, and then when he was running the little house broke and everything went on fire so he died.'\n\nIn the footage, Hiba looks sorrowful as her green jumper is lifted up to reveal a vivid vertical scar stretching the length of her abdomen, a reminder of other horrific experiences that remain untold.\n\nHowever, Amira lives in hope, describing how she wants one day to have a garden filled with watermelon, strawberries, cherries, blueberries and apples.\n\nThe heartbreaking footage has renewed debate about whether Britain should take in children taken to or born in IS territory by their British parents.\n\nIt was estimated this year that at least 30 British children were being held with their mothers in dangerous, overcrowded camps in northern Syria. The Government is under pressure from Syrian authorities and Donald Trump to bring them home. But ministers say it is too dangerous to go in and rescue them.\n\nLast night, a Government spokesman said: 'There may be British children in 'internally displaced persons' camps in Syria who, because of their age, are innocent victims of the conflict.\n\n'We look at all evidence to determine someone's nationality and will examine every single case where we are asked for consular assistance, but this process is far from straightforward.'\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel said last month: 'I am simply not willing to allow anybody who has been an active supporter or campaigner of IS in this country.'\n\nA Home Office spokesman said she had not changed her mind, adding that children were 'victims first and foremost'. But he said: 'But they may also pose a threat and these cases would need to be dealt with carefully.'\n\nSince last year, Britain has a revoked the citizenship of IS fighters and supporters, stripping passports from several in Syrian jails and camps.\n\nIn the case of Amira and her siblings, the emptying of Ain Issa camp makes the issue of repatriation redundant for now.\n\nThere is no consular assistance in Syria, so unless the children make it to the border with Turkey or Iraq, they will have to wait a long time. Ain Issa, 20 miles south of Turkey, had one of the largest US-led coalition bases in north-eastern Syria.\n\nNow, in the wake of President Trump's decision to withdraw his troops from the area, Kurdish forces who fought with the US against IS have warned that they may not be able to maintain detention camps holding thousands of militants while they try to hold off the Turks.\n\nAs to the consequences, the dangers were spelled out earlier this year de-facto SDF foreign minister Abdul Karim Omar.\n\nHe told me that if the UK did not take back its fighters and their wives Britain faced seeing them all being freed.\n\nSpeaking in Qamishli \u2013 which is now under attack by Turkey \u2013 he predicted IS and Turkey would go on the offensive, adding: 'There will be huge war and this will create huge immigration. Those fighters and their wives will come back to Britain and be terrorists in the UK. Not only the fighters but also the children. They will be ticking time bombs.'\n\nAs for Amira and her siblings, what horrors lie ahead? Last night there were reports that the three children were safe.\n\nOne can only hope they are \u2013 and that somewhere in Britain, a grandmother now knows three of her grandchildren may still be alive.", "description": "Amira vanished into the desert with sister Hiba and brother Hamza after the camp they were staying in was attacked.
