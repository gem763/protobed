Most Surface devices haven\u2019t been easy to upgrade or fix, scoring rather poorly on iFixit\u2019s repairability scale. For example, the Surface Pro 6 got a one, and the Surface Laptop 2 got a zero. However, Microsoft is trying to make things better in the repairability department with the new Surface Pro X and Surface Laptop 3 by making their SSDs upgradable and easier to access \u2014 but that\u2019s about as far as Microsoft\u2019s effort goes.\n\nOn the Surface Pro X, the SSD is hidden behind the kickstand, where there\u2019s a small plate you can pop off using a SIM ejector tool. Under that plate you\u2019ll find an M.2 SSD, which, it seems, you can unscrew and take out yourself. Microsoft tells us it\u2019s an M.2 2230 SSD, which is smaller than most M.2 SSDs, and not super easy to come by \u2014 we couldn\u2019t find a single one on Amazon or Newegg, for example.\n\nWatch my colleague Tom Warren quickly get to the SSD in the video below:\n\nMicrosoft says that the hard drive is \u201cnot user removable\u201d and should be replaced by a trained Microsoft technician. But if you really want to try to make the swap yourself, it seems like you might be able to \u2014 just don\u2019t forget to have the right Torx screwdriver handy and a way to load Windows onto your new SSD, once you\u2019ve managed to actually buy one that\u2019s compatible.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 3 also seems to have an easier way to get into the device \u2014 but it appears to be more complicated than the plate on the Surface Pro X. Onstage at Microsoft\u2019s event, Surface boss Panos Panay demonstrated how, with the right tools, it\u2019s possible to remove the entire top plate of the Surface Laptop 3 to get at all of the computer\u2019s internals:\n\nBut like with the Surface Pro X, it turns out that only the SSD is replaceable and should only be fixed by trained Microsoft technicians. Microsoft told The Verge that the RAM is not replaceable or upgradable at all.\n\nEven though the ability to upgrade the devices is limited, it\u2019s still a big step forward, iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens tells The Verge. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge change for Microsoft\u2019s product line across the board,\u201d he says, calling the previous Surface Laptop \u201cflat out the worst laptop we\u2019ve ever disassembled.\u201d (That was the one that got the repairability score of zero.) He says that Microsoft making the Surfaces more upgradable is \u201csignaling a significant change in intent behind the product, and, I think, a really positive direction.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft seems to be taking shots at Apple\n\nBy making its new devices even a little bit easier to upgrade, Microsoft also seems to be taking shots at Apple, which has never let you upgrade the memory chips of an iPad and been making it more and more difficult in its laptops, too, first by moving to what originally seemed like a proprietary SSD and later simply soldering the chips to the board. Nowadays, if you want more memory or storage in an Apple product, you have to pay a premium when you first buy the device, though SSD storage on Apple laptops is cheaper than it used to be.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s repairability options pale in comparison to some of its Windows competitors, where laptops like the Dell XPS 15 let you change out the RAM, SSD, battery, and more just by unscrewing the bottom panel. But we\u2019ll take what we can get.", "description": "Most Surface devices haven\u2019t been easy to upgrade or fix, scoring rather poorly on iFixit\u2019s repairability scale.
