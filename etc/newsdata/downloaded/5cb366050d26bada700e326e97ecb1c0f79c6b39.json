MCK, +1.16%, Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.64%, AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +0.16% and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA, -3.47% all fell in premarket trading Monday, after the drug companies reached a last-minute settlement with two Ohio counties in opioid litigation, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said the settlements come just in time to avoid a trial. Walgreens Boosts Alliance Inc. WBA, -1.14%, which is also in litigation on its role in the opioid crisis, had not yet reached a deal by Monday morning, the WSJ report said. The settlement still falls short of a more comprehensive deal being negotiated to resolve thousands of opioid lawsuits. Shares of McKesson slid 2.2% ahead of the open, Cardinal Health fell 1.5%, AmerisourceBergen shed 1.8% and Teva dropped 4.0%, while futures ESZ19, +0.39% for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.39% rose 8 points, or 0.3%. Walgreens's stock slipped 0.6% premarket.", "description": "Shares of McKesson Corp. , Cardinal Health Inc. , AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. all fell in premarket trading Monday, after...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
