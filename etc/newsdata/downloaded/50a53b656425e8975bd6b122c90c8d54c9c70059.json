Like, super long. We\u2019re talking Lord of the Rings long. If you don\u2019t want to invest even more hours watching the first 20 movies that lead up to that point, either, it can be a struggle keeping up with one of the biggest pop culture moments. Luckily, the incredibly talented students at Walden Grove High School in Sahuarita, Arizona have managed to condense it all into seven minutes.\n\nHow, you may ask? Through the power of dance, of course!\n\nSeriously, these kids are incredible. They manage to hit all the high points from Infinity War \u2014 Thanos\u2019 invasion on Earth, his fight with Iron Man on the planet Titan, Thor\u2019s close attempt to killing Thanos, half of the world\u2019s population disappearing (referred to as \u201cThe Blip\u201d) \u2014 and the biggest moments of Endgame. Spoiler alert: watching Tony Stark die again, even in dance form, is still a tearjerker. That\u2019s especially true when it\u2019s set to Requiem for a Dream\u2019s \u201cLux Aeterna\u201d theme by Clint Mansell.\n\nThe video was published on September 6th and has close to two million views, but it seems to just be picking up traction on YouTube. Rightfully so! A dive into the Walden Grove High School\u2019s YouTube channel brings up some more choreographed gems. There\u2019s a version of Harry Potter, a tribute to Pixar, and the Wizard of Oz! Each of these dances are performed as part of their homecoming celebration, which prompts a few more questions, such as:\n\nWhen did the students prepare these intricate dances?\n\nDid they practice all summer long just to get them right?\n\nHow do they choose what to adapt via dance?\n\nDo they plan to take the show on the road?\n\nIf so, where do we purchase tickets?\n\nTeenagers live in a very weird moment \u2014 TikToks are taking over classrooms, everyone has a vlog on YouTube, and people entering high school now were just four years old when the first Iron Man came out. They grew up with the Avengers, and seeing them pay tribute to the fallen is quite frankly beautiful.\n\nBetween this class and the drama students at North Bergen High School who put on an astounding production of Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien, it\u2019s pretty clear that the kids are going to be alright.", "description": "A group of high school students at Walden Grove High School have offered their dance interpretation of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.
