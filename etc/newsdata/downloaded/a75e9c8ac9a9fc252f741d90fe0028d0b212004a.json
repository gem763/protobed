Robert Burke said.\n\nThe Navy has 290 ships, with 300 projected by the autumn of 2020, but maintaining the ships, and expected declining budgets in future fiscal years, are a cause for concern, Burke said Friday.\n\n\u201cWill we get to 355 ships?\u201d Burke asked at the Military Reports and Editors conference in Arlington, Va. \u201cI think with today\u2019s fiscal situation, where the Navy\u2019s top line is right now, we can keep around 305 to 310 ships whole, properly manned, properly maintained, properly equipped, and properly ready.\u201d\n\nHe added that although the 355-ship target is appropriate, \u201cit\u2019s more important that we have the maximum capability to address every challenge that we might face.\u201d\n\nCurrently, about 30 percent of the Navy\u2019s destroyer fleet can leave port on schedule after repairs, and six of 11 aircraft carriers are under repair; one is the USS Harry S. Truman, whose electrical problems forced a cancellation of its deployment to the Middle East in September\n\nRep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., told a Navy official during a House Armed Services Committee meeting on Wednesday, \u201cIf you cannot take care of a 290-ship fleet, so maybe you shouldn\u2019t build more.\u201d\n\nIn September, the Congressional Budget Office noted a growing federal deficit and estimated the Navy would require an additional $200 billion, over its current estimated shipbuilding budget for the next 30 years, to attain a 355-ship fleet.\n\nThe U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are expected to conclude a new structure assessment by the end of the year which will allow the two branches to save funding by integrating some of their operations and spending.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 A lack of funding will prevent the U.S. Navy from maintaining a planned fleet of 355 ships, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
