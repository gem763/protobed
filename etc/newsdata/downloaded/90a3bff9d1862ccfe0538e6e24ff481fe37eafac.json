So yeah, I may come across as a beauty-product fiend. That is possibly true. Friends routinely ask me for recommendations, and I often get annoyed hearing what they\u2019re putting on their skin. (What? You\u2019re bothering with THAT?) I\u2019ve chronicled my daytime skin-care routine here on the Strategist, but when it comes to nighttime products, I\u2019ve got especially strong opinions about what works and what\u2019s an absolute waste. Such as:\n\nFirst of all, the whole idea that the skin sleeps and restores itself at night is completely ridiculous. The skin is an organ. It can\u2019t sleep. We wouldn\u2019t want it to. But at the end of the day, when the makeup comes off and our faces aren\u2019t disturbed by wind, rain, or sweat \u2014 that\u2019s a great time to power on hardworking treatment products such as a glycolic-acid serum, with its now-legendary buoyancy-restoring, cell-turnover, glow-giving skills.\n\nThe author.

Some are longtime favorites of mine from legacy brands; others come from upstart backwoods suppliers I\u2019d never heard of \u2014 not to mention the innovations flowing in from Japan and Korea. All of this is good news for anyone who cares about her or his skin.\n\nThird, on the other hand, I don\u2019t automatically buy the hype about all the exfoliators, peptides, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, etc., that are now added to treatment products. Sure, some of them, like AHAs (my all-time favorite skin rejuvenators) and kojic acid (a skin lightener), have proven credentials. But others \u2014 sage \u2026 royal jelly \u2026 barley \u2014 while they may be nutritious when eaten, they don\u2019t come with a lot of evidence that they\u2019re beneficial when applied to the skin, which, after all, is a barrier.\n\nFourth, and this one is crucial: I\u2019ve learned to hedge my bets when it comes to using high-octane treatment products. To get the specific benefits of each, I rotate them from day to day. So for example, I use only one glycolic product per night. And on non-glycolic nights, I\u2019ll use just one of my moisturizers. I even take nights off with nothing on my face.\n\nFifth, a confession: I\u2019ve developed a taste for scented treatment products. Late at night, my nose appreciates the ones that are soothing. But they\u2019re not for everyone. Laurel Naversen Geraghty, a dermatologist practicing in Medford, Oregon (who led a past life as a beauty writer and editor), says, \u201cFragrance added to skin-care products is one of the most common causes of allergic skin rashes. For anyone with sensitive, rash-y, itchy, or irritable skin, it\u2019s safest to choose unscented skin-care products.\u201d\n\nFinally, I\u2019ve learned that nothing terrible happens to my face if I\u2019m too sleepy to cleanse it every once in a while.\n\nMakeup remover\n\nAndrea Eye Q's Moisturizing Eye Makeup Remover Pads, 65-Count (Pack of 3) I always start my nighttime face cleansing with the moisturizing version of Andrea Eye Q\u2019s Eye Make-Up Remover Pads. Better than any others I\u2019ve ever used, these little discs pretty much do away with every last trace of eye makeup \u2014 even the mysteriously stubborn Moroccan kohl that otherwise stayed on my lids for a couple of days. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nExfoliator\n\nNext comes exfoliation via scrubbing grains at least several nights a week. Dr. Geraghty recommends this step not only to strip away surface sebum but to very likely \u201cenhance the benefits of a glycolic peel,\u201d she says. To avoid irritation, the grains, I\u2019ve found, need to be tiny and evenly shaped. The Lancer Polish has them to perfection in the form of quartz and sodium-bicarbonate microcrystals. I also love the omnipresent lavender aroma. Alternatively, I just discovered the brand-new Face Stockholm Green Tea Exfoliator, which indeed contains green tea and, yes, has a delicate green-tea aroma. Blended with it are aloe, papaya, and, most important, cellulose \u2014 which is there to clump up with skin oils, creating a semi-soft grainy effect as it does so. Yet even gentle scrubs like these two aren\u2019t for everyone. \u201cSensitive skin types would be wise to start off using glycolic acid on a test spot before committing to a full-face peel,\u201d adds Dr. Geraghty.\n\nCleanser\n\nLancer the Method: Cleanser That same lavender scent pervades the Lancer Cleanser, the Lancer Polish\u2019s follow-up. I find this cream cleanser incredibly satisfying. It foams, making inroads into every millimeter of my face, giving a psychological spic-and-span impression. Plus, it has a rice-amino-acid complex to rev up hydration and suppleness. $74 at Amazon Buy $74 at Amazon Buy\n\nJessica Johnson 3N1 Hybrid Face Oil Alternatively, especially when the weather gets cold, I like an oil cleanser. Jessica Johnson 3N1 Hybrid Face Oil, which triples as a makeup remover and light moisturizer, has terrific cling power, and within seconds its light rose aroma bursts through. Maybe best of all, on really late nights, when the last thing I want to do is stand at the bathroom sink, it feels so great left on my skin that I don\u2019t bother with follow-ups. FYI, Johnson is a savvy aesthetician who plies her trade in Portland, Maine. $95 at Jessica Johnson Beauty Buy\n\nToner\n\nAmore Pacific Treatment Toner Next comes a toner. I like the frill-free varieties that feel like they\u2019re clearing out any cleanser residue. That\u2019s what the water- and alcohol-free Amore Pacific Treatment Toner does using red-ginseng extract as a water replacement and water-lily extract as a very mild astringent. I splash it on with my fingertips, rather than bothering with a cotton puff (which absorbs a lot of the liquid). $50 at Nordstrom Buy $50 at Sephora Buy\n\nSerum\n\nSkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense After umpteen years using prescription Retin-A and AHAs, my face doesn\u2019t have a ton of wrinkles, but I do get brown spots (which Dr. Geraghty often calls \u201cadult freckles,\u201d adding that they\u2019re caused by the sun). For stubborn discolorations, I spend a few months spot-treating them every morning and night with a prescription hydroquinone. Then, for the next few months, I switch to SkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense, containing kojic acid, a well-established botanical lightener derived from the same fungi used to make soy and sake. It operates by turning off melanin production and is extra-effective when combined, as it is here, with a couple of other melanin-busters: tranexamic acid, another Asian favorite, and niacinamide (vitamin B3). And since it helps prevent future discolorations, I apply it all over my face. You\u2019ve got to be persistent and patient with a lightener like this, using it every morning as well as at night. Spots begin fading after a month or two. Just keep at it. And whatever else you do, wear a broad-spectrum consistently. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d per Dr. Geraghty, \u201cthere\u2019s no point to any of it.\u201d $98 at Dermstore Buy\n\nSkinCeuticals Glycolic 10 Renew Overnight I\u2019m a committed glycolic-acid user. The glow and firmness it gives, the wrinkles it reduces \u2026 what\u2019s not to love? But when they were introduced in the 1980s, glycolics were irritating. They needed calming down. The new generation accomplishes just that. There are two glycolic gels, slightly different from each other, that I value so much I use both, rotating them on different nights after cleansing, toning, and applying a lightener. Each of these gels is lightweight, easily spreadable, and contains salicylic acid, which not only unclogs pores but is a calming anti-inflammatory. One of them is Glycolic 10 Renew from SkinCeuticals, well known for its high-grade treatment products; it\u2019s a 10 percent serum with a creamy consistency. It also contains jojoba and vitamin E, to soothe and moisturize, and phytic acid, a pore tightener. $80 at Dermstore Buy $80 at Bluemercury Buy\n\nDrunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum Equally excellent on my skin is the T.L.C. Framboos Glycolic Night Serum from Drunk Elephant, a savvy relative newcomer to high-octane skin care. This one\u2019s got a 12 percent blend of glycolic with salicylic, along with those supporting AHAs, lactic, tartaric, and citric acids \u2014 not to mention a slew of romantic-sounding botanical ingredients that complement and balance the AHAs. Raspberry extract (that\u2019s the \u201cframboos\u201d) is added to rehydrate. Cactus? That\u2019s for calming, while horse chestnut is said to help reduce the appearance of broken capillaries, and summer lilac is supposed to help curb UV damage. Both the Drunk Elephant and the SkinCeuticals glycolics leave my skin radiant and energized for a couple of days. And they don\u2019t need topping off with a moisturizer. That would reduce their potency. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Sephora Buy\n\nMoisturizer\n\nDermalogica Sound Sleep Cocoon Night Gel-Cream Then there are the nights when I go glycolic-free. Instead, I turn to the Dermalogica Sound Sleep Cocoon. I admit \u2026 its twist-to-unlock-and-pump container, delivering discreet dabs of gel-cream, appeals to the waste-not minimalist in me. And then there\u2019s the hit of sandalwood and patchouli \u2014 sensual in a soothing way. As it warms on my skin, it almost becomes a face perfume. But those are extra added attractions. This sleep mask also has treatment smarts, depositing a fine velvet-textured haze on my face. (Yes, it is like a cocoon. Good name.) Atypical botanicals in it, like tamarind-seed oil and wu zhu yu (evodia fruit, a Chinese-medicine staple), have a history as anti-inflammatories, while Persian silk-tree extract seems, at least, to leave a firming effect. And yes, my complexion feels firmer the next morning. Lovely! $80 at Ulta Beauty Buy $80 at Sephora Buy\n\nEminence Organic Monoi Age Corrective Night Cream for Face & Neck Years ago, at one of those Monoprix bargain stores in Paris, I caught my first whiff of monoi \u2014 a swoon-inducing blend of Tahitian gardenia and coconut oil. It came in a multipurpose beauty oil that I bought and treasured back home \u2026 until it ran out. Then just recently I stumbled on Eminence Organic Monoi Age Corrective Night Cream, an overnight moisturizer that\u2019s not only got that distinctive gardenia-coconut monoi combo but combines it with argan, evening primrose, jojoba, and grape-seed oil as well as shea butter. It slips onto my skin like fragrant silk, and in the morning my face feels firm and toned. What a find. $68 at Dermstore Buy $60 at Walmart Buy\n\nVermont's Original Bag Balm, 8 Ounce Tin Friends and I were hiking the supposedly not very difficult Mount Tom (ha! it was more like killer) outside Woodstock, Vermont, when a tumultuous rainstorm hit. Soaked to the bone, we trudged into town in our squishy boots. That was bad enough. My parched lips were even worse. Inquiring at the local drugstore, I was enthusiastically directed to Vermont\u2019s Original Bag Balm \u2014 an old-time farmer\u2019s remedy originally intended for overworked cow udders. (But plenty of humans use it too.) It came in a retro-looking cube-shaped forest-green tin that I instantly fell in love with. I bought the eight-ounce size. Ever since, I\u2019ve used it just about every night \u2014 not just on my lips but sometimes on my neck and collarbone area, and there\u2019s still plenty left. It\u2019s that concentrated. Made of lanolin, petroleum jelly, and 8-hydroxyquinoline sulfate (an antiseptic), it\u2019s definitely gooey. Yet it clings to my lips not just for an hour or so, like other lip balms, but definitely overnight. $10 at Amazon Buy $8 at Walmart Buy\n\nSheet mask\n\nSoo'AE Hemp Dreams Sheet Mask On other non-glycolic nights, I\u2019ll put on a sheet mask. Certain beauty addicts wear them on long-haul red-eyes \u2014 hey, why not? The lights are out \u2014 but I wear mine for 20 minutes shortly before bedtime. Once I peel it off, I smoosh in the residue, letting it absorb overnight. Sheet masks are all about occlusion \u2014 trapping a nurturing, moisturizing, or revitalizing formula on the skin to increase its efficacy. The Soo\u2019AE Hemp Dreams Sheet Mask is one that really stays put and never remotely feels as though it\u2019s about to drip. I\u2019ve yet to decide how I feel about its title ingredient, hemp, derived from cannabis. It may help with moisturization. But this mask also has hydrating coconut extract, plus allantoin, for simulating collagen production, and eucalyptus and pine extract, which give the skin a gentle kick. After about ten minutes on my face, it begins feeling effervescent. Nice! $3 at CVS Buy\n\nEye cream\n\nFace Stockholm Seaweed Eye Cream Eyelid skin is too damn delicate for its own good. Yet there\u2019s so little of it, you think \u2026 how hard can it be to keep it refreshed? Very. But the Face Stockholm Seaweed Eye Cream does an amazingly good job at keeping that lid skin dewy, maybe because it contains what may be an ideal blend of soothing, gel-like seaweed extract, cucumber extract (high in water content), and neem-leaf extract (a hydration booster). With this one, I wake up with eyelids that don\u2019t scare me when I touch them. $36 at Face Stockholm Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
