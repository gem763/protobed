Pompeo With Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday", "language": "en", "text": "QUESTION: Joining us now to discuss all this and more, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, it\u2019s great to be back on. Thanks for having me on the show this morning.\n\nQUESTION: Let\u2019s start with the President\u2019s tweet late last night that he has called off the meeting, canceled the meeting with the Taliban that was to be held at Camp David today, a secret meeting, and that he has called off all peace talks, negotiations with the Taliban. Where does that leave the plan to begin to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Chris, remember the principles. President Trump has made clear he wants to reduce risk to Americans. You showed the pictures last night from the dignified transfer of the remains of Sergeant First Class Barreto. I was out there with his family. It\u2019s a reminder to all of us of the enormous cost and sacrifice these heroes make for us each and every day. President Trump is trying to reduce that risk.\n\nAt the same time, he is committed to making sure that we reduce the risk that terror should ever strike the United States from Afghanistan again. And so we\u2019ve been working for months for a peace and reconciliation deal. We\u2019ve been working with the Afghan Government, working with other Afghan leaders, been working with the Taliban, to try and reduce the level of violence, to commence \u2013 and you would know this, Chris, well. We\u2019ve been trying to get the Afghans to talk to each other, this basic idea, for almost two decades now.\n\nWe had the Taliban\u2019s commitment to do that. We had their commitment to break from al-Qaida, publicly. And they would obviously have to deliver on that commitment. So we\u2019ve made real progress, but in the end the Taliban overreached. They forgot that America is always going to protect its interests, that commander \u2013 the commander of Resolute Support and the NATO forces there are still at this hard. We killed over a thousand Taliban just in the last 10 days. And while this isn\u2019t a war of attrition, the American people should know we will continue to apply the appropriate pressure to make sure that we are never struck with terror again from Afghanistan.\n\nQUESTION: So are the talks now dead, and what will it take to restart them?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Well, for the time being, they are. We\u2019ve recalled \u2014\n\nQUESTION: They\u2019re dead.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: We\u2019ve recalled Ambassador Khalilzad to come back to Washington so that we can begin to think about how we would chart the path forward. And I think \u2013 and although the President hasn\u2019t made a final decision, look, what they did here was they tried to use terror to improve their negotiating position. And I think anyone who has observed President Trump knows, whether it was in Hanoi with North Korea, or whether it\u2019s been in how we responded when the Chinese reneged on their commitment in the trade deals; if, in the course of a conversation where we\u2019re trying to improve both teams\u2019 outcomes through a negotiated solution, if the other team commits an act that\u2019s inconsistent with that, President Trump is not going to take that deal. He\u2019s not going to take a bad deal. We\u2019re looking for more than words on paper. We\u2019re looking for real delivered commitment. And the Taliban demonstrated either that they weren\u2019t willing to or couldn\u2019t live up to the commitment they needed to make to reduce violence there.\n\nQUESTION: So the talks are off indefinitely?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: I hope we get them started back. It will ultimately be up to the Taliban. They have got to demonstrate that they are prepared to do the things that we asked them to do in the course of those negotiations.\n\nQUESTION: But the Taliban, as David Spunt just reported, has just come out with a statement.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Yeah, a lot of people bluster, Chris. There\u2019s \u2013 those words \u2013 cooler heads, I hope, will prevail. I didn\u2019t see the full statement. I don\u2019t know its context. I don\u2019t know precisely who issued this. It\u2019s the case that the Taliban is not monolithic.\n\nQUESTION: But let me just say they said Americans will suffer more than anyone else and that this will result in the death of more American troops.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: I hope that\u2019s not the case. We don\u2019t want any loss of American life. Know this: Know that our Department of Defense and General Miller have the full authority to do what they need to do to protect American soldiers, sailors, Air Force folks working in the area, and do everything they need to do to prevent a terror attack from ever coming back to the United States, as it did now almost 18 years ago.\n\nQUESTION: I want to get to the bigger question. Who thought it was a good idea for the President of the United States \u2013 you had an agreement in principle already, your envoy meeting with Taliban leaders in Qatar. Fine. Who thought it was a good idea for the President of the United States to meet with Taliban leaders, who have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands, just three days before 9/11?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: We know the history of Camp David. We reflected on that as we were thinking about how to deliver for the American people. And so as we considered the right path forward, your point about an agreement in principle \u2013 I think that\u2019s true. We weren\u2019t complete. There were still lots of implementation issues, lots of technical issues that needed to be worked on, even though we\u2019d been doing this for months. President Trump ultimately made the decision. He said: I want to talk to President Ghani. I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators. I want to look them in the eye. I want to see if we can get to the final outcome that we needed so that we could sign off on that deal, so we found that arrangement acceptable, that the verification was adequate. And we concluded this was a perfectly appropriate place. You know the history of Camp David. Lots of bad folks have come through that place. There have been lots of peace negotiations taken place. It\u2019s almost always the case, Chris, that you don\u2019t get to negotiate with good guys. The reason you\u2019re in negotiations to end wars, to end conflict, to end violence, to reduce risks to the American people, is almost always because the person across the table from you isn\u2019t exactly the finest.\n\nQUESTION: Well, I understand that. I don\u2019t want to press the point too much, but Yasser Arafat was there, and obviously, he was responsible with the Palestinian Liberation Organization for the death of many people.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Many, many Americans.\n\nQUESTION: But the Taliban has the \u2013 had the death of thousands of Americans, and it\u2019s just three days before 9/11. No concerns about that? And I guess my question is I can understand the envoy talking to him. Why does the President have to confer that status on them?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: President Trump was very clear. He wanted to make sure we got to the right place. He has always been someone \u2013 I\u2019ve observed this now for my entire time working for him, as CIA director and now as Secretary of State. He is willing to take risks if he believes he can deliver a good outcome for the American people. He was hopeful that this conversation would lead \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve been at this now almost two decades, Chris, $30 billion a year, and we\u2019ve got terror risks all across the world, not just in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve got to make sure we have the forces postured right all across the world.\n\nWe sometimes singularly focus on Afghanistan because of its deep history and deep connection and what they did on 9/11 that sill angers me to this very moment, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we get it right. And our efforts over the last months have been to do that. President Trump has been very clear about our mission set, and I hope we\u2019ll get the opportunity to continue to head down that path so that we can get the reduction in violence and we can get the Taliban to make a commitment and then live up to it to break with al-Qaida, and that we can get them back at the negotiating table with their Afghan brothers and sisters to reduce the level of violence there.\n\nQUESTION: Iran just announced that it is going to use advanced centrifuges that will allow it to enrich uranium faster. This is at least the third \u2013 I don\u2019t have to tell you \u2013 the third violation of the nuclear deal that they have made in recent months. All of these are shortening the time that Iran would need to build an atomic weapon, a nuclear weapon, to less than a year. Is the threat of a nuclear Iran increasing? And given the fact U.S. sanctions have hammered the economy but they\u2019re not stopping Iran in this area, what\u2019s the U.S. going to do about it?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Well, Chris, we hope the whole world will join us. President Trump has been very clear. Iran won\u2019t have a nuclear weapon on our watch. We\u2019ll stop it. He\u2019s made clear we\u2019re prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure that that\u2019s the case.\n\nThe challenge is, of course, we came in after the previous administration had given the Islamic Republic of Iran, the ayatollah, given him billions of dollars in economic wealth with which to build these very programs. And as you see, Chris, they can turn them back on like that. One of the central failures of the JCPOA is that whatever limits there were could be turned back on in a minute. We see this, right? They make an announcement; the next thing you know, they\u2019re spinning centrifuges at higher and higher enrichment rates. This was a crazy failed deal.\n\nAnd so our approach has been very different: build out alliances with the Gulf states, with Israel, with all the partners around the world who understand the threat of nuclear weapons inside of the Middle East, inside of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and to reduce their capacity to execute that. And we\u2019ve done it. We can see it with Hizballah. They have fewer resources. We can see it with the Shia militias in Iraq. They\u2019re scrambling for resources. We think the Iranian Government will shrink, that their GDP will shrink by as much as 12 or 14 percent this year. This will reduce their capacity to purchase the things they need, the equipment they need, the materials they need, to inflict terror around the world. That\u2019s President Trump\u2019s approach. I think we\u2019ve been very successful so far.\n\nQUESTION: President Trump talks about the possibility of meeting with Iranian President Rouhani, possibly at the UN General Assembly later this month. Here he is: \u201cTheir inflation is at a number that few people have ever seen inflation at, and it\u2019s a very sad situation. They could solve it very quickly. We could solve it in 24 hours. But we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nBut Rouhani says no meeting until all U.S. sanctions are lifted first, and President Trump says there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen. What do you put the odds of a Trump-Rouhani summit this month at the UN?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: I\u2019ll leave that to the folks in Vegas. Here\u2019s how I know we\u2019ll think about it. President Trump will think about whether it\u2019s appropriate to meet based on whether he thinks we can get an improved outcome for the American people. He has said he\u2019d meet with him with no preconditions. I know the to\u2019s and fro\u2019s inside the Iranian Government: There are those who think it\u2019s wise to meet; there are those who just want to continue to kill people around the world.\n\nWe need to make sure that we\u2019re doing all we can to make those that understand that the revolutionary nature of the Iranian regime is unacceptable, that they\u2019ve got to change their behavior, and that America will never permit them to have a nuclear weapon, those inside of Iran that understand that, and I think that\u2019s the majority of the Iranian people as well. Those are the folks who we want to make sure and talk to so that we ultimately get the right outcome. We want a successful Iran. We want them to be part of the community of nations. You can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re building missiles that threaten Europe, threaten Israel, and building out systems that could ultimately create a nuclear weapon.\n\nQUESTION: Finally, you spoke at Kansas State University on Friday, which did not exactly dampen speculation that you might run for the Senate next year, which has been, obviously, talked about. In fact, Jerry Moran, the other senator \u2013 not the seat that you would be going for potentially \u2013 had talked about the prospects of you running the other day. Here he is: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised but what he would enter that race, and I think he would be a good, solid candidate that would be \u2013 have a lot of support in Kansas.\u201d\n\nSo you have Jerry Moran\u2019s endorsement. Someone said the other day that you have gone recently from no to no comment. You certainly are not shutting the door.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Well, that was very kind of Senator Moran. I appreciate the vote of confidence, and I know he was trying to be incredibly helpful, as is Senator McConnell.\n\nQUESTION: Who says you\u2019re his number one choice.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Let\u2019s be very clear. I have given the same message for the entire time I\u2019ve been asked about this. The only people who ask me about this are folks like you, Chris, and that\u2019s just fine. I\u2019m focused on what I\u2019m doing every day. So long as President Trump wants me to be his Secretary of State, that\u2019s what I am intent upon. I\u2019ve given this a lot less thought than it sounds like lots of others may have.\n\nQUESTION: Okay, one last question in this regard, and then I\u2019ll let it go. Because I know that that\u2019s what you always say: Well, I want to do what President Trump wants me to do. What if President Trump comes to you, because of Jerry Moran, because of Mitch McConnell, early next spring and says, you know what, the most important thing you could do for me is to run for the Senate, is to hold the Senate Republican majority? Then what would you do?\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Goodness knows, Chris. I mean, I literally \u2013 these are impossible to answer because I spend \u2013 as you can see, I spend every waking moment trying to deliver American diplomacy around the world. I\u2019m going to keep doing that so long as I\u2019m doing this, and we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see what life brings when the next thing in life approaches.\n\nQUESTION: And we want to thank you, and for honoring the service of Sergeant Barreto. We all hold him in our hearts, and we all hold the hearts of his family. You told me his dad was in the military, other relatives in the military. A terrible loss.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Chris, thank you. It was a terrible loss. Thank you for honoring him by bringing this back up. He is a true patriot, and his family have sacrificed so much for our great country.\n\nQUESTION: Secretary Pompeo, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with you.\n\nSECRETARY POMPEO: Thank you, sir.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cropped-Seal-of-the-U.S.-Department-of-State-32x32.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
