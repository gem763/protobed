Once viewed as the primary threat to Cisco Systems \u2019 dominant position in the networking equipment business, the company has struggled to grow: Revenues in 2018 were down 8% and flat with 2014.\n\nBut Needham analyst Alex Henderson sees reasons for optimism. On Monday, he raised his rating on Juniper (ticker: JNPR) to Buy from Hold, setting a target of $29 for the stock price. Shares were up 45 cents, or 1.9%, to $24.31 in afternoon trading, though the stock was still down more than 7% year to date.\n\nHenderson wrote in a research note that he came away from a recent visit with management thinking that the dynamics of the optical networking market \u201cmay give [Juniper] some renewed life after several years of persistent declines.\u201d He thinks the company will stabilize its financial results in the third quarter, returning to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2020, aided by a rebound in cloud spending.\n\nA return to growth in the fourth quarter could give the stock a lift, he said.\n\nThe Needham analyst noted that Juniper posted mid-teen percentage declines in revenue in each of the last two fourth quarters. \u201cAgainst one of the worst prints in a long time [in last year\u2019s fourth quarter] the comparison looks to be relatively easy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOver the past three years, Juniper\u2019s earnings have been hurt by a product-mix shift toward lower-cost networking gear used by cloud networks, but the move has now run its course, he said.\n\nHe also noted what while cloud-spending levels this year have been a challenge for even the best companies in networking and optical hardware, commentary from Cisco (CSCO), Juniper, and Arista Networks (ANET) suggests a stronger year in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t tend to play washed out technology stocks,\u201d Henderson wrote. \u201cWe have been a long-term bear on Juniper, believing its exposure to routing and persistent cost and growth pressures represent significant challenges both near-term and long term. The stock has languished for a number of years even as Juniper has executed buybacks and large restructurings. Numbers have been pretty flat and the company has struggled to breach the $2 per share in earnings mark.\u201d\n\nNow, though, the \u201cvaluation looks washed out,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cJuniper has several opportunities to get back on track.\u201d\n\nWrite to Eric J.
