Elect all of the Democratic candidates", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-27", "text": "In July, CNN made the decision to treat the Democratic debates like entertainment. It was a sporting event, with an inane WWF style-introduction designed to play up \u201cin-fighting\u201d between the candidates. \u201cTonight,\u201d the \u201cin-a-world\u201d movie trailer announcer began, \u201ca fight for the heart of the Party.

It would have been laughable if it weren\u2019t so bad for our nation.\n\nThen it got worse. The moderators were clearly more interested in getting the candidates to fight against one another than they were in facilitating a true discussion of the issues and outlining what\u2019s at stake in the 2020 election.\n\nIn the very first question of the second night, Dana Bash Dana BashScott: White House and FEMA 'convinced me there's plenty of money' for Dorian response Alyssa Milano: The key to beating Trump?

It was a sad attempt to reignite the drama between the two from the first debate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just them, and it wasn\u2019t just that night. Normally respectable journalists have become provocateurs, apparently more beholden to the whims of their programming director and potential viral videos than their own history of quality journalism or the good of our country.\n\nNone of this might matter if this was a normal election against a normal president and electorate, but it is not and we must stop acting like it is.\n\nDespite the media\u2019s best effort to normalize this administration by cashing in on the entertainment value of the spectacle, Donald Trump Donald John Trump Poll: 40 percent of voters don't think Trump will win reelection Mattis: 'I'll speak out' about policy issues 'when the time comes' China contests Trump claim it is fentanyl source MORE seemingly thrives in this conflict and so do his voters. He basks in chants at rallies that validate his policies. And to make matters worse, there is evidence that Russia is trying to amplify the dissent of the Democratic primary, to the benefit of Trump. Which is what the Kremlin did during the Sanders-Clinton primary, to devastating effect.\n\nThe answer to defeating him, then, cannot be in politics as usual, or surrendering to entropy, division, and the whims of Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinNetanyahu, Trump discussing diplomatic gesture before Israeli election: report Media takes hits in bitter partisan era Protests in Russia may show more than what we're ready to see MORE\u2019s seeming propaganda.\n\nIf we want to get rid of Trump and his administration, we should not focus on electing one candidate. We should elect them all.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is a Democratic dream team currently running for a single position. Like the party itself \u2014 and like the nation as a whole \u2014 this slate of candidates has a diversity of background, experience and thought. Instead of fighting against one another, they should pledge, right now before the next debate, to form a unity ticket under any eventual nominee.\n\nIf they let go of their own egos and band together to fight Trump; spoke in unison about the Democratic vision for America; and refused to succumb to the conflict narratives media outlets are all too ready to encourage. They would be unstoppable.\n\nImagine this: Vice President Biden is currently leading the field, so let\u2019s start there. With Biden at the top and a Harris vice presidency we would speak to the majority of Americans who prefer Biden to any other candidate.\n\nAt the same time, we would bring the perspective of a new generation of leaders to the highest offices in the land. Attorney General Cory Booker could take on the NRA and the racial injustices he so often faced as mayor of Newark.\n\nElizabeth Warren could lead the Department of Education and it would transform our nation for generations. Bernie Sanders playing the role, as Secretary of Health and Human Services would ensure every person in America could access health care we could afford.\n\nIn any administration, Julian Castro Julian CastroCastro releases climate plan West Texas mass shooting reignites gun control debate Progressive group no longer considering Harris for endorsement MORE\u2019s experience as a cabinet secretary and Congressman would be the perfect antidote to the Trump regime\u2019s border policy as the first Latinx Homeland Security Secretary.\n\nBut it needn\u2019t stop there.

MORE say no to the critical role of Secretary of State if this unified group asked her to serve? Our reputation and luster around the globe would be instantly restored. If Biden doesn\u2019t win the nomination, he would be a world-class leader in nearly any other department. Swap him out for anyone else.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that these candidates all agree on the \u201cwhat.\u201d Their generally minor differences are in the \u201chow.\u201d Instead of encouraging the cult of personalities surrounding each individual candidate, reaping the division this long and damaging primary will sow, let\u2019s get behind them all. We truly have an embarrassment of riches in our field. We should not be winnowing it. We should be uniting it, pooling their resources and creating a complete ticket that no American could vote against.\n\nThe Democratic Party is progressive. The Democratic Party is moderate. And like America, the Democratic Party is diverse. This slate of candidates represents the breadth of the American experience and the excitement of new ideas and perspectives.\n\nThese are desperate times. The heart and soul of our nation is at stake. Our country cannot afford another four years of Donald Trump. Desperate times call for thinking outside the box with Democratic measures. If we want to beat Trump, we know whom to elect: All of them.\n\nOr we can just keep proceeding with politics as usual and act shocked when he\u2019s re-elected.\n\nAlyssa Milano is an actor, activist and recently joined the ERA Coalition\u2019s Advisory Council.
