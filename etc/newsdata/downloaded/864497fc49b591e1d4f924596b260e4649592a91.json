Ilhan Omar (D-MN) came under fire earlier this year for refusing to say terrorists carried out the horrific attacks that took place on September 11, 2001. During a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Omar said \"some people did something.\"\n\n\u201cI say raise hell, make people uncomfortable. Because here\u2019s the truth. For far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of living as second class citizens and I\u2019m tired of it,\" Omar said during the event. \u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognize that some people did something, and then all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that killed almost 3,000 innocent Americans, Omar decided to change her tune and walk back her previous comments.\n\nThe Congresswoman took to Twitter to call what took place a \"terror attack.\"\n\nSeptember 11th was an attack on all of us.\n\n\n\nWe will never forget the thousands of Americans who lost their lives in the largest terror attack on U.S. soil.\n\n\n\nI will continue to fight to make sure we care for the first responders and families who lost loved ones. #NeverForget \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) September 11, 2019\n\nWhile many Americans would love to believe that Omar is being absolutely authentic when she says a terror attack took place, let's call this what this really is: political pandering. If Omar had a sudden awakening and realized that what she said was wrong, she wouldn't have waited 6 months and made the proclamation on the anniversary of the attacks. She would have been apologetic sooner.\n\nShe wouldn't have to be blasted by a 9/11 survivor during a ceremony in New York City. She would have came to the realization on her own, months ago.\n\nThis is just a cheap public relations move to smooth things over. But Americans will never forget those brave men and women who lost their lives...or Omar's despicable comments.", "description": "Geez..09/12/2019 3:08:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/106/e9608f14-d7a5-453a-89de-f64c43347f10.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
