If approved by the state\u2019s legislature, the plan would be the first of its kind in the United States.\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, formally introduced the initiative \u2014 which she described as a \u201cmoonshot for higher education\u201d \u2014 at an education summit in Albuquerque on Wednesday.\n\nThe program would help cover \u201c100% of undergraduate tuition\u201d at New Mexico\u2019s 29 public colleges and universities for some 55,000 students annually, Lujan Grisham\u2019s office said. The program \u2014 dubbed the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship \u2014 is estimated to cost the state between $25 million and $35 million every year.\n\nNew Mexico is hoping to make college tuition free for all state residents looking to attend its public institutions in the first plan of its kind in the U.S. https://t.co/piJ0NkPNVJ pic.twitter.com/GAkVjvpu86 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 18, 2019\n\nLujan Grisham\u2019s announcement at the New Mexico Higher Education Summit was met with a standing ovation and applause, CNN reported.\n\n\u201cIt means better enrollment. It means better student success,\u201d the governor said in a statement of the program. \u201cIn the long run, it means economic growth, improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and thinkers and parents. It means a better trained and better compensated workforce.\u201d\n\nThe ambitious plan will first need to be approved by the state\u2019s Democratic-controlled legislature, which will also need to decide how to appropriate the funds needed for the program.\n\nSome of the money will come from existing federal grants and scholarships that already cover some students\u2019 tuition; but it remains unclear where the remaining resources will come from. The New York Times said the state plans to use its growing oil production revenues to defray some of the costs.\n\nSara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Philadelphia\u2019s Temple University who studies higher education costs, said she was confident that New Mexico\u2019s plan could \u201cpay for itself.\u201d\n\nThe program has a high return on investment, she told NPR, adding: \u201cRight now [New Mexico is] losing talented people dropping out of college because their families are too rich to be able to qualify for the [federal] Pell grant and too poor to be able to finish college, that\u2019s economically inefficient. You want those people to get their credentials and get out into the workforce.\u201d\n\nAs NPR noted, New Mexico has one of the highest poverty rates in the United States \u2015 and also one of the lowest rates of college participation among low-income students.\n\nA January study found that the college participation rate for students from low-income families is only 22% in New Mexico; the national average is 34%.\n\nLujan Grisham said the introduction of the higher education plan in New Mexico would be \u201can absolute game-changer\u201d for the state.\n\n\u201cHigher education in this state, a victim of the recession, has been starved in recent years,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are pivoting to a robust reinvestment in higher learning \u2014 specifically and directly in our students. By covering the last dollar of tuition and fees, by making college significantly more accessible to New Mexicans of every income, of every background, of every age, we are putting students first.\u201d\n\nNot everyone, however, is convinced.\n\nRepublican state Rep. David Gallegos lambasted the plan as not \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do we take the money from? Public safety? Public education? I just don\u2019t know where we continue the money,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham wants to provide state residents with free tuition to public colleges, a plan that, if passed by the state legislature, would add New Mexico to the growing list of Democratic-led states to offer free higher education https://t.co/7padBQRxN7 pic.twitter.com/FPLP1rinfL \u2014 CNN (@CNN) September 19, 2019\n\nAs concerns mount nationwide about the rising costs of higher education and the crippling student debt saddling millions of Americans, several states have introduced programs to make it easier for some students to attend college.\n\nCiting data by the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Times reported that, as of last year, 17 states had programs offering free tuition \u2015 mostly at 2-year colleges \u2015 to at least some students.\n\nIn 2017, New York became the first U.S. state to make tuition free for two- and four-year public colleges for students from low- and middle-income families.\n\nLast month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation to provide first-time, full-time students in the state free tuition for two years of community college.", "description": "The initiative, announced Wednesday by Gov.
