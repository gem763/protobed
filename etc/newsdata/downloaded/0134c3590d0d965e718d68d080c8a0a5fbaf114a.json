Committee on the Rights of the Child submitted its concluding observations this week after evaluating national reports from Seoul\u2019s health and welfare ministry, Newsis reported Friday.\n\nThe U.N. group gave high marks for South Korea\u2019s legislation affecting refugees, child abuse, and the state budget allocated toward victimized children. The committee also endorsed South Korea\u2019s strengthening of penalties for child-related sex offenses and expanding parental leave for fathers and single parents, according to the report.\n\nBut the U.N. committee also said South Korea\u2019s budget to address the needs of economically marginalized, disabled or migrant children is relatively low compared to its GDP. Korea is a member of the OECD group of developed countries.\n\nThe international agency said high rates of domestic child abuse, relatively high child suicide rates and \u201cexcessive competition\u201d at school are sources of concern.\n\nSouth Korea is required to submit a national report to the U.N. by December 2024 on child welfare, and is expected to take measures that reflect U.N. recommendations. Seoul is planning to hold discussions on Nov. 20 ahead of drafting a Second Basic Plan for Child Policy for the years 2020-24, according to Newsis.\n\nDomestic child abuse in South Korea has become a source of increasing concern in the country.\n\nLast week, a man was charged with murdering his 5-year-old stepson using cruel means, including tying the child with a rope in their home, local television network KBS reported Friday.\n\nThe father was believed to have acted alone, but the boy\u2019s biological mother is also being charged with neglect. She had previously denied any wrongdoing, according to the report.", "description": "Oct. 4 (UPI) \u2014 South Korea is under criticism from a United Nations committee for not doing enough to curb domestic child abuse and encouraging", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
