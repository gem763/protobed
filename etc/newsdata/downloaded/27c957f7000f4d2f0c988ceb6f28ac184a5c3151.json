Starting November 12, Disney+ will have more than 300 movies available right away.\n\nThere are some cartoon go-tos, like Finding Nemo, and even a new live-action version of Lady & the Tramp starring Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux. If a throwback is more your style, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is also on there to remind Disney fans of the company\u2019s 1990s obsession with absent-minded scientists (never forget Robin Williams' Flubber).\n\nDisney movies, on the whole, are a good deep dive into the heavy stuff millennials were taking in at a young age. Sure, divorce is something many kids were likely familiar with, but how about an unrealistic yet charming telling of two long-lost identical twin sisters who reunite their parents on a boat they rented? Child therapists were likely fielding questions over that one for generations. And don't forget Bambi and the casual killing of a mother deer. We were just supposed to take that in and move on? Good luck with that. Nothing is more fun than revisiting things like that as a fully grown adult and experiencing a good, cathartic cry.\n\nWith that, enjoy Disney+.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BH9hzW4TVQTYCmhWiV1PiQ--~B/aD03MDA7dz0xNDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/2a5b0135db5d9f7e9118873fbcca66b5", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
