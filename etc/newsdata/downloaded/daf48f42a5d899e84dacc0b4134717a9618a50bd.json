You can't be 2-0 up at home to palace and draw. Emery I've backed you but bro, enough is enough. Xhaka can f*ck himself as well. Never wanna see him in an arsenal top again!! #AFC #EmiratesStadium #TimesUp'.\n\nThe Frenchman, who has just returned from an ankle injury, has since removed his like on the social media post.\n\nEmery is set to discuss the Arsenal captaincy with club officials after Xhaka's misconduct, and it will be interesting to see how the Spaniard responds to Lacazette's act of defiance.\n\nGranit Xhaka was jeered off the pitch as Arsenal searched for a winner against Crystal Palace\n\nOn Xhaka's misdemeanour, Emery said: 'It's not the moment to speak about that because first I want to speak with him and the club.\n\n'We need to stay calm but, really, he was wrong.'\n\nEmery refused to criticise Arsenal fans for sarcastically applauding and booing their captain - instead insisting Xhaka should have dealt with the situation with a cooler head.\n\n'We are here because we have supporters. We are the workers inside the club but we play for them.\n\n'We need to have a lot of respect for them when they are applauding us but also when they are criticising us.'", "description": "Alexandre Lacazette has liked an Instagram post criticising Arsenal manager Unai Emery and club captain Granit Xhaka after the 2-2 home draw with Crystal Palace.", "authors": ["Tom Caldon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/00/20261802-0-image-a-10_1572223545455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
