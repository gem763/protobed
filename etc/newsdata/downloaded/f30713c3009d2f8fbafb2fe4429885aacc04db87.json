Nearby investigators found a metal pipe they believe was used as a weapon, Chief of Detectives Michael Baldassano said at a news conference Saturday morning. The suspect, who Baldassano said also appeared to be homeless, was being treated as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d at this point in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThe motive right now seems to be random attacks,\u201d said Baldassano, who oversees investigations for south Manhattan, noting that race or age did not appear to play a part in the crime. Police say the men were sleeping when they were attacked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe surviving victim had been transported to a nearby hospital in \u201cpretty serious condition,\u201d Baldassano said.\n\nAs with most major U.S. cities, homelessness is one of the most hotly debated issues in the nation\u2019s largest. Tens of thousands of people experience homelessness there each year, and the problem has reached heights not seen since the Great Depression, according to the advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless. In August, over 61,000 people stayed in New York City homeless shelters each night, including over 21,000 children, according to the coalition\u2019s data.\n\nAs news of the Saturday attacks spread, the Coalition for the Homeless called for New York to build more affordable and subsidized housing to help people transition out of homelessness.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe callous attack against five homeless men last night is unfathomable in its brutality,\" Giselle Routhier, policy director for Coalition for the Homeless, said in a statement. \u201cFour men lost their lives and one is fighting to survive. It should serve as a reminder to all of us that our homeless neighbors live without the protection and privacy of a home. They are our fellow human beings and deserve the dignity and safety that a home assures.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nJournalist says a CBP officer withheld his passport until he agreed he writes \u2018propaganda\u2019\n\nFirst he stole from the elderly.
