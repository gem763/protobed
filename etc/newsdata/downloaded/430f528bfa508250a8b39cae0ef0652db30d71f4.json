According to public readouts released by the White House, Trump last spoke to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Sep. 5.\n\nShawn Thew/EPA via Shutterstock, FILE\n\nThe official confirmed, as first reported by the New York Times, that Trump followed through on Barr\u2019s request in a call to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\n\n\u201cAs the Department of Justice has previously announced, a team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating the origins of the U.S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.\n\n\"At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials,\u201d she said.\n\nThe official would not say what other countries Barr has asked for the president's assistance in initiating contact with, but downplayed the requests as common and disputed any notion that Barr would want the president to pressure foreign leaders.\n\nBut it's not clear whether there's any other example of the country's lead law enforcement official traveling overseas to personally investigate an issue that the president believes could benefit him politically.\n\n\u201cThe Australian Government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\" an Australian government spokesman said. \"The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President.\u201d\n\nBarr has characterized his review as looking into the origins of the counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign in 2016, and in May announced he had tasked Durham of Connecticut to oversee the review.\n\nBarr's conduct has been under heightened scrutiny in recent days after a transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy showed that Trump told the Ukraine leader at least five times that he would task Barr with assisting him in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as with Barr's review of the Russia investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department has denied that Barr and Trump ever went on to have any conversation on Ukraine. But Democrats have expressed outrage over the conduct, which they say suggests the president was prepared to try and task the country's lead law enforcement official with pushing forward an investigation into his political opponent.\n\nThe Justice Department also revealed last week that it had declined to open a criminal probe into President Trump over the call following a referral from the Director of National Intelligence Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\nBarr has in the past faced criticism from Democrats who have said the Attorney General is acting as Trump's \"protector,\" a criticism that Barr has rebuked in the past.", "description": "Attorney General William Barr asked President Trump to provide introductions to the leaders of Italy and Australia as part of review into the origins of the Russia probe.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/william-barr-file-epa-jef-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
