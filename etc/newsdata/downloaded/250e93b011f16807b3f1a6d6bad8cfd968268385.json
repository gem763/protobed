But, they warned, the coming election would be brutal \u2013 and may end up not resolving anything.\n\n\u201cHurrah! Something has moved within the walls of the palace of Westminster,\u201d cheered France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cThe British parliament has finally agreed on \u2026 no, not Brexit, that would be too easy. But on snap elections, to be held on 12 December.\u201d\n\nThe paper noted that after another day of \u201cbarely comprehensible developments\u201d, parliament would now be dissolved on 5 November, \u201cthe day the skies light up with bonfires and fireworks in memory of an earlier attempt to blow it up\u201d.\n\nLet battle commence: how the parties are shaping up for December's election Read more\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan was to return to Westminster \u201cwith a comfortable majority, which will allow him to get his Brexit deal through parliament and therefore Britain to leave the EU on 31 January\u201d, the paper said. \u201cBut it is a big bet.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, it added, these elections \u201cwill be won or lost on the question of Brexit. But will the British make a clear choice? Nothing is less sure. The risk of a new hung parliament is very real. In which case, all options remain open.\u201d\n\nLe Monde said Johnson\u2019s election bid \u201cworked at the fourth try\u201d. The prime minister had \u201crisked complete and utter paralysis, without a parliamentary majority and with a freshly negotiated deal meeting more and more resistance from MPs\u201d, it said.\n\n\u201cBut will the elections help Johnson regain the Conservatives\u2019 lost majority? And above all: will they help the country out of its Brexit impasse?\u201d If the Tories win, Britain could be out of the EU even before 31 January, Le Monde said.\n\n\u201cBut Labour has promised to renegotiate the deal and put it to a second referendum, and the Lib Dems to cancel Brexit entirely \u2026 In a country so deeply divided and fed up with Brexit, nothing is certain. The nightmare would be another hung parliament.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s Die Zeit rejoiced that at long last, \u201cthe House of Commons has reached a decision for something, rather than against\u201d. But, the paper said, \u201cas welcome as it is, the coming elections may solve nothing. The campaign will be hard and relentless, and rarely has it been so difficult to predict the outcome.\u201d\n\nStuck with his broken promise that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, Johnson will not be able to seek consensus, the paper predicted, noting that \u201cthe ability to compromise has been lost in Britain because of Brexit\u201d.\n\nInstead, the prime minister will lead \u201ca highly populist election campaign pitting the people, who finally want to see Brexit implemented and are represented by Johnson, against the elitist parliament that keeps stopping him \u2026 The 2016 referendum showed how dirty such campaigns can become.\u201d\n\nDie Welt also predicted an ugly election. \u201cAll the polls put the Tories ahead,\u201d the paper noted. \u201cAnd Johnson can say he has a deal in his pocket, while Jeremy Corbyn only offers lingering uncertainty. The prime minister will be confrontational and a brutal campaign of dirty tricks can be expected.\u201d\n\nBut, the paper said, it is a high stakes gamble. \u201cBrexit is the defining question of the election. So it is the Brexit \u201cextremists\u201d who could prove dangerous for Johnson: the Liberal Democrats, who want to reverse Brexit, and Nigel Farage and his Brexit party who want a no deal. They could cost Johnson a majority.\u201d\n\nIn the Netherlands, De Volkskrant agreed the campaign was likely to prove \u201cthe hardest, dirtiest, and most polarised in modern British history \u2026 In Dominic Cummings, the Tories have a strategist who will not shy away from underhand tactics. Among the Corbynistas, there is deep-rooted hatred of Johnson\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds said none of the parties could be sure how they would do, \u201cbut the general conviction that there is no other way to escape the country\u2019s Brexit\u2019s paralysis ended up outweighing any doubts\u201d. All knew, however, that the vote \u201cwill surely be a de facto second referendum on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU\u201d.\n\nIn Sweden, Svenska Dagbladet said Johnson was \u201crisking everything in a historic winter vote\u201d. On the day the prime minister \u201clooked certain to get his parliamentary election\u201d, the paper noted, \u201cthe Tories were leading in the polls, just as they did before the 2017 vote. Then, they lost big.\u201d\n\nThe Irish Times said elections were not usually fought on single issues, their results tending to emerge \u201cfrom the nation\u2019s prevailing mood; the aggregation of attack and counterattack lines; and the holistic policy platform of each party\u201d. So one thing was certain: \u201cBritain\u2019s Brexit election will be like no other before it.\u201d", "description": "Irish Times says \u2018Brexit election\u2019 will be like no other while El Pa\u00eds calls it \u2018second referendum\u2019", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d641f3af04ca7a239613587d5bfb5117492fd2/0_85_2917_1750/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78ad415f59007844bc9638acbf5da0a6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
