And while saving enough to pay for a trip might seem like a lofty goal, there\u2019s a handy hack to help get you there.\n\nIf you\u2019re daunted by the task of saving for a vacation, here\u2019s how to use a travel savings account to trick yourself into adding more money and bringing that faraway locale closer to reality.\n\nThe hack: Name your travel account\n\nMost banks allow customers to rename their accounts with something custom. Choosing a name like \u201cGreat Reef Diving Trip 2020\u201d or \u201cHigh School Reunion\u201d can help you mentally cement what that money is going to be used for and why it shouldn\u2019t be touched for anything else.\n\nNaming your account serves three purposes:\n\nIt creates an initial, specific intention for your money. By setting a clearly defined goal for the funds in your account, it becomes easier to visualize where your cash is going. It\u2019s a modern version of a labeled money jar that you might keep at home, except your bank account will pay interest on your savings.\n\nAlso see: Prince Harry to launch travel sustainability initiative\n\nLeslie Tayne, a debt relief attorney and author, advises her clients to give bank accounts they create an explicit purpose and timeline.\n\n\u201cWhen you clearly define your goals and create something tangible out of the intangible, you become super focused,\u201d she said. \u201cYour mind-set coincides with your values and what you want to accomplish.\u201d\n\nIt reinforces good behavior in the future. By making your goal visible through the account name, the idea is that you\u2019ll be able to stick to it more easily in the future. If you feel tempted to withdraw your savings, seeing your travel destination upfront will remind you why you\u2019re putting money away and might encourage you to think twice about taking it out.\n\nIt promotes a more optimistic way of thinking about your finances. Naming the end result could turn negative thoughts about a seemingly insurmountable figure to save into a more motivating, can-do mind-set, with the opportunity to feel victorious after each deposit.\n\nMichelle Gielan, a positive psychology researcher and the author of \u201cBroadcasting Happiness,\u201d conducted a study with Frost Bank on the connection between optimism and financial well-being. Optimists, she says, focus on progress, not perfection. They believe their behavior matters and that every little step counts, especially when it comes to financial tasks like saving, Gielan says.\n\n\u201cWhen you give your brain a win by focusing on the smallest goal you can achieve, your brain feels compelled to accomplish more,\u201d she says.\n\nRead: The handy $29 item that travel pros say they won\u2019t take a trip without\n\nBonus hacks\n\nHere are a couple more ways to give your travel savings a boost.\n\nGo direct: One of the easiest ways to set money aside? Keep it out of sight, out of mind. Rejigger your direct deposit details at work so that part of your paycheck automatically lands in your travel savings account every pay period. If that money never hits your checking account, it\u2019ll be a lot harder to think of it as spending money.\n\nGo high-yield: If your travel plans are far off, you may want to consider opening a high-yield savings account or a cash management account to store your trip funds. These accounts offer high interest rates \u2014 2% or more \u2014 compared with the average interest rate of 0.09% of traditional savings accounts. Some of these high-interest accounts allow only electronic bank-to-bank transfers and not cash withdrawals, putting an extra barrier to accessing your money for non-travel purposes.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "A little psychology can help you set aside more money and bring that faraway locale closer to reality.", "authors": ["Chanelle Bessette"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ777_nerd_v_ZG_20190905152320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
