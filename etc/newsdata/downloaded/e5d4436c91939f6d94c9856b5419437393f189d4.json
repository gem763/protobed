I never consciously thought about it like \u201cOh, now I want to do a TV show\u201d.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t that at all. It, honestly, I just, they sent me the script, I\u2019ve read other shows, other scripts, but all eight of these were written and it was [right].\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nTalking about Living With Yourself as well as the future of cinema, he said: \u2018We all had a project where we\u2019re just telling a story, and yes it would be on TV, but people watch their movies on TV now.\n\n\u2018People watch movies on phones now. So this idea that we can tell a four-and-a-half hour movie, if you want to think about it in those terms is fine.\n\n\u2018This is an interesting character, the themes in this is really unique, I like the material, so I wanted to do it, and I\u2019m not thinking of it anywhere beyond that really. That\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarring alongside Aisling Bea as his wife Kate, Living With Yourself will see Paul return to the oddball comedy that he\u2019s become known for, as he struggles to live a double life with a twin.\n\nPaul and Aisling play a married couple in a rocky place in the new series (Picture: Netflix)\n\nAisling Bea, who stars as Miles\u2019 wife Kate in the series, was in agreement, but added that if people had an issue with the way cinema was going, then it\u2019s up to them to fix it.\n\n\u2018I think when people moan like that, it\u2019s like\u2026you have creativity to hand. If you want to change something, use your creativity,\u2019 she told us.\n\n\u2018If you feel like cinema\u2019s getting ruined, then make something people want to come and see by using your creativity. If you don\u2019t like that there\u2019s no space for your voice, then find a space where there is, or create something.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think sometimes we can, everyone is sort of like \u201cwe had it better in our day\u201d,\u2019 she continued. \u2018Every generation has that, I\u2019m sure when films first came in they were like \u201cthis is ruining theatre\u201d but plays still exist.\n\nMore: Netflix Power star teases how *that* shock character death will impact rest of season 6 finale Breaking Bad movie El Camino almost had a very different ending for Jesse Pinkman Netflix\u2019s When They See Us hit with lawsuit over interrogation technique\n\n\u2018\u201cStreaming is ruining live TV\u201d. There\u2019ll still be shows that capture attention and it\u2019s up to us as creatives to work out what will make people tick, what will make people come out of their house into a dark room rather than sit on their couch and watch something.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s kind of our job to make that,\u2019 she concluded. \u2018There\u2019ll be a bumpy period but\u2026I ain\u2019t too worried.\u2019\n\nLiving With Yourself launches this Friday on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
