Over the last two years, six states have passed laws similar to Kentucky\u2019s requiring the national motto to be displayed in schools.\n\nBut the national motto and Bible class bills \u201care like the canaries in the coal mine\u201d, said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re indicators of a larger effort, which has now been spelled out clearly in the Project Blitz strategy to ultimately reach these even more direct attacks on religious freedom,\u201d she said.\n\nProject Blitz\u2019s playbook, which is distributed to lawmakers, contains samples of cookie cutter legislation for lawmakers to introduce, as well as talking points for them to defend their positions. But in the playbook, the national motto and Bible class bills are only the first steps. Additional pieces of legislation include things like a proclamation of a Christian Heritage Week as well as legislation encouraging discrimination based on gender and sexual identity, such as a resolution \u201cestablishing public policy favoring adoption by intact, heterosexual, marriage-based families\u201d and another \u201cfavoring intimate sexual relations only between married, heterosexual couples\u201d.\n\nAmericans United says there were 76 bills inspired by Project Blitz introduced in 26 state legislatures in 2018.\n\nColin McNamara, an American Humanist Society staff attorney, calls Project Blitz \u201ca conspiracy with receipts\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s redefining religious liberty. It\u2019s weaponizing religious liberty. It\u2019s turning religious liberty into an unfettered right to discriminate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe end goal of that is by doing that, you marginalize those groups that they don\u2019t want to interact with and you entrench Christian nationalism and Christian privilege.\u201d\n\nChristian nationalism goes mainstream\n\nFor Christian nationalists, Kentucky is an attractive beachhead, a place where powerful politicians are allies and where the population can be sympathetic. This is a state where it is not uncommon for prayers to be read at high school graduations. It is a state whose Republican governor, Matt Bevin, has encouraged \u201ceach and every\u201d student in the state to participate in a \u201cBring Your Bible To School Day\u201d. It is the same Kentucky where the county clerk Kim Davis became a cause celebre for the Christian right after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2015.\n\nIn Kentucky, a Bible class bill and a national motto bill have been signed into law in recent years.\n\nNon-proselytising courses on the Bible were never forbidden in the country \u2013 and indeed, many schools in Kentucky and other states had Bible courses before any such law was passed. Kentucky\u2019s law, like others, called for the creation of state regulations for schools that wanted to offer such a course. But when these bills get signed into law, they are often painted as the end of a prohibition.\n\nIn endorsing Bible class bills this year, Trump seemed to amplify the sentiment that a prohibition was ending, tweeting: \u201cNumerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In its playbook, Project Blitz acknowledges legislation like national motto bills are meant to pave the way for more ambitious goals. Photograph: Screengrab\n\nMcNamara says people like Trump and Bevin have made Christian nationalism \u2013 \u201cthe belief that this nation is and ought to be Christian\u201d, as he puts it \u2013 mainstream at a time when white Christians are a minority in America.\n\n\u201cThat used to be something that was a fringe rightwing belief,\u201d he said. But \u201cit has become a rallying cry for the rightwing in this country now. And it\u2019s become this grand project.\u201d\n\nIn its playbook, Project Blitz acknowledges legislation like national motto bills are meant to pave the way for more ambitious goals.\n\n\u201cDespite arguments that this type of legislation is not needed, measures such as the \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 bill can have enormous impact,\u201d reads one section. \u201cEven if it does not become law, it can still provide the basis to shore up later support for other governmental entities to support religious displays.\u201d\n\nBible classes running afoul of constitution\n\nBible class laws in Kentucky and other states require the courses not proselytize or endorse or disparage any one religion. But in practice, observers say, these courses are frequently unconstitutional.\n\nAnalyzing documents obtained through open records requests in 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union found Bible classes at some Kentucky schools were tantamount to Sunday school, writing: \u201cMany public schools that offer such courses purposefully use them as vehicles to proselytize students and involve them in religious activities.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU found that some classes were using lessons and worksheets taken from Sunday school websites while others used the Bible to impart life lessons and encouraged rote memorization of biblical text.\n\nThe Barren county high school teacher Todd Steenbergen\u2019s class was flagged by the ACLU for an assignment after a trip to a museum that asked students to write a letter encouraging a friend or family member to visit the museum, focusing their letter on describing an item from a religious exhibit and \u201cwhy the reader needs to appreciate this\u201d. The class was also flagged for a worksheet the ACLU said was only testing students\u2019 knowledge of scripture without \u201cprobing any deeper into an academic or intellectual understanding of the Bible or its influences\u201d.\n\nWriting to the Guardian, Steenbergen, who is also an adviser to the high school\u2019s Fellowship of Christian Athletes group and includes a Bible quote in his email signature, said he removes his personal beliefs from the classroom. He compares how he handles the Bible class to how he handles speaking about different presidents as a history teacher.\n\n\u201cI am quite confident that I teach in a way that abides by constitutional principles,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not consider my classroom as a different venue to preach a certain message. And, I am not a fan of certain groups/people that want to make it so.\u201d\n\nTeaching a Bible class that conforms with the constitution \u201cis doable, but not easy\u201d, says Mark Chancey, a professor of religious studies at Dallas, Texas\u2019s Southern Methodist University and an expert on public school Bible classes.\n\nA lot of it comes down to training: a teacher may know the Bible, but if they have never studied it academically they could be prone to injecting their own biases and presenting parts as truth. Well-meaning teachers can also stumble upon curricula and course materials that were designed to evangelize.\n\n\u201cBut there are definitely, unfortunately, some teachers who see [Bible classes] as a trojan horse to bring in their own ideology,\u201d he said.\n\nConcerns over the constitutionality of Bible classes can weigh heavily on teachers. At Anderson County High School in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, the social studies teacher Corey Sayre pushed back against a scheduled Bible class he had volunteered to teach this year, eventually getting the school to replace it with a comparative religion class.\n\nSayre, a religious Catholic who goes to church every week, told the Guardian that while he believed he could teach the course within the confines of the constitution, it was something that would necessitate careful and constant attention. He also saw potential perils in teaching a non-devotional course.\n\n\u201cI knew that teaching this within the confines of the first amendment was going to necessitate a critical examination that most parents would not love,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that I was going to get killed from both sides.\u201d\n\nSchools push back\n\nWhen the Republican state representative Brandon Reed introduced legislation requiring \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d be posted in Kentucky public schools last year, he made it clear that it was about getting God back in school.\n\n\u201cIn a time of rampant drug use, increased school violence, and mounting cases of suicide among our youth, we need God in our schools now more than ever,\u201d he said.\n\nOne year later and the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d are now emblazoned in large, imposing letters over doorways and embossed on plaques in school lobbies.\n\nBut in some school districts, there are signs of resistance.\n\nIn Fayette county, Kentucky\u2019s second-largest school district, administrators decided to comply with the law by displaying enlarged $1 bills, which include the national motto.\n\nAt Jefferson county public schools, the state\u2019s largest district with 169 schools in the Louisville area, administrators complied with the law by hanging up small posters offering more of a history lesson than a proclamation.\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018In God We Trust\u2019 first appeared on US coins in 1864, largely because of increased religious sentiment during the civil war,\u201d small text reads on posters featuring the American flag and Statue of Liberty in the background. \u201cThe phrase later became the national motto and, in 1957, made it onto printed US bills.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the superintendent of LaRue County public schools \u2013 Reed\u2019s county and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln \u2013 told the Guardian that its schools were hanging images of oversized pennies, which feature the words \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d above Honest Abe\u2019s head.", "description": "The law now requires the words to appear in schools as conservative Christian groups seek to inject religion into public life", "authors": ["Josh Wood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb759feb46bba1e075f122e204e4d77ef6cfeea/0_256_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=468495b22a1c10e1b0ef75a338d713ec", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
