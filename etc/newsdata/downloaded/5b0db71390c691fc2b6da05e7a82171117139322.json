We\u2019re here to create a legacy,\u201d Samoa\u2019s captain, Chris Vui, said afterwards.\n\nThey will have to be a lot more accurate to stand any chance of matching the trailblazing Samoan quarter-finalists of the 1990s with Scotland, Japan and Ireland to come, even after some impressively worked tries for Lee-Lo, Afaesetiti Amosa and two each for the wingers Alapati Leiua and Ed Fidow.\n\nAfter going at Japan hard in the tournament\u2019s opening game and giving the hosts a scare in the process, Russia set out with the same gameplan and again found themselves in the lead early on in front of a crowd packed with enthusiastic local fans.\n\nThe noticeably fresher Samoans struck first though after a fine skip pass from Clermont Auvergne\u2019s Tim Nanai-Williams found Leiua and the Bristol man, who shifted to the wing in a late injury-enforced change, jinked his way over in the corner.\n\nBut the Russian set piece and kicking game that concerned the Samoa coach, Steve Jackson, before kick-off tested his side\u2019s discipline and as the penalty count ticked up, the Russia fly-half Yury Kushnarev knocked two over for a 6-5 lead.\n\nWith World Rugby publicly criticising the officiating over the first weekend of the World Cup shortly before kick-off, Romain Poite had a decision to make on 28 minutes when the centre Lee-Lo went in high on the Russia captain, Vasily Artemyev. Poite and his television match official deemed that Artemyev had dipped slightly into the tackle and made the same call two minutes later when a near identical tackle sent hooker Matu\u2019u to the bin.\n\nTheir opponents were unable to make anything from the two-man advantage, something Artemyev rued after the game as the punishing four-day turnaround from the Japan defeat began to show among their unchanged side in the second half.\n\nAmosa put the Samoans back in front with a try just after the break and Gotvotsev\u2019s yellow card for catching him high just as he was about to score ended Amosa\u2019s night too after his knee buckled in the collision.\n\nMatu\u2019u also failed a head injury assessment and could miss their Sept. 30 clash with Scotland in Kobe.\n\nSamoa showed how to use the 10-minute advantage and put the game out of sight by the time Gotvotsev returned, first with the kind of flair Vui promised before the game as replacement hooker Ray Niuia\u2019s delicious no-look reverse pass put Fidow through.\n\nThe winger got his second minutes later before Lee-Lo and Leiua rounded the score off against the Russians, who now have nine days off until they meet Ireland in Kobe.", "description": "Samoa survived two first-half yellow cards to beat Russia 34-9 in their opening game of the tournament", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82b62ff56b7d1f1275bbc47597320e4cb31bbb2/16_0_3468_2082/master/3468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86ceaf9c93c4f5adebd084d87d95d947", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
