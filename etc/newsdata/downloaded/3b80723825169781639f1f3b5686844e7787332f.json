Jack Reed, D-R.I. \u201cToday, he made it clear he is willing to take funds from our troops and disaster victims and divert them to try to protect his political right flank. And ultimately, that could put Americans at risk.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Trump administration has been touting progress made on the border.\n\n\u201cConstruction continues on the border wall in Yuma, AZ,\u201d Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tweeted over the weekend. \u201cThe process includes panel fabrication and delivery, demolition, soil conditioning and digging, trench digging, panel hoisting and installation.\u201d\n\nUse of the money had been frozen by lower courts while a lawsuit proceeded. Last month, however, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the use of about $2.5 billion.\n\nA border wall was a keystone of the president's 2016 election campaign, but Congress has resisted funding all of it. This year it allocated $1.4 billion, but the president wanted much more.\n\nThe administration has awarded $2.8 billion in contracts for barriers covering 247 miles, with all but 17 miles of that to replace existing barriers instead of expanding coverage.\n\nVarious forms of barriers already have existed along 654 miles \u2014 about a third \u2014 of the border.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe construction plan came as immigrant apprehensions have fallen sharply over the past two months due to the summer heat and a clampdown in Mexico.\n\nTens of thousands of people have come to the U.S. over the past year. Most have been Central American families with children, turning themselves in to agents instead of trying to dodge them.\n\nFox News\u2019 Mike Emanuel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper has signed off on spending $3.6 billion in Defense Department construction funds for 175 miles of wall on the southern border with Mexico, Pentagon officials told Fox News on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Lucas Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/27/694940094001_6077821688001_6077808486001-vs.jpg"}
