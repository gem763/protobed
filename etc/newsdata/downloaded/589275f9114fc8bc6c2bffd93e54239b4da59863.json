Once complete, its 28 wind turbines are expected to provide approximately 475 GWh a year.\n\nA large Canadian corporate partner has signed a long-term power purchase agreement for the majority of the energy output, BHE Canada said in a statement.\n\nBHE Canada and RES have also permitted the Forty Mile Wind Farm in the County of 40 Mile in southeastern Alberta and are looking for partners in long-term power purchase agreements. This project will have a generation capacity of 398.5 MW, potentially making it the largest wind power project in Canada.", "description": "The $200 million Rattlesnake Ridge Wind project will be located southwest of Medicine Hat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/warren-buffett.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
