Some 60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, mostly after age 60. While there is no cure, exercises such as tai chi, boxing and dancing have been found to alleviate some symptoms and improve physical mobility, according to the American Parkinson Disease Association.\n\n\u201cThe results of the study suggest that karate may be an appropriate and effective strategy for improving functional mobility deficits,\u201d too, says Jori Fleisher, a neurologist at Rush and the primary investigator of the study, which she says is under review for publication. \u201cAll exercise is a plus, but with karate and especially kata\u2014the drill sequence that is done on both sides of the body\u2014we are seeing the possibility of new neural pathways that help with balance and gait.\u201d\n\nMs. Meyer (center) says karate has improved her balance and coordination.

The second phase of the trial is under way now, with 50 participants and a control group. Results are expected in early 2020.\n\nTerry Ellis, director of the Center for Neurorehabilitation at Boston University, says that despite the study\u2019s shortcomings, the level of engagement reported among participants was very encouraging. The attendance rate for the program was 87%, which is higher than that of most other exercise programs aimed at people with Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n\u201cMany people living with Parkinson's disease have difficulty exercising on their own because of depression and apathy,\u201d says Dr. Ellis, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cThe camaraderie is very motivating and helps people stick with it, which is half the battle.\u201d\n\nWhether exercise merely alleviates symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s or actually slows progression of the disease remains unclear. Data from studies in animals and humans suggest a potential slowing, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have a way to measure changes in disease progression in a sensitive fashion,\u201d Dr. Ellis says. \u201cWhat we do know is that\u2026those with [Parkinson\u2019s] who exercise have less disability and more function over the long term.\u201d\n\nThe karate program studied at Rush involved no physical contact, but did include the shouting and grunting vocalizations, called kiai, typically made when performing moves. Students say that helps with breathing and confidence\u2014and can relieve feelings of frustration over the betrayal of their bodies.\n\nAnother important part of their instruction: How to fall to prevent further injury. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how often that comes in handy,\u201d says Nola Gustafson, 78 years old, who was diagnosed in 2016.\n\nMs. Meyer, who has moved up from beginner to orange belt, says she likes the sense of achievement she gets from her karate sessions.

She also does cardio-spin and has hired a personal trainer. But karate gives her something she doesn\u2019t get from the other activities. \u201cI like the sense of achievement\u2026the competitiveness with yourself,\u201d she says, proudly pointing to her orange belt, the third ranking up from beginner status.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to keep at it, to not let your Parkinson\u2019s be an excuse\u2026and to keep on exercising because it is the only thing you can control.\u201d\n\nMs. Rubin is a writer in Chicago.
