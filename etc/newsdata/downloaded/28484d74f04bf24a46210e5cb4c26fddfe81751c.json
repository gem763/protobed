National Law Journal reporter Ryan Lovelace writes that she believes Ford was motivated to come forward and testify against Kavanaugh in part to help protect Roe v. Wade from being overturned.\n\nNew book claims Christine Blasey Ford's attorney admits accusations against Kavanaugh were based on Ford's agenda to protect Roe v. Wade.https://t.co/U3feAZdLmi \u2014 Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) September 3, 2019\n\nAsche Schow reports for The Daily Wire:\n\nPaul Bedard of the Washington Examiner was given a video clip by the author of Ford\u2019s attorney, Debra Katz, speaking at a legal conference where she made the acknowledgment. \u201cIn the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine\u2019s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,\u201d Katz told an audience at the University of Baltimore\u2019s 11th Feminist Legal Theory Conference. \u201cWe were going to have a conservative [justice] \u2026 elections have consequences, but he will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important; it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nNow that isn\u2019t exactly proof that Ford was lying, but was there ever any doubt that she (or Kavanaugh\u2019s other accusers) came forward to keep a conservative justice nominated by President Trump off the Supreme Court?\n\nI'm shocked! Shocked, I say! \u2014 Sharon Sparks (@Sparks1Sharon) September 3, 2019\n\nAnyone surprised? \u2014 John Ayres (@JohnAyr12294351) September 3, 2019\n\nWow, did anyone see that one coming ? How \u2018bout nearly everyone except Dem members of Senate Judiciary comm? The blatant disregard for due process & lack of honest pursuit of truth was brutally obvious from the likes of Blumenthal, Booker, Coons, Durbin, Feinstein, & Harris. \u2014 Charles T Mehlman (@t_mehlman) September 3, 2019\n\nBut it did give Booker and Harris a chance to grandstand in preparation for the presidential runs.\n\nNo surprise there. \u2014 Paul (@paulc130) September 3, 2019\n\nLike we didn't know that.. \u2014 Smoking Mans Ghost (@SmokingMan) September 3, 2019\n\nWonder if Alysa Milano will apologize is this turns out to be true. \u2014 Celia ORand (@celia_orand) September 3, 2019\n\nDoubt it. \u2014 Kate Schneider (@schneiderkate7) September 3, 2019\n\nI\u2019m shocked \u2013 NOT! \u2014 Alexis Lowe (@AlexisLowe) September 3, 2019\n\nThat's now indelible in my hippocampus \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Restovus \ud83d\udca7\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf28 (@RowdyTrader) September 3, 2019\n\nZing!\n\nSo when does CNN or MSNBC offer Christine Blasey Ford a gig? \u2014 JannyJ922 (@JannyJ922) September 3, 2019\n\nYou\u2019ve got to admit they did succeed, though, in keeping an asterisk next to Kavanaugh\u2019s name, at least to The Resistance who will never not believe he\u2019s a drunken frat-boy rapist who spiked drinks at parties and organized gang-rape rooms.\n\n\"When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important; it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d Debra Katz, lawyer for Christine Blasey Ford. \u2014 Daniel (@_Djadan) September 3, 2019\n\nSick, but we all knew it. \u2014 Fendar \ud83d\ude9c\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@fendar) September 3, 2019\n\nI thought it was very obvious at the hearing what her goal was. \u2014 Matthew Petryszak (@MATTP1949) September 3, 2019\n\nTestifying falsely against a Supreme Court nominee is a federal crime and should be prosecuted as such. \u2014 Phillip Ruland (@Rulo123) September 3, 2019\n\nWhy has she not been charged and prosecuted? @realDonaldTrump \u2014 Drew (@DrewN1977) September 3, 2019\n\nWho would prosecute it? More galling to me is the way @LindseyGrahamSC welched on a full investigation into the concealment and unlawful leaking of Ford's letter, which would've been fully investigated early in the confirmation process if Democrats had followed the rules. \u2014 (((L.N. Smithee))) (@LNSmithee) September 3, 2019\n\nSo, yet again, the whole purpose was to protect the leftist, progressive agenda. Unbelievable. I hope Kavanaugh pursues a case against her. This can't stand. This can't become an acceptable practice or some sort of new normal. \u2014 BJ Rechtel (@BjRechtel) September 3, 2019\n\nIt was political?!?\ud83d\ude31 \u2014 foreverlost45 (@matchbox982) September 3, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Is the author suggesting women would make up false accusations to protect Roe v.
