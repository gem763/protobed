Fed Repo Operations as Quarter-End Nears", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Primary dealers piled into the Federal Reserve\u2019s repo operations Tuesday, signaling demand for cash heading into the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe New York Fed held a 14-day term repurchase-agreement operation followed by an overnight action, with both coming in oversubscribed. The measures are part of a plan the central bank announced last week after a tumultuous few days in which a liquidity crunch caused funding costs to spike to record levels.\n\nWhile the term repo operation was oversubscribed, the rates at which bids were submitted and accepted suggested to some observers that the need for funding isn\u2019t necessarily acute. Despite elevated demand, there was \u201cno sign of a scramble\u201d on Tuesday, Brean Capital\u2019s Russ Certo said.\n\n\u201cBasically, those dealers were saying that if the Fed really wants to give them bargain funding, they\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Wrightson ICAP\u2019s Lou Crandall. \u201cBut they don\u2019t absolutely need it.\u201d\n\nIn the first of this week\u2019s three 14-day term repurchase-agreement operations by the New York Fed, dealers submitted $62 billion of securities, more than the $30 billion offered by the central bank.\n\nIn a second action, the N.Y. Fed took $75 billion of securities in an overnight repo operation -- the maximum amount -- with dealers submitting about $80 billion of assets.\n\nThe bank\u2019s measures came as overnight general collateral repo rates climbed anew Tuesday after trading back within the Fed\u2019s target range late last week. The rate traded as high as 2.07% before falling to around 2%. It had traded under that level the past few business days, according to ICAP data.\n\nFurther term repo actions are planned for Thursday and Friday, while overnight operations are set to take place every day through Oct. 10.\n\nThe market turns its focus next to this afternoon\u2019s $40 billion auction of two-year Treasury notes for a gauge of dealer confidence in funding markets. A slate of more than $90 billion of notes and bills will follow this week.\n\nAmid volatility in the repo market last week, Thursday\u2019s bill auctions met a poor reception, suggesting skepticism that the Fed\u2019s actions to that point were sufficient to quell the funding crunch.\n\nGoing into this afternoon\u2019s offering, analysts appear to be less concerned. For one thing, the backdrop for buying debt is supportive, amid uncertainty surrounding U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit, and some worrisome German economic data.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence of appetite for Tuesday\u2019s maturity.\n\nInvestment funds\u2019 take-down of 56.6% at the two-year sale in August was the highest on record and indicated \u201cstill-strong demand\u201d from that segment, suggesting dealers won\u2019t need to absorb much of this one, BMO Capital Markets strategist Ben Jeffery wrote in a note to clients.\n\n(Adds comment about Treasury auction.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.net;Emily Barrett in New York at ebarrett25@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Mark Tannenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Primary dealers piled into the Federal Reserve\u2019s repo operations Tuesday, signaling demand for cash heading into the end of the third quarter.The New York Fed held a 14-day term repurchase-agreement operation followed by an overnight action, with both coming in oversubscribed.
