Under the section 14 notices, which were handed out to tents at around 7.30am, the activists will be allowed to demonstrate in a specified location \u2013 Trafalgar Square.\n\n\n\nThose who do not comply with the order and move their belongings will be arrested, though many camping on the corner of Horseferry Road and Marsham Street, near to the Home Office, still intend to stay.\n\nMany activists had no plans to move their tents to Trafalgar Square. One activist in his 20s said: \u201cThey came round and told us that we should be moving on. I don\u2019t think we are going to move on. It\u2019s not a risk if you know you\u2019re going to be arrested. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll do if I need to.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got extremely good legal support and it\u2019s a very well set-up organisation so I feel like I\u2019ll be supported all through the way. An arrest doesn\u2019t mean a conviction.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother young activist added that there was no pressure from the movement to protest in a particular way.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re being arrested doesn\u2019t mean you do or don\u2019t support Extinction Rebellion any more than the next person,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are people within this group that support this group very much and they won\u2019t be getting arrested, but they support everybody.\u201d\n\nThe group had glued themselves to the Department for Transport with other plans for activity at other government departments planned for throughout the day.\n\nThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, attacked the Extinction Rebellion activists, dismissing them as \u201cuncooperative crusties\u201d who should stop blocking the streets of the capital with their \u201cheaving hemp-smelling bivouacs\u201d.\n\nJohnson made the remarks at the launch of the final volume of a biography of Margaret Thatcher written by his former boss at the Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore.", "description": "Latest action comes as protesters camping in central London are issued with warnings by police", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh", "Lisa Nandy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f704c4b9d487c3c5443fb5ba17f07c1bb1458d/0_227_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3ce214dc4e40b9b5a014c09975ee125", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
