It was Vidal\u2019s first start and he scored \u2013 doing exactly that: arriving in the box \u2013 to score the second goal in the 4-0 win.\n\nWhen he was taken off in the second period he received an ovation that never would have happened a year earlier. His road to acceptance at Barcelona has been a long one.\n\nArturo Vidal is enjoying a renaissance at Barcelona in the early stages of the 2019-20 season\n\nVidal produced a starring display as Barcelona defeated Sevilla 4-0 on Sunday in La Liga\n\nA year ago, Vidal looked like he was cast out on the fringes of the squad by Barcelona\n\nARTURO VIDAL STATS THIS SEASON Appearances: 6 Goals: 2 Assists: 1\n\nIn October last year he was left on the bench for the game against Tottenham in the Champions League. He didn\u2019t like being dropped and he didn\u2019t like being brought on for just four minutes at the end of the game either. After the match he took to Instagram to show his displeasure with an angry-face Emoji.\n\nThat sort of flippancy doesn\u2019t usually end well at Barcelona, or at Real Madrid \u2013 memories come to mind of Kaka\u2019s wife tweeting on his behalf to complain that he was not being picked.\n\nVidal already had it tough because he had been pigeon-holed as the bruising midfield enforcer that the team might need from time to time when plan A \u2013 playing the Barca way \u2013 was not working.\n\nThe Robert Di Niro Taxi Driver appearance and those stories from the past had already made him out to be someone who might not fit in the long term at the Camp Nou.\n\nIn 2015 he crashed his Ferrari on his way to a casino. According to local media he was over the alcohol limit and all while on Copa America duty for Chile. It had not been the first time he had not been the model pro off the pitch so how would he fit in at Barcelona?\n\nVidal shared a picture of an angry emoji when benched in the Champions League last year\n\nBut now, in an ever-changing Barcelona midfield, Vidal appears to be making a big difference\n\nAt the Nou Camp, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic have been two-thirds of a Barcelona midfield that since 2015 has won a treble and three leagues. But Rakitic is a player they are desperate to sell because he still commands a good price.\n\nAnd the plan is to protect Busquets from the sort of burnout that has often taken something away from the last month of his season. Vidal didn\u2019t just score at the weekend he also turned around Barcelona's Champions League meeting with Inter a few days before.\n\nAt half-time Barca were losing 1-0 and playing badly. Coach Valverde flipped his midfield triangle taking off Busquets and, with Frenkie de Jong and Arthur Melo now at the base he put Vidal at the apex.\n\nSuddenly Inter Milan\u2019s three centre-backs, having completely bossed Luis Suarez in the first half, had something a little more taxing to think of. With Vidal and Suarez troubling them there was less manpower to deal with Lionel Messi\u2019s wanderings.\n\nVidal helped Barcelona come from behind to defeat Inter Milan in the Champions League\n\nVidal has scored two goals in six games so far, including one strike against Real Betis\n\nVidal now has the foundations in place to kick on and play a key role for Barcelona this season\n\nHe sauntered through the Inter back line and set-up Suarez for what was the winning goal. For once, Valverde had changed a game with his substitutions and Vidal was the player he had used to do it.\n\nThat applause as he went off on Sunday after another important contribution seemed to signal a sea-change in opinion. Barcelona supporters have remembered that Vidal\u2019s eight league titles have been as much about his intelligence as a player, as about his physical attributes.\n\nBarcelona have overbooking in midfield this season but far from pushing Vidal out of the door it seems to have made him more important in Valverde\u2019s ever-changing midfield.", "description": "PETE JENSON IN SPAIN: The sacred cows of Barcelona's midfield are no longer untouchable and it seems Arturo Vidal stands to gain most from the change.", "authors": ["Pete Jenson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19435104-0-image-a-17_1570526340865.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
