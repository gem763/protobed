The central bank\u2019s status as an independent agency derives from an act of Congress in 1913, and is reinforced by oft-invoked references to its statutory \u201cdual mandate\u201d: to achieve stable prices and full employment.\n\nBut the Fed\u2019s job description is more complicated than people usually think. Its purposes have evolved through various legislative changes over the decades, the most notable of which was imposed by Congress in 1977. The Federal Reserve Reform Act, which gave the central bank its current, explicit mandate, named three goals rather than two.\n\nThe legislation as amended states: \u201cThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy\u2019s long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\u201d\n\nWhile policy makers frequently expound on the Fed\u2019s mandate to promote full employment and stable prices, its duty to promote moderate long-term interest rates is seldom mentioned. Yet the third goal is vital, and it goes to the heart of the problem of today\u2019s inverted yield curve. Short-term interest rates should be lower than long-term interest rates; it\u2019s a basic premise of sound finance and rational investment conditions. Why does the Fed treat the first two objectives with such reverence but disregard the third pillar as an equal imperative?\n\nThe Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, also known as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, is the other major law that has shaped the Federal Reserve\u2019s role. It imposed on the Fed an obligation to pursue specific economic goals in the best interests of the nation. But contrary to the notion that the Fed should stand aloof as an independent agency, the intention of the 1978 law was to harness monetary policy to achieve the enumerated goals through \u201cbetter integration\u201d of economic policy-making within the federal government:\n\n\u201cAttainment of these objectives should be facilitated by setting explicit short-term and medium-term economic goals, and by improved coordination among the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\u201d\n\nDeclaring that \u201ctrade deficits are a major national problem,\u201d the Humphrey-Hawkins Act explicitly states\u2014six times\u2014that \u201cachievement of an improved trade balance\u201d should be a primary objective of coordinated economic policy-making within the federal government. The law elaborates on the need to \u201cgive proper attention to the role of increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry in providing productive employment opportunities and achieving an improved trade balance.\u201d It states that fulfilling such objectives \u201cwill promote the economic security and well-being of all citizens of the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe Humphrey-Hawkins Act quietly expired in 2000, but its legacy for ensuring the central bank\u2019s accountability continues through the biannual testimony given to Congress by the Fed chairman. If the Fed were to evaluate its own performance in adhering to the full slate of directives received from Congress, how would it score?\n\nCurrent employment levels and participation rates are impressively high. But the Fed deserves little credit for this, as it acknowledges in the FAQs on its own website: \u201cThe maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the job market.\u201d\n\nAs for stable prices, the Fed should necessarily rate its performance as unsatisfactory given its difficulties in reaching its own 2% inflation goal. The Fed has also failed to meet the standard set by Humphrey-Hawkins, which gave a goal of zero inflation by 1988. Finally, with pension funds struggling for adequate yields to cover their liabilities, the Fed can hardly claim to have delivered moderate long-term interest rates.\n\nThe point of taking a closer look at these two laws is to recognize that Congress historically hasn\u2019t sought to treat the Federal Reserve as a detached lever of economic power. Rather, lawmakers intended to incorporate monetary policy into an overarching effort to achieve \u201cimportant national requirements\u201d that improve U.S. economic prospects.\n\nHumphrey-Hawkins was particularly insightful\u2014even prescient\u2014in calling for improved coordination of U.S. economic policy to address \u201cforeign competition in the United States and abroad\u201d and to ensure \u201cthe ability of our economy to compete successfully in international markets.\u201d In language that resonates today on the need to confront unfair trade tactics and currency maneuvering by U.S. trading partners, the law notes that attainment of the requirements depends on policies that promote \u201ca free and fair international trading system and a sound and stable international monetary order.\u201d\n\nIt would be appropriate and constructive for the Fed to consider international monetary stability in its interest-rate decisions. In an era of world-wide currency exchange, America\u2019s central bank should not ignore the effects of movements spurred by other major central banks. With no consistent free-trade principles governing global monetary policy, the Fed must take proactive steps to ensure that the U.S. can compete successfully.\n\nIt would be in keeping with its historical mandate if the Fed were to pursue a more coordinated relationship with both Congress and the president. When it comes to fulfilling the economic goals authorized by legislative decree, it isn\u2019t seemly for a government agency to be selective.\n\nMs. Shelton, an economist, is author of \u201cMoney Meltdown: Restoring Order to the Global Currency System.\u201d President Trump has announced his intention to nominate her to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.", "description": "Lawmakers in the past have broadened the central bank\u2019s goals, directing it to boost U.S. competitiveness.", "authors": ["Judy Shelton"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107402/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
