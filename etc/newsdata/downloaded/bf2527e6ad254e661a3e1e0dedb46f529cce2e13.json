Instead, he devoted his summer to work on a political campaign.\n\nBetween June and August, Nicholas, along with 75 other student interns (ages 12 to 22), researched policy positions, stuffed envelopes and distributed campaign literature on behalf of Legislator Josh Lafazan of Nassau County. They also knocked on 25,000 doors in Long Island towns like Bayville, Syosset and Locust Valley.\n\n\u201cI was nervous before I knocked on the first door,\u201d said Nicholas, who added that homeowners were often confused to be greeted by children who wanted nothing more than to talk politics. But Nicholas and his brother, Neil, 14, another intern, found that it usually worked to their advantage.\n\n\u201cWhen we actually started talking about Josh\u2019s policies, people were surprised and happy that we could talk to them at such a young age and that we were doing this for our community,\u201d Neil said. \u201cIt was good to get to know people from different backgrounds so we can understand their different positions on things.\u201d", "description": "Josh Lafazan is one of the youngest legislators in New York.
