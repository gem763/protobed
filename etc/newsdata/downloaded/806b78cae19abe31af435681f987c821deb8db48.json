After Sunday night\u2019s 7-1 loss to the Houston Astros in the fifth game of the World Series \u2014 the Nationals\u2019 third loss in three games here \u2014 it would end with a loss Tuesday night in Houston.\n\nYet these are the 2019 Nats, and they look at external expectations \u2014 and, well, expectorate on them. Given that, why not force a Game 7?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe arc of this Nationals season will always be about 19-31 before Memorial Day and a 100-plus-game sprint to the franchise\u2019s first pennant. Whatever happens against the Astros \u2014 the absolutely loaded Astros \u2014 that won\u2019t change.\n\nBut the emotions Sunday night seemed filled with what carried the team, and the fans behind them, through this entire season. Fire the manager? Well, look how he held things together. Trail the New York Mets by six runs in the ninth? Score seven to win. Down to your last six outs in the wild-card game? Plate three runs in the eighth to win. Get pushed to a game from elimination against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the division series? Overcome that deficit \u2014 including trailing 3-1 in the eighth inning of Game 5 \u2014 to advance in October for the first time.\n\nSo when Scherzer woke up with a knot in his neck that made it, he said, \u201cimpossible just to do any menial task whatsoever today,\u201d it fit the entirety of 2019. Last home game, and a guy who was banished to the Pacific Coast League has to start it on short notice?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJust another chapter,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said.\n\nNow, either the story peters out \u2014 or Stephen Strasburg pushes it forward Tuesday night in Game 6. The $175 million right-hander may or may not be making his last appearance for the Nats; he can opt out of his contract within 72 hours of the season\u2019s last out. Either way, he\u2019ll need help to extend the season.\n\nIn taking the first two games of the World Series last week in Houston, the Nats scored 17 runs. They loaded the plane, but they left their offense in Texas. The 1933 Washington Senators scored seven runs in their four losses to the New York Giants in the most recent World Series to have games staged here. These Nats scored three over the weekend on South Capitol Street. Fail to change that, and there not only won\u2019t be a title, but there won\u2019t be a Game 7 \u2014 regardless of how well Strasburg pitches.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNationally, Game 5 will be framed as the bounce-back of Gerrit Cole, Houston\u2019s ace who was shelled for five runs by the Nats in a stunning series opener. There will be a lot of truth to that, because Cole barely allowed Washington to sniff a rally. Only once \u2014 in the second \u2014 did the Nats have two runners on base at the same time. Cole\u2019s response: A strikeout of Ryan Zimmerman and a double-play grounder from fleet Victor Robles.\n\nBut if you were among the faithful here \u2014 those who stood for Ross, those who hoped for a languishing offense to break out, those who wanted to apply the narrative of the season to the final game at this yard \u2014 you walked out muttering to yourself about the umpiring. Yourself? Heck, anyone who would listen. You remember Ross\u2019s 0-2 pitch to Houston\u2019s Carlos Correa in the fourth. And you remember Cole\u2019s 3-2 pitch to Robles in the seventh.\n\nCorrea first: The Astros had a 2-0 lead on the strength of Yordan Alvarez\u2019s two-run homer in the second, Ross\u2019s only mistake \u2014 and one Scherzer could have easily made himself. With two outs and Alvarez on first, Ross was a strike away from extracting himself from the fourth admirably. Given that eight of his starts this year were made for the Class AAA Fresno Grizzlies, one more strike would have meant you could have asked no more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRoss\u2019s 0-2 pitch was a slider over the outside part of the plate. Look at whatever presentation you want \u2014 Fox\u2019s broadcast or MLB.com\u2019s Gamecast or your naked eye. It appears the pitch caught the corner. \u201cI thought it was a strike,\u201d Ross said. Home plate umpire Lance Barksdale called it a ball.\n\nFour pitches later, Correa hit the two-run homer that made it 4-0.\n\n\u201cAs far as baseball goes, something small happens, it seems like later that at-bat, always something big follows up,\u201d Ross said. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s how it went.\u201d\n\nYet here came the crowd, carrying faint hope into the bottom of the seventh. Juan Soto\u2019s solo homer \u2014 his second off Cole this series \u2014 kept the place lively and loud. When Ryan Zimmerman drew a walk on Cole\u2019s 104th pitch \u2014 which Cole will believe was a strike till his dying days \u2014 there was still hope. Another base runner, and \u2014 whatever the struggles of the weekend \u2014 the tying run would get to the plate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRobles, who walked only 35 times in 617 plate appearances this season, nonetheless worked the count full against a tiring Cole. And here came the pitch an entire fan base could get behind. Scherzer hadn\u2019t pitched at all. The offense hadn\u2019t provided a reason to cheer. Wouldn\u2019t it be so 2019 Nats to rally against the otherworldly Cole?\n\nCole went up and outside with a fastball. Robles took it \u2014 and started to first. Barksdale rang him up. Cole pumped his fist. The crowd lost it.\n\n\u201cI thought it could have been a little bit up and out,\u201d Martinez said, a watered-down version of what he and his coaches said from the dugout.\n\nMartinez, though, would not disparage Barksdale afterward. Leave that to his fans. Whatever the World Series became here over the weekend \u2014 three anticipated games, three home losses, the series slipping away \u2014 it says here the crowds were spectacular. The boos for Barksdale\u2019s call, well, they outdid the full-throated boos of President Trump four innings earlier, which is saying something.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot that it matters much. Correa hit his homer. Robles was out on strikes. The umps didn\u2019t lose the game.\n\nThe Astros fly to Houston with a 3-2 lead in the series, one win from a second championship in three seasons. No World Series has ever ended with the road team winning all seven games, and that\u2019s exactly what would have to happen for the Nationals to claim the crown. Unlikely, for sure. Impossible? We\u2019re done telling the 2019 Nationals what can and cannot happen. Come back Tuesday for one more game \u2014 at least.\n\nRead more on the World Series:\n\nAD", "description": "Failing to win in Washington puts the Nationals in a must-win situation with the World Series shifting back to Houston.
