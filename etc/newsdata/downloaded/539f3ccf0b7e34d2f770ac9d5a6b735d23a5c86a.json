So thank you for letting him crash the party.\u2019\n\nThe participants \u2013 from countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Iraq, Malawi and Bangladesh \u2013 shared their personal achievements and the best practices that had helped them overcome significant obstacles.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBefore the discussion, Mehgan and Harry were filmed arriving in a grey electric Audi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir use of the electric vehicle comes after the couple have been accused of hypocrisy for using private jets while supporting environmental campaigns.\n\nIt was their first public appearance since a revealing documentary where they discussed the impact of intense media scrutiny.\n\nMeghan, seated next to her husband, told the group: \u2018I think we\u2019re all aware that One Young World has been very important to me for several years and now being vice president of QCT (Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust), it just felt like the perfect medley.\n\nThey arrived in a grey electric Audi (Picture: AP))\n\nThey sat side by side at the round table discussion (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018What you\u2019re all capable of doing independently is incredible but then when you work collectively, our intention today is to try to create somewhat of a task force to see what we can do within our communities and then use that knowledge to apply it to whatever is happening in all these other communities.\u2019\n\nHarry and Meghan heard from the founder of the south African organisation Motholung Network Against Women and Child Abuse, Lebogang Bogopane, about her personal experiences of familial domestic violence.\n\nMs Bogopane said: \u2018I got married very young and experienced domestic violence. My mother is a survivor and I\u2019m also a survivor.
