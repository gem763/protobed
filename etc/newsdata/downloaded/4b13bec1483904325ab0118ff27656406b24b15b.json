When you see it on the other side you\u2019re envious of it.\u201d\n\nSlumping rookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez and Carlos Correa each hit an early two-run homer off emergency starter Joe Ross. George Springer added another postseason drive, and Houston won its third straight at Nationals Park.\n\nWhat a turnaround, too - outscored 17-7 overall at Minute Maid Park, 107-win Houston hammered wild-card Washington 19-3 at Nationals Park.\n\n\u201cWe actually hit some balls hard. We really did,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t get nothing going these last three days.\u201d\n\nScherzer beat Cole in the opener, and was the Nats\u2019 best hope to slow Houston. But he was scratched just 3 1/2 hours before game time because of an irritated nerve near his neck, an injury that could finish him for the Series.\n\nWith the road team winning every time so far, Houston heads home with two chances to claim its second title in three years. Justin Verlander gets the first try when he starts against Stephen Strasburg in Game 6 on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cHigh level of confidence,\u201d Cole said.\n\nCole threw three-hit ball for seven innings, nicked only by Juan Soto\u2019s home run in the seventh, and struck out nine - eight on breaking balls.\n\n\u201cI just thought that we needed to execute better pitches this time out, and I didn\u2019t realize that that was how we got that many strikeouts,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI guess the situation just called for breaking balls in that spot. That\u2019s what we were feeling.\u201d\n\nCole\u2019s mix of 99 mph heat and sharp secondary pitches induced a bevy of bad swings from the Nats as he improved to 4-1 with a 1.72 ERA this postseason. It might\u2019ve been his final start for Houston - he\u2019s eligible for free agency and figures to command a steep price.\n\nStanding tall on the mound, Cole was unflappable in the face of 43,910 fans who went from fired up to furious to flat-out frustrated.\n\nThe crowd gave Ross a huge ovation when he walked onto the field for warmups, sympathetic to his situation - he had pitched a total of two innings in almost a month.\n\nBut when President Donald Trump was shown on the videoboard for about 10 seconds before the fourth inning, watching from a lower-level suite, the fans let loose with loud boos and broke into a brief but very audible chant of \u201cLock him up!\u201d\n\nThe fans weren\u2019t finished, either.\n\nCole ended his outing by getting Victor Robles on a called third strike, a pitch the TV zone showed to be off the plate. Robles chucked his bat, helmet and gloves, and the crowd soon began a derisive chant at umpire Lance Barksdale.\n\n\u201cI know there were some choice words but that\u2019s just in the heat of the moment,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nCole acknowledged he finished his outing \u201cwith a break.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I think ultimately some of those pitches were off the plate,\u201d he said.\n\nMost fans, meanwhile, stayed to the very end.\n\n\u201cThey came to support us and really gave us everything they had all the way to the end, all 27 innings. Hats off to them. We apologize that we didn\u2019t give them more to celebrate,\u201d outfielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we didn\u2019t try.\u201d\n\nCole led the majors in strikeouts this year, was second to Verlander in wins and topped the AL in ERA. He took a 19-game winning streak into the opener but hardly looked like an October star, giving up five runs over seven uneven innings.\n\nIn his second shot against the Nationals, he aced the test. His lone early wobble came when he dropped a return toss from catcher Martin Maldonado after a foul ball.\n\nCole escaped a first-and-third, no-out jam in the second, then breezed into the seventh.\n\nAlvarez, normally Houston\u2019s designated hitter, quickly justified his spot in left field. He launched a drive to left-center in the second.\n\nAlvarez hit 27 home runs in 87 games this season, but hadn\u2019t connected in 71 at-bats since Sept. 21.\n\nCorrea made it 4-0 with his homer in the fourth and Yuli Gurriel added a two-out RBI single in the eighth.\n\nSpringer\u2019s 15th career postseason home run - seven in the World Series for the 2017 Series MVP - finished off the rout.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: Strasburg is 4-0 with a 1.93 ERA this postseason. He won the wild-card game in relief, then won starts against the Dodgers, Cardinals and Astros. He outpitched Verlander in Game 2, giving up two runs in six innings. Strasburg led the NL with 18 victories this season.\n\nAstros: Verlander is the only pitcher to start out 0-5 in the World Series after losing Game 2. He\u2019s made six starts overall in the Fall Classic with a 5.73 ERA. Verlander went 21-6 this year and led the majors in wins, but is 1-3 with a 4.15 ERA in five postseason starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Houston Astros handed the ball to Gerrit Cole, and he gave them a firm grip on the World Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ben Walker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/world_series_astros_nationals_baseball_88645_c0-148-3566-2228_s1200x700.jpg?ab05fd965c388e6a69b0ac49ed8cfa5f6f751c35", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
