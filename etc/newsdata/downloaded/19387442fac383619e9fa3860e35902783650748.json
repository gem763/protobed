(Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)\n\nNovak Djokovic\u2019s US Open run came to a surprising end on Sunday night.\n\nDjokovic \u2014 the No. 1 player in the world and the tournament\u2019s defending champion \u2014 suddenly retired during the third set of his fourth-round match against Switzerland\u2019s Stan Wawrinka at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York due to a left shoulder injury.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWawrinka, the No. 23 seed, had grabbed an early lead when Djokovic called the match. Wawrinka had won the first two sets 6-4 and 7-5, respectively, and was up 2-1 early in the third set when Djokovic approached the net, clearly ready to be done.\n\n\u201cVery frustrating,\u201d Djokovic said,via the New York Times. \u201cObviously not the first, not the last player to get injured and to withdraw from one of the biggest events in sport. But obviously, I just came off the court, so of course it hurts.\u201d\n\nDefending US Open champion Novak Djokovic, who was battling a left shoulder injury, retires in the third set of his match with Stan Wawrinka.\n\n\n\nWawrinka advances to the quarterfinals. #USOpen pic.twitter.com/WXbhxo712E \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 2, 2019\n\nDjokovic was met with a mix of applause and boos as he walked off the court too, and gave a thumbs up to the crowd before entering the tunnel.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not being offended by, you know, mistreated by anybody,\u201d Djokovic said when asked about the crowd reaction, via the New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t really pay too much attention on that. You know, I like to respect others. I hope that others can respect me and my decision.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the crowd. Obviously they came to see a full match, and just wasn\u2019t to be. That\u2019s all it is. I mean, a lot of people didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, so you cannot blame them.\u201d\n\nDjokovic had battled through pain in his left shoulder during his first three rounds at the US Open, too, especially in his second-round match with Juan Ignacio Londero.\n\nThe 16-time Grand Slam winner was clearly in pain throughout the match on Sunday night, too, and had 35 unforced errors before he opted not to continue. Wawrinka won 84 percent of his points on the first serve and broke Djokovic\u2019s serve four times in the win, too.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s loss marked the first time he had been eliminated before the semifinal round of the US Open since 2006 \u2014 when he was just 19. He had won 36 of his past 37 Grand Slam matches and four of the last five major titles, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never the way you want to finish a match,\u201d Wawrinka said on the court after the win. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for Novak. He\u2019s a good friend, an amazing champion.\u201d\n\nWawrinka will now take on Russia\u2019s Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals. The three-time Grand Slam winner has rallied back this season after plummeting to No. 263 in the world in 2018. He entered the year back up at No. 66 in the rankings, and reached the quarterfinals of the French Open earlier this year.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Novak Djokovic fell to Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka on Sunday night, retiring early due to a left shoulder injury in the third set of their fourth round match at the US Open.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/18ZUckdNCASux3bNphfRJg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VNGavL0EuEo.6t53L3eGzw--~B/aD0xODk4O3c9Mjg0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4fef5500-cd30-11e9-8f93-12703a8b71ff"}
