In a press release published last month, Volusion claimed it had more than 20,000 customers.\n\nThe most notable compromise is the Sesame Street Live online store, which has been taken down earlier today after another journalist reached out.\n\nAt the time of writing, the malicious code is still on Volusion's servers and is still being delivered to all of the company's client stores.\n\nVolusion has not returned emails or phone calls from this reporter, nor from security researchers from Check Point and Trend Micro. Cyber-security firm RiskIQ is also tracking the incident and confirmed the hack to ZDNet.\n\n@Volusion Hi! We sent you a Direct Message. Looking forward to your reply. \u2014 Trend Micro Research (@TrendMicroRSRCH) October 7, 2019\n\nCompromised Google Cloud infrastructure\n\nThe incident took place this week after hackers gained access to Volusion's Google Cloud infrastructure, where they modified a JavaScript file and included malicious code that logs card details entered in online forms. Volusion is a known Google Cloud Platform customers.\n\nThe compromised file is hosted at https://storage.googleapis.com/volusionapi/resources.js [copy], and is loaded on Volusion-based online stores via the /a/j/vnav.js file.\n\nFor users interested in the inner workings of this code, Check Point security researcher Marcel Afrahim published an analysis on Medium earlier today.\n\nClassic Magecart supply-chain attack\n\nThe incident is what cyber-security experts call a Magecart attack or web card skimming, where crooks steal payment card details from online shops, rather than ATMs. These types of hacks have been happening for years, but they've intensified over the past two.\n\nIn a report published last week, RiskIQ said Magecart attacks have reached a peak, with card-stealing scripts (called skimmers) being spotted on more than 18,000 websites over the past few months.\n\nMost Magecart attacks take place when hackers use vulnerabilities in self-hosted stores to plant skimmer code on outdated online shops.\n\nBut, sometimes, hackers also manage to breach cloud-based platforms -- like Volusion -- or companies that provide widgets, analytics, ads, or other secondary services to online stores.\n\nSomething like the latter case happened in May when hackers breached the cloud infrastructure for seven companies that provided services to online stores -- namely Alpaca Forms, Picreel, AppLixir, RYVIU, OmniKick, eGain, and AdMaxim.\n\nThe May incidents were traced to those companies' misconfigured cloud-hosting accounts, which allowed hackers to modify existing files without permission.\n\nSimilar attacks followed over the summer, and in most, hackers targeted misconfigured Amazon Web Services accounts. The Volusion incident that's currently underway is the first one traced back to Google Cloud.", "description": "More than 6,500 stores have been compromised, but the number could be around 20,000.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/12/f2aa7bd8-6516-4577-bb82-7b760edbc443/thumbnail/770x578/435465791f5185987b6f3bc78e5ecaa4/shopping-cart-card-magecart-store.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
