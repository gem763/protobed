It\u2019s got the whole of India \u2013 all the political parties, all the people, everyone \u2013 up in arms against us.\n\n1st terrorist: Do you think they\u2019ll launch another surgical strike against us, like they did the last time, after the Uri attack?\n\n2nd terrorist: I think this time we\u2019ve got them so angry with us that I\u2019m afraid they might do something worse than just a surgical strike. In fact, they already have.\n\n1st terrorist: Something worse than a surgical strike? What\u2019s that?\n\n2nd terrorist: Something that could well end up putting us out of business permanently. And they\u2019ve already put their plan into action \u2013 they\u2019ve announced a 200% duty on Pakistani exports, which could be the first step to a total ban.\n\n1st terrorist: So? How does that affect us terrorists?\n\n2nd terrorist: Don\u2019t be such a gadha. What\u2019s Pakistan\u2019s biggest export, indeed it\u2019s only export? It\u2019s terror. In fact it\u2019s Pakistan\u2019s only industry, the manufacturing of terrorists like us. And if India, followed by all other countries, puts a total ban on the export of terror, Pakistan will go out of business, along with us.\n\n1st terrorist: Golly. What\u2019ll we do then? Maybe we could go in for some vocational training to help us find another profession. Perhaps we could enrol in an IIT, like India\u2019s IITs, which turn out engineers, and scientists, and suchlike.\n\n2nd terrorist: Forget it, chum. In India IIT stand for Indian Institute of Technology. Here, IIT stands for Internal Institute of Terrorism, which turns out only guys like us. And we\u2019ll soon be out of jobs.\n\n1st terrorist: But what\u2019ll we do then? It\u2019s not as though there\u2019s a pension plan for ex-terrorists.\n\n2nd terrorist: We\u2019ll do the only thing we can do: we\u2019ll blow each other up. And it\u2019ll all be the fault of Pakistan\u2019s ISI.\n\n1st terrorist: Inter-Services Intelligence?\n\n2nd terrorist: No \u2013 Islamabad\u2019s Senseless Idiocy \u2026", "description": "Two terrorists in a training camp in Pakistan anxiously discussing India\u2019s response to the Pulwama attack. 1st terrorist: Pulwama was a bad move on our part. 2nd terrorist: A very bad move.
