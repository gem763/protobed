That is clear in his own Twitter feed. After attacking Fox for giving Mr. Napolitano a megaphone \u2014 \u201che\u2019s been terrible\u201d \u2014 employing anchor Shep Smith \u2014 \u201cwho gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN\u201d \u2014 and generally venting his displeasure, he then retweeted Maria Bartiromo, a Fox Business anchor who has been broadcasting supportive statements from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\nMr. Trump reserved the right to do what he wants: \u201c@FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nUp next for the president\u2019s defense: The president of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking of Fox News, the cable news channel is touting word from Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president, that Mr. Trump did not \u201cblackmail\u201d him in July when he asked for \u201ca favor\u201d on a president-to-president phone call that is the heart of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhat Mr. Zelensky said is not exactly exonerating. As Fox News quoted him, the Ukrainian leader told reporters \u201cthere was no blackmail.\u201d But he went on to say, \u201cThey blocked this money and nobody asked us\u201d for \u201canything,\u201d an apparent reference to the hundreds of millions of military aid that Mr. Trump had frozen before the call in which he asked Ukraine for help investigating a political rival, Mr. Biden, and his son, Hunter. Mr. Trump has never acknowledged that the freeze in military aid was tied to the request for dirt, although a State Department envoy said it was in a text message to the ambassador to the European Union.", "description": "Two associates of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W.
