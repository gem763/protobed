(Photo by Don Juan Moore/Getty Images)\n\nThe Chicago Cubs have reportedly found their new manager. According to Jon Heyman and ESPN Chicago\u2019s David Kaplan, the Cubs are hiring retired catcher and current baseball analyst David Ross to replace Joe Maddon.\n\nCubs are hiring David Ross for manager \u2014 Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) October 23, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHighly placed source has confirmed to me David Ross is expected to be named Cubs manager this week. His agent has been discussing contractual terms with Theo Epstein. Deal is almost done. More on @ESPN1000 at 9 am. On @NBCSChicago + https://t.co/VqUFW8rK8r throughout the day. \u2014 David Kaplan (@thekapman) October 23, 2019\n\nRoss, 42, retired after he won a World Series ring with the Cubs in 2016. He had a 15-year career as a journeyman catcher, playing for seven different teams including the Cubs. He was almost always a backup \u2014 just once did he play in more than 100 games in a single season, and averaged just under 60 games a season over his career.\n\nWhile Ross had a long career, he\u2019s most known for his time with the Cubs. He joined the club in 2015, and announced before the 2016 season that it would be his last. His age (he was 38 in 2015) and his salt-and-pepper hair led to the clubhouse nickname \u201cGrandpa Rossy,\u201d and he was well-liked by teammates and the media.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoss has been retired for just three seasons, and in that time he\u2019s served as an analyst for ESPN and a contestant on \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d He has no managerial experience, which seems like an odd choice for a club that recently parted ways with a veteran like Joe Maddon. But Ross\u2019s relationship with the Cubs\u2019 core players could be why Theo Epstein, Chicago\u2019s president of baseball operations, decided to take a chance on him. In 2016, Ross was teammates with all 8 of the Cubs 2019 starting position players and two members of the starting rotation. Those preexisting relationships may have helped push Ross over the top for the job.\n\nOr maybe this is what pushed him over the top:\n\nPer source - one of the things that put Ross over the top for the job with the Cubs, was his strong delivery of a mock 2020 Spring Training team speech. The club asked Ross and Joe Espada to compose and deliver mock speeches for the staff during their second interviews. \u2014 Craig Mish (@CraigMish) October 23, 2019\n\nAt the very least, Cubs fans can know that their 2020 players are getting emotional, sincere speeches from their manager.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Cubs have reportedly settled on David Ross to fill their managerial vacancy.", "authors": ["Liz Roscher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4YmkasTL06Zlq2CqZxtFww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMDI0/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P0_MPfYoXWEKOWvdKaqMig--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/02bd2200-f5a1-11e9-bfff-4afa95df7652", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
