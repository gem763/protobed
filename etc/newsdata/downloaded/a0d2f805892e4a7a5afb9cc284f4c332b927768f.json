We have been preparing for this match for more than a year. It has been a big focus for us and to hold out a very tough Irish attack in the second half took courage and ability.\n\nJapan\u2019s Shizuoka Sensation against Ireland can attract new audience | Robert Kitson Read more\n\n\u201cI said before the tournament that making the last eight was our goal and I am not thinking beyond that. We could be in a situation where we lose to Scotland and miss out [as happened four years ago]. We are not getting ahead of ourselves. We have Samoa next and that is all that counts.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s head coach, Joe Schmidt said: \u201cJapan did not exceed my expectations. They met them. They showed intensity, skill and energy throughout.\n\n\u201cWe controlled the first quarter when we scored two good tries but after that we struggled to contain them.\n\n\u201cThe defeat is tough for us to take but we have to roll up our sleeves and prepare for Russia. Securing a bonus point could be really important because it puts us second in the group, a position that would put us in the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cWe were on the wrong end of the penalty count, but any concerns we have will be addressed to World Rugby, not aired in public. I have to congratulate Japan on the way they played.\u201d\n\nFull-back Rob Kearney, whose try put Ireland 12-3 ahead in the first-half, will not play against Russia on Thursday after failing a head injury assessment, while the No 8 Jack Conan will fly home having suffered a groin injury. Jordi Murphy is set to be called up in his place.\n\nIt was the fifth time Ireland had lost to World Cup hosts or co-hosts. \u201cWe were chasing shadows,\u201d said their captain, Rory Best. \u201cJapan posed a lot of questions and we could not come up with the answers. We have to dust ourselves down and get better.\u201d", "description": "Japan\u2019s head coach Jamie Joseph says his team are not getting carried away despite sealing a famous World Cup victory over Ireland", "authors": ["Paul Rees"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32783cd1ed1a2f2cb8b2d56096bf95e0a3b369a2/0_43_2066_1240/master/2066.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6dfbc7efd567a2d48f4ee2cf71e97728", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
