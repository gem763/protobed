That was the contract\u2019s highest finish since Sept. 4, according to FactSet data. Prices also tallied a gain of 4.7% for the week.\n\nThe decision from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council in China followed the U.S. decision to make adjustments to the additional tariffs to be imposed on Chinese goods on Oct. 1, Xinhua New reported Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced late Wednesday that he will delay implementing higher tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods for two weeks. In a series of tweets, Trump said the tariff hikes\u2014from 25% to 30%\u2014that were scheduled to take effect Oct. 1 will now go into effect Oct. 15.\n\nThe market has seen \u201cspeculative buying on the idea that China will be buying more U.S. pork in the future,\u201d John Payne, senior futures and options broker with Daniels Trading told MarketWatch. Still, \u201cthe report that China will exempt pork from additional tariffs doesn\u2019t mean that they are lifting tariffs.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note which contracts are moving, he said, pointing out that the rise in the October contract has been lagging behind gains in the December contract.\n\nThe more active December lean hogs contract reached the limit gain in Chicago Friday, settling up 4.5 cents, or 7%, at 68.70 cents a pound.\n\n\u201cThe idea that China will buy more pork is pricing the futures higher in the months behind the front month. The U.S. has plenty of hog/pork to meet this demand in the short term,\u201d said Payne.\n\nPrices for the most-active lean hog contracts have climbed by more than 9% year to date, down from double-digit percentage gains seen earlier this year when concerns over African swine fever (ASF), a contagious disease that is nearly 100% fatal for domestic and wild pigs, were at their peak.\n\nASF has \u201cdecimated China\u2019s hog population,\u201d said Ned Schmidt, editor of the Agri-Food Value View report. It seems that China sees imports as an answer to its pork shortage, and the U.S. \u201cis one great source.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s pork prices rose 46.7% in August, compared with a year earlier, according to a Tuesday report from the South China Morning Post, citing recent consumer price index data. That was almost double the 27% rise witnessed in July, the report said.\n\nThe record high hog prices in China, along with the tariff exemption and solid U.S. weekly exports sales to China have fueled the move higher in hog futures, said David Maloni, executive vice president of analytics at ArrowStream, a foodservice supply chain technology company.\n\nMarkets see all of this as a sign that a \u201ctipping point is near, where China will tighten the world pork supply due to the decimation of their hog herd by African Swine Fever,\u201d said Maloni. He expects the U.S. hog and pork prices to see volatility going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Payne said that China imported more pork from the U.S. in July than at any point since the 2000s.\n\nBut the problem for U.S. prices is that the \u201chog herd here has grown drastically as well,\u201d said Payne. so the \u201ctrade is tied between a massive U.S. hog herd and a cash prices that [do] not seem to have a lot of room to rally,\u201d without massive exports and this story out of Asia, he said.\n\nPayne said he doesn\u2019t see much upside for lean hog prices above the low 70s cents per pound in the December futures contract.\n\nWhat would cause prices to \u201creally jump\u201d would be a reduction of the old tariffs on U.S. pork, which were implemented during the Obama administration and remain in place, he said.\n\n\u201cWe believe hogs are a buy at some point, but it\u2019s not like buying a stock or even a commodity like corn,\u201d said Payne. \u201cYou can\u2019t store a live animal. Weights and slaughter are risky; supply is available. We need someone to buy it, and buy it soon.\u201d", "description": "Beijing\u2019s decision on Friday to exempt pork from additional tariffs on U.S. goods follows a spike in China\u2019s pork prices, as the nation continues to struggle...", "authors": ["Myra P.
