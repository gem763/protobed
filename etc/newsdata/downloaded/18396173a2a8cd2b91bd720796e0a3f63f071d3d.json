Kiara will never be replaced or forgotten. Her ashes are right by the side of Theo\u2019s cot, and we will tell him all about his sister when he\u2019s old enough.\"\n\n\u201cAug. 13 will always be a poignant date for us now, but to us, Theo is the light at the end of the tunnel,\" she said.\n\nVIRGINIA WOMAN DELIVERED SON IN BATHTUB AFTER HOSPITAL SENT HER HOME\n\nLooking back, Ineson, who has three older children, Brandon, 12, Jamielea, 11, and Harry, 9, from a previous relationship, said her labor with Kiara was fraught with difficulties.\n\nSoon after her water broke on July 29, 2018, doctors discovered Kiara had emptied her bowels while still in the womb, which can be dangerous to both mum and baby.\n\nIt was decided the safest course of action was to perform an emergency cesarean section and, in the early hours of July 30, she was born weighing 6 pounds, 5 ounces.\n\nFor 48 hours, she was kept in the hospital while doctors stabilized her, pumping her full of antibiotics in case she had swallowed any feces during labor.\n\nThen, by Aug. 1, both Kiara and Ineson were well enough to come home.\n\n\u201cI was really happy with Kiara\u2019s progress, as were the doctors. Things seemed absolutely fine. She had lovely rosy pink cheeks and was healthily gaining weight,\u201d Ineson, a stay-at-home mom, recalled. \u201cShe settled in right away at home.\u201d\n\nBut her elation soon gave way to fear when, during a routine check-up at 10 days old, a midwife noted that Kiara seemed pale, and had rapidly lost weight.\n\nWorried, Ineson and Cummins raced their daughter to the hospital, where doctors ran urgent tests, concluding that she had an infection \u2013 although they were not sure exactly what kind at first.\n\nTransferred to a more specialist hospital, for the next four days, the young parents were plunged into emotional turmoil as Kiara\u2019s oxygen levels continued to drop and the infection began to shut down her kidneys, which needed urgent dialysis to remove waste products.\n\nIn time, medics concluded that she had contracted a strain of the herpes simplex virus.\n\nTo this day, they are not sure of the exact cause, but they believe it was through a kiss, possibly from somebody who did not even know they carried the virus.\n\nAccording to The Herpes Viruses Association, many people will be unaware that they are carriers, with only one in three exhibiting symptoms that lead to a diagnosis.\n\nWith newborns, the virus can be passed on either by a kiss or by the mother if she has had genital herpes for the first time, within the last six weeks of pregnancy. The risk is significantly reduced if she has had it prior to pregnancy, as she will have passed on the necessary antibodies.\n\n\u201cBefore this, like most people, I thought of herpes as an STI,\u201d Ineson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually a virus that many people may not realize they carry. There\u2019s nowhere near enough information about herpes out there. Even those in the medical profession need to be much more aware of it, and the damage it can cause.\u201d\n\nTragically, Kiara also developed sepsis, where the body attacks itself in response to an infection, and died at just 14 days old.\n\n\"Our family all came to say goodbye, then left Thomas and I with her while, one by one, all the machines keeping her alive were removed,\" Ineson said. \u201cShe passed away at 6:32 p.m. on August 13 \u2013 the worst moment of my life. I never in my worst nightmares imagined a kiss could kill my baby.\u201d\n\nLost in grief, Kelly and Thomas faced the harrowing task of arranging their baby girl\u2019s funeral \u2013 a touching butterfly-themed service.\n\nThen, in December 2018, she had a strange urge to take a pregnancy test, which, to her amazement, turned out to be positive, despite the fact she was not actively trying to conceive.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t had any symptoms whatsoever \u2013 no sickness, no backache, no late period,\" she said. \u201cI went to the loo at home one day and spotted a pregnancy test in the bathroom cabinet. I have no idea why, but something just came over me. I can\u2019t explain it, but I thought, \u2018I should take that.\u2019\"\n\n\"Last time I'd taken one was obviously with Kiara, so it was upsetting, but exciting at the same time - really mixed emotions,\" she said. \u201cOf course, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be positive, so my jaw dropped when those two blue lines showed up.\u201d\n\nIn disbelief, she fetched Cummins, who sat with her while she took another three tests, each one displaying the same result \u2013 she was pregnant.\n\nWith her loss still so fresh, though, she was \u201cpetrified\u201d for the entire pregnancy.\n\n\u201cMy friends and family were over the moon when I told them, but I was so scared,\" she said. \u201cI was wary of every little thing I did. Towards the end, I didn\u2019t even go out. I didn\u2019t want to do anything that would put my body under stress, so Thomas and the kids did all the housework and so on. They were fantastic, but the children were also worried. They kept asking me if the same thing would happen to this baby. I tried to reassure them, but of course, deep down, I had no idea myself what would happen.\u201d\n\nAt 20 weeks, the couple discovered they were expecting a little boy.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be emotional either way, but I think it was slightly easier to deal with having a boy,\" Ineson said. \u201cOn the way to the scan, we were both so nervous. Thomas said, \u2018If it\u2019s a girl, I\u2019m going to burst into tears.\u2019 And I said, \u2018If you do, you do. It\u2019s completely natural after what we\u2019ve been through.\u2019\u201d\n\nDiscussing their options, Ineson decided with doctors to go for a planned cesarean section.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it was less risky,\u201d she added.\n\nHer due date had been August 20 but at her 36-week scan, medics agreed that her unborn baby\u2019s growth had been so healthy that he was ready to be delivered any day.\n\n\u201cThe doctor told me to expect an appointment anytime between the 6 and 13 of August. It all depended on availability,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, they came back and said to me, \u2018It\u2019ll be 13.\u2019 I told them that was Kiara\u2019s anniversary, and they offered to change it for me, but Thomas and I sat, thought and talked for ages, and eventually concluded that it was meant to be.\u201d\n\nHeading into Pinderfields General Hospital near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, first thing, Ineson was taken down to surgery just before 9 a.m. and, at 9:28 a.m., Theo was delivered weighing 7 pounds, 9 ounces.\n\nHearing his first cry, she said, was incredibly emotional.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to describe that moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThomas and I just broke down. It was so overwhelming. We had been so anxious for months. But Theo\u2019s cry showed us he was there, he was breathing, and he was alive.\"\n\n\u201cThe doctors cleaned him up then passed him to Thomas for some skin to skin contact, and his first cuddle,\" she said. \"Then, I got to hold him about 20 minutes later, once I\u2019d been stitched up. It was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nWith Theo and Ineson both deemed completely healthy, they were allowed home the next morning, with the new mom surprising her other children.\n\n\u201cI came in and Harry shouted from upstairs, \u2018Mum, what\u2019s that crying?\u2019,\" she said. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s your little brother \u2013 come meet him.' He raced downstairs, it was so sweet. The kids all love him so much. All they want to do is be near him.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow, Theo is doing well, though Ineson and Cummins remain vigilant about people not kissing him, and thoroughly washing their hands before they touch him, in a bid to prevent him suffering the same fate as Kiara.\n\nThey did not take him out of the house for around a week after he was born and do not allow people who have recently had coughs or colds to come near him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hand sanitizer all around the house. It\u2019s second nature to us and the children now,\" Ineson said. \"They know they have to use it if they want to come near Theo and hold him, and they also know not to kiss him.\"\n\nSweetly, Ineson sees glimmers of her late daughter in little Theo.\n\n\u201cHe makes all these little noises, just like Kiara used to. One of the things she was known for was her hiccups,\" she said. \"She\u2019d have these sweet bouts of them, which would always make Thomas and I laugh. If he was at work, I\u2019d FaceTime him while she hiccuped and he\u2019d have a giggle. In fact, one of the only two videos we have of Kiara is her hiccuping. So, to hear Theo do it too is almost like he\u2019s carrying on her memory.\u201d\n\nNow, Ineson is unsure of how she will mark Aug. 13 in the years to come, though this year she asked friends to release balloons in Kiara\u2019s memory as she was in the hospital.\n\nHowever, she remains determined for her daughter\u2019s death not to be in vain, and continues to work tirelessly to raise awareness of the herpes simplex virus, and urge others not to kiss people\u2019s babies.\n\n\u201cSince I went public with what happened to Kiara, I have received messages from all over the world,\" she said. \u201cEvery day, I see more people sharing my story and tagging their friends. I will do everything I can to continue to get the message out there. It\u2019s so comforting to see people sitting up and paying attention. If I can save just one life, and stop one family from going through what we have, then I will be happy.\"\n\n\u201cIn a way, I still don\u2019t feel like a grieving mum,\" she said. \"It\u2019s difficult to explain \u2013 it\u2019s almost like I haven\u2019t let it all out yet, and I am still waiting for it to hit me. But I don\u2019t want to remember the emotional times, I want to remember the happy, and even though she isn\u2019t here anymore, I\u2019m still Kiara\u2019s mum. Theo is in no way a replacement \u2013 he\u2019s his own person. He really is our little rainbow.\u201d\n\nFor information, visit herpes.org.uk", "description": "\"Theo is in no way a replacement \u2013 he\u2019s his own person.
