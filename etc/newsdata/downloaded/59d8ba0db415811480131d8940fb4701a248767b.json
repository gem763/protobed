The app's developer, HKmap.live, tweeted that it disagreed with the decision to pull the app, stating it does not \"endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe account followed that up with several other tweets, adding that it believes the decision to pull the app to be a \"bureaucratic\" decision, but one that is also \"clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right in Hong Kong.\"\n\nFollowing the second removal, Cook emailed Apple employees to defend the decision to remove the app.\n\n\u201cOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present,\u201d Cook wrote in the memo obtained by Bloomberg News.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThese decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts. In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to Fox News on Oct. 10, Apple said that it found the app was being used in nefarious ways.\n\nAPPLE WILL BUILD NEW MAC PROS IN TEXAS AMID TARIFFS\n\n\u201cWe created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it,\u201d a spokesperson told Fox News.\n\nThe spokesperson continued: \u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of October, an article in the state-owned media China Daily accused the tech giant of \"helping [Hong Kong] rioters engage in more violence\" after it reversed a decision to ban the app and reallow it, following a wave of public criticism.\n\n\"As a company with international influence, Apple has always enjoyed a high reputation,\" the article read. \"A company has its own standards of conduct, but should also have its social responsibilities. If Apple abandons its responsibilities and let violent acts get worse, it puts more users at risk.\"\n\nThe article continued: \"Business is business, and politics is politics. Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts. Apple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision.\"\n\nChina is an extremely important market for the iPhone maker, as the tech giant looks to offset slowing sales in its home market. In its most recent quarter, Greater China, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for $9.15 billion of its $53.8 billion quarterly revenue, or approximately 17 percent of quarterly revenue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has met with Chinese regulators\u00a0after the tech giant pulled a controversial app from its app store earlier this month.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AppleiPhone11Getty2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
