Dropped by a hawk?\n\n\u2018So many questions. And how does a coral snake climb the thorny rose bush!?!\u2019\n\nDoctoral student Natalie Claunch offered her take, and speculated that although coral snakes don\u2019t make good climbers, the prospect of a free meal hanging from the tree would have enticed it up.\n\nCummings then revised her theory, adding: \u2018So we\u2019ve now settled on our favorite theory: rat snake was dropped by a hawk or similar and landed in the rosebush.\n\n\u2018But the rat snake is somewhat twisted around the branches so I wonder if when it was dropped it was still partially alive and tried to free itself and could not.\u2019", "description": "Evangeline Cummings recorded the clash of predators in her garden in Gainesville, Florida", "authors": ["Jimmy Mccloskey"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571749636_1571749852.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
