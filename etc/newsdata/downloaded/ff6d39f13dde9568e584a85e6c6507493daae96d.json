When I started Katie and I spoke at length about what the right ending would be. life does sometimes take an unbelievably cruel turn, we both felt that was the most responsible way to end the story rather than, as sometimes happens in soap, people miraculously recover from a terrible illness as if it never happened. Telling the tough version was the right version to tell.\u2019\n\nHe added that playing out the story long term meant that the ending had to be done just right \u2013 which is why Corrie will be devoting several standalone episodes to Sinead\u2019s final day.\n\nIain shared: \u2018After two and a half yrs of telling a story it would be remiss of us to gallop through the end. I feel like it\u2019s something we tend to short circuit on TV \u2013 as Ken says at one point, we\u2019re used to seeing death on TV but usually an array of bad guys being mowed down by Bruce Willis -we are immune to the realities of it and scared of looking at it. The right thing to do was to spend a lot of time in that one room and see how it transpires.\u2019\n\nAnd despite it meaning that her time in Corrie has come to an end, Katie is in complete agreement with the producer that Sinead\u2019s tragic end is the right one for the drama to portray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018Life is not a fairy tale, sometimes soaps and TV tends to do the happy ending and I thought if we\u2019re doing the story we need to do it properly to raise awareness. I hope people who\u2019ve been through similar find it cathartic.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The decision was made very early on by the Corrie boss.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/00_week_43_sinead_family-7fdf_1571071581.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
