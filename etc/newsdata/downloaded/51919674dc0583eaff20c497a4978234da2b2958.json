Despite medical problems from my service years, I am still an avid traveller and booked with Rentalcars UK to collect a car from OK Rent a Car at Malaga Airport. The booking included Collision Damage Waiver (CDW).\n\nOn arrival at OK Rent a Car, it appeared there were only two customers ahead of me, so I was happy. However, I found that anyone who paid \u20ac18 (about \u00a316) could jump the queue. This rip-off meant I had to wait almost an hour. Then the agent told me my CDW was useless, and I needed to pay another \u20ac84 (about \u00a375). Feeling harassed, I paid.\n\nRip-off: The car hire firm near Malaga, above, charged an extra \u00a375\n\nWhy do car hire firms generate so many complaints? They seem to make up the rules \u2013 and their charges \u2013 as they go along. They know that anyone arriving at an airport simply wants to collect their car and leave, so they place obstacles in their way to milk them of more money.\n\nThey know that customers returning a car just want to jump on their plane and fly home, so it is easy to bill them after the event for scratches and faults that may never have existed. And I know that just by saying this, I can expect a tsunami of letters and emails from car hire customers who have been mistreated.\n\nYou gave me a copy of your booking with the firm Rentalcars and this clearly shows that CDW is included. But at Malaga Airport, the Spanish firm OK Rent a Car was anything but OK with this.\n\nIt produced a huge list of almost every car part that could possibly be damaged, with prices running into thousands of euros that you could be charged if you did not pay all over again.\n\nI asked Rentalcars what it thought of its Spanish associate describing its CDW as useless.\n\nIt told me that as far as it was concerned, the CDW was included in the price but was provided by the Spanish company, and was \u2018the standard compulsory insurance cover that is required by law across the EU\u2019.\n\nBaloney. Utter rubbish. Totally false. There is no such EU law and nor is it the law in Spain.\n\nBut Rentalcars had a further card up its sleeve. The price you paid did include CDW, but it did not include \u2018Super CDW\u2019 (SCDW). According to Rentalcars, SCDW is top-up insurance that reduces or waives your liability to pay excess charges in the event of an accident, incident or theft. So, it does what customers might have thought CDW does in the first place.\n\nRentalcars did explain that its CDW \u2018certainly is not useless\u2019. It limits the driver\u2019s liability for bodywork damage, the company told me. But SCDW covers more. In short then, the British firm says the Spanish firm was not telling you the truth \u2013 but this does not help you or get back the extra \u00a375 you were charged.\n\nI tried hard to get a comment out of Spanish firm OK Rent a Car, but it stayed silent. I expect it is too busy dreaming up a scheme to charge customers to top up their top-up. What next \u2013 Super Dooper CDW? A fair and honest car rental industry is clearly out of the question.\n\nPhone fraud is still on my file\n\nA.L. writes: I am a hard-working NHS nurse, and in 2014 was the victim of a fraud. I discovered this only last year, when my wife and I applied for a home improvement loan and the bank said there was a problem as my credit report included a default showing I owed \u00a320 to mobile phone company EE. An unknown person had used my name on a phone contract in 2014. I paid the \u00a320 simply to remove the debt from my record, but EE refuses to delete it.\n\nBills issues: Our reader has \u00a320 debt on their phone bill, but it was from someone else\n\nYou told me that you asked EE where and when you were supposed to have entered into a contract, but EE refused to answer because you could not pass its security checks. I pointed out to EE that it was absurd to insist you are a customer and a bad debtor, yet at the same time refuse to talk to you because you cannot prove you are a customer.\n\nEE has given me some details, saying that a contract was taken out in your name in June 2014, but when EE tried to collect payment a month later, it found the direct debit had been cancelled.\n\nIt suspended the account and, it says, wrote to you requesting payment. When it received nothing, it recorded a default on your credit file.\n\nHowever, although it remains convinced that it behaved correctly, EE told me that because of the age of the debt, it would remove the default notice from your credit file.\n\nThis has now been done, and you should be able to apply for credit again without any problem.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.\n\nBecause of the high volume of enquiries, personal replies cannot be given.
