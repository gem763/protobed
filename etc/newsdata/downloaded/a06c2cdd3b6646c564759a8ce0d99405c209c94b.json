Tom Cotton (R-AR) sent a scathing letter Wednesday to the Intelligence Community\u2019s Inspector General, calling Michael Atkinson\u2019s recent testimony before Congress \u201cinsolent and obstructive\u201d regarding his alleged backdating of federal \u201cwhistleblower\u201d guidelines.\n\nCotton accused Atkinson of stonewalling the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee while giving more details to the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has been a central player in the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint and his party\u2019s impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Federalist\u2019s Sean Davis explains the ongoing scandal over the complaint \u2014 including claims that Atkinson\u2019s office eliminated the requirement for \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to have a first-hand account of any wrongdoing and \u201cbackdated,\u201d or falsely documented, the change occurring earlier than it actually did:\n\nMichael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, told HPSCI lawmakers during a committee oversight hearing on Friday that the whistleblower forms and rules changes were made in September, even though the new forms and guidance, which were not uploaded to the ICIG\u2019s website until September 24, state that they were changed in August. Despite having a full week to come up with explanations for his office\u2019s decisions to secretly change its forms to eliminate the requirement for first-hand evidence and to backdate those changes to August, Atkinson refused to provide any explanation to lawmakers baffled by his behavior. When pressed on the curious changes and attempts to obscure the timeline of his revisions, Atkinson refused to explain why the forms were backdated to August even though they were not made until September. The ICIG previously stated that it changed its forms and guidance \u201cin response to recent press inquiries regarding\u201d the anti-Trump complaint, of which Congress was not even notified until the second week of September. The new forms, which were not uploaded to the ICIG website until September 24, nonetheless stated that the revisions were made back in August.\n\nCotton, who sits on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, all but accused Atkinson of obstructing justice by dodging questions on the issue.\n\n\u201cYour disappointing testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on September 26 was evasive to the point of being insolent and obstructive,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cDespite repeated questions, you refused to explain what you meant in your written report by \u2018indicia of an arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant in favor of a rival political candidate,\u2019\u201d Cotton continued. \u201cThis information is, of course, unclassified and we were meeting in a closed setting. Yet you moralized about how you were duty bound not to share even a hint of this political bias with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now I see media reports that you revealed to the House Intelligence Committee not only that the complainant is a registered Democrat, but also that he has a professional relationship with a Democratic presidential candidate,\u201d Cotton wrote. \u201cI\u2019m dissatisfied, to put it mildly, with your refusal to answer my questions, while more fully briefing the three-ring circus that the House Intelligence Committee has become.\u201d\n\nThis report comes from the Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York, who was told Atkinson testified to the House Intel Committee that the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d had \u201csome type of professional relationship\u201d with a Democratic presidential candidate. Before this story broke, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper tried to dampen the \u201cpartisan\u201d label that has stuck to this individual \u2014 reportedly a CIA official \u2014 by saying it was based only on his or her registration as a Democratic voter.\n\nCotton closed out his letter to Atkinson by posing a series of questions: \u201cDid you or anyone subject to your control or influence share with CNN that the \u2018arguable political bias\u2019 was merely that the complainant is a registered Democrat?\u201d he asked.\n\nCotton also asked Atkinson to disclose the Democratic presidential candidate with whom the complainant has a professional relationship and asked him to respond to the letter by 5 p.m. on Friday, October 11.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Sen.
