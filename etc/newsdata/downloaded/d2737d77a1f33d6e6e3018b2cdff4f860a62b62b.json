Adam Schiff, are moving the opposite way.\n\nPresident Trump and other Republicans have been complaining about Schiff\u2019s decision to hold most hearings behind closed doors, yet the Intelligence Committee chief opted for even greater secrecy in last Friday\u2019s questioning of Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine \u2014 conducting it as a deposition, which makes it a criminal offense for either side to discuss her answers.\n\nThat keeps even the rest of the House in the dark about everything except the opening statement Yovanovitch made public.\n\nSchiff is going to even greater lengths when it comes to the whistleblower whose complaint launched this whole \u2026 adventure. He might not even have the guy testify \u2014 which would remove any chance for anyone to probe his motives and biases.\n\nThis, when Schiff has admitted that, contrary to his earlier account, his staff was in touch with the whistleblower before he\u2019d even begun to file his complaint.\n\nAnd when the Washington Examiner has revealed that at least two Schiff staffers (one of them hired in the midst of the complaint filing) worked with the whistleblower at the White House back when he was advising the Obama point man on Ukraine, Veep Joe Biden.\n\nAs Politico reported in 2017, Ukrainian officials during the 2016 campaign \u201ctried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office \u2026 disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and \u2026 [and] helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\u201d What did the whistleblower, and Schiff\u2019s staffers, know about all that \u2014 and why did no one blow any whistles then?\n\nWhat are they trying to hide?\n\nSchiff doesn\u2019t want anyone to get the chance to ask.\n\nPelosi has a clear duty here: Go to the full House to pass rules so her impeachment inquiry can be more than an outright frame job.", "description": "Pelosi has a clear duty here: Go to the full House to pass rules so her impeachment inquiry can be more than an outright frame job.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/usa_maguire_testify-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
