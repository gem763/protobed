One example was captured in the November 2012 voicemail, transcribed below: De Niro: 'Chase, you are living in Spain and you\u2019re f***ing upset with me cause now you tell me how nice you have it your life over there and you f***ing don\u2019t answer my call? 'How dare you. You are absolutely fired, you\u2019re f***ing history. 'How dare you with all the good things you do this is bulls*** after Christmas. 'F*** this, how dare you f***ing disrespect me how much you did. You want a f***ing another position? You want another position. Then change and go off somewhere. 'Don\u2019t f***ing get angry with me cause I\u2019m p***ed off cause I didn\u2019t get a simple thing I need more than right now here out in California when I am here for less than 24 hours. 'You got to be f***ing kidding me you spoiled brat, f*** you! So quit whenever you want, god damn ya how can you f***ing so you don\u2019t answer you\u2019re upset cause you\u2019re living in Spain you spoiled f***ing brat.'\n\nBut Robinson's newly filed complaint argues: 'De Niro was enraged at the prospect of Ms. Robinson bringing a lawsuit challenging his behavior. So, he retaliated and struck first.'\n\nHer new suit states: 'Robert De Niro is someone who has clung to old mores. He does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals.\n\n'He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law. Ms. Robinson is a casualty of this attitude.'\n\nDe Niro's production company said a review of the books after she left found Robinson allegedly used the company's American Express card to spend tens of thousands of dollars on lavish trips, floral arrangements, iPhones, Uber rides, a Louis Vuitton handbag, dogsitters and pricey dinners.\n\nShe also allegedly used three million of De Niro's frequent flyer miles for personal trips and vacations while transferring five million to her personal account \u2014 estimated to be valued at $125,000 in total.\n\nBecause of her senior role within the company, Robinson was able to approve her own expenses, including an alleged bogus three-day LA business trip in March 2018 that allegedly turned out to be for a friend's birthday \u2014 racking up a $5,000 bill, according to De Niro's suit.\n\nIn one voicemail De Niro can be heard shouting at Robinson, calling her a 'spoiled brat,' saying 'how dare you f***ing disrespect me,' and threatening her, saying 'you're f***ing history'\n\n\n\n", "description": "Graham Chase Robinson - who is seeking $12 million in damages from De Niro - spoke through her attorney in an interview with Fox Business on Friday.", "authors": ["Andrew Court", "Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/16/19260658-0-image-a-36_1570117070146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
