All of these politicians only talk to black people every four years because they want their vote,\" Barkley said in an interview aired Wednesday.\n\nHe added that he thought Republicans didn't talk to black voters and that Democrats did \"nothing in the four years in between.\"\n\n\"Fox & Friends\" host Brian Kilmeade agreed with Barkley, and called on Republicans to further their efforts in the black community, but Diamond and Silk pointed to President Trump's actions in response.\n\n\"When it comes to the Republican party, we have a Republican president. He's not all talk, he takes action,\" Diamond said, referencing the historically low black unemployment rate and Trump's commitment to the First Step Act.\n\n\"So...Republicans don't have to pander, because they deliver...our Republican president...is delivering,\" she continued.\n\nSilk said she hoped black people would have a \"come to Jesus moment\" and that they would \"realize that the Democrat party mean black people no good.\"\n\nReiterating Diamond's support for Trump, Silk said the president is helping the black community by \"leading by example.\"\n\n\"The president is doing what he needs to do when it comes down to black people by showing people this is what you need for the black community.\"\n\n\"You need jobs so you can take care of your family,\" Silk continued, \"instead of talking about it, he's 'being about it,' and that's why black people are waking up to it.\"\n\nWhen co-host Steve Doocy observed that Barkley offered support for Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg as a 2020 candidate, Silk said she preferred to support the candidate that works towards the \"betterment of all Americans.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Anybody can support whoever they want to,\" she concluded, \"but I want to support someone that is doing something for all Americans, including black Americans.\"\n\nTo hear more from the entertaining duo, including their raw and unfiltered commentary on Fox Nation's \"Diamond and Silk offering their take on issues affecting citizens across the country, visit Fox Nation and join today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
