Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have the coveted center-stage positions, flanked by Sens. Bernard Sanders and Kamala D. Harris on either side.\n\nThe quartet has already earned a nickname of sorts from one observer.\n\n\u201cA liberal sandwich with a moderate filling. This is the first time these top contenders are all on the stage together, and it\u2019s about time we get to see them on the same night rather than staggered on different nights,\u201d writes Nate Ashworth, editor-in-chief of Election Central.\n\n\u201cBiden has got his work cut out for him, or so it would seem. He managed his way through two debates with lackluster performances and a laundry list of attacks from other candidates. None of it seemed to hurt his poll numbers or his base level of support,\u201d Mr. Ashworth continues.\n\n\u201cAt this point, if Biden makes it through the September debate and October debate without losing substantial support, what\u2019s left for his opponents to attack? He\u2019s been making campaign gaffes on the trail, but he\u2019s built up a Teflon skin when it comes to voters giving him a pass,\u201d the analyst says.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Biden carries the \u201chighest expectations\u201d for a positive appearance say Democratic primary voters writes Caitlin Oprysko, a Politico analyst.\n\nA new survey from her news organization found that 24% said Mr. Biden will give the \u201cbest performance,\u201d followed by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.\n\nTEN\u2019S A CROWD\n\nMeanwhile, how many candidates are too many candidates at the Democratic debate?\n\n\u201cMost voters \u2014 including a majority of Democratic primary voters \u2014 still believe there will be too many candidates on the stage on Thursday,\u201d reports the aforementioned Politico/Morning Consult poll.\n\nIt found that 54% of all voters say that the number of White House hopefuls \u2018is more than enough.\u201d The survey reveals that 53% of Democratic voters agree with that.\n\nThere is some tolerance here, though. A third of Democratic primary voters say the debate stage will have \u201cjust the right amount of candidates\u201d \u2014 this compared to a quarter of all registered voters.\n\nThings could get worse during the next go-round.\n\n\u201cVoters already unhappy with the size of the debate stage on Thursday are set to be disappointed: Eleven candidates have already qualified for the next debate in October, with several more on the fringes,\u201d the poll analysis said.\n\n\u201cThis virtually ensures that there will be either a larger stage or a second night of debates, as the Democratic National Committee has previously said it does not plan to feature more than 10 candidates on the same debate stage.\u201d\n\nTHE LEWANDOWSKI EFFECT\n\nThis is definitely not a case of \u201cCorey who?\u201d\n\n\u201cA new poll of New Hampshire GOP primary voters gives former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski a 20-point lead in the Republican U.S. Senate primary even before he announces his candidacy,\u201d writes Michael Graham, political editor of InsideSources.com.\n\nIt also reflects the emerging view among GOP observers that he would be the prohibitive favorite to win the nomination if and when he enters the race, he says.\n\n\u201cOur core finding is that Corey Lewandowski has a strong base near 30% and is most certainly the front-runner as of today,\u201d notes Vote Adjustments, a political strategy group. \u201cWhat is surprising is the number of people who, without prompting, know Lewandowski\u2019s name and his strong association with President Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewandowski is wisely adopting a quiet posture.\n\n\u201cThese poll numbers are very humbling. I am grateful for the support of the people of N.H. and further encouraged to enter the Senate race,\u201d he told NHJournal.com, an online source which covers the finer points of Granite State politics.\n\nRONNA\u2019S REMINDER\n\nThe news media typically downplays or completely ignores the assorted victories in the Trump administration. Now the press will also skate over Republican victories on the campaign trail \u2014 such as a rise in voter support in North Carolina following President Trump\u2019s recent appearance at a rally there \u2014 accompanied by Rep. Dan Bishop, who went on to win the seat in a special election following the event.\n\nGet used to the journalistic silence, says Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel.\n\n\u201cIt was a big win for Republicans, not just in North Carolina 9 but in the Third District as well where our candidate actually outperformed where the president did in 2016. So we had two wins on the board. You\u2019re not going to hear the Democrats talking about it. If we lost, it would be bellwether. When we win, they want to sweep it under the rug,\u201d she tells Fox News.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFox News remains the most-watched basic cable network of all for the 35th consecutive week according to Nielsen Media Research. As it has for over 17 years straight, Fox News is also the top cable news network, drawing 2.5 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.4 million for MSNBC and 869,000 for CNN.\n\nAs for recent coverage of Hurricane Dorian, Fox News averaged 1.6 million viewers, outpacing The Weather Channel as well as all its cable news rivals. Good long-term news for Fox: the network\u2019s viewership was up 8% compared to the same time last year.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 22% of U.S. voters are \u201cvery motivated\u201d to watch the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday; 8% of Republicans, 16% of independents and 40% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 28% are \u201csomewhat motivated\u201d; 18% of Republicans, 29% of independents and 37% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 17% are \u201cnot very motivated\u201d; 21% of Republicans, 17% of independents and 13% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 29% are \u201cnot motivated at all\u201d; 50% of Republicans, 31% of independents and 8% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 4% are undecided; 2% of Republicans, 7% of independents and 2% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 1,998 registered U.S. voters conducted Sept. 7-8.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
