An understandable position, given the offer was priced at a 59 per cent premium to where Bellamy's was trading immediately before the news.\n\nBut as far as the board and management are concerned, it's got something else going for it.\n\nAt the 2017 AGM, Bellamy's shareholders approved a long-term incentive package that awarded Bellamy's leaders hefty options, which would vest should they meet certain total shareholder return hurdles by 2020. But in the event of a change of corporate control, the options would vest en masse.\n\nBellamy's Organic chief Andrew Cohen stands to make a fortune on vested options should the takeover go ahead. Paul Jeffers\n\nGiven most of them have an exercise price well below the $13.25 per share China Mengnui Dairy Company is offering to pay, Bellamy's executives stand to make millions from the deal.\n\nTake CEO Andrew Cohen, who holds 51,325 ordinary shares and 1.74 million options (some secured as part of his sign-on, the rest at the 2017 AGM). Their exercise prices range from $5.643 to $14.04, so the priciest of these won't be in-the-money should the deal go ahead. But the rest would convert to $30.8 million worth of Bellamy's shares secured at a mere $15.9 million, for an immediate profit of $14.9 million. He'll make another $680,056.25 selling his ordinary shares into the deal.
