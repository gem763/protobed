Gerrit Cole dominated on the mound while Yordan \u00c1lvarez, Carlos Correa, and George Springer each contributed a two-run homer in the winning effort.\n\nJoe Ross got the start for the Nationals, filling in for the injured Max Scherzer. He was better than his final line indicated. The Astros got on the board against him in the second inning when Yuli Gurriel reached on an infield single with one out and \u00c1lvarez slugged a two-run home run to center field. All things considered, it wasn\u2019t a bad pitch. Ross hit his target with a 95 MPH sinker, but \u00c1lvarez just put a good swing on it.\n\n\u00c1lvarez, who didn\u2019t start in Games 3 or 4 due to the absence of the DH rule, continued to swing a hot bat in the fourth inning, keeping the inning alive with a two-out single. Carlos Correa promptly brought him home with a two-run homer of his own to make it 4-0. All told, Ross threw 78 pitches across five innings, allowing the four runs on five hits and a pair of walks with one strikeout.\n\nThe Nationals had Cole\u2019s number in Game 1 of the World Series, but not so much in Game 5. Cole held the opposition scoreless through six innings. Juan Soto finally put the Nationals on the board with a solo homer to center field with one out in the seventh. Cole was able to make it out of the seventh inning without any further damage, though he did have a bit of help from home plate umpire Lance Barksdale. That was Cole\u2019s final inning of work, ending the night on the hook for one run on three hits and two walks with nine strikeouts on 110 pitches.\n\nJoe Smith took over for Cole in the eighth. He worked around a leadoff Yan Gomes single with a strikeout, a line out, and a foul pop out to send the game to the ninth inning.\n\nJust for good measure, George Springer hit the Astros\u2019 third two-run homer of the night, ripping a no-doubt shot to left field off of Daniel Hudson, upping the score to 7-1. Closer Roberto Osuna had been warming up, but the added insurance turned the dial to Ryan Pressly for the bottom of the ninth. Pressly made quick work of the middle of the Nats\u2019 lineup to put the game in the books, getting Anthony Rendon to line out to right field, Soto to strike out, and Howie Kendrick to ground out.\n\nThe World Series heads back to Houston for Game 6 \u2014 and Game 7, if necessary. The two clubs will take Monday off to travel before resuming play on Tuesday. Stephen Strasburg will oppose Justin Verlander.\n\nFollow @Baer_Bill", "description": "Gerrit Cole delivered seven strong innings, helping the Astros take down the Nationals 7-1 in Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday.
