Dave Barry is now in his 70s.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist and author of such classics as \u201cBoogers are My Beat,\u201d \u201cDave Barry\u2019s Book of Bad Songs\u201d and those year-end review articles that everybody skims is, as he puts it, \u201cdefinitely getting up there.\u201d\n\nIf his life were a football game, Mr. Barry says that he\u2019d be \u201cat the two-minute warning, in the fourth quarter.\u201d If it was movie credits it would now be \u201cway down at the bottom, past assistant gerbil wrangler.\u201d If it was a bag of Cheez-Its, it would be mostly consumed, \u201cthe stage where you hold the bag up and tilt it into your mouth to get the last crumbs.\u201d\n\nIn other, less metaphorical but no less penultimate words, he explains, \u201cThe End Is in Sight.\u201d\n\nIn sight, but not yet upon him. Mr. Barry resolves to \u201cbe as happy as possible\u201d with \u201cwhatever time I have left\u201d and he enlists a spirit animal in his quest: The family dog Lucy.\n\nThe rationale for this is that, at the time of the book\u2019s writing, Mr. Barry was 70 and Lucy, a black \u201cBoxer, Dalmation, Chow Chow, Golden Retriever cross\u201d \u2014 or in plain terms, a mutt \u2014 was turning 10, putting her at rough parity with him \u201cin dog years.\u201d He thought that by examining his life through the cataracted lens of an old mutt, he just might learn some new tricks.\n\nThe chief of which was, of course, how to be happy. Lucy is an affable, contented dog and good at living in the moment. Mr. Barry is frets about the past and worries about the future. He finds that as he has gotten older, he has also gotten meaner and less social.\n\nIn each of seven main chapters, Mr. Barry looks at his life and eventually compares himself to Lucy. He extracts such lessons as \u201cdon\u2019t stop having fun\u201d; \u201cpay attention to the people you love\u201d; and \u201cdon\u2019t lie unless you have a really good reason, which you probably don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThere is plenty of ranting and storytelling along the way. We learn about how Dave Barry was tied in knots by an audit by the IRS and how Lucy would have handled it differently. (Some agents would have gotten licked.) We either chuckle or groan (I chuckled) as he rants against the AARP\u2019s attempts to make aging cool. (\u201cAARP, as you probably know, is the last sound you make before you die.\u201d)\n\nAnd we nod knowingly as he describes things that many of us have observed, such as road rage, disposing of things we don\u2019t want to eat without offending the hostess, and the absurdity of high school dating rituals.\n\nIn short, most of the book is the kind of writing that fans of Dave Barry\u2019s columns and non-fiction books have come to expect: Funny, punchy, absurd and even a little bit insightful.\n\nAnd now I have to spoil something big because it slowed me up from finishing this book, which I had been reading to the missus at night. Here is the spoiler: The dog doesn\u2019t die.\n\nI believed that was going to be the case because an afterword begins \u201cThis chapter wasn\u2019t supposed to be here\u201d and I shuffled forward a few pages and picked out words like \u201cMRI\u201d and \u201cparalyzed\u201d and put the book away before it gave my dog-loving wife nightmares.\n\nWhen I picked it up again, I learned that \u201cLessons From Lucy\u201d was done and scheduled to be published but had to be delayed because Mr. Barry\u2019s still teenage daughter, Sophie, woke up one day and couldn\u2019t move her legs.\n\nShe had been accepted into Duke and all set to move there and this book had a national publicity tour lined up. Both had to be shelved as the Barrys spent 40 days in the hospital, as doctors struggled, successfully, to rescue Sophie from an aggressive auto-immune disorder called Transverse Myelitis.\n\nMr. Barry writes movingly about this struggle. \u201cIt\u2019s an especially cruel kind of torture, to watch, helpless, as your child suffers. You would do anything to make it better. Every parent knows this: You would gladly, in an instant, trade places with your child. Take me. Paralyze me. But you don\u2019t get that choice,\u201d he says.\n\nThat\u2019s yet another thing that Dave Barry is not making up.\n\n\u2022 Jeremy Lott is creator and writer of the Movie Men comic book.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nLESSONS FROM LUCY: THE SIMPLE JOYS OF AN OLD, HAPPY DOG\n\nBy Dave Barry\n\nSimon & Schuster, $26, 225 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
