The documentary highlighted what it saw as misconduct by the then-government of Park Geun-hye.\n\nThe festival was told to withdraw the film but kept it on the program and then faced budget cuts and criminal charges filed against senior management. The matter was only really resolved with the arrival of the government of Moon Jae-in in 2017.\n\n\"When Busan was under political suppression many international film people showed their support and I was one of them,\" said Kore-eda. \"Now, after all those years of difficulty Busan has been able to come this far. That's why I am able to visit this day. Back then solidarity with Busan showed it could endure through the problems it was having with politics. And I hope we can do the same today.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old BIFF has long championed Kore-eda's work and the filmmaker believes this helped people from the two nations understand more about each other over the years.\n\n\"Film brings us together and reveals things about each other that we all share,\" said Kore-eda who sent a video message to BIFF on opening night before arriving in Busan early Saturday.\n\nThe 57-year-old won the prestigious Palme d'Or last year for his family drama \"Shoplifters\", a cutting look at a family living on the edges of Japanese society.\n\nHe has returned to BIFF this year with the family drama \"The Truth\", his first non-Japanese feature. It stars iconic French actresses Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche and swirls around a emotional family reunion and the publishing of an error-strewn memoir. Hollywood A-lister Ethan Hawke also features as the son-in-law.\n\n\"This process of working overseas with overseas actors was very different for me,\" said Kore-eda. \"But I think people all over the world are interested in the same types of stories.\"\n\nBIFF runs until Oct 13.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Cannes Palme d'Or-winning Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda says he has come to South Korea to show \"solidarity\" with his fans and fellow filmmakers as governments in Seoul and Tokyo fight out a bitter trade war. \"Through showing support for each other we can solve and overcome these political problems,\" Kore-eda\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/9d/22/c16ee6217bb3e300eb7ec68c2378ec071b3b/9d22c16ee6217bb3e300eb7ec68c2378ec071b3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
