All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nThe \u201clynching\u201d comment prompted swift condemnation. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a Democrat and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, said: \u201cThat is one word no president ought to apply to himself. That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\"\n\nDoug Jones, the Democratic senator for South Carolina, wrote: \"No sir! No, Donald Trump: this is NOT a lynching, and shame on you for invoking such a horrific act that was used as a weapon to terrorize and murder African Americans.\"\n\nThere was also criticism from Mr Trump\u2019s own party. Kevin McCarthy, the most senior Republican in the House who is usually a prominent defender of the president, said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that language. Pretty simple.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s beyond shameful to use the word \u201clynching\u201d to describe being held accountable for your actions. https://t.co/WS1yPy8CIE \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 22, 2019\n\nTim Scott, the only black Republican senator, likened impeachment to a \u201cpolitical death-row trial\u201d but said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t use the word lynching\u201d.\n\nMitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, also criticised the president, saying: \"Given the history in our country, I would not compare this to a lynching. That was an unfortunate choice of words.\"\n\nHowever Mr Trump also had defenders. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator for South Carolina and confidante of the president, said: \u201cThis is a lynching in every sense.\"\n\nHe said the Democratic behaviour amounted to \u201cmob rule\u201d, which is \u201cwhat lynching is all about\u201d.\n\nHogan Gidley, the White House deputy press spokesman, sought to disconnect the phrase from its historical context. \"The president\u2019s not comparing what\u2018s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history. He\u2019s just not,\u201d he said.\n\nThousands of African-Americans were killed in lynchings between the late 1880s and 1960s, during a dark period of American history after slavery was abolished but when segregation was in practice.\n\nIt is not the first time Mr Trump\u2019s language on race has provoked controversy. His call for four Democratic congresswomen of colour to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came originally from \u2013 despite three being born in America \u2013 was widely condemned as racist.\n\nIn the past he has reportedly called African countries \u201cs--tholes\u201d and likened the influx of migrants into America to an \u201cinvasion\u201d.\n\nBill Taylor, the top US diplomat to Ukraine, arrives at a closed session on Capitol Hill Credit: Alex Wong/Getty Images More", "description": "Donald Trump faced a fierce backlash yesterday as Democrats and some Republicans condemned his tweet comparing the impeachment inquiry to a \u201clynching\u201d.\u00a0 The US president used the phrase, synonymous with the white racist mobs who murdered black people during a deadly chapter in US history, as he called", "authors": ["Ben Riley-Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ly4lFbhZy7X7GpnlNAo6_A--~B/aD0xNTY0O3c9MjUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/98c5edb07a8e0e4291d9ad99f40368eb", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
