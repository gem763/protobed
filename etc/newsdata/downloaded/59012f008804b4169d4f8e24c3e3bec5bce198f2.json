Those teams were meeting in their own Game 5 at Dodger Stadium. It will be St. Louis\u2019 first NLCS trip since 2014.\n\nFor the Braves, it might take a while to get over this debacle.\n\nAfter pitching seven scoreless innings in a Game 2 win, Mike Foltynewicz retired only one hitter before getting yanked. First baseman Freddie Freeman made a crucial error that might have limited the damage. The Cardinals scored their final run of the inning on a strikeout - a wild pitch in the dirt that skipped away from catcher Brian McCann.\n\nIt was Atlanta\u2019s 10th straight postseason round loss since their last victory 18 long years ago, tying the ignominious mark set by the Chicago Cubs between 1908 and 2003.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Howie Kendrick hit a tiebreaking grand slam off Joe Kelly in the 10th inning, and the Washington Nationals overcame a three-run deficit with a late rally to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 Wednesday night and advance to the NL Championship Series against St. Louis.\n\nThree-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw blew a 3-1 lead by allowing homers to Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto on consecutive pitches in the eighth.\n\nThe wild-card Nationals open the NLCS at St. Louis on Friday night. The seven-time defending NL West champion Dodgers, who led the NL with 106 wins, remain without a World Series title since 1988.\n\nAdam Eaton walked against Kelly leading off the 10th, Rendon doubled on a drive that lodged in the left field wall and Soto was intentionally walked.\n\nKendrick hit a 97 mph fastball just over the wall in center for his second career slam. The other one was a game-ending, 11th-inning drive against San Francisco in August 2017.\n\nDaniel Hudson got the win. Sean Doolittle pitched the 10th for the Nationals.\n\nATLANTA (AP) - The Atlanta Braves did not distribute their traditional red foam tomahawks to fans before Wednesday\u2019s Game 5 of their NL Division Series against the Cardinals following criticism by St. Louis pitcher Ryan Helsley.\n\nThe foam cutouts are used when Braves fans perform their Tomahawk Chop chant in games.\n\nThe Braves said in a statement the change is \u201cout of respect for the concerns\u201d expressed by Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation who said he finds the chant insulting.\n\nFans still used the chant with the Cardinals\u2019 first batter, Dexter Fowler, at the plate. It didn\u2019t bring the Braves good luck. Starting pitcher Mike Foltynewicz recorded only one out as the Cardinals took a 10-0 first-inning lead.\n\nThe Braves said they were taking several steps to \u201creduce the Tomahawk Chop during our in-ballpark presentation today.\u201d The team said it would not play the music that accompanies the chant when Helsley is in the game.\n\nNFL\n\nOakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict\u2019s appeal to overturn his suspension for the rest of the season for a helmet-to-helmet hit was denied Wednesday.\n\nAppeals officer Derrick Brooks ruled he would not reduce the longest suspension ever handed down for an on-field infraction. Brooks is appointed jointly by the NFL and the NFLPA and heard Burfict\u2019s appeal of the ban for the final 12 games of the regular season and the playoffs.\n\nBrooks upheld the decision handed down last week by NFL Vice President of football operations Jon Runyan to punish Burfict severely for \u201crepeated violations of unnecessary roughness rules\u201d after the latest hit on Indianapolis tight end Jack Doyle on Sept. 29. It was the third time Burfict has been suspended for a dangerous hit on the field to go along with several others that led to fines.\n\nJACKSONVILLLE, Fla. (AP) - Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey practiced for the first time in three weeks Wednesday, rejoining teammates two days after seeing a back specialist.\n\nRamsey participated in a limited capacity, taking part in individual drills before spending the rest of the session working with team trainers on the side.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ramsey plays Sunday against New Orleans (4-1) and the NFL\u2019s leading receiver, Michael Thomas.\n\nNHL\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo Sabres rookie forward Victor Olofsson has tied an NHL record in becoming the fourth player to score each of his first six career goals on the power play.\n\nOlofsson made it six in a row with a one-timer off Jack Eichel\u2019s pass into the right circle to open the scoring 5:04 into the first period against Montreal on Wednesday night. The Swede\u2019s streak dates to the end of last season, when he scored twice in two games.\n\nWinnipeg\u2019s Craig Norwich in 1979-80, Hartford\u2019s Sylvain Turgeon in 1983-84 and Islanders\u2019 Jeff Norton, from 1987-88 to 1989-90, share the record.\n\nNicknamed \u201cGoal-ofsson\u201d by Sabres fans, the 24-year-old Olofsson was selected in the seventh-round of the 2014 draft. He spent five seasons playing in the Swedish Elite League before signing with the Sabres in April 2018.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Former Sharks longtime captain Patrick Marleau is returning to San Jose where he is the franchise leader in five major categories, signing a one-year contract Wednesday.\n\nAn unrestricted free agent who is a three-time All-Star, Marleau recorded 84 points with 43 goals and 41 assists in 164 games over the past two seasons with the Maple Leafs.\n\nMarleau, who turned 40 last month, spent his initial 19 seasons with the Sharks and they made the playoffs in 17 of those years. Marleau served as captain from 2003-09. He will certainly be a fan favorite once more.\n\nHe ranks first in franchise history for points (1,082), goals (508), power-play goals (160), game-winning goals (98) and games played (1,493). His 574 assists are second-most in Sharks franchise history.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - A colt was fatally injured at Keeneland in a crash that also left his jockey Adam Breschizza with an injured left clavicle.\n\nThe death of Triggerman is the track\u2019s third since the fall meet opened on Friday.\n\nKeeneland says in a statement that Triggerman injured his front left leg in a 1-mile turf race on Wednesday. It did not specify where the 3-year-old bay colt was euthanized, but the race chart said he \u201cwent wrong late in the stretch\u201d and was vanned off.\n\nKeeneland medical director Barry Schumer says Breschizza was stable upon being discharged from the track\u2019s first aid station. The rider, who has three Grade 3 victories this year, was transported to the University of Kentucky\u2019s Chandler Hospital for evaluation.\n\nCOURTS\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Hall of Fame basketball coach Jim Calhoun has been accused of sexual discrimination by a former associate athletic director at the University of Saint Joseph, the Division III school where Calhoun now works.\n\nJaclyn Piscitelli filed a lawsuit Wednesday in U.S. District Court against the small Catholic school in West Hartford, which began admitting men in 2018.\n\nShe alleges she was fired after complaining about the conduct of men in the athletic department, including the 77-year-old Calhoun, after he was hired to form and coach the school\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team.\n\nShe alleges, among other things, that the former UConn coach once called her \u201chot\u201d and on another occasion forced her to clean up coffee grounds he spilled, telling her it was something his wife would do for him.\n\nA spokeswoman says Saint Joseph \u201ctakes compliance with all matters relating to Title IX very seriously.\u201d\n\nOBITUARY\n\nARCADIA, Calif. (AP) - Sherwood C. Chillingworth, a longtime executive with the Oak Tree Racing Association who had partnerships in several stakes-winning thoroughbreds, has died. He was 93.\n\nChillingworth had been in declining health and died Tuesday of undisclosed causes, Frank DeMarco, vice president and general counsel at Santa Anita, said Wednesday. They were friends for over 70 years.\n\nChillingworth was named an Oak Tree director in 1989 and assumed the title of executive vice president for the not-for-profit organization four years later.\n\nOak Tree began in 1969 and conducted its last fall meet at Santa Anita in 2009. It operated for one year at Hollywood Park and held fall meets at Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton through last year. The organization remains active in funding charitable causes.\n\nA former real estate developer, Chillingworth served as vice chairman and CEO of Santa Anita Realty Enterprises from 1994-96.\n\nHe owned and raced thoroughbreds dating to the early 1970s under his operation named Paniolo Ranch.\n\nMADRID (AP) - Andr\u00e9s Gimeno, the Spanish tennis player who became the oldest man to win the French Open in the professional era, has died. He was 82.\n\nThe Spanish tennis federation says Gimeno died Wednesday following a long illness.\n\nGimeno was 34 years and 301 days old when he won the French Open in 1972, beating Patrick Proisy in the final.\n\nHe had made the Australian Open final three years earlier but lost to Rod Laver.\n\nRafael Nadal, the 12-time French Open champion, said on Twitter that Gimeno \u201cwas without a doubt one of the pioneers of tennis in Spain.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "MLB", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
