He told Inside Out on BBC West: \u201cMost people haven\u2019t lived anywhere on their own and halls can be quite a nice transition period but we don\u2019t have that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been thrown out into the wind.\u201d\n\nGrace Whittaker, another student who had no accommodation, was told that there was housing in Langford, in North Somerset, and in Newport \u2013 which is more than 30 miles away and in a different country.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf you know how big the courses are, you know how many spaces you have for students and you know how many halls you have for students \u2013 so why give out so many offers and why let people through clearing if we are not going to have accommodation?\u201d\n\nA record number of students across the country took up places on degrees through clearing this year.\n\nCompetition between universities to recruit students, who pay \u00a39,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population and yet student numbers at institutions remain uncapped.\n\nUniversities across the UK have been expanding in recent years \u2013 and the number of students at Bristol has risen by 15 per cent in three years, from 21,555 in 2014-15 to 24,850 in 2017-18.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Especially in first year it felt as if everyone was pushing into each other to sit there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to stretch each course as much as possible.\u201d\n\nMr Braakman added that he thought the university was accepting too many people \u2013 similar to airlines overbooking flights.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf I knew about the housing situation in Bristol, if it was transparent that there was not much accommodation in general, then I wouldn\u2019t choose Bristol.\u201d\n\nMr Bemrose told The Independent: \u201cThere are still a number of postgraduate and Erasmus students who are struggling to find accommodation in the private market.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still think there is work that needs to be done to ensure all students are getting the help they need,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to prevent a similar situation happening in the future.\u201d\n\nEva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: \u201cThe fact that flying to and from university is a cheaper and simpler option than renting is a damning example of the housing crisis students are facing.\n\n\u201cUniversities are simply not doing enough to ensure all their students have access to affordable, safe and decent accommodation from the start.\u201d\n\nSarah Purdy, who is responsible for student wellbeing at the University of Bristol, said she was \u201creally sorry\u201d to hear students were anxious about a lack of accommodation.\n\nBut she said the process was similar each year and it will be \u201csame in every university\u201d in the UK.\n\nMs Purdy added: \u201cI think this year there were larger numbers of students involved in the process in part because we had fewer students who decided to defer or withdraw from the guaranteed offer.\u201d\n\nBut she insisted that the university had not \u201clet students in, over and above the numbers\u201d it had planned to admit.\n\nA University of Bristol spokesperson said: \u201cColleagues in our accommodation team have been working incredibly hard over the past few weeks to individually support those students who were not part of the 6,000 students we have already placed in university-owned or university-managed accommodation.\n\n\u201cAs each day has passed we have managed to bring down the number still looking for suitable accommodation and before our students started to arrive this weekend we were able to offer every student accommodation in Bristol or at our Langford campus.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cWe believe our website and the information we supply to students gaining a place at Bristol is clear about the accommodation we can offer and the processes we follow. We are sorry if Sohail or any other student feels it is not clear.\n\n\u201cWe always look to see where our processes can be improved and we will review our communications as part of this.\u201d", "description": "A student is considering flying to Bristol from Amsterdam every week for his postgraduate course after failing to secure housing through the university. \u00a0 Sohail Braakman, a University of Bristol\u00a0student,\u00a0said he had applied to the institution on the premise that postgraduate accommodation would be available in the city.
