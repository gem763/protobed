But the innovation comes as regulators and large financial institutions are examining digital currencies following the announcement of Libra by Facebook and a technology consortium.\n\nThe creation of Black will allow Marketlend investors to buy asset tokens on its blockchain, and manage loan contracts on the platform. The digital process will facilitate liquidity and lift transparency because records of investors' holdings can be viewed over Ethereum and verified.\n\nInitially, access to Black will be restricted to investors on Marketlend's platform, but Mr Tyndall said it could offer it to the wider market.\n\nGraeme Moore, head of tokenisation at Polymath, said he expects a proliferation of financial market applications for crypto-assets in the next three to 12 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven the size of the markets they operate in, the big investment banks won't be the leaders with rolling this out, but they will closely be watch innovation in start-ups, and if these small market use-cases prove themselves, then I expect significant scaling up worldwide,'' he said.\n\nPossible trillion-dollar markets that could develop tokenisation processes include those for cross-border payments, inter-bank lending and foreign exchange, Mr Moore said.\n\n\u201cAll these markets are being made more cost effective using blockchain, which will touch all of them in some way\".\n\nHe said banks that grasp what is happening would profit from the more efficient processes, while those who continue to \"send out pieces of paper to people\", would become irrelevant.", "description": "Marketlend has an online marketplace for small business loans, its new digital currency called Black will be backed one-to-one with the Australian dollar.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.5439%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_799%2C$y_679/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/994a001873143c436155fe6dac94cdbc65260db4", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
