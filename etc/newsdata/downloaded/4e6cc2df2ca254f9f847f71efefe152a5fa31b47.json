Thirty-year-old Avi Berkowitz has landed a very big job.\n\nBefore his promotion this week to a leading role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, 30-year-old Avi Berkowitz filled a number of odd jobs in the West Wing. They have included shepherding distinguished visitors \u2014 the likes of Kim Kardashian, Jeff Bezos, Sheldon Adelson \u2014 around the White House, and hanging onto Jared Kushner\u2019s phone while Kushner is in meetings, a duty that sometimes had Berkowitz responding to messages on his boss\u2019 behalf.\n\n\u201cThere are times when people think they\u2019re texting with Jared, but they\u2019re actually texting with Avi,\u201d said one former White House official, who recalled thinking, \u201cHoly crap\u201d when witnessing Berkowitz reading an incoming message from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on Kushner\u2019s phone. (Berkowitz and Kushner dispute this. \u201cI have never texted anyone from Jared\u2019s phone nor do I read his messages,\u201d said Berkowitz. \u201cAnyone who says otherwise is mistaken.\u201d)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn his new role, Berkowitz will be perceived, more so than his predecessor, as an extension of Kushner, who has employed the young Harvard Law School graduate in various capacities since 2012. In 2017, Trump tapped his son-in-law to develop the administration\u2019s plan to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict, which the president has called \u201cthe ultimate deal.\u201d\n\nBut those efforts have foundered as the White House has continually delayed the release of the plan\u2019s details, while both sides of the conflict have dug into entrenched positions.\n\nWhat scant hopes there were of success evaporated further on Thursday when The New York Times first reported that special envoy for Middle East peace Jason Greenblatt was resigning, and the White House announced that Berkowitz, in conjunction with Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative on Iran, would be taking on his duties.\n\nWhite House officials insisted that Greenblatt was stepping down to spend more time with his family after a grueling travel schedule, but his approach to the conflict differed markedly from Kushner\u2019s. Early in his tenure, Greenblatt made efforts to meet with Palestinian leaders, while Kushner slammed them as \u201chysterical and erratic\u201d in July when they boycotted a conference on economic development in Bahrain.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

The White House is still sorting out the details of the shake-up, but Berkowitz will retain some of his current duties while taking on his new role. It is still being determined whether Berkowitz, currently a deputy assistant to the president, will get a new title.\n\nThe young aide \u2014 widely described as quiet and intelligent \u2014 has been steeped in the details of the peace process from the start, and administration officials say he has taken an increasingly substantive role in it over time. But seasoned diplomats greeted news of his elevation with incredulity.\n\n\u201cAvi Berkowitz cannot fulfill Jason Greenblatt\u2019s role in this situation,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, who worked on Bill Clinton\u2019s attempts to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict as a top member of the president\u2019s negotiating team. \u201cMy takeaway from this is that I\u2019m not sure frankly that anyone on this team, including Avi Berkowitz, believes that this initiative has any chance of actually creating a framework that would allow Israelis and Palestinains to negotiate, let alone reach any type of agreement.\u201d\n\nMartin Indyk, who served as special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotations under Barack Obama, called the move a \u201cdowngrade.\u201d\n\nSome of the naysayers come from within Trump\u2019s own camp. \u201cPeople will walk past his desk and he constantly has the Drudge Report and Twitter up. No one thinks of him as a policy person,\u201d said an administration official, who noted another of Berkowitz\u2019s duties: handling Kushner\u2019s press relations in the aftermath of former Kushner spokesman Josh Raffel\u2019s departure from the White House early last year.\n\n\u201cHe is in the service of Jared, not Trump,\u201d this person said. \u201cSome people are scratching their heads to watch this guy go from keeping Jared\u2019s schedule and secrets to brokering peace in the Middle East. It\u2019s a big leap.\u201d\n\n\u201cJared listened to Jason. Jared trusted Jason\u2019s insight into the lay of the land, and also how to negotiate things, and navigate things,\u201d said a former White House official who, by contrast, described the working relationship early on between Kushner and Berkowitz as, \u201cJared saying, \u2018Go get my coffee,\u2019 and Avi saying, \u2018I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019\u201d\n\nTop administration officials stress that Berkowitz will not be shouldering Greenblatt\u2019s role on his own, and argue that he is more familiar with the plan than an external hire would be.\n\n\u201cI do think he is qualified to do what\u2019s expected of him, and it will continue to be very much a team approach kind of place. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cHe\u2019s developed quite a good relationship with the relevant Middle East ambassadors and diplomats. He interacts with them a lot because of his role with Jared and when I\u2019ve seen those interactions, they\u2019ve been very positive.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter for The Telegraph whether he had confidence in Berkowitz, Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu responded, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nBerkowitz met Kushner in 2011 while playing basketball at a Passover celebration in Arizona, and began working for him at Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm, the next year, after graduating from Queens College in New York.\n\nLike Kushner, Berkowitz is an Orthodox Jew with close ties to Israel. He is fluent in Hebrew, and in his late teens went to live and study in the country for two years. And like his mentor, Berkowitz is skinny and clean-cut, which has helped him earn the nickname \u201cmini-me.\u201d\n\nAfter enrolling at Harvard Law School, Berkowitz continued to work for Kushner in the summers, and he began contributing to Kushner\u2019s New York Observer, writing on campus controversies at Harvard \u2014 including one in which a student drew charges of anti-Semitism for describing an Israeli official as \u201csmelly\u201d \u2014 and the pros and cons of various private jet services.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The episode was scrutinized in the Mueller report.\n\nAt the White House, he has continued to bond socially with Kushner while supporting him in a variety of capacities. One official recalled Kushner and Berkowitz beating since-departed aides Johnny McEntee and Keith Schiller in a game of two-on-two basketball on the White House grounds early in Trump\u2019s term.\n\nIn a 2017 Business Insider profile, then-White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks described Berkowitz\u2019s role as fetching coffee and performing other administrative tasks. But his portfolio has expanded dramatically as the administration has worn on.\n\n\u201cHis role generally has been growing as he learned the material,\u201d said Trump\u2019s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who praised Berkowitz for putting in 18-hour days.\n\n\u201cThey just did not pick Avi out of the basement in the White House to throw into this job,\u201d said Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\nEmeritus Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, a staunch Israel supporter and outside legal adviser to Trump, spent two days holed up at the White House in July 2018, reviewing the peace plan with Kushner and Greenblatt.\n\nDershowitz praised Berkowitz, who also attended the meetings, saying he was immersed in the details of the plan and contributed to the discussion. \u201cClearly, he was the low man on the totem pole in that room. He was the guy if you had to send him out for something you could send him out,\u201d Dershowitz said. \u201cBut his substantive ideas were there.\u201d\n\nDershowitz declined to discuss the specifics of those talks, but he said Berkowitz was especially attuned to the diplomatic realities of the region. \u201cHe was always thinking about not only what would be good in the plan, ideally, but what would be acceptable to the Palestianians, what would be acceptable to the Saudis\u201d and other regional powers, he recalled.\n\nThis spring, when Netanyahu found himself unable to assemble a governing coalition, Dershowitz said Berkowitz sought his advice in follow-up phone calls, as the administration weighed delaying the plan\u2019s release in response to Israel\u2019s political turmoil.\n\nThe group did decide to push back the release of the as-yet unseen plan, and Greenblatt, who has six children, decided to return to the private sector rather than stay on.\n\nBerkowitz\u2019s promotion is the latest sign that well past the midpoint of Trump\u2019s first term, the White House has grown increasingly reliant on a shrinking group of loyalists.\n\n\u201cCould you pull some Middle East expert out of some university or out of a prior diplomatic role? Sure,\u201d said a former senior administration official. \u201cBut that whole team isn\u2019t going to trust them. It\u2019s so sensitive.\u201d\n\nDennis Ross, who served as Bill Clinton\u2019s Middle East envoy, interpreted Greenblatt\u2019s departure as a sign that the Trump administration does not expect its forthcoming peace plan -- which is set to be released at some unspecified point after Israel\u2019s Sept. 17 elections \u2014 to lead even to follow-up negotiations.\n\nA White House official contested this interpretation, saying, \u201cWe get criticized all the time by the people who worked on this for a long time and failed.\u201d\n\nBut if the plan is in fact dead on arrival, Ross said, Berkowitz will be left with something of a mop-up job, tasked with finding areas for incremental progress and trying to prevent the plan\u2019s release from deepening the conflict.\n\n\u201cHis challenge will be in the aftermath of the release of the plan to try to make sure you can manage the situation,\u201d said Ross, who this month published a book, \u201cBe Strong and of Good Courage,\u201d about the Israel-Palestine conflict. \u201cWhen you have a sense of hopelessness out there, that doesn\u2019t make stability more likely.\u201d\n\nIt promises to be a much more daunting task than keeping Kushner caffeinated, which for the record, one White House official disputed was ever part of Berkowitz\u2019s official duties.\n\n\u201cFetching coffee is not one of Avi\u2019s responsibilities at the White House, nor has it ever been,\u201d the official said. \u201cHowever, if you\u2019re thirsty, he is always happy to help.\u201d", "description": "Thirty-year-old Avi Berkowitz has landed a very big job.", "authors": ["Ben Schreckinger", "Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/12/99/9ba3b7bb4a1c8c486345bc89b99a/190906-berkowitz-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
