REUTERS/Tom Westbrook\n\n\u201cIn Australia our focus is on fully utilizing our Ichthys LNG facilities while creating a solid base for future expansion,\u201d Inpex\u2019s president director for Australia, Hitoshi Okawa, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.\n\nInpex completed construction last year on its first LNG project, the $45 billion Ichthys LNG project in Darwin at the north end of Australia, and shipped its first LNG cargo last October.\n\nProduction at Ichthys LNG, Japan\u2019s biggest foreign investment, has rapidly climbed toward its full capacity of 8.9 million tonnes a year (mtpa), quicker than typical for LNG projects, especially for a company building its first one, consultants Wood Mackenzie said.\n\n\u201cThe ramp-up of our operation is going very well,\u201d Okawa said, adding that he expects to be able to declare soon that it has reached full capacity. The original plan was to reach plateau production within two to three years of start-up.\n\nAs of Friday, the company had shipped 78 LNG cargoes from Ichthys, as well as 18 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cargoes and 36 condensate cargoes, he said.\n\nWhile Ichthys has operated smoothly, construction of the plant was plagued by delays, with the first LNG cargo in October 2018 nearly two years behind schedule. The project\u2019s cost blew out by 32% to $45 billion.\n\nInpex set out in its \u201cVision 2040\u201d to become a top-10 global oil company and a major gas company in Asia and Oceania, paving the way for expansion in Australia, alongside its three other core areas of Japan, Indonesia and Abu Dhabi.\n\nInpex has space to add four LNG production units, called trains, at Ichthys LNG and has five points along its 890 kilometer (553 mile) pipeline from the Ichthys field to Darwin where pipelines from new gas fields could be tied in.\n\nGas for any expansion of Ichthys could come from offshore fields or from Inpex\u2019s acreage in the promising Beetaloo shale basin in the Northern Territory, where the company is going through the approval process to start exploring, Okawa said.\n\nThe company recently won approval to explore over 14,000 square kilometers in waters off northwestern Australia.\n\n\u201cOur target is oil,\u201d Okawa said. \u201cIt\u2019s very large acreage. First we\u2019ll do the seismic then we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nExpansion in Australia could also involve acquisitions, Okawa said, including potentially a stake in Thai PTT Exploration and Production\u2019s (PTTEP.BK) Cash Maple gas field off northwestern Australia.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, we would not rule out any opportunity to meet with our Vision 2040,\u201d Okawa said, when asked about the Cash Maple opportunity.", "description": "Inpex Corp <1605.T>, Japan's top oil and gas company, wants to expand in Australia at its Ichthys liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and through potential acquisitions, as part of a plan to become a major regional gas company, its Australian boss said.", "authors": ["Sonali Paul", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429368717&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0LK", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
