Photos showed large gaping holes in the side of the house and walls that had been blown out by explosives.\n\nAn armed shoplifting suspect who fled from police at a nearby Walmart had randomly invaded the home and barricaded himself in a bathroom in June 2015. A 19-hour standoff resulted in the home being completely destroyed, costing Mr. Lech $400,000 in out-of-pocket expenses to rebuild, he told The Post.\n\n\u201cThis has ruined our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nGreenwood Village responded to the incident by offering the Lech family $5,000 in temporary rental assistance and for the insurance deductible. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit unanimously ruled that the city owes the Lech family nothing further, saying it was acting within its \u201cpolice power\u201d when it damaged the home.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show that they can blow up your house, throw you out on the streets and say, \u2018See you later. Deal with it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lech told The Post. \u201cWhat happened to us should never happen in this country, ever.\u201d\n\nHe said he is considering taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
