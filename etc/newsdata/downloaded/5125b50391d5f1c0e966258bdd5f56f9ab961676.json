My Neighbours The Dumplings sounds like a post-post-punk group featuring Jah Wobble and ex-members of Gang of Four. It also sounds like a disrespectful jibe about the people over the fence post-Christmas.\n\nBut My Neighbours The Dumplings, which opened in Clapton, east London, some years back, and which has recently opened a second, roomier restaurant in Victoria Park, Hackney, is in fact named after the 1998 cult Japanese anime film My Neighbour Toroto. That has to be the most impudently east-London thing I\u2019ll write in 2019, but there are 11 weeks left.\n\nThree years ago, with that brilliant name acting as catnip, I fought my way into Kristian Leontiou and Becky Wharton\u2019s first dumpling and sake bar to find the place in absolute bedlam. Delicious, homespun, sort-of-Chinese, sort-of-Korean, a-little-Vietnamese bedlam. But also the sort of bedlam that sets in when your pop-up events and baskets of crisp, chewy, courgette and wood-ear mushroom potstickers are a sell-out success and Nigella\u2019s been in for a plate of your prawn har gow. It was the sort of bedlam that brings all the cool kids to the melee, like wasps to jam, and turns your waiting area into a 50-minute queue for smacked cucumber and turnip cake. I remember leaving feeling that it was wonderful, and that drinking sake cocktails in its pot-plant jungle was a real coup, but still, I\u2019d eaten dinner with one bum cheek on a stranger\u2019s thigh and my elbow in their peanut salad.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Soothing and unusual\u2019: marinated silken tofu with preserved vegetables at My Neighbours the Dumplings, London E9.\n\nI was impressed, but would never go back. We hear lots these days about restaurants withering due to lack of interest, but what do you do when you\u2019re loved to the point that your walls can barely contain you? \u201cSo this is what stupid people look like,\u201d Becky Wharton wrote on My Neighbours The Dumplings\u2019 Instagram last April, revealing these new premises. \u201cTwo kids and two restaurants in three years!\u201d\n\nCut to a drab, very early Tuesday evening in early October, and we are eating alone in the all-new, bigger and, I think, better My Neighbours The Dumplings. We go at 5pm, managing to miss not only the hip things, but also the parents with toddlers who began to fill up the benches later. This suits me fine: the new residence is a gorgeous expanse of elegant calm. More beautiful, more, dare I say, grown-up than the first. It\u2019s twinkly, inviting and date-nightish. Or, in our case, date-late-afternoonish.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prawn har gow at My Neighbours the Dumplings: \u2018We quickly order a second basket.\u2019.\n\nOn one side, banqueting benches sit under explosions of greenery and a cacophony of lanterns and knick-knacks; on the other, a small dumpling kitchen. Trung Nguyen and master dumpling chef Carol Lee supervise the making of around 14,000 dumplings a week over the two sites. I think they may have nailed the perfect crisp, moist potsticker. You may know them as gyoza. I once heard potstickers called \u201cPeking ravioli\u201d in America. It\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re also nicknamed \u201cthe gateway dumpling\u201d by some, because, even if you\u2019re not in the mood for Asian food, they\u2019ll change your mind. Here, the vegetable potstickers are a punchy blend of shiitake, cabbage, chive and sesame.\n\nNext up, a thrilling basket of Cantonese crystal shrimp dumplings, or har gow, are the best I\u2019ve had in London. They are firm, satisfying bullets of joy, with stretchy, nigh-translucent skins, masking a buoyant whack of pink prawn, sesame and oyster sauce. We are supposed to be pacing ourselves, but quickly order another basket from the chipper staff.\n\nWe steer ourselves away from dumplings to the other small plates: a bowl of delightful pickled wood-ear mushrooms with goji berries and matchsticks of apple is fabulous and a great foil for a soothing, unusual cold plate of marinated silken tofu littered with preserved vegetables and pine nuts in a puddle of tamari.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Go on, it will be winter soon: the chocolate dumplings at My Neighbours The Dumplings, London E9.\n\nYakitori skewers of line-caught mackerel, grilled with lime and sake, are a delight. Possibly my least favourite dish is the fanciest and most expensive: a tartare of hamachi yellowtail on avocado mush looks charming on the menu photo, but makes little impact on my tastebuds.\n\nIf you go, which I think you should, order the chocolate dumplings. Yes, it\u2019s only a basket of unglamorous spring rolls filled with dark chocolate goo and served with a salted caramel dipping sauce and a scoop of ice-cream, but winter is coming and we all need extra fat to keep warm. Go early, beat the rush, order the har gow. That\u2019s how good neighbours become good friends.\n\n\u2022 My Neighbours The Dumplings 178-180 Victoria Park Road, London, E9, 020-3327 0447. Open all week, 5-10pm (11pm Fri & Sat). About \u00a320 a head plus drinks and service.\n\n\n\nFood 8/10\n\nAtmosphere 8/10\n\nService 8/10\n\n", "description": "The food at this new dumpling joint achieves the same scrumptious heights as at its sister restaurant \u2013 but get there early", "authors": ["Grace Dent"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeea382ef7f91b96d319821142652e8a43d13353/0_916_4499_2700/master/4499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2613ea3b66d3d48e9c1a12d93c51cfe8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
