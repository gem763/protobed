REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nOfficials and diplomats involved in negotiations over the acrimonious divorce between the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading bloc said that differences over the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.\n\nThe news lit a fire under European and U.S. equities, which jumped about 1% on Tuesday. The British pound GBP=D3 rocketed to $1.28, a level not seen since May 21. It gave back some of those gains on Wednesday to be last at $1.2759.\n\nThe pound has strengthened nearly 5% over the past week as investors rushed to reprice the prospect of a last-minute Brexit deal before the end-October deadline.\n\nThe positive sentiment extended on Wednesday with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS lifting 0.3%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 jumped 1.7% while Australian shares added 0.9% and South Korea's KOSPI index .KS11 climbed 0.7%.\n\nStronger-than-expected earnings from major U.S. banks JPMorgan (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) further boosted sentiment even as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.\n\n\u201cEquities rallied everywhere supported by another set of Brexit headlines and as earnings season started in the United States,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote in a client note.\n\n\u201cOfficials cautioned that talks haven\u2019t finished yet and there could yet be problems in hitting the deadline of midnight Tuesday,\u201d they added.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier had been demanding a legal text of any agreement by midnight U.K. time. However, the talks were still going on between UK Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU\u2019s executive European Commission past midnight in Brussels.\n\nThe EU will determine whether a deal is fit to be put to Thursday\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit for consideration.\n\n\u201cWatching the UK news channels last night, the arithmetic for achieving said approval is challenging to say the least,\u201d analysts at National Australia Bank wrote in a note.\n\nElsewhere, news on the U.S.-China trade front has been less encouraging.\n\nBloomberg reported, citing sources, that China will struggle to buy $50 billion of U.S. farm goods annually unless it removes retaliatory tariffs on American products, which would require reciprocal action by U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is also pretty apparent that President Xi Jinping is not going to put his signature to a Phase I deal next month unless or until the U.S. rescinds the threat of imposing additional tariffs on China on December 15,\u201d NAB analysts said.\n\nIn currencies, the Japanese yen JPY= was at the lowest in 2-1/2 months against the greenback as investors flocked to riskier assets. It was last at 109.82 per dollar.\n\nThe dollar itself was under pressure against a basket of six major currencies with its index .DXY hovering near three-week lows at 98.288. The euro EUR=D3 was flat at $1.1369.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude LCOc1 added 21 cents to $58.94 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 rose 20 cents to $53.01 after falling the previous session over fears the unrelenting U.S.-China trade war would keep squeezing the global economy.\n\nSpot gold was barely changed at $1,481.48 an ounce.
