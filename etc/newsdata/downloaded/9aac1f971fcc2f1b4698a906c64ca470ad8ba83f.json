El Ghazi pushed his head into Mings but escaped punishment, and Villa manager Dean Smith downplayed the incident after the game.\n\n\u201cIt was dealt with by the players in the dressing room and I\u2019m happy for that to happen, that\u2019s the spirit in the dressing room,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThings happen in team sport in the heat of the moment and it was sorted very quickly. At halftime they spoke about it, shook hands and we move on. What is disappointing is that we played just over 20 minutes against 10 men and couldn\u2019t take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nThe draw lifts West Ham into eighth place with eight points from five games, while Villa is 17th with four points.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ten-man West Ham held on for a 0-0 draw at Aston Villa in the Premier League on Monday after Arthur Masuaku was sent off midway through the second half.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/britain_soccer_premier_league_09611_c0-202-3132-2028_s1770x1032.jpg?690950a4331a504538ed80c8bf32a4c2d7276295", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
