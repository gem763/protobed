Despite still being in the red, the losses were substantially less in comparison to the previous quarter's operating losses of 313 billion won. LG said production efficiencies and cost improvements helped reduce losses.\n\nLG's TV business posted operating profit of 318 billion won, a slight decline from last year's 325 billion won, which was due to increased market competition and a weaker exchange rate, the company said. It added that OLED TVs were showing strong sales with a margin rate of 8.2%.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, the South Korean electronics expects intense competition for its home appliance business due to it being the \"offseason\", but said it would make efficient marketing efforts to maintain the same profit levels it achieved last year.\n\nLG added that it would continue to control costs for its mobile business as the company's transition to 5G has happened slower than expected in North America, but the company said it expects this to change next year.\n\nFor TVs, the company expects intense competition and slowing demand for TVs, meaning that it would increase its marketing spend for its TV business during the holiday season. Despite this, the company said it remained confident that its OLED TV and ultra-large sized TVs would continue to show growth, vowing for a stable profit structure at its results announcement.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nLG V50 ThinQ 4G review: A dual-display 5G flagship\n\nLG's V50 ThinQ 5G is a 5G smartphone with a difference: it comes with a hinged cover that incorporates a second screen.
