Printed skirts and tops nodded to nature, depicting trees and animals.\n\nWomen\u2019s silk shirts were long and loose, suits had box pleat or asymmetric skirts - short at the front and long at the back, while blazers were sculpted. Trousers were high waisted. There were also pinstripe suits.\n\nTisci put ruffled lace on the front and sleeves of dresses, which for the evening were adorned in crystal mesh or ostrich feathers. Footwear was split-toe block-heel boots and sandals.\n\nModel Gigi Hadid presents a creation during the Burberry catwalk show at London Fashion Week in London, Britain, September 16, 2019.

With that foundation in place, I feel ready to start exploring what\u2019s at the heart of this incredible brand,\u201d Tisci said in show notes.\n\n\u201cThis is the story behind this collection, a collection inspired by our past and dedicated to our future. It\u2019s the evolution of our Burberry kingdom.\u201d\n\nTisci used a simple colour palette of grey, black, white and beige, with dabs of red, blue, pink and yellow. There was also plenty of gingham.\n\nMenswear consisted of sharp suits and trench coats that were worn with belts. Tisci added details such as crystal embroidery, zips and rib-knit panels.\n\nTisci has enticed younger buyers with his casual designs and revamped \u201cTB\u201d logo and there were plenty of luxury tracksuits, T-shirts, snazzy jackets, sneakers, sandals and baseball caps - with long sides or diamant\u00e9 veils.\n\n\u201c...The Victorian era (was) a time in Britain for great change and progress, an era that has always inspired me and my work,\u201d Tisci said.\n\n\u201c(Burberry) chose to present his company with an emblem of a knight on a horse, but for his family crest, he instead chose a unicorn. Thomas Burberry was a daring innovator but also a romantic and a dreamer.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nIn an Instagram post ahead of the presentation, Burberry said the show had been certified as carbon neutral.\n\nWith younger clients\u2019 changing tastes and growing environmental awareness, many brands are seeking to improve their green credentials.\n\n\u201cWe have offset our impacts such as the flights of guests travelling to London specifically for the show and the build and production of the event through...projects which prevent deforestation and conserve tropical rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon,\u201d Burberry said.", "description": "Italian designer Riccardo Tisci looked to Burberry's Victorian roots for the luxury British brand's latest line at London Fashion Week on Monday, mixing delicate lace with edgy street style for looks aimed at catering to different age groups.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430574157&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1JW", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
