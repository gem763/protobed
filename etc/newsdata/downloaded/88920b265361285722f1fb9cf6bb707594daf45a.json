Her Majesty is seen at the State Opening of Parliament on October 14\n\nLabour leader in the Lords Baroness Smith of Basildon said: 'The bungling of Brexit has fractured our nation, it's divided friends, families and our politics.\n\n'If MPs were unable to reach a conclusion on the slightly revamped but inferior deal, I conceded that the way forward would have to be to ask the public to consider the issue.'\n\nShe added: 'It's (a general election) about the vision for the direction of this country, and the Conservative Party will have to stand on its record.'\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Lord Newby said it became clear to his party at the weekend that there was not a majority for a second referendum in the Commons 'and it was time to face that reality'.\n\nIndependent crossbencher and former lord chief justice Lord Judge argued the Fixed-term Parliaments Act was to blame for the stalemate in the Commons.\n\nHe said there should have been a general election after former prime minister Theresa May had her Brexit deal rejected.\n\nHe added: 'That is how our constitution is supposed to work. Instead of which we have been sitting, we sitting, they sitting, in paralysed impotence doing nothing except arguing whether we should argue again.'\n\nThe draft legislation looks set to complete its remaining stages this evening before heading for the statute book and so enable Parliament to be dissolved on November 6, paving the way for an election on December 12\n\nConservative peer and former chief whip Lord Taylor of Holbeach backed the Bill as 'a way of breaking the logjam'.\n\nHe said: 'If we do not have an election, this Parliament will continue to delay.'\n\nTory peer Lord Framlingham, the former deputy Commons speaker Michael Lord said: 'We must have a new House of Commons.\n\n'The nation is weary of it and it's become deeply damaging in so many ways we simply must start again.'\n\nThe former head of the British Army Lord Dannatt said: 'Like many members of this House and the British public at large, I have been utterly depressed by the inability of members of the Commons to provide the leadership, clarity of thought and good governance required to guide this country of ours through the turbulent times created by the outcome of the referendum in 2016.'", "description": "The one-page Bill, which has already been passed by the Commons, received an unopposed second reading by peers.
