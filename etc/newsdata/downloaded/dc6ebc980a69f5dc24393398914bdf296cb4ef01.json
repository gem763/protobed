During a post-match interview at Blizzard's \"Hearthstone\" tournament in Japan, he shouted: \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.\"\n\nIn a Twitter thread posted on Wednesday, Kern said that \"until Blizzard reverses their decision on Blitzchung, I am giving up playing Classic WoW.\"\n\nBlizzard \u2013 whose parent company Activision Blizzard is part-owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent \u2013 has drawn widespread criticism for its actions.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nProminent former Blizzard employee Mark Kern is boycotting his old employer after it banned pro esports player Blitzchung, real name Chung Ng Wai, for voicing support for the Hong Kong protestors.\n\nLast week, Blizzard \u2013 whose parent company is part-owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent \u2013 banned Blitzchung for a year and revoked $10,ooo in prize money he had won playing the Blizzard-made game 'Hearthstone.' The Hong Kong-based esports pro, whose real name is Chung Ng Wai, had shouted \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age\" in a live post-game interview.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kern \u2013 a team lead on \"World of Warcraft\" at Blizzard from 1997 to 2005 \u2013 posted a Twitter thread in response to Blitzchung's punishment. In the thread, he vowed to stop playing \"World of Warcraft\" and laid out his reasons for the boycott.\n\nThe thread's parent tweet reads: \"This hurts. But until Blizzard reverses their decision on @blitzchungHS I am giving up playing Classic WoW, which I helped make and helped convince Blizzard to relaunch. There will be no Mark of Kern guild after all. Let me explain why I am #BoycottBlizzard.\"\n\nRead more: Some Blizzard employees reportedly walked out to protest the punishment of a 'Hearthstone' competitor who spoke up in support of the Hong Kong protests\n\nIn the thread, Kern \u2013 who identifies as ethnically Chinese \u2013 strongly criticized the Chinese games industry. He claimed he had \"seen firsthand the corruption of Chinese gaming companies,\" and that he had once been \"removed from a company I founded (after Blizzard) for refusing to take a 2 million dollar kickback bribe to take an investment from China. Not everyone refused like I did.\"\n\nKern's criticisms also focused on China more broadly, as well as homing in on Blizzard. He accused China of \"dictating the world be authoritarian,\" calling on Blizzard to \"grow the spine it used to have\" and admitting \"Blizzard is the LAST company I ever expected to give in to China's demands.\"\n\nHis boycott comes at a time of intense and seemingly growing anti-Blizzard rhetoric in the wake of its Blitzchung ban.\n\nAs first reported by the Daily Beast, up to 30 employees from Blizzard's parent firm, Activision Blizzard, walked out in protest at the firm's actions. One longtime employee reportedly described Blizzard's actions as \"pretty appalling.\"\n\nBrian Kibler, a well-known 'Hearthstone' caster, has also said he will stop commentating on the Grandmasters circuit \u2013 the same tournament circuit that Blitzchung was banned from by Blizzard. On Wednesday, Kibler stated on his personal website that he \"will have no involvement in Grandmasters,\" unless \"something changes.\" He also described the punishment meted out by Blizzard to Blitzchung as \"incredibly harsh.\"\n\nThe incident has received attention outside gaming circles. On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden tweeted that Blizzard was prepared to \"humiliate itself\" to placate China, adding that \"no American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck.\"\n\nBlitzchung himself has defended his actions, describing it as his \"duty\" to comment on the Hong Kong protests.", "description": "In a tweet posted on Wednesday, Mark Kern said he'll stop playing 'World of Warcraft' - a game he helped make - and criticised China's games industry.", "authors": ["Charlie Wood"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9c9f47138e4a4bd64bcc38?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
