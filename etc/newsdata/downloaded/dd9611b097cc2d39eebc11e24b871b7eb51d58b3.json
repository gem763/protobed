You are driving home in your zippy electric car and need to recharge the batteries.\n\nTwo lamp posts on your street have chargers unobtrusively installed, making this vehicle the perfect purchase. No trips to the petrol station, no car tax, no eco-guilt.\n\nUnfortunately the parking spaces are taken by petrol cars.\n\nSo you head a few streets over to the nearest rapid charging station.\n\nLuckily it has an unoccupied reserved parking space. You plug in, pay up and can at last put your feet up for the evening \u2013 after walking home through the autumn rain. And you have to move the car later once it has charged up.\n\nThis does not sound fun, but you may have little choice about it in future...", "description": "Picture the scene.", "authors": ["Tim Wallace", "Matthew Lynn", "Ben Marlow"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/09/30/Changing-habits-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
