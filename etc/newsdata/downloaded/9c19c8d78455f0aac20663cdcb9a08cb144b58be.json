Sorry\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "The Swedish environmentalist was one of several who spoke at a Senate climate crisis task force\n\nAt a meeting of the Senate climate crisis task force on Tuesday, lawmakers praised a group of young activists for their leadership, their gumption and their display of wisdom far beyond their years. They then asked the teens for advice on how Congress might combat one of the most urgent and politically contentious threats confronting world leaders: climate change.\n\nGreta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who has galvanized young people across the world to strike for more action to combat the impact of global warming, politely reminded them that she was a student, not a scientist \u2013 or a senator.\n\n\u201cPlease save your praise. We don\u2019t want it,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn\u2019t lead to anything.\n\n\u201cIf you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don\u2019t want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.\u201d\n\nIn remarks meant for Congress as a whole, she said: \u201cI know you are trying but just not hard enough. Sorry.\u201d\n\nThe audience laughed. Supporters broke into applause. Senator Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and leads the Senate task force, was perhaps surprised by her bluntness. But he smiled.\n\nSeated at the table with the teens were some of the most sympathetic and vocal supporters of bold action on climate change in Congress. But facing a Republican-controlled Senate and a hostile White House, the prospect of enacting reforms at the scale and scope called for by activists \u2013 and many scientists \u2013 is bleak.\n\n\u201cWe need your leadership,\u201d he told Thunberg. \u201cYoung people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before. And that is creating a new X factor.\u201d\n\nStill, Markey vowed to try: \u201cWe hear you. We hear what you\u2019re saying and we will redouble our efforts.\u201d\n\nThunberg was one of several youth activists invited to address the task force during two days of action and speeches aimed at urging lawmakers to support \u201ctransformative climate action\u201d. She was joined by activists from across the US and South America, part of a \u201cmultiracial, intergenerational\u201d effort to combat climate change.\n\nThe meetings and speeches in Washington are intended to raise awareness ahead of a global climate strike on Friday in which students and workers will walk out of schools and offices to pressure their governments to act as world leaders gather in New York for the annual United Nations summit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nadia Nazar, co founder of Zero Hour, speaks to the media on 17 September in Washington DC.

We will be known as the solution to the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nIn the US, support for sweeping action on climate change is polarized. Many Republicans \u2013 among them Donald Trump \u2013 are still openly skeptical of the science behind global warming. Republican leaders have mocked Democrats for introducing a Green New Deal and have used the proposal as a cudgel against lawmakers and presidential candidates.\n\nThe Green New Deal is an ambitious 14-page resolution that calls for a \u201c10-year national mobilization\u201d that would eliminate the nation\u2019s emissions in one decade. Scientists say limiting warming to 1.5C would require cutting manmade carbon levels by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero around 2050.\n\nMarkey said their movement is shifting the political landscape. The senator pointed to the 2020 presidential debates as evidence of what has changed. Candidates are being asked about climate change and pushed to introduce plans to combat global warming. This is in stark contrast to 2016.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened? You have happened,\u201d he told the activists. \u201cYou are giving this extra level of energy to the political process that is absolutely changing the dynamics of politics in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 election, Markey said, will in many ways be a \u201creferendum on climate change\u201d.\n\nThunberg arrived in the US after crossing the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht. She rose to international prominence after launching \u201cFridays for Future\u201d: student-led strikes that have spread to 135 countries. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nOn Monday, she met Barack Obama. The former president shared a photo from their meeting, in which he praised Thunberg as \u201cone of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates\u201d and someone who is \u201cunafraid to push for real action\u201d.\n\nBarack Obama (@BarackObama) Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. pic.twitter.com/VgCPAaDp3C\n\nLater on Tuesday, the group was scheduled to meet Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal in the House.\n\nOn Wednesday, Thunberg will deliver what has been billed as a \u201cmajor address\u201d to members of Congress.", "description": "The Swedish environmentalist was one of several who spoke at a Senate climate crisis task force", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28e4ae50c03cbea4417dc652d81146c5d4fcee7/0_0_4162_2498/master/4162.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bd1efd0f54d63d3b7925824aa06b9ebe", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
