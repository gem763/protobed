I don\u2019t have problems with any site but Gmail, and it\u2019s been happening for months. I\u2019ve googled it several times and never found any good information.\u201d\n\nWorry not, Melissa. I have a few ideas. The rest of this column is going to take us on a little trip down troubleshooting lane. I don\u2019t have any specific advice for why Gmail\u2014and only Gmail\u2014isn\u2019t really working for you. However, there are a few tricks I use in situations like these to get to the bottom of the problem.\n\nTry a new browser\n\nYou didn\u2019t mention what browser you\u2019re using. (I could ask, but I\u2019m going to treat your Slack messages like a regular reader question in the Tech 911 mailbag.) So, my first troubleshooting step would be to load up a different browser, like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, or even that Chromium-based Edge that\u2019s been fun to use lately. If a backup browser gives you perfect access to Gmail, great! We\u2019re narrowing it down.\n\nCheck for problematic \u201chelpful\u201d apps\n\nIf you still can\u2019t access Gmail no matter what browser you try, something at the system level might be to blame. This could be something screwy with your operating system (your hosts file, perhaps), or perhaps some app you\u2019ve installed that\u2019s restricting your access for a reason. You\u2019ll probably know if you\u2019ve recently installed any kind of new antivirus or anti-malware tool that might be acting up. If so, consider checking the settings on that one to see if you can whitelist Gmail; at minimum, try disabling it (temporarily!) to see if that fixes your issue at all. If not, your issue probably isn\u2019t the app\u2019s fault.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t installed anything like that recently, you should still run through your computer\u2019s applications to see if there are any similar apps running that you might not know about. Same deal; see what you can whitelist, and consider briefly disabling the apps to see if your issue resolves. If it does, consider looking for a new antivirus or anti-malware app if you have no idea how to get Gmail working with what you\u2019re currently using.\n\nReset all the things\n\nOther steps I\u2019d try include resetting your cable or DSL modem, as well as your router (if separate). While I doubt something has changed in your router\u2019s settings to make Gmail, of all things, not load anymore, it\u2019s worth considering. Make sure your router is updated to the latest firmware version and, if that doesn\u2019t fix anything, consider starting from scratch\u2014reset the device to factory defaults and set up your wifi again. It shouldn\u2019t take very long to do, and this will ensure that some random option wasn\u2019t accidentally set somehow to mess up Gmail. (I doubt this is the case, but troubleshooting is troubleshooting.)\n\nStop using your ISP\u2019s DNS\n\nYou might also want to consider switching your DNS to something else, as I\u2019m assuming you aren\u2019t already using a third-party service like Google DNS or 1.1.1.1. Once you\u2019ve set that up on your computer, be sure to clear your DNS cache by typing \u201cipconfig -flushdns\u201d into a Windows Command Prompt or one of the many commands for whatever version of macOS you\u2019re using.\n\n(You can also configure your router to use one of these DNS services. It\u2019s a slightly more intricate process, but one that will force everything connected to it to use the better DNS.)\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nWhat if your browser is to blame?\n\nLet\u2019s head back to the beginning. If your backup browser loads a website that your normal browser cannot, make sure you\u2019re running the most up-to-date version of the latter (which you can typically check by visiting its \u201cAbout\u201d page, usually buried under its Help menu). However, I bet that some extension of yours is messing everything up.\n\nOdds are good it\u2019s some kind of privacy-themed extension. Go through everything you use, and you should know what they are, to see if you can whitelist Gmail in any way. (I often find that uBlock Origin, great as it is, can mess up the experience on some sites I frequent.) If you\u2019re at a loss, you can also go into your browser\u2019s extension manager and disable everything. See if that gets Gmail to load. If so, slowly start enabling extensions one-by-one, loading Gmail between each, to see which is responsible.\n\nYou can also try clearing your browser\u2019s cache and cookies to see if that fixes the problem. There might also be some kind of general issue with Gmail and cookies, so go into your browser\u2019s settings (like this) and make sure that you aren\u2019t accidentally blocking cookies for mail.google.com (or anything else Google-y). To be safe, whitelist mail.google.com and www.google.com, and see if that fixes the issue.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIf this is all a bit tricky to figure out, you can simply reset your browser to its default settings, which should also fix anything you\u2019ve accidentally done to prevent Gmail from loading. If you\u2019re on Firefox, consider refreshing the browser, too\u2014maybe you\u2019re having a problem with your specific profile.\n\nMaybe everyone else is having an issue, too\n\nThough this isn\u2019t going to help out your particular situation, I bet, I\u2019d also recommend bookmarking Down For Everyone Or Just Me, which is a great tool you can use to confirm whether a website is actually down, or, well, the problem is all on your shoulders.\n\nIf all else fails...\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend it as a long-term solution, but HTML Gmail might also at least give you access to your inbox while you solve the problem. Of course, you could also integrate your Gmail with a third-party app; what you lose in Google\u2019s UI, you\u2019ll gain in... being able to send messages.\n\nI think that\u2019s it for my list, though. Hopefully one of these many solutions will let you back into Gmail. If not, let me know! And if you\u2019re reading this column and you have a great idea of something I left out, let me know in the comments!
