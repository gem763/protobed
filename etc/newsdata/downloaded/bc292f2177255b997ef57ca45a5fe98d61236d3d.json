The event was spawned by the viral Facebook event \"Storm Area 51,\" and while you can Naruto-run there, you sure can't fly there now.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration announced two \"temporary flight restrictions for special security reasons,\" effectively banning air traffic ahead of the festival from early Wednesday to late Sunday, CNET reports. The airspace will be closed to news helicopters, drones, private pilots, and any other aircrafts above Rachel, Nevada, U.S. Air Force's Nevada Test and Training Range, and Area 51 itself.\n\nSEE ALSO: People are already getting arrested at Area 51, and of course they're YouTubers\n\nWhile the original meme event \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All Of Us\" was meant in jest, it garnered 2 million RSVPs worldwide and a pretty sick music video for one of Lil Nas X's many \"Old Town Road\" remixes.\n\nEventually the Air Force had to step in to squash the tin foil hat dreams. Amidst reports that even the neighboring town couldn't hold the influx of tourists, a music festival was planned to either deter or distract alien-lovers from actually trespassing on government property.\n\nBut Matty Roberts, the original poster of the page, has since severed his ties with Alienstock, calling it \u201ca possible humanitarian disaster\u201d and \"FYREFEST 2.0.\u201d He cited the \"lack of infrastructure, poor planning, risk management and blatant disregard for the safety of the expected 10,000+ AlienStock attendees.\"\n\nDue to this risk, the original organizers moved away from the festival in Rachel and now encourages planned attendees to head to an alternative free Area 51 Celebration in the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center. News outlets reported that Alienstock was dead. But, as you can probably guess by now, that's not stopping some folks from \"seeing them aliens.\"\n\nVarious organizers are claiming the festival in Rachel is still going ahead, with 2,600 camping spots booked. Additionally, YouTubers are already getting arrested for jumping the fence into the Area 51 base.\n\nSo even if thousands of people do end up attending the event from the sheer force of meme power alone, the heavens above will be clear of any aircrafts, both unidentified and otherwise.", "description": "Federal agencies are prepping for the alien-themed music festival Alienstock in the Nevada desert near the U.S. Air Force Base Area 51 this weekend.
