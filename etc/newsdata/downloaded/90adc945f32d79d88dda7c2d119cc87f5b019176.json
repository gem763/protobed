Over-the-counter trading will be allowed.\n\nThe advent of the green bonds will help protect Kenya from the impact of extreme weather on the agriculture sector, which contributes about a third of annual GDP, said Nuru Mugambi, a director at the Kenya Bankers Association.\n\n\u201cWith the landmark legislation that zero-rates taxes on green bonds, we expect to see more issuance coming to market,\u201d she said.\n\nIn January, HSBC said global green bond issuance is seen at $140-$180 billion this year, from $149.2 billion in 2018.", "description": "Kenya's first green bond has raised 4.3 billion shillings ($41.45 million) to build environmentally-friendly student accommodation, the issue's lead arranger said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Duncan Miriri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436610666&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920SW"}
