My boyfriend and I have been dating for six years.\n\nHe has no children, has a well-paid job and takes very good care of us.\n\nHe recently told me he has another girlfriend whom he met before me and that he has no intention of leaving her.\n\nHe says she can\u2019t have children and he wants to marry us both.\n\nI\u2019ve told him I\u2019m not getting pregnant again without being married but I\u2019m not interested in polygamy.\n\nI think he\u2019s using me for my ability to have children and I feel my time has been wasted.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to break up with him three times but always find myself back in his arms. We\u2019ve agreed to try couple\u2019s therapy but I\u2019m in Durban and he\u2019s in Ulundi.\n\nIf this is not sorted out soon I need to leave.\n\nI want to get married and have more kids but I don\u2019t want to share my husband.\n\nRead more: We speak to the wives of a polygamist who say their domestic setup is blissful\n\nAnswer\n\nIt\u2019s decision time. You seem to know exactly what you want and what\u2019s necessary to make it happen.\n\nAll you need to do is make the decision and move on, wherever the road takes you. Your man wants to have his cake and eat it.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t he tell you about this other woman when your relationship started?\n\nWhy wait for six years to tell you something so vital to the well-being of your relationship?\n\nGoing for therapy is a good idea because it will help you focus on the goal for your relationship and help you make the right decision.\n\nThe distance issue is a real challenge and just might be the deal breaker.\n\nAccording to Psychology Today If you are unhappy in your relationship and considering polyamory as a \u201cone-foot-out-the-door\u201d strategy, please reconsider.\n\nNot only is your original relationship unlikely to survive the rigors of honest communication and complex feelings, but your will most likely hurt the other people you date in your polyamorous experimentation.\n\nIf you know things are really over, then break up with your former relationship completely and take a moment to catch your breath before plunging into a poly relationship. It will save everyone involved excruciating pain.", "description": "Sis Dolly answers some of the burning questions from our readers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9492/52649df7ea41451abdbc7046c27da528.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
