Photo: Courtesy of STXfilms\n\nMarianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant), the protagonist of Portrait of a Lady on Fire, is stealing peeks at H\u00e9lo\u00efse (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) while walking behind her, studying the blonde hair revealed when her hood falls around her shoulders, daring sidelong glances at her silhouette as they stand side by side facing the sea. The love affair in C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s film is one that unfolds in looks like these, which grow longer and more intense as the two women grow closer. But at first, Marianne can only see the woman she\u2019s been hired to secretly paint in pieces, sketching remembered fragments of H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s face back in her room. There\u2019s a terrible irony to this task; the portrait is intended for a Milanese man who\u2019ll use it to assess whether the woman it depicts will make for an acceptable bride. Portrait of a Lady on Fire is all about women\u2019s art and relationships in a world defined by men, and the entire time I was watching it, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Hustlers.\n\nThe concept of the male gaze isn\u2019t a tough one to grok, whether you\u2019ve read film theorist Laura Mulvey\u2019s famous 1975 essay about it or not. It\u2019s widespread, the default, the point of view of implicit power and heterosexual lust. It\u2019s an offscreen Italian guy who\u2019s going to glance at a piece of art and decide if he wants to fuck its subject. But to watch Sciamma\u2019s period drama and Lorene Scafaria\u2019s stripper saga \u2014 films separated by a few centuries, a few thousand miles, and at least a few dozen yards of costuming fabric \u2014 is to be reminded that no one, including women who shoot films, is in full agreement as to what the female gaze looks like. Both movies are about women who make a living catering to male desire but who are only truly seen by one another. Both evoke that truth with camerawork that echoes the perspectives of its main characters. In Portrait of a Lady on Fire, that gaze, and the relationship that grows out of it, are able to flourish because the characters are temporarily together on a remote estate where only women seem to be around. Hustlers, which also has the advantage of 21st-century liberties, takes place right in the middle of a business designed to cater to men who want to watch.\n\nAd\u00e8le Haenel and No\u00e9mie Merlant in Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

In some ways, it made me appreciate the liberation of Scafaria\u2019s film even more \u2014 how aware it is of the eyes of the men who fill the club, wait in the Champagne Room, and become eventual targets for the scam, and how little obligation it feels to drop us into their perspective. That indifference is apparent from one of its earliest and greatest sequences, in which Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Ramona walks into the movie and onto the stage to pole-dance to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal.\u201d The number is shot slightly from below, looking up at an angle that makes Lopez loom tall in the frame. It replicates the perspective not of the appreciative patrons clustered by the stage but of Destiny (Constance Wu), who\u2019s standing awestruck out on the floor. The film cuts between Ramona\u2019s performance and Destiny\u2019s face as she watches, and never closes in on any one part of Lopez\u2019s body. The intention is not to evoke the lust of the money-hurling mass of customers but to show us Ramona the way Destiny sees her, as this powerful, enviable whole.\n\nLater, when Destiny finds Ramona out on the club\u2019s rooftop, smoking a cigarette while sprawled out in her fur coat, it\u2019s a tableau that\u2019s both glorious and solitary, the skyline behind her and the city seemingly at her feet. When Ramona glides through the club, it\u2019s inevitably in slow motion and sometimes with other characters in formation around her like a conquering army. It\u2019s an effect that anoints her, and eventually Destiny, with a sense of ownership. The movie shoots the club as a women\u2019s workplace, cinematographer Todd Banhazl\u2019s camera tracking Destiny as she works the floor or darting around to catch the other characters on the job. The dressing room is a whole other space, physically and mentally. It\u2019s cluttered and bright, and the way it\u2019s shot \u2014 the camera crowds companionably in at eye level as though it\u2019s just one of the girls, utterly matter-of-fact about any skin on display \u2014 has more in common with the look of Ramona\u2019s airy Upper East Side apartment than the inside of the club.\n\nThe closest the film comes to giving us a customer\u2019s perspective is when it shows us Destiny and Ramona in a striptease double act in the club\u2019s backroom, and even then, the angles are reminiscent of the ways the characters study themselves in a mirror, strategically assessing their own allure. When Destiny is demeaned by a customer trying to coax his way into a blowjob, the camera gets low with her on the ground, emphasizing her feelings of powerlessness and not the perspective of the man looking down at her. And when a client gets handsy with Ramona, the camera holds on her face as she strides away \u2014 a contrast with her closeness with Destiny, whom she tucks into her fur coat, whose hands she clasps at the diner, and whose head she cradles in her lap at her grandmother\u2019s funeral. Warmth comes easily to Ramona, but dependability is another matter, and the way she\u2019s framed reveals itself to be a reflection of Destiny\u2019s fears of abandonment. Ramona stands on stages and lounges on rooftops and lives up in apartment towers, near but always threatening to rise out of reach.\n\nJennifer Lopez in Hustlers.

An initial montage of targets at one point finds the women piling into one side of an SUV with a stoned patsy and emerging directly out the other door at the club with another. It\u2019s only when one of their victims come sharply and unignorably into focus that they run into trouble, and the movie stops allowing its primary characters to pretend they\u2019re just getting their own in a rigged system and not also causing harm to individuals. Even then, it\u2019s not what will bring about their inevitable downfall that\u2019s the question \u2014 it\u2019s whether the friendship at the heart of the film is real.\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire hasn\u2019t reached U.S. theaters yet. When it does arrive in December, it\u2019ll be with the kind of fanfare that tends to accompany a film that was acclaimed when it premiered at Cannes (where it won the Queer Palm as well as the award for screenplay) and that\u2019s since had pride of place at a slew of other festivals around the world. It\u2019ll be taken seriously, whereas Hustlers, which had an abrupt if glittery premiere at Toronto a few days before it reached theaters, has tended to be treated as a romp, a possible Oscar vehicle for Lopez, and not much more. But just because it plays as light doesn\u2019t preclude its having depth, and its own provocative take on the female gaze as something that doesn\u2019t need to be underscored by the absence of men to exist. Hustlers makes it look so deceptively easy, like it\u2019s ridiculous that we haven\u2019t had all along a frictionless shift of perspective and narrative agency to characters who\u2019ve traditionally been regarded as things to be gazed at.\n\nThe greatest trick Hustlers pulls off is the way it\u2019s able to convey that Ramona is a platonic source of desire for Destiny \u2014 she\u2019s a friend and a maternal surrogate, but also a figure who can\u2019t entirely be understood or trusted. Ramona is allowed to be a little distant, to be a receptacle of doubt and longing, to be seen subjectively without being reduced to an accessory who only exists in another character\u2019s head. Unlike Marianne, Destiny\u2019s able to look straight on at the object of her affection from the start \u2014 though that doesn\u2019t translate to her feeling like she\u2019s knows her. When the camera tracks Ramona\u2019s Juicy Coutured figure down the sidewalk as \u201cRoyals\u201d plays and the criminal enterprise reaches its inevitable end point, it still looks as though it\u2019s trying to catch up with her. Of course, the ones who actually accomplish that are the cops.", "description": "Lorene Scafaria\u2019s stripper scam saga Hustlers may be set in an industry that caters to the desires of men, but when it comes to how it looks, and how lead actresses Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu are portrayed, its gaze is entirely female.", "authors": ["Alison Willmore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/03-hustlers-female-gaze-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
