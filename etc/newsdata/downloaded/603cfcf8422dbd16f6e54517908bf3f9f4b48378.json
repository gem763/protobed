In the previous session, prices fell 1.8%, their\n\nbiggest one-day percentage decline since Sept. 5.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 were up 0.2% at $1,515.70 per\n\nounce.\n\nGold has pulled back, given that there is some ambiguity as\n\nto how considerable the potential for impeachment is for the\n\nU.S. president and also his comments on trade with China has\n\ncalmed market sentiments, said IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda.\n\nGold has since bounced off from uncomfortable levels and is\n\nstuck in a range trading, Rodda added.\n\nThe dollar index posted its sharpest daily gain in\n\nthree months overnight and held steady in Asian trade, while\n\nstocks rose as investors welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's\n\nhints of progress toward a trade deal with China. USD/\n\nTrump said a deal to end a nearly 15-month trade war with\n\nChina \"could happen sooner\" than people think, which could ease\n\nthe pall of gloom over the global economic outlook. Political worries also eased as investors largely shrugged\n\noff the Democrats' decision to begin an impeachment inquiry into\n\nTrump. That came even as a summary of a telephone call showed\n\nthe U.S. president asked Ukraine's president to investigate a\n\npolitical rival. \"Gold's price from a fundamental perspective is still\n\nsupported,\" Rodda said, citing \"there is still evidence that\n\nglobal economy is slowing down and policymakers will potentially\n\npartake in new quantitative easing programmes that is going to\n\ndrive rates and yields down.\"\n\nLower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding\n\nnon-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar, making gold\n\ncheaper for investors holding other currencies.\n\nIndicative of investor sentiment, holdings at SPDR Gold\n\nTrust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded\n\nfund, rose 1.81% to 924.94 tonnes on Wednesday. Spot gold is likely to fall to $1,488 per ounce, as it has\n\nbroken a support at $1,514, according to Reuters technical\n\nanalyst Wang Tao.
