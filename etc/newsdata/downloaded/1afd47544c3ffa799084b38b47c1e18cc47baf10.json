It\u2019s the last place anyone would expect to see the arch enemy of fast food.\n\n\u201cI never thought I'd be in a kitchen making, like, my own fried chicken sandwiches \u2014 crispy chicken sandwich[es],\u201d he told \u201cNightline.\u201d\n\nThe project appears to be a complete reversal for the documentary filmmaker, who 15 years ago talked about making himself sick eating only McDonald's food for an entire month, as chronicled in the Oscar-nominated film \u201cSuper Size Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn't a journey that I thought I'd be on,\u201d Spurlock said.\n\nOn the subject of his pop-up restaurant, Spurlock said he believes critics will be skeptical \"until the minute you walk in the door and then you're like, \u2018Oh this is something very different.\u2019 You know the fact that it is a place that tells you the truth from the minute you walk in.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant, which has been years in the making, is the culmination of Spurlock's latest documentary, \u201cSuper Size Me 2: Holy Chicken.\u201d\n\nJeff Vespa/Samuel Goldwyn Films\n\nSpurlock made it clear his goal was not to put \u201cbig chicken out of business.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never gonna put big chicken out of business just like you never can put McDonald's out of business,\u201d Spurlock said. \u201cBut I think the goal of Holy Chicken is how do you start to at least level the playing field? \u2026 I think what we can do is start to at least put a message out there, that there is a better way, that there's a different way\u2026 The way we\u2019ll beat them is\u2026 creat[ing] a truly farm-to-table, local fast food restaurant.\u201d\n\nWatch the full story on \"Nightline\" TONIGHT at 12:35 a.m. ET on ABC\n\nAfter all, when it comes to fast food, chicken is the latest rage. Spurlock\u2019s sandwich is coming on the heels of one of the biggest feuds this summer: Popeye\u2019s new chicken sandwich versus Chick-fil-A\u2019s classic chicken sandwich.\n\n\u201cYou see our sandwich, we stand much higher above them, and there is no competition,\u201d Spurlock said of both restaurants.\n\nAt Spurlock\u2019s restaurant, truth is on the menu. From the packaging to the walls, everything is decorated in trade secrets \u2014 information that provides full disclosures on how fast food companies convince you that a junk food meal is somehow healthy.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cThe health halo is a term that the industry uses to kind of describe the way they shroud your food and things that make you think it's better for you than it actually is\u2026 [Sometimes] that's just the way things are colored,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, green makes you think of natural, fresh vegetables, to the words that we use \u2014 crispy being a perfect example. Fried is kind of gone from the fast food vernacular; everything is crispy because it doesn't sound bad for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give you what you need and what you want is a delicious grilled crispy chicken sandwich,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what you need is an education.\u201d\n\nTransparency, Spurlock said, is at the heart of his passion project. It\u2019s a full career reboot after he decided to be transparent about his history of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn 2017, the director published a statement on social media titled \u201cI am part of the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I looked at some of my past actions as being problematic\u2026[they] shouldn't have happened. Should have been done differently,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody came forward to pressure me. Nobody came forward and said I'm coming after you. And this was in the middle of the kind of #MeToo explosion, where I just started kind of taking stock in my life.\u201d\n\nIn his post, Spurlock detailed a list of examples, writing, \u201cI have been unfaithful to every wife and girlfriend I have ever had.\u201d\n\nHe also described a sexual encounter which led to an allegation of date rape when he was in college. No charges were ever filed.\n\nYears later, he settled a sexual harassment claim at his production company.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing physical to it,\u201d he said of the settlement. \u201cI would say things to someone that was my assistant that were, you know, sexually offensive. You know, I called her sex pants. Hot pants\u2026 Again there was nothing physical to it, but it...verbally crossed the line\u2026 it was demeaning.\u201d\n\nSpurlock said it has been a long journey of making amends.\n\n\u201cI had to start with myself. How do I start to make myself better? And, you know, I got sober 640-plus days ago and it's been the greatest thing. I wish I'd done it 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I'm at the point of my journey where I'm reaching out to the people and starting to make amends. Where you know I'm contacting them, I'm sitting down with them, I'm talking to them.\u201d\n\nSpurlock also opened up about sexual abuse during his childhood in the post.\n\n\"In the state of mind I was in...I dealt with depression for decades,\" he said. \"Something I also had never talked about. And it was in one of those moments where I had to. It was it was almost like a soul purge that happened.\"\n\n\u201cThe minute I hit send, I felt better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's also one of those moments as a manic depressive, you don't think about the results of your actions in those moments. And it was an incredibly selfless action that I took to do that because the ripple effect of what happened affected so many people.\u201d\n\nComing clean personally imploded Spurlock's life professionally and hurt the people closest to him.\n\n\u201cWe had sold the sequel to the film out of the Toronto Film Festival to YouTube for $3.5 million,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was going to come out in theaters in April 2018 but then once I said what I said, everything just collapsed. Everybody walked away. Every TV show, every movie project, everything that we were working on... [The] film went back on a shelf.\u201d\n\nSpurlock said his team \u201cnever got\u201d the $3.5 million. He eventually also lost his production company, Warrior Poets.\n\n\u201cThe people that I hurt\u2026I worked with. I mean, these are people that I put out of work a week before Christmas who had kids, who had families, who suddenly were like, \u2018What happened?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt's one of the things I'm continuing to try and move forward as best you can.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Spurlock is looking for professional redemption.\n\n\u201cThis movie was shelved for two years,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked for a year and a half to try and find a distributor. Company ended up having to file for bankruptcy. The movie could still be sitting on a shelf and the farmers deserve this more than anyone. And that's the thing that I've been fighting for the last 18 months: Jonathan and Zach, who literally put their life and work on the line to tell their story and be a part of this.\u201d\n\nJonathan and Zach Buttram, a father and son farming duo, serve as Spurlock\u2019s window into the chicken industry in the documentary.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about numbers for the industry,\" Jonathan Buttram said. \"Getting the most amount of chickens grown out in the least amount of space for the least amount of money so they can make the most amount of money.\u201d\n\nHe said most chickens are being bred in cramped conditions.\n\n\u201cThey're eating their own feces and these chickens have to have a place to sit down and rest. When they sit down there [and it's] wet and there's methane and ammonia coming up and it burns their breast, burns their paws and they have a hard time getting the food and water,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think that with Morgan and to get this word out...we want to try to give people a healthy alternative.\u201d\n\nThe Buttrams say their Alabama family farm has been punished for years in retaliation for working with Spurlock and for sharing what they say are the chicken industry\u2019s dirty secrets.\n\n\u201cI've been blackballed for speaking out,\u201d Jonathan Buttram added. \u201cMy son's been blackballed and my wife, they stopped placement of her contract. Her placement of her chickens when I spoke out in Ohio.\u201d\n\nHe says it\u2019s \u201chumbling\u201d to see the information exposed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m being able to get the word out and let people know what\u2019s happening to the farmers and the animals -- the chickens out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe farmers are not being treated well at all and the animals are being treated horribly in those large factory farms.\u201d\n\nJeff Vespa/Samuel Goldwyn Films\n\nSpurlock said there\u2019s a dark side to \u201cbig chicken,\u201d referring to the nation\u2019s top chicken producers. He said that when these larger companies partner with chicken farmers, they tend to squeeze their livelihoods.\n\n\u201cI take calls, as matter of fact, two calls in the last couple of weeks of farmers, [saying] \u2018I'm at the end of my rope.\u2019 That means suicide. And so I have to start counseling then sometimes drive to their farm,\u201d Spurlock said. \u201cBecause when [big chicken companies] come and they say, 'Well I'm gonna terminate your contract if you don't do this, this and this and you're gonna lose your farm.'\u201d\n\nThe National Chicken Council, which represents the U.S.'s largest chicken production companies, told ABC that Spurlock\u2019s project is \u201cclearly told in a story intended for \u2018entertainment\u2019 and not based on facts.\u201d It called the film \u201can unfortunate and one-sided hit piece on an industry that provides Americans with the healthiest, most sustainable, affordable, and responsibly raised protein in the market.\" The full statement from the National Chicken Council can be found at the end of this story.\n\nJeff Vespa/Samuel Goldwyn Films\n\nThe council also said 95% of farmers that it works with choose to renew their contracts year after year.\n\n\u201cHoly Chicken,\u201d both the film and the franchise, aim to debunk the chicken industry\u2019s corporate mythology, breaking down what Spurlock says are misleading phrases like \u201cnatural,\u201d \u201cartisan\u201d and \u201cfree range.\u201d\n\nSpurlock said \u201cthere are places that\u201d do actually raise chickens in the free-range environment people imagine: \u201cThere are places where the chickens do actually get to go outside, but they're so few and far between of what is truly representative of the industry it's crazy.\u201d\n\nSpurlock said this reveal will help shatter illusions, making us savvier costumers, which is why transparency is the ultimate goal. For Spurlock, the truth telling he\u2019s done all these years in front of the camera is now matched behind it.\n\n\u201cI'm excited to see who this filmmaker is now that [he's come] out of this process versus the one that was there before,\u201d he said.\n\nFull statement from the National Chicken Council:\n\nThe National Chicken Council is aware of the film \u201cSuper Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!\u201d from filmmaker and activist Morgan Spurlock. His latest stunt is an unfortunate and one-sided hit piece on an industry that provides Americans with the healthiest, most sustainable, affordable, and responsibly raised protein in the market. It is clearly told in a story intended for \u201centertainment\u201d and not based on facts.\n\nWhile NCC did not participate in the film\u2019s production, we can say that we\u2019re proud of how U.S. chicken is produced.\n\nSince the movie\u2019s original filming more than three years ago, a lot has changed:\n\nThe chicken industry launched its transparency campaign \u2013 Chicken Check In\u2013 to answer questions about chicken production;\n\n- NCC\u2019s animal welfare guidelines were updated and certified by an independent audit certification organization;\n\n- All quick service restaurants now post calories on their menus; and\n\n- The majority of chicken farmers today are thriving and helping to produce America\u2019s #1 protein.\n\nWe invite anyone interested in seeing first-hand the real story of broiler chickens to watch NCC\u2019s360\u00b0 video series. These videos show chickens\u2019 journey, from their first day in a hatchery to how they\u2019re cared for on the farm. Our members use industry leading and third-party certified animal welfare practices to ensure the birds are raised as healthy as possible. The national flock is as healthy as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nWe are also proud to share that the overwhelming majority of the 25,000 farm families who partner with chicken companies are satisfied with their relationship. In fact, almost 95% of all contract farmers choose to renew year-over-year by the same company, and most companies have waiting lists of farmers wanting to enter a partnership. The ultimate success of the chicken company depends on the farmer.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/morgan-spurlock-soda-abc-ay-190918_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
