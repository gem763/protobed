And in their study titled Who Falls Prey to the Wolf of Wall Street?' Leuz et. al. found that it is 'quite common' for investors to lose money by buying into 'pump and dump' schemes.\n\nIn contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE:APLE), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple Hospitality REIT\n\nApple Hospitality REIT's Earnings Per Share Are Growing.\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS). That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Apple Hospitality REIT managed to grow EPS by 8.5% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.\n\nI like to take a look at earnings before interest and (EBIT) tax margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. I note that Apple Hospitality REIT's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort my analysis of its margins. Apple Hospitality REIT reported flat revenue and EBIT margins over the last year. That's not bad, but it doesn't point to ongoing future growth, either.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below.

This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.\n\nThe good news is that Apple Hospitality REIT insiders spent a whopping US$1.2m on stock in just one year, and I didn't see any selling. As if for a flower bud approaching bloom, I become an expectant observer, anticipating with hope, that something splendid is coming. We also note that it was the Independent Director, Daryl Nickel, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$395k for shares at about US$16.44 each.\n\nAlong with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Apple Hospitality REIT is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$236m. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Some have more dollars than sense, they say, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vhmhdf4dh2GlP2xXE84A9w--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/950554d15207e8aaefb2523d27c64bf7", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
