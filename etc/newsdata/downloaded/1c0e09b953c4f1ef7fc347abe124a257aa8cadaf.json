Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. - If Sedley Alley was unfairly denied DNA testing from a 1985 crime scene and then executed, he'd be the only person in the state of Tennessee to suffer such a fate, argued Barry Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project, in court Monday.\n\n\u201cOnly he,\u201d Scheck said. \u201cHe is in a class of one.\u201d\n\nAlley was executed in 2006 for the rape and murder of Suzanne Collins, 19, whose body was found outside the Millington naval base where she was stationed.\n\nCriminal Court Judge Paula Skahan heard arguments from attorneys for The Innocence Project, a nonprofit that advocates for DNA testing and criminal justice reform, and the state in a hearing Monday.\n\nApril Alley, Sedley Alley's daughter, filed the petition to have DNA from the crime scene tested in her role as executor of her father's estate. She is represented by attorneys from the Innocence Project.\n\nSkahan is expected to rule on the petition for post-conviction relief on Nov. 18.\n\nTennessee executions since 2000: Sedley Alley; Date of Execution: June 28, 2006 (For Murder) (Photo: File Photo)\n\nThe body of Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Collins was found early morning in 1985 in Edmund Orgill Park. An autopsy showed she had been struck at least 100 times and strangled. She had been sexually assaulted and impaled with a tree branch.\n\nAlley initially denied any involvement, but later signed a statement admitting to killing Collins. Details of his statement contradicted the crime scene and autopsy, and a witness' description of a suspect didn't match Alley's physical appearance.\n\nLater, Alley would say he did not remember the crime and that he had been coerced into confessing.\n\nHe never stopped claiming innocence: Texas executes man in 1998 slaying of college student.\n\n\u201cThis has all the earmarks of a false confession,\u201d Scheck said. \u201cBut we need not debate it, because DNA evidence can provide us an answer.\u201d\n\nAlley was executed by lethal injection on June 28, 2006, with his daughter present at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville.\n\nMarine Corps Lance Corporal Suzanne Collins, 19, was murdered in 1985 in Millington. (Photo: U.S. Marine Corps)\n\nQuestions of Tennessee law at center of arguments\n\nSome of the arguments made Monday were arguments Scheck had made before, when Alley was still alive. Then, Scheck had argued that stains on the t-shirt that Collins was wearing and on her bra should be tested, as well as DNA from red underwear found by her body that the prosecution had argued belonged to the assailant.\n\nTennessee courts denied the petitions for DNA testing prior to Alley\u2019s execution, and much of the argument Monday centered around whether a 2011 ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court \u2014 issued five years after Alley\u2019s execution \u2014 would have entitled him to DNA testing had he still been alive.\n\nScheck argued that the ruling was \u201cclear\u201d and that \u201cif (Alley) were alive today, he would get testing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommon sense tells you that,\u201d Scheck said.\n\nAt 17 he was convicted for rape, murder: After 16 years in prison exonerated man will soon be a lawyer\n\nSteve Jones, assistant district attorney general, argued that the circumstances of that Tennessee Supreme Court ruling were different than Alley\u2019s case and that Alley already had full due process.\n\n\"He would not be entitled to post-conviction DNA testing if he were alive today,\" Jones said.\n\nJones also argued that Tennessee law guarantees a right to post-conviction relief for \"a person convicted or sentenced.\u201d In this case, the petition was filed by the estate for Sedley Alley, not the person, he said, making it not applicable.\n\nA tip led to renewed quest for DNA testing\n\nThe Innocence Project decided to become involved years after Alley\u2019s execution when it learned a man had been arrested for murder and previously charged with rape. That man had gone to the same training school as Collins and matched a suspect description, Scheck said. They also had suspicions about a boyfriend of Collins.\n\n\u201cWe got that communication and we asked that question: Oh my god, is the evidence still there?\u201d Scheck said.\n\nApril Alley, daughter of Sedley Alley, listens as Barry Scheck, Innocence Project co-director, speaks Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, during a hearing at the Shelby County courthouse in Memphis. (Photo: Max Gersh / The Commercial Appeal)\n\nThe evidence from 1985 remains in storage in Shelby County. The petition asks that 17 items be tested.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason we are here is April Alley wants to know the truth,\u201d Scheck said. \u201cShe has the courage to seek the truth here and DNA testing can, as it has in hundreds of post-conviction cases since we founded the Innocence Project 28 years ago, provide that truth.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the DNA analysis statute is not just to exonerate the innocent, Scheck said, but also to identify actual assailants. Their petition asks that the DNA be compared with preserved samples of Sedley Alley's DNA as well as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).\n\nDeath row exonerees attend in support\n\nApril Alley was present at the hearing Monday, sitting beside her lawyers. She didn\u2019t take questions from the media.\n\nAlso present were three people who have been exonerated from death row: Kirk Bloodsworth, Sabrina Butler and Ray Krone.\n\nBloodsworth, the first American sentenced to death to be exonerated by DNA testing, spoke about his own conviction for the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl before DNA proved his innocence and allowed the true assailant to be identified.\n\nDNA is cracking mysteries and cold cases: But is genome sleuthing the \u2018unregulated wild west?\u2019\n\nWhile Sedley Alley was alive, Bloodsworth had spoken before the Board of Probation and Parole on Alley\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cI was very disturbed,\u201d Bloodsworth said. \"I thought you should test the DNA. At the end of the day, this is all we\u2019re trying to do. We have a criminal justice system that\u2019s adversarial in nature, but it cannot be adversarial to the truth. In my opinion, we should test it.\u201d\n\nButler became the first woman exonerated from death row after being convicted of killing her nine-month-old son.\n\nOn Monday, she spoke about the pain of losing her son and expressed her sympathy for April Alley.\n\n\u201cTo feel her pain and know that she just wants the truth, she just wants to know, and is that so wrong?\u201d Butler asked. \u201cIs that so wrong?\u201d\n\nFollow Katherine Burgess on Twitter @kathsburgess.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/15/tennessee-inmate-executed-murder-could-exonerated-dna/3988186002/", "description": "After Sedley Alley's execution in 2006 for Suzanne Marie Collins' murder, a judge now heard DNA testing arguments from the Innocence Project.", "authors": ["Katherine Burgess", "Published P.M.
