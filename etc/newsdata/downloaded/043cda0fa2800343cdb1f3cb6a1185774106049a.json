That would be surrender,\" he said.\n\nOn the subject of \"the temperature of political debate\", Mr Farage referenced Commons Speaker John Bercow, former Labour PM Tony Blair and former Conservative PM John Major, all of whom were booed.\n\nHe went on to describe former Tory MP - now Independent Group for Change leader - Anna Soubry as the \"least popular figure with Leave voters\".\n\nOn a second referendum, Mr Farage said: \"Provided we were given a proper question with a genuine leave on the ballot paper we would vote to leave by a bigger margin.\"\n\nHe said there will \"not be violent riots on our streets because we have got a well-run sensible moderate democratic political party\".", "description": "At a Brexit Party rally, Nigel Farage says the Tories will lose votes if they keep Theresa May's deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FE74/production/_109004156_6e3d345e-d7cb-4db6-b479-67013c96b202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
