There\u2019s just one hitch: Musk said in sworn testimony recently that he\u2019s financially illiquid.\n\nMusk told the YouTuber he would make the donation on Twitter after some nudging by Marques \u201cMKBHD\u201d Brownlee, who has interviewed Musk in the past and is an avid Tesla fan. Musk initially showed interest yesterday, asking on Twitter about the type of trees being planted as part of MrBeast\u2019s fundraising effort. MrBeast responded that the trees are being planted on every continent save Antarctica; the type of tree depends on where it goes.\n\nThe fundraising program has been successful even without a Musk donation; MrBeast has raised more than $6 million. The project is a partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation. When Brownlee told Musk that, Musk replied, \u201csounds legit,\u201d and pledged to donate 1 million trees.\n\nOk, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 29, 2019\n\nIn the past, Musk has engaged in a playful back-and-forth with MrBeast, who\u2019s become famous on YouTube for philanthropic stunts that largely involve giving away huge sums of money, sometimes to total strangers. The YouTuber promised to purchase a Tesla after telling Musk he would do so if the chief executive hosted an episode of \u201cMeme Review\u201d on the channel of Felix \u201cPewDiePie\u201d Kjellberg. After Musk hosted Meme Review, MrBeast followed through. MrBeast has since asked Musk if he would help him \u201cvlog on the moon.\u201d\n\nAnd Musk did follow through on a previous donation he promised to make on Twitter: one that helped schools in Flint, Michigan install UV water filtration systems for their water fountains after the Flint water crisis.\n\nBut Musk\u2019s Twitter use isn\u2019t all positives; he\u2019s now embroiled in a Twitter-related defamation suit. Last year, Musk used his Twitter audience of nearly 30 million to call a British cave diver named Vernon Unsworth \u201cpedo guy,\u201d after Unsworth criticized Musk\u2019s attempts to aid the rescue of a boys soccer team in Thailand that had become trapped in a cave. Musk later told BuzzFeed News that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist,\u201d adding, \u201cI fucking hope he sues me.\u201d Unsworth filed a defamation suit against Musk, and the trial is now set to begin in Los Angeles on December 3rd.\n\nHow does this relate to a relatively benign promise to donate trees to the Arbor Day Foundation? Well, in a recent court filing, Musk told lawyers representing Unsworth that, despite his massive stock holdings in Tesla and SpaceX, he was financially illiquid, according to The Los Angeles Times. That means his insurer, American International Group Inc., may get involved in any potential court settlement or financial payout as a result of the case. It also means it\u2019s an open question whether Musk has the cash on hand to help MrBeast plant all those trees for charity.", "description": "Elon Musk has promised to donate $1 million worth of trees ($1 per tree) to YouTuber Jimmy \"MrBeast\" Donaldson, who\u2019s currently campaigning to raise $20 million from fellow YouTube celebrities for a climate change fundraising effort.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bFE-sDHe-uS9Wp2a_VgG_O1iiA=/0x0:5568x2915/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19329763/1175368064.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
