Not just when we\u2019re on the cover of magazines, but when we are in the streets, when we are poor, when we are sex workers. When our hair \u2018aint laid. When we can\u2019t afford Louis Vuitton. Or when we can\u2019t get access to a hormone shot. And especially when we are dying.\u201d\n\nFollowing their speech, the entire room of guests gave Moore a standing ovation.\n\nThe actor shared a similar message on Instagram the following day, writing: \u201cJust like me, these women dared to exhaust their freedom to exist by being visible, however, instead of being celebrated they're punished for it.\n\n\u201cWhile we make up 0.6 per cent of the American population, the life expectancy of a trans woman and femmes is 35 years old. That means simply that I may not live past 35 simply because I'm black and trans. Existence that requires bravery is not freedom. A life that requires bravery is not free.\u201c\n\nIn July, the 12th known transgender person to violently die in the US this year was found fatally shot in South Carolina.\n\nChase Glenn, the executive director of the Alliance For Full Acceptance in North Charleston, said that 29-year-old Denali Berries Stuckey was the third known black trans woman murdered in South Carolina since 2018.\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Campaign, all the trans victims in 2019 have been black transgender women.", "description": "Indya Moore has paid homage to the lives of all the American trans women who have been murdered in the US this year with a pair of bespoke earrings.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/07/09/indya-moore.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
