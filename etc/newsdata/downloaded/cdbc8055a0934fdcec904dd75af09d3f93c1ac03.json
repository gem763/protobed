Mandatory Credit: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Swiss third seed fired 35 winners and 10 aces to see off the outclassed Belgian in a speedy 80 minutes on a sunny day at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nThe 38-year-old Federer was at his best when it mattered most, converting nine of his 10 break point opportunities to set up a meeting with Grigor Dimitrov on Tuesday.\n\nThe only drama came early when Goffin, seeded 15th, broke Federer to take a 2-1 lead in the first set but the Swiss broke back in the next game and cruised to the finish line.\n\n\u201cSometimes these scores just happen,\u201d Federer told reporters.\n\n\u201cYou catch a good day, the opponent doesn\u2019t, then things happen very quickly.\n\n\u201cI found my groove after a while and was able to roll really. Never looked back. David wasn\u2019t nearly as good as I expected him to be. He was struggling a little bit today. I was able to take advantage of it, and I think that\u2019s the key.\u201d\n\nGoffin was downbeat after his ninth loss in 10 matches against Federer.\n\n\u201cI gave completely,\u201d Goffin told reporters.\n\n\u201cOf course he was great, but I gave the whole match. It\u2019s tough to say. But, yeah, probably my worst match against him.\u201d", "description": "Roger Federer destroyed David Goffin 6-2 6-2 6-0 on Sunday to reach the U.S. Open quarter-finals and keep his bid for a record-extending 21st Grand Slam title alive.", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190901&t=2&i=1425145095&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF801ZZ"}
