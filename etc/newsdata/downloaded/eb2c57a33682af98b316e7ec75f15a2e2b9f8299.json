Koudryavtsev, who represented himself in court, had been found fit to stand trial after psychiatric reports.\n\nOpening the facts of the case, Anthony Orchard QC told how Koudryavtsev called the police three days after the killings, saying he wanted to \u201csurrender himself for murder\u201d. Officers arrived at the home in Adair Tower and found Tatiana, a former university lecturer, dead in the bath fully clothed and her husband\u2019s body in the bedroom.\n\nAfter Koudryavtsev\u2019s arrest in Chiddingfold, Surrey, on 23 May, police seized a hunting knife and a combat knife from the flat. In a police interview, Koudryavtsev said he loved Enzo more than his wife and had a strained relationship with his parents, who did not appreciate that dogs were \u201cequal to humans\u201d.\n\nThe court was told Tatiana had degrees in chemistry and history of art, and Vladimir had a PhD in physics and maths and had been given just weeks to live after suffering from cancer and strokes.\n\nThe court heard Koudryavtsev had emigrated to New Zealand in 2002 and worked on visual effects for the Lord of the Rings films before moving back to East Horsley, Surrey, with his wife. While living in New Zealand he had got two dogs, Boris and Nikita, and when Boris became ill and had to be put down, he got a mastiff puppy, Enzo. When Nikita died, Koudryavtsev became \u201cscary\u201d to live with and blamed his wife for the death of his pet, the court was told.\n\nKoudryavtsev, who was described as \u201cexceptionally clever\u201d but lacking in social skills, had moved back in with his parents with Enzo after the breakdown of his marriage. While living there he became \u201cfrustrated and angry\u201d at them for leaving the window open while the dog had a tooth infection.\n\nThe day before the killings, Tatiana told a friend her son had become abusive and obsessed with his dog, to the point where she could not open a window in case it got a cold. The next morning she told a friend at a pharmacy: \u201cI\u2019m scared to go home. I\u2019m terrified what he can do.\u201d\n\nKoudryavtsev told the court he had practised martial arts with knives for the past 17 years and \u201cfantasised\u201d about killing his parents for up to four months. He said he had taken his hunting knife and grabbed his mother by the head and stabbed her in the neck repeatedly, before stabbing his father twice.\n\nHilliard said Koudryavtsev\u2019s parents\u2019 lives \u201cmust have been very difficult indeed\u201d in their final weeks. The judge said: \u201cA friend said the two of them were very much in love and very proud of you and your achievements.\u201d", "description": "Visual effects technician Sergey Koudryavtsev admitted murder following dispute over his pet", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3976de9c7267a51bee8e646843e9e04e5d99f67/0_300_810_486/master/810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13d8daa8f6a45085e10d47437b8cd668", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
