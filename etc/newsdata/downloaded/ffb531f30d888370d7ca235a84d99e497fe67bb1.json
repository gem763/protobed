And the product was his much-ballyhooed border wall.\n\nTrump used just about every sales trick he honed as a real estate developer and promoter here Wednesday to showcase a newly built section of barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates and other critics denounce it as a menacing testament to inhumanity and cruelty, but Trump hawked the massive fence as a feat of innovation and ingenuity \u2014 the physical manifestation, although for now only in partial form, of his signature campaign promise.\n\nTaking reporters on an afternoon pilgrimage to a dusty construction site in the Otay Mesa area of San Diego, Trump boasted of the structure\u2019s design features as if he were still in his pre-presidential life pitching investors on a glimmering new condo building.\n\n\u201cWe have a wall the likes of which very few places have ever seen,\u201d Trump said at the start of a 37-minute presentation that he and his top immigration officials made to journalists. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is beyond.\u201d\n\nThe president was armed with facts and figures. He talked up the wall\u2019s height (between 18 feet and 30 feet, depending on the risk assessment of the location); its projected length (\u201cclose to 500 miles\u201d by the end of next year); and its depth (the steel bollards and concrete go about six feet into the ground).\n\n\u201cIt really is virtually impenetrable,\u201d Trump said, comparing it favorably to previous barriers. \u201cAny walls that were put up, we can knock down very quickly, very easily. This wall is not something that can be really knocked down.\u201d\n\nTrump tried to brush over the reality that Mexico is not paying for the barrier, as he had promised throughout his 2016 campaign. Construction is being funded with U.S. taxpayer money after the president used emergency powers to tap funding that Congress had allocated for Pentagon projects.\n\nTrump said that he tried to lower the cost. \u201cI said, \u2018Fellas, how about doing a less expensive version?\u2019 \u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, this is the version that works, including the poured concrete in the steel with the rebar and everything else.\u2019 That\u2019s the Rolls-Royce version.\u201d\n\nTrump played up the dangers from which the barrier is protecting Americans. \u201cTijuana is right over there,\u201d he said, referring to the notoriously crime-ridden city on the Mexico side. Two barriers were being erected here: An 18-foot structure on the Mexico side and a 30-foot structure on the U.S. side, with a road between them on which U.S. agents could patrol.\n\nTrump promoted the barrier\u2019s design as all the better to keep unwanted migrants on the Mexico side. Steel bollards, which look like hard-edge industrial tubes, are rooted deep in the ground and rise straight up into the sky. Concrete is then poured into the hollow interior to fortify the structure.\n\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to cut it with a blow torch, that doesn\u2019t work because you hit concrete, and then if you think you\u2019re gonna go through the concrete, that doesn\u2019t work because we have very powerful rebar inside,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump explained that the steel panels atop the bollards are designed to absorb heat from the broiling sun, a mechanism to further scare away would-be intruders.\n\n\u201cYou can fry an egg on that wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hot, so if they\u2019re going to climb it, they\u2019re going to have to bring hoses and water, and we don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to hook it up because there\u2019s not a lot of water out here.\u201d\n\nAlthough he had once advocated for the barrier to be painted black to better absorb heat and to have spikes at the top, features intended to injure perpetrators, Trump said the government was keeping the steel natural \u2014 \u201ca good, strong, rust color\u201d \u2014 while reserving the option to paint it at a later date.\n\nTrump said design prototypes had been stress-tested. \u201cWe had 20 mountain climbers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all they do. They love to climb mountains. They can have it. Me, I don\u2019t want to climb mountains, but they\u2019re very good. Some of them are champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls and this one was hardest to climb.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis wall can\u2019t be climbed,\u201d Trump added. Later, he allowed, \u201cI guess maybe one of the greatest pole vaulters in history can get over the low one, but it\u2019ll be very painful when they land.\u201d\n\nTrump was flanked by top immigration officials, who nodded in agreement with the president\u2019s declarations and offered their own testimonials. They were like certified experts giving a new product the Good Housekeeping Seal.\n\n\u201cThis design, it\u2019s a game-changer,\u201d said Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAt one point, Trump nearly gave up operational secrets.\n\n\u201cOne thing we haven\u2019t mentioned is technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re wired so that we will know if somebody\u2019s trying to break through, and you may want to discuss that a little, General.\u201d\n\nLt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commanding general of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees construction of the border barrier, demurred.\n\n\u201cSir, there could be some merit in not discussing that,\u201d he said.\n\nSo Trump opted instead for a casual summary: \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you they\u2019re wired, okay?\u201d\n\nTrump later touted the barrier\u2019s technological advances. \u201cNow we have a world-class security system at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cI would think that there\u2019s no place like this anywhere. No place has anything like this or even close to it. Other places have guards, and unfortunately they have machine guns and they have electrified fences \u2014 you touch them and you get electrocuted \u2014 but we don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nAs the event went on, it may have sounded to some like Trump was on an ego trip, but Morgan sought to dispel that notion.\n\n\u201cSir, if you don\u2019t mind, I think this is important to talk about,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a false narrative out there that this wall is the president\u2019s \u2018vanity wall.\u2019 I\u2019m here to tell you right now that\u2019s false.\u201d\n\nTrump seemed delighted by the acting commissioner\u2019s performance. As Morgan spoke, the president locked eyes with a Washington Post reporter, smiled widely and nodded, as if to signal that he knew exactly what Morgan was up to.\n\nTrump was clearly taken by the steel fortress rising from the dirt and he hoped the journalists were, too. \u201cI wanted to have you here because nobody would believe this unless they see it,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you\u2019re impressed. . . . This is top of the line.\u201d\n\nAs he finished, the president was informed of a tradition at the border that anyone who works on the wall signs it. Trump, who autographs everything from photographs of himself to news articles about himself, leaped at the chance.\n\n\u201cSign it?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll sign it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nAboard Air Force One for the flight back to Washington, Trump strode back to the press cabin to boast more about his achievement. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got to see it,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe president sounded like he was seeking affirmation from people bound by professional ethics not to provide any.\n\n\u201cI hope you like the wall, by the way,\u201d he told the traveling press pool. \u201cDo you like the wall?\u201d\n\nTrump fielded questions about other topics, but before returning to his cabin at the front of the plane, he came back to what had been at the top of his mind.\n\n\u201cI hope you see the wall is what it is,\u201d he told the journalists. \u201cIt\u2019s a great structure and it\u2019ll really do the trick.\u201d", "description": "Trump hawked a massive stretch of border fence as a feat of innovation and ingenuity \u2014 the physical manifestation, for now only in partial form, of his signature campaign promise.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NGMX5GG2OAI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
