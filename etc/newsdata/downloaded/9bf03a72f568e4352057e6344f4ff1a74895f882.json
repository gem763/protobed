The border wall that the Trump administration promotes has showcased the country\u2019s real attitude toward minority groups. How could they really care about the rights of Muslims living far away in Xinjiang? U.S. government\u2019s moves concerning Xinjiang are going against the betterment of the situation in Xinjiang as well as vital development and prosperity in the region. This shows that adding more Chinese entities to the blacklist and visa restrictions on Chinese officials are obviously geopolitical moves by the U.S. Xinjiang has made remarkable progress, with people enjoying human rights based on peace and stability. Having been through severe terrorist and extremist activities, Xinjiang has successfully protected the lives of numerous people and peace has returned to the region.
