Could it signal a recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth? in the second quarter it shrank by 0.2% but bounced back to 0.3% expansion in July.\n\nGeorge Buckley, chief UK and eurozone economist at the Japanese bank Nomura tells BBC Radio's 4 Today Programme that economists were forecasting no growth in August.\n\n\u201cEconomists are expecting it to be flat so no change at all but in some senses that\u2019s a good thing because the question would be, do you get some payback from the strength in July and if you don't then in the third quarter we could see positive growth [and] avoid this technical recession.\n\n\"I think there's a risk we see something worse in 2020 if there is a hard Brexit\".\n\nThe figure has been volatile because of building up stockpiles ahead of Brexit dates and then winding them down again, he said.\n\nHe added that the UK economy was \"seeking the knock-on effects of weakening growth everywhere\u201d in the world.
