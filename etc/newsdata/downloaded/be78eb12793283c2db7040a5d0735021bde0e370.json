But a second cyberstrike \u2014 after one launched against Iran just three months ago \u2014 has emerged as the most appealing course of action for Mr. Trump, who is reluctant to widen the conflict in a region he has said the United States should leave, according to senior American officials.\n\nBut even as the Pentagon considers specific targets \u2014 an attempt to shut down Iran\u2019s oil fields and refineries has been one of the \u201cproportionate responses\u201d under review \u2014 a broader debate is taking place inside and outside the administration over whether a cyberattack alone will be enough to alter Iran\u2019s calculations, and what kind of retaliation a particularly damaging cyberstrike might provoke.\n\n\u201cThe president talked about our use of those previously, but I\u2019m certainly not going to forecast what we\u2019ll do as we move forward,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d when asked whether a cyber attack might be an artful, non-escalatory response to this month\u2019s drone or missile strikes on two of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most important facilities. \u201cThis was Iran true and true, and the United States will respond in a way that reflects that act of war by this Iranian revolutionary regime.\u201d", "description": "As the United States weighs possible cyberattacks against Iran, it is looking for options that would deter Tehran from further strikes but avoid creating more conflict in the region.", "authors": ["David E.
