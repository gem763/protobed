(AP) - A small home-improvement company in West Virginia is taking on the nation\u2019s opioid giants in a lawsuit blaming the drugmakers for a rise in insurance costs.\n\nThe handymen at Al Marino Inc. filed the federal class-action suit last week in U.S. District Court against Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and a host of other companies.\n\nThe case claims the drug businesses created a public health crisis that increased the need for expensive medical treatments, leading to skyrocketing health insurance costs in West Virginia. It seeks unspecified damages.\n\nPurdue and Johnson & Johnson didn\u2019t return emailed requests for comment.\n\nAl Marino Inc. serves six counties in southern West Virginia with plumbing, electrical and other general home-improvement work.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of thousands seeking to hold the drug industry accountable for an opioid crisis that has killed more than 400,000 people over the past two decades. A potentially multibillion-dollar settlement deal involving more than 2,600 suits against Purdue is being hashed out in bankruptcy court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A small home-improvement company in West Virginia is taking on the nation's opioid giants in a lawsuit blaming the drugmakers for a rise in insurance costs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
