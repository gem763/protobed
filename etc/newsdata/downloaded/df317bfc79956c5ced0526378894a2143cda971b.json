In April, the company blocked a two-minute campaign video Trump posted because it used music from the Batman blockbuster \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d without authorization.\n\nStill, yanking the video was an exceptional move for Twitter, which has long resisted calls to crack down on Trump\u2019s tweets, in which the president pushes the limits of the social media platform\u2019s rules on a near-daily basis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump critics of all stripes have urged Twitter to curb his behavior on the platform, saying it runs afoul of the company\u2019s prohibitions on harassment and physical threats. Just Tuesday, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, sent a letter asking Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump\u2019s account, arguing that his tweets attacking the whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment inquiry violated the company\u2019s rules. Presented with similar requests in the past, Twitter has left Trump\u2019s tweets intact, arguing that a tweet\u2019s \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d should be considered in determining rule violations.\n\nTrump\u2019s Nickelback tweet was part of a volley of attacks he has fired off as he faces a ballooning impeachment inquiry into his efforts to press Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and the 2020 Democratic contender\u2019s family. In a series of broadsides earlier in the day, Trump called the probe \u201cBULLSHIT\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d and hurled insults at top Democrats, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who he said should be tried for treason.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on Democrats take a profane turn as impeachment inquiry advances\n\nThe inquiry stems from an extraordinary whistleblower complaint released last week alleging that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine while pressuring the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to find damaging information on Biden. Trump has accused the former vice president of trying to quash a corruption investigation of Burisma while his son was on the board there, and urged Zelensky to look into the claim in a July phone call. Ukrainian officials have said that Hunter Biden was not implicated in the investigation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJoe Biden, the top-polling Democrat in the 2020 field, responded to Trump\u2019s attacks an impassioned campaign speech in Reno, Nev., on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me, and you\u2019re not going to destroy my family,\u201d Biden said.\u201d I don\u2019t care how much money you spend, Mr. President, or how dirty the attacks get. Trump knows there are no truths in the charges against me.\u201d\n\nBiden, in fiery remarks, tells Trump: \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019\n\nThe video Trump tweeted is a riff on a quirky meme that first cropped up on social media several years ago. In the original music video, the Nickelback frontman \u2014 a frequent target of online mockery \u2014 holds up a framed picture of himself and a friend while singing: \u201cLook at this photograph. Every time I do it makes me laugh.\u201d An array of parody videos have emerged superimposing different images on the frame for comic effect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s version opens with a clip of Biden in a public setting saying he had never spoken with his son about his overseas business dealings. It then cuts to the segment from the Nickelback video, digitally edited to show a picture of Biden and his son standing on a golf course with Devon Archer, the younger Biden\u2019s business partner at Burisma, and an unidentified man.\n\nThe picture of the Bidens and Archer was initially surfaced by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, as The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Scherer noted Wednesday.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to discuss the decision to pull the video, saying only that the company responds to \u201cvalid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives.\u201d Warner Music Group didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nLive updates: Trump calls for China to investigate Bidens; former Ukraine envoy testifies on Capitol Hill\n\n\u2018Has anyone checked in on the president of Finland?\u2019: Trump\u2019s \u2018off the rails\u2019 performance turned a foreign leader into a meme\n\nTrump wanted to have U.S. forces equipped with bayonets to stop migrants at border, officials say\n\nBiden releases gun plan that would reinstate assault weapons ban and establish a voluntary buyback program\n\nAD", "description": "Twitter removed a meme tweeted by the president that used a parody of a Nickelback music video to attack former vice president Joe Biden, saying it had received a copyright complaint.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CjzDoQa2uNuLi8p4IAw6ugDWAS4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGIQDZMYMBDAXMR2D3UPT66PQY.PNG"}
