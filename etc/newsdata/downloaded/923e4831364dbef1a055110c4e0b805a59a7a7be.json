Blue stains remained on the road in front as worshippers gathered for prayers on Monday.\n\nLam visited the mosque on Monday morning dressed in a shawl, and apologised to Islamic leaders, according to a spokesman.\n\nChief Imam Muhammad Arshad said the apology was \"accepted\" and that the Islamic community hoped to continue living in Hong Kong in peace.\n\nThe police said in a statement the mosque had been accidentally sprayed and that they \"respect religious freedom and will strive to protect all places of worship\".\n\nCleaners wash the road outside the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre, which is located in one of Hong Kong\u2019s most popular tourist districts.

[Tyrone Siu/Reuters]\n\nSupport for economy\n\nThe protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he took power. Beijing has denied eroding Hong Kong's freedoms and Xi has vowed to crush any attempt to split China.\n\nAs the economy faces its first recession in a decade, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday offered more support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which have borne the brunt of the chaos.\n\n\"We are studying the launch of the third round of relief measures,\" he wrote on his blog.\n\nBusinesses will probably have to foot the bill for the vandalism, as few had insurance for riot damage, industry insiders said.\n\nProtesters are planning a demonstration at a shopping mall in the northern Yuen Long district from 7pm (11:00 GMT) on Monday to mark three months since activists were attacked by a mob in the area.\n\nMore than 100 men stormed Yuen Long station on the night of July 21 and attacked democracy protesters, passersby and journalists.\n\nMetro operator MTR Corp said it would shut Yuen Long station ahead of the planned protest.\n\nSeveral subway entrances and exits would also be shut, and the entire network would close two hours earlier than usual to allow time for the repair of facilities, the operator said.", "description": "Carrie Lam visited the Kowloon mosque, where the steps were dyed blue by the water cannon, on Monday morning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/2141d39db9a64d4b957bdb5fd846e5af_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
