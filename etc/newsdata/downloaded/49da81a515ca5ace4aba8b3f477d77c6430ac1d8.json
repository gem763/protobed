But that's not always the case, as Justin Thomas recently found out.\n\nIn a recent trip to the dermatologist, Thomas ran into a scare where a mole on his left leg was discovered to be in the early stages of melanoma. Lucky for him, it was found early enough to likely prevent any issues moving forward.\n\nAfter resolving the scare, Thomas took to social media to address the situation, and give warning to those who spend a lot of time out in the sun.\n\n\"No harm can come from [getting checked] and it's the best way to catch anything before it becomes a serious issue,\" Thomas said.\n\nAs the heat of summer begins to wind down, it might be time to put the sticks down and head to the doctor. Better safe than sorry.", "description": "Justin Thomas avoided a scare after a recent trip to the dermatologist left him with a nasty scar on his leg.
