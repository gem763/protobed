As prime minister he was talkative and straightforward. Many times, I am told, when there was a Downing Street meeting to discuss a leak inquiry there would be an embarrassed shuffle from the prime minister. \u201cActually\u201d, he would say, \u201cthat might have been me \u2013 I was sitting next to so-and-so at dinner\u2026\u201d\n\nThat means there is little new in his memoir, For the Record \u2013 certainly not in the extracts published so far. He didn\u2019t like the way Michael Gove and Boris Johnson fought the EU referendum campaign against him. He is proud of legislating for gay marriage. He thinks it was right to save the people of Benghazi from being massacred by Gaddafi.\n\nHe and his book are different from Tony Blair and his book. Blair concealed his inner workings, and so when he wrote so candidly about the layers of calculation by which he managed his political relationships, above all with Gordon Brown, it came as a revelation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWith Cameron, though, it was all out in the open. The central relationships of his time as prime minister were transparent. His partnership with Nick Clegg was even written down in a coalition agreement and depended on the mutual understanding of two similar and mostly predictable characters. His partnership with George Osborne was also easy to read and even more harmonious.\n\nSo when the end came for Cameron, his failure was rather more vivid than it has been for most prime ministers. With characteristic directness, he resigned the morning after the referendum was lost. He could fall back on no layers of ambiguity to conceal the sudden destruction of his reputation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Imagine the hysteria, some of it no doubt from the very same people, if he had tried to cling on to power and to implement a policy in which he patently did not believe.\n\nIndeed, it was the depth and sincerity of his belief in EU membership that was his undoing. Even those Remainers who blame Cameron for holding the referendum in the first place should recognise that.\n\nBut the idea that it is Cameron\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d that the people voted to leave the EU is another myth about his time as prime minister. This one is harder for Cameron to rebut, because there was undoubtedly an element of party political calculation in his promise of a referendum.\n\nIf he had not made that promise, the democratic pressure against EU membership would have diverted more of the Tory vote to Ukip, and Ed Miliband would have become prime minister in 2015. The Tories would have become a Eurosceptic party to get the voters back, promising a referendum, which would have been held whenever Miliband\u2019s minority government fell.\n\nMany Remainers would rather have taken their chances with putting off the inevitable referendum for as long as possible. But they ought to recognise that Cameron thought there was a better chance of winning it if he took it early, and if he led the campaign from government rather than Miliband\u2019s successor leading it from opposition (now there\u2019s a historical what-if).\n\nAs with so many prime ministers before him, Cameron was brought down by hubris. He did the brave and right thing in allowing Alex Salmond to hold a referendum in Scotland, and won it, becoming over-confident. Just as Gordon Brown was done in by the business cycle he thought he had abolished \u2013 \u201cno more boom and bust\u201d, followed by a global financial crash \u2013 and Blair brought low by assuming genocidal tyranny could be defeated in Iraq as easily as it was in Kosovo.\n\nThus Cameron had six years, and his achievements seem thin. He restored the public finances, although probably by making deeper cuts to spending than were needed. And I would argue (indeed have argued) he did the brave and right thing in holding a referendum on Europe.\n\nIf he had been as unprincipled as his detractors allow \u2013 or even as Eurosceptic as I thought he was when he became prime minister \u2013 he should have campaigned to leave, after the failure of his renegotiation of the terms of membership. He would probably still be prime minister now.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what he believed, and he paid the price for sticking to his beliefs. Just think of that the next time someone complains that politicians have no principles.", "description": "David Cameron was always an open book.
