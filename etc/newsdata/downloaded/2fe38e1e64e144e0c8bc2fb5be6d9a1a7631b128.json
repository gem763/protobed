The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them.\n\nThen, if the DUP won't support his deal, he'll need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents. Most will probably support the deal, but not all.\n\nThat's still not quite enough, though, so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents. In March, when MPs voted on Theresa May's deal for the third time, five Labour MPs backed it, plus two ex-Labour independents.\n\nThis time it's likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal.\n\nAll this still leaves the vote very close. And it's possible some MPs could abstain, making it even harder to predict the outcome.\n\nDo you have any questions about the proposed Brexit deal?\n\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.
