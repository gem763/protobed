It isn't. What we are seeing is an honest debate.\"\n\nOther senior figures in Labour like shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry - due to address delegates on Monday - also support a full-throated Remain stance.\n\nHilary Benn, Labour MP and chair of the Commons Brexit committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour's position of a second referendum was \"sensible\" and the \"the only way out of the deadlock we are facing\".\n\nBut he said it was clear the bulk of the party - and the shadow cabinet - had already confirmed they would back Remain.\n\nIt is going to be a very bumpy day. This afternoon the Labour Party, in all its glory, will debate the two positions of Leave and Remain.\n\nOne motion is overtly, full-throated, \"Labour must campaign now to stay in the European Union.\"\n\nThe other, the leadership position that was agreed in a small meeting with the unions some weeks ago, is to wait and see.\n\nNow, of course, there is a logic in that position, trying to straddle both sides of the debate and trying to have an offer for people who voted for Brexit.\n\nBut there is such frustration about that here at conference - you can hear it boiling over in the bars and in every single fringe event.\n\nThe reason why it matters is not just that Labour has found it hard making its mind up about Brexit, but also we might be just a couple of months from a general election.\n\nLabour is being radical this week, putting forward lots of ideas like free personal care, making it easier for people to buy electric cars and abolishing prescription charges.\n\nBut while people here are arguing about Brexit, the idea that comes from the conference to the country is about a party at odds with itself, fighting against itself, not a government in waiting.\n\nAndrew Lewin, of Remain Labour, said the prospect of alternatives being put to a vote was \"a huge step forward\".\n\n\"Labour members will tomorrow have the chance to change party policy - so Labour commits to campaign to Remain in all circumstances,\" he said.\n\nMichael Chessum, of left-leaning group Another Europe, told the BBC that Monday's vote was not just about Brexit.\n\n\"It's about where Mr Corbyn and the unions are really willing to listen to party members,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is asked if he will serve five years if elected PM\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday, Mr Corbyn would not be drawn on which side he would back, saying \"let's see\" what kind of new deal he was able to negotiate with the EU.\n\nHe said the party must respect the result of the Brexit referendum and do more to understand why people voted to leave.\n\nAway from Brexit, Labour has announced a pledge to introduce free personal care in England for over-65s most in need of it, so they will not have to pay for help with dressing, washing and meals.\n\nAt the moment, those with savings of more than \u00a314,250 have to contribute to the cost of home or residential help.\n\nIt is the latest of several new policies announced at the conference, including pledges to:\n\nGet rid of Universal Credit\n\nScrap Ofsted, which it called \"unfit for purpose\", and replace it with a new schools inspections system\n\nMake NHS prescriptions free in England, bringing it in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nForce large employers to provide flexible working hours to women experiencing symptoms of the menopause\n\nOn Sunday, party members also voted in favour of integrating private schools into the state sector.\n\nIndependent schools would have their charitable status withdrawn, as well as other public subsidies and tax privileges, and universities would have to admit the same proportion of private school students as in the wider population, currently 7%.\n\nThe vote means members have signalled a desire for the policy to be included in Labour's next general election manifesto.\n\nThe start of the conference, on Saturday, was overshadowed by a failed attempt to oust deputy leader Tom Watson.\n\nMr Watson later said he was disappointed by the move but called for unity.\n\nAnd on Sunday, one of Mr Corbyn's senior aides, Andrew Fisher, announced his intention to resign as head of policy.\n\nMr Corbyn confirmed that Mr Fisher was leaving, saying it was a \"very stressful and full-on job\".", "description": "Members at the party's annual conference will choose between backing Remain or staying neutral.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A974/production/_108908334_4bfd4642-9c54-4040-87f0-92f1d7fd293f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
