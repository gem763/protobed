This will immediately create more space for English players rising through the ranks.\n\n\u201cIt could be very positive,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s at the position where we\u2019ve held different talks with stakeholders, particularly the Premier League, but we get to the point where we\u2019re at a bit of an impasse on the fact we really don\u2019t know what the government are doing at the moment.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of theorising going on about what might happen. We\u2019ve had fairly productive talks but we can\u2019t do anything concrete until we actually know what the law is going to look like. My feeling is that at the moment we\u2019re running around 32-34 per cent of players playing in the Premier League [being English] so just over a third. And therefore we want to keep that and try and improve on that.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is have regulations which knock us back to where we were at ties last season, down to 26-27 per cent. We definitely want the Premier League to remain the best league in the world. We definitely want to make sure the Premier League is a very attractive league and proposition, but at the same time we want to be able to get exposure for young England players. It\u2019s a combination of what\u2019s happens with Brexit, can we change people\u2019s mindsets, can the players showcase themselves any way and get managers thinking in a different way?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We\u2019re the governing body. The immigration are quite clear on that, we\u2019re the governing body, we have to run the endorsement process to bring them in.\n\n\u201cIt's a case of how do we adapt the current regulations around that when the entire world becomes a market place because what we don't want to do is stifle what's been happening in terms of European qualified players but at the same time by going worldwide, it's going to be a massive market so we need to have regulations around the endorsement that mean we can protect our pool of talent that are homegrown.\u201d", "description": "Brexit could be a \u201cpositive\u201d for young English footballers as it is likely to give them more playing opportunities, according to FA technical director Les Reed.
