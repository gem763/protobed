Show Hide Why are people protesting? The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. Public anger \u2013 fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators \u2013 has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive, densely populated cities. The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station \u2013 while authorities seemingly did little to intervene. Underlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.\n\nProtesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill. Lam announced on 4 September that she was withdrawing the bill. Why were people so angry about the extradition bill? Beijing\u2019s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges. Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland. How have the authorities responded? Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets. Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d. Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong Kong\n\nAmnesty found that in 18 out of 21 cases, protesters in the semi-autonomous city \u2013 which was returned to China from the UK in 1997 \u2013 reported that they were admitted to hospital following arrest or detention, with injuries ranging from head wounds to fractured arms.\n\nOne protester told Amnesty that he had been beaten by special tactical officers, commonly known as \u201craptors\u201d, when he was arrested in August at a demonstration in Kowloon.\n\n\u201cImmediately, I was beaten to the ground. Three of them got on me and pressed my face hard to the ground. A second later, they kicked my face \u2026 The same three [tactical officers] kept putting pressure on my body,\u201d he said, adding that he then had difficulty breathing and pain in his ribcage. \u201cThey just said to me, \u2018Just shut up, stop making noise.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn exceptional cases, a few protesters reported that they were also beaten by officers in detention and suffered \u201cill-treatment [amounting to] torture\u201d. One man reported that police beat him after he refused to answer questions and threatened to \u201cbreak his hands if he tried to protect himself\u201d.\n\nWhat are the Hong Kong protests about?

She added that \u201criot police and plainclothes officers have shown no restraint while performing their duties\u201d.\n\nAlthough the chief executive, Carrie Lam, this month formally withdrew the extradition bill that first sparked demonstrations on 9 June, protesters say they will not go home until she meets all five protest demands, including an independent inquiry into police violence.\n\nLam has offered to initiate a \u201cplatform for dialogue\u201d with community stakeholders as well as a review by the Independent Police Complaints Council, but protesters have said they do not trust the council, or her. This month the chief executive has experienced some of her lowest ratings since protests began. The secretary for security, John Lee, who oversees the police, has also seen his approval rating bottom out.\n\nHong Kong protests \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nMistrust in police remains widespread even as frontline protesters have escalated their tactics to include petrol bombs, bricks and in some cases even fighting with officers with sticks and hiking polls.\n\nProtest chants have called for police to \u201creturn the eye\u201d of one woman who was severely injured by a police bullet, while another has asked police to reveal the \u201cmissing\u201d protesters who many believe disappeared after an intense clash at a subway station on 31 August.\n\nTed Hui, a Democratic legislator who has attended protest frontlines as an observer and was arrested this month for \u201cobstruction\u201d, told the Guardian that police use of batons \u2013 in lieu of rubber bullets \u2013 had ramped up since August, and that he had personally seen protesters hit on the head and across their body.\n\nHe said many of those arrested at anti-government demonstrations, who now number about 1,400, were not frontline protesters throwing petrol bombs but rather those standing farther back or even bystanders observing the conflict.\n\n\u201cI would say that many times the arrests are unlawful and arbitrary. I see the radical protesters, who really use some level of force, protest and [then] they are gone very quickly and so the police are not able to arrest them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInstead, the police are there to arrest other people \u2013 even those people who are peaceful protesters and they just joined the rally and they just have a mask with them and that\u2019s it, without any other weapons. They will arrest them just because they look young or they are in black shirts or masks.\u201d", "description": "Amnesty International report cites beatings, arbitrary arrests and \u2018thirst for retaliation\u2019", "authors": ["Erin Hale"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d44fc69ffd8ee64872d3f19c05c5130173bfb4b/0_186_5576_3346/master/5576.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=02abcf6683ad73bb3d11f08f82986513", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
