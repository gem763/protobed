REUTERS/Aaron Josefcz/File Photo\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator who is in a virtual tie with former Vice President Joe Biden in many opinion polls in the Democratic race, argued for her proposal to split up major tech firms such as Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc over antitrust concerns, in what was the most wide-ranging discussion of big tech in the Democratic debates to date.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It\u2019s time to fight back,\u201d Warren said in the debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nBut she did not engage with the request by Harris, also a U.S. senator, that she join her in calling for Twitter Inc to suspend Trump\u2019s account. Harris has argued that Trump uses the platform to intimidate his opponents and threaten violence.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of safety and corporate accountability,\u201d Harris pushed, while Warren refused to engage, instead saying she was focused on beating Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That\u2019s our job,\u201d Warren responded.\n\nWarren, who said on Tuesday she would not accept campaign contributions of more than $200 from executives at large tech companies or big banks, then pivoted to focus on whether candidates were taking money from big tech.\n\nSocial media companies, which are under pressure to police their platforms in the run-up to the 2020 election, have most recently been attacked by Democratic candidates, including Warren and Biden, for allowing politicians to run ads with false or misleading claims on their platforms.\n\nThis month, leaked audio from an internal Facebook meeting in July disclosed Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg telling staff they would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to defeat Warren\u2019s expected effort to break up the company if she is elected president.\n\nThe other Democrats on stage did not explicitly endorse Warren\u2019s plan to split up the major tech firms but voiced concerns about competition.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, another longtime critic of big tech firms and corporate influence, said the United States needed a president with \u201cthe guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke said he would be \u201cunafraid to break up big businesses\u201d but that he did not think it was the president\u2019s role to designate which companies should be broken up.\n\nIn a moment that swiftly generated memes on Twitter, entrepreneur Andrew Yang took a swing at Microsoft Corp\u2019s search engine Bing.\n\n\u201cCompetition doesn\u2019t solve all the problems. It\u2019s not like any of us wants to use the fourth-best navigation app,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThere is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft, it\u2019s true,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBing just got dunked on, feel free to google it tomorrow,\u201d tweeted comedian Aparna Nancherla.\n\nYang also argued that people should receive a share of the economic value generated from their data.\n\n\u201cHow many of you remember getting your data check in the mail?\u201d asked Yang. \u201cIt got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren went after big tech during the Democratic debate on Tuesday but brushed off rival Kamala Harris's challenge to join her in calling for President Donald Trump's suspension from Twitter.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Culliford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441365710&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0CJ", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
