(Photo by Tracey Nearmy/Getty Images)\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has responded to Greta Thunberg\u2019s speech before the United Nations by suggesting that the climate change debate gives kids \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in New York, Morrison asserted that the debate over how to address climate change is laden with \u201cmisinformation\u201d.\n\nAustralia was not invited to speak at the climate change summit due to our perceived unwillingness to cut carbon emissions.\n\nIf there\u2019s a poor stance to be taken on an issue pertaining to climate change, you can generally assume Australia is going to take it.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has responded to teen climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s impassioned plea for climate action by suggesting the climate debate is replete with \u201cmisinformation\u201d which is giving the world\u2019s kids \u201cneedless anxiety\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in New York, Mr Morrison called for \u201ccontext and perspective\u201d on the climate debate, which one can only assume means accepting Australia\u2019s dodgy management of carbon credits as an effective means of dealing with the problem.\n\n\u201cYou know, I want children growing up in Australia that feel positive about their future,\u201d the Prime Minister said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important that we give them that confidence, that they will not only have a wonderful country and pristine environment to live in, but they\u2019ll also have an economy that they can live in as well.\n\n\u201cSo I think we\u2019ve got to caution against raising the anxieties of children in our country.\u201d\n\nMr Morrison did not attend the UN climate summit on Monday, instead having Foreign Minister Marise Payne make a cursory appearance. Australia was disinvited from speaking at the summit, after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that only countries with concrete, workable climate action plans would be able to take the stand.\n\nGreta Thunberg\u2019s speech, in which she castigated world leaders for their inaction on the climate problem, has dominated headlines this week.\n\n\u201cI should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\u201d she said. \u201cYet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on that sentiment, Morrison suggested the world had dealt with existential threats before and could do so again.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve got to deal with the policy issues and we\u2019ve got to take it seriously, but I don\u2019t want our children having anxieties about these issues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI say this as a parent, too: we\u2019ve got to make sure that our kids understand the facts, but they also have the context and the perspective, and that we do not create an anxiety among children in how we talk about and deal with these very real issues.\u201d\n\nMorrison went on to say he does not impose any particular view on his children when it comes to climate change and emission targets.\n\n\u201cI encourage them to have a passionate, independent view about how they see the world, but I also give them a lot of context,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t allow them to be basically contorted into one particular view, I like them to make their own mind.\n\n\u201cBut I also like to give them reassurance because the worst thing I would impose on any child is needless anxiety \u2013 they\u2019ve got enough things to be anxious about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked kids to be kids. And we\u2019ve got to let kids be kids. We can\u2019t have them growing up as mushrooms either, but at the same time I think we\u2019ve got to get a bit of context and perspective into this.\u201d\n\nMorrison\u2019s appearance in New York follows a state visit with President Trump at the White House.\n\nWhile the climate summit was happening, the prime minister was in Chicago admiring the latest in \u2018smart drive-thru\u2019 technology from McDonald\u2019s. Our national priorities are obviously right where they need to be.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
