The first-half profit margin was 3.67 percent.\n\n\"Put quite simply he is the bloke that saved Tesco, which should go down as an enormous achievement in British retail history,\" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \"Murphy has big shoes to fill.\"\n\nTesco shares have risen 6 percent since Lewis started in September 2014, while the FTSE 100 index had risen 8.5% percent in the same period. Lewis, however, noted that Tesco's share price had increased about 40 percent since October 2014 when the group reported the full extent of the accounting irregularities.\n\nLewis overhauled Tesco's relationship with suppliers, lowered prices versus competitors, simplified product ranges and improved store standards. Jobs have also been cut, including 4,500 announced in August.\n\nThe 54 year old also pursued growth by buying wholesaler Booker for nearly 4 billion pounds ($4.9bn), forming a global purchasing alliance with Carrefour and launching a new discount format called Jack's.\n\nTesco chairman John Allan said Lewis had indicated to him a year ago of his plan for a 2020 departure, kicking off a succession process that also considered internal candidates.\n\nHe said Charles Wilson, the boss of Booker who was once seen as the frontrunner to succeed Lewis, did not want to be considered for the job.\n\n'A strong, strategic mind'\n\nMurphy was joint chief operating officer at Boots UK & Ireland before rising to executive vice president, chief commercial officer and president global brands at Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nHe left his executive position at the US retailer at the end of 2018 but retained a consultancy role, Tesco said.\n\n\"We wanted a combination of experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind and a track record in commercial and brand,\" said Chairman John Allan.\n\n\"Dave will be a hard act to follow, but Ken is unquestionably a seasoned, growth-orientated business leader.\"\n\nGiven contractual commitments to Walgreens, Murphy's precise start date will be announced in due course. He will join on a basic annual salary of 1.35 million pounds ($1.65m), compared with the 1.25 million ($1.5m) that Lewis earned in the 2018-19 financial year.\n\nLewis said he did not know if he had another big job in him.\n\n\"From the middle of next year I intend to take some proper time out with my family, recharge the batteries and then think about what might come next,\" he said.\n\nTesco also said on Wednesday it planned to step up its store opening programme and double its online capacity in the UK. It has also acquired wholesaler Best Food Logistics for a nominal sum.\n\nThe group said it had made a strong start to the year.\n\nHowever, UK like-for-like sales fell 0.3 percent over the full half year, having increased 0.4 percent in the first quarter.\n\nThe outcome partly reflected a tough comparative in the second quarter last year when a heatwave and the men's football World Cup boosted demand.", "description": "Dave Lewis will hand over to Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/90bc173b58c04e9aa99915c3af3f856a_18.jpg"}
