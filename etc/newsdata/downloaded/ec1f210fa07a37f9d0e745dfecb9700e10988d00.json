It's horrible', the soldier told Fox News. 'We met every single security agreement. The Kurds met every single agreement. There was no threat to the Turks - none - from this side of the border.\n\n'This is insanity. I don't know what they call atrocities, but they are happening.'\n\nSmoke billows out in the Syrian border town of Tel Abyad following Turkish airstrikes on Kurdish towns today\n\nIt comes as Donald Trump said he hopes he can mediate between Turkey and the Kurds following Turkey's offensive on US-allied Kurds in northeast Syria.\n\nHe defended his abrupt decision to pull out of northern Syria, allowing Turkey to attack Kurdish towns, at a campaign rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Thursday.\n\nTrump said he did not think Americans wanted to see the US military sent back into the region.\n\n'We have one of three choices: Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily, hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!', Trump tweeted.\n\nMilitary vehicles being deployed to Ceylanpinari district to support the units within 'Operation Peace Spring' in Turkey's Sanliurfa today\n\n'I hope we can mediate,' Trump said when asked about the options by reporters at the White House. 'Turkey knows where I stand'.\n\nUS officials confirmed the president had ordered the military to not get involved in the Turkish strikes, which have killed seven civilians since Wednesday.\n\nKurdish forces are now guarding thousands of captured Islamic State prisoners in northeastern Syria without the assistance of the US.\n\nThe insider added that the Kurds are 'pleading for our support' - but said the US forces are merely 'sitting by and watching it unfold'.\n\n'[Trump] doesn't understand the problem. He doesn\u2019t understand the repercussions of this. Erdogan is an Islamist, not a level-headed actor', he said.\n\nTrump ordered the pullback after a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday, prompting rare criticism from senior figures in his own Republican Party who accuse him of deserting loyal US allies - the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led by Kurdish YPG militia.\n\nDonald Trump (pictured on Thursday) pulled his forces from the area at the start of the week, allowing Turkey to attack Kurdish towns\n\nThe SDF have been the main allies of US forces on the ground in the battle against Islamic State since 2014.\n\nThe military source said he believes many of the captured Islamic State prisoners 'will be free in the coming days and weeks'.\n\nTurkish forces pushed deeper into northeastern Syria on Friday, the third day of Ankara's cross-border offensive against Syrian Kurdish fighters that has set off another mass displacement of civilians and met with widespread criticism from the international community.\n\nAir strikes, artillery bombardments and small arms fire raged throughout border settlements along the 75-mile front where 'Operation Peace Spring', as it was dubbed by Erdogan, is being focused after it was launched on Wednesday.\n\nThousands of people have fled their homes, piling trucks and cars high with their possessions, in a grim echo of how they sought refuge from the Islamic State only a few years before.\n\nPeople gather at the site of an explosion in the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli on Friday\n\nOn Friday, Turkish jets and artillery struck around Syria's Ras al Ain, one of two border towns that have been the focus of the offensive. Gunfire could also be heard inside the town, according to witnesses on the ground.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said Turkish forces seized two villages near Ras al Ain and five near Tel Abyad.\n\nA Syrian rebel forces spokesman said the towns were surrounded after fighters seized the villages around them.\n\nNATO member Turkey says the operation is necessary for border security against the YPG militia, which it designates a terrorist group because of ties to militants who have waged a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.", "description": "The Special Forces soldier is one of around\u00a01,000 US troops who remain in Syria after Donald Trump pulled his forces from the area at the start of the week, allowing Turkey to attack Kurdish towns.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19580494-0-image-a-29_1570806404632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
