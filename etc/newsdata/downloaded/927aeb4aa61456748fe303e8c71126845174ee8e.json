But, no one is (saying) 'Hey, what's going on with the stock?' They have all the perks of being a public company without responsibility.\"\n\nFirst United Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAhead of the bank's annual meeting earlier this year, Driver had also called for it to sell itself. Driver had a much smaller stake in First United at that time. It is now the bank's third largest shareholder with a more than 5% stake.\n\nDriver has had meetings with First United's board over the past several months but found it was not receptive to its suggestions, according to the letter. The investor thinks the bank's shares, now trading around $21, could fetch $26 to $33 in a sale, according to the letter.\n\nCooper said in the interview that without significant changes to its business, First United was unlikely to reach that valuation absent a sale.\n\nThe activist is urging that First United hire financial advisers to help the bank find a buyer.
