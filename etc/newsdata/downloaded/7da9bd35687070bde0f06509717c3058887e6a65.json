(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThis is how the Trump administration goes about the quiet business of incapacitating the U.S. government.\n\nPresident Trump spent his summer making war on Denmark, attacking Baltimore, destabilizing the world economy, sending an imaginary hurricane to Alabama and ousting his national security adviser, among other things. But while everybody was watching those fireworks, Trump\u2019s underlings \u2014 some far more competent than he \u2014 were toiling in the shadows to hand over public lands to the tender mercies of oil and gas companies.\n\nThe scheme, rolled out over the summer, was ostensibly to put the Bureau of Land Management closer to the lands it manages by moving personnel out of Washington. That makes sense until you consider:\n\n1. Ninety-seven percent of the BLM\u2019s employees already are outside of Washington, and the few hundred in the capital do things such as coordinate with Congress and other agencies; now half the congressional affairs staff, I\u2019m told, will work out of Reno, Nev. \u2014 2,600 miles from Capitol Hill.\n\n2. BLM organized this with cursory analysis of impacts and costs and no significant consultation with Congress, American Indian tribes or BLM staff.\n\n3. BLM decided to locate its new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., hours from a major airport but just down the road from the hometown of Interior Secretary (and former oil and gas lobbyist) David Bernhardt, who presides over BLM.\n\n4. The relocation was overseen by Interior assistant secretary Joseph Balash , up until days before he took employment for himself with an oil-exploration company.\n\n5. When Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) said it appeared that the proposal, which doesn\u2019t have congressional approval, was a \u201cdeliberate effort to dismantle\u201d BLM, Balash threatened Udall, saying he would \u201creconsider the relocation of additional Departmental resources to your State\u201d in retaliation.\n\n6. Many workers being shipped out of Washington are reportedly being offered lower-level, lower-pay jobs \u2014 confirming suspicions that the real purpose is to drive experts out of government and thereby shrink the agency.\n\nTrump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said as much last month. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to fire a federal worker. I know that because a lot of them work for me, and I\u2019ve tried,\u201d he told a GOP gala. \u201cBy simply saying to people, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re going to . . . move you out in the real part of the country,\u2019 and they quit \u2014 what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government.\u201d\n\nSince Balash left to join the oil industry, the unenviable task of explaining the relocation to Congress fell to his replacement, William Perry Pendley, who joined Interior after three decades of suing the federal government to weaken protections for federal lands. Pendley, serving in an \u201cacting\u201d capacity, hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate and perhaps couldn\u2019t be: His Twitter musings are a fevered collection of attacks on Democrats and celebrations of oil and gas drilling.\n\nPendley, with a Yosemite Sam mustache, informed the House Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday that \u201cwe will not dispose of or transfer in a wholesale manner our public lands.\u201d\n\nSo they\u2019ll do it piecemeal?\n\nHe volunteered that he\u2019s \u201cin full compliance with . . . President Trump\u2019s heightened ethics pledge.\u201d\n\nAs if that were reassuring.\n\nHe declared that the department is offering \u201cknowledgeable and compassionate assistance\u201d to those relocating. (Last week, he apologized to enraged employees that BLM had been \u201cless than transparent\u201d).\n\nRep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), a Native American, asked about his past mockery of native religions.\n\n\u201cI was not speaking as a member of the BLM,\u201d Pendley explained.\n\nRep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) asked for details on the many unfilled vacancies BLM already has.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that number,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) asked if BLM had studied the lost expertise the move would create.\n\n\u201cNo, Mr. Chairman.\u201d\n\nRep. TJ Cox (D-Calif.) asked for specific details of the relocation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to defer to congressional and legislative affairs,\u201d Pendley said.\n\nRight. In Reno.\n\nThe Trump administration has attempted similar relocations \u2014 read: job cuts \u2014 at the Agriculture Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Personnel Management and elsewhere. But 85 percent of the federal workforce already is outside the Washington area. And at BLM, which has only a few hundred of its 10,000 employees in Washington, the argument for decentralization is particularly weak. Even BLM\u2019s deputy director of operations, Mike Nedd, told employees last week that \u201cI probably would have made a different decision,\u201d E&E News reported.\n\nBut Pendley, at that same meeting, said the administration would push ahead with the plan, even if it doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds \u2014 because \u201cwe are confident that Congress will provide additional funding.\u201d\n\nAnd if not? Well, Trump can declare another emergency and take more money from the Pentagon. When your goal is kneecapping the federal government, anything goes.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The Bureau of Land Management move serves one nefarious purpose.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
