The professor said Stephens was trying to intimidate him over a harmless joke. Stephens deactivated his Twitter account but dug in during an MSNBC appearance, calling George Washington University professor David Karpf\u2019s tweet \u201cdehumanizing and totally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nKarpf thought the media circus was over by Friday. Then, the New York Times published a column by Stephens that, to many, seemed to compare Karpf\u2019s bedbug comment to Nazis\u2019 persecution of Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 sparking a new round of ridicule and prompting commenters to marvel at Stephens\u2019s ability to keep his name in the headlines.\n\n\u201cSo the Internet has been spending the entire week having good fun at [Stephens\u2019s] expense, because he was taking himself way too seriously,\u201d Karpf told The Washington Post on Saturday. \u201cAnd then he had to find a way to take himself that much more seriously, by using his column space in the New York Times to call me, a Jew, a Nazi.\u201d\n\nAccompanied by a headline that reads \u201cWorld War II and the Ingredients of Slaughter\u201d and headed by a photo of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, the column describes a modern-day resurgence of the kind of dehumanizing rhetoric the Nazis deployed against the Jews they sought to exterminate. Stephens does not name Karpf, but he compares Twitter to the young radio technology that broadcast hate in the 1930s and highlights language comparing Jews with despised insects, including bedbugs.\n\nKarpf said the implication that his tweet is comparable to anti-Semitic denigration of Jews \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem like a proportionate response.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes what all week has been a light, entertaining and funny story and crosses a line,\u201d he said.\n\n[A professor called Bret Stephens a \u2018bedbug.\u2019 The New York Times columnist complained to the professor\u2019s boss.]\n\nOthers reacted with similar disbelief, calling the apparent Nazi comparison inappropriate. One writer at Rolling Stone went so far as to say the piece should be retracted.\n\n\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t have @nytimes columns,\u201d Jamil Smith wrote.\n\nThat Bret Stephens column that not-so-subtly references Dave Karpf should be retracted. It knowingly slanders Karpf in the Paper of Record, likening a mild Twitter insult to the stuff of Nazis, and all because he got his feelings hurt. Children shouldn\u2019t have @nytimes columns. \u2014 Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) August 31, 2019\n\nBret Stephens just published a NYT column in which he likens being called a \"bedbug\" on Twitter to the political conditions of 1930s Germany. There is something seriously wrong with this guy \u2014 Michael Tracey (@mtracey) August 30, 2019\n\nThe Jewish professor who made a gentle joke comparing Bret Stephens to a bedbug, who is now being compared to Goebbels in the pages of the New York Times: https://t.co/zknZ42KZsi \u2014 Mark Gongloff \ud83d\udd31 (@markgongloff) August 31, 2019\n\nAnd some homed in on a hyperlink in Stephens\u2019s column that the Times removed Friday and said was \u201cadded by editors before publication to give readers a reference.\u201d The link led to a Google Books search for the phrase \u201cJews as bedbugs\u201d in a volume that one critic pointed out did not have any reviews on the site.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use a google books link, it\u2019s generally a good idea to remember to clear the search.\n\n\n\n(And maybe be a little wary if your only hit is an repurposed dissertation no one has bothered to review and that only equivocally supports your hypothesis.) pic.twitter.com/QC4hJ0KJfo \u2014 southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) August 30, 2019\n\nThe New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe controversy began earlier this week after reports of a bedbug infestation at the Times. Karpf, an activist and former Sierra Club board member who says he has been particularly disappointed with Stephens\u2019s takes on climate change, made a joke about the conservative writer, whose columns have prompted some dismayed readers to cancel subscriptions.\n\n\u201cThe bedbugs are a metaphor,\u201d Karpf tweeted Monday. \u201cThe bedbugs are Bret Stephens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe tends to write pretty lightweight, poorly researched columns about things that I know something about,\u201d Karpf explained later. \u201cSo I\u2019ve always seen him as this person that everyone complains about but we just can\u2019t get rid of. He\u2019s a bedbug.\u201d\n\nThe tweet seemed destined for obscurity. (Karpf did not tag Stephens\u2019s now-defunct Twitter handle.) But then Stephens emailed Karpf and copied George Washington University\u2019s provost. He invited the professor to come to his home, meet his family and call him a bedbug in person in an act that \u201cwould take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your [Karpf\u2019s] part.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people \u2014 people they\u2019ve never met \u2014 on Twitter,\u201d Stephens wrote. \u201cI think you\u2019ve set a new standard.\u201d\n\nStephens\u2019s response went viral as critics called it an overreaction. Karpf and others pointed to far more demeaning insults frequently aimed at other writers, especially women and people of color.\n\nStephens, who did not immediately respond to questions from The Post on Saturday, told the paper earlier this week that his email to Karpf \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d In an interview with MSNBC, he insisted he was not trying to land Karpf in hot water by copying his boss on the email. He also referenced a history of \u201ctotalitarian regimes\u201d comparing people with insects.\n\nStephens\u2019s column published online Friday evening ignited a new wave of criticism by wading further into those historical comparisons.\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is exactly the same as delousing,\u201d Stephens quotes Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler in his piece. Another statement he cites from an anti-Semite watching a ghetto burn makes the implied connection to Karpf\u2019s tweet more explicit: \u201cThe bedbugs are on fire. The Germans are doing a great job.\u201d\n\nStephens writes that \u201cthe rhetoric of infestation is back,\u201d pointing to President Trump and other leaders\u2019 descriptions of migrants. But he says the problem exists across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cMore of this talk will surely follow, and not just from the right,\u201d Stephens writes. \u201cThe American left has become especially promiscuous when it comes to speaking pejoratively about entire categories of disfavored people.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to describe the \u201cunpopular political figures of our day\u201d as \u201cthe moderate conservative, the skeptical liberal, the centrist wobbler\u201d \u2014 a position Stephens occupies as a conservative alienated by Trump whose positions have drawn fire from both the left and right.\n\nCriticism of Stephens\u2019s response to the bedbugs tweet has come from both the right and the left.\n\nFormer Trump White House spokesman Sean Spicer, no stranger to online ridicule, laughed at Stephens\u2019s indignation with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, saying, \u201cI think if that\u2019s the worst thing that he\u2019s been called, my goodness, take a look at my Twitter feed any day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese guys can\u2019t take a punch,\u201d he said.\n\nSome have defended Stephens. Letters published Saturday in the Los Angeles Times were critical of \u201cname-calling\u201d by Karpf, who detailed his takeaways from the spat with Stephens in the Times earlier this week.\n\nKarpf wrote in that piece that he thinks he has received \u201cremarkably little online abuse\u201d stemming from the exchange with Stephens because he is a white man.\n\n\u201cIf Stephens had directed his message to one of my female colleagues,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey would have faced much more online vitriol. \u2026 Many women with a public platform receive a death threat with their daily morning coffee.\u201d\n\nThat reality, Karpf told The Post, has made Stephens\u2019s decision to amplify his bedbug tweet all the more baffling. By the end of this week, the professor\u2019s Twitter feed was returning to normal. The media requests were thinning. The smart thing for Stephens to do, he said, would have been to let the dust-up die \u2014 a lesson he discussed earlier this week with students of his class on political communications.\n\n\u201cIt should have ended there,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cAnd then he decided he wanted to dunk on himself again.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nCounty GOP ad saying Jewish candidate is \u2018plotting a takeover\u2019 is slammed as anti-Semitic\n\nNew York Times demotes editor after Twitter controversy as paper takes fire from left, right and within", "description": "The New York Times published a column by Stephens that seemed to compare a professor's comment about bedbugs to the Nazi persecution of Jews during the Holocaust.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "Hannah Knowles Is A Reporter On The General Assignment Team.
