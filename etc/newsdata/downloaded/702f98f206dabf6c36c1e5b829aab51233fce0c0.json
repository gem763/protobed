Giordano)\n\nChoptank, a seafood restaurant that opened this week in the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore, posted a dress code on the gate outside its doors warning would-be diners of the kinds of sartorial statements not allowed in the establishment.\n\nAmong the banned items: baggy clothing (\u201cpants must be worn at the waist\u201d), backward or sideways hats and work and construction boots.\n\nA picture of the sign, posted to Twitter, drew criticism for seemingly targeting minorities. \u201c\u2019No POC\u2019 is much more succinct,\u201d commented one user. \u201cI dunno, prohibiting outside food and beverage seems reasonable. The rest is racist though,\u201d tweeted another.\n\n[The key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world]\n\nThe outrage really took off when R. Eric Thomas, a popular Baltimore-based writer, posted that Choptank had blocked him on Twitter after he asked the restaurant to \u201cexplain the rationale behind the restrictions.\u201d (It later unblocked him, he tweeted, though he wrote he wished the restaurant instead \u201cwould revisit the intentions and effects of the specificity of their dress code.\u201d)\n\nChoptank, whose marketing director did not respond to The Washington Post\u2019s calls or emails, responded on Twitter to the initial post, claiming the policy was standard operating procedure in the neighborhood. \u201cBeing new to the Fells Point neighborhood, we simply implemented the dress code standard that is used by several other properties in the area including Barcocina, Bond Street Social Moby\u2019s and The Horse You Came In On. Have a great day.\u201d\n\nBeing new to the Fells Point neighborhood, we simply implemented the dress code standard that is used by several other properties in the area including Barcocina, Bond Street Social Moby\u2019s and The Horse You Came In On. Have a great day. \u2014 The Choptank (@The_Choptank) September 16, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s at least partly wrong. Jassera Contreras, a host at Barcocina, said the restaurant has no such policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a dress code,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re casual fine dining but basically as long as you don\u2019t come in in your pajamas, you\u2019re okay. We\u2019ve never kicked anyone out or anything.\u201d\n\nAt Bond Street, there is no dress code on weekdays, a woman answering the phones said, but after 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, it bans hats of all kinds, boots, hoodies, baggy or ripped jeans, military attire, athletic footwear and tank tops on men.\n\nDress codes are fraught territory. Reuben A. Buford May, a sociology professor at Texas A&M who has studied discrimination in nightlife and public accommodations, says they are not bad in and of themselves. Upscale establishments, particularly nightclubs, might want to \u201cset a standard,\u201d he says. But when the language targets very specific styles, he adds, it indicates the restaurant might be singling out groups they find undesirable. On Choptank\u2019s sign, he noted the \u201cshorts below the knee\u201d could be shorthand for hip-hop inspired styles.\n\n\u201cAnytime you have something that specific, it\u2019s pretty likely it\u2019s being used in a discriminating way,\u201d May says. \u201cIt means that a particular group is being penalized for that being their style.\u201d\n\n[Bon App\u00e9tit named an Austin restaurant to its \u201850 best\u2019 list. Its editor-at-large works there.]\n\nOn the other hand, he notes, dress codes can also result in discrimination where they are vague. Choptank\u2019s ban on \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d attire is broad and undefined. But the part of Choptank\u2019s rules that most stood out to him was the final caveat: \u201cManagement may enforce these rules within its discretion,\u201d it reads. \u201cThat last line was the one that killed me \u2014 it says, \u2018we can pick and choose who comes in,\u2019 and that\u2019s where you could have total disrespect for the Civil Rights Act,\u201d May says.\n\nOther restaurants owned by Atlas Restaurant Group, which operates Choptank and 11 other establishments around the city, have dress codes. The policy at the Bygone, a swanky 1920s-styled restaurant in the Four Seasons hotel overlooking the city\u2019s harbor, forbids non-collared shirts and flip-flops. It states that it will be \u201cstrictly enforced,\u201d language May says is less problematic because it indicates the rules apply equally to everyone.\n\nAtlas is owned by brothers Alex and Eric Smith, whose father, Frederick Smith, is a co-owner and director of the conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group, which operates TV stations around the country.\n\nSuzanne Loudermilk, a Baltimore native and longtime food writer, said it is uncommon for any restaurant to have a dress code in Fells Point, a neighborhood she describes as having a casual vibe where shorts and T-shirts are the norm. The streets are paved in stones, she notes, making walking in heels difficult. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people try it, and it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d she said.\n\nShe wondered why Choptank, which bills itself as a \u201cfish and crab house,\u201d expects patrons to dress up at all. \u201cWhen people eat crabs, it\u2019s messy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to dress casually.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously\n\nWith his new chicken documentary, is Morgan Spurlock part of the solution and the problem?\n\nHow to make a martini your guests will love \u2014 or at least love to argue about\n\nThe real reason you should stop eating lunch at your desk", "description": "Choptank says it is just using the dress code standard set by neighboring restaurants.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Co-Author Of The Reliable Source", "September At Pm", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
