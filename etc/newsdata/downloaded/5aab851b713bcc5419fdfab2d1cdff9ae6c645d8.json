The email to Oracle employees was identical to the message Ellison wrote on Hurd\u2019s website.\n\nHurd recently went on medical leave, saying he needed \u201ctime focused on my health.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is with a profound sense of sadness and loss that I tell everyone here at Oracle that Mark Hurd passed away early this morning,\u201d Ellison wrote. \u201cMark was my close and irreplaceable friend, and trusted colleague. Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle.\u201d\n\nHurd, who had also served as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard, joined Oracle in 2010, when he became a co-president with Safra Catz. They were promoted to co-CEOs in 2014, when Ellison stepped down as chief executive and instead took the title of chief technology officer.\n\nHurd played a critical role in Oracle\u2019s growth over the past 10 years. He was also instrumental in Oracle\u2019s bid to establish a stronger presence in the cloud, where it is battling it out with rivals led by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nHurd became a prominent figure in Silicon Valley when he was tapped by Hewlett-Packard to be its CEO after the departure of Carly Fiorina. But his tenure ended amid allegations of sexual harassment. The HP board subsequently concluded that Hurd did not violate its sexual-harassment policy, though it did find irregularities in his expense-account reporting.\n\n\u201cAll of us will miss Mark\u2019s keen mind and rare ability to analyze, simplify and solve problems quickly,\u201d Ellison wrote. \u201cSome of us will miss his friendship and mentorship. I will miss his kindness and sense of humor.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI know that many of us are inconsolable right now, but we are left with memories and a sense of gratitude\u2026that we had the opportunity to get know Mark, the opportunity to work with him\u2026and become his friend.\u201d\n\nHurd is survived by his wife, Paula, and two daughters.", "description": "Business Insider - The news was shared on Mark Hurd's personal website on Friday..
