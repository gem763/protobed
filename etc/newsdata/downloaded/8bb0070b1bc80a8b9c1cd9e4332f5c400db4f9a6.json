Sometimes it comes across as him being very laconic but Mark Waugh was like that as well,\u201d Langer said last month.\n\nStuart Broad warns Steve Smith of brutal return in fourth Ashes Test Read more\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been the pin-up boy of Australian cricket in the sense that he knew what he had to do. He had to get fitter and stronger, he had to improve his fielding. He\u2019s done all those things. He\u2019s been very good as a leader.\u201d\n\nKhawaja suggested last week he still feels \u201creally good batting\u201d but a lack of big runs was \u201cobviously frustrating\u201d.\n\nMatthew Wade, who scored a century in Australia\u2019s series-opening victory then produced more modest returns with the bat at both Lord\u2019s and Headingley, had also been under the pump.\n\nAustralia have carefully managed the workload of their fast bowlers on this tour, especially Pattinson given it is the express paceman\u2019s long-awaited international comeback after three and a half years of injury hell.\n\nThere is a three-day break between the fourth and fifth Tests, all but ensuring the attack will be changed yet again for the series finale.\n\nAustralia XII for fourth Test: David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Matthew Wade, Tim Paine (captain), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Peter Siddle, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.", "description": "Usman Khawaja has been axed for the penultimate Test in Manchester, where Mitchell Starc and Peter Siddle are locked in a battle to claim the final spot", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60909872c438360f7e4c4045cdd92d60dd6f74d5/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa3c7db1551097184a09c00fd44f1d4b"}
