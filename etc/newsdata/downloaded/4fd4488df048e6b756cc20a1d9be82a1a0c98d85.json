No details were immediately available.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled territory has been tense for weeks, with protests often turning violent, as authorities scramble to avoid activists spoiling Beijing\u2019s birthday parade at a time when the central government is already grappling with a U.S.-China trade war and a slowing economy.\n\nPeaceful protests descended into chaos with police firing volleys of tear gas outside a famous Taoist temple in the residential district of Wong Tai Sin. At least eight motor-cycles were torched.\n\nNearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the gravest popular challenge to President Xi since he came to power.\n\nThousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, marched from Causeway Bay toward government headquarters in Admiralty, defying a ban on a rally and setting up the likelihood of clashes with police.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp shut down its whole metro system to stop protesters moving around. Shutting stations has made it a common target for attack, with several of its stations trashed over recent weeks.\n\nProtesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China\u2019s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China\u2019s economic and military progress.\n\nDemonstrators blocked roads across the territory in frantic game of cat-and-mouse with police, piling pressure on already stretched security resources.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not young, but if we don\u2019t march now, we\u2019ll never have the chance to speak to again, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.\n\nPolice said they arrested five people, aged between 17 and 25, in the central district of Wan Chai late on Monday after finding them with walkie-talkies, lighters and material for petrol bombs, including 18 litres (4.75 gallons) of fuel and empty bottles.\n\nHundreds of officials and members of the pro-establishment elite began the day with a flag-raising ceremony and National Day reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre, held early and moved behind closed doors. Roads to the centre were closed and tightly policed.\n\nHong Kong has benefited from China\u2019s support under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms after the city\u2019s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nHowever, he said escalating violence was disrupting social order and hurting the economy.\n\nAnti-government protesters march towards the Legislative Council, on China's National Day in Hong Kong, China October 1, 2019.

Its last forecast in July was for 2.2 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent for 2020.\n\nVisitor arrivals dropped 39% in August from a year earlier, with the number of mainland tourists to Hong Kong dropping 42.3% over the period, according to the latest data.\n\nCheung called a first \u201copen dialogue\u201d last week with citizens an important step and said more would follow.\n\nA group of protesters outside the venue shouted \u201cNo national day celebrations, only national day mourning\u201d, and called for those arrested during recent clashes to be released. Police fired pepper spray during a scuffle outside a nearby train station.\n\nThe government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already cancelled an annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety.\n\nLam, who was trapped in a stadium for hours last week after attending the \u201copen dialogue\u201d, left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China\u2019s birthday on the mainland. She will return on Tuesday.\n\nBEIJING PARADES\n\nIn contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nLam was shown on television smiling as a float celebrating Hong Kong went past as she sat with Chinese officials.\n\nThe Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong\u2019s unrest, slowing economic growth and a trade war with the United States.\n\n\u201cOn our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said in his nationally televised speech in Beijing.\n\nHong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial centre.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nLast month, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into the city. The Xinhua state news agency described the movement as routine rotation.\n\nAsian and Western envoys in Hong Kong, however, have said the absence of any evidence that troops had been withdrawn suggested it was a reinforcement, with the largest-ever regular army force now stationed in the city.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters threw petrol bombs and police fired tear gas in street battles across the city on Tuesday, posing a direct challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435788871&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9023O", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
