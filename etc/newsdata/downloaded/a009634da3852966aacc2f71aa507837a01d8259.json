Amazon\u2019s Ring, another doorbell camera, uses its own app, Neighbors. You can upload footage directly from your Ring camera to the app, and that footage is accessible by other users, including local police departments. For years I assumed the surveillance culture would be spearheaded by the state, but instead we\u2019re leading it ourselves.\n\nIf there\u2019s a compromise that offers security but also protects everyone\u2019s privacy, it\u2019s being mindful of the placement of security cameras so that they don\u2019t pick up everyday visitors or people on the street (which, for me, rules out doorbell cameras). It also means staying away from neighborhood apps and disabling the audio recording on cameras.\n\n[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information.

After all, the purpose of the camera is to keep your children safe, not to catch the nanny doing something wrong.\n\nGenerally speaking, you can legally record video in your home, though not in areas like bedrooms or bathrooms, where a person expects privacy. The legal line is typically drawn at recording audio, just as it is with outdoor cameras.\n\nOnce guests step into your home, they have a higher expectation of privacy. Although you may not be legally required in your state to tell visitors they\u2019re on camera, you really should. It\u2019s a terrible feeling to find out you\u2019ve been recorded, even if you weren\u2019t doing anything interesting. Indoor cameras with audio can easily pick up private footage, like a friend who casually dunks on your choice of throw blanket, or a sibling who disciplines her children.\n\nWhereas outdoor cameras are typically used only for security, indoor cameras aren\u2019t as obviously beneficial. They certainly feel creepier.", "description": "Technology allows us to do it.
