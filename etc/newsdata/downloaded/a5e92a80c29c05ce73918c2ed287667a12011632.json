Crops have also been destroyed.\n\n\"Our people must benefit, this is a resource we think we can monetise, Farawo said.\n\n\"That's why we have been saying we believe that the elephants must pay for their upkeep.\"\n\nBotswana's environment minister Mokaila said detractors need to consider that rural communities were being affected by increasing wildlife numbers, climate change, water shortages and loss of land fertility.\n\n\"It's not just about talking about elephants or rhino, it's about talking about economies in Southern Africa,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot be emotional about it. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and think that the problem will solve itself by saying stop trade,\" said Mokaila.", "description": "Southern African nations are threatening to quit the global wildlife trade regulator after it refused to relax restrictions on trade in ivory and rhino horn and imposed a near total ban on zoos taking African elephants captured in the wild.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2773/12f4d0d5f8104f6f873c9f6ba4830d90.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
