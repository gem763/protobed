Additionally he was ordered to perform 120 hours of community service with a W10 million fine (US$1=W1,172).\n\nGolfer Kim Bi-o was handed a one-year suspension for raising his middle finger to the gallery at a tournament in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province last month.\n\nAnnoyed by the sound of cellphone cameras going off at the tournament on Sept. 29, Kim flipped off the gallery and slammed his golf club into the ground.\n\nHe won the tournament and apologized after the win, but criticism mounted as his outburst was broadcast live on TV.\n\nBut some fans defended him, saying taking pictures during a swing is not acceptable as it would disturb a player, and the penalty was too harsh.\n\nThe association said Kim regretted what he did and felt sorry for his \"inappropriate\" behavior.\n\nKim will be able to compete again starting in 2021.", "description": "Bird-Flipping Golfer Kim Bi-o Gets Reduced Suspension", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/24/2019102401520_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
