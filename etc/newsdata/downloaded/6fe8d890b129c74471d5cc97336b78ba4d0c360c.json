But Trump\u2019s lawyers point once more to a Justice Department opinion that presidents cannot be indicted.\n\nTrump\u2019s Ukraine call reveals a president convinced of his own invincibility\n\nTrump has said he did nothing wrong on the call. But the administration has refused to turn over to Congress details of the whistleblower complaint that brought the alleged offer to light. On Sunday, in a letter to lawmakers in both parties, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused the administration of \u201centering a grave new chapter of lawlessness.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters argue \u2014 and many of Trump\u2019s opponents concede \u2014 that conflicts such as this are more political than legal, and that the Ukraine matter doesn\u2019t seem to have shifted public opinion or broken Washington\u2019s stalemate any more than special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election did.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything more alarming here than what we see from this president 10 times a week,\u201d said Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa. He noted that \u201cno president has ever been prosecuted for anything.\u201d\n\nTrump \u201ctweets this stuff out all the time: \u2018Investigate my enemies.\u2019 I don\u2019t see this moving the needle at all,\u201d Grewal said. \u201cIf he\u2019d just tweeted this out instead of making the call, we\u2019d shrug and say, \u2018More of the same.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA president who relishes provocation, an outsider who got elected in large part because he promised to disrupt and upend a system that relies on laws and regulations to curb excesses, Trump has throughout his life believed that laws are pesky obstacles that sometimes need to be pushed aside to get things done.\n\nTrump suggests he mentioned Biden in phone call with Ukrainian president\n\nStarting with his first confrontation with federal prosecutors, in a 1973 case in which he and his father were accused of discriminating against black and Hispanic renters seeking apartments in their New York City developments, Trump has viewed the law as an impediment to profit and progress, Barbara Res, an early top executive in Trump\u2019s real estate business, said in an interview earlier this year.\n\n\u201cHe ignores the law when he doesn\u2019t like it, he uses the law to get his way,\u201d Res said. \u201cHe sees it as a weapon to use to get what he wants.\u201d\n\nNow, almost half a century later after his first legal battle, Trump\u2019s time as president is confronting the nation with a basic question about the American political system: Does this president\u2019s skepticism about the law and improvisational method of governing confound the checks the Constitution provided to rein in a president\u2019s power?\n\nIf a crime was committed in the Ukraine matter, legal scholars say, it may have been a violation of laws that prohibit bribery, bar Americans from seeking to influence foreign officials and ban foreign involvement in U.S. election campaigns.\n\nBecause the law defines bribery as the giving or taking of a thing of value for the purpose of influencing an official\u2019s actions, \u201cthe issue would be whether the promise to investigate [Biden\u2019s son] Hunter Biden was a thing of value that was offered and accepted,\u201d Grewal said. \u201cSome people will say it\u2019s an intangible with no obvious value, and others will say it\u2019s evidently a thing of value to kneecap your opponent.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller report got hung up on what exactly constitutes a thing of value, concluding in its discussion of a Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer that, as Grewal summarized it, \u201cit was debatable whether the dirt on [Democratic opponent] Hillary Clinton was a thing of value.\u201d\n\nBut in that instance, \u201cTrump wasn\u2019t yet the president,\u201d said Washington lawyer Eric L. Lewis, a partner at Lewis Baach who specializes in international fraud and corruption cases. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening, dig up some dirt on the Clinton emails.\u2019 In this case, the question is: Is investigating your opponent and thereby increasing your chances to win the election a thing of value? People have gone to jail for less.\u201d\n\nLewis said any promise Trump may have made to the Ukrainian president could be investigated as a \u201cbreach of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He\u2019s a U.S. person offering something to a foreign person for personal advantage, and that\u2019s what the law prohibits.\u201d\n\nBut whatever laws may be involved in any inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions, the fact that prosecutors would not file charges against a sitting president makes this more a political question than a legal one.\n\n\u201cThe framers were unwise to give the president such a huge amount of power in foreign affairs,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cbut they were wise to have a remedy in the legislative branch\u201d \u2014 Congress\u2019s ability to impeach and remove a president who criminally abuses power.\n\nSome scholars say the U.S. political system has demonstrated its effectiveness already in this case because an unnamed intelligence official felt confident enough in the federal protections for whistleblowers to raise the alarm about Trump\u2019s alleged promise.\n\n\u201cIn one sense, the system has already worked here because we know about the call thanks to the whistleblower statute,\u201d Grewal said.\n\nThe call and Trump\u2019s alleged promise have unleashed a torrent of outrage from Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans arguing that the president\u2019s disregard for the rules of the road is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cPutting the impeachment question aside, the national security implications of a President asking a foreign power to investigate an American citizen for the president\u2019s own political benefit [are] unprecedented,\u201d tweeted Kelly Magsamen, a Pentagon official in the Obama administration and now vice president for national security at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning Washington think tank. \u201cAnd it can induce other foreign powers to do similar to curry favor.\u201d\n\nBut in some ways, the country has been here before.\n\n\u201cWhen the president does it, that means it\u2019s not illegal,\u201d Richard Nixon said in a 1977 interview, three years after President Gerald Ford pardoned him for any crimes he might have committed as president.\n\nNixon went on to say that a president\u2019s power is not completely unchecked, but that the only really effective guardrail the system provides is the next election. \u201cSo that one does not get the impression that a president can run amok in this country and get away with it,\u201d he said, \u201cwe have to have in mind that a president has to come up before the electorate.\u201d\n\nNixon resigned from the presidency as his popular support collapsed and at the cusp of what appeared to be certain impeachment by the House and likely conviction by the Senate. \u201cI have impeached myself,\u201d Nixon would say later.\n\nEarlier this summer, when Nixon\u2019s White House counsel, John Dean, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to talk about the Mueller investigation, he warned that \u201chistory is repeating itself, and with a vengeance.\u201d\n\nBut Trump at this point faces none of the threats that Nixon ran up against in his final months in office. Trump\u2019s support in opinion polls has remained rock-steady, although always short of majority approval, and his Republican support in Congress is still nearly monolithic.\n\n\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s invincible, and he\u2019s probably right,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nIn his 1977 interview with David Frost, Nixon maintained that \u201ctechnically, I did not commit a crime, an impeachable offense,\u201d but he also conceded that \u201cthese are legalisms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI let down the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government but will think it is all too corrupt.\u201d\n\nWhen Nixon resigned, Trump was a young man making his way into the Manhattan real estate business. Trump told The Washington Post\u2019s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in 2016 that Nixon was a \u201cgreat talent\u201d who \u201cfailed . . . because of his personality. Very severe, very exclusive.\u201d\n\nTrump has dismissed comparisons of his presidency with Nixon\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe left. I don\u2019t leave. A big difference,\u201d Trump said in June. \u201cI don\u2019t leave.\u201d", "description": "Whatever happened between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, legal experts say, it\u2019s likely to be judged in the next election, not in court", "authors": ["Marc Fisher", "Senior Editor Reporting On A Wide Range Of Topics"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SLT2C5W5QEI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
