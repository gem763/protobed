General Assembly speech Wednesday, accusing neighboring dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of aiding drug traffickers, terrorists, \u201cmurderers, and child rapists.\u201d\n\nDuque compared Maduro to genocidal Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and announced he would hand over a dossier of evidence to the head of the General Assembly proving that Maduro is harboring Marxist terrorists belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) that are engaged in an ongoing war against the Colombian government.\n\nEntregamos a #ONU pruebas de complicidad de Nicol\u00e1s Maduro con terroristas que atentan contra pueblo colombiano. Presentamos a cerca de 20 criminales que traicionaron generosidad de Colombia y est\u00e1n en Venezuela.

Given the existence of the deal, he noted, \u201cthese groups have not enjoyed the fruits of reintegration or disarmament simply because they chose not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cA group of narco-terrorists sought to intimidate Colombia hiding behind claims of ideological goals, but the reality is that these groups have not enjoyed the fruits of reintegration or disarmament because they simply chose not to,\u201d Duque told the General Assembly. \u201cThey have not left behind their life of crime, they have lied to Colombia and Colombians, and they have aligned themselves with a dictatorship that is repressing its people in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe terrorists have \u201cfound themselves resisted by a people that will not be cowered \u2026. let there be no room for doubt, I will use all tools available to me so that Colombia enjoys peace,\u201d Duque warned the terrorists.\n\nDuque appeared to be addressing two main FARC terror leaders directly, \u201cJes\u00fas Santrich\u201d and \u201cIv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez,\u201d who the Colombian government gave Senate seats to before they defected to Venezuela and announced a new civil war against Bogot\u00e1. Maduro and his cronies have insisted they have \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the FARC war, but Duque insisted otherwise on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Venezuelan dictatorship is one more link in the chain of transnational terrorism. Its corrupt structures are the handmaidens of drug cartels,\u201d Duque affirmed. \u201cIts followers are adherents of a mafia and fuel the violence in Colombia. The dictatorship gives refuge to murderers and child rapists \u2013 and those who ignore these facts are, by their silence, accomplices of the dictatorship.\u201d\n\nThe FARC is over a century old and has for nearly just as much time been guilty of abducting children to use as soldiers. Girls forced into terrorism often fall prey to rapist terrorists, and are later forced into unwanted abortions to keep from slowing down terror cells with babies. One FARC abortionist arrested was believed to be responsible for as many as 500 murders of unborn children.\n\n\u201cMy government has credible and resounding proof that corroborates the support lent by the Venezuelan dictatorship to criminal and drug trafficking groups that are operating in Venezuela and assume activities in Colombia as a assault on our nationhood,\u201d Duque said, displaying a thick dossier that he promised to hand over to the president of the General Assembly.\n\nDuque also addressed the damage that Maduro has done to his own country, not just Colombia.\n\n\u201cSince 2015, at least 4.2 million people have fled Venezuela. They flee from a nation that was wealthy and is now in the abyss, that cannot feed its people,\u201d the Colombian president said. \u201cThat was a flourishing democracy and is now an authoritarian regime that is now without a free media \u2026 its citizens have no choice but to jump ship.\u201d\n\nDuque affirmed that Colombia does not recognize Maduro\u2019s legitimacy, but that of constitutionally appointed interim President Juan Guaid\u00f3, along with over 50 other nations, most in Latin America.\n\n\u201cWe adopt this stance driven by the need we see for the Venezuelan people to have their democracy restored,\u201d Duque said. \u201cThe Venezuelan tragedy has a name and we all know what that name is.\u201d\n\nDuque said that Maduro\u2019s human rights abuses \u201ccan be justifiably compared to the crimes of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia,\u201d who was tried before an international tribunal for genocide following a vicious campaign to eradicate non-Serbian people from Bosnia.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit by idly watching,\u201d Duque urged. \u201cVenezuela needs the urgent convening of genuinely free and fair elections and it needs the full restoration of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque urged his fellow heads of state to \"resist tyranny\" in his U.N.
