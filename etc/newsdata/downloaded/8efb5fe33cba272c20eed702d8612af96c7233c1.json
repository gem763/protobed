She told judges on Thursday that the term mutilation is \"offensive\" and denigrates the cultural significance of the practice.\n\n\"Women who took their daughters for circumcision were not taking them there to destroy them. Those children were not thrown away afterward, they were celebrated as respected members of the society. To use the word in our context suggests that it is malicious and that we are intentionally damaging our females. To me, it is very wrong,\" Kamau said\n\nShe is pushing for medical workers and \"certified\" traditional cutters to be allowed to circumcise women.\n\n\"We could have had limitations of where you can do it, when, who can do it for you and how ...Those things could have been controlled ... such that you have certain months of the year and that is the only time you can do and it can only be done by certain professionals, those are the only people who are allowed to do it,\" Kamau said.\n\nKamau declined to comment to CNN until the case is over.\n\nViolation of women and girl's rights\n\nFGM is illegal for both women and girls in Kenya, and individuals involved in the practice could spend three years in jail even if it's done outside its border.\n\nDespite the law, many women are undergoing the cut in rural Kenya where cultural and traditional beliefs persist that FGM \u2014 the partial removal of the external female genitalia such as the clitoris or labia \u2014 reduces a woman's desire for sex.\n\nFGM, internationally recognized as a violation of the human rights of women and girls, can cause severe bleeding and other health issues, infections, infertility and complications in childbirth, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAnti-FGM campaigners have described Kamau's position as \"outrageous\" saying arguments to overturn the act erodes progress that has been made in the fight for women and girl's rights in Kenya.\n\n\"It's outrageous that a supposed doctor, who should be protecting Kenyan women and girls, is trying to put them in harm's way. Her comments suggest that she doesn't seem to understand basic medicine,\" said Brendan Wynne from the Five Foundation, a global partnership to end FGM.\n\n\"FGM causes lifelong damage and can kill. Let's not roll back progress at a point when Kenya is finally starting to see some traction on this issue.\"\n\nKamau's petition has been adjourned until December.", "description": "A female doctor in Kenya wants female genital mutilation to be decriminalized.", "authors": ["Bukola Adebayo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025143955-01-tatu-kamau-1024-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
