Both stories were based on quotes from one parent and one police officer who were concerned about CBD candy packaging, rather than any evidence that any children had received some CBD snacks while going door-to-door.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s one big reason kids don't get CBD candies: they're a lot more expensive than a bag of M&Ms! If I\u2019m shelling out $40 for CBD gummies, I am not sharing them with random children \u2014 my friends will be lucky if they get a single piece.\n\n\n\nSo no, kids aren\u2019t getting CBD candies while they\u2019re out trick-or-treating, and you definitely shouldn\u2019t give them any. But what if you want some CBD candies for your own personal Halloween treat?\n\n\n\nOver the past few years, more and more CBD candies and chocolates have arrived on the market. In case you didn't know, CBD is short for cannabidiol. It\u2019s one of many compounds found in cannabis, and unlike tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, it doesn\u2019t get you high. It\u2019s non-intoxicating, even at concentrations beyond what most people would actually take.\n\n\n\nSo far, the potential health benefits of CBD are mostly unproven: the FDA has approved a drug containing a form of CBD to treat epilepsy, and hasn\u2019t yet weighed in on any other potential benefits. Some studies have shown promising results for treating anxiety and stress , for example, but more research is still needed. However, millions of consumers use CBD products to self-treat anxiety, ADHD, migraines, insomnia, endometriosis, and more.\n\n\n\nAnd while you can take CBD as a tincture or capsule, taking asa gummy or chocolate can be a little bit tastier.
