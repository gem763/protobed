If I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing,\u201d he said, The New York Times reported.\n\nMr. de Blasio entered the 2020 presidential race on May 16 with an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d which multiple groups including a police advocacy group and Black Lives Matter protested. That same month, Mr. de Blasio reportedly only worked for seven hours on New York City-related matters.\n\nSince then, the mayor has struggled to break out in the crowded Democratic field. He\u2019s consistently polled at 0% to 1% and failed to qualify for the September debate in Houston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have eyes to see,\u201d he said. \u201cNot making September, of course, that\u2019s disappointing. And so, my view was, there\u2019s still one good chance to do that. I\u2019m going to see what I can do there and see if I can break through.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cgood chance\u201d is getting slimmer by the day, as campaign filings show Mr. de Blasio has only 6,600 of the 130,000 unique donors needed to make the debate stage.\n\nA fellow New York candidate, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, raised more money than Mr. de Blasio but ended her campaign late last month after she didn\u2019t qualify for the September debates, either.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know when it\u2019s not your time,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in a video announcing her departure.\n\nHowever, the mayor said Wednesday there\u2019s still time to make up ground.\n\n\u201cPeople go from unheard-of to totally famous in 72 hours in America now,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cA candidate like me who is not that well-known yet, ask me in 72 hours, right, and something might change.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
