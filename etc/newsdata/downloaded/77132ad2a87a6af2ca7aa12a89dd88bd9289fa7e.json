He said he had contact with two other incels who committed mass killings. Asked how he felt about those that he killed and injured, he said \u201cI feel like I accomplished my mission.\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know whether he would apologize to the families of the victims.\n\nEight women and two men ranging in age from 22 to 94 were killed in the April 2018 attack, the deadliest act of mass murder in the city\u2019s history. Minassian, 26, has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 of attempted murder.\n\nMinassian\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on the release of the video and transcript Friday. Toronto attorney Boris Bytensky said his \u201cviews about the statement will be expressed inside the courtroom at the appropriate time.\u201d Minassian\u2019s judge-only trial is scheduled to start in February.\n\n[Suspect in Toronto van rampage charged with 10 murder counts, but motive remains unclear]\n\n\n\nSuspected Toronto van attacker Alek Minassian, top, is seen during a police interview in a still frame taken from handout video footage. (AP/AP)\n\nThe video and a 190-page transcript of the police interview were made public on Friday after an Ontario judge lifted a publication ban. The materials provide a glimpse into his path to radicalization, the online forums where misogynistic violence flourishes and his motives.\n\nMinassian told police he had a normal childhood and a good relationship with his parents and brother, but he never had a girlfriend and his interactions with women left him angry.\n\nHe spoke of a Halloween party in 2013. He said he tried to speak to women, but they rebuffed him, giving their \u201clove and affection to obnoxious brutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider myself a supreme gentleman,\u201d he told police.\n\nMinassian said a friend from Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology introduced him to online discussion boards including the 4Chan board R9K and the subreddit ForeverAlone. He also joined the subreddit POL, where he said the \u201cgeneral topic is basically political discussions with an alt-right bias.\u201d\n\n\n\nDefense lawyer Boris Bytensky, Justice Ruby Wong, Minassian (by video) and Crown prosecutor Joe Callaghan appear in court in May 2010.

He said he was attracted to the \u201cblunt and honest\u201d conversational style of the online forums, and accused other incels of being \u201ctoo cowardly to act on their anger.\u201d\n\nMinassian told police he had contact with Chris Harper-Mercer and Elliot Rodger, two other incels who had committed mass killings, but those claims have not been verified.\n\nHarper-Mercer shot and killed a teacher, eight students and himself at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015. Rodger killed six people and himself in Santa Barbara, Calif., in 2014.\n\n[How do you capture a mass-killer suspect without firing a shot? Ask Toronto police.]\n\nMinassian told police he began to feel \u201cradicalized\u201d after the Santa Barbara killings. Rodger left an extensive digital history, including a YouTube video in which he vowed a \u201cday of retribution\u201d against \u201cevery single spoiled, stuck-up blonde\u201d woman who had rejected him.\n\n\u201cI felt it was time to take action and not just sit on the sidelines and just fester in my own sadness,\u201d Minassian told police.\n\nDays before the Toronto attack, he wrote in a post on 4Chan that there would be a \u201cbeta uprising\u201d and encouraged others to follow suit. On the day of the attack, he wrote on Facebook that \u201cthe incel rebellion has begun.\u201d\n\nThe April attack, which rattled one of North America\u2019s safest cities, was stopped only when someone\u2019s drink splashed onto the van\u2019s windshield, Minassian said.\n\nMinassian told police he pointed his wallet at an officer \u201cwith the intent for it to be confused as a gun so that I could be fatally shot.\u201d In footage of his arrest, Minassian says to \u201cshoot me in the head,\u201d but Constable Ken Lam declines.\n\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service said last year it was \u201cincreasingly preoccupied\u201d by the threat posed by right-wing extremism, which encompassed \u201cmisogynist violence.\u201d\n\nIt cited the Toronto attack, saying it was motivated \u201cin whole or in part\u201d by right-wing extremism, and noted that many perpetrators \u201cfind inspiration from international terrorist attacks and adopt similar low-sophistication tactics,\u201d including vehicle ramming.\n\nThe judge who lifted the publication ban said Minassian\u2019s mental state will be a focus of his trial.\n\nRead more:\n\nCanadian trauma surgeons called for gun control.
