'He attacked me several times and was convicted three times for assault, but I always went back.\n\n'He told me what to wear and how to behave. If we didn't have sex every day, he would accuse me of cheating on him.'\n\nLooking back, Laura admitted she cannot believe the way McKinlay 'controlled' her and made her 'so miserable'.\n\nLaura told how, after she told McKinlay she needed to go to hospital because she was in labour with their second child (pictured after the birth) he sent her on a big shopping trip to Iceland while he mucked around with his golf clubs\n\nWhen the couple finally got to the hospital - at which point Laura was 7cm dilated - McKinlay shouted at her for taking so long to give birth\n\nLaura met abusive McKinlay, who is 11 years her senior, at the age of 17, and claimed he immediately became controlling and persuasive.\n\n'I bumped into him a few times in the corner shop,' she recalled. 'He was very attractive, he worked out a lot. He was much older and so I looked up to him \u2013 I did as he said.'\n\nTwo weeks after their relationship started, Laura said McKinlay got a tattoo of her name on his chest, and asked her to move in with him.\n\n'I was very young, and I felt flattered,' she admitted. '[But] he was very intense. He would insist on sitting next to me all the time on the couch, I wasn't even allowed to sit on my own.\n\n'He didn't like me going anywhere without him. I couldn't send a text without him checking it first.\n\nLaura met McKinlay at their corner shop when she was 17 years old - he was 11 years older, which meant she idolised him\n\nSpeaking about their relationship, Laura said she was forced to have sex with McKinlay at least once a day and always had to sit next to him on the sofa\n\n'We had to have sex daily \u2013 sometimes twice a day \u2013 or he'd accuse me of cheating. It was draining, physically and emotionally.'\n\nIn July 2010, McKinlay was jailed for six months for assaulting Laura. But after he pleaded for forgiveness, she took him back.\n\nIn May 2011, Laura gave birth to their first daughter. Struggling to cope afterwards, Laura went on the pill - until McKinlay found out and put a stop to it.\n\nShe explained: 'I didn't want any more children with him, I was making plans to get away.\n\n'But he went crazy when he found out I was taking contraception because he wanted me to have loads of kids so he could control me. I had to take it \u2013 I had no choice.'\n\nLaura had a second daughter in June 2012 - but not before she was ordered to go to Iceland supermarket by McKinlay despite explaining she had gone into labour.\n\nLaura, pictured here with McKinlay, took him back on three occasions - each time after he was convicted of assaulting her\n\n'I had a check-up with my midwife, and she said my labour was starting and to pack my bag and get to the hospital,' Laura explained.\n\n'I cleaned the house, got my sister to look after my daughter, and asked Jamie to take me to hospital.\n\n'But he refused because we had no food in. He made me do a big shop at Iceland and by the time I had finished \u2013 and put the shopping away \u2013 I was in agony.\n\n'He was sorting out his golf clubs, like there was no problem. I got to hospital and I was already 7cm dilated. Jamie started shouting, \"It doesn't take anyone else this long to give birth,\" and he stormed off the labour ward.\n\n'Twenty minutes later, our daughter was born.'\n\nThe final straw in their relationship came when McKinlay, pictured, was sentenced to two years in prison after he broke a restraining order\n\nThat same year in December, McKinlay was handed a two-year suspended sentence for assault - but yet again, Laura took him back.\n\n'I was infatuated with him,' she said. 'And I had got to the stage where I felt I couldn't cope without him. He made me feel that I needed him.'\n\nIn May 2014, McKinlay served 20 weeks on remand for assault. Laura welcomed their third child, a boy, the following year.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Laura finally found the strength to walk away for good. McKinlay was sentenced to two years in jail for breach of a restraining order the following year.\n\nLaura has since found love with new partner Dean Grogan, pictured, and the pair have a two-year-old son and baby daughter together, alongside her two daughters and son from her previous relationship with McKinlay\n\nDuring the hearing at Preston Crown Court, the judge slammed McKinlay for being 'utterly controlling' and said Laura was 'immensely vulnerable'.\n\n'He had her over a barrel and could do whatever he wanted,' the judge said.\n\nThe court heard McKinlay had a staggering 46 offences on his record, including a number for violence and harassment.\n\nLaura said: 'That was the end for me. I found the strength to stand up to him, for my sake and for my children.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Laura Wallis, 26, from Lancashire, has revealed how her abusive ex-partner Jamie McKinlay sent her to Iceland while she was in labour - but feels free now he has been put behind bars.", "authors": ["Ann Cusack For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/08/20118804-0-image-a-15_1571901345774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
