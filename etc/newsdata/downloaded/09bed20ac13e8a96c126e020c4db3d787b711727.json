According to The Hollywood Reporter, slender Hollywood viking Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd is in talks to star in and produce The Northman, which is a drama about actual Vikings, specifically one who sets out to avenge the death of his father. To make it all even more appropriately Nordic and fair, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd are all also classified as in talks for the film, along with Eggers\u2019s Lighthouse star Willem Dafoe. (Taylor-Joy, of course, broke out thanks to the director\u2019s feature debut, The Witch.)\n\nThe filmmaker is said to be writing the script with, wait for it, the Icelandic poet and novelist Sj\u00f3n, and the story will take place at the turn of the 10th century. If all the negotiations come through, Alexander would play the vengeful Viking prince and Kidman would play his mom, since she has reached the \u201cmother of royalty\u201d stage of her career. It sounds very dramatic and beautiful and as white as the driven snow during a Swedish winter.", "description": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd to star in and produce the viking drama The Northman from director Robert Eggers, which will also feature Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Willem Dafoe.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/06/30/30-alexander-skarsgard.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
