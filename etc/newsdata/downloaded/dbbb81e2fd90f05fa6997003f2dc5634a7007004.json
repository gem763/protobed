Johnson says the backstop \u2014 which was negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May and is designed to avoid the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland \u2014 is the biggest obstacle to achieving a negotiated departure of Britain from the United Kingdom.\n\n\"I said to Prime Minister Johnson that I had no emotional attachment to the safety net, to the backstop,\" Juncker said, recounting their lunch meeting in Luxembourg. \"But I stated that I stand by the objectives it is designed to achieve, and that is why I called on the prime minister to come forward with operational proposals in writing for practical steps that would allow us to achieve those objectives.\"\n\n\"Now until such time as those proposals have been presented I will not be able to tell you, looking you in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved,\" Juncker said.\n\nIt was a flat rejection of Johnson's repeated assertions that the two sides have made \"significant progress\" toward resolving what has so far been an intractable deadlock.\n\n\"The prime minister assured us that he continued to want an agreement, but whatever happens the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on the 31st of October, with or without an agreement.\" \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker\n\nJuncker's message was reiterated moments later by the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who added a pointed warning that a no-deal Brexit would be no escape for the U.K. from the thorniest issues in the talks so far. Barnier, noting the U.K. relies on the EU27 for half of its trade, said that any future trade agreement would hinge on Britain first resolving the major divorce issues with the EU including its financial obligations and safeguarding citizens' rights.\n\n\"If the U.K. leaves without a deal,\" Barnier told the MEPs \"I would recall that these questions don't just disappear.\"\n\nJuncker said the EU27 ultimately would be a victim to the political whims of Westminster, and that Johnson at their lunch on Monday had repeated his oft-stated vow that Britain would depart on the October 31 deadline. He said that would happen with or without a negotiated settlement, despite a law passed by the British parliament declaring that his government must request an extension if a deal has not been reached in time.\n\n\"At the moment it is not Britain that is leaving the EU, but jobs and business that is leaving the U.K.\" \u2014 Manfred Weber\n\n\"The prime minister assured us that he continued to want an agreement, but whatever happens the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on the 31st of October, with or without an agreement, \" Juncker said. \"That is why the risk of a no deal is palpable.\"\n\n\"The risk of a no deal remains very real and basically is going to come down to a decision by the United Kingdom government that would never be a preferred option of the European Union,\" he added.\n\nDespite the lack of progress, Juncker called recent talks \"friendly, constructive and in part positive\" and said, \"the Commission is prepared to work day in, day out ... to find the technical and political solutions we need.\"\n\n\"I am not sure we'll get there,\" he said. \"There is very little time remaining.\"\n\nJuncker and Barnier spoke in the debate ahead of a vote on a resolution effectively declaring that a no-deal Brexit would be Britain's fault and reiterating the European Parliament's main positions on the U.K.'s departure. While the vote is largely symbolic, it is also a reminder that any withdrawal deal with the U.K. must be ratified by MEPs as well as by the British parliament, creating yet another hurdle to complete an agreement within the short window of time before the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nGerman MEP Manfred Weber, the leader of the conservative European People's Party group, used his remarks to criticize the U.K. over its handling of Brexit.\n\n\"At the moment it is not Britain that is leaving the EU, but jobs and business that is leaving the U.K.,\" Weber said in English, as pro-Brexit MEPs groaned loudly in anger.\n\nWeber, who was his party's lead candidate for Commission president in the spring European Parliament elections, said the Brexit mess had served as a useful talking point.\n\n\"Mainly we regret here in the plenary the Brexit outcome,\" Weber said. \"But I must tell you during the election campaign it was a powerful argument to tell the Europeans it's stupid and it creates a lot of uncertainty if you take the European Union into question.\"", "description": "\u2018I am not sure we\u2019ll get there,\u2019 said the European Commission president.", "authors": ["Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "David M.
