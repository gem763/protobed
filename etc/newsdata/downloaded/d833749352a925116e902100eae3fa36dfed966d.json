So far their favourite match has been Japan\u2019s gripping win over Ireland, not least for the Brave Blossoms\u2019 esprit de corps and positivity. If Philippe Chauvin\u2019s middle son, Nicolas, had still been alive they felt he would have loved it, too.\n\nIt is almost 10 months now since Nicolas, aged 18, died while playing for Stade Fran\u00e7ais Espoirs against their counterparts from Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles. Rugby was his passion from the moment he first picked up a ball at his local club just east of Paris in 2005. Tragically, the young flanker\u2019s choice of sport cost him his life.\n\nFrance facing up to clamour for rugby to change after spate of tragedies | Andy Bull Read more\n\nA double tackle fractured a cervical vertebra and he subsequently suffered a heart attack and brain damage. He underwent emergency surgery but died three days later.\n\nNot everyone, in the wake of such a grievous loss, would have the emotional resilience to tune into this World Cup. Philippe Chauvin, however, is a remarkable \u2013 and increasingly driven \u2013 man. Having played rugby himself for 25 years, he wants Nicolas\u2019s death to galvanise the game\u2019s authorities, in France and worldwide. At the end of last month he announced his intention to launch a manslaughter lawsuit aimed at uncovering the full facts behind his son\u2019s death.\n\nChauvin, who works for the French national rail company SNCF, feels he owes it to Nicolas to check out every available avenue. Under French law, with the police investigation now closed, he is not allowed access to the file relating to his son\u2019s death unless he goes down the legal route. \u201cLosing a child is terrible, even more so because of a problem that could have been avoided. I\u2019m going ahead with this complaint because I do not want it to happen to others.\n\n\u201cI feel it is also my duty to Nicolas to do everything so that the facts and responsibilities are established. By filing a complaint, I will have access to the file. There may be things that I do not know or positions that are not the ones I was told.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Philippe Chauvin speaks at the Paris Descartes University.

I do not believe that a shoulder shot to the head launched at 20 km/h preserves safety. I just want someone to explain to me why the security of a player could not be assured and if and where mistakes were made.\u201d\n\nCalm and measured, Chauvin could just be the catalyst for significant change, with four young players having died in French rugby between May 2018 and January this year. The upper age limit for players representing the Espoirs has already been reduced by a year to 22, aiming to reduce the \u2018men against boys\u2019 element when young junior-club hopefuls like Nicolas start colliding with intensively conditioned professionals. Below-the-waist-only tackles and a ban on double tackles are being tried out at junior level, albeit with mixed initial results.\n\nThe Chauvin family, though, believe it is people\u2019s attitudes that most need recalibrating. \u201cRugby is not a game of destruction, we must not play to wipe out an opponent. The spirit of the game is to keep the ball alive, not to kill your opposite number.\u201d\n\nFrench rugby authorities call for lower tackle height after players\u2019 deaths Read more\n\nWhile Philippe instinctively remains a rugby man \u2013 \u201cI used to watch the games with Nicolas. It\u2019s part of our life. I do not wish to attack rugby\u201d \u2013 he does not want other parents to suffer as he and his wife have done.\n\nIn particular, he argues the sport cannot continue to permit the type of fierce upper-body shot that fractured Nicolas\u2019s second vertebra \u2013 an injury more consistent with car crash victims. \u201cWe must stop looking for excuses when an offence is committed. Rugby is a beautiful sport in terms of its values and shared commitment but if the game is not controlled and safety is not assured, young people will go to another sport. It should not be a sport for bullies or brutes but a sport of possibilities, in which teams have to combine strength, speed, agility, intelligence and will.\u201d\n\nThe past 10 months have also shown him and his two other rugby-playing sons \u2013 the eldest is 20 \u2013 that not everyone takes full responsibility for their actions. \u201cI have discovered that some within the sport are not prepared to face the reality of fatal accidents. I was very surprised given it is a professional sport. In business a fatal accident is the responsibility of the employer and investigations are conducted to establish the circumstances. The facts are examined against clear safety rules. I feel more apprehension for the players now and am much less tolerant of reckless play. I now know it can be fatal, that there is no second chance if the limits are crossed.\u201d\n\nThere are few things more affecting than a grieving parent\u2019s cry from the heart. Philippe Chauvin is looking forward to France\u2019s game against England on Saturday but his dearest wish is that Nicolas\u2019s story resonates far beyond this World Cup. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to leave a legacy, he just deserves the people of rugby to be aware of the truth.\u201d The entire rugby world should heed his powerful message.", "description": "Philippe Chauvin believes the death of his son Nicolas can be a catalyst for significant change in rugby\u2019s attitude to safety", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c089ec314869dffaa617a879ca63287f31670436/189_43_1084_650/master/1084.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f37b6fcbf1d7f7d0e25e5b0433fea219", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
