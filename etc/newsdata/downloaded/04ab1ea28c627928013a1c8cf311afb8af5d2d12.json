Or it could be Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who tried to make a joke about building a \u201cBlue Wall\u201d around President Trump happen.\n\nBut realistically, it could be someone entirely different.\n\nThat\u2019s the lure of the Polk County Steak Fry, one of the longest-standing political events in the influential caucus state. Sure, some attendees gathered here for hours on an overcast Saturday have already selected their candidates. But they\u2019re also actively sampling the biggest Democratic field in modern history. And for more than five hours, many were in no rush to choose just one.\n\nFrom recorded interviews to freewheeling sidebars, some Iowans\u2014including those wearing campaign garb promoting long-shot candidates\u2014mused that while they like said dark horses, they\u2019re likely to shift allegiances to candidates they feel have a better chance at securing the nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting to see a pretty big crowd,\u201d Dale Millizer, a 70-year-old Burlington resident supporting former Vice President Joe Biden, speculated about turnout on caucus night.\n\nBiden\u2019s showing in his past two presidential runs has been paltry. But his supporters here are adamant he\u2019ll pull through on caucus day in early February, with some even arguing the logistics of the grueling, hours-long process works in his benefit. So far, Biden has captured a sizable chunk of older loyalists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more for people that are retired,\u201d Beth De La Rosa, a Davenport resident who is also supporting Biden, said about the caucuses.\n\nOn Saturday, many of Biden\u2019s younger enthusiasts showed up in various capacities as volunteers, fellows, and organizers. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t reach out to the younger population,\u201d Everett Waechter, an 18-year-old supporter, reflected. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a worry for him.\u201d When approached for interviews, a few said they\u2019re not permitted to talk to the media.\n\nWaechter\u2019s candor, while directed at Biden, highlights a growing tension arising from an increased level of support for his closest rival in the field here: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has arguably the best ground game operation in Iowa, took the lead in a new Des Moines Register Iowa poll on Saturday night. For the first time in the Democratic nominating contest, Warren led both Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the poll.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s not even calling for impeachment yet,\u201d said Jessica Wiederspan, an Ankeney resident who is supporting Warren. \u201cI am shocked that really only Elizabeth Warren talked about it at the beginning of the speech. To me it\u2019s a national crisis.\u201d\n\nWarren, who now leads at 22 percent, with Biden following at 20 percent and Sanders at 11 percent, immediately started with an impassioned call to ramp up proceedings to systematically remove the president from office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here today to stand up for the constitution,\u201d Warren said. \u201cCongress failed to act and now Donald Trump has shown he is above the law.\u201d\n\nThat sense of push-pull\u2014the grassroots-oriented progressive fire from Warren versus a steady return-to-normalcy approach from Biden\u2014is at the heart of the current state of play here. Sanders, who has occupied the No. 2 spot in Iowa polls, has in recent weeks faced a series of staffing shake-ups that raise new questions about the direction of his campaign in the must-win state.\n\nBut candidates and supporters of rival campaigns believe the race is far from locked down here, with aides often noting the early and unpredictable nature of the race.\n\nSupporters of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who received loud cheers after joining a well-choreographed drum routine, were a visible presence at the event, signaling months of preparation. Harris bought some 1,000 tickets, organizers estimated, effectively guaranteeing she\u2019d have a strong showing. At any given moment, crowds of mustard yellow shirts emblazoned with \u201cKAMALA HARRIS FOR THE PEOPLE\u201d took up space.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys heard, I\u2019m planning on moving to Iowa!\u201d the California Democrat joked as she opened her speech to loud applause, echoing the rather more explicit \u2018I'm fucking moving to Iowa\u2019 line delivered to a Senate colleague.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is: You\u2019re going to be hearing from me a lot more!\u201d Will Dubbs, Harris\u2019 Iowa state director, wrote in a fundraising email titled \u201cSteak Fry\u201d on Sunday. In it, Dubbs detailed several of the campaign pledges Harris\u2019 team announced to reaffirm her commitment here, including hiring dozens of new organizers and physically showing up each week in October.\n\nPrior to Saturday\u2019s festival, Harris hadn\u2019t been in the state in over a month\u2014a source of some contention among Iowans who place a premium on retail politics.\n\n\u201cIf she wants to run in Iowa, run in Iowa,\u201d Rose Oster, a Des Moines resident deciding among several candidates but leaning toward Bullock, said.\n\nWhen asked by The Daily Beast what to make of Harris\u2019 new pledge to Iowa, some undecided voters remained skeptical.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s PR,\u201d Oster added. \u201cShe\u2019s saying this because she\u2019s been criticized for it.\u201d\n\nNick Maybanks, a lawyer from Cedar Rapids, echoed that sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m a prosecutor and I don\u2019t even know what her message is,\u201d he said. Maybanks, a politically active Democrat, says he was first excited about the prospect of Harris\u2019 candidacy when she made a trip to the state in October 2018.\n\nSharing the same umbrella legal profession as Harris once held, Maybanks has since taken a second look at Klobuchar, who is also a former prosecutor. He is also eyeing South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve personally been to a lot of events for several of the candidates and she\u2019s been notably absent,\u201d Maybanks said of Harris.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s campaign rallied a large activist base to Saturday\u2019s event, in what they hope is a glimpse into a strong final showing in the caucus. One vocal Buttigieg supporter said the campaign encouraged fans to come from out of state for the day\u2019s festivities.\n\nThe South Bend mayor is viewed favorably by 69 percent of respondents in the new Des Moines Register poll, second only to Warren, who came in at 75 percent. And as the field continues to narrow, Buttigieg took a recent swipe at Warren over the details of her health-care plan, saying during a cable news interview that she is \u201cknown for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question.\u201d\n\nStill, Buttigieg was hardly alone in jabbing the Democrat on the rise. Bullock, who appeared to have a larger showing of support at the event than what translates to poll numbers, seemed to entertain a mild critique of Warren.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t just put out plans for press releases, I actually have to get things done,\u201d he told reporters after manning a grilling station.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast if the word \u201cplans\u201d was a subtle dig at Warren, whose campaign slogan \u201cI have a plan\u201d has guided her progressive bid, Bullock demurred.\n\n\u201cNah, look,\u201d he started. \u201cThis comes down to math. If we can\u2019t connect with rural areas, we\u2019re just wasting our time.\u201d", "description": "They may be dallying with Klobuchar or Bullock, but some Iowans who talked to The Daily Beast say they\u2019re likely to switch to a candidate who can win\u2014like Biden or Warren.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2250,w_4000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569215308/190922-hannah-dems-iowa-embed-2_rcy7ef", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
