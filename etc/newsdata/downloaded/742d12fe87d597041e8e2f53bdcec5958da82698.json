The Washington Redskins\u2019 head coach is in his sixth year, and his team is 0-4. He has had just two winning seasons and made one playoff appearance. Gruden is toast, and in any professional sports organization, he would be toast.\n\nFor once, whenever owner Daniel Snyder chooses to fire Gruden \u2014 this week, bye week or any goodbye week \u2014 he actually will be making a standard NFL decision. The abnormal and disappointing part is the manner in which Washington arrived here. And the concern, if not the outright fear, is what lies on the other side of this inevitable firing.\n\nWhy is Gruden still here? You can ask that question in an accusatory tone, or you can ask it with reflective intentions. Let\u2019s ponder for a second.\n\nHis longevity, despite a 35-48-1 record, is a testament to his unique ability to hold this wacky franchise together. Since his hiring in January 2014, Gruden has been the glue for Washington. He has helped it aspire to be, and sometimes resemble, a functional outfit. On a rudimentary level, at least. Because of his easygoing personality and knack for moving on quickly from disappointment (losses or wonky front office decisions), he is a connector and quite good at minimizing a potential crisis. Those skills seem more like superpowers when navigating the toxic culture in Ashburn.\n\n[This wasn\u2019t about Jones vs. Haskins. It was a well-run NFL franchise vs. the Redskins.]\n\nGruden is still here because the ship hasn\u2019t sunk, despite the many reasons it should have, until now. Think about it. Scot McCloughan, who once seemed like a team-building savior, lasted two years. Brian Lafemina, who once seemed like a business operations savior, didn\u2019t last a full season. Three coordinators have tried and failed to fix the defense. Two quarterbacks believed to be the future, Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins, didn\u2019t pan out for vastly different reasons, but there was still hope until a third, Alex Smith, suffered a career-threatening broken leg. Oh, and Bruce Allen has been the team president the whole time.\n\nThere is even more to consider, but let\u2019s stop reading the list. Here\u2019s the larger point: Gruden has made it longer than anyone in Snyder\u2019s collection of head coaches because he managed to remain on task and keep dropping hints of progress even as dysfunction continued to swirl. Gruden is also fortunate that Snyder, after years of burdening the franchise with his impulsivity, has been in a patient mood. But the coach inspired that mood with his talent for managing up. Gruden made it work with Allen for as long as any human could. The few times Snyder interfered, Gruden resisted being offended. When Gruden messed up, he admitted his mistakes and evolved as a first-time NFL head coach. Quite often, Gruden made the Redskins feel like they could do something special. He was good for their ego. That\u2019s why he staved off joining Snyder\u2019s morgue of head coaches.\n\nGruden also showed glimpses of coaching brilliance, from his handling of quarterbacks to his stabilizing of the locker room during difficult situations. But ultimately, the bad stuff will define his tenure: the inconsistency, embarrassing losses in big games and continual resurfacing of a disturbing level of sloppiness in the Redskins\u2019 preparation and execution.\n\nGruden will pay for those coaching sins. And so be it. This is the nature of his profession. He has had enough time to produce better, but this looks to be his worst team. There aren\u2019t enough excuses to justify the poor results, even though the catastrophic injury to Smith and holdout of star left tackle Trent Williams are major factors. For those of us who have dealt with Gruden regularly, we respect that there\u2019s a decency to him that makes him enjoyable to work with daily. There also are a passion and a pragmatism to Gruden that remain admirable even at the end. When his time is over, he won\u2019t whine. He is unlikely to air any grievances. He will cite his record, acknowledge he was lucky to get a sixth season and move on with class.\n\nThere\u2019s no great failure in failing to revive this franchise. If Mike Shanahan and Joe Gibbs couldn\u2019t build a sustainable winner under Snyder, I\u2019m not certain who can. Snyder will keep getting in his own way. Allen \u2014 whose record as team president is 59-88-1, by the way \u2014 has become a mesmerizingly feckless top executive. He continues to destroy the organization\u2019s credibility and operate with a stunning lack of accountability, yet it seems like he holds more power than ever.\n\nThe eradication of Allen\u2019s influence is the most urgent and potentially transformative matter facing Washington. To Snyder, however, Allen is a confidant and a shield. So he stays, and instead of a significant front office overhaul, Gruden and the coaching staff will take the hit.\n\nThey will take it because Allen breathlessly declared the franchise is \u201cclose\u201d to realizing its dreams. I\u2019ve mocked that before and will do so again: Just because the Redskins hovered at .500 for Years 2-5 of Gruden, just because they were 6-3 last season before Smith went down, just because they\u2019ve drafted a few good young men, it doesn\u2019t mean that they are on the verge of perennial contention. That lie has been exposed the first month of the 2019 season.\n\n[Dwayne Haskins not assured of Redskins\u2019 starting job after rocky debut]\n\nNow, with so much uncertainty in the air, they must make a difficult choice at quarterback: Go back to Case Keenum, who was pulled in Sunday\u2019s loss to the New York Giants. Hand the lost season over to Dwayne Haskins, whose three interceptions in 17 passes against the Giants indicate he needs the slow and methodical development Gruden prefers. Or turn to Colt McCoy, who has a dubious history of injury misfortune.\n\nWhatever they decide, they\u2019ll do it in classic Redskins fashion, with limited input from a coach who has no future and maximum pressure from a front office that has no vision.\n\nNo one will be writing a book about Gruden\u2019s tenure. He could only lift the franchise to mediocrity, and at the end, even that work is being undone. Overall, it hasn\u2019t been impressive. Yet he was the only coach in Snyder\u2019s 20 seasons to post back-to-back winning seasons. Gruden and Gibbs are the only Snyder coaches to have two winning seasons during their tenure, period.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest Gruden\u2019s tenure represents close to the best that Washington can be with Snyder and Allen living in their aloof bubble. That sounds ludicrous at first, then sobering, then mortifying.\n\nA firing is supposed to be an opportunity to foster new hope. Good luck with that. The Redskins figure to dismiss Gruden soon, but the organizational stench shall remain.", "description": "Despite managing up well, Gruden will join a long list of coaches who couldn\u2019t succeed under Daniel Snyder and Bruce Allen.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist", "September At Am", "Jerry Brewer Is A Sports Columnist At The Washington Post.
