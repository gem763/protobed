Over the past few years, though, a new class of sea sprays have started popping up. Some are marketed as less crunchy and less drying than their predecessors, while others introduce new scents that are more floral \u2014 think lavender and rose \u2014 than the traditionally beachy, coconut-y scents of the wave sprays of yore. Some are meant to be used on dry hair, a step away from the traditional application of the spray to damp hair that you would then scrunch to your desired waviness. And some are even salt-free, in order to be less drying.\n\nWe wanted to try out some of these new sea sprays, and see if they really were so different from earlier sprays. And so the Great Sea-Spray Discussion of 2019 began: four writers, each with a different kind of hair, testing four sprays, and then getting together (on Google Hangouts, since three were in New York and one was in Los Angeles) to discuss each.\n\nThe testers and their hair types\n\nMarie Lodi: The top half of my shoulder-length hair is my \u201creal\u201d hair \u2014 super straight and fine with the tendency to get oily \u2014 while the bottom part, which is more textured and slightly wavy, is still recovering from two years of dyeing and bleaching. TL;DR: Straight and fine on the top, post-processing on the bottom.\n\nTanisha Pina: I have thick, 3C-type curls that for the most part are a mix of tight corkscrews and strands densely packed together. My hair is super prone to knots, loss of curl definition, and dryness \u2014 like, insatiably thirsty all of the time. TL;DR: Curly, thick, and prone to dryness.\n\nKelsi Trinidad: My natural hair is thick and leans oily with a texture that\u2019s between straight and wavy. I\u2019ve found that a couple of spritzes of sea-salt spray and a second\u2019s worth of scrunching is usually enough to make the transition to fully wavy hair. TL;DR: Thick, sometimes oily, and quick to wave.\n\nHilary Reid: My hair is pretty straight, flat, and medium-thick. It gets a little wavy in humidity, and I like to embrace that waviness as much as I can. Products tend to make my hair look dirty, so I use them sparingly. TL;DR: Straight-ish, fine, but lots of it.\n\nBest overall sea spray\n\nKristin Ess Soft Shine Beach Wave Spray We all loved Kristin Ess\u2019s Beach Wave Spray, which happened to be the least expensive spray and is meant to be used on dry hair. \u201cI actually used it on both wet and dry hair and got well-formed, consistent results waves-wise,\u201d says Kelsi Trinidad, who tested this on her long, thick hair, which easily holds waves. \u201cIt didn\u2019t weigh my hair down.\u201d Tanisha Pina says this worked well for her tight curls. \u201cIt really softened my hair at its driest \u2014 superlight and just feels like something I want to keep at my desk to bring my hair back to life when its shape inevitably fades mid-day.\u201d Marie Lodi, who tried this on her part-processed and part-grown out hair, says, \u201cIt worked for me and gave me some great waves and volume.\u201d And for me, Hilary, the spray gave volume to my straight hair, and didn\u2019t make it dry or crunchy. $14 at Target Buy\n\nThe one that gives volume to thick and fine hair\n\nHerbivore Botanicals Sea Mist Coconut + Sea Salt Beach Wave Hair Mist Herbivore\u2019s Sea Mist, which is infused with coconut and sea salt, was another crowd pleaser. \u201cI think this one was my favorite spray because it was so basic,\u201d says Trinidad. \u201cInstead of sticky, my hair remained light and voluminous. I liked that it wasn\u2019t crunchy in my hair like a lot of other salty ones are, a.k.a Bumble and Bumble.\u201d The Herbivore was one of my favorites, too \u2014 I found that it gave my hair good volume when it was dry. Pina, who also named this spray as a favorite, described how this helped give shape to her hair a few days after washing: \u201cMy day-three, four hair turns into a proper afro, so while I don\u2019t necessarily ever get \u2018beach waves\u2019 from any of these products, keeping my hair together in one unit \u2014 instead of having the hair on the top of my head sticking up and the hair on the bottom all over the place \u2014 is a big win for me.\u201d Lodi wasn\u2019t as crazy about this one, which left her straight and fine hair a little greasy. \u201cMy hair looks greasy after a day at the beach so at least it was accurate!\u201d she says. $20 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe one that gave big waves to fine hair\n\nAmika Bushwick Beach No-Salt Wave Spray \u201cI wanted to love it because I\u2019ve generally loved Amika\u2019s other products in the past but it made my curly hair feel really crunchy,\u201d says Pina. Trinidad, whose long hair is prone to oiliness, comments that \u201cIt made my hair oily and grimy and by the end of the day, my hair moved as one singular unit.\u201d This one wasn\u2019t a great fit for my hair, either: It initially added some waves, but by the end of the day my fine hair was flat again. Lodi, whose straight hair is recovering from processing at the bottom, but growing in fresh on the top, had better results. \u201cIt gave me the strongest waves (I almost felt like Baby in Dirty Dancing, except with more beach waves and not curls, but almost the same type of volume,)\u201d she says. \u201cBut when I applied it on damp hair it felt heavy and dried kind of matted.\u201d $25 at Sephora Buy\n\nThe floral-y one that\u2019s hydrating for curls\n\nFrench Girl Rose Sea Spray The light rose scent of this spray was a plus for all of us, as was the chic packaging. \u201cI actually really liked this one!\u201d says Pina, who calls the spray \u201creally lightweight\u201d and comments that it \u201cleft my thick, curly hair pretty defined even on my dryer strands at the bottom of my hair.\u201d Lodi found that this spray worked well on the still-processed part of her hair, while not having much of an effect on the fine hair at the top of her head. \u201cIt gave me nice, small waves without the volume,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it looked cool in that sense, like Californian girl natural waves.\u201d I had a similar experience to Lodi, and found that this worked best when I wanted to put my fine hair in a bun, but still have some texture. Trinidad said that for her thick and sometimes oily hair this one was \u201ca tad sticky, with less hold,\u201d leaving her \u201cin an odd place of kind-of-limp waves.\u201d $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
