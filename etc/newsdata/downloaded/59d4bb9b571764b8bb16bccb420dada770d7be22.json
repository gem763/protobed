Madrid said it was willing to be an intermediary in talks between the EU and the United States but if negotiations failed, it would call for the reactivation of tariffs from a 2004 WTO dispute won by the EU - which Spain says are worth more than 4 billion euros.\n\n\"If the US government rejects this offer of dialogue on the part of Spain and the European Union, the Spanish government will react immediately with strength and clarity to defend the interests of our citizens and companies,\" the government said.\n\nThe US ambassador to Spain could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nSpain estimates the new tariffs, which Washington said it would impose on products including wine and cheese, will affect about 1 billion euros of exports a year.\n\n\"It makes no sense that a conflict over the financing and construction of civilian airplanes degenerates into a broad commercial war against the agricultural sector that is neither good for European or US citizens,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIf the tariffs are confirmed, Spain said it would ask the European Commission to apply various measures to mitigate the impact on its agricultural sector.\n\nThe earlier complaint taken to the WTO by the EU was settled in 2006. It accused the United States of establishing special tax treatment for foreign sales corporations.", "description": "Spain has summoned the US ambassador in Madrid to express its complete rejection of any new US tariffs on European Union goods.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/80/52/1000x563_cmsv2_ecba3851-b357-5d5d-adff-2772b2d8586f-4208052.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
