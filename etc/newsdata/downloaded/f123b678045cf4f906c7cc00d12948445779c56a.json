This Time, It's Bulletproof.", "language": "en", "text": "Emmett Till\u2019s family stood on the shore of the Tallahatchie River just outside of Glendora, Mississippi, on Saturday. It was there, that, it is believed, the body of 14-year-old Emmett was pulled from the water after he had been kidnapped, tortured and lynched nearly 65 years ago.\n\nFor decades, the spot was unmarked, but in 2008, signs detailing Emmett\u2019s harrowing journey were installed around the region, and for the first time there was a memorial to the African-American teenager whose death galvanized the civil rights movement.\n\nBut the sign at the Tallahatchie River location was stolen and thrown into the river.\n\nA replacement was soon marred with bullet holes.\n\nThen came a third, which was hit with more bullets.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a fourth sign, this one made of steel. It weighs more than 500 pounds. It\u2019s over an inch thick, and, the manufacturer says, it\u2019s bulletproof.\n\nThe dedication of the new sign opened old wounds for his cousins, including Ollie Gordon, 71, and her daughter, Airickca Gordon-Taylor, 50. They traveled to Mississippi from Chicago, Emmett\u2019s hometown, for the ceremony.\n\n\u201cWhat they did to Emmett was so ugly that even the Tallahatchie River spewed his body back out so he could be seen and found,\u201d Gordon-Taylor said Sunday. She runs the Mamie Till Mobley Memorial Foundation, which is named in honor of Emmett\u2019s mother.\n\n\u201cVandalism is a hate crime,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically my family is still being confronted with a hate crime against Emmett Till and it\u2019s almost 65 years later.\u201d\n\nThe family has never healed from Emmett\u2019s murder, the mother and daughter said.\n\nGordon was 7 years old when her cousin was brutally killed after Carolyn Bryant Donham, a white woman, said the teenager had grabbed her and wolf-whistled at her. In 2017, she told a historian that her allegations against Emmett were false.\n\nGordon, who was raised in the same house as Emmett, remembers her cousin as a food-loving jokester who protected her like a brother would.\n\n\u201cWe grew up like siblings because we were all in the same house together,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cHe was superprotective.\u201d\n\nEmmett\u2019s death was confusing for Gordon when she was a child. She remembers hearing screams in her otherwise peaceful home. It was also her first brush with death.\n\nShe said she and her brothers thought that white people were coming to get them.\n\n\u201cWe still didn\u2019t really absorb what was going on; we were children,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the body came, we started to have nightmares.\u201d\n\nThe two white men who were accused of murdering Emmett were acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury.\n\nNow, as a grown woman with children, Gordon still carries the sadness and grief of her cousin\u2019s murder, particularly when she thinks of his mother.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any counseling, which I think we should have had because I still have these crying episodes,\u201d she said, adding that Emmett\u2019s mother \u201ccried every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still have sadness for her pain, losing a child, I can\u2019t imagine losing my child,\u201d Gordon said.\n\nDave Tell, a University of Kansas professor who has written about Emmett, wrote the text that accompanies the new sign. He said it has become particularly important to tell Emmett\u2019s story in full through 2019.\n\n\u201cThe story of Emmett Till can\u2019t be confined to 1955,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe bullet holes are important, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cTill\u2019s story is still going. It\u2019s still very divisive in Mississippi and across the country,\u201d Tell said.\n\nMemory sites, like the one marked by the new memorial sign, \u201chave become the new lunch counters,\u201d Tell said, explaining that lunch counters across the South were \u201cwhere our country worked out its racial politics.\u201d\n\nThe new sign was made by Lite Brite Neon, which has locations in Brooklyn and Kingston, New York.\n\nThe sign is made out of half an inch of AR500 steel and covered in an acrylic panel that\u2019s three-quarters of an inch thick, according to the Emmett Till Memory Project. \u201cThe sign is designed to withstand a rifle round without damage,\u201d the project\u2019s site said.\n\nIn 2014, Tell began working closely with the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, which grew out of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission. The commission installed the first signs with the actor Morgan Freeman, who helped fund the project.\n\nCeremonies like the one Saturday provide the family with a sense of gratification, Gordon-Taylor said.\n\n\u201cOK, you want to shoot it down? We\u2019re going to put it right back up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to forget about Emmett Till and that he was here. Our family has never received judicial justice from the state of Mississippi for Emmett\u2019s murder, so, in some form, this is us saying, \u2018Until you do right by us, basically, you\u2019re never going to forget.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "Emmett Till's family stood on the shore of the Tallahatchie River just outside of Glendora, Mississippi, on Saturday.
