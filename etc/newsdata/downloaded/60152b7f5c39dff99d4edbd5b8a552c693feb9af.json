But you can cut through it with four words: It Only Takes 20.\n\nOr, if you like, #itonlytakes20.\n\nTwenty votes in the Senate separate the drive to impeach the 45th president \u2014 which is now supported by about half of voters \u2014 from the conviction that Donald Trump\u2019s conduct in the Ukraine matter and elsewhere merits.\n\nThe Midwest is hurting\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: The votes likely must come from states where Trump\u2019s polls are cracking, and where new research from Deutsche Bank, the president\u2019s lender of choice, says his policies have stopped helping local economies.\n\nThe economy is stalling in the Midwest, where Donald Trump broke through a purported \u201cblue wall\u201d to win the presidency in 2016.\n\n\u201cThere is significant overlap between manufacturing activity at the county level and the 2016 electoral map, suggesting that more manufacturing-intensive counties, which have shouldered the brunt of the trade war, also skewed towards supporting Republicans,\u201d Deutsche economists Justin Weidner, Matthew Luzzetti and Brett Ryan write.\n\nSee: This map shows how the trade war with China is hitting \u2018Trump country\u2019\n\n\u201cTo the extent that the manufacturing slowdown continues unabated, which is likely unless there is a de-escalation in trade tensions, the electoral map could be more difficult for President Trump and Republicans in 2020,\u201d the Deutsche economists conclude.\n\nTuesday was bizarre, even by recent standards.\n\nFlunking constitutional history\n\nJustice Department lawyers trying to keep Congress from seeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s files from grand-jury proceedings basically got laughed at by a federal judge. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone informed Congress that the administration won\u2019t comply with subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry, flunking constitutional literacy in his letter to Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBy evening, emboldened by Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops from their peacekeeping and mop-up roles in Syria after dispossessing Islamic State of its caliphate, Turkey was preparing to invade.\n\nAnd Trump threatened to sue the city of Minneapolis, claiming his campaign was being overcharged for security at a rally scheduled for Wednesday night.\n\nBut what abides \u2014 as NBC News and the Wall Street Journal released a poll showing 55% of Americans approve of the impeachment inquiry, and 43% think Trump should be removed from office \u2014 is that it would only take 20 Republican senators\u2019 votes out of 53 to end this mess, presuming Democrats in the chamber vote as a bloc.\n\nWhip count\n\nIt\u2019ll be hard to get those votes, but maybe it\u2019s getting less so. Consider polling and economic data while bearing in mind former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s comment that 35 Republican senators would probably convict Trump in a secret ballot.\n\nBegin with swing-state senators up for re-election in 2020. These include Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner, Arizona\u2019s Martha McSally, North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis, Montana\u2019s Steve Daines and Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst. Throw in some from safer states who often criticize Trump, including Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse (also up for re-election), Utah\u2019s Mitt Romney and Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski.\n\nThen there are retirees. Pat Roberts of Kansas is leaving Congress, as his state trends away from traditional GOP loyalties. Then there\u2019s Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, a 79-year-old former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Senate GOP Leader Howard Baker, who helped force Richard Nixon from the presidency after Watergate. They\u2019ve got nothing to lose from bucking Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s 11 \u2014 and counting?\n\nManufacturing recession\n\nThen consider senators from industrial states where Trump\u2019s trade policies are hurting growth, or so Deutsche Bank says \u2014 which removes one incentive senators might have to look away.\n\nIndeed, Deutsche estimates trade-policy uncertainty will shave a full percentage point off economic growth nationally in early 2020 \u2014 calling the coincidence of a slowdown and trade tensions \u201cundeniable.\u201d Counties with high manufacturing exposure have seen slower job growth and wage growth than less industrialized areas \u2014 with the trade war reversing more positive trends that had emerged by 2017, the economists add.\n\nJob openings plunged 11% in August and are down 15.6% in the past year in the Midwest states, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis is where you begin thinking about Pennsylvania\u2019s Pat Toomey and Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman. In a rigorous world, South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott would be wobbly \u2014 his state\u2019s top five employers include Boeing BA, +0.08% and BMW BMW, +0.79% , crucially dependent on trade, and it\u2019s 27% African American, as is Scott himself.\n\nThat\u2019s 14. It\u2019s enough to start the count, at least.\n\nPolling numbers, state by state, should embolden senators to think impeachment is not politically perilous. The president\u2019s long-stable ratings are cracking.\n\nSupport cracking in red states\n\nIn Arizona, Trump\u2019s net approval rating has slipped six points since last October, to negative 4 from plus 2, in Morning Consult polling. In North Carolina, there\u2019s been a six-point dip to negative 3. In Montana, a whopping 13 points to negative 3. He\u2019s down six in Ohio, to negative 5. Down five in Florida to negative 2. He\u2019s even down four in Kansas, to plus 4, in a state Trump won by 20 points. He\u2019s also lost ground, weakening already-negative numbers, in Pennsylvania, Iowa and Wisconsin \u2014 which all have above-average manufacturing exposure.\n\nConventional wisdom on Republican resistance to impeachment has had two prongs. One is that senators fear facing primary challengers backed by Trump\u2019s base. The other is that voters saw Trump fighting the fight for blue-collar workers \u2014 and that he was good for the stock market, though the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 SPX, +1.01% and Dow Jones Industrials DJIA, +0.78% are little changed from early 2018.\n\nBoth arguments are collapsing.\n\nA credible 2020 Senate challenger needed to begin raising money a year ago. Portman and Toomey, who face voters in 2022, know Trump will be \u2014 at best \u2014 a lame duck by then. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank dismantles the economic case for Trump as man of the people.\n\nTuesday\u2019s craziest headline was the line in a Senate Intelligence Committee report saying that Russian spies toasted Trump\u2019s 2016 win on Election Night, boasting that they, the Russians, had made America great again.\n\nSee: Russian election-interference efforts have only increased since 2016: bipartisan Senate report\n\nWhat an impeachment really would take is 20 senators from the president\u2019s party who believe their own platitudes about the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nRead on: Erdogan orders Turkish military offensive in northern Syria in wake of U.S. troop pullout", "description": "It\u2019s hard to overstate the stench of nonsense and corruption emanating from the White House these days.
