CNN's poll had Biden clocking in at 34%, compared to Warren at 19%.\n\nBut the Quinnipiac poll is still sure to stir talk of Warren's potential strength and Biden's potential weakness in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses. Respondents in Quinnipiac's poll still believe Biden has the best chance of defeating President Trump in the general election.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll also has Sen. Bernie Sanders at 15%, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%, Sen. Kamala Harris at 5%, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 3%, with no other Democrat topping 1%.\n\nQuinnipiac polled 1,587 self-identified registered voters from Oct. 17 to Oct. 21.\n\nWarren and Biden will face off again in the next Democratic debate on Nov. 20.\n\nWarren is expected to soon outline how she'd pay for \"Medicare for All.\" She previously stumbled over questions and faced criticisms from her competitors about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the single-payer plan.", "description": "The poll comes on the heels of a CNN poll that showed Biden with the widest lead in months", "authors": ["Kathryn Watson", "Kathryn Watson Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/dac28681-486e-4d14-8736-e42fa06182d0/thumbnail/1200x630g4/5a298c6a2bb621cbb9fe3aeced34a5fb/ap-19256053085969.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
