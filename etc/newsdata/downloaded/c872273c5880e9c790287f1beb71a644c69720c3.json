But the SEC has yet to approve a single bitcoin ETF, citing ongoing fraud and manipulation concerns \u2014 exemplifying the significant regulatory hurdles cryptocurrency investments face.\n\nAlso read: Here\u2019s how to play the trade war with ETFs\n\nLast month, VanEck withdrew a proposed bitcoin ETF for the second time this year.\n\nThe bid by cypto index-fund provider Bitwise was launched in January, and the SEC\u2019s ruling was repeatedly delayed. The Bitwise bid would have stored bitcoin with a regulated third-party custodian, and its tracking price would have been based on a number of exchanges.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was stable immediately after the announcement. Bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.19% was last trading at about $8,610, up 5% over the past five days, but down 31% over the past three months. Despite the summertime tumble, bitcoin is still up 132% year to date.", "description": "In a statement Wednesday, the SEC said the proposed exchange-traded fund from Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca did not meet standards to prevent fraud...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ470_bitcoi_ZG_20171203191018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
