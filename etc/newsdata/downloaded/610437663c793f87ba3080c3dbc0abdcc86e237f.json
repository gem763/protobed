There is no specific reason to think the black hole has one \u2013 but researchers think that the extreme and turbulent gravitational conditions of a supermassive black hole should be a good place to find one.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That should make it possible to see one, if indirectly, by looking for the slight deviations in the orbits of the nearby stars.\n\n\"If you have two stars, one on each side of the wormhole, the star on our side should feel the gravitational influence of the star that's on the other side. The gravitational flux will go through the wormhole,\" said Dejan Stojkovic, cosmologist and professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences. \"So if you map the expected orbit of a star around Sagittarius A*, you should see deviations from that orbit if there is a wormhole there with a star on the other side.\"\n\nSadly, even if there is a wormhole relatively nearby it will not be possible to travel through it and find yourself elsewhere in the universe, scientists say.\n\n\"Even if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren't going to be passing through,\" said Dr Stojkovic. \"Realistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don't know how to do that. To create a huge wormhole that's stable, you need some magic.\"", "description": "Scientists have revealed how to spot a wormhole to another universe.
