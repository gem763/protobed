REUTERS/Giulio Piovaccari/Files\n\nWithout the roar of performance petrol engines to drown out its brakes in action, they risk being a distraction for drivers enjoying the relative silence of their battery powered vehicles.\n\nDeveloping quieter brakes is just one of the challenges the company faces as it looks to expand beyond its traditional businesses and outrun threats to legacy technology as the auto industry evolves for a digital age.\n\nBrembo is developing lighter, electrical brake-by-wire mechanisms used in electric cars to replace traditional hydraulic brakes and faces a threat to its business from so-called regenerative braking systems that capture energy lost when cars slow down and pump it back into the battery.\n\n\u201cElectric engines make no noise, so the braking system could eventually be annoying for the passengers,\u201d said Brembo\u2019s Executive Deputy Chairman Matteo Tiraboschi.\n\n\u201cThey might even be watching a movie in the future while sitting in their cars, thanks to autonomous driving, so our aim is also to make braking increasingly quiet,\u201d he told Reuters at Brembo\u2019s headquarters in Bergamo.\n\nFounded in 1961 in a small workshop near the northern Italian city, the family-owned company believes an acquisition is the answer so it can expand into digital devices and keep pace with changes in how cars are designed and used.\n\nBrembo is not alone. German auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen, for example, bought U.S. rival Wabco (WBC.N) for over $7 billion this year to strengthen its expertise in autonomous-driving technologies.\n\n\u201cCars will be more and more a service,\u201d Tiraboschi said. \u201cPeople will look less and less into performance. A bulb\u2019s light is either on or off, all electric engines will immediately release they power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat people will look at is interiors, comfort, infotainment,\u201d he said.\n\nBEYOND BRAKES\n\nTiraboschi said the brake maker, which supplies premium brands such as Ferrari (RACE.MI), Tesla (TSLA.O), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) as well as several Formula 1 teams, was looking at the auto sector for acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWe must complete the range of products we offer but that must be consistent with what we do,\u201d he said, adding that Brembo\u2019s search was focused on businesses including electronics, autonomous driving and infotainment.\n\nTiraboschi said in June the company, which has a market capitalisation of 3.1 billion euros ($3.5 billion), was eyeing a target of \u201csignificant size\u201d - even as big as Brembo itself.\n\nEarlier this year, the company approved a loyalty share scheme that allows its family owners to retain control even if their stake falls below 50% after an acquisition.\n\nWhile Brembo\u2019s sales are expected to fall by about 2%-3% this year from 2.64 billion euros in 2018 due to persistent global weakness in the auto industry, Tiraboschi said he wants to double revenue in the coming years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do it just with what we do today, as our market shares are already very high,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must think of something different from braking systems.\u201d\n\nAndrea Balloni, an analyst at Mediobanca, said the revenue goal was \u201cchallenging but doable through an acquisition\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, it poses risks in terms of margin reduction and paying a high premium for the acquisition at a time when the whole automotive sector trades at very low multiples,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift towards regenerative brakes, which are connected to the electronic brain of electric cars, could also reduce the amount carmakers and consumers are willing to spend on the traditional callipers, pads and discs, analysts say.\n\nLuca Testa at consultancy AlixPartners said he expected traditional brakes to lose relevance: \u201cSo probably they will be smaller, cheaper and requiring less maintenance.\u201d\n\nTiraboschi, however, said he was convinced electric mobility did not mark the end of traditional brakes, as high-performance braking systems would be fundamental for heavier cars.\n\n\u201cIf you drive on a mountain road or need to brake suddenly, you\u2019ll need traditional brakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot imagine you\u2019ll be able to safely brake just with an electric system - if you drive a high performance car.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.8994 euros)", "description": "Brembo's distinctive coloured brakes stop many of the world's fastest cars but when it comes to the electric vehicles of the future it faces a problem - traditional brakes are noisy.", "authors": ["Giulio Piovaccari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444371316&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N09X", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
