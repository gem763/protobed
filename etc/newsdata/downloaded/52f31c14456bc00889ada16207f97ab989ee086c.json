REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nCAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa promised on Thursday to tackle the prejudice fuelling a wave of riots and xenophobic attacks, as growing international anger over the violence overshadowed a pan-African economic conference in Cape Town.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said at least ten people had died during a week of violence targeting foreign-owned businesses, of whom two were foreigners.\n\n\u201cOver the past few days our country has been deeply traumatised and troubled by acts of violence and criminality directed against foreign nationals and our own citizens,\u201d he said in a televised address.\n\nHe had hoped the three-day World Economic Forum would serve as a shop window for his efforts to revive South Africa\u2019s ailing economy and boost intra-African trade. But the violence, which has also led to hundreds of arrests, has all but eclipsed proceedings.\n\nWhile the foreign victims\u2019 nationalities have not been made public, the rioting, and reprisal attacks, have above all exposed tensions between the host country and Nigeria, the continent\u2019s two biggest economies.\n\nOn Thursday Jim Ovia, chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Zenith Bank and a co-chair of the whole Cape Town event, withdrew, citing the \u201chypersensitivity of the issues surrounding the lives and well-being of Nigerian citizens living in South Africa.\u201d\n\nNigeria, whose vice president had boycotted the summit on Wednesday, also recalled its High Commissioner to South Africa.[nS8N24K08R]\n\nSouth African government officials have up to now largely blamed the attacks on criminals. But Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor acknowledged some of it was being driven by \u201cAfrophobia\u201d - resentment of other Africans living and working there.\n\n\u201cThere is a targeting of Africans from other parts of Africa, we can\u2019t deny that,\u201d she told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference.", "description": "South Africa promised on Thursday to tackle the prejudice fuelling a wave of riots and xenophobic attacks, as growing international anger over the violence overshadowed a pan-African economic conference in Cape Town.", "authors": ["Wendell Roelf", "Alexander Winning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426614056&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF841R5-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
