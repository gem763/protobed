REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L), Europe\u2019s biggest bank by assets, has carried out a strategic review of the French retail business, which has around 270 branches and employs up to 3,000 staff out of 8,000 in France overall.\n\nThe business could be worth about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), analysts and bankers estimated.\n\nAn auction process was expected to kick off in the coming weeks, when confidential information packages would be circulated to potential buyers to undertake due diligence checks on the business, the source said.\n\nLazard declined to comment.\n\nQuinn, who became interim CEO in August after the bank announced the surprise departure of John Flint, has between six to 12 months from that date to make his case for the permanent role, so he is expected to move quickly to try and improve HSBC returns, which have been hit by an economic slowdown in China.\n\nThe French sale is complicated by a general fall in profitability for retail banking among European banks, as low interest rates have constrained returns, banking sources said.\n\nLazard was expected to sound out French banks, including BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Credit Mutuel and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), these sources said, adding that talks would be tough as local banks were in no rush to bulk up their local presence.\n\nHSBC, which makes most of its profits in Asia, said in August it would be laying off about 4,000 people this year.\n\nIts business outlook has deteriorated due to an escalation of the trade war between China and the United States, an easing monetary policy cycle, unrest in its key Hong Kong market and Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union.\n\nHSBC has been present in France, its biggest hub in continental Europe, since 2000 when it bought Credit Commerciale de France (CCF) for about 11 billion euros.", "description": "HSBC Holdings has hired U.S. investment bank Lazard Ltd to sell its French retail business, a source close to the matter told Reuters, as part of a plan by new interim chief executive Noel Quinn to reduce costs across the banking group.", "authors": ["Clara Denina", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441136120&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E19N", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
