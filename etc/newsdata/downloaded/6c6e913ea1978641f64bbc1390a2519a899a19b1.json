You are a menace to other road users because despite lengthy bans, prison sentences and community orders you still meddle with cars and are tempted to get behind the wheel of a car.\"\n\n(Image: Alamy)\n\nNicola Smailes, defending, said her client had long suffered from mental health problems.\n\nAdding that her client was remorseful, Miss Smailes said: \"Really, life is more stable now than it has ever been - and certainly since the 1980s.\"\n\nMagistrates also ordered that Ackerman complete up to 20 rehabilitation activity days and pay \u00a3175 in costs and surcharge.", "description": "\"Menace\" Richard Ackerman, 68, says he \"doesn't give a monkeys\" after collecting a string of convictions", "authors": ["Tom Seaward", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Swindon Advertiser", "Swns.Com", "Jaguar Land Rover", "Alamy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707418.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_OLDIE_DRIVER_004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
