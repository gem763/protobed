Stay clean", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: If there was ever a week to bet Week 6 may be one of the best. Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nA quick rundown on items of interest as Week 6 rolls on in the NFL:\n\nWHO'S HOT: Deshaun Watson. What\u2019s a guy to do for an encore after firing five scoring passes and posting a perfect (158.3) passer rating? Try beating Patrick Mahomes on his own turf. Watson and Mahomes \u2013 pegged to be two of the faces of the NFL for years to come \u2013 meet for the first time on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. Watson\u2019s big day against the Falcons in Week 5 boosted him up the passing charts, as only Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson has a higher passer rating for the season and more touchdown passes (12). Mahomes leads the league with 1,831 passing yards and matches Watson and Lamar Jackson with 11 TD throws.\n\nOn the year, Watson leads the NFL in fourth-down passer rating (144.6), ranks second on third downs (123.2) and has thrown just one pick. But here\u2019s another significant number from last weekend: Zero. Watson wasn\u2019t sacked by Atlanta a week after getting dropped six times by Carolina. The quality of defense was a factor, but so was Watson\u2019s ability to get rid of the ball quicker. After being sacked 62 times last season, he was sacked 18 times through the first four games. That\u2019s the number the Texans (3-2) will need to keep in check against Frank Clark and Co. to have a chance of knocking off the Chiefs (4-1).\n\nAfter his 5-TD performance in Week 5, the Texans' Deshaun Watson is now the No. 3-rated fantasy quarterback on the season.

Falcons owner Arthur Blank issued a vote of confidence this week for his besieged coach, maintaining that now is not the time for a staff change as the team has floundered to a 1-4 start. But that could be a temporary position if it doesn\u2019t turn around. Quinn fired all three coordinators \u2013 offensive, defensive and special teams \u2013 and the result has been a mess. Plus, Quinn has taken over the play-calling for a defense that ranks 31st in points allowed and last in sacks. Nope, he won\u2019t give up those duties. Blank has invested major dollars in the likes of Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and Grady Jarrett, but he\u2019s clearly not getting his money\u2019s worth. And if the victories don\u2019t start piling up, the hot-seat chatter will only intensify, no matter what Blank declares to the contrary.\n\nKEY MATCHUP: Dalvin Cook vs. Eagles' run defense. No, Kirk Cousins is not to be trusted against a quality opponent. But the Vikings quarterback has formidable help in Cook, averaging 5.9 yards per carry with the 542 yards that have him ranked second in the NFL in rushing. But can Cook sizzle against the NFL\u2019s No. 1-ranked run defense? The Eagles, with a streak of eight consecutive regular-season games since allowing a 100-yard rusher, are giving up just 63 yards per game on the ground. And the run support comes from everywhere, evidenced by the 1-2 rank in total tackles by safeties Rodney McLeod and Malcolm Jenkins. And for sentimental value, the Eagles are returning to U.S. Bank Stadium for the first time since winning Super Bowl LII on that turf.\n\nROOKIE WATCH: Nick Bosa. It was striking to hear Richard Sherman \u2013 who made headlines this week for bashing Baker Mayfield \u2013 declare on Monday night that Bosa should be a shoo-in for Pro Bowl honors. Hey, Sherman\u2019s been around and undoubtedly has an eye for talent. But after four games? Then again, Bosa\u2019s big night against Mayfield (two sacks, one forced fumble, one recovery) was a Pro Bowl-type of bid and without question what the 49ers were looking for when they drafted the former Ohio State defensive end with the second pick overall as a cog on a supremely talented D-line. Sherman and other teammates vouch for Bosa\u2019s consistency, which at least indicates the level of respect the rookie is earning as he breaks in on the next level.\n\nNEXT MAN UP: Bill Callahan. Replacing Jay Gruden as Washington\u2019s interim coach, Callahan becomes the team\u2019s ninth coach (including 2002 interim Terry Robiskie) since Dan Snyder bought the once-revered franchise in 1999. And what timing. Callahan\u2019s debut comes at Miami in a matchup of the winless. When Callahan, a well-respected O-line coach, cut off the music during practice and prescribed wind sprints afterward, it sent an old-school message \u2013 intended or not -- about discipline and conditioning.\n\nAnd you know Adrian Peterson, buried by Gruden, must be thrilled. Still, Callahan\u2019s track record includes taking over for the other Gruden (Jon), when he took the Raiders to the Super Bowl in his first season, got blown out by Jon Gruden\u2019s Tampa Bay Bucs, then was fired after a 4-12 campaign the next season that included Callahan blasting the Raiders as \u201cthe dumbest team in America.\u201d Now he\u2019s running Snyder\u2019s team, which has surely drawn some choice descriptions over the years.\n\nSTOMACH FOR AN UPSET: Seahawks at Browns. There\u2019s a narrative out there that suggests Mayfield and teammates perform better when they are dumped on and written off. Well, after the blowout at San Francisco on Monday night \u2013 and layers of insult heaped on from Sherman and Bosa \u2013 conditions might be ripe for the 1 1/2-point home underdogs. For a team that entered the season with so much hope and hype, the Browns (2-3) can\u2019t be as bad as they were against the 49ers, when Mayfield had a career-worst 13.4 passer rating. Odell Beckham Jr. has just four catches for 47 yards and no TDs the past two games. Besides, typical of early NFL seasons, so many teams fluctuate from week to week. Then again, there\u2019s another narrative that Cleveland must contend with: Seattle (4-1) quarterback Russell Wilson, with a triple-digit passer rating in every game, is having an MVP season.\n\nIF PLAYOFFS WERE TODAY \u2026 The Rams (3-2) would be watching from home. It\u2019s not so stunning, considering so many teams over the years have struggled in the season after losing a Super Bowl. It\u2019s the so-called Super Bowl Loser\u2019s Curse. After the previous 52 Super Bowls, only three of the losing teams came back to win it the next year, and just eight got back to the big game. Since 2000, eight of the 18 Super Bowl losers didn\u2019t make the playoffs the next year. That\u2019s part of the backdrop for the showdown against the undefeated 49ers -- as if Todd Gurley\u2019s sudden quad injury, Jared Goff\u2019s seven picks and a defense that has allowed 85 points the past two weeks aren\u2019t enough issues. It\u2019s not time for coach Sean McVay to panic, but with NFC West rivals San Francisco and Seattle surging, the reasons for concern are piling up.\n\nDID YOU NOTICE? Sure, it\u2019s a passing league with throwing records galore broken to be broken again soon. Yet during Week 5, nine teams won by rushing for at least 166 yards \u2013 including four who topped 200 yards on the ground. Typically, the running games crank up later in the year as the weather turns and playoff football arrives. But this in October? The Panthers rolled over Jacksonville with 285 yards and a 176-yard game from NFL rushing leader Christian McCaffrey. The 49ers gashed the Browns with 275 yards and nearly had two 100-yard rushers. The Cardinals almost had a pair of 100-yard runners (Kyler Murray, 93; David Johnson, 91) in rocking Cincinnati for 266 yards. The Colts stung the Chiefs, as Marlon Mack ran for 132. Denver ran for 191 yards in upsetting the Chargers. We\u2019ll see whether this was an aberration or something deeper.\n\nSTAT'S THE FACT: McCaffrey leads the league with 866 yards from scrimmage, which puts him in London with a chance to join some rare company. With 134 yards against the Bucs, the Panthers running back would join Jim Brown and Marshall Faulk as the only players in NFL history with 1,000 yards from scrimmage through six games. McCaffrey could also match a standard set by Edgerrin James if he tallies at least 175 yards from scrimmage.", "description": "If the Texans want to knock off the Chiefs and star quarterback Patrick Mahomes at Arrowhead Stadium, QB Deshaun Watson must avoid getting sacked.", "authors": ["Jarrett Bell", "Published A.M.
