They say they are a family, a father and five children.\u2019\n\nA seventh man, 58, was arrested following the discovery of the family on Tuesday, but is not the father of the children, local Mayor Roger de Groot said. His role is still unclear.\n\nThe Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad daily identified the man who has been arrested as Joseph B, an Austrian carpenter.\n\nJan was identified through social media accounts which he began posting photos to in June this year.\n\nOn his public profile on Facebook it shows he used the platform for several years until 2010, when he posted saying that he had moved to Ruinerwold.\n\nHe no longer posted on the site until June this year, when he announced he was working as an online store manager at Creconat, located in Meppel, around four miles away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to De Telegraaf, Creconat is associated with a timber company called Native Creative Economy, also based in Meppel, which is owned by Josef B.\n\nJan brought attention to his situation after drinking in a local bar in Ruinerwold (Picture: Facebook)\n\nThe owner of the cafe and bar called police, saying Jan appeared \u2018bewildered\u2019 and \u2018confused\u2019 (Picture: Facebook)\n\nA few days before he raised the alarm, Jan posted a pictures of landmarks around Ruinerwold in the dark to Facebook.\n\nIt is thought these were taken while he was walking to the bar.\n\nBar owner Chris Westerbeek \u2013 who called police \u2013 told Dutch broadcaster RTV Drenthe Jan had been in three times but on his last visit told him he could not go home.\n\nChris said: \u2018You could see he had no idea where he was or what he was doing. He said he had run away and that he urgently needed help.\u2019\n\nInvestigators admit they are deeply puzzled by the case and are still working to answer key questions\n\nMayor de Groot told reporters yesterday: \u2018I understand there are a lot of questions. We have many too. The police are investigating all possible scenarios.\u2019\n\nThe landlord of the farm who rented it to Josef B, Alida ten Oever, said the tenant always paid rent on time and that she never saw signs of other people living at the property.\n\nNeighbours told RTV Drenthe that Josef was a private man who never allowed visitors inside the house, which was set back 200 yards from the nearest road and another 100 yards from the nearest building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPictures show it was surrounded by trees and a perimeter fence.\n\nAn aerial picture shows the remote rented farmhouse surrounded by a vegetable garden, high trees and a perimeter fence (Picture: AFP)\n\nA woman from animal ambulance was seen taking cat carriers to the site(Picture: Reuters)\n\nPolice say the family may have been kept at the farm for nine years (Picture: Reuters)\n\nThe landlord said: \u2018We are quite perplexed about it all.\u2019\n\nMayor de Groot told a press conference that neither he nor the police had ever seen anything like it.\n\nSpeaking about the inside of the house, he added: \u2018The police found a number of rooms with makeshift furnishings where the family lived a withdrawn existence.\n\n\u2018That is where the six were found.\u2019\n\nOfficials have not confirmed reports that the family may have held \u2018end of days\u2019 apocalyptic beliefs.\n\nA statement from local police said Josef B was refusing to cooperate with the investigation but was detained and being interrogated.\n\nA spokesman said: \u2018We understand that everyone still has many questions. We do too. That is why we want to do our research thoroughly and carefully.\n\n\u2018This means that we may not be able to answer everything immediately. Simply because sometimes we don\u2019t have answers yet. Or we cannot share them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We have called in a Large Scale Investigation Team (TGO).\n\n\u2018Investigators are probing possible criminal offenses under the leadership of the Public Prosecution Service.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
