The actual jobs report has proven that concern was warranted.\n\nOnly 136,000 jobs were added in September, lower than expectations of 145,000; and wages increased by just by 2.9% for the year, the weakest growth since July 2018. The best part of the report is the fact that the unemployment rate fell \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 to 3.5%, its lowest level in 50 years.\n\nBut the low unemployment rate brings up a long-running and puzzling question \u2013 namely, the lack of significant wage gains. Productivity is increasing as Americans work more hours, but their wages are not reflecting that effort.\n\nSo why are wages not growing at a faster pace?\n\nIncome inequality\n\nThe gap between productivity growth and a typical worker\u2019s compensation has grown significantly since 1979, with productivity increasing six times more than pay, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nGetty Images More\n\nPrior to 1979, there was a strong correlation between productivity and wage growth. From 1948 to 1979, productivity growth was 108.1%, while hourly compensation went up 93.2%. But the gap has been widening since 1979. Productivity went up 69.6% from 1979 to 2018, but hourly pay grew by just 11.6%, according to EPI.\n\nSource: EPI More\n\nTop earners set wages for the rest of the labor force. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who want more power in the economy. So the top 1%, their incomes are not only from the labor market, their incomes are also from owning businesses and stocks and other capital investments,\u201d says Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cSo as workers have less power, a lot of that power has been concentrated in the hands of a few.\u201d\n\nSince 2007, wage growth has been strongest for workers in the top 10% of the wage distribution, according to the EPI. More recently from 2017 to 2018, median wages increased 1.6% over the year, while workers with the highest wages (at the 95th percentile) saw their wages grow 2.7%.\n\nEconomy favors employers\n\nThe number of unemployed people per job opening is 0.8, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means that employers should be fighting for workers.\n\nYet many workers are still not in a position to leverage those labor shortages into wage gains. \u201cThe Great Recession was pretty deep and some people feel just lucky enough to hold onto a job. They may not be asking for raises and employers still feel like they have all the power because they did for so long,\u201d says Gould.\n\nWorkers are contending with less bargaining power as unions have weakened and the prevalence of non-compete clauses has made it harder to switch jobs in pursuit of wage gains.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why you get wage increases is you get a competing offer from another company. You get another offer and you either leave and take that job or you try to negotiate with your employer. But there has been a rise in people across the economy being forced to sign non-compete agreements which keeps them from being able to use that outside option to be able to get higher pay,\u201d says Gould.", "description": "Record low unemployment rate masks slow wage increase.", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nCShna_lnGN8VKp5kElSQQ--~B/aD0zMTA0O3c9MzkwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e39cbcb0-e6e5-11e9-9dbf-1d75526e7d89", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
