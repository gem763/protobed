Well...", "language": "en", "text": "Looks like Libra\u2019s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week isn\u2019t over yet. In addition to major backers like PayPal, eBay, Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard dropping support for Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project, now its logo has become the centre of a legal battle over alleged trademark infringement.\n\nThe logo for Calibra, a subsidiary Facebook formed to oversee the digital currency and its planned 2020 launch, bears a resemblance to one the mobile banking app Current has been using since 2016, a fact the company pointed out shortly after Libra\u2019s announcement in June.\n\n\u201cThis is a funny way to try and create trust in a new global financial system \u2014 by ripping off another fintech firm,\u201d Current\u2019s CEO Stuart Sopp told CNBC at the time.\n\nthis is what happens when you only have 1 crayon left pic.twitter.com/2JY5JfesQD \u2014 Current (@current) June 19, 2019\n\nSo much of a resemblance, in fact, that the company filed a lawsuit against Facebook on Thursday arguing that Calibra\u2019s logo \u201cis not only confusingly similar to, but virtually identical to the Current Marks.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true, Calibra\u2019s logo looks like the corporate brand equivalent of copying another company\u2019s homework. Probably because, well, that\u2019s essentially what happened: Both logos were purportedly created by the same designer, a San Francisco branding firm called Character, according to CNBC. Character is also named as a defendant in the suit. The firm did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nGiven that the two were likely designed three years apart, there\u2019s a chance that each logo came from completely different teams at the design firm. After all, a squiggly line in a circle isn\u2019t exactly ground-breaking design. But for both to be created for digital finance ventures and share the same colour palette to boot? That\u2019s shady as hell.\n\nThis lawsuit is just the latest blow to Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency venture before it\u2019s even gotten off the ground. Libra has prompted international scrutiny from banking and antitrust officials, with recent reports that the DOJ and the FTC have opened antitrust investigations into the tech giant only fuelling these suspicions. Likely looking to avoid similar inquiries, five of the 28 founding corporate supporters planned to run Libra\u2019s regulatory body have hightailed it from the project in the last week.\n\nGizmodo has reached out to Current and Facebook and will update this article with their responses.", "description": "Looks like Libra\u2019s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week isn\u2019t over yet.
