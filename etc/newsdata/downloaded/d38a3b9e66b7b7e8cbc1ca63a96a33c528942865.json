'Much of what he said I did not believe.'\n\nThe giant redwood was planted in 1842 by John Dillwyn Llewelyn, a keen botanist and pioneer of photography, on the Penllergare Estate in Swansea.\n\nIt grew to 90ft in height with a 16ft in circumference and stood in a forest bordering 14 acres of land sold by the city council for development.\n\nTree consultant Jeremy Barrell said the tree 'was likely to be one of the earliest introductions' of giant redwoods in Britain, The Times reported.\n\nThe giant redwood was planted in 1842 by John Dillwyn Llewelyn, a keen botanist and pioneer of photography, on the Penllergare Estate in Swansea. It grew to 90ft in height with a 16ft in circumference and stood in a forest bordering 14 acres of land sold for development\n\nThe historic 176-year-old tree (pictured) brought from North America was felled at a new housing estate\n\nDistrict Judge Thomas said that Sauro told site manager Carl Anderson and tree surgeon Arwyn Morgan to fell the trees even though they were protected by a preservation order and not on the land that he owned.\n\n'It is inconceivable on this evidence that the felling of this tree and the ancient woodland was done in any other way than deliberately,' the judge said.\n\n'Mr Anderson clearly was aware of what was going on and I am satisfied he authorised Mr Morgan to take down these trees.\n\n'However, Mr Anderson is the site manager employed by the company and in my view, in making these flagrant breaches of the planning conditions and the tree protection order, he could not possibly have the authority to do so.'\n\nMorgan, 50, admitted breaking a preservation order by cutting down the giant redwood.\n\nEnzo Homes and Sauro were found guilty of contravening a tree preservation order and will both be sentenced on Tuesday.\n\nThey are applying to the High Court for the judgment to be reviewed.\n\nThe sprawling redwood (shown) grew 90ft high and five metres in circumference at the forest site in South Wales\n\nThe tree was chopped down 'by mistake' by building firm Enzo's homes - who are developing 80 houses at the site next to the woods (shown)", "description": "Fiorenzo Sauro, the director of Enzo Homes, ordered the 176-year-old tree bordering on land he wanted to develop a housing estate on to be cut down despite its protected status.", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/19566616-0-image-a-29_1570755592909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
