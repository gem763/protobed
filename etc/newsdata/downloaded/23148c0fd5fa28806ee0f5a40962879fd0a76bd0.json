Officials close to Pence told the Post that he was unaware of Trump's efforts to dig up damaging information on the Bidens.\n\nThe Post also reported that Pence's national security adviser, Keith Kellogg, had been monitoring the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky in which the president called for a probe of the Bidens.\n\nWhat the committees want: The committees are seeking all documents and communications relating to Trump's April 21 and July 25 phone calls with Zelensky. They also asked Pence for documentation on meetings with former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerTrump declares 'case closed' after text messages reveal officials pressed Ukraine on inquiries The Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Trump broadens call for Biden probes Top US diplomat threatened to quit over Ukraine dealings MORE, who appeared before a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill on Thursday, as well as with Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe committees further asked for documents related to Pence's own call with Zelensky on Sept. 18, and anything he knew about withholding aid from Ukraine.\n\nTiming: The request for documents came a day after Trump publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate Biden, which Pence defended.\n\n\"One of the main reasons we were elected to Washington, D.C., was to drain the swamp,\" Pence told reporters on Thursday. \"And I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\"\n\nThe background: Biden as vice president had pushed for Ukraine to oust its then-prosecutor general for failing to properly investigate corruption. The prosecutor general had at one point looked into Burisma, the energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board. There is no evidence either of the Bidens engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nBut Volker defends Biden: Kurt Volker, the former State Department special envoy to Ukraine, testified to Congress that he was not involved in or aware of any effort to press Ukraine to investigate allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden, according to a copy of his opening statement obtained by The Hill.\n\nVolker defended Biden's character and told lawmakers that he did not know that President Trump mentioned Biden's name during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until the White House released a rough transcript of the conversation last week.\n\nVolker repeatedly emphasized during his remarks he did not believe the allegations against Biden to be credible.\n\n\"I have known former Vice President Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me. I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country,\" Volker said during his testimony.\n\nVolker also testified that he told Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump holds call with House GOP amid impeachment inquiry Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Overnight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign MORE that accusations against the former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate were \"not credible.\"\n\nOther efforts: The committees' request for documents is the latest in a series of document and witness demands as Democrats ramp up their impeachment inquiry.\n\nLast week, the panels subpoenaed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Democrats claim new momentum from intelligence watchdog testimony Overnight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign MORE for documents and requested depositions with current and former State Department officials, including Volker and Sondland.\n\nThey have also issued subpoenas to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer who was involved in urging Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, the committees threatened to issue a subpoena to the White House if documents related to Trump exerting pressure on the Ukrainian government aren't turned over by Friday.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee also conducted a closed-door briefing with the intelligence community inspector general about the preliminary review of a whistleblower complaint about Trump's efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens.\n\nGOP senator said he confronted Trump: Sen.

Johnson said that Sondland told him assistance for Ukraine was connected to Trump's desire to have the country carry out investigations relating to the 2016 elections.\n\nThe senator said he spoke with Trump on Aug. 31 and that on the call, Trump denied that he told officials to connect military aid to the promise of investigations by Ukraine.\n\n\"He said... 'No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?'\" Johnson told the Journal.\n\nRead more from The Hill on the unfolding story:\n\n-- The 7 most explosive exchanges in Trump's Ukraine envoy texts\n\n-- READ: Volker's opening statement to Congress in Ukraine investigation\n\n-- Intelligence watchdog huddles with members as impeachment push grows\n\n-- Trump asserts he has 'absolute right' to ask other countries for help probing corruption\n\n\n\nESPER IN KENTUCKY: Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign Overnight Defense: Pentagon didn't listen in on Ukraine call | Questions linger over delayed aid | State formally approves M Ukraine arms sale Pentagon: Recent North Korean test was a short- to medium-range ballistic missile MORE was at the University of Louisville in Kentucky on Friday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellOvernight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign Trump says House Democrats 'unfortunately' have the votes to impeach Cornyn makes waves with tweet about Justice investigating Biden MORE (R-Ky.).\n\nThe pair held a town hall with members of the Fort Knox community. During the event, McConnell pledged a new middle school at Fort Campbell will be funded.\n\nThe new school was intended to relieve overcrowding at the existing middle school, but the project has been delayed because $62.6 million for it was diverted to build President Trump's proposed border wall as part of his national emergency declaration.\n\n\"I remain committed to working with Secretary Esper and his team fully fund the new middle school at Fort Campbell, something they've wanted for years, and I secured in the first place,\" McConnell said.\n\nEasier said than done: Democrats have been loath to replenish the $3.6 billion in military construction funding that Trump tapped for his border wall, arguing that gives Trump their blessing to ignore Congress' original allocations.\n\nIt's one of the fights that has held up the government funding bills this year, leading to a stopgap spending measure that took effect at the start of the fiscal year this week.\n\nIRAN HACK TARGETS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: An Iranian-linked threat group attempted to identify and attack various email accounts belonging to Microsoft customers over a 30-day period, including those linked to an unnamed U.S. presidential campaign as well as current and former U.S. officials, the company announced Friday.\n\nIn a blog post, Microsoft detailed how a group known as \"Phosphorus,\" which the company believes may be linked to the Iranian government, made around 2,700 attempts to target customer email accounts, and then attacked 241 of these accounts between August and September of this year.\n\nIn addition to U.S. officials and the unnamed campaign, the threat group also targeted accounts belonging to journalists covering global politics and to Iranians living outside of Iran, according to the company.\n\nMicrosoft said that four of the attacks successfully compromised email accounts, though none of them were related to the U.S. presidential campaign or the government officials.\n\nWho was the candidate?: Reuters, citing sources familiar with the operation, later reported the hackers targeted Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nTrump's campaign website is the only one of the remaining major candidates' sites linked to Microsoft's cloud email service, according to Reuters.\n\nTim Murtaugh, the director of communications for the Trump campaign, told The Hill that \"we have no indication that any of our campaign infrastructure was targeted.\"\n\nContext: The targeting of U.S. accounts by the Iranian threat group comes after an escalation of tensions between the two countries, particularly in the wake of the U.S. blaming Iran for attacking two Saudi Arabian oil facilities last month.\n\nThe announcement also comes as Microsoft seeks to shore up security for its products and systems heading into the 2020 elections.\n\nLast month, the company announced that it would provide free updates for voting systems running Windows 7 software through the 2020 elections, which otherwise would not have been updated without voting jurisdictions paying for this service after January 2020.\n\nMicrosoft also launched its \"Defending Our Democracy\" program in 2018 with the aim of protecting political campaigns from hacking operations and to defend against disinformation campaigns online.\n\nON TAP FOR MONDAY\n\nThe Hudson Institute will host \"Protecting American Interests in Fragile States\" with a keynote address from Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources director James Richardson at 10:45 a.m. https://bit.ly/337Gird\n\n\n\nICYMI\n\n-- The Hill: Nuclear watchdog reports improved cooperation with Iran\n\n-- The Hill: Death toll surges past 40 in Iraq unrest\n\n-- The Hill: Postal Service releases Purple Heart medal Forever Stamp\n\n-- The Hill: Fort Bliss soldier who saved children during El Paso shooting arrested for desertion\n\n-- Defense News: Here's how many foreign military sales the US State Department OK'd in FY 2019\n\n-- Stars and Stripes: VA is millions over budget, years behind on cemetery projects\n\n-- Reuters: US Afghanistan envoy meets Taliban in Pakistan: sources", "description": "THE TOPLINE: House Democrats have followed through on their threat to issue a subpoena to the White House for documents", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
