It was causing her body parts to grow\n\nShe had been misdiagnosed with diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - elevated male hormones in women.\n\nBy the end of March 2019, Ms Churan, from Sudbury in Ontario, Canada, was given an IGF-1 blood test.\n\nIt measures the quantity of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1), which controls tissue and bone growth in the body.\n\nA typical reading should be between 97 and 297, depending on age, but Ms Churan's measurement came back a whopping 1015.\n\nDoctors scrambled to work out why she had such elevated levels, and subsequent tests confirmed she had a benign tumour on her pituitary gland \u2013 part of the brain which releases hormones that control growth in the body.\n\nThe mass caused acromegaly, a rare condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone and causes body parts to become abnormally large.\n\nIt affects roughly 325 people a year in the UK, and 1,625 in the US. Ms Churan believes she had been living with the condition for 15 years.\n\nThe mass caused acromegaly, a rare condition in which the body produces too much growth hormone and causes body parts to become abnormally large\n\nShe had the tumour removed through her nose on April 6 and within months her hands, feet and facial features shrunk back down to a normal size\n\nMs Churan's hand measurements before and shortly after surgery to remove the tumour which secreted excess growth hormone\n\nShe hopes to encourage others with inexplicable symptoms to stay positive and push for answers\n\nShe had the tumour removed through her nose on April 6 and within months her hands, feet and facial features shrunk back down to a normal size.\n\nMs Churan said: 'I have seen more than ten doctors over the years who would just address my symptoms.\n\n'I have been misdiagnosed with borderline diabetes, generalised anxiety disorder, depression and PCOS.\n\n'I told this doctor that my face was changing, and I was getting uglier, and that I didn't understand why I was gaining weight since I was barely eating.\n\nWHAT IS ACROMEGALY? Acromegaly is a rare condition in which the pituitary gland in the brain creates too much growth hormone. It is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour in the brain which affects the gland. Acromegaly is usually diagnosed in people between 30 and 50 years old, but can happen at any age. It is a rare condition with only around four to six new cases per million people being diagnosed each year \u2013 roughly 325 people a year in the UK, or 1,625 in the US. Symptoms include swollen hands or feet, tiredness and difficulty sleeping, changes in facial features, numbness in the hands, abnormal periods in women, erection problems in men, and headaches or blurred vision. Some symptoms may be caused by the tumour pressing on other parts of the brain. Having the condition increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the tumour and relieve pressure on the pituitary gland.

They all tried to cheer me up, but I was crying uncontrollably, and I knew something was wrong.\n\n'My best friend, Anisa, held my hand while we went from pub to pub and I remember her asking me where my confidence had gone since we met at university.\n\n'Thankfully she was there for me because I would have never made it through that night without her cheering me on.'\n\nMs Churan hopes to encourage others with inexplicable symptoms to stay positive and push for answers.\n\nShe added: 'There really is no information other than extreme cases online. There's barely any awareness or tools to help people recognise the signs, so many cases are diagnosed as hormonal disorders.\n\n'I saw the scariest photos of Andre the giant and others who had not been treated early on during the process. I was mortified, scared, and hopeless.\n\n'I had this tumour for over 15 years based on the photos I've looked back over, but I just thought it was the way I was ageing at the time.\n\n'I questioned my growth a few years ago when my feet shot up half a size, but I had gained weight too and I thought it must have been caused by water retention or my borderline diabetes diagnosis.'\n\n'You must stay positive and find hope in any way you can while fighting. I want people to understand that a simple blood test can often diagnose a pituitary tumour.\n\n'Don't just accept any diagnosis without digging deeper and asking if something else could be causing it. Never judge a book by its cover because those covers can be redrawn, just like more pages can be added to a story.'", "description": "Rebecca Churan, 29, from Sudbury in Ontario, Canada, questioned whether it was all in her head when she noticed her facial features growing increasingly bigger every year.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20276288-0-image-a-35_1572262066372.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
