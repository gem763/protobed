And it\u2019s getting more international every day. I know at least five artists who came to Athens for residencies and ended up living here.\u201d It\u2019s not just foreign artists who are attracted by the affordable rents, great weather, and the thrill of living among so many glorious ancient monuments. \u201cYoung Greeks are also coming back to find their space here,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s still land to plant your seed \u2013 and things are happening so fast, you can see it flourishing.\u201d\n\nFormidably self-assured, Dimitrakopoulos encapsulates the possibilities that Athens offers; she returned from Los Angeles to her home city in 2013 and took over Art Athina aged 26. She also runs Mum Social Club, a monthly book, cooking, and pottery club in the 5,400 sq ft studio owned by Jannis Varelas, her fianc\u00e9 and one of Greece\u2019s most successful artists. (The night before, Varelas opened his solo show at the Benaki Museum\u2019s Pireos 138 outpost, a huge space with a free-ranging roster of modern art, architecture, and photography exhibitions.)\n\nAn immersive antidote to the air kisses and small talk of gallery openings, Mum Social Club symbolises the rebirth of Kypseli. Once the bastion of the Athenian bourgeoisie, this downtown neighbourhood fell on hard times in the early Nineties. As the well-to-do locals moved to suburbia, the first wave of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Africa settled into the Bauhaus buildings, Sixties flats, and ravaged (but ravishing) early 20th-century town houses. Now artists are moving in, too \u2013 along with property developers from China and Israel, hungry to capitalise on Airbnb and Greece\u2019s \u201cGolden Visa\u201d scheme for investors.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Howard", "Travel Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/athens-port-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
