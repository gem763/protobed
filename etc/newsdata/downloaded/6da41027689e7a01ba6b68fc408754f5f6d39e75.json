Under current rules - known as the National Market System plan, or Regulation NMS - fee changes become effective immediately to ensure retail investors get the best price possible. NMS also prevents trades being executed at prices inferior to bid and offer prices displayed at other trading venues.\n\nUnder Tuesday's proposal, the delay before implementing changes could make it tougher for exchange operators to compete quickly on price, potentially limiting future revenue growth.\n\n\"The fees charged by NMS plans affect a wide variety of investors and market participants,\" SEC chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement. \"This rulemaking will help ensure that NMS plan fee changes benefit from review and comment by investors and market participants before those fees can be charged.\"\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [WASHINGTON] The US securities regulator on Tuesday proposed a change to the way exchange operators alter their fees, in a move aimed at improving transparency, but which could make it harder for operators to compete on price to propel revenue growth. .
