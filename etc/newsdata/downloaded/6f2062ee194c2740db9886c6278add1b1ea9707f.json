There are only a few days left in the legislative calendar before the end of 2019. If Nancy Pelosi fails to put the USMCA up for a vote this month, it will be a signal failure of our political process and an economic catastrophe.\u201d\n\nThe video comes on the heels of President Trump\u2019s contentious White House meeting with congressional Democrats, including Pelosi, on Wednesday, when the Speaker stormed out of the meeting. Pelosi has been pushing forward with an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d into President Trump but refuses to hold a vote in the House officially opening impeachment proceedings\u2014thereby opening Democrats up to criticism from the White House and Republicans in Congress who say the process is illegitimate.\n\nPelosi has also not scheduled any votes on USMCA, the trade agreement that the Trump administration has negotiated with Canada and Mexico in an effort to replace the highly unpopular North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton\u2014a Republican and a Democrat\u2014ushered into being.\n\nNavarro laying out how USMCA would be more significant to the United States than any trade deal with China is also important, because as he points out the U.S. conducts almost twice as much trade with both countries than with China and, even more importantly, five times as many exports.\n\nUnder NAFTA, America\u2019s working class has seen significant job losses due to manufacturing moving overseas, especially to Mexico. Trump campaigned hard against NAFTA in 2016, upsetting the traditional partisan orthodoxy that Republicans were in favor of big trade deals like that while Democrats\u2014close with Big Labor\u2014were not.\n\nIn so doing, Trump pulled a significant amount of blue-collar working class lifelong Democrats over to vote for him\u2014especially in America\u2019s rust belt\u2014thereby winning states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and soaring into the White House with 306 electoral votes and victories in 30 and a half states.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, the 2016 Democrat nominee, had serious issues on trade policy which cost her dearly with union workers in the working class and middle class throughout the country.\n\nThis new video from the White House puts in stark terms the consequences that would rest squarely on Pelosi\u2019s shoulders should she fail to call the vote on the USMCA\u2014which many expect would pass Congress with broad bipartisan support.\n\nBy saying she would cause an \u201ceconomic catastrophe,\u201d Navarro and the White House are putting the ball in her court\u2014meaning the future of this rests explicitly with her. It also draws attention to the fact that Democrats have spent all year pushing investigations and hearings on Trump, leading up to the current \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d rather than legislating.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it lays out how Trump has upheld his end of the bargain on NAFTA with American voters. He promised to get rid of it, and reached a deal to do so. Now NAFTA\u2019s fate\u2014and the fate of the USMCA as its replacement\u2014rests with the Democrats in the House.\n\nUnder Pelosi\u2019s speakership this year, Democrats have zero legislative accomplishments\u2014a massive failure for a political party that was swept into the majority in the 2018 midterm elections on high hopes and big promises of things like infrastructure, healthcare, trade, and other kitchen-table issues on which they have thus-far failed to deliver. Pelosi could alleviate some of the pressure on some of her so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrat members representing districts in which Trump defeated Clinton in 2016 by allowing the vote on USMCA to happen this month, as Navarro is pushing.\n\nDemocrats run the risk of losing their House majority after just one term if they continue down the path they are on\u2014investigate, attack Trump, and fail to legislate altogether\u2014given that Republicans only need to retake a net 19 seats to take back the majority in 2020. A whopping 31 Democrats represent districts in which Trump triumphed over Clinton in 2016, 13 of which Trump won by more than six percent. Republicans have identified another ring of about 25 more districts they think they could win under the right circumstances, causing serious consternation among Democrats.\n\nIf Pelosi allows this vote, though, she could provide many of her vulnerable members with an out\u2014an opportunity to go home and say they have been working with the administration and are not just solely focused on impeachment.", "description": "Peter Navarro is out with a video calling on Nancy Pelosi to hold a vote this month on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement.", "authors": ["Matthew Boyle"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Trump-Trudeau-Nieto-G20-Argentina-sign-USMCA-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
