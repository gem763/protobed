But not all of them are Fabien Cousteau.\n\nCousteau, the grandson of legendary ocean explorer and documentary filmmaker Jacques Cousteau, has embraced his grandfather\u2019s legacy and is following in his footsteps. But the younger Cousteau is not only an ocean explorer and filmmaker, but also a conservationist and founder of the nonprofit Ocean Learning Center.\n\nAnd he\u2019s also a huge watch fan, and not just because they look cool and it\u2019s fun to geek out on mechanical movements. Cousteau is an ambassador for Prospex, the dive watch line for the massive Japanese watchmaker Seiko (8050.T).\n\nCousteau doesn\u2019t just like the way the new Prospex LX wristwatch looks, he dives with it. Recent trips to Nicaragua, the frigid North Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, and the Aquarius Reef Base in Florida show he\u2019s no slouch on the diving front.\n\nSeiko Prospex LX watch More\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of the brand since I was a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cProspex has always been an integral part of scuba diving,\u201d Cousteau says, and having a mechanical watch that works when electronics might fail under extreme conditions, is a must.\n\nIn addition to his brand ambassadorship, Seiko also sponsors Cousteau\u2019s Ocean Learning Center (OLC). The OLC focuses on public awareness, education and special projects. These activities and initiatives include beach cleanups, dive missions, coral reef and sea turtle restoration projects, as well as educational programs geared toward elementary school children all the way to the college students.\n\nYou can learn more about the Ocean Learning Center here.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
