Warren were to win\u2019 was getting a lot of airtime in our meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same WSJ piece reports, \"Analysts with Piper Jaffray\u2019s Simmons Energy heard so much about Ms. Warren from money managers recently that they parsed her energy and infrastructure policy proposals in a note sent to clients last week.\"\n\nWhere it stands: Warren would need Capitol Hill's help for an outright fracking ban, and that's very unlikely to materialize.\n\nBut even the prospect of curtailing fracking and new leasing on federal lands is sending ripples through the sector.\n\nRBC's U.S. production forecast would be 1.2 million barrels per day lower in 2025 if there was a fracking ban imposed on federal lands starting in 2021.\n\nThe intrigue: Targeting federal lands in particular would create bigger risks for some companies than others, based on how much of their acreage centered in those areas versus state and private holdings.\n\nRBC and other analysts are already tracking which companies would have significant exposure, like big independent producers Devon Energy and Concho Resources.\n\nBut, but, but: Efforts to stymie drilling on federal lands would face vigorous legal and political opposition and bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nThe RBC report notes that the industry would \"pursue legal recourse including an injunction until courts make a final decision on that action.\"\n\nAnd a Bloomberg story on Warren's plans earlier this month, summarizing analysis from Sanford C. Bernstein's Bob Brackett, states that \"any impact from a Warren win may be short-lived.\"\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "She's pledged to halt fracking, which has propelled the U.S. oil boom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ReIYWKBH6DKssLhRDV_buFJauXo=/0x525:5035x3357/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571750071579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
