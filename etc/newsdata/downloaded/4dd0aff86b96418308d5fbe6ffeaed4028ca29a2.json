But a cash crisis has hit the head coach\u2019s World Cup plans, with former captain Will Carling even forced to go on a fundraising mission in the City of London to cover a six-figure shortfall. If the RFU were not cutting back, perhaps Calder\u2019s presence for the knockout stages would have been a wise investment.\n\nDr Sherylle Calder was seen flying home early from the World Cup and Tokyo on Monday\n\nEddie Jones refused to conduct pre-match radio interviews with the BBC on Saturday for the first time. The England coach has spoken to the brilliant 5 Live commentary team before every match of his four-year tenure, but this week he snubbed them after taking issue with a headline on their website.\n\nJones was unhappy with the way his comments about Scotland\u2019s legal battle with World Rugby over Typhoon Hagibis were presented.\n\nNaomi: Yes, I\u2019m a Blossom fan now!\n\nJapan\u2019s players received a good luck message from local tennis star Naomi Osaka ahead of today\u2019s quarter-final against South Africa.\n\nThe two-time Grand Slam winner said she was converted to the sport after giving wing Yu Tamura his man of the match award after Japan\u2019s win over Scotland.

And, yes, I have a shirt signed by all the team.\u2019\n\nOsaka\u2019s schedule prevented her from attending the game.\n\nNaomi Osaka says she is a Blossoms fan after the country's fine World Cup run\n\nMichael Leitch mania continues in Japan with fans queuing for up to two hours for coffee at the captain\u2019s coffee shop in western Tokyo.\n\nThe branch is called \u2018Plus Sixty Four\u2019 which is the international dialling code for New Zealand, where Leitch was born.\n\nMichael Leitch hysteria continues as fans go to the Japan captain's coffee shop in Tokyo\n\nWales were helped to prepare for their quarter-final with France by a more-than-qualified drinks carrier \u2014 chief executive Martyn Phillips.\n\nWRU boss Phillips, who earns in excess of \u00a3300,000-a-year, is back in Japan for the latter stages. He was in the Far East at the start of the tournament to deal with the departure of coach Rob Howley over alleged betting breaches.\n\nAt their captain\u2019s run in Beppu on Sunday, it was all hands on deck with Phillips stepping in to help Warren Gatland\u2019s players stay hydrated. Phillips, wearing a Wales team tracksuit, took orders from assistant strength and conditioning coach John Ashby.\n\nQBE Business Insurance has developed a set of predictions for the World Cup based on a mathematical formula created by their team of experts.
