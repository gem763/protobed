Both yellow cards should not have stood. Do I think he will get a reputation? Yes, I do. That's why I raise it here.\n\n\u201cHe is not that type of player. He keeps running that quickly and, if you look at the video, there was contact, both today and in the Wolves game.\n\n\u201dHe is such an honest boy. He gets up, runs and takes people on. Sometimes, he gets kicked and sometimes, with that pace, a little touch or nudge will be enough for him to fall.\u201c", "description": "The Welsh winger has been booked twice for simulation this season - against Wolves and Crystal Palace", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659340.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
