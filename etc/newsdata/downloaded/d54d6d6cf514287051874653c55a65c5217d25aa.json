A title could be the reward.", "language": "en", "text": "Luzardo is still one of the league\u2019s most promising young arms. Giolito should get a handful of American League Cy Young Award votes. That\u2019s the cost of trying to contend every season. It takes a willingness to part with top prospects and a lot of money. The Nationals began the process in 2012 and are just now seeing the rewards.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf Sean Doolittle is getting outs for us in the World Series, then giving up Luzardo was worth it,\u201d said a member of the Nationals front office in March, sitting by a backfield at their spring training facility in West Palm Beach, Fla., suggesting that organizational pitching depth can be defined in many ways. \u201cIf that happens, then you can look at that deal and say, \u2018Okay, it really worked. It made sense.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd now here we are, in the final week of October, with the Nationals two wins away from a title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to win consistently and have a good farm system,\u201d General Manager Mike Rizzo said before the Nationals beat the Astros, 12-3, in Game 2 on Wednesday. \u201cBecause you use your prospect capital to acquire major league players. But that\u2019s been our plan the whole time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 in the spring, in Houston this week, always \u2014 is pretty simple for the Nationals: A championship would make the deals worth it.\n\nAD\n\nMaybe the long view of the Doolittle trade won\u2019t look great for them. Blake Treinin and Sheldon Neuse were also shipped out alongside Luzardo. Parting with Giolito, a 25-year-old ace, is already favoring the White Sox. The Nationals entered this season a bottom-10 minor league system, according to multiple major ranking sites, and are hoping a few pitchers make sharp turnarounds. But the Nationals are close to having a sound, if not short-term, justification for their actions. There\u2019s great risk in trying to build a contender every winter. And Rizzo, a longtime area scout, knows how hard it is to find talent that translates to the major league level.\n\nYet he is deliberate in using the Nationals\u2019 scouting department as a real-time tool. Washington has a homegrown nucleus of Stephen Strasburg, Anthony Rendon, Ryan Zimmerman, Juan Soto and Victor Robles. They added Max Scherzer, Patrick Corbin, Kurt Suzuki and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, among others on this team, in free agency across the last half decade. That leaves Trea Turner, Yan Gomes, Daniel Hudson, Eaton and Doolittle as the key pieces brought in via trade.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lot of them are on the field for us,\u201d Rizzo said of the players his scouting department brings in. \u201cBut a lot of them turn into Trea Turner and Joe Ross, they turn into Sean Doolittle, they turn into those types of players. We\u2019re always here to win now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals didn\u2019t give up much for a 22-year-old Turner in 2015. The return for Gomes included outfielder Daniel Johnson, who made the Futures Game this summer, but Johnson is still in the Cleveland Indians\u2019 system. Hudson cost a mid-level pitching prospect at the trade deadline this past July. Then Eaton and Doolittle were swapped for very notable players.\n\nEaton, 30, has four hits, a home and three RBI so far in the World Series. Doolittle, 33, has only re-emerged as the most important pitcher in a thin bullpen.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing is what I was brought here to do, and contribute meaningful innings in the back end of games for a winning team,\u201d Doolittle said in Houston on Wednesday. \u201cBut watching Luzardo throw for Oakland this year, I joked to guys here several times like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you traded that guy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nDoolittle admits to thinking about Luzardo and the trade when he first arrived in Washington in 2017. That Nationals team was playoff-bound and put him right into a high-leverage role. He excelled, posting a 2.40 ERA in 30 appearances, then made his second All-Star Game the next season. That made him feel like he returned the Nationals\u2019 investment.\n\nThen Luzardo was called up by the Athletics this September, flashed his dominant stuff and, just like that, Doolittle saw the 22-year-old all over clubhouse TVs. It mostly made him laugh and crack the same one-liners. They will always be linked, at least to some degree, and he\u2019s more than at peace with that.\n\nAD\n\nBut the veteran was busy rebuilding his mechanics after spending two weeks on the injured list in late August. He had to rest his arm and deal with lingering issues in his right knee. It continued a year-long battle with his mechanics, starting in March, and Doolittle didn\u2019t really solve them until a matchup with Kolten Wong in St. Louis on Sept. 16.\n\nAD\n\nWong was fouling off Doolittle\u2019s fastball and the lefty needed a backup plan. So he tried a slide step \u2014 to throw off Wong, and to keep a runner near first \u2014 and struck Wong out. He dove into the analytics after and noticed his spin rate and extension numbers were much better. He basically found a fix by accident.\n\nHe has been using a slide step ever since, for the first time in his career, and has allowed two earned runs in 8 \u2154 innings this postseason. He has finished three games. He is the only reliever remaining from the Nationals\u2019 last playoff team in 2017. He\u2019s one of just two relievers remaining from the bullpen they started this season with.\n\nAD\n\nHe is getting the biggest outs of a title run, like the front office imagined he could, but doesn\u2019t tie that to how he got here. He\u2019ll leave that to everyone else.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of this team won a trade, or that team did. I think it commodifies players in an unnecessary way,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cLet\u2019s just go win a World Series. How\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The bottom line is pretty simple for Washington: A championship would make the deals worth it.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EOebp3rfB8R8phODuEUhiDONfFw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HLSPNSHVJII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
