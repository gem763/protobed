In an interview in June, Barnett told This is Money that while the potential disappearance of cash was something the firm worried about and gave a lot of thought to, it 'wasn't his job to provide that cash'.\n\nNatalie Ceeney, chairwoman of the Access to Cash review, said: 'This is a very positive and welcome initiative from Mastercard.\n\n'Supporting local shops to offer cashback will help maintain access to cash, and benefit retailers and consumers alike. I'm delighted that Mastercard have taken this step.'", "description": "Under the initiative, which kicks off next April, Britain's local shops and businesses will earn 12p every time they give out cashback to someone paying with a Mastercard debit card.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
