Itsines, 27, is wearing her trademark uniform: activewear. Today, it\u2019s black leggings with a grey fleece zipped jumper and her hair tied in a ponytail. Pearce, 26, sports a beard, beige cardigan and a white T-shirt that reveals years of lifting weights.\n\nThe son of a wine tour operator and a nurse, Pearce left home at 16. At times he slept at friends\u2019 places, sometimes he slept in his car and sometimes in public toilet blocks. He\u2019s taciturn on the subject of his upbringing, offering up little more than he chose to leave home of his own accord. \u201cI was always very ambitious,\u201d he says.\n\nHe rattles off financial statistics as if he completed the double degree in commerce and law at Flinders University that he ditched midway through to focus on personal training, and ultimately building Sweat. He met Itsines in between the barbells and exercise machines at the gym. Her parents are both teachers and she had been planning to follow the same career path, but deferred her study to take up personal training instead. The pair haven\u2019t looked back.\n\nIn many ways Itsines is an accidental entrepreneur. At her first fitness job at a women-only gym she was told to take before and after photos of clients. She clung to the habit when she set up her own business, training clients under the patio of her mother\u2019s home. It was when a cousin suggested she post the before and after shots on Instagram that requests for exercise tips started flooding in. \u201cMost businesses are trying their hardest to find a lead,\u201d Pearce recalls. \u201cWe had thousands of them.\u201d\n\nBikini Body Guide\n\nIn 2015 they poured the profits from the Bikini Body Guide e-book into an interactive app, a one-stop shop combining a menu plan with Itsines\u2019 workouts of 28-minute circuits: lunges, push-ups, mountain climbers, burpees and more. A messaging system allows users to form their own mini-motivational communities. Women post their own before and after shots on Instagram and Facebook, with the hashtag #bbg (for Bikini Body Guide) and #bbgprogess, looping more and more women into the Itsines universe.\n\nLike getting toned abs, the process wasn\u2019t pain free. The app was in development for close to a year and was hundreds of thousands of dollars over budget when it went live in November 2015. What was meant to be a huge climax instead became bitter disappointment with some 25,000 complaints registered on the first day. The couple and their small team spent the next fortnight working day and night to fix bugs and glitches. When they relaunched a few weeks later, Sweat immediately climbed the charts and within a year became the top health app in the Apple Store, Pearce says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday there are 1 million active users per month, though Itsines and Pearce don\u2019t disclose how many of those are on the one-week free trial versus subscribers who pay $20 per month. Their company, Sweat, is on track to turn over $100 million this year. And like any good personal trainers they\u2019ve got some pretty impressive goals.\n\nBuilding scale means adding more trainers to the existing line-up, which includes US-based Kelsey Wells and yoga instructor Sjana Elise Earp, adding more programs and signing up more users. Itsines\u2019 10 million Instagram followers are prime candidates; Wells and Earp have a further 3.2 million between them. They are targeting 10 million monthly active subscribers within five years, and estimate they have a target market of 172 million women globally. Big private equity firms have circled. But so far, Itsines and Pearce have turned down all offers of external investment. They don\u2019t like the idea of ceding any control; they\u2019ve gotten this far on their own.\n\nOne of 10 women\n\nItsines is emblematic of the success that digitally savvy entrepreneurs can achieve when they hit on a trend early. Yet as a woman on the Young Rich List, she\u2019s a rare commodity, one of just 10 of the wealthiest self-made Australians aged 40 or under. Not only is the percentage of women on the Young Rich List stubbornly low; it\u2019s gone backwards. In 2003 when the list was created, 23 per cent, or 14 of its 61 members, were women.\n\nThe lack of female entrepreneurs hitting the big time is even more puzzling than the persistent lack of women sitting in the chief executive\u2019s office or in Parliament House. Women setting up their own businesses are not presented with the same handbrakes as their corporate counterparts \u2013 there isn\u2019t the bullying, sexism, gender pay disparity and an entrenched boys\u2019 club throwing up obstacles to being boss. They are the boss. So where are they?\n\nMelbourne executive Carol Schwartz, who holds board positions with the Reserve Bank of Australia and listed property group Stockland, has long advocated for higher representation of women in executive ranks. When asked about the lack of women on the Young Rich List, Schwartz thinks the main culprit is the world of finance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge structural issue in venture capital markets. A very small percentage of funds are invested in [female-owned] start-ups and that\u2019s a global phenomenon,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the same way that women don\u2019t receive the same opportunities for recruitment or promotion [in corporate Australia], women are subject to systemic bias. Men don\u2019t believe that a woman can build the same size company as a man. When men apply for VC investment, very often they are asked very different questions to women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen receive less\n\nIt\u2019s a contention that is backed up by a report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG), published in June, which found that when women business owners pitch their ideas to investors for early-stage capital they receive, on average, $US1 million ($1.4 million) less.\n\nAnd data from PitchBook \u2013 the M & A, private equity and VC database \u2013 shows that all-women start-ups attracted just 2 per cent of the $US85 billion invested by venture capitalists last year. All-male teams collected about 80 per cent, with the remainder flowing to mixed-gender management teams.\n\nIn trying to explain the gender investment gap, BCG found that women founders are subject to greater push-back when pitching. Men tend to overpitch with bold projections and assumptions, while women are far more conservative. One participant in the BCG study said when she pitched with her male partner, investors invariably directed technical questions to him.\n\nKate Morris remembers that when she was starting her online beauty product retailer, Adore Beauty, many men seemed bemused by her ambition. Perhaps they didn\u2019t realise how much women spend on moisturiser. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of men I speak to even now who don\u2019t really get it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey literally do not get the mindset of a female consumer.\u201d It was while working at a cosmetic counter that Morris realised many women find department stores intimidating. So, aged 21, she borrowed $12,000 from the parents of her boyfriend James Height, now her husband, and set up an online beauty store from her garage. She couldn\u2019t afford to pay someone to do the coding for her website, so she taught herself how to code.\n\nAlmost two decades later, Adore Beauty sells more than 200 brands from Aesop to Yves Saint Laurent, straddling skincare, make-up and fragrances. It\u2019s turning over an estimated $30 million annually and its success has put the pair, both aged 40, on the Young Rich List for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetworking is key\n\nTheir first big financing break came from a female mentor to Morris, who knew that Woolworths was looking to invest in a business like Adore Beauty. The supermarket giant would eventually take a 25 per cent stake (an investment Morris and Height bought back two years later in 2017).\n\n\u201cYou need to know the right people,\u201d Morris points out when asked why comparatively few women entrepreneurs succeed. \u201cI doubt it\u2019s deliberate but women don\u2019t have those connections and they are not invited to create them. There is still so much stuff happening on the golf course, I think that\u2019s pretty problematic. It is clubby and men don\u2019t seem to look around and say, \u2018hey most of the people I know are men, is that not quite right?\u2019\u201d\n\nBuilding the network needed to get funding is even harder if you have young children. Most networking opportunities, from informal catch-ups to business events, happen after working (and therefore childcare) hours. \u201cAll of these events happen at 6pm but if you have a young child you can\u2019t be going to an event at 6pm, or at the very least you need to have a partner who is willing to pause his networking efforts in order to enable you to go. And, unfortunately, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough men doing that, taking that equal responsibility,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThe person who is paid the most tends to put the least amount of effort into parenting and it all becomes self-reinforcing.\u201d\n\nThe couple have two children. On the day of a big warehouse move about two-and-a-half years ago, Morris went into labour. She was back at work after three weeks, a result of the couple deciding to share the load equally of building a family at the same time as they built a business.\n\n\u201cI would go to work in the morning and he would go in the afternoon,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s easier in your own business because you can make your own rules. I think of it as work-life integration rather than work-life balance. Balance is an unhealthy way of looking at things because it\u2019s as if there\u2019s some ideal way that it\u2019s supposed to be. Work is important to me. My family is important to me. I\u2019m going to find a way to make it work.\u201d\n\nWine and start-ups\n\nIt\u2019s knock-off time in Sydney. The sun sets as city workers make their way to Wynyard train station. Buses, cars and cabs choke York Street. But at one office building the human traffic is inbound. Young women are making their way to Fishburners, a tech start-up co-working space. They take the lift to level three, walk down a long corridor with open doorways revealing mostly young men \u2013 top buns, manicured beards and sneakers \u2013 hunched over laptops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of the corridor is a large room, its back wall adorned with silver balloons bearing the letters LMBDW. A table is lined with glasses and wine bottles \u2013 sparkling, sauvignon blanc, ros\u00e9 or shiraz. This is a pour-it-yourself function in an oh-so-start-up fashion.\n\nLike Minded Bitches Drinking Wine is a quarterly event where women share advice and hear from other women who\u2019ve established their own businesses. About 80 women attend, having paid $30 to cover the wine, cheese, sausage rolls and sliders. Half of the women say they want to launch a start-up. The other half already have. The energy is palpable.\n\nAttendees include ophthalmology surgeon Alina Zeldovich, who spends her hours outside of practice with a female ophthalmologist friend on their business, Beamers. It makes UV protection sunglasses for kids to help prevent eye problems. Zeldovich wants to learn how to grow her business.\n\nLike Minded Bitches Drinking Wine is the brainchild of Young Rich Lister Jane Lu, founder of fashion online retailer Showpo, and her friend, entrepreneur Gen George. The pair initially gathered 20 women for dinner to kick around ideas and seek advice from others on challenges they were facing in their businesses. It proved popular, so the duo opened it up to anyone who cared to join. Without any advertising, they\u2019ve amassed 85,000 members in 25 cities worldwide.\n\nLu knows all about managing one\u2019s self-doubt. She wasn\u2019t initially brave enough to tell her parents, who\u2019d migrated to Australia from China, that she\u2019d packed in her safe job at top-tier consultancy EY to have a crack at fashion retailing by creating Showpo. Before it got off the ground she was given plenty of reasons to doubt herself. \u201cWhen I quit my job I was told I was an idiot,\u201d says Lu. \u201cWhat do you know about fashion? What do you know about retail? What do you know about starting a business?\n\n\u201cWomen question themselves a lot more and wait for things to be perfect before starting. They may think, what if I lose money? What if I look stupid? What if I quit my job and then have to look for another one?\u201d But Lu backed herself; for her, the bigger risk was in not having tried to start a business at all. Showpo generates about $30 million a year in revenue.\n\nThe women clutching their wine glasses at the LMBDW event are full of optimism. After another glass of ros\u00e9, everything\u2019s possible. But there\u2019s only so far that sisters can do it for themselves. Eventually they\u2019ll need to get financial backing. And that\u2019s where gender really comes into play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolving problems\n\nEntrepreneurs are at their heart, problem solvers. Like authors often write fiction from their own experience, entrepreneurs tend to create businesses that stem from their own frustrations that things can or should be done differently.\n\nMany women featuring on the Young Rich List are predominantly in businesses making money from other women \u2013 Itsines with Sweat, Morris with Adore Beauty. Fellow debutant Alarna Longes once worked as a receptionist at a beauty clinic while attempting to pursue a media career. Noticing the clinic in a tiny medical centre was booked out every day, she instead teamed up with Dr Philippa McCaffery to establish Clearskincare Clinics, offering everything from acne treatments to dermal fillers. It would grow to 44 sites across Australia and New Zealand before getting snapped up by listed Australian Pharmaceutical Industries, the owner of Priceline, for $127.4 million in June.\n\nYet when women need capital to grow their businesses, they are often talking to a room filled with men who have little experience with the product or service being pitched to them. When AFR Magazine approached two venture capital firms for an interview, the male partners of each included female executives in the discussion. Blackbird Ventures partner Niki Scevak concedes he\u2019s embarrassed at the state of affairs, blaming his industry\u2019s unconscious bias and self-reinforcing networks. \u201cThere is the danger of an echo chamber,\u201d he says.\n\nGraphic\n\nIndeed, for evidence of that, you need look no further than Blackbird\u2019s own website, which tells budding entrepeneurs the VC fund takes \u201cfar more notice of founders introduced to us by people we trust, whether they be founders we have invested in, angel investors we have co-invested with or people we have worked with. So please, try to network to find a warm introduction.\u201d\n\nScevak says Blackbird is broadening its network by employing and engaging more women in its operations. \u201cWe are approaching things differently. We need more female investment partners, more female mentors so that we can invest in more female-led companies,\u201d he says.\n\nSamantha Wong joined Blackbird as a partner in 2015. She agrees that some men can\u2019t relate to female-focused business ideas, dismissing them as too niche or too nascent when, in fact, they simply don\u2019t have a clue. But just as important is the lack of women who study STEM, and hence lack skills in technology, she says. Financiers are more likely to back a business whose founders can build their own products, believing they iterate faster and burn less cash than founders who need to outsource the tech to others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreaking the mould\n\nPaul Bassat is a former Young Rich Lister, debuting on the inaugural list in 2003 after establishing jobs website SEEK with his brother Andrew. Now he\u2019s backing other budding entrepeneurs at Square Peg Capital, which counts design company Canva and small-business lender Prospa among its investments.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing as many female entrepreneurs as we would like to; if you look at the broad statistics it\u2019s not as high as we would like it,\u201d Bassat says. But he argues Australia is doing far better than its global peers. Of Square Peg\u2019s 18 Australian investments, eight have a woman as a co-founder. Three are founded by women only. Bassat is confident change is happening. Square Peg has hired five women on its 17-member team in the past 16 months, including Imogen Baxter who works with budding entrepreneurs to understand the investment process. \u201cVC firms are much more aware of the accessibility issue so they have hired people like me to be a friendly in-between,\u201d Baxter says.\n\nA survey in October by The Australian Financial Review found that of the 448 investments made by the country\u2019s top 10 VC funds, 35 per cent had female co-founders, up from 26 per cent the year prior. And it makes business sense. In BCG\u2019s assessment of start-up performance spanning five years, companies founded or co-founded by women were generating 10 per cent more in cumulative revenue. For every dollar of funding, start-ups founded or co-founded by women generated 78\u00a2, versus 31\u00a2 for male-led start-ups.\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps why there\u2019s also been pressure from heavy-hitter investors. The push for change, which began in earnest five years ago, involved countering venture capital\u2019s image as demanding long, inflexible hours. \u201cWe had to tell people that as asset owners you are the one others work around,\u201d says Yasser El-Ansary, chief executive of the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCAL). \u201cYou can play a significant role in deciding when meetings are held and when you can travel. You can call the shots. It is a flexible role \u2013 if you can\u2019t have a board meeting at a certain time, you say you can\u2019t.\u201d Some firms told recruiters they wanted only women on the short list of potential hires.\n\nEl-Ansary agrees that by encouraging more women to the industry, more female entrepreneurs will find funding. \u201cI would expect that in five years\u2019 time Australia will be home to a higher proportion of successful female entrepreneurs helped by our industry.\u201d\n\nIn January 2014 she bit the bullet and, with Pearce, sketched out her workouts to create an e-book, the Bikini Body Guide. It was so successful it was downloaded illegally more than 1m times. Damian Bennett\n\nFemale start-ups growing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of appetite. About a quarter of the country\u2019s start-ups are now founded by women, up from 16 per cent four years ago, according to Startup Muster. This new crop of women will be trying to achieve their dreams with more support than the generation that went before them. Kate Morris is one of those working on giving back \u2013 creating a scholarship for women studying computer science.\n\nThen there are investors such as Bill Bates and Ben Hodson. Both have two daughters and both talk of wanting to make sure they will have every opportunity that was afforded to them. They\u2019re backers of Scale Investors, an investment firm set up by Carol Schwartz, Susan Oliver and Annette Kimmitt in 2013, aimed at backing female-led start-ups.\n\nScale\u2019s chief executive, Ariane Barker, spent 20 years in the male-dominated investment banking industry and in that time experienced plenty of unconscious and conscious bias. She says female founders can find it intimidating presenting to male-dominated panels throwing off a lot of financial jargon. Scale works with would-be founders to explain the process of investing to help them avoid pitfalls and be as polished as possible before turning up to pitch to investors.\n\nInstead of asking women why they will succeed, they are asked how Scale can help them succeed.\n\nAre quotas needed?\n\nEntrepreneur Janine Allis was one of the few women to debut on the inaugural Young Rich List 15 years ago with her Boost Juice business. It\u2019s since gone global and is one of four brands within her Retail Zoo empire, now majority owned by Bain Capital. She\u2019s upbeat. Change is, to her, inevitable.\n\n\u201cWhen my grandmother got married she wasn\u2019t allowed to work,\u201d Allis recalls. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t that long ago. So that\u2019s what we have come from. It\u2019s a generation thing. I think for my kids, it\u2019s not even going to be a thing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say she doesn\u2019t think some prodding is needed. She\u2019s a believer in quotas for boards, reversing an earlier view that it should be on merit alone. Quotas, she believes, will drive the generational shift. \u201cI believe quotas are something we actually need to consider. I never would have thought I would say it but I think it will make a difference. Businesses that have a more diverse mix on boards are more profitable businesses. They just are. The numbers don\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA big dose of good publicity doesn\u2019t hurt either. Bassat says the profile of young entrepreneurs such as Itsines and Melanie Perkins from Canva, who declined to be interviewed for this story, will be invaluable for future generations of female entrepreneurs. \u201cIf you look at Kayla and you look at Melanie, it is really important that they be role models as much as possible. They are going to inspire. I think sometimes in Australian business we are a little bit humble and modest and we don\u2019t want to put ourselves out there, but I think that for people like Kayla there\u2019s a really important reason why she should be putting herself out there. And that is because she is going to inspire others: if a young woman from Adelaide can build this amazing, successful business, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nJane Lu, ShowPo founder and No. 32 on the 2018 Young Rich List. Fairfax Media\n\nItsines sure has made the big league, and has no intention of leaving South Australia; indeed she and Pearce own more than 12 investment properties there. Reflecting on her success, Itsines wishes she knew earlier that anything was possible. \u201cIn Adelaide you are not told you have the opportunity to be a superstar. If I was to grow up somewhere like New York, everyone there is very confident and everyone wants to make it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I could change anything, I would talk about the opportunity of being an entrepreneur in schools. I didn\u2019t even know what that word meant in school. I was, what is that word? Oh you know, someone who goes off and does their own thing. I was, what?\u201d\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue is out on Friday October 26 inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram\n\nAdore Beauty co-founder Kate Morris: \u201cYou need to know the right people.\u201d Kristoffer Paulsen\n\nThe cover of the AFR Magazine's November issue.
