The hospital director of the hospital, where he was first taken after the incident, told reporters that the minister's blood pressure and pulse were \"normal\", meaning \"he did not suffer from interal bleeding\".\n\nHowever, Wiranto was immediately airlifted to Jakarta's Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he reportedly received emergency surgery.\n\nWiranto was taken to Jakarta by helicopter after he was attacked in Banten on Thursday [Weli Ayu Rejeki/Antara via Reuters]\n\nBudi, the intelligence chief, told reporters on Thursday that JAD members, including the suspects in Wiranto's attack, had been on law enforcement radar for at least three months.\n\nJakarta Globe quoted Budi as saying that the main suspect, Syahril Alamsyah, had moved from the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi, to Bogor in West Java. After divorcing his first wife, he moved again to the town of Pandeglang, where Wiranto's stabbing took place.\n\nThe suspect reportedly received help from another JAD member, Abu Samsudin, when he moved to Pandeglang.\n\n'Opportunistic' attacks\n\nBudi, however, conceded that it was difficult to know what each JAD member was planning to do, because they could be operating independently, or in small groups.\n\n\"They move (through) the cell system, and the cells are very small,\" Budi said.\n\nIn the case of Wiranto's attacker, Budi said that he was \"definite\" that the JAD group from Bekasi was involved.\n\nThe head of JAD in Bekasi also reportedly officiated the attacker's marriage to his new wife, who was also arrested after Thursday's attack.\n\n\"We have been monitoring this particular actor specifically,\" Budi told reporters.\n\nBut he did not explain how the suspect evaded Wiranto's security.\n\nSidney Jones of IPAC said that many of the JAD members' actions were \"very opportunistic\", and it could be that they found the chance when they learned of Wiranto's visit to Pandeglang, about 2 and half hours drive west of Jakarta.\n\nChief Inspector General Tomsi Tohir, police chief of Banten province, was quoted by news reports as saying that while security protocols had been followed \"in accordance with standard procedures\", it was difficult to prevent Wiranto from interacting with the public, as the minister had insisted.\n\n\"Security had been arranged, but he was intent on greeting the waiting crowd. On his return, we also provided security, but he wanted to meet them, because there were many school children; some wanted to shake hands with him,\" Tomsi was quoted as saying.\n\nIt was during this time that the suspect managed to get close enough to Wiranto to stab him.\n\nAside from Wiranto and the local police chief, a third person was also reportedly injured as the crowd tried to wrestle the suspect to the ground.\n\nWith additional reporting by Febriana Firdaus in Indonesia", "description": "Indonesia-based Jamaah Anshurat Daulah was also linked to 2018 church bombings in Surabaya and the 2016 Jakarta attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/0bc39bfb52fd401a8e994744a964a06e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
