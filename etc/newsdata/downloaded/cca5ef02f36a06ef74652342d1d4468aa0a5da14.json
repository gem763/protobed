(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nIt\u2019s easy to talk about social and political issues if your audience mostly agrees.\n\nCall it the power of an echo chamber.\n\nWhich means that when the NBA brass decided to brand itself as a supporter of the freedom of expression it encouraged among its general managers, coaches and players, the league wasn\u2019t risking much. The folks who were likely to disagree with the political opinions of, say, LeBron James or Gregg Popovich, weren\u2019t going to be watching or buying tickets anyway \u2014 the NBA\u2019s fan base leans left-center.\n\nThis week, an employee of an NBA team stepped outside the echo chamber. Turns out supporting human rights has a price, even for the most \u201cprogressive\u201d sports league in the country.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver arrives for a news conference before an NBA preseason basketball game between the Houston Rockets and the Toronto Raptors Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2019, in Saitama, near Tokyo.

Look at its shoddy treatment of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey.\n\nAt issue is Morey's tweet last week supporting protesters in Hong Kong: \u201cfight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nWell, the Chinese government didn\u2019t like it. Which means Chinese companies who do business with the NBA didn\u2019t like it. Which means Chinese citizens didn\u2019t like it, or so we\u2019re told by the Chinese government.\n\nWhether actual citizens in that NBA-loving country balked is beside the point. They don\u2019t control whether games air on television. Media outfits such as Tencent do, a Chinese company that happens to have a $1.5 billion deal with the NBA to air league content.\n\nAfter Morey\u2019s tweet, Tencent announced it would not air Rockets games. And the Chinese Basketball Association, headed by former Rockets center Yao Ming, immediately cut ties with the organization.\n\nIn an authoritarian state, these moves were designed to appease the government. We may not like it. But this is China\u2019s business.\n\nFILE - In this Sept. 4, 2019, file photo, Yao Ming, head of the Chinese Basketball Association and former NBA player, watches as China and Venezeula compete during their group phase basketball game in the FIBA Basketball World Cup at the Cadillac Arena in Beijing.

Yet China\u2019s reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet has led to a kind of censorship on American soil.\n\nConsider this quote from Adam Silver, the league\u2019s commissioner, who told CNN last year that \"I think part of the reason NBA players are more active is that it's been part of the culture of this league for generations and passed down to them ... (the) sense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important (is) part of being an NBA player.\"\n\nThose words sound hollow now, especially after the league issued a statement that called Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cregrettable,\u201d though he wasn\u2019t the only one from the league to acquiesce to the Chinese government.\n\nMasked protesters march in Hong Kong on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019.

(Photo: Vincent Thian, AP)\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta was quick to tweet that Morey didn\u2019t speak for the team. And Rockets star James Harden eagerly told reporters that he loved China, and loved playing there.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to pick on Harden. The shooting guard felt the heat from the team\u2019s owner \u2014 or governor, as they\u2019re now called \u2014 and sensed a sudden shift from the league about expressing opinions. Besides, the unease extended far beyond Texas.\n\nIn San Francisco, the normally opinionated Warriors coach, Steve Kerr, refrained from comment, saying he wasn\u2019t well-versed enough on the subject of the Hong Kong protests. That\u2019s fine. Give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut he surely sensed the hypocrisy coming from the league and could not have been happy with the way Morey was treated. Still, he stayed quiet.\n\nConservative politicians took notice. U.S. senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) slammed the NBA for its hypocrisy and for putting media contracts and potential markets above human rights.\n\nIn fact, so upsetting was the NBA\u2019s response that politicians on the left agreed. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Beto O\u2019Rourke issued blistering statements as well.\n\nAn activist takes part in a protest in Hong Kong, on Aug. 20, 2019. (Photo: ROMAN PILIPEY, EPA-EFE)\n\nBoth sides are right. China\u2019s record on human rights is atrocious. And the NBA wants it both ways: to sell itself as an inclusive, progressive bastion while making barrels of money with the help of an authoritarian regime.\n\nThe league isn\u2019t the only company facing the conundrum of doing business with China. And perhaps the reaction to the NBA\u2019s mealy mouthed response will bring attention to the failed promise of Western capitalism loosening up a totalitarian state. After all, Google, Apple and other companies have been selling parts of their souls for years.\n\nYet at least those companies haven\u2019t marketed themselves as moral watchdogs like the NBA has. Again, it\u2019s easy to speak out when a couple of billion dollars aren\u2019t at stake. And easy to brand yourself as a beacon of free expression when there isn\u2019t fear of losing several hundred million customers.\n\nWell, this week we saw what happened when the NBA stared down that threat. It blinked. Though at least the league realized what its response meant for its brand back home.\n\nSilver released another statement Tuesday:\n\n\u201cI recognize our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for. Let me be more clear \u2026 for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business. Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so \u2026 the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nFor the several days, though, it did. The league\u2019s initial response went against everything it said it stood for. The backtracking in the latest statement from Silver may be sincere and heartfelt. It also may be the kind of cynical, circle-the-wagons reaction we saw from the NFL a few years ago when kneeling during the national anthem began to alienate a large portion of its fan base.\n\nWherever the NBA-China relationship goes from here, the league lost its high ground to the NFL and every other sports league in our country. In the end, it\u2019s always about business. We can safely be certain of that.", "description": "The NBA's hypocrisy is evident in how it handled Daryl Morey's tweet on Hong Kong, its apology to China, then backtracking, Shawn Windsor writes.", "authors": ["Shawn Windsor", "Published P.M.
