Though ostensibly a functional garment, the bathing suit has long been so much more, particularly as it pertains to female bodies. Jantzen proved it could be both functional and fashionable, and helped turn swimming into an appealing \u2014 and acceptable \u2014 sport for women.\n\nEventually, other companies took up the mantle. Speedo is now the world\u2019s best-selling swim brand. China makes 70 percent of all swimsuits. Jantzen itself was bought by a multinational manufacturing giant, Perry Ellis International, and then sold to a private company in 2019. Last year, Stamie\u2019s in Daytona Beach finally closed, after more than five decades on the boardwalk, and the Diving Girl statue was taken down and shipped to Washington State for storage.\n\nThe Diving Girl comes home\n\nCulturally and geographically speaking, you can\u2019t get farther away in America from Portland, than Daytona Beach, home to NASCAR\u2019s Daytona 500, endless water parks, and spring-breakers racing dune buggies on its 23 miles of hard-packed beach. They\u2019re even in opposite corners of the country. But Jantzen is a bridge. When the Red Diving Girl was taken down, Daytona Beach residents protested. \u201cPlease let her be where she belongs,\u201d they said. \u201cA Florida visit isn\u2019t complete without her.\u201d \u201cSave a piece of my history and my youth.\u201d City leaders rallied together, a rarity; the city\u2019s newspaper received a deluge of nostalgic letters and pictures, with a \u201cBring Back the Jantzen Girl\u201d campaign; social media exploded: #JantzenGirlDaytonaBeach. Originally from somewhere else, the Diving Girl had come to represent something intensely local.\n\nAnd so, last winter, the not-so-little Diving Girl took one last cross-country road trip. It took six days on a truck to get the 20-foot behemoth back home to Daytona. She was restored and feted with fireworks at a New Year\u2019s Eve bash, and reinstalled above a plaza at the One Daytona entertainment complex.", "description": "The modern American bathing suit was born in Portland, Ore., and a swim in the Willamette River offers a dip into history.", "authors": ["Bonnie Tsui"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/travel/04portland-oregon-swimming5/04portland-oregon-swimming5-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
