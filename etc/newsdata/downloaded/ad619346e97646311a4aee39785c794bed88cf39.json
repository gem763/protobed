Alfallaj was convicted and sentenced to more than 12 years in prison for failing to disclose his ties to al-Qaeda when applying for a nonimmigrant visa to come to the U.S.\n\nIn late 2011, Alfallaj arrived in the U.S. after the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency approved him for a nonimmigrant visa solely because his wife had come to the country on a foreign student visa.\n\nAlfallaj falsely claimed in federal paperwork that he had never supported terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and had no connections to terrorist networks in his native region. After being approved to enter the U.S., Alfallaj started attending flight school in Oklahoma, an identical routine to the 9/11 terrorists who came to the country on nonimmigrant visas and attended flight school.\n\nIt was not until February 2018 that Alfallaj was taken into federal custody by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after they discovered that his fingerprints were found all over an application to an al-Qaeda training camp.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, 15 of Alfallaj\u2019s fingerprints were found on applications for the \u201cal Farooq\u201d terrorist training camp, which was a central hub for terrorists to be trained leading up to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nAlfallaj pleaded guilty to the charges in December 2018, admitting that he fraudulently obtained his nonimmigrant visa to enter the U.S. Now, he will spend more than 12 years in prison before being deported to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, there are currently more than 10,000 illegal aliens living in the U.S. who are from countries designated by the State Department as being sponsors of terrorism, including Syria, Sudan, and Iran. Similarly, the Diversity Visa Lottery \u2014 which randomly gives out 55,000 visas every year \u2014 has imported nearly 30,000 foreign nationals from state-sponsors of terrorism to the country since 2007.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
