They married in 1987, and divorced in 2000 after growing apart.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Moore writes that Willis thought her acting career took time away from their family, and he reportedly told her he wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to be married.\n\nDespite that friction, Moore writes, \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to say, but I\u2019m very proud of our divorce.\u201d\n\nRumer Willis, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Scout Willis, Emma Heming Willis and Tallulah Willis | Stefanie Keenan/Getty More\n\nMoore admits the split \u201cwasn\u2019t easy at first, but we managed to move the heart of our relationship, the heart of what created our family, into something new that gave the girls a loving, supportive environment with both parents.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Moore says, \u201cWe felt more connected than we did before the divorce.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Demi Moore Writes About Addiction, Marriages to Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher in New Memoir\n\nBruce Willis and Demi Moore in 1988 | Ron Galella/WireImage More\n\nMoore and Willis have remained on strong terms since the split.
