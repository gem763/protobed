She smiled at me like the Joker.\n\nI don't think I even sat down. I fled. Cosmetic procedures, I concluded, were not for me.\n\nBut the fact that I went and shied away at the last minute means I get it.\n\nI understand why women want to lift and fill and sculpt their faces and bodies, like Ingrid Tarrant, who wrote here last week about wanting a facelift and lipo on her knees after seeing herself on TV. (Knees? About the one part of my body that's holding up!)\n\nScroll down for video\n\nIngrid Tarrant wrote about wanting a facelift and lipo on her knees after seeing herself on TV\n\nThe pressure on women to look a certain way is intense, and it starts young.\n\nA survey last week revealed a quarter of today's girls self-harm (compared to one in ten boys) and a lot of this is ascribed to anxiety about appearance.\n\n'Worries about how they look are a big issue, especially for girls,' said Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society.\n\nIt's so much harder now to escape this pernicious pressure.\n\nWhen I was young, there were healthy supermodels (as well as the usual skeletons) on the catwalk, but the difference between then and now is total.\n\nThe images of the impossible shape you wished you were didn't appear on a live feed on your phone or on your home page all day and all night, for you to compare your sorry self to.\n\nYou did your best to accept what your mother said: that nobody liked everything about themselves, and that we all came in different shapes and sizes.\n\nBut now that acceptance and embrace of the wonky, flawed, imperfect human condition has been forgotten, and a belief that everything can be fixed and improved has taken its place. And it is costing lives.\n\nLast week a British woman died after a Brazilian butt-lift in Turkey went wrong.\n\nRachel Johnson says the pressure on women to look a certain way is intense, and it starts young. File photo\n\nThis has become a popular procedure as it siphons the fat from your waist and loins to help furnish you with a sticky-out apple-bottom booty, as worn by the Kardashian Klan.\n\nLeah Cambridge was only 29 and 'unhappy' with her body after having three kids. She died after having three heart attacks on the operating table.\n\nFigures suggest that one in 3,000 patients who undergo this treatment die when a fat embolism enters the bloodstream during the surgery, and is carried to their lungs.\n\nHow have we come to this: women risking their lives to conform to an entirely unnatural and genetically impossible notion of beauty?\n\nThe celebrities who have encouraged it have blood on their hands.\n\nLeah Cambridge, 29, died after a Brazilian butt-lift surgery in Turkey went wrong\n\nI find it outrageous, for example, that so many of the contestants on this year's Love Island admitted they availed themselves of cheap 'procedures' in Turkey (where a butt-lift costs about \u00a33,000, as opposed to \u00a310,000 in the UK) and elsewhere to pump, whiten, enhance themselves, and then advertised the extraordinary and freakish results to their impressionable mass young audience.\n\nThat's far more shocking, frankly, than the fact that a size 26 'body confidence' model and campaigner, Tess Holliday, is gracing the cover of October's Cosmo, driving fat-shamers into fury.\n\nCalm down, dears. She is an organic, natural, big and beautiful woman. Her cover story is a cool two-fingers up to the twin cults of tyranny (youth and beauty) that can dominate \u2013 and destroy \u2013 lives.\n\nOf course, being too fat is as unhealthy as being too thin.\n\nBut seeing that arresting cover, any female \u2013 fat or thin, young or old \u2013 can take comfort that not everyone has to look like Kate Moss/Kim Kardashian, or has to tootle off to Turkey to spend thousands on a plastic surgery safari in an attempt to achieve it.\n\nI should admit at this point that I've contemplated reconstructive surgery myself. But this was only after I broke my nose for the second time.\n\nThe report from Barry Jones MS FRCS read that I have 'a septum deviated into the right airway and distortion of the nasal structure and a noticeable midvault prominence'. That's a polite way of saying hooked beak.\n\nBack then, I was too scared to have a nose job. But when I mentioned to a TV colleague that I watched myself on screen in high-definition through splayed fingers, she tipped the best specialist for a\u2026 subtle refresh. That's how I came to be sitting in that clinic.\n\nI bolted from the waiting room with frown lines and wrinkles still in place, as well as witchy nose, and I'm glad I did.\n\nAs I tell myself every year on my birthday (to stop myself blubbing with self-pity): You may well frighten the horses on and off screen, but you will never be again as young as you are today, so for goodness sake do try to enjoy it, woman.\n\nLaura's worth fighting for\n\nBrits abroad after drinking for eight hours straight on a lads' holiday \u2013 it was always going to kick off. Inevitable.\n\n'We had a long debate about Brexit and this led to a conversation about Laura Kuenssberg,' explained a witness to the bar-room fisticuffs that followed.\n\nOne leading surgeon (with an aspirant journalist daughter) punched a fellow doctor who'd argued LK, right, wasn't pretty enough to be on TV, had a 'lopsided smile', and should only speak with a bag over her head.\n\nIf I'd been in the Spanish bar, I'd also have been tempted to punch the doctor's lights out. LK is the BBC's first female political editor. She is a superb and tireless broadcaster.\n\nAdmire her irrelevant 'asymmetrical' looks or not \u2013 and I do \u2013 but she is the most magnificent role model, not just for young women but for very well-refreshed middle-aged professionals who should know better too.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex has been crowned Girl of the Year in Tatler\u2019s October issue, which hits shops tomorrow. The society mag warbles that she has \u2018that indefinable, unmissable quality that makes [her] the one for whom heads turn\u2026 and with whom everyone \u2013 but everyone \u2013 is desperate to be, right here, right now, and forever\u2019. The issue combs through past nominees and also name-checks the Duchess of Cornwall and the Queen. Girls? Girls!? Even Meghan is a reasonably ripe woman of 37!", "description": "'Rachel Johnson,\u2019 the receptionist at the clinic for \u2018deluxe skincare and aesthetics\u2019 at last called.
