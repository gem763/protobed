I raced to the radio and listened in disbelief to the opening bars of \u201cConversation in the Mountains,\u201d a piece I had written that incorporated spoken passages of a prose poem by Paul Celan about a missed encounter between two wanderers on an alpine road.\n\nAs the show unfolded, it quickly became apparent that Mr. Schaefer had done what made \u201cNew Sounds\u201d so invaluable: he stitched together a riveting and enlightening program \u2014 this one, called \u201cPoetry and Music,\u201d featured pieces that used only spoken, not sung, text \u2014 out of wildly disparate music. With its mixture of theremin, violin, clarinet, marimba, lap steel guitar, spoken text, and rock rhythm section, \u201cConversation in the Mountains,\u201d had, I thought, existed in its own isolated musical world.\n\nYet as Mr. Schaefer\u2019s selections during the show unspooled (the Scottish singer-songwriter Robin Williamson played harp while half-speaking a Dylan Thomas poem; the avant-garde cellist Frances-Marie Uitti played luscious drones, accompanied by the writer Paul Griffiths reciting randomized words from Ophelia\u2019s speeches in \u201cHamlet;\u201d the bassist Bill Laswell and his collective, Material, fashioned an ominous groove as the canvas for narration by William S. Burroughs) it seemed to me that the host had forged a new genre out of nothing more than an astonishing memory and a boundless musical curiosity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to hear music and not think what it could go with,\u201d Mr. Schaefer explained to me recently over the phone. \u201cMy desk is littered with little scraps of paper with the beginnings of ideas for shows.\u201d", "description": "The show\u2019s host, John Schaefer, has long championed music that gets little airplay elsewhere.", "authors": ["Dan Kaufman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/opinion/18kaufmanWeb/18kaufmanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
