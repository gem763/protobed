The big question is: will sharing everything affect your credit score?\n\nWell, according to TransUnion, our credit scores don\u2019t suddenly merge. Even if your spouse has a negative credit history, it won\u2019t initially affect your credit score in any way.\n\nSo, when does your spouse\u2019s credit rating start affecting yours?\n\nThe consumer credit reporting agency says the changes only come after you\u2019re married or you decide to jointly apply for credit products like loans or credit cards. \u201cCredit providers will look at both of your incomes, which may make it easier to apply for loans. They will also look at both of your credit scores \u2013 and if one of you has a bad credit history, there\u2019s a chance your application won\u2019t be approved or they may charge a higher interest rate.\u201d\n\nWhat do you do when your spouse has a poor credit rating?\n\nIf you and your spouse have different credit scores, this may affect any joint applications for credit and may even put a damper on the new renovation ideas that you have. In this case, says TransUnion, you will have to decide on who will handle applying for credit and loans. \u201cWill the spouse with better credit score make the applications? Will you apply jointly and accept higher interest rates to improve the other spouse\u2019s score? These are questions you have to ask, depending on your financial situation and priorities,\u201d says the agency.\n\nDoes my marriage contract affect my credit rating?\n\nAccording to TransUnion, your marriage contract doesn\u2019t affect your credit rating or how you are assessed for a loan, however, it does affect who is responsible for the debt. So, if you\u2019re married in community of property, it means you and your partner are equally and fully responsible for any debts incurred while you\u2019re married. \u201cIn other words, if you can\u2019t pay your debts, your creditors can legally recover the money from your spouse. If you have an ante-nuptial contract, only the primary account holder is legally responsible for paying any debts,\u201d says the consumer credit reporting agency.\n\nIf we have joint credit, how is this recorded at a credit bureau?\n\nA joint account is reflected on the credit records of both you and your spouse. \u201cThat information is kept on the joint account until it is settled: the type of account; the people responsible for the debt; your opening balance; your current balance; the number of instalments, instalment amount and repayment frequency; months in arrears and overdue balance,\u201d says TransUnion.\n\nWhat if we miss a joint credit payment?\n\n\u201cIf you default on a joint account payment, this information will reflect as a default or judgement on both of your credit records,\u201d the agency explains.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 finance apps to help you manage your finances\n\nWhat if I co-sign a contract for my spouse?\n\n\u201cYou need to be very clear on what you\u2019re getting into, when you co-sign on a loan or a credit card, you take on legal responsibility for that account, and it appears as your obligation on your credit report,\u201d TransUnion advises.\n\nIf your spouse misses payments or dodges paying the loan, your credit reports will be affected \u2013 and the creditor may unfortunately require you to settle the debt.\n\nHow do I take my name off a loan if our relationship ends?\n\n\u201cOnce the account is opened, it\u2019s extremely difficult to remove a co-signer off the loan. The person keeping the account will need to show the bank that they are able to take over the loan, or close it, to end the co-signing agreement,\u201d says TransUnion.\n\nApparently not even a divorce decree will relieve you of your liability to the creditor, unless the creditor themselves releases you from that account.\n\nSo, what can you do to protect yourself?\n\nAccording to the agency, if you have a joint loan or have co-signed on a loan, check your credit report regularly to see how the other person is maintaining the account. \u201cThat way, you can address any potential problems early to avoid an issue on your own credit rating down the line,\u201d says TransUnion.", "description": "Getting married changes a lot of things in your life, including finances", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9298/d05651bdef0d4cd9af1037256b5c940b.png", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
