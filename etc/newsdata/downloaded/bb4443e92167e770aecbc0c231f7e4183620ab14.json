(AP) \u2014 A rural Nevada county approved strict guidelines Tuesday for a pair of festivals later this month in a desolate desert area well-known by UFO and alien hunters.\n\nLincoln County commissioners took the action amid concern about the possibility of unmanageable crowds attracted by an internet hoax dubbed \u201cStorm Area 51\u201d involving the nearby military installation that has been the focus of UFO conspiracy theories.\n\nThe plan adopted by the commission involves a music festival for 5,000 people in tiny Hiko, and projections by Connie West, owner of the Little A\u2019le\u2019Inn motel in Rachel for as many as 10,000 people camping on her property for another event in the town closest to Area 51.\n\nEvent organizers said there needs to be food, water and entertainment on hand to help people survive in the desert that\u2019s a nearly three-hour drive from Las Vegas. Most conceded that cellphone service could be overwhelmed.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She also plans to collect parking fees to pay for security and medical personnel, and turn away people who bring guns or drugs to her event dubbed \u201cAlienstock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m elated and shaking inside,\u201d West told reporters outside Lincoln County Courthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s all laying on my shoulders because someone said, \u2018Hey, meet me in Rachel.\u2019 Now it\u2019s realer than ever.\u201d\n\nCommissioners and neighbors said they didn\u2019t really want the events or the attention the internet hoax has drawn to the county of 5,200 residents in an area the size of Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see our desert trashed,\u201d resident Desma Auclair said.\n\nJoerg Arnu, a Rachel resident, said he was unhappy to learn a helicopter pad is planned near his home.\n\nHarris and Keith Wright, producer of the musical event slated for Hiko, said they have planned carefully and do not want people to trespass on Area 51.\n\nOn Tuesday, they presented aerial photos of the site and said they\u2019ll announce performers in coming days.\n\nWright said portable toilets, water, food, trash bins and security staff would all be trucked in.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is, people just have to be respectful and everyone will have a good time,\u201d Commissioner Bevan Lister said about plans for the Sept. 20-22 events.\n\nLincoln and neighboring Nye counties have both prepared emergency declarations to seek state help if needed.\n\nLast week, the Nye County Commission denied a permit for an event there that organizers had dubbed \u201cPeacestock 51.\u201d\n\nLincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said Tuesday that more than 150 law enforcement officers would be available during the events. He said Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak promised Nevada Guard units for logistical help.\n\nLee and county Commissioner Varlin Higbee said people would be arrested if they approached the gates of Area 51.\n\n\u201cIt could be ugly or it could be decent,\u201d Commissioner Keith Pearson concluded.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Guidelines were approved Tuesday for a pair of festivals later this month in a desolate desert area well-known to UFO and alien hunters.", "authors": ["Ken Ritter"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19246785799977.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
