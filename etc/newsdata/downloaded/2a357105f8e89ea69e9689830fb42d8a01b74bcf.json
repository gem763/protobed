The parliamentary budget office says it would cost the government $40 million starting in 2020-21 and $71 million by 2028-29.\n\nScheer said the Conservatives will release their full platform before the start of advance polling days, which kick off Oct. 11. The Liberals unveiled their platform on Sunday, while the NDP released its document back in June.\n\nScheer made Monday's announcement in the riding once held by the late Jim Flaherty, who was federal finance minister under Stephen Harper. Flaherty was a passionate advocate along with his wife, current Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott, for the disability community.\n\nFlaherty and Elliott were instrumental in helping build the Abilities Centre, where Scheer made Monday's announcement.\n\nThe National's face-to-face interviews\n\nCBC is hosting a series of face-to-face interviews between undecided voters and federal leaders campaigning for next month's election.\n\nHow to watch:\n\nWatch the interviews on CBC News Network starting at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWatch on the CBC News App or CBC Gem at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWatch on The National at 10 p.m. on CBC TV across the country.", "description": "Andrew Scheer is promising that a Conservative government led by him would make it easier for thousands of Canadians to access the federal disability tax credit.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302784.1569873986!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-senate-20190929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
