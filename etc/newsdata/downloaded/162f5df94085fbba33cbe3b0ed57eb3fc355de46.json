Zach\u2019s boss (Will Ferrell) goes into damage-control mode by forcing him to travel across the country with his posse to get ten more episodes, thus birthing a carousel of very game (if not wildly confused) celebrity interviewees, including Keanu Reeves, Paul Rudd, \u201chot idiot\u201d Jon Hamm, David Letterman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tiffany Haddish, and a ready-to-cheat Chrissy Teigen. It premieres September 20 on Netflix.\n\nRelated", "description": "Zach Galifianakis stars in the trailer for Between Two Ferns: The Movie, which will appear on Netflix later this fall.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/04-between-two-ferns.w1200.h630.jpg"}
