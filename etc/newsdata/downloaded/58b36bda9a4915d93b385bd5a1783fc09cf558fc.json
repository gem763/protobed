This isn\u2019t healthy. I don\u2019t find it healthy to swim in Parkinson\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a lot of things as well as that,\u2019 he said (Picture: PA)\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, he admitted that some days Parkinson\u2019s is \u2018the first thing I think about when I wake up\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And then you can\u2019t get out of bed. You have to get your wife to pull you out. But some mornings, I think about it the second \u2013 they\u2019re good days,\u2019 he shared.\n\n\u2018And you always manage to get out of bed yourself. And you draw better. And get about your life better.\u2019\n\nEarlier this year Billy bleakly said he felt his life was \u2018slipping away\u2019 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this year Billy bleakly said he felt his life was \u2018slipping away\u2019 as he battled the incurable disease.\n\n\u2018My life, it\u2019s slipping away and I can feel it and I should. I\u2019m 75, I\u2019m near the end,\u2019 he said earlier on his documentary Made In Scotland.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a damn sight nearer the end than I am the beginning. But it doesn\u2019t frighten me, it\u2019s an adventure and it is quite interesting to see myself slipping away.\u2019\n\nBut speaking to the BBC ahead of the release of his new book Tall Tales and Wee Stories, he admitted he is \u2018not ready\u2019 to perform again, and that he doesn\u2019t know if he \u2018can do it with the state my mind is in\u2019.\n\n\u2018British comedy is in great shape now. I\u2019d be scared to go on with these [current] guys,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m old, I\u2019m 76 \u2013 my hearing, my eyesight, the way I walk, it\u2019s all beginning to fail.
