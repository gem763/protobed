The U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State referred all queries about the operation to the Pentagon, which did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIf confirmed, Baghdadi\u2019s death would bring a dramatic end to a years-long hunt for the man who spearheaded the Islamic State\u2019s transformation from an underground insurgent band to a powerful quasi-state that straddled two countries and spawned copycat movements across continents.\n\nAD\n\nA former university professor who was once held in a U.S.-run prison in Iraq, Baghdadi has been erroneously reported killed or wounded multiple times.\n\nOne official said that, during the operation, an individual believed to be the militant leader appeared to have detonated an explosive vest and killed himself. Officials said they were now seeking to verify whether that person was in fact Baghdadi.\n\nAD\n\nAmerica\u2019s allies in the region were quick to suggest they were involved in the operation, with the Iraqis in particular saying they provided key intelligence to finding the reclusive insurgent leader.\n\nA senior official from Iraq\u2019s intelligence service, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said the arrests and interrogation of a number of people close to Baghdadi yielded up his location, which they then gave to the Americans. He confirmed the location raided Saturday was the one his service had discovered.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces \u2014 long time U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State \u2014 indicated that they too had provided intelligence for the operation.\n\n\u201cSuccessful historical operation as a result of joint intelligence work with the United States of America,\u201d Gen. Mazloum Abdi tweeted, without elaborating.\n\nAD\n\nHis spokesman, Mustafa Bali, followed up in a tweet of his own explicitly stating its involvement.\n\n\u201cSuccessful and effective operation by our forces is yet another proof of SDF\u2019s anti-terror capability. We continue to work with our partners in the global @coalition in the fight against ISIS terrorism,\u201d he tweeted, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces.\n\nTrump has recently been accused of abandoning the Kurds following a decision to pull back most of the U.S. forces in northern Syria that had provided a deterrent against the Turks across the border.\n\nA senior Turkish official said that \u201cto the best of my knowledge\u201d Baghdadi had arrived at the location where the raid occurred 48 hours before the U.S. military operation. The official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said Turkey\u2019s military had been informed of the raid in advance but declined to say whether Ankara had shared intelligence that led to the operation, or whether Baghdadi was dead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIraq\u2019s state-run Iraqiyah TV channel broadcast footage of what it called the aftermath of the attack, showing a rocky area marked by a crater and a pile of clothes on the ground, as well as a distant nighttime blast it said was the attack itself.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, which at its largest stretched across much of Iraq and Syria, has been largely destroyed following years of assaults by U.S., Syrian, Iraqi, European and other forces. But officials believe that the organization remains a formidable threat determined to regain strength.\n\n\n\nWhile Baghdadi, a native of the Iraqi city of Samarra believed to be in his mid-40s, has remained a reclusive figure even to his followers, he urged militants in an audio message issued last month to conduct attacks against security forces and to attempt to break imprisoned brethren out of jail.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe raid comes as the United States scrambles to adjust its posture in Syria in the wake of Trump\u2019s decision to curtail the U.S. military mission. Trump said earlier this month he would pull out nearly all of the approximately 1,000 troops in Syria amid a Turkish offensive against Syrian Kurdish troops who have been the Pentagon\u2019s main battlefield partner there, but evolving plans now call for a larger residual force that could mean a substantial ongoing campaign.\n\nPentagon officials have warned that the Islamic State could use the further upheaval in Syria as an opportunity to stage a comeback. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper last week acknowledged that more than 100 fighters had escaped from Kurdish-run prisons.\n\nAccording to Javed Ali, a former White House senior director for counterterrorism, the death of Baghdadi would be a \u201chuge blow.\u201d But, like the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces in 2011, it \u201cwill not lead to strategic defeat,\u201d he said. Ali noted that ISIS has proved resilient despite the physical loss of its caliphate. \u201cThat's something we learned in the aftermath of the bin Laden raid,\u201d another high-risk mission.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe raid targeting Baghdadi took place outside of the area where the U.S. military, which began airstrikes on Islamic State positions in Syria in 2014 and established a ground mission the following year, has focused its campaign in recent years. But there have been occasional U.S. attacks on militant targets in Idlib, including an airstrike last month.\n\nWhile Idlib, the only province held by the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after eight years of war, is controlled by a patchwork of rebel groups, the dominant military power is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which is loosely tied to al-Qaeda.\n\nSyrian rebels ejected the Islamic State from Idlib in 2014, but in recent months fleeing Islamic State members have been showing up in the province. Some have been caught and executed by HTS, a fierce rival of the Islamic State.\n\nLiz Sly in Los Angeles, Souad Mekhennet in Germany, Sarah Dadouch in Beirut, Kareem Fahim in Istanbul, Mustafa Salim in Baghdad and Shane Harris and Ellen Nakashima in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "It was not clear whether militant leader was killed.
