Should we be as concerned on behalf of the beautiful young men and women in our own lives as the first mom and pop are about Baron?\n\nThis all seems to have been prompted by a series of reports highlighting that six Americans may have died from the habit, with hundreds potentially having contracted lung-related illnesses.\n\nColour me shocked. Purposefully pumping your lungs full of a bunch of chemicals human lungs didn't evolve to handle has a health impact. How\u2019d that happen?\n\nThe trouble with vaping is that it\u2019s a relatively new product that hasn\u2019t been around long enough for scientists to be able to say whether there are health risks associated with it and what those risks might be.\n\nWhat has been definitively proved is that getting a nicotine hit through smoking cigarettes is a thoroughly bad idea if you want to enjoy a long and healthy life.\n\nThe research, such as it is, suggests vaping is somewhat less harmful than normal cigarettes.\n\nA couple of years back, a Cancer Research UK-funded study of 181 smokers and ex-smokers found that those in the latter category who had used e-cigarettes or other nicotine replacements benefitted from lower levels of toxins than the former.\n\n\u201cThe findings of this study do appear to reassure that use of e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy \u2013 while continuing to provide nicotine \u2013 can reduce exposure to toxic chemicals that can lead to cancer in cigarette smokers,\u201d opined the NHS.\n\nBut it also highlighted the study\u2019s limitations.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US said of the allegedly vaping related deaths, \u201cWe do not yet know the specific cause of these illnesses. The investigation has not identified any specific E-cigarette or vaping product (devices, liquids, refill pods, and/or cartridges) or substance that is linked to all cases.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s investigating further. As it should.\n\nBut it hardly bears repeating that even if it is proved that vaping was the main cause of the six deaths, guns kill many times that number in the US every day.\n\nIn 2017 there were 11,000 firearm-related homicides in that country.\n\nThen there\u2019s obesity. A recent study suggested rising rates in the US had stalled or reversed decades of progress with respect to deaths from heart disease, strokes and related complications.\n\nWant more? Let\u2019s talk air pollution. Globally, 4.2m people succumb to that every year according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on climate change.\n\nYou see where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nAll of those issues warrant more attention from policy makers than does vaping. E-cigarettes could surely use more investigation. But a panic? A statement on the White House lawn? Please.\n\nOf course, creating a fuss about them could come in quite handy to divert attention from things such as from dismal poll ratings and other screw ups.\n\nKids! Just say no!\n\nJust saying.\n\nDealing with a potentially risky product like e-cigs isn\u2019t hard. Make sure users are exposed to clear warnings about the lack of data when it comes to what they are doing and the potential harm they may be incurring. Put in sensible legislative framework around their sale. Do more research, which could be funded by a small levy on the sale of vaping products.\n\nBut when you put the habit against the world\u2019s many problems and the very real threats they pose to America\u2019s, not to mention the world\u2019s youth, it\u2019s no more than a puff of smoke by comparison.", "description": "Wake up America!
