We must have consistency. We have to have more life in our game if we want to do important things this year.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Injuries \u2018part of football\u2019 \u2013\n\nThey sit bottom of the group, with just one point from their opening two games and the prospect of failing to make the knock-out stages for the first time in the Champions League still faint, but a possibility nonetheless.\n\nIt also suggests for all the good intentions about consistency in La Liga and wrestling back some of the domination enjoyed by Barcelona over the last decade, for Real Madrid the Champions League perhaps never plays second fiddle.\n\nAfter all, it was in the Champions League that Zidane forged his reputation as a coach, three triumphs in a row almost eradicating from memory his more disappointing period in the domestic league and cups.\n\nZidane might have weighed up that there is time and games to recuperate in La Liga that do not exist in Europe but losing to Mallorca does not come without a cost.\n\nAfter five games unbeaten, doubts have returned about his team and the spotlight is back on their Frenchman.\n\nPerhaps he hoped for more from those that came in. Isco, Luka Jovic and Vinicius Junior were all taken off in the second half on Saturday and while Vinicus is young and Jovic recently signed, it remains to be seen how long it might take to regain Zidane\u2019s trust.\n\nAlvaro Odriozola, in for Carvajal at right-back, was at fault for the goal and then sent off.\n\n\u201cInjuries are part of football,\u201d Zidane said.\n\n\u201cThere were other players and we had to do better.\u201d\n\nWhen Madrid won the league under Zidane in 2017, he successfully rotated in games against lesser sides but, despite around 300 million euros ($300 million) spent last summer, his squad might not have the same depth.\n\nGalatasaray have won only four of their opening eight Super Lig games and have not reached the Champions League last 16 since 2014.\n\nBut Madrid cannot be complacent, having lost three of their last four visits to the Turkish giants.\n\nZidane\u2019s hopes of progress will be transformed with a victory but he might need his best players back to do it.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 Zinedine Zidane said in April Real Madrid would prioritise La Liga over the Champions League this season and their defeat to Real", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/2cfaf7_zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-are-champions-league-group-two-matches-zidane-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
