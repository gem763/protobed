REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\n\nSearches took place in 39 towns and cities, four days after the ruling United Russia party, which supports President Vladimir Putin, lost a third of its seats in the Moscow city assembly while easily retaining its dominant nationwide position.\n\nNavalny had urged his supporters to vote tactically in last weekend\u2019s local and regional elections to try to reduce the chances of Kremlin-backed candidates, a strategy that appears to have had some success in the capital.\n\n\u201cPutin is very angry,\u201d Navalny wrote on social media after the raids. \u201cThis is a case where the actions of the police are no different from those of burglars.\u201d\n\nAuthorities told activists that the searches were related to a money-laundering investigation into Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization that has published embarrassing investigations into what it says is the wrongdoing of corrupt officials.\n\nState investigators last month opened a criminal investigation into the alleged laundering of 1 billion roubles ($15 million) by the foundation itself. It also froze a slew of bank accounts linked to the foundation, a move Navalny\u2019s allies said was a trumped-up attempt to cripple his political movement.\n\nKira Yarmysh, Navalny\u2019s spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the scale and nature of the latest raids was unprecedented.\n\nLeonid Volkov, another senior Navalny ally, published a list of towns and cities where activists had been targeted.\n\n\u201cThe overall number of searches is over 150 and no less than 1,000 Russian law enforcement employees are involved (in the raids),\u201d Volkov wrote on social media.\n\nHe linked the searches to Navalny\u2019s tactical voting strategy and said the homes of activists, their relatives and the regional headquarters of Navalny\u2019s movement were being targeted.\n\nActivists were being taken in for questioning, he added, saying technical hardware was being confiscated.\n\n\u201cThe state has two tasks - to frighten and steal,\u201d wrote Volkov. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the aim of this operation is to destroy our headquarters structure and to obstruct the work of our (regional) headquarters.\u201d\n\nGolos, a non-governmental organization that monitors Russian elections, said on Thursday that the homes of its activists were also being raided by the authorities.", "description": "Russian law enforcement authorities on Thursday carried out mass raids on the homes and offices of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's supporters, as part of an investigation into money-laundering.", "authors": ["Andrew Osborn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428994305&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0DF", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
