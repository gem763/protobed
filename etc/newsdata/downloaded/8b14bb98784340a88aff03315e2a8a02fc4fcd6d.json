In the following days, she couldn\u2019t stop sleeping, and decided to go for another consultation with a new doctor.\n\nWOMAN'S FACE BURNED AFTER 'ROMANTIC' CANDLE IGNITES PILLOW FIRE\n\n\u201cI have seen more than 10 doctors over the years who would just address my symptoms,\u201d Churan told the news outlet. \u201cI have been misdiagnosed with borderline diabetes, generalized anxiety disorder, depression and PCOS. I told this doctor that my face was changing, and I was getting uglier and that I didn\u2019t understand why I was gaining weight since I was barely eating.\u201d\n\nShe was given a blood test, with the results revealing a pituitary gland tumor was fueling her symptoms. Most pituitary tumors are benign, and they often affect the levels of hormones in the body, according to the Mayo Clinic. Not every tumor will cause symptoms, with the case depending on the type of hormone being affected. However, for patients diagnosed with a growth hormone-secreting tumor, symptoms may include coarsened facial features, enlarged hands and feet, excess sweating, high blood sugar, heart problems, joint pain, misaligned teeth and increased body hair.\n\nGIRL, 5, RECEIVES 36 STITCHES AFTER DOG 'RIPPED OFF' HER FACE\n\nThere are several approaches to treating a pituitary tumor including removal, or controlling its growth through medications, according to Mayo Clinic. For Churan, her next step was to search the Internet for cases similar to hers, but she was disappointed in what she found.\n\n\u201cThere really is no information other than extreme cases online,\u201d she said, according to MediaDrumWorld.com. \u201cThere\u2019s barely any awareness or tools to help people recognize the signs, so many cases are diagnosed as hormonal disorders. I saw the scariest photos of 'Andre the Giant' and others who had not been treated early on during the process. I was mortified, scared, and hopeless.\u201d\n\nShe sought the help of an endocrinologist in Alberta, who allegedly told her that the tumor needed to come out otherwise it would continue changing her appearance. She said the results were immediate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAfter having the tumor removed, my nose and chin have shrunk, while my feet are down a size and a half,\u201d she told MediaDrumWorld.com.\n\nChuran added that she easily shed weight and is now encouraging others to find their true diagnosis.\n\n\u201cBeing rare is a very difficult thing, especially when many doctors don\u2019t know how to treat you,\u201d she told the news outlet. \u201cYou must stay positive and find hope in any way you can while fighting. I want people to understand that a simple blood test can often diagnose a pituitary tumor.\u201d", "description": "She said she had been to over 10 doctors who failed to recognize the signs of a tumor.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/h_MDRUM_Chin_Taking_Over_My_Face-13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
