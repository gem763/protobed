Or, in this case, a penis a penis.\n\nI must be tired because I thought this was the throbbiest of penises. https://t.co/nX5jH5oVC9 \u2014 Stephanie (@StephanieYeboah) October 1, 2019\n\nFirst of all, the word \u201cthrobbiest\u201d needs to be banned immediately. And second of all, yes, this is the throbbiest of penises and you cannot convince me otherwise.\n\nThe post, which was originally posted by @robertaarocha, has amassed a whopping 33k likes and 10.8k retweets since October 2. The post has also gained a string of replies from people who also saw a penis in the photo.\n\nI thought it was a dildo inspired by HR Giger ???? \u2014 Monk de Wally de Honk (a Draclea) (@PaulWurgisnacht) October 1, 2019\n\nNope .I thought you'd just posted a giant penis too\u2026 my eyes were shooketh ???????????????? \u2014 Part of the Rebel Alliance and a Traitor (@HerRoyalDykness) October 1, 2019\n\nBut it turns out the photo is actually just a surprisingly intricate braid that likely took a long time to do. The poor stylist probably didn\u2019t realise she was turning the model\u2019s head into a big schlong at the time, but hindsight is a beautiful thing.\n\nUpon further inspection it\u2019s obvious that the photo is just a head of hair, and not the head of something else, but a fancy braid just isn\u2019t as share-worthy, is it? Stephanie sure didn\u2019t think so.\n\nThe lesson here? Don\u2019t learn to braid. If, like me, you\u2019re feeling like a total pleb for barely being able to pull off a basic plait, at least be glad you\u2019re not accidentally turning yourself into an actual dickhead.", "description": "Fashion blogger Stephanie Yeboah has gone viral for sharing a photo of a braid that looks like, you guessed it, a big dick.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-04-at-5.47.54-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
