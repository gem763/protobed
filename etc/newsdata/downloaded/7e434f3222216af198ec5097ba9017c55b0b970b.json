He said GM responded Sunday morning by reverting back to an offer that had been rejected and made few changes.\n\nThe company\u2019s proposal did nothing to address a host of items, Dittes wrote, specifying job security for members during the term of the four-year contract.\n\nNormally in contract talks, the union bargains for commitments from the company to build new vehicles, engines, transmissions and other items at U.S. factories represented by the union.\n\n\u201cIt did nothing to provide job security during the term of this agreement,\u201d Dittes wrote. \u201cWe, in this union, could not be more disappointed with General Motors who refuse to recognize the experience and talent of our membership.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, GM GM, -0.20% said it continues to negotiate in good faith \u201cwith very good proposals that benefit employees today and builds a stronger future for all of us.\u201d\n\nThe company said it is committed to talking around the clock to resolve the dispute.\n\nBut Dittes wrote that while both sides had made progress on important issues two days ago, the talks now \u201chave taken a turn for the worse.\u201d\n\nDittes also sent a sharp letter to GM\u2019s vice president for labor relations Sunday, saying: \u201cYou didn\u2019t even have a professional courtesy to explain why you could not accept or why you rejected our package proposal for each item we addressed.\u201d\n\nA person briefed on the talks said Sunday that the union voiced concerns about GM increasing production in Mexico, where it now builds pickup trucks, small cars and two SUVs. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private, said both sides are far apart on guarantees of new products in U.S. factories.\n\nGM leads all companies in automobiles produced in Mexico at just over 833,000 last year, according to LMC and the Center for Automotive Research, a think-tank based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Of GM vehicles sold in the U.S., 22% are produced in Mexico.\n\nGM\u2019s U.S. factories have been shut down since the workers walked out Sept. 16. Parts shortages also have forced the company to close plants in Mexico and Canada.\n\nIndustry analysts say GM is losing more than $80 million a day as the strike continues. Workers earn $250 per week in strike pay while they\u2019re on the picket lines, about one-fifth of what they normally make.\n\nWages and pensions are among the issues that remained unsettled.\n\nStriking workers have said they want a bigger share of the more than $30 billion in profits that GM has made during the past five years. But the company wants to cut its labor costs so they are closer to those at U.S. factories run by foreign automakers, mainly in the South.", "description": "Contract talks aimed at ending a 21-day strike by the United Auto Workers against General Motors have taken a turn for the worse, hitting a big snag over...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR890_gm_str_ZG_20190923135816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
