We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong,\" the testimony reads.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the committee chairman, said he plans to address families of the crash victims at Tuesday's hearing. \"I promise to their loved ones that we will find out what went wrong and work to prevent future tragedies\".\n\nOn Monday, Muilenburg visited the Indonesian embassy in Washington, DC, to meet with the ambassador and \"pay our respects to those lost on board Lion Air flight 610 on the first anniversary of the accident,\" Boeing said in a statement.\n\nMuilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing's chairman by the board this month, will also testify before the US House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.\n\nMichael Stumo, the father of Samya Rose Stumo, who died in the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in March, said the victims' families plan to hold up photos of \"the loved ones we lost\" to \"make sure the focus is on that, rather than political or bureaucratic or engineering issues.\"\n\nHe questioned why Boeing is only now adding safeguards to a flight control system known as MCAS that investigators have linked to both crashes.\n\n\"When you knew the MCAS system was part of the Lion Air crash, why didn't you act to correct it immediately instead of still withholding information about it and blaming the pilots?\" Stumo said of Boeing.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is not expected to approve the 737 MAX's ungrounding until December at the earliest. US airlines have cancelled flights into January and February because of the grounding.\n\nIn March, after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane was grounded worldwide.\n\nIndonesian investigators reported on Friday that Boeing, acting without adequate oversight from US regulators, failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX, sowing the seeds for the October 29, 2018, Lion Air crash, which also involved errors by the airline workers and crew whose training did not cover the situation that led to the crash.\n\nMuilenburg added that \"regulators should approve the return of the MAX to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane's safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.\"", "description": "Boeing is struggling to recover after two crashes, which killed 346 people, led to the grounding of all 737 MAX planes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/f4714a8f1da1496eb324fa44d8014e1a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
