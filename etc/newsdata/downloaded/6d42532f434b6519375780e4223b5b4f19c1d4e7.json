(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nImpeachment mania continued to dominate the national news this week. Democrats are telling anyone who will listen, \u201cTrump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine unless the country would agree to investigate the Bidens. He tried to get a foreign power to dig up dirt on his political opponent. Trump is unhinged. He\u2019s vulgar. He\u2019s doing tremendous damage to the country.\u201d Their rhetoric, however, has conspicuously ignored the great white elephant in the room.\n\nNone of them have mentioned the \u201cfavor\u201d Trump had requested early in his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After Trump had congratulated Zelensky for his party\u2019s victory in the parliamentary elections, Trump noted that member countries of the EU, especially Germany, were not doing enough to help Ukraine and suggested that Zelensky speak with them about it.\n\nThen Trump abruptly changed the subject. He asked Zelensky for a favor, the only \u201cfavor\u201d he asked for on the call. President Trump said:\n\nI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike...I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\n\nClearly, this was a priority for him. Once that topic had been discussed Trump turned to the Bidens. He said:\n\nGood because I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that\u2019s really unfair. A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what\u2019s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\n\nOne of the most intriguing parts of the Democrats\u2019 reaction to this call was that they ignored Trump\u2019s request for a favor to learn more about CrowdStrike, the American computer security company that performed a forensic examination on the DNC\u2019s server after they claimed they\u2019d been hacked. CrowdStrike determined that the server had been hacked by the Russians and issued a report stating their conclusions.\n\nOddly, the DNC had refused to allow the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security to conduct their own analysis of the server. The FBI was forced to accept the report from CrowdStrike.\n\nMichael Mukasey, who served as Attorney General for the last two years of the George W. Bush administration, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last week. He had noticed another strange thing. On the same day Trump released the transcript of his call with Zelensky, the DOJ issued a press release which said that Trump had never spoken with Attorney General William Barr \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son or asked him to contact Ukraine on this or any other matter.\u201d It also said Barr has had no contact with Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, the press release said:\n\nA Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. While the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.\n\nThe American Spectator\u2019s George Parry believes the \u201creference to CrowdStrike indicates that the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of the counterintelligence operation against candidate and president-elect Trump may be hot on the trail of exposing what could well be a seminal lie that the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer server was hacked by Russian operatives.\u201d\n\nParry, a former federal and state prosecutor, tells a fascinating story. He starts with the timeline.\n\nJune 12, 2016: WikiLeaks announced they had obtained stolen computer files about the Clinton campaign. June 14, 2016: Two days later, CrowdStrike, which was working for the DNC, announced that it had detected Russian malware on the DNC\u2019s computer server. The next day, a self-described Romanian hacker, Guccifer 2.0, claimed he was a WikiLeaks source and had hacked the DNC\u2019s server. He then posted online DNC computer files that contained metadata that indicated Russian involvement in the hack. July 22, 2016: WikiLeaks published approximately 20,000 DNC emails on the Friday before the start of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nYou may recall the emails showed that the DNC had their thumb on the scale for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAfter Clinton\u2019s defeat, her public relations director published an op-ed in the Washington Post. She wrote that during the convention, she had tried to \u201cget the press to focus on \u2026 the prospect that Russia had not only hacked and stolen emails from the DNC, but that it had done so to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary.\u201d\n\nThe DNC, as mentioned above, had refused access to their server to the FBI and the DHS. What were they hiding?\n\nIn July 2017, President Trump received a letter from the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), \u201can organization of former CIA, FBI, National Security Agency, and military intelligence officers, technical experts, and analysts.\u201d Parry explains:\n\nVIPS has a well-established record of debunking questionable intelligence assessments that have been slanted to serve political purposes. For example, in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, VIPS courageously and correctly challenged the accuracy and veracity of the CIA\u2019s intelligence estimates that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and that he posed a threat to the United States. Similarly, VIPS has condemned the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d on suspected terrorists. In short, VIPS can hardly be described as either a right-wing cabal or a group carrying water for the Republican Party. In its analysis of the purported DNC hack, VIPS brought to bear the impressive talents of more than a dozen experienced, well-credentialed experts, including William Binney, a former NSA technical director and cofounder of the NSA\u2019s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center; Edward Loomis, former NSA technical director for the Office of Signals Processing; and Skip Folden, a former IBM information technology manager. As the French would say, these are l\u2019hommes s\u00e9rieux, as are the other computer-system designers, program architects, and analysts with whom they investigated the Clinton-DNC hack story.\n\nVIPS concluded:\n\nFirst, VIPS concluded that the DNC data were not hacked by the Russians or anyone else accessing the server over the internet. Instead, the data were downloaded by means of a thumb drive or similar portable storage device physically attached to the DNC server. How was this determined? The time stamps contained in the released computer files\u2019 metadata establish that, at 6:45 p.m. July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes (not megabits) of data were downloaded from the DNC\u2019s server. This took 87 seconds, which means the transfer rate was 22.7 megabytes per second, a speed, according to VIPS, that \u201cis much faster than what is physically possible with a hack.\u201d Such a speed could be accomplished only by direct connection of a portable storage device to the server. Accordingly, VIPS concluded that the DNC data theft was an inside job by someone with physical access to the server. VIPS also found that, if there had been a hack, the NSA would have a record of it that could quickly be retrieved and produced. But no such evidence has been forthcoming. Can this be because no hack occurred? Even more remarkable, the experts determined that the files released by Guccifer 2.0 have been \u201crun, via ordinary cut and paste, through a template that effectively immersed them in what could plausibly be cast as Russian fingerprints.\u201d In other words, the files were deliberately altered to give the false impression that they were hacked by Russian agents. Thanks to the VIPS experts, the Russia-hacking claim \u2014 the very prologue of the Trump-Russia conspiracy story \u2014 appeared to have been affirmatively and convincingly undercut. After the DNC denied law enforcement access to its server, the FBI \u2014 under James Comey\u2019s leadership \u2014 meekly agreed to accept the findings of CrowdStrike, the DNC\u2019s private cybersecurity firm, as to the server\u2019s contents. This was in lieu of the FBI\u2019s using legal process (such as a search warrant or forthwith grand jury subpoena) to seize and search the server for Russian malware and evidence of hacking, even though, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Comey conceded that \u201cbest practices\u201d require \u201cdirect access\u201d to the allegedly hacked computers.\n\nIn his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017, Comey explained, \u201cIn the case of the DNC \u2026 we did not have access to the devices themselves. We got relevant forensic information from a private party, a high-class entity [CrowdStrike], that had done the work.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Burr questioned this. \u201cBut no content? Isn\u2019t content an important part of forensics from a counterintelligence standpoint?\u201d\n\nComey answered, \u201cIt is, although what was briefed to me by my folks \u2026 is that they had gotten the information from the private party [CrowdStrike] that they needed to understand the intrusion by the spring of 2016.\u201d\n\nThe failure of the FBI and the DHS to inspect the DNC\u2019s server looms large in the origination of the Russian collusion story as Parry explained above and it sure looks like Durham\u2019s team thinks so too. It was a pivotal event. So, why really didn\u2019t they insist on examining the server?\n\nFast forward to March 13, 2019. VIPS submitted a memorandum to William Barr.\n\nThey accurately predicted that Mueller would choose to \u201cfinesse\u201d the key issue of whether or not the Russians hacked the DNC computers by relying on the purported analysis by \u201cCrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm of checkered reputation and multiple conflicts of interest, including very close ties to a number of key anti-Russian organizations.\u201d VIPS stated that \u201cdirect access to the actual computers is the first requirement\u201d in any valid forensic analysis. The memorandum then set forth VIPS\u2019 additional analysis of the WikiLeaks DNC files which revealed \u201ca FAT (File Allocation Table) system property. This shows that the data had been transferred to an external storage device, such as a thumb drive, before WikiLeaks posted them\u201d (Emphasis in original). After explaining in detail the significance of the FAT system property, the memorandum then re-addressed the elephant in the room that the media and investigators were ignoring: \u201cthe apparent failure of NSA\u2019s dragnet, collect-it-all approach \u2014 including \u2018cast-iron\u2019 coverage of WikiLeaks \u2014 to provide forensic evidence (as opposed to \u2018assessments\u2019) as to how the DNC emails got to WikiLeaks and who sent them.\u201d Further to this point, VIPS posed this critical question: Is it possible that NSA has not yet been asked to produce the collected packets of DNC email data claimed to have been hacked by Russia? Surely, this should be done before Mueller completes his investigation. NSA has taps on all the transoceanic cables leaving the U.S., and would most certainly have such packets if they exist.\n\nParry notes that \u201cVIPS proved to be prescient. As with the seemingly feckless Comey, Mueller reported neither a direct access forensic examination of the DNC computers nor a query directed to the NSA for its intercepts of the purportedly hacked files.\u201d\n\nIn summary, by denying law enforcement access to its allegedly hacked computers, the DNC conducted itself like a criminal suspect with something to hide. And, in the face of this suspicious behavior, the failure by Comey\u2019s FBI and Team Mueller to conduct a direct access forensic examination of the DNC\u2019s computers or to seek corroboration from the NSA of any hacking strongly suggests that they had no interest in getting to the truth about the Russian hacking story.\n\nIt appears that the words \u201cfavor, CrowdStrike and server\u201d struck fear in the hearts of Democrats, who had hoped the Mueller report had put that subject to bed. And coming in the conversation as it did, even before any mention of the Bidens, told them it was indeed on the minds of Durham\u2019s team and that they were actively investigating it. For the Democrats, Biden is expendable. Who knows, eliminating Biden from the race may have even been part of their plan given that he is considered moderate compared to the rest of the field. But the DNC\u2019s claim that their server was hacked by the Russians to sway the election to Donald Trump is the root from which their entire narrative sprung. Sean Hannity would say that Durham\u2019s team is \u201cright on top of the target.\u201d Democrats are terrified and they\u2019re striking out in the only way they know how.", "description": "Why is No one Talking About the Most Crucial Part of Trump\u2019s Call With Zelensky?", "authors": ["Elizabeth Vaughn", "Nick Arama", "Sister Toldjah", "Alex Parker", "Jennifer Van Laar", "Posted At Am On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/AP_16207496019404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
