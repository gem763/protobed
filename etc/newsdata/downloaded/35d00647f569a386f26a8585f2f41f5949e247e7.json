Then, yes, 100 per cent,' said Silva.\n\n'It doesn't make sense for me or the football club or the project to change because we didn't win the last three games. It cannot. That is impossible.\n\n'Never am I the coach that tries to find excuses. In some moments it is easy for a manager to find them, but I am not this type of person. But we inside the club know what happened last summer. We are football people. I know what the club asked me as well.\n\n'I know everything that has happened and it is so clear. Stability is so important. I don't feel anything has changed in the last week.\n\nAlex Iwobi (above), Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Moise Keane have yet to start a game together\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\n'Of course, I am not happy; the players - everyone inside is not happy, we should go to the match again to win and try to get the points. Nothing more than that.'\n\nA measure of the transition is that three of Everton's biggest signings in the summer - Alex Iwobi, Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Moise Keane - have yet to start a game together and Silva knows it is going to take time before they are settled.\n\n'In football, the manager will always be the person who is in front,' said Silva, defending his credentials.\n\n'That is something natural. I don't like to find excuses because it is not my way. Who understands football really, look to the situation and understand what has happened.\n\n'I believe in all of them and let's support them to challenge the season with the same confidence that I see the players have when they are working hard.\n\n'We showed last summer we had a project and I'm the manager to handle and work with the players. Now we want to win football games.'", "description": "The Portuguese knows his position is under scrutiny following Everton's lacklustre start to the Premier League campaign and the spotlight will intensify should Silva be on the end of a bad result.", "authors": ["Dominic King For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/19/19310826-0-image-a-19_1570214608663.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
