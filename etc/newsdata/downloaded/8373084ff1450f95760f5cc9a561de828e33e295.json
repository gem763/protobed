She read the declaration on behalf of the group.\n\n\u201cWe therefore support those who are rising up peacefully against governments around the world that are failing to act proportionately to the scale of the crisis,\u201d she said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A further 1,463 volunteers have been arrested in the past week in another 20 cities, including Brussels, Amsterdam, New York, Sydney and Toronto, according to the group\u2019s tally. More protests in this latest wave are due in the coming days.\n\nWhile many scientists have shunned overt political debate, fearing that being perceived as activists might undermine their claims to objectivity, the 395 academics who had signed the declaration by 11am on Sunday chose to defy convention.\n\n\u201cThe urgency of the crisis is now so great that many scientists feel, as humans, that we now have a moral duty to take radical action,\u201d Ms Grossman told Reuters.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But its success in paralysing parts of London has also angered critics who complained the movement has inconvenienced thousands of people and diverted police resources.\n\nExtinction Rebellion is aligned with a school strike movement inspired by Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, which mobilised millions of young people on 20 September. It hopes the scientists\u2019 support for the urgency of its message and its embrace of civil disobedience will bolster its legitimacy and draw more volunteers.\n\nThe group said more than half the signatories of the declaration are experts in the fields of climate science and the loss of wildlife. Although British universities and institutes were well represented, signatories also worked in countries including the United States, Australia, Spain and France.\n\nReuters", "description": "Almost 400 scientists have endorsed a civil disobedience campaign aimed at forcing governments to take rapid action to tackle climate change, warning that failure could inflict \u201cincalculable human suffering\u201d.", "authors": ["Matthew Green"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/16/extinction-rebellion-london.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
