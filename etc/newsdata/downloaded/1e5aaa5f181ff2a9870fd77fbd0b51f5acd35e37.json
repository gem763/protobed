Recession fears are rippling throughout the Continent.\n\nAccording to figures from fund analyst Morningstar, investors pulled \u00a31.3 billion out of UK equity funds in July as uncertainty gripped the region\n\nWhile this might be a concern for some fund managers, Tim Crockford, who runs the fund Hermes European ex UK, hopes his strategy of rooting out quality companies with long-term growth potential across mainland Europe will help steer the fund through the worst.\n\nCrockford says: \u2018It is a horrible time to be allocating assets [deciding which type of asset to invest in] and I am very grateful to be a stock picker. There are always exciting stocks to invest in. We are focused on the longer term horizon.\u2019\n\nCrockford looks for companies where a structural change within the organisation, or its market, or a key product looks likely to spur future growth.\n\nThe result is an eclectic mix of companies in the \u00a3275 million fund, ranging from a microchip manufacturer and sports goods maker to pharmaceuticals outsourcing service.\n\nEconomic troubles are not just a problem for Britain - recession fears are rippling throughout the Continent\n\nA strong contributor recently has been Adidas. Purchased in 2009, the sportswear giant\u2019s shares performed well at first. But by 2014 its share price was having \u2018a torrid time, dropping in half from peak to trough\u2019, Crockford says.\n\nHe saw it had made some mistakes over fashion trends \u2013 choosing dull colours over the more popular fluorescent variety favoured by rival makers such as Nike. It also suffered from sales falling in key emerging markets such as Russia.\n\nThis made Crockford nervous about holding on. But a day with the Adidas management at its Germany HQ, including questioning the head of research and development, reassured him they should stick with their investment.\n\nHe says: \u2018In fact, we were so impressed we doubled down after the visit.\n\nThe shares looked like a bargain.\u2019 He has been proven right as they have soared ahead in recent years, growing nearly fourfold since May 2015 to \u20ac273.50 (\u00a3244.20).\n\nAnother success has been Swiss firm Lonza Group. It is a contract manufacturing and development company that helps biotech companies to develop their more sophisticated, complex medicines at a lower cost. And as an outsourcer used by a large number of players in the industry it is well diversified and protected against the inevitable failure of certain drugs getting to market.\n\nA sector that has excited Crockford for some time is technology, with Netherlands-based microchip maker ASM International featuring large in the portfolio.\n\nIt provides the technology that enables the shrinking of electrical circuits \u2013 which helps the Intels and Samsungs of the world develop their faster and more efficient equipment. \u2018We\u2019ve held the shares since 2014 and they\u2019ve done well, in a zig zaggy way.\u2019\n\nDarius McDermott, managing director of fund analysis firm Fund Calibre, is impressed by Crockford, whose fund has outperformed peers over three and five years.\n\nMcDermott says: \u2018He tends to invest in quality companies \u2013 an investment style that has been in favour recently \u2013 but nevertheless he has added value consistently every year.\u2019 Ongoing charges are a respectable 0.89 per cent.", "description": "A fund that invests in European companies - but excludes those listed in the UK - has some resonance in the current political climate, especially as the 'B word' has frightened off serious numbers of investors from touching the British stock market in recent months.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
