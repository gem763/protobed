(Jessica Pons/for The Washington Post)\n\nBright midday sun pours through an open door on a recent Sunday, flooding a studio where a dance class has gone bananas.\n\n\n\nWhat started with gentle yoga stretches has exploded into a party, with 50 or more fired-up souls bopping and spinning in a freestyle conga line to the thumping bass of electro house music. Ryan Heffington, who\u2019s teaching the class, is the single bounciest person in the room. He leads this serpentine joy-jam like the Pied Piper of Self-Expression.\n\nHeffington moves like a trailblazer because he is one. His creative visions have rebooted the way the pop-culture world thinks about dance, and the way the dance world thinks about success, because his achievements \u2014 in music videos, film and television, onstage and in the business realm \u2014 have been as untraditional as his choreography.\n\n\n\nHe stops to pull up the neck of his T-shirt and mop his face with it. He demonstrates a move to his students that you\u2019ll never see in any conventional dance class: a wide squat, feet pumping, arms outstretched. His fingers wiggle impatiently, like he\u2019s hailing a waiter to bring over the dessert cart. He throws back his clean-shaven head and sticks out his tongue, tasting the humid Southern California air. His moves may look, at first, like random outbursts, but they tell a story. This one is about feeling worthy of what you desire.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou can ask for anything you want, remember that!\u201d Heffington, 46, shouts above the din. \u201cDon\u2019t make me choreograph a smile on your face.\u201d\n\nLara Spencer apologizes for ridiculing Prince George and ballet, but the damage has been done.\n\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t know Heffington\u2019s name, you\u2019re bound to know his work. His choreography is all over YouTube, for Arcade Fire, Sigur R\u00f3s and others. He created the time-shifting dance moves in the sci-fi series \u201cThe OA\u201d and in \u201cTransparent\u201d; he\u2019s uncorked kooky perfume ads for Kenzo and Chanel, and helped Uniqlo and Target market hipness. He\u2019s turned character actions into musical expression in the movies \u201cBaby Driver\u201d and Sia\u2019s forthcoming \u201cMusic.\u201d\n\nHeffington\u2019s choreography for Sia\u2019s \u201cChandelier\u201d music video, performed by the bounding, wild-eyed 11-year-old dance sensation Maddie Ziegler in 2014, rocketed it into the YouTube stratosphere. It\u2019s been viewed 2.1 billion times.\n\n\n\nStarting Friday , Heffington\u2019s work takes the spotlight in \u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d 100-minute series finale on Amazon Prime. Conceived as part comedy-drama, part surreal movie-musical, the episode distills the Pfefferman family\u2019s five-year saga of sexual awakening into singing and dancing. But more than Heffington\u2019s choreography is on view. As in \u201cChandelier\u201d and his classes, Heffington\u2019s philosophy of self-acceptance shines through.\n\n\n\nSeries star Judith Light puts it this way in a recent interview: Heffington \u201cjust sort of loved me into being able to do my very best. He\u2019s this very generous spirit. There\u2019s cheering but no shaming.\u201d\n\nHow sign-language interpreters convey the emotion of 'Dear Evan Hansen.'\n\n\n\nHeffington is on a mission, and his \u201cSweaty Sunday\u201d classes \u2014 open to all comers, all abilities \u2014 are as much a part of that mission as his work with Hollywood stars and Parisian models. Heffington is a dance populist. He wants dance to be our scrambled eggs, not some fussy, unapproachable delicacy.\n\n\n\n\u201cDance has such a strict definition to so many people. I\u2019m trying to break that,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone can dance.\u201d\n\nTo help people believe that, \u201cyou have to really hold them, and make sure they feel safe,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s 80 percent of the job. And then you can infuse ideas about movement and concept, and then it becomes fun.\n\n\u201cI think that's how we win.\u201d\n\nAmid upheavals, there's good news in Hong Kong: Its ballet thrives.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeffington has promised himself to never stop teaching, no matter how busy he gets. (Jessica Pons/for The Washington Post)\n\nIn two days he\u2019ll be shooting another Chanel commercial in Paris. He\u2019s also shopping for a new home for his dance studio, aptly called the Sweat Spot. The humble single-story bunker it\u2019s occupied for nearly a decade in funky Silver Lake \u2014 a neighborhood Heffington helped gentrify \u2014 is about to be demolished for apartments. So Heffington really shouldn\u2019t be here, spending the afternoon jumping around with his students. He\u2019s too busy for this much fun, for gyrating until he\u2019s wringing wet on a rare day off from rehearsals and sound stages and contracts.\n\n\n\n\u201cFind your funky self!\u201d he calls out. Crouching into another squatty, arm-waving stance: \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re keeping the bad juju away. We all have that power!\u201d\n\n\n\nHeffington has promised himself never to stop teaching, no matter how busy he gets. Who knows when a student will surprise him with some crazy new move that the choreographer can slip into his next video?\n\n\u201cI get so inspired by these non-dancers,\u201d he says after his last class of the day, late in the afternoon, when he cools down over lunch down the block. Slim and wiry, with a bushy black mustache and round, earnest eyes, Heffington has changed into a green print shirt, rolled-up khakis and sandals. You\u2019d never guess he just spent three hours in a mob of bodies pounding the dance floor so hard it pulsed like a living organism.\n\nOn 'Pose,' dancing isn't just about self-expression. It's a survival skill for trans women.\n\n\n\nHis students \u201cmake choices I never would.\u201d Heffington grins, jabbing the table with a long finger: \u201cAnd I literally steal that s--- from them.\u201d\n\nHe has always been hungry for new ways of moving. He grew up in Yuba City, in Northern California, where starting at age 6 he studied jazz, tap and ballet. He arrived in L.A. at 18 for community college but ended up pursuing his education in the city\u2019s underground dance clubs.\n\n\u201cI'd go into a trance for five hours,\u201d he says. \u201cThat really developed how I moved as a human, not as a dancer. Everyone moves so differently, and to see that in the clubs was beautiful.\u201d\n\nFriends started asking if he\u2019d teach them how to move like he did, so free and uninhibited, which led him to open the Sweat Spot in 2010. He also started staging showcases, and a drag show/fashion show/dance party he collaborated on called \u201cKtchn\u201d drew notice from the local art scene. That\u2019s where Sia saw him. After that, the music-video work started rolling in.\n\nThe 31 best dance scenes in movies.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe completely broke every rule for dance in the best way possible, and that\u2019s why I like working with him so much,\u201d says Ziegler, who turns 17 on Sept. 30. For the past six years, ever since \u201cChandelier,\u201d she has been Sia\u2019s muse and alter ego through Heffington\u2019s choreography. The balance of balletic control and wild-eyed, flying-apart chaos that Heffington coaxed out of Ziegler in \u201cChandelier\u201d was an artistic milestone in the world of commercial dance. Its visceral portrayal of inner feelings builds and builds; it\u2019s deeply mysterious as much as urgent, and the turmoil is all the more powerful because we're watching a child express it with the abandon of a seasoned artist. Heffington\u2019s concept took a sharp left turn from the glitzier direction of most popular music videos: He bridged pop music with the symbolic, theatrical and expressive language of modern dance.\n\n\n\nHeffington oversees students in child\u2019s pose. (Jessica Pons/for The Washington Post)\n\nHe also upended the way Ziegler approached her craft.\n\n\n\n\u201cGrowing up I was always trained to be super technical and everything had to look perfect and put together,\u201d Ziegler says. \u201cWith him, there\u2019s so much more freedom, and I\u2019ve learned that the imperfections are amazing. . . . He broke so many standards I thought I had to live up to in the dance world, and taught me that flaws are beautiful.\u201d\n\nFor the \u201cTransparent\u201d finale, Heffington worked out the choreography with a group of professional dancers before teaching it to the actors. At that point, Light watched some of the work intended for her \u2014 a fantasy floor show dubbed \u201cYour Boundary Is My Trigger,\u201d where her character sports ladylike heels and a nursing bra, with a chorus of yentas in granny pants and bunny slippers. Light was awed by the freedom and collaboration Heffington encouraged, and to her surprise, she suddenly found herself whirling around the dance floor with the pros.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a dancer,\u201d Light says, \u201cand yet I was seeing how he opened up with all his dancers. So I just jumped in and we had this wonderful time together.\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan makes it so anyone can jump in,\u201d says Jason Baum, a producer and director who worked with Heffington on \u201cTransparent,\u201d the \u201cMusic\u201d movie and other projects. On the set of the \u201cTransparent\u201d finale, he says, Heffington held warm-ups every day, coaching the cast through 20 minutes of bouncing and shaking in the same motivational way he does for Sweaty Sundays.\n\n\u201cBy the last day of our shoot, we had the entire 100-person crew on the sound stage moving while Ryan talked them through it,\u201d Baum says. \u201cCamera operators, grips, wardrobe, makeup, hair \u2014 everyone was up there dancing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Heffington has changed the commercial field artistically, carving out space for thoughtful, quirky storytelling in movement. You see his influence in, for example, Justin Bieber\u2019s 2015 video, \u201cLove Yourself,\u201d a narrative with an out-of-sync romantic couple. They\u2019re even framed in the narrow hallways and doorways of a small apartment, as Ziegler is in \u201cChandelier,\u201d and the focus is largely on complicated emotions expressed in sharp, unusual gestures. \u201cNever Catch Me\u201d by Flying Lotus, which came out several months after \u201cChandelier,\u201d spins forward the poignancy and technical finesse of children dancing, placing them in another unexpected setting: a funeral.\n\nBut Heffington is not done spreading the gospel of dance love. There\u2019s more work to be done to make the industry more dance-friendly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tons of room to grow, for dancers and choreographers to get more credit,\u201d Heffington says. He adds that union coverage and health insurance would be a good start, as would pay equity. At one point earlier in his career as a video choreographer, hairdressers on a shoot were making twice his salary.\n\n\n\nNow that he\u2019s got the \u201cTransparent\u201d mini-musical under his belt, Heffington has Broadway aspirations. He\u2019d also like to produce more evenings of live performance, bringing commercial dancers and concert dancers together.\n\n\u201cMy voice is yearning to be louder,\u201d says Heffington, who\u2019s soft-spoken when he\u2019s not belting out pep talks over a driving bass line. \u201cI\u2019m really craving to bust through on a personal level.\u201d\n\nRead more by Sarah L.
