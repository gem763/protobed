Transitioning from student life to the workplace is not as easy as some people make it seem. The stress does end up getting to you in the end.\n\nThat said, there's always a little space for some workplace humour. So it comes as no surprise that some of us have ended up pulling off some truly bizarre and crazy shit while at work, all in the name of a little fun at work.\n\nWe asked eight people about the crazy stuff they've done at work, and their answers are quite something:\n\n1. \"I once started singing in the washroom so loud that people gathered outside the door just to have a good laugh. But guess what? They also loved my voice. Today, they call me the 'Nightingale of the floor.'\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n2. \"I remember working for 24 hours straight in the office without a break. I'll never recommend working for broadcast news to anyone.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n3. \"I brought hash brownies in office which most of my colleagues ate. No one had an idea about the special ingredient in it. It was the funniest day of my life.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n4. \"I danced like crazy in my bay during Diwali celebrations on Dhol beats, and even though some found it funny, I had a lot of fun. It was one crazy experience.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n5. \"I had to shave my beard in office once because I had to leave for a party right after work, one where I was expecting my crush to show up.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n6. \"I cribbed about the management on my second day to the person who was heading the entire team I was a part of. I never spoke to him again or even dared to look him in the eyes after that.\"\n\nUnsplash\n\n7. \"I hit a colleague in the face after a major sexist remark came out of his mouth. While people in my bay appreciated it, I was called by the HR immediately. \"\n\nUnsplash\n\n8. \"During lunch time, I went to a nearby bar and had two beers, which are enough to get me high. I returned but no one got to know I was drunk. \"\n\nUnsplash", "description": "Yes, we are all surrounded by work, work stress, workplaces, work stories, workload and everything that has 'work' as a first word. Leaving our awesome student life and entering into a workplace is tedious task and once you are in it, it becomes all the more stressful. No matter how particular we have to at workplaces and behave a certain way some of us know how to have fun even at workplaces rig", "authors": ["Arushi Lohia"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/work_1570442628_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
