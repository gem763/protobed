Researchers were able to extract cells from mice within two hours of injection in the study, led by University of California Santa Cruz research specialist Stephanie Smith-Berdan.\n\n\u201cThe rationale was to test whether known and approved vascular drugs could be repurposed to coax\" cells into the bloodstream, and \"this turned out to be right,\u201d said Camilla Forsberg, professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a senior researcher involved with the study.\n\nWhile Smith-Berdan and Forsberg work in pre-clinical research science and cannot test the new cocktail in humans, the prospect of quicker and less painful stem cell extraction will likely lead to an increase in volunteers if the clinical trials prove successful, according to Medical Daily.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nSmith-Berdan also told Medical Daily that since Aildenafil and Plerixafor are already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it will likely be easier for researchers to use them for further tests and studies.", "description": "The little blue pill used to treat erectile dysfunction was developed for heart disease.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/Viagra.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
