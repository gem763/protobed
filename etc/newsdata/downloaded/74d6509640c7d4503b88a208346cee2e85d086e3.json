Prepared for the worst but this doesn\u2019t scream descending triangle top into 50% selloffs to me. Also, VPVR gap at 6k was below \u2013 this time it is above. Just worth bearing in mind. Want to see Bulls re-claim $10.5k this week,\u201d he said while pointing to the below chart.\n\nWeekly $btc Chart removes alot of the noise.
