I talked to the IVF nurse and she said it was probably just a side-effect of the treatment.\n\n'But a week later, there was an indentation in the breast and the nipple had gone in. I called the nurse again and she told me not to worry.\n\nMrs Newman (pictured) discovered she had cancer about a year ago, after noticing a lump in her right breast\n\nAt the time, she was undergoing IVF in a desperate bid to have a baby with husband Alex\n\nMrs Middleton-Hughes was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 after finding a lump in her left breast while on a dream holiday to Australia\n\n'But I decided to go with my gut instinct and went to the doctor, who fast-tracked me for extensive tests.'\n\nMrs Newman added: 'Before the word \"cancer\" was even mentioned, I could see it in the doctor's face.\n\n'My first question was \"What's going to happen to my eggs?\" At that point, the most important thing to me was having a child. They told me not to panic.'\n\nDuring tests, Mrs Newman also mentioned that she had been suffering back pains, so she was also referred for specialist imaging. A week later, she was called back.\n\nShe said: 'The surgeon said to me \"I'm really sorry, there's nothing I can do.\" It was terrifying.\n\n'What she was trying to say was that there was nothing she could do as a surgeon - I had stage 4 breast cancer which had spread. But it sent me into a blind panic.'\n\nMrs Newman added: 'I didn't know if I was going to live or die. The whole thing was an absolute blur.'\n\nMrs Newman needed strong medication to control the pain and temporarily lost her ability to walk.\n\nHowever, she was put on the drug palbociclib (Ibrance), which had only just been approved on the NHS, and her disease is currently stable.\n\nShe said: 'My oncologist told me that was a game-changer. If it hadn't been approved, my prognosis would have been very different.'\n\nMrs Newman took three months off from her job at a finance brokerage.\n\nAn x-ray image showing hairdresser Nicky Newman's body riddled with 'secondary' tumours\n\nShe added: 'When I left hospital, I was grieving more for the fact that I had lost my chance to be a mother, than because I had cancer.\n\n'It was only six months down the line that I could finally say \"Oh my God, I have incurable cancer.\"\n\n'Then I had to grieve again for the life I thought I would have, or should have had.'\n\nMrs Newman added: 'There are tough times, of course, and we don't shy away from that. But our focus is on living your life and living it well.'\n\nMrs Middleton-Hughes was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014 after finding a lump in her left breast while on a dream holiday to Australia.\n\nShe underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy and recovered, but began to feel pain in her right shoulder in April 2016.\n\nWHAT IS SECONDARY BREAST CANCER? Secondary breast cancer, also known as metastatic breast cancer, is when tumour cells which started in the breast move to other parts of the body. The secondary cancer can take years to return, and does not always reappear in the breast. Some 35,000 people are thought to be living with the disease \u2013 some 35 per cent of women who get breast cancer will be diagnosed with secondary cancer within 10 years. Places commonly affected by spreading cancer include the bones, brain, liver, lungs and skin. While primary breast cancer can usually be operated on or cured with drugs or radiation, secondary cancer is incurable. Because secondary cancer has already started spreading around the body you can never be completely cured of it. But chemotherapy, hormone drugs and other treatments can slow down the growth and spread of tumours and improve patients' lives. Life expectancy varies depending on how advanced the cancer is, but many women live for years with the condition under control.

Her disease is currently stable, though incurable.\n\nShe said: 'I'm very, very grateful that the treatment I'm having is managing to give me a fairly normal life.\n\nMrs Middleton-Hughes has had to give up the hairdressing job she loved but in April this year she married husband Brad.\n\nAs part of the Stand Up To Cancer campaign, both women have painted their bodies with words which characterise their battle with cancer, including 'pain', 'infertility', 'fatigue' and 'stage 4'.\n\nThe campaign aims to unite scientists, celebrities and communities across the UK to raise cash for rapid new treatments.\n\nIt is supported by a host of celebrities including presenters Davina McCall and Maya Jama, comedians Alan Carr and Joe Lycett, and Olympic champion Greg Rutherford.\n\nLynn Daly, spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK, said: 'Faced with such a difficult prognosis, Nicky and Laura are being unbelievably brave and positive in sharing their very personal stories.\n\n'There's been amazing progress in the past few decades and more people are now surviving cancer than ever before.\n\n'But with one in two in the UK set to develop the disease at some point in our lives, and thousands and thousands of people in the same position as Nicky and Laura, there's still so much more to do.\n\n'Supporting Stand Up To Cancer enables scientists to explore brave new ways to fight the disease and develop radical treatments, meaning more lives are saved.'\n\nTo find out more about Stand Up To Cancer go to Standuptocancer.org.uk or channel4.co.uk/SU2C or follow the campaign on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.", "description": "Nicky Newman, from Guildford, Surrey and Laura Middleton-Hughes, from Norwich, have vowed to live life to the full together after finding friendship with each other.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404290-0-image-a-40_1570464490126.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
