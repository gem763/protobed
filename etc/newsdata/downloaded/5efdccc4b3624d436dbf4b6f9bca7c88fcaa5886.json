Add Interest\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with \u2014 with Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters on the South Lawn at the White House last Thursday before diving into a defense of his phone conversation with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cPresident Zelenskiy \u2014 if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens. Because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u201d\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe White House has not responded to an ABC News inquiry seeking clarification about whether the president's comments were in jest.\n\nBut after a second whistleblower came forward to support an intelligence official\u2019s initial complaint that the president illegally sought a political in-kind contribution from Ukraine, the president\u2019s closest allies were flatly dismissing the president\u2019s proposal for the Chinese as nothing more than a clumsy joke intended to rile up the press.\n\n\"You really think he was serious about thinking that China is going to investigate the Biden family?\" Jordan told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos, adding that Trump is \u201cgetting the press all spun up\u201d with the prospect. \u201cRemember, this is the president who's been tougher on China than any other president.\"\n\nThat GOP take gained traction late last week when Sen. Marco Rubio reached back into the GOP playbook to dismiss Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate Biden as an effort to provoke reporters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a real request or him just needling the press,\u201d Rubio, R-Fla., said. Trump even tweeted video of Rubio\u2019s answer, perhaps suggesting that he wasn\u2019t serious about asking a second country to investigate a political opponent.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to investigate the Biden family\u2019s financial ties to China is not new. During an interview with Fox News\u2019 Steve Hilton on May 19, Trump was asked whether the Biden\u2019s family business in China should be investigated.\n\n\u201c100 percent,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cIt's a disgrace.\"\n\nMark Zaid, an attorney who represents both whistleblowers, said his second client has already spoken to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general.\n\nWhile the date of that conversation remains unknown and it\u2019s unclear whether the second whistleblower has even filed a complimentary complaint, how the inspector general handles that interview could help determine the next steps for Congress.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats both hope to have an opportunity to question the whistleblowers in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I'm going to insist upon, that the whistleblower, one or two, whatever, they come forward, under oath, testify so the public can judge their credibility,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., a staunch Trump ally, said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen in the House I will make sure it happens in the Senate.\u201d\n\nDemocrat lawyer is same for both Whistleblowers?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will answer questions about his involvement in the affair at closed-door depositions before the House Intelligence and Oversight committees.\n\nThe first whistleblower, known as a U.S. intelligence official, alleged that Sondland was part of an effort to \"contain the damage\" done by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, through his efforts to push the Ukrainians toward a Biden investigation.\n\nHouse Democrats subpoenaed the Defense Department and White House Office of Management and Budget on Monday for information about the withholding of military aid to Ukraine. In a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Acting OMB director Russ Vought, Reps. Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel set a deadline for the requested records by Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry, we are hereby transmitting a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the accompanying schedule by October 15, 2019,\u201d the trio of chairmen wrote. \u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the Committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nThat subpoena is at least the eighth issued by Democrats in the wake of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThis Friday, Marie \u201cMasha\u201d Yovanovich, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine is expected to appear before those three committees at once. She was fired by Trump in the midst of the Trump/Zelenskiy matter.\n\nAccording to a White House record of the Trump/Zelenskiy July 25 phone call, Trump told Zelenskiy that Yovanovich was \u201cbad news\u201d and that she was \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d Yovanovich was considered highly respected in diplomatic circles but she reportedly tangled with Giuliani.\n\nRepublicans are demanding the committee release a transcript of former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\u2019s closed-door testimony last Thursday before Sondland and Yovanovich are deposed this week.\n\nOn Monday, Volker formally resigned from his role as Executive Director at the McCain Institute, hoping to end the distraction caused by questions surrounding documents he provided to investigators, including text messages with other members of the diplomatic community.\n\n\u201cToday, I informed ASU President Crow and Mrs. McCain that I believe the recent media focus on my work as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations risks becoming a distraction from the accomplishments and continued growth of the Institute, and therefore I am stepping down as Executive Director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership,\u201d Volker wrote in a statement.\n\nLast Friday, the State Department missed a deadline to turn over documents to the committee, but a House Foreign Affairs committee official said the State Department contacted the Committees, creating a level of hope the Department \u201cwill cooperate in full promptly.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also publicly pledged to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, though he dismissed it as a \u201csilly gotcha game.\u201d\n\n\u201cNations work together and they say \u2018Boy, goodness gracious, if you can help me with \u2018X,\u2019 we\u2019ll help you achieve \u2018Y,\u2019\u201d Pompeo told reporters while traveling in Greece. \u201cThis is what partnerships do. It\u2019s win-win. It\u2019s better for each of us.\u201d\n\nPompeo also defended the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, say it is the administration\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d to examine whether efforts to interfere in the 2016 election began in Ukraine.\n\nOn Sunday night, the president blasted the second whistleblower and suggested that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff could be guilty of treason due to their pursuit of the facts surrounding the matter. He also suggested that the lawmakers should be impeached, although the constitution does not allow members of Congress to be impeached. Lawmakers may be expelled from office by their fellow lawmakers \u2013 but not the president.\n\n....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the White House continues to insist that Trump \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d during his conversations with world leaders, and dismissed news that the second whistleblower spoke to the inspector general.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers about the same telephone call\u2014a call the President already made public\u2014it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he has done nothing wrong,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham noted.\n\nThis whistleblower, also described as a U.S. intelligence official, is believed to have first-hand knowledge of the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy, which could potentially remove one prong from the White House\u2019s strategic effort to discredit the first whistleblower, because that official only heard certain details about the Zelenskiy call second-hand.\n\nABC News\n\nA senior Democratic leadership aide said that there is continued discussion and analysis of whether a vote on the House floor to formally launch an impeachment inquiry would vote protect front-line Democrats.\n\nAs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos last week, there is some debate about whether to take the vote to take away GOP\u2019s complaint about restrictions on their rights in the minority and how it\u2019s been the precedent in other recent instances of impeachment in U.S. history.\n\nA senior House Democratic aide told ABC News that there is no requirement under the Constitution, House Rules or precedent that the House take a vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry. They argue that a full House vote would only be required on potential articles of impeachment, crafted by the Judiciary committee in the coming months.\n\nA floor vote to approve an impeachment inquiry was not on the table before lawmakers left town for a two-week recess, but Pelosi cracked open the door with her comments during an interview with Stephanopoulos last week, the aide said.\n\nAlthough there are no plans to schedule a floor vote next week, leadership will likely come together to scrutinize the level of risk in taking that vote when they return to the Capitol next Tuesday.\n\nABC News' Ben Siegel, John Santucci, Mike Levine, Jonathan Karl and Justin Fishel contributed to this report", "description": "The White House has not yet said whether President Trump was joking when he publicly encouraged China to launch a corruption investigation into former VP Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/zelenskiy-trump2-gty-ml-190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
