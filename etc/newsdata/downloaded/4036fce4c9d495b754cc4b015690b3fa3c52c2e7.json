He showed his readers how to profit off of companies that eventually went bust. In fact, his readers could have walked away with gains like 1,415% on Countrywide Financial, 4,408% on Fannie Mae, and even 6,425% on Freddie Mac.\n\nTo me, there\u2019s no one better to show you how to gain a huge advantage during market turbulence.\n\nI\u2019ll let Eric take it from here.\n\nJeff Remsburg\n\nTake Off Your Bear Market Blinders and Focus on These Propositions\n\nBy Eric Fry, Fry\u2019s Investment Report\n\n\n\nA few days before the epic stock market crash of 1929, the renowned economist Irving Fisher declared, \u201cStock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau \u2026 I expect to see the stock market a good deal higher within a few months.\u201d\n\nSeven decades after Fisher\u2019s infamous faux pas, another esteemed economist issued an equally misguided forecast. That economist was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n\nOn March 6, 2000, Greenspan assured a Boston College conference on the \u201cNew Economy\u201d that the internet-based economy would continue to foster productivity, technology innovation, and enduring wealth creation.\n\n\u201cI see nothing to suggest that these opportunities will peter out anytime soon,\u201d Greenspan predicted. \u201cIndeed, many argue that the pace of innovation will continue to quicken in the next few years as companies exploit the still largely untapped potential for e-commerce.\u201d\n\nAlas, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index topped out almost immediately after Greenspan stepped away from the podium.\n\nBut at the birth of the new millennium, Greenspan was not the only learned individual to predict a \u201cnew era\u201d of permanent prosperity. So did Washington Post columnist James Glassman and economist Kevin Hassett. In late 1999, the duo published the first edition of Dow 36,000, in which they predicted the Dow Jones Industrial Average would hit 36,000 within a few years.\n\nIt was not to be. This forecast was as inaccurate as it was audacious.\n\nWithin two years of Dow 36,000\u2018s arrival in bookstores, the Dow had slumped to less than 9,000. Even now, nearly 20 years later, the blue-chip average is trading for less than 27,000 \u2014 well below the 36,000 target.\n\nJust a few years after the 2000-\u201902 bear market took many investors by surprise, the stock market started fooling investors again. The housing boom of the mid-2000s was so intoxicating that many investors failed to recognize the ensuing bust until it was too late.\n\nDuring the run-up to the epic stock market collapse of 2008, professional Wall Street prognosticators were firing off errant forecasts like July 4 fireworks.\n\nIn November 2006, for example, Greenspan confidently declared, \u201cMost of the negatives in housing are probably behind us \u2026 A lot of people are going to lose their homes. It\u2019s a family tragedy. It\u2019s not an economic \u2014 or macroeconomic \u2014 tragedy.\u201d\n\nFive months later, Greenspan\u2019s successor, Ben Bernanke, doubled down on his predecessor\u2019s errant forecast by declaring, \u201cAt this juncture, the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 2007, signs of the coming housing bust were sprouting like red caps at a Donald Trump rally. But that troubling reality did not seem to trouble Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief investment strategist.\n\nStory continues", "description": "In yesterday's Digest, we began a new series from global investment strategist Eric Fry.
