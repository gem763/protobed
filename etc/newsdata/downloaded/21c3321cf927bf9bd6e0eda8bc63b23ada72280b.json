There were also unflattering portrayals in the media.\n\nZellweger said she understands some of the challenges Garland faced in the public eye, though not to the same degree. Growing up, Zellweger had not planned to be an actor, but an acting class at the University of Texas changed everything. A series of film roles led to the hit \"Jerry Maguire\" with Tom Cruise, and her career soared.\n\n\"I don't know. I don't remember much of my 30s,\" Zellweger said. \"Sounds like a joke, but it's true. But it just feels compressed. It feels like it just happened like that. So fast. I didn't want that to happen again.\"\n\nActress Ren\u00e9e Zellweger with correspondent Lee Cowan. CBS News\n\nShe told Cowan she needed to press the pause button on her acting career, but remained active off-camera. \"It was going by too fast,\" she said. \"And then I started to repeat myself.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation, Zellweger talks with Cowan about breaking into the business, her career, stepping back from making films for a while, and her return.\n\nShe also talks about the controversy over a 2014 red carpet appearance that created speculation about her perceived change of appearance, and her decision to go public about society's sexist double standards.\n\n\"At that point it had become necessary, not for me as an actress, but as a citizen or a person who was looking at the bigger picture of that, the implication of that,\" Zellweger said. \"It became necessary just to point at it, is all.\"\n\nZellweger said she is not sure anyone is born with the faculties to navigate fame and celebrity.\n\n\"I like normalcy, and I like genuine exchanges with people. I like to meet people,\" she said.\n\nBeing a celebrity, she said, changes that experience: \"Well, it enters the room before you do, and so any perception of who you might be, that's who they meet.\"\n\nTo watch a trailer for \"Judy,\" click on the video player below:\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning \"Sunday Morning\" is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET, and is rebroadcast on Pop TV at 12:30 p.m. ET/9:30 a.m. PT. \"Sunday Morning\" also streams on CBSN beginning at 9:30 a.m. ET and repeated at 1 p.m. ET, and is available on cbs.com, CBS All Access and On Demand.\n\nBe sure to follow us at cbssundaymorning.com, and on Twitter (@CBSSunday), Facebook, and Instagram (#CBSSundayMorning).", "description": "The Academy Award-winner says of celebrity, \"It enters the room before you do,\" altering the perception of her among anyone she meets", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/99323f6a-739c-440e-88d2-ad079c581638/thumbnail/1200x630/0773d4a7fc32fd17c94a1120cc211b55/renee-zellweger-interview-cbs-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
