Johnathan Thurston misses fan's $1MILLION kick", "language": "en", "text": "Rugby league legend Johnathan Thurston has missed a kick that could have won a fan $1million.\n\nThe former North Queensland Cowboys halfback was on the field at ANZ Stadium during the half time break of the NRL Grand Final with an opportunity to win some money for a fan.\n\nThurston's task was to kick the ball through a slot in a prop house in a Chemist Warehouse promotion called 'The House of Finals Half Time Kick'.\n\nSlots in different areas of the house were worth different sums of money, and if Thurston had found the top right section of the roof, the fan would have taken home a cool $1million.\n\nJohnathon Thurston (pictured) is angry with himself after missing a kick that could have won a fan $1million\n\nThe 36-year-old lined up his kick from near the 30-metre line as fan Jenny Brooks nervously watched on praying for a huge payout.\n\nThurston stepped in and sliced his kick badly to the right hand side, leaving Brooks devastated.\n\nChannel Nine commentators including Paul Gallen and Billy Slater were quick to rip into Thurston.\n\n'Well, he's folded on this stage before under pressure,' Slater said, referencing Thurston missing a conversion after the siren in the 2015 Grand Final.\n\nThurston was animated after the kick and clearly rattled by his poor attempt.\n\n'Have a look at him, he is filthy,' Paul Gallen said.\n\nJohnathon Thurston (pictured) lining up a promo kick with big cash prizes at the NRL Grand Final\n\n'He is so competitive that he is absolutely filthy on himself there.'\n\nThe commentators weren't the only ones bagging Thurston, with fans on Twitter ripping into the champion half for his lackluster effort.\n\nOne Tweet reads 'I'm 62, undertall, overweight and I reckon I could have kicked better than that.'\n\nThurston wasn't the only one filthy with a result on Grand Final day, with the Canberra Raiders being robbed by poor refereeing decisions in their 14-8 loss to the Sydney Roosters.\n\nHis missed kick didn't leave Ms Brooks empty-handed in the promotion, she received a novelty cheque for $5,000.", "description": "The former North Queensland Cowboys halfback was on the field at ANZ Stadium during the half time break of the NRL Grand Final with an opportunity to win some money for a fan.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/15/19362822-0-image-a-48_1570370773894.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
