The powerful storm was expected to near Florida late Tuesday.\n\nThe storm was \u201cshowing essentially no motion\u201d Monday afternoon, prolonging the battering of the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center said. It made landfall in Grand Bahama Island Sunday night after tearing through the Abaco Islands.\n\nThe storm is forecast to approach dangerously close to Florida late Tuesday through Wednesday, and then turn north, skirting the coast and coming perilously near Georgia and South Carolina Wednesday night and Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Hubert Minnis said Monday that the Royal Bahamas Police Force had confirmed five deaths in Abaco. \u201cTeams will go to Abaco as soon as possible for a full and proper assessment and identification,\u201d he said at a news conference Monday, adding that initial reports from the Abaco Islands are that \u201cdevastation is unprecedented and extensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that there are a number of people in Grand Bahama who are in serious distress,\u201d Mr. Minnis said. \u201cI strongly urge the residents of Grand Bahama to remain indoors and be as safe as possible until the all clear is given.\u201d\n\nAs many as 13,000 homes may have been severely damaged or destroyed, leaving many people without shelter, according to an initial assessment by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. In the Abaco Islands, extensive flooding likely contaminated wells with saltwater, the organization said. About 350,000 people live in the Bahamas, which consists of many islands, according to its 2010 census.\n\nAlthough Dorian wasn\u2019t projected to make landfall in Florida, federal forecasters warned that \u201conly a small deviation of the track toward the west would bring the core of the hurricane onshore,\u201d and that a life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds would extend far from the center, regardless of where it was positioned.\n\nDorian's Path Canada 2 p.m. Sat.

Sustained winds, which had reached 185 miles per hour Sunday, decreased to 140 mph Monday, the hurricane center said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you had to prepare for a hurricane or major storm? What helped you weather through it? Join the conversation below.\n\nBahamas Power & Light Co., which provides power to roughly 100,000 customers, saw a number of outages\u2014with power intentionally cut in some areas\u2014as a result of Dorian, including the accidental loss of power to the entire island of New Providence early Monday morning. Efforts to restore power to the island were hampered by flooding, the company said.\n\nThe Abaco Islands sustained \u201ccatastrophic damage,\u201d said Darren Henfield, the Bahamas minister of foreign affairs, in a video from the islands posted on ZNS Bahamas, which is operated by a state-owned broadcasting company.\n\nDorian has become the strongest hurricane on modern record to hit the northwestern Bahamas.

During a lull in the storm when the eye passed over, many residents headed to the complex to seek sanctuary. A clinic in the region was packed to capacity, he said.\n\nHow to Tell if a Hurricane Is Headed Your Way What you need to know about forecast maps and storm paths\n\nFootage aired on ZNS Bahamas showed homes, vehicles and lampposts almost submerged by flooding, and water sloshing inside a house, with sofas and other furniture bobbing around. Prime Minister Minnis said the downtown area of Grand Bahama was under three feet of water.\n\nMuch of the damage to homes in the Bahamas may not be covered by insurance. \u201cThe \u2018protection gap\u2019 in the region is significant,\u201d ratings firm A.M. Best Co. said in a June 2019 report on the Caribbean insurance industry. Of the estimated $32 billion overall economic loss in the Caribbean in 2017 from hurricanes, including Irma and Maria, only $5 billion was insured, representing a gap of more than 80%, Best said.\n\nIn Florida, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for low-lying and other at-risk areas in 12 counties, from Palm Beach in South Florida to Nassau on the Georgia border, according to the state\u2019s Division of Emergency Management. Other counties issued voluntary evacuation orders.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect from Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County to Ponte Vedra Beach in northern Florida. Jupiter residents reported getting rains from the hurricane\u2019s outer bands Monday afternoon. A wind gust of 43 mph was reported at Opa Locka Airport, near Miami, forecasters said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday the storm posed a serious threat to the state and urged residents to heed local officials\u2019 instructions. \u201cThe storm is stalling very close to our coast,\u201d he said. \u201cThe movement that it makes is going to have a lot of impact on Floridians.\u201d\n\nMr. DeSantis said 72 nursing homes and assisted-living facilities along the coast had been evacuated. Some hospitals also had begun evacuations, or planned to, he said.\n\nAlexis Garlini helped family friend Jack, who has medical issues, after she came with her mother to help evacuate him from the Fairlane Harbor Homes in Vero Beach, Fla. Photo: Gerald Herbert/Associated Press\n\nFlorida Power & Light Co. said Monday it had some 17,000 utility workers ready to respond to outages caused by Dorian.\n\n\u201cCustomers should stay vigilant as significant parts of our service territory remain within the cone of uncertainty,\u201d said Chief Executive Eric Silagy. \u201cThis is a challenging and very slow-moving storm.\u201d\n\nStates of emergency were in effect in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.\n\nAlong a coastal highway Monday afternoon on the barrier island near Melbourne, Fla.\u2014where an evacuation order was in effect\u2014almost all businesses were closed, many boarded up with plywood or metal shutters. Beachfront apartment buildings looked empty. Some people ambled along the beach, where the surf was getting rough.\n\nOne place that hadn\u2019t yet closed was Ichabod\u2019s Bar & Grille in Indialantic, where a crowd of patrons sat at the counter and on the patio. Stephen Hughey, a 42-year-old software engineer, said he had come to check out the beach before the hurricane.\n\nHe planned to ride out the storm with his wife and daughter at their home in Melbourne that is about 6 miles inland. He stocked up on food, alcohol and plenty of charcoal and propane to cook swordfish, steaks and lobster tails.\n\nShifting Paths Forecasts of Dorian\u2019s track have fluctuated in the past week, making it difficult to predict where, or if, the storm will make landfall in the U.S. Probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Monday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Aug. 27 forecast Storm location at 5 p.m. Monday 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s actual path 5 p.m. Aug. 27 Probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Monday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Aug. 27 forecast Storm location at 5 p.m. Monday 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s actual path 5 p.m. Aug. 27 Probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Monday Atlantic Ocean 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Aug. 27 forecast Storm location at 5 p.m. Monday 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s actual path 5 p.m. Aug. 27 Probable track area Projected path as of 5 p.m. Monday Monday\u2019s forecast Aug. 31 Atlantic Ocean Aug. 29 5 p.m. Aug. 29 Aug. 27 Storm location at 5 p.m. Monday 5 p.m. Aug. 31 Dorian\u2019s path 5 p.m. Aug. 27\n\n\u201cThis is a serious storm,\u201d said Mr. Hughey, a Florida native with hurricane experience. \u201cThe only saving grace is if it stays to its projected path\u201d off the coast.\n\nJaimie Moore, 52, a probation and parole officer whose home is only a half-mile inland, said he would scrutinize the storm forecast Tuesday and decide by noon whether to stay put or head to a friend\u2019s or family member\u2019s home on the mainland. He remained for Hurricane Irma two years ago and spent about five days without power. But Dorian threatens to come much closer.\n\n\u201cIf that eye comes on, as strong as it is, it\u2019s going to be bad,\u201d Mr. Moore said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued mandatory evacuation orders starting at noon on Monday for coastal residents in eight counties. The evacuations also applied to health-care facilities licensed by the state. He called for schools and government offices in those counties to close, starting Tuesday.\n\nLate Sunday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ordered an evacuation of six coastal counties starting at noon on Monday.\n\nAirports and airlines reacted to the latest hurricane forecasts, with Florida\u2019s main airports collectively canceling around 500 flights Monday. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International said it closed at noon until the same time on Tuesday, with Palm Beach International and a number of smaller airports also shuttering, though Miami International remained open.\n\nAirlines expect knock-on delays and cancellations to continue through the week, with big airport hubs in Orlando, Fla., Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., already set to cull more than 300 flights on Tuesday.\n\n\u2014Leslie Scism and Doug Cameron contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com and Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com", "description": "Hurricane Dorian hovered over the northwestern Bahamas Monday, killing at least five people, wiping out thousands of homes, forcing many into a makeshift shelter and leaving an entire island without power.
