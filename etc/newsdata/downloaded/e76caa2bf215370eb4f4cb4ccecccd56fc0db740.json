On Thursday, U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Peter Brown issued a statement taking responsibility for the president\u2019s out-of-date information. On Thursday, a source from the White House informed CNN that Trump had personally directed Brown to make this statement. The president was forcing a high-ranking military official to cover for him. On Friday evening, the NOAA released a peculiar, unsigned statement throwing the Alabama NWS under the bus for contradicting the president-who-shall-not-be-contradicted. (The NWS Employees Organization wasn\u2019t having it, and neither were many former NOAA officials, who professed themselves stunned.)\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy about all this is not that Trump is forcing the government to write him notes of excuse; that\u2019s old news by now. It\u2019s that his critics have not merely shrugged and gone away, and that even the fa\u00e7ade of his defense has shown cracks. It was a White House aide who revealed the John Roberts visit to the Oval Office, and, according to the Washington Post, it was a White House official who broke with the administration line to admit that the president of the United States had marked up an official NOAA map in order to avoid even a whiff of admitting fault.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lili Loofbourow", "Slate.Com News-And-Politics Trumps-Sharpie-Defense-Hurricane-Dorian.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
