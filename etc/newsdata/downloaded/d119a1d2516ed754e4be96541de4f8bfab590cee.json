The Diamondbacks had won 11 of 13 entering the series, but New York has shut them down completely, outscoring them 15-3 through the first three games. Right-hander Marcus Stroman (7-13, 3.42) will try to keep that domination going, although he hasn\u2019t been sharp since a July trade from Toronto.\n\nArizona will start lefty Alex Young (7-3, 3.38) in the finale. He gave up two hits and struck out 12 over eight innings in a 2-0 win over Cincinnati in his previous outing.\n\nCY-ZING IT UP\n\nJustin Verlander can enhance his Cy Young Award credentials when he starts for the AL West-leading Astros at Minute Maid Park against Oakland. Verlander tries for his major league-leading 19th win - he tops the AL with a 2.52 ERA and leads the majors with 200 innings. His 264 strikeouts are second to teammate Gerrit Cole\u2019s 281 for most in the big league.\n\nHomer Bailey (12-8, 4.87 ERA) has gone 3-0 with a 2.35 ERA over his last five starts. The A\u2019s hold a half-game edge over Cleveland for the second AL wild-card spot.\n\nREUNITED\n\nMookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts and the Red Sox hitters will try to bust a miserable slump against an old friend. Toronto\u2019s Clay Buchholz (1-4, 5.31) went 81-61 over 10 seasons with Boston, and he\u2019s slated to face his former teammates for the first time.\n\nThe Red Sox have dropped five straight and been shut out in two of their past three games since firing president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski. The skid includes a meager two-hit effort against four Blue Jays pitchers Wednesday night. Buchholz has a 3.57 ERA in three starts since ending a 3 1/2-month stint on the injured list with a sore shoulder.\n\nMINNESOTA MALADIES\n\nThe Twins were missing first baseman C.J. Cron (thumb), third baseman Miguel Sano (back), outfielder Max Kepler (shoulder) and infielder/outfielder Marwin Gonzalez (abdominal area) in their 6-2 loss to Washington on Wednesday night.\n\nThe AL Central leaders are continuing a cautious approach toward injuries, with outfielder Byron Buxton (shoulder) done for the season and Jake Cave (groin) still working his way back.\n\nHILLY ROAD\n\nDodgers lefty Rich Hill (4-1, 2.55 ERA) pitches in the majors for the first time since June 19. He\u2019s been out because of a forearm strain.\n\nHill starts for the NL West champions as they take on Baltimore at Camden Yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/diamondbacks_mets_baseball_08103_c0-111-2671-1668_s1770x1032.jpg?adaa22263d2024404a2293855793d2dbb8f68c3e", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
