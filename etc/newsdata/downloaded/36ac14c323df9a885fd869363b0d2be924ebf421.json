But nearly every lawmaker who spoke today took Zuckerberg to task over the company\u2019s past failures, calling on him and Facebook to make efforts to regain their trust before moving forward with the Libra project.\n\nAt the top of the House Financial Service Committee\u2019s hearing with Zuckerberg, Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) laid out her grievances with Facebook and expressed skepticism over the company\u2019s cryptocurrency plans. Whether it was the platform\u2019s role in Russian election interference in 2016 or its recent decision not to fact-check political ads, Waters suggested that Facebook has failed too many times on issues of national importance to be allowed to spearhead a risky new currency that could shake the international economy.\n\n\u201cWith all of these problems I have outlined, and given the company\u2019s size and reach, it should be clear why we have serious concerns about your plans to establish a global digital currency that would challenge the U.S. dollar,\u201d Waters said.\n\nIt\u2019s a criticism that Zuckerberg must have anticipated. In his prepared remarks, Zuckerberg said that he believes that Libra must be built, but he understands that Facebook isn\u2019t \u201cthe ideal messenger right now.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I\u2019m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.\u201d\n\nIn her line of questioning, Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-NY) asked Zuckerberg directly why he and Facebook should be trusted after years of privacy scandals related to data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica affair. \u201cDo you understand why this record makes us concerned with Facebook entering the cryptocurrency space? Do you realize that you and Facebook have a credibility issue here?\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said.\n\nElsewhere in the discussion, Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH) called out Zuckerberg over his lack of knowledge of diversity and housing advertisement issues at the company. Beatty quizzed Zuckerberg over reports that the committee had sent him, and she alleged that he had not read them at all. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you think this is a joke when you have ruined the lives of many people, discriminating against them,\u201d Beatty said.\n\n\u201cFair or not fair ... you\u2019re here today to answer for the digital age\u201d\n\nThe top Republican on the committee, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), broadened the scope of his criticisms to cover the entire tech industry, not just Facebook. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger out there, and now, it\u2019s being directed at the architects of the system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFair or not fair,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019re here today to answer for the digital age.\u201d\n\nIn answers to lawmakers on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that Facebook wouldn\u2019t agree to move forward on the Libra project until all of the US regulatory bodies involved gave it a green light. But even that statement came under fire, with members like Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) demanding Zuckerberg list out all of the regulators he would seek approval from to ensure none are left out. (He did not provide a full list.)\n\nIf the Libra Association decided to move forward without this regulatory approval, Zuckerberg confirmed that Facebook \u201cwould be forced to leave the Association.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers, including Waters and Rep. Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda (D-IL), even suggested that Facebook\u2019s repeated violations of privacy and user trust calls into question whether the company should be broken up entirely, something 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for as well.\n\nThe voices of lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee today joined a growing chorus of Congress members who have criticized Facebook. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of policymakers, including Mark Warner (D-VA) and Josh Hawley (R-MO), have gone after Big Tech companies over issues related to social media addiction, privacy, and security. New bills aimed at regulating the tech industry have been introduced at a faster rate than in years prior. It\u2019s clear that Facebook and Big Tech are under more scrutiny than ever before in Congress. Now, the industry is seen as a growing threat that needs to be reined in, rather than set free.\n\nThere are already a number of antitrust investigations open into Facebook. Shortly after it settled with the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy scandals, Facebook announced that it is being probed by the agency again over potential antitrust violations. Nearly every state attorney general in the country is working in tandem to investigate the company for anti-competitive behavior, and the House Judiciary Committee is, too.\n\n\u201cWe earn credibility drop by drop,\u201d Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-PA) told Zuckerberg at the tail end of the hearing. \u201cBut we pour it away in buckets.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much that Congress can do to stop Facebook from moving forward with its cryptocurrency plans, however. Earlier this year, Waters called for Facebook to halt the development of Libra until policymakers could develop some kind of regulatory framework. At the time, a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge that the company was looking \u201cforward to responding to lawmakers\u2019 questions as this process moves forward,\u201d but did not agree to stop development. Lawmakers pressed Zuckerberg on that same issue on Wednesday, and he responded by saying that he believed congressional oversight of the financial regulators is enough.\n\nIf US regulators approve Libra in the near future, Facebook will roll it out worldwide without that blessing from Congress.", "description": "At the top of the House Financial Service Committee\u2019s hearing with Zuckerberg, Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) laid out her grievances with Facebook and expressed skepticism over the company\u2019s cryptocurrency plans.
