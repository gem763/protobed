Supporting Charging infrastructure and technology\n\nIt\u2019s convenience of traditional fuel vs time taken to charge the battery.\n\nYou can tank full your car in maximum 5 minutes whereas even a puny phone battery takes minimum one hour (with latest technologies) to charge. Plus you add the uncertainty associated with the Indian traffic and now think for yourself \u2013 how comfortable are you to make a switch ?\n\nCompanies can set up fast-charging stations but with current charging time (of minimum one hour), one can imagine how long the queues would be.\n\nYou can charge overnight, go through most of your days and still left stuck on some days. EVs in their current form need extreme discipline....\n\nTo resolve this we need a significant technology breakthrough \u2013 the way you have seen in sci-fi movies\n\nVery-2 fast charge \u2013 closer to traditional fuel timings; or\n\nSelf-charging batteries \u2013 similar to what happens with current 12v batteries; or\n\nThe extensive and quick battery replacement network\n\nIn today\u2019s age of hyperloops and personal moon missions, I am more optimistic about the first two. Timing no one knows.\n\n2. Set off for govt taxes\n\nOne needs to also factor in how much revenue government makes from fuel taxes. How will that get compensated from EVs?\n\nIn FY19, the Centre collected Rs 2.6-lakh crore by levying taxes on the petroleum products. A significant portion of this comes from the fuel used for the running of vehicles. Besides, state governments also have revenue interests from the fuel products. Even Goods and Services Tax (GST) couldn\u2019t happen so far on fuel products because of the state revenue implications.\n\nThe government to compensate for this loss would need to create a mix between higher upfront costs and the annual recurring taxes (something like property taxes). Again this is something that needs to be worked upon and needs time for wider acceptance by the regulators and the consumers.\n\n3. Why are global companies investing in the fuel distribution infrastructure in India?\n\nYes, it\u2019s true. I am sure you would have read the following news \u2013\n\nIn August 2019, Reliance Industries (NS: ) and British Petroleum ( BP (LON: )) announced that they are setting up a joint venture to operate fuel retailing business, targeting expanding number of filling stations to 5,500 in five years and offer home delivery of fuel.\n\n(NS: ) and British Petroleum ( (LON: )) announced that they are setting up a joint venture to operate fuel retailing business, targeting expanding number of filling stations to 5,500 in five years and offer home delivery of fuel. The government is working on easing the fuel retailing norms \u2013 the potential beneficiaries could be foreign energy giants such as Saudi Aramco, Total and Trafigura.\n\nIs this not counter-intuitive? Why would these giants invest in a business with a remaining shelf life of 5-10 years?\n\nIn the end, I believe a lot of trials and errors will keep on happening. The fact remains \u2013 the technology needs to stabilize and capital costs need to come down. A lot of this would depend upon what is trending globally.\n\nWe as a Country need to provide the right environment to incentivize the research and make a smooth switch.\n\nWho questions much, shall learn much, and retain much - Francis Bacon Disclosure: These are my personal views and the reader should do his own independent research before making any investment-related decision.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Nitin Jain covering: BP PLC, Reliance Industries Ltd.
