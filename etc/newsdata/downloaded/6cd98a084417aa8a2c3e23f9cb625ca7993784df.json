Indonesia imported 413,813 tonnes of fabrics in 2018, it said.\n\nImports of other textile products, such as some types of synthetic yarns doubled in three years to 2018, the ministry said.\n\nIndonesia bought such products from China, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, among others, the ministry said.\n\nA company belonging to Indonesia's Duniatex group last month missed a coupon payment on its $300 million bonds as it faces a cash shortage resulting from tough competition with imported products.\n\nIndonesia's customs office also said that an increasing volume of smuggled used clothing had been found. The country does not allow imports of second-hand garments.\n\nThe API also hopes the government would relax textile and garment industry rules to help local businesses boost their exports.\n\n\"We are encouraging our members, who so far are more orinted to local markets, to become more export oriented,\" said Anne Patricia Sutanto, deputy chair of API.\n\nShe said should the government ease export regulations, local textile producers could boost exports eight-fold in the next ten years.\n\nIndonesia in 2018 exported $13.2 billion worth of textile goods.", "description": "Indonesia to tighten textile import rules following influx of goods: official", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
