All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s ellipses led on to a familiar litany of self-praise that included his two Supreme Court picks and the specious claim that he has \u201cdone more than any President in first 2 1/2 years,\u201d before concluding with an oddly punctuated fragment \u2014 \u201cWIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey..\u201d \u2014 whose meaning is clearly best understood by those in red MAGA hats.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was in response to a vote Thursday in the House Judiciary Committee to establish rules for eventual hearings that could, in theory, lead to the president\u2019s possible impeachment and ultimately his potential removal from office.\n\nThis is, clearly, a hypothetical scenario. But while Democrats remain divided on whether to pursue impeachment ahead of the 2020 election, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., summed up the committee majority\u2019s view that the ground rules resolution was a \u201cnecessary next step in our investigation of corruption, obstruction and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nNadler didn\u2019t mention the \u201cgreatest economy\u201d or the low unemployment figures for \u201cBlacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women,\u201d apparently unpersuaded by Trump\u2019s conviction that those are all that matter. Nadler\u2019s view would seem to be supported by the Constitution, which specifies impeachment for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d without an exception based on employment data or the stock market averages.\n\nOne person who disagrees with Trump\u2019s formulation is Gregory Cheadle, who was singled out by Trump at a campaign rally in Redding, Calif., on June 3, 2016, as \u201cmy African-American.\u201d On Thursday, Cheadle made headlines by announcing he was leaving the Republican Party, in part because he has come to conclude that the president is a white supremacist.\n\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump talks to Gregory Cheadle in 2016. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) More\n\n\u201cWhen you look at his appointments for the bench: white, white, white, white, white, white, white,\u201d Cheadle told NPR. \u201cThat to me is really damning to everybody else because no one else gets a chance because he\u2019s thinking that the whites are superior, period.\u201d\n\nAsked about Cheadle\u2019s defection on Thursday as he departed for a speech in Baltimore \u2014 the city he described during his feud with Rep. Elijah Cummings as \u201ca disgusting rat and rodent-infested mess\u201d \u2014 Trump said he had no recollection of the man. He went on to boast about how much black people like him.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous African-American support.\u201d said Trump, who received just 8 percent of the African-American vote in 2016. A CNN poll released this week showed him with an approval rating among black women of 3 percent.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s world, the boundary between truth and falsehood is often blurred.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump lashed out at an ABC News/Washington Post poll showing his approval rating falling 6 points in two months to just 38 percent. He explained it away by alleging conspiracy.", "description": "\"How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country?\" Trump asked on Twitter.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lWIg0d.TVHY2xBdqX55raw--~B/aD0zNDA0O3c9NTEwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/fdd785d0-d662-11e9-bff6-e4aa9b24f79b", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
