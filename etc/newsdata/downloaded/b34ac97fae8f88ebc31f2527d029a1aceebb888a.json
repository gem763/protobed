In the Australia retail and commercial division, revenue fell to $9.6 billion, from $10.2 billion in 2018. But the institutional bank performed better, with revenue rising 5 per cent over the year to $5.2 billion. Overall expenses were flat.\n\n\"At face value, cost discipline looks to be a pleasing element of the result,\" said Morgans senior banks analyst Azib Khan.\n\nThe net interest margin (NIM) contracted during the second half by 8 basis points; lower interest rates caused most of the squeeze, partially offset by lower wholesale funding costs. Even though banks held back some of the Reserve Bank's October cut in the official cash rate to protect margins, analysts say other banks will also be facing similar margin pressures to ANZ given deposit rates are so low.\n\n\"NIM pressure is coming faster than we expected,\" said Matthew Wilson, senior research analyst at Evans & Partners.\n\n'Sad reality'\n\nCustomer remediation bills spiked to $485 million in the second half, as announced to the market earlier in October, to a cumulative $1.6 billion pre-tax. Mr Elliott said cleaning up after the royal commission had been a \"big drain on resources\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The sad reality is that we have a lot of things to fix up, not just from the royal commission but in terms of ongoing remediations. That takes a lot of our very bright people, takes a lot of money and technology resource,\" he said.\n\nANZ reported a common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 11.4 per cent, which was flat. With the market expecting action by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will force ANZ to lift capital levels, the bank said it \"is in a strong capital position with organic generation capacity\" and the board would consider \"further capital management actions once any regulatory changes are known in the coming months\".\n\nInvestment spending increased by 17 per cent to $1.4 billion, from $1.2 billion last year. The bank found productivity benefits of around $260 million, which it said was driven by simplification, improvements to process and selling international property.\n\nCredit quality improved overall, with gross impaired assets falling to $2.03 billion from $2.14 billion a year earlier. However, charts in the investor pack show a tick-up in the number of mortgages where repayments are more than 90 days overdue, rising over the past six months to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion, or 1.16 per cent of the total portfolio. The total provision charge for the year was up 16 per cent to $795 million, but lower than 2016 and 2017, while the overall loss rate increased by 1 basis point to 13 basis points.\n\nANZ's funding and liquidity position is strong, with an average liquidity coverage ratio at 143 per cent for the second half and a net stable funding ratio at 116 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty,\" Mr Elliott said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, he said ANZ has \"a very strong balance sheet, so we\u2019ve got a lot of capital and we continue to be profitable. And part of that\u2019s because of our international business, New Zealand and institutional, have held up their earnings very well. So that\u2019s enabled us to maintain the dividend overall - but not maintain the level of franking.\"\n\nHe said challenging trading conditions to continue, while \"record low interest rates and intense competition will continue to impact profitability\".\n\nANZ is also more exposed to global trade ructions than other major banks; Mr Elliott said \u201cgeopolitical tensions will also place pressure on earnings given our exposure to global trade, although this can be managed through the diversification of our business.\"", "description": "Lower interest rates squeezed earnings in ANZ's retail bank as it reduced the franking level of its dividend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2518%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_153%2C$y_90/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8fa49303830aec498338a8f0cca5e220b56ef1ee", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
