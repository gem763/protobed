For while Mother Nature brandishes a paintbrush over the northern hemisphere\u2019s most beautiful woodlands, it\u2019s also the time when tour operators, hotels and airlines send prices falling along with the leaves.\n\nAs October clicks in, \u2018leaf peeping\u2019 adventures \u2014 the term coined by our friends across the Pond to describe seeking out the season\u2019s boldest colours \u2014 are increasingly popular\n\nBut how can you tell if we\u2019re poised for a cracker when it comes to colour?\n\nThere are, explains National Trust gardener Toby Yorke, a few factors that can predict whether a showstopper is on its way. He says: \u2018Throughout the year, factors such as temperature, moisture and sunlight all contribute to the vibrancy of the colours.\n\n\u2018A wet spring and a hot summer, followed by sunny autumn days and frosty nights, usually make for a dazzling leaf display.\u2019\n\nThe science behind the colour wheel is that chlorophyll, the pigment that gives leaves their greenness, ebbs away as shorter days and cooler temperatures set in.\n\nOther pigments \u2014 copper, amber and crimson \u2014 formerly masked by chlorophyll, start to shine through, boosted by surging sugar concentrations. When those nutrients have gone, the leaves drop.\n\nNorth America would waltz off annually with gold in the leaf peeping Olympics \u2014 few destinations can conjure up the bewitching \u2018fall\u2019 foliage that Vermont or New Hampshire can \u2014 but Japan\u2019s autumn, koyo, is a close rival. The country\u2019s many sub-species of maple create a scarlet mosaic that endures until early December.\n\nWhile Mother Nature brandishes a paintbrush over the northern hemisphere\u2019s most beautiful woodlands, autumn is also the time when tour operators, hotels and airlines send prices falling along with the leaves\n\nIf only a shorter \u2014 and more affordable \u2014 break will do, Britain\u2019s woodlands are just as soul-lifting, especially when days are bookended by a hearty breakfast and a cosy rural pub.\n\nAround 13 per cent of our own land is covered by trees, with everything from orchards to medieval royal hunting forests and formal avenues, such as the soaring limes in London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Park.\n\nIts cloak of green is already being shrugged off in favour of warmer hues, says Alan Power, head gardener at the National Trust\u2019s 18th-century Stourhead estate in Wiltshire, who argues autumn is the best season to be among nature.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s my favourite time of year, and you can feel the change coming as early as late August,\u2019 he adds.\n\n\u2018At Stourhead, the yellow buckeye tree next to the Pantheon is usually the first to turn, followed by the red oaks, golden beeches, yellow tulip trees and a host of other species that create a vivid natural tapestry.\u2019\n\nThe curtain is just about to rise on autumn 2019.
