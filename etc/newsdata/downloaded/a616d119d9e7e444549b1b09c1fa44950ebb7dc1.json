They want us to go back to the land, toiling in back-breaking jobs, suffering pain without the relief of Big Pharma, old at 30 and dead at 40.\n\nThe latest fad in this race to barbarism is the concept of \"rewilding\" that has recently been crowbarred into The Archers, a long-running BBC radio soap about everyday rural folk. At first it struck me as totally unfeasible that a conservative-minded old lady would give half a million pounds to such a right-on reimagining of the fictional Ambridge landscape.\n\nBut rewilding is an attempt to literally go back in time, to before when pesky people and their petty desires to have a decent standard of living caused human habitats to blight the landscape.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the more spirited working-class characters in the show see it as a rich woman's whim; ostensibly a caring, sharing project, rewilding is inherently human-hating, starting out with letting a few weeds have their way and ending up with carnivorous beasts roaming our high streets. Two words - Jurassic Park.\n\nHearing the overprivileged and under-productive halfwits of Extinction Rebellion talk about economic growth as if it were child abuse, you sense real contempt towards people who believe working at a job to make money and pay the taxes that keep society civil is a desirable thing to do.\n\nBut perhaps this is understandable when you consider no protest movement has ever featured so many double-barrelled names or Instagram skiing trips, while demonising air travel for the masses.\n\nThey need a song - civil rights marchers had We Shall Overcome and the Vietnam War opponents had The Fixin' To Die Rag - so may I suggest the No\u00ebl Coward number Why Do The Wrong People Travel?\n\n\"What explains this mass mania to leave Pennsylvania/And clack around like flocks of geese/Demanding dry martinis on the isles of Greece/In the smallest street, where the gourmets meet/They invariably fetch up/And it's hard to make them accept a steak/That isn't served rare and smeared with ketchup...\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the risk of being alarmist - it's catching - I found it fitting that the red paint doubled back and covered the idiot protesters at one point.\n\nBecause the blood of all those who die in the fetid swamp of a preindustrial society will be on their hands if they ever succeed in the rewilding of society - with all the savagery that the word implies.\n\nThe Telegraph London", "description": "No protest movement has ever featured so many double-barrelled names or Instagram skiing trips, while demonising air travel for the masses, writes Julie Burchill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2634%2C$y_1296/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1549c2652d19a14d03a6f44db64554ccb57bcbe2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
