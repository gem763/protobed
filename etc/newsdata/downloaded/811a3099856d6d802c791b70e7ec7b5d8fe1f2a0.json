REUTERS/Susana Vera\n\nWong, who was 17 when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement, has not been a prominent figure in the current anti-government protests, which are largely leaderless, in the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nHowever, the bespectacled Wong, now 23, holds a high profile internationally and described his disqualification - on the grounds that advocacy of Hong Kong\u2019s self-determination violates electoral laws - as \u201cpolitical censorship\u201d.\n\nProtests, which started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have evolved into calls for greater democracy. They have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades, taken a heavy toll on the economy and show little sign of letting up.\n\nThey have also posed the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nWong said he was the only person disqualified out of more than 1,100 candidates in district council elections set for November.\n\nSuch votes have previously attracted little fanfare and been dominated by pro-Beijing candidates. But a summer of unrest has infused a new significance in the poll and prompted a record number of candidates and voters to register.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government said in a statement one candidate was deemed invalid because they fell foul of electoral laws prohibiting \u201cadvocating or promoting \u2018self-determination\u2019\u201d. It did not identify Wong by name.\n\nWong has said he supported the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong\u2019s future but that he is against independence, according to a post on his Facebook page on Saturday.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong shops shutter as months of protest darken economic gloom\n\n\u2018VERY GRIM\u2019\n\nWong\u2019s disqualification followed another weekend of protests that descended into chaotic clashes with police.\n\nBlack-clad and masked demonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs, while residents in the working-class district of Mongkok poured on to the streets to hurl abuse at police officers sent to subdue the protesters.\n\nEmbattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she expected the Asian financial hub to record negative economic growth this year, in part as a result of the unrest.\n\n\u201cOur current assessment is that the full year of 2019 will likely show negative growth, which means we won\u2019t be able to achieve the already revised down positive growth of 0-1%,\u201d Lam said. \u201cThe situation is very grim\u201d.\n\nLam\u2019s gloomy forecast came two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had fallen into recession and was unlikely to achieve any growth this year.\n\nA preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday was expected to show two successive quarters of contraction - the technical definition of a recession.\n\nBeijing-backed Lam said the government would unveil new measures to boost the economy once the unrest died down, without giving any details.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they view as increasing interference by Beijing in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nTourist numbers have plummeted, with visitor numbers down nearly 50 percent in October, record declines in retail sales, rising unemployment and bankruptcies.", "description": "Hong Kong's government disqualified prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong from upcoming district elections on Tuesday, a move likely to sow further discord in a city hit by five months of anti-government unrest.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446074225&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S09B", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
