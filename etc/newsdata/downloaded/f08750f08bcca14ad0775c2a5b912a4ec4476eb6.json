But also the staff in and around the place.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s been my mentor. From my injury in 2003 at least, I was making all the notes, what he did in different, certain situations. Of course I\u2019ve already been in touch with him, because there\u2019s no one better to get some advice from.\u2019\n\nLiverpool have not won at Old Trafford in five years and Solskjaer must continue that run (Getty)\n\nUnfortunately for Solskjaer, United\u2019s poor form has meant he\u2019s had to borrow Ferguson\u2019s \u2018hairdryer treatment\u2019 more recently, laying into his players after their last defeat to Newcastle.\n\nWhile another loss \u2013 even a heavy won \u2013 against Liverpool at Old Trafford is not expected to be fatal to Solskjaer\u2019s United career, anything but three points in the subsequent match against Norwich could see his time at the club come to a premature end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Sir Alex Ferguson made an appearance at Manchester United\u2019s training ground on Saturday and spent time chatting to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and assistant Michael Carrick.
