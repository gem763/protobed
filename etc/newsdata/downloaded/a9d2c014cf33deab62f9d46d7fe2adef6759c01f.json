Rather than the elliptical orbit that objects in our own solar system have as they fly around the Sun, the new object's movement has a hyperbolic shape, suggesting it is on a journey through the solar system rather than around it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Scientists still know very little about the unusual object, and its strange behaviour was so unusual that it even led some to suggest it could actually be an alien spacecraft.\n\nIf the new object is in fact another interstellar visitor, it could shed light on that mysterious object. And it would mark a major breakthrough in our understanding of how such objects are flung through the universe.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He posted the possible discovery online and other researchers rushed to confirm it.\n\nIt has now been spotted through other observations, which have allowed astronomers to learn more about it. That extra work did indeed suggest that it was another visitor to our solar system, prompting Harvard's Minor Planet Center to release an official report on the object.\n\n\"Based on the available observations, the orbit solution for this object has converged to the hyperbolic elements shown below, which would indicate an interstellar origin,\" it wrote. \"A number of other orbit computers have reached similar conclusions, initially D. Farnocchia (JPL), W. Gray, and D. Tholen (UoH).\n\n\"Further observations are clearly very desirable, as all currently-available observations have been obtained at small solar elongations and low elevations. Absent an unexpected fading or disintegration, this object should be observable for at least a year.\"\n\nOne of the things that made 'Oumuamua so inscrutable to scientists was that it was spotted on its way out of the solar system, giving them only a very limited time to make any observations of it. The new object looks as if it will be around for longer, giving astronomers much more of an opportunity to try and understand what it is and where it came from.\n\nFor now, the object is called C/2019 Q4 (Borisov), the Minor Planet Center said. Further observations will be required to confirm that it is indeed an interstellar traveller, at which point it will be given an updated name.\n\nMichele Bannister, a scientist from Queen's University Belfast who worked on the discovery and examination of Oumuamua, tweeted to warn that objects with similar orbits had been spotted before \u2013 and then found to be more normal than we had realised.\n\n\"This is not the first object since 2017/1I, better known as \u02bbOumuamua, to show a hyperbolic orbit,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Several short-arcs have flourished and slid slowly into the demise of straightforward parabolas.\n\n\"What it took? More observations.\"\n\nAstronomers have long said that more visitors should be spotted fairly regularly in the future, and that they will finally help us understand where these objects are coming from and how unusual they are. In 2022, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be switched on and allow them to see many more, they hope.\n\n\u201cIn the next 10 years, we expect to begin seeing more objects like \u2018Oumuamua. The LSST will be leaps and bounds beyond any other survey we have in terms of capability to find small interstellar visitors,\u201d said Matthew Knight, an associate research scientist in the University of Maryland\u2019s department of astronomy, earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe may start seeing a new object every year. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll start to know whether \u2018Oumuamua is weird, or common. If we find 10-20 of these things and \u2018Oumuamua still looks unusual, we\u2019ll have to re-examine our explanations.\u201d", "description": "Astronomers might have spotted an interstellar visitor to our solar system, for only the second ever time.
