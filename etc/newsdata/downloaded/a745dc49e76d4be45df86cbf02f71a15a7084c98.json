(Kathryn Riley/Getty Images)\n\nUNCASVILLE, Conn. \u2014 With 2\u00bd minutes left in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, Elena Delle Donne leaned forward ever so slightly and gingerly placed her hands on her knees, grimacing a bit from back discomfort that left her status in doubt until shortly before tip-off Sunday afternoon.\n\nMoments earlier, the Washington Mystics\u2019 6-foot-5 forward had driven authoritatively to the rim and banked in a shot to blunt a rally by the Connecticut Sun, blocking out the pain of a herniated disk to score another critical basket during a performance that coaches and teammates called nothing short of heroic.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got some guts,\u201d Mystics Coach Mike Thibault said.\n\nEven in her compromised state, the reigning league MVP managed 13 points on 5-for-6 shooting with six rebounds, one assist and one block to spark a 94-81 triumph that leaves the Mystics one victory from their first WNBA championship.\n\n[Mystics top Sun, take 2-1 lead in WNBA Finals]\n\nThat Delle Donne played at all, much less the 26 minutes she was able to provide, left teammates marveling at her moxie, particularly during some of the most significant moments in the game when Washington\u2019s comfortable margin appeared to be slipping away.\n\nTake, for instance, when the Sun drew within 55-53 with 5:07 to play in the third quarter. On the Mystics\u2019 ensuing possession, Delle Donne collected a pass from guard Kristi Toliver and calmly sank one of her three three-pointers, part of Washington\u2019s 16-for-27 shooting from beyond the arc.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to how much this means to her,\u201d Mystics guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough said. \u201cTo see her go out like that makes us go that much harder, not just for our team, but for her as well. It lifts us up a whole bunch. We don\u2019t really know how much pain she\u2019s in, but we know what she has is serious, so for her to put that aside and come out there for us, it means a lot.\u201d\n\nDelle Donne said she had no idea whether she would be able to play when she arrived at Mohegan Sun Arena roughly three hours before tip-off. The franchise cornerstone had been nursing the back injury she suffered in Tuesday\u2019s Game 2 for most of the week. She received treatment daily, almost around the clock, and when she wasn\u2019t on the training table, she rested as best she could.\n\n\u201cBasically doing anything possible to get back out there,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cWe have a really great medical staff, phenomenal doctors, great trainers, so they\u2019ve been working on me for five days straight. I was glad to have a little bit of a break to get it to calm down a little bit, just trying to find ways to stay comfortable.\u201d\n\nThe two-time MVP did not participate in basketball-related activities until a light shoot-around Sunday afternoon with athletic trainer Chalisa Fonza observing. Still, Thibault said he woke up Sunday morning assuming there was virtually \u201czero\u201d chance of Delle Donne being ready.\n\nNot only did Delle Donne play, but the six-time all-star also was in the starting lineup as usual, helping Washington race to a 17-point lead in the first quarter in front of an announced sellout crowd of 9,170.\n\n\u201cIt shows you the player and the person she is,\u201d center LaToya Sanders said. \u201cIt shows you how much she wants this, not just for the team, but for herself. She\u2019s been to the Finals a couple times. She\u2019s a team player. It gave us that edge, just play for the family.\u201d\n\nOnce it became clear Delle Donne would be available, the plan, according to Thibault, was to play her in four- to five-minute increments and then allow her to catch her breath while standing behind the bench or keep her back loose by peddling on a nearby exercise bicycle.\n\nThibault also modified Delle Donne\u2019s defensive assignment in Game 3, moving her onto Sun 6-2 forward Alyssa Thomas rather than 6-6 center Jonquel Jones, who had 32 points and 18 rebounds in Connecticut\u2019s 99-87 win in Game 2 in Washington.\n\nDelle Donne had hurt her back early in Game 2 while jostling for a rebound and almost immediately signaled to the bench that she needed to come out. She played just 3\u00bd minutes, and Washington missed her defense about as much as her elite scoring ability.\n\nThis time, Thibault had Sanders defending Jones, who was limited to nine points and nine rebounds. Sanders, at 6-3, is among the most skilled post defenders in the league, and she was able to frustrate Jones with her length, denying entry passes from Sun guards.\n\nThomas had just 13 points on 6-for-13 shooting, also bothered by Delle Donne\u2019s length. Maryland\u2019s career leader in points and rebounds scored her fewest points in the WNBA Finals after having averaged 20.5 over the first two games.\n\n\u201cI mean, what more can you ask?\u201d guard Natasha Cloud said of Delle Donne. \u201cWhat more kind of fuel do you need added to the fire? You\u2019ve got your MVP pushing through pain, and that makes you want to play for the player next to you even more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our team. That\u2019s the family that we have, that they\u2019re willing to put their bodies on the line to be successful and make this team successful, and it worked out.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNo one has more WNBA victories than Mike Thibault. He\u2019s still looking for his first title.\n\nLaToya Sanders has found her place as Mystics\u2019 glue player after years outside WNBA\n\nWhen the Mystics go to work, even in the WNBA Finals, it\u2019s business casual\n\nThe WNBA season started with big questions. It\u2019s ending with hope from smaller successes.", "description": "Even in her compromised state, the league MVP managed 13 points in 26 minutes while impressing teammates with her moxie.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football", "October At Pm", "Gene Wang Is A Sports Reporter Covering Multiple Beats", "Including Virginia", "Virginia Tech Football", "Basketball", "The Wizards", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wstjkxqtlPer9JCCYxlmjneOUDU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIUDQOXIRQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
