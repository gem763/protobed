But not everyone is celebrating the sketch comedy show\u2019s decision to part with the comic.\n\nSeveral prominent comedians, including SNL alums Rob Schneider and Norm Macdonald, slammed the NBC show for reversing course on Gillis, one of three new featured players the series announced just this past Thursday.\n\nOne of the first comics to publicly come to Gillis\u2019s defense was Schneider, who joined \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as a writer in the late 1980s and was a cast member from 1990 to 1994. \u201cAs a former SNL cast member I am sorry that you had the misfortune of being a cast member during this era of cultural unforgiveness where comedic misfires are subject to the intolerable inquisition of those who never risked bombing onstage themselves,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSchneider, who in recent years has been critical of the show that made him famous, suggested a suspension might have been more appropriate for Gillis. But it was unclear how much of Gillis\u2019s podcast commentary Schneider \u2014 who has been criticized for employing racial stereotypes in his own comedy \u2014 had heard.\n\nLast thought on this @Shanemgillis\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between exposing truths through Free Speech and just being ugly.\n\nIt\u2019s not okay to say racist things under the guise of comedy. Just because you have a mic in your hand doesn\u2019t make the racist things you say any less racist. \u2014 Rob Schneider (@RobSchneider) September 17, 2019\n\nMost of the comments that found Gillis under fire last week did not take place in a stand-up setting but on \u201cMatt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast,\u201d which the comic co-hosted with his friend Matt McCusker. Controversy erupted after a journalist shared a clip of one 2018 episode that featured the duo using racist slurs against Chinese people and mocking their accents. Gillis has also been criticized for remarks he made as a guest on other podcasts \u2014 one of which featured him using an anti-Semitic and racist slur to reference Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang.\n\nShane Gillis reached out. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 16, 2019\n\nYang notably defended Gillis after Vice reported the comic\u2019s repeated use of the slur in a May podcast recording. He tweeted that he did not support Gillis losing his job and offered to meet with the comic. Hours after SNL said Gillis would not be joining the show\u2019s upcoming 45th season, Yang tweeted that the meeting may soon take place. The presidential hopeful has faced some criticism for his approach to the controversy. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to let Shane Gillis off the hook so he can cater to other voters that he needs to get to the White House,\u201d Jenn Fang, creator of the Asian American advocacy blog Reappropriate, told the New York Times.\n\nShane Gillis reached out. Looks like we will be sitting down together soon. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 16, 2019\n\nNorm Macdonald, who spent five seasons on SNL in the 1990s, made it clear he was unhappy with the decision. \u201cOf course you know, this means WAR,\u201d the former \u201cWeekend Update\u201d anchor tweeted alongside a Variety article about Gillis\u2019s eclipsed SNL debut. He also tagged Gillis in an apologetic tweet.\n\n@Shanemgillis Hey, Shane, I'm so sorry. I can't even imagine how you must feel. The work it takes to get that show and to have it snatched away by some guy who does \"Spoken Bird\" poetry. Unacceptable. Please DM me, pal, when you have a moment. I'm so sorry. \u2014 Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) September 16, 2019\n\nSasheer Zamata, who quietly left SNL in 2017 after four seasons, told BuzzFeed\u2019s AM2DM that comedians should be able to say what they want \u2014 with a caveat: \u201cSay whatever you want, but you also have to know that the audience is going to feel how they feel, and they also have a right to say what they want to say.\u201d\n\nOn his Comedy Central talk show Monday, fellow SNL veteran David Spade said he preferred \u201cto stay out of the fray,\u201d deferring to two of his \u201cLights Out With David Spade\u201d guests: comedians Jim Jefferies and Bill Burr.\n\n\u201cThis is just cancel culture. The guy shouldn\u2019t have been fired,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a couple things back in his history \u2014 are we going to go back through everyone\u2019s history? Or are we going to get rid of every sketch that SNL has done that involves race?\u201d\n\nJefferies referenced Samurai Futaba, a character John Belushi played in the mid- to late \u201970s. Belushi spoke mock Japanese and made exaggerated use of a katana for the recurring role, which was also referenced by some social media users who saw a double standard in SNL\u2019s decision to fire Gillis.\n\nSNL has indeed rankled viewers with questionable racial humor over the years. Ching Chang, a caricature Dana Carvey debuted in 1986 but performed as recently as 2000, was also cited. In a more recent example, the show infamously tapped Fred Armisen \u2014 who is of Venezuelan, German and Korean descent \u2014 to play President Barack Obama, darkening the comedian\u2019s skin for the role. Another sketch, which aired in 2013, featured Armisen and Nasim Pedrad speaking in stereotypically accented English while portraying Chinese laborers.\n\nBut as many SNL fans noted last week, those sketches made Season 45\u2032s original casting announcement all the more poignant. One of the comics hired alongside Gillis was Bowen Yang, a Chinese American comedian who writes for the show. Yang was widely celebrated as SNL\u2019s first cast member of East Asian descent, though many news stories noted the partial Asian heritage of both Armisen and Schneider, who is of Filipino descent.\n\nSNL\u2019s lack of Asian American representation on screen has long been an issue \u2014 even when it comes to the show\u2019s celebrity hosts. When Awkwafina hosted the show last October, she became only the second Asian American woman to host the show. (Her predecessor, Lucy Liu, hosted in 2000. Korean Canadian actress Sandra Oh, who hosted SNL in March, was among those who supported SNL\u2019s decision to fire Gillis. \u201cGlad 2 see @nbcsnl decision NOT legitimize/give platform 2 purveyors of racist homophobic content,\u201d the \u201cKilling Eve\u201d star tweeted.\n\nBurr referenced SNL\u2019s poor track record during his appearance on \u201cLights Out.\u201d \u201cIf you say something like that, you can\u2019t work in a sketch show, but, like, it\u2019s okay for what, he can work at a lumberyard? He\u2019s certainly going to meet more Asians there,\u201d he said to awkward laughter from the audience.\n\nBurr, who notably riffs on cancel culture in his latest Netflix special, \u201cPaper Tiger,\u201d offered a clarification: \u201cThan on SNL! It\u2019s a joke about how SNL\u2019s not hiring Asians.\"\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he added. \u201cNow I\u2019m in trouble?!\u201d", "description": "Former cast members such as Norm Macdonald and Rob Schneider and others like Bill Burr and Jim Jefferies aired their displeasure with the show's decision.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "September At Pm", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
