The educational campaign was rejected by the tech giant because it \u201chadn\u2019t been authorized to run ads about social issues, elections or politics,\u201d according to Vice.\n\nSince PrEP was introduced and approved by the FDA in 2012, its proven to be a success. New cases of the virus have dropped by 31 percent in New York City for all communities except Asians and Pacific Islanders. This is where the Apicha Community Health Center hoped to spark change through its paid advertisements on Instagram. However, speaking to Vice, Phillip Miner, Apicha\u2019s Director of Grants and Communications said: \u201cThey said the copy was the problem but were unable to tell us what part of the copy was too political.\u201d\n\nCredit: Apicha Community Health Center\n\nApicha\u2019s initial plans to promote education around PrEP on social media involved targeting API men in NYC and becoming more visible to folks that don\u2019t already follow them on Instagram. The campaign, which is visible on the healthcare\u2019s Instagram account, featured artwork and interviews by queer API artists, who discuss stigma, representation, and their personal experiences with taking the HIV preventative drug.\n\nThis kind of censorship that Apicha is facing is all too common for the likes of sex workers, NSFW artists, and sex toy companies wanting to promote their work online. Platforms such as Facebook and Instagram could be easy tools for organizations to use and reach their audiences, but with strict censorship \u2014 that\u2019s only getting even stricter \u2014 it\u2019s become just another hurdle that sex-positive and LGBT+ companies must work around.", "description": "Facebook and Instagram refused to run an educational campaign promoting the benefits of PrEP \u2014 a HIV preventative drug \u2014 claiming it was political.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FWhat-time-is-it_-1-2.png&signature=2cd59c57b5ea1ca1672c14283aeca076", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
