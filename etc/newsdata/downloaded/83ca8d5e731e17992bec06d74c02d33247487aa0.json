Namely, what about us?\n\nAT&T isn't commenting on the report, which The Wall Street Journal attributed to unnamed \u201cpeople familiar with the matter.\u201d According to the WSJ, AT&T could spin DirecTV off into its own separate public company or merge its assets with satellite TV rival Dish Networks.\n\nIf DirecTV were to actually hook up with Dish, it would elevate its rival to the No. 1 spot among satellite providers, with a combined subscriber base (including Dish-owned Sling TV) of about 30 million.\n\nThe odds of this union are no better than 50-50 with no guarantee the government will bless the marriage, says industry watcher Philip Swann, editor and publisher of TVAnswerman.com, who has followed DirecTV since its launch in 1994.\n\nBut let's play out the possibilities.\n\nCould subscribers see a price break?\n\nHowever this plays out, the reality is there's nothing static about the state of today\u2019s TV scene. Disney and Apple are poised to join a congested streaming and video-on-demand service market that includes Netflix, Hulu, CBS All Access and Amazon Prime.\n\nAT&T is getting in the game, too, through the HBO Max service coming in the spring from the company's WarnerMedia division.\n\nSuch competition could positively affect consumer pricing. Apple made a bold statement by announcing that it is giving away its upcoming Apple TV+ service for a year to customers who buy a new iPhone or other products.\n\nThe flipside of all these choices is that they may introduce a wave of confusion in terms of where to find what you want to watch.\n\nKobe's money moves: Ex-NBA superstar Kobe Bryant scores as an investor by preaching patience\n\nIf that turns out to be football, DirecTV still has a crown jewel in NFL Sunday Ticket.\n\nSuch expanded options may not hit every viewer equally.\n\n\u201cI think a Dish-DirecTV merger would reduce choice for rural residents, particularly those who don\u2019t have access to high-speed internet service,\u201d Swann says. \u201cThey now depend on DirecTV or Dish for basic and/or premium TV service.\u201d\n\nWhy would they break up in the first place?\n\nThe landscape for TV viewing has changed quite a bit since AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 in a deal valued at $67 billion. A wave of streaming services and cord-cutting caused some static, even when giving customers unprecedented viewing options.\n\nDirecTV has lost about 2 million customers during that span, and \u201cthe continued subscriber losses, coupled with outside calls for change, \u201cwill force AT&T to take some action,\u201d Swann says.\n\nThough cord-cutting is most definitely a factor, Swann also points to complaints surrounding the company\u2019s customer service and price hikes. AT&T barely made a dent with its DirecTV Now live TV service for phones, which was renamed AT&T TV Now in July.\n\nIn a pending class-action complaint, it's alleged that AT&T pushed sales reps to create fake DirecTV Now accounts to juice subscriber numbers, which AT&T vigorously denies.\n\n\"We plan to fight these baseless claims in court,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nThough The Wall Street Journal's story didn\u2019t rule out DirecTV staying put \u2013 sources told CNBC that AT&T isn't focused on getting rid of it \u2013 the possibility of a split certainly looms, especially while AT&T is under pressure from activist investors that want the company to focus on its core business and the rollout of next-generation 5G wireless networks.\n\nHow will the plot turn? As they\u2019ve been saying in TV land for years, stay tuned.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Is AT&T selling DirecTV?
