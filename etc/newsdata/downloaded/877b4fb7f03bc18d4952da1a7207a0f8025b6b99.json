(Patricia Sullivan/The Washington Post)\n\nThe close ties between Florida and the Bahamas \u2014 history, economy, family and geography \u2014 mean that the catastrophe Hurricane Dorian brought to the islands is felt keenly across the water.\n\nBahamian expatriates who live in South Florida said Tuesday that they\u2019re shocked by the damage and worried about relatives they haven\u2019t heard from. Some say they feel heartsick about what Dorian did to the Bahamas \u2014 and guilty that it has had a lesser impact on Florida.\n\nThey have resolved to help rebuild the battered archipelago.\n\n\u201cFor the most part, folks here are a little relieved, but there\u2019s a lot of hurricane guilt,\u201d said Marlon Hill, a Miami lawyer and community activist focused on the South Florida Caribbean diaspora. \u201cThat damage we see in the Bahamas could have been here or any one of the counties up the east coast.\u201d\n\nFood drives and other recovery efforts started in Florida before Dorian left the Bahamas on Tuesday afternoon, after pummeling the islands with relentless wind and rain for more than 24 hours as a Category 5 storm, the most powerful ever in that region.\n\n\u201cThe Bahamas and Florida, we are connected at the hips,\u201d said Jaffus Hardrick, president of Florida Memorial College in Miami, where 12 percent of the students are from the Bahamas. \u201cSouth Florida is what it is because of the impact of the Bahamians many years ago. We\u2019re in this together. When they hurt, we hurt.\u201d\n\nHe said several students hadn\u2019t been able to locate family members back home as of Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing everything in our power to assist these students,\u201d Hardrick said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have counselors and support to help them deal with the emotional challenges of not being in touch with family members.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 20,000 Bahamians live in South Florida. The island chain is close to the state; only 52 miles of ocean separates Bimini, the westernmost island, from Miami. Freeport, on Grand Bahama Island, is 143 miles directly east of West Palm Beach.\n\nFor a while, the storm was predicted to travel east from Grand Bahama and make landfall in Palm Beach County. Residents up and down the east coast of Florida were told to watch and prepare for the worst, but the storm had largely stayed offshore as of Tuesday evening.\n\nIn the Bahamas, though, the devastation was unimaginable, and worries about landfall on the mainland turned quickly to fears about family members in the islands. Frantic scenes from cellphone videos taken in the Bahamas and posted on social media alarmed relatives stateside.\n\nShanda Roberts received videos from her relatives, who evacuated their homes in the Arden Forest neighborhood in Freeport.\n\n\u201cWhen they left, the water was up to their ankles,\u201d said Roberts, who lives in Cutler Bay, Fla., about 20 miles south of Miami. \u201cThen it started coming up to their chest. They were almost drowning when a man in a tractor came by and saved them.\u201d\n\nHer aunt, Rosalie Robinson, sent a video of another bulldozer plowing through deep water, with the driver honking the horn and calling for people to come out of their houses.\n\nRoberts posted it on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been crying since yesterday. I think I\u2019m physically sick from all this,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine the terror and horror of people who were in it.\u201d\n\nHer aunt took shelter in the Church of the Ascension, a hurricane shelter in Freeport. She said some people who didn\u2019t evacuate when the order was given Saturday afternoon were forced out of their homes when the rains and storm surge poured in quickly.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrifying situation,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe started with 33 persons in this shelter. It grew to 363. Some of them came in with only their shoes on their feet and the clothes on their backs.\u201d\n\nAfter more than 48 hours crammed in the shelter, hearing the roaring winds of Dorian outside, Robinson said, four pastors in the church decided to hold a liturgical service Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe prayed, we sang songs together, we found encouragement,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a good night\u2019s rest. The only noise was the sound of the winds blowing on the roof. It sounded like a freight train. But everybody was very peaceful.\u201d\n\nRobinson said Bahamians now need the basics: food, clothing and shelter. \u201cAnd we would find some comfort if the world would pray for us,\u201d she added.\n\nAt the Koinonia Worship Center in Broward County, volunteers lined up Tuesday to unload donations \u2014 flats of water, medical supplies, boxes of cereal and sanitary supplies \u2014 from a steady stream of vehicles.\n\nAmong the volunteers eager to unload the donations was Robert Stephens, 27, who heard Tuesday morning that his 89-year-old great-aunt and her son in Nassau, the nation\u2019s capital, had escaped their severely damaged home and made it to a shelter. A friend of his also evacuated into a Bahamian shelter.\n\n\u201cHe is terrified to go back to his home. He doesn\u2019t know what happened to it, if it\u2019s even standing,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nAnother congregant of the church, Latisha Dean, 35, said she heard through a chain of Facebook messages that her uncle and his family in the Abaco Islands were able to escape their home and go to a nearby church on higher ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking not to know where your family members are, if they are alive,\u201d she said by phone from her workplace. \u201cBut thank God they are. Pray for the whole island.\u201d\n\nHer father and sister, in Nassau, also survived and had enough power left in their cellphone batteries to call Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt could very well be us experiencing what the Bahamas are experiencing now,\u201d Dean said. \u201cPeople at work want to help. I told them we will really need supplies, and we need to rebuild.\u201d\n\nEver since the Rev. Eric Jones and his son, state Rep. Shevrin Jones (D), put out a call on social media for people to donate supplies for hurricane relief in the Bahamas, volunteers and donors have flooded into the Koinonia Worship Center.\n\nVice Mayor Brian C. Johnson said that outside of a large community of expatriate Bahamians in Miami, West Park in Broward has the largest per capita population of Bahamians in the United States.\n\n\u201cThere will be an enduring sense of loss\u201d after the storm passes, he said. \u201cI serve in a community where the culture, the flag, the memories of the islands are readily evident every day. The Bahamas are just that close to us.\u201d\n\nRoberts said the closeness between the two countries will be important in rebuilding the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Bahamians,\u201d Roberts said, \u201cthey look out for each other.\u201d", "description": "Ties between the state and the island nation are close.", "authors": ["Lori Rozsa", "Patricia Sullivan", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Other Regional Issues In Arlington County", "September At Pm", "Lori Rozsa Is A Freelance Reporter", "Frequent Contributor To The Washington Post.
