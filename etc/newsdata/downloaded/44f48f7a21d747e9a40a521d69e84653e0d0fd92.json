The U.S., as part of its trade war against China, claims Huawei has installed such backdoors and warned allies not to use its equipment. But so far only America's own Apple has been found out.\n\nAsked about the memo on Monday, the Defense Ministry said, \"Rather than referring to specific Chinese-made equipment, we were simply voicing general concerns over IoT and 5G network equipment made in China.\"\n\nIn other words, it claims not to have had Huawei specifically in mind. But the military apparently uses Huawei as well as other Chinese-made communication equipment on dozens of bases, although officials deny this.\n\nThe ministry also issued a warning to troops of suspicions that North Korea was behind 45 percent of hacking attempts targeting it.", "description": "Military Lied About Vulnerable Huawei Equipment", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
