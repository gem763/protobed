The privately held company runs 50 chunky, workhorse vessels known as car carriers specially built for the transport and has contracts to move Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV autos, along with Ford Motor Co. , Volvo AB and General Motors Co. brands.\n\nAuto makers globally produced some 95 million new cars and commercial vehicles last year, according to industry data provider Statista, and a substantial number of those move in international trade on large cargo ships designed to carry vehicles. The European Union is the leading exporter, with 6.1 million cars worth $154 billion shipped overseas last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n\nThe U.S. is the main buyer of European cars such as Mercedes, BMW and Volkswagen, bringing in 1.2 million cars, followed by China\u2019s import of 600,000 European vehicles.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cWe put them on ships that load 8,000 cars on a dozen decks, packed like Penn Station at rush hour,\u201d said Yiannis Sgouras, a veteran captain. \u201cThey come from Germany, Italy and the U.K. to Texas, Georgia and New York. Drivers take them out and bring in Jeeps and Fords for the trip back to Europe.\u201d\n\nThe business is flagging, however, amid slowing growth in developed markets and trade tensions that threaten to raise the cost of vehicles and dampen consumer sales.\n\nGlobal car production fell 1% last year from 2017, the first annual decline since the 2009 financial crisis, according to Statista.\n\n\u201cThere will be no growth in our trade over the next months,\u201d Mr. Grimaldi said. \u201cSeaborne trade is falling and it has to do with this new protectionism in America. Tariffs hurt trade.\u201d\n\n\u201c Seaborne trade is falling and it has to do with this new protectionism in America. \u201d \u2014Emanuele Grimaldi\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently lowered its forecast for world trade volume growth this year to just 1.1%, less than half the growth estimate of 2.5% in July. Any significant retreat in automotive shipping is likely to lead to retrenchment in the car-carrier trade.\n\nMr. Grimaldi said 10 of the ships his company operates are chartered and he will return some to the owners if demand weakens. He said he fears the tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods that the U.S. imposed on Friday could trigger another escalating trade row.\n\n\u201cU.S. tariffs with Europe will be a big challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cWith China there is a chronic trade imbalance. It\u2019s not the same with Europe, but I fear the trade tension may escalate.\u201d\n\nTrade disputes are mostly affecting car-carrier long-haul transports from China, Japan and South Korea to the U.S. and Europe.\n\nU.S. automotive sales have slipped this year, albeit from very high levels, and declined 12% in September from a year earlier, according to industry analysis firm Edmunds. The U.S. Commerce Department said a 0.9% drop in sales at car dealerships and auto parts stores was a significant factor in declining U.S retail sales last month.\n\nMr. Grimaldi said Americans and Europeans are keeping their cars longer, waiting on a new generation of hybrid and electric vehicles to come to the market.\n\n\u201cThere are expectations of big advances in terms of batteries. The diesel car market is becoming smaller and people are waiting for new hybrids and electric cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThat market will eventually take off.\u201d\n\nCar makers like Volkswagen AG are investing heavily in joint ventures with battery makers in a push to create more electric cars. The German giant said in July it will invest $56 billion in battery cells.\n\nMr. Grimaldi said sales of certain U.S. brands like Jeep are growing fast in Europe and Asia.\n\n\u201cThey are iconic American cars that are very popular across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFiat has done a good job showcasing them at all dealerships across its network.\u201d\n\nJeep global sales were up more than 12% last year, one of the fastest growing performers in the auto industry.\n\nU.S. new car exports reached 1.8 million units in 2018, the lowest in four years, according to the U.S. International Trade Administration. The main export markets were Canada, China, Germany, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, according to industry data\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. imported 8 million vehicles last year, about the same as 2017. The imports came mainly from Mexico, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the U.K. and Italy.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "Italy\u2019s Grimaldi Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest ocean-going car carriers and heavy equipment movers, expects stagnant demand over the next year as recession fears and trade disputes tamp down vehicle sales growth around the world.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com", "Emanuele Grimaldi"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118353/social", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
