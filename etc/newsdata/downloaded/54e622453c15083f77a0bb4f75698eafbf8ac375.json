Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been rising in the polls and why Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is a shadow of his 2016 self, you could use the Democratic convention in New Hampshire as a microcosm.\n\nSanders got a big welcome from fans not only in one section of the Southern New Hampshire University Arena but throughout the hall. Warren got by far the biggest, most raucous and enthusiastic welcome, her supporters decked out in mint-green T-shirts and pounding on noise-maker sticks. Sanders went through his litany of promises \u2014 single-payer health care, forgiveness of all student debt, and more. Warren told how she\u2019d pay for (albeit with a wealth tax many economists doubt would raise enough funds) an agenda built around her central theme and presented in the context of her own biography.\n\n\u201cWe have a country that is working great for the wealthy and leaving everybody else behind,\u201d Warren said. \"We have a country where our economy, our democracy, our government are working for those with money and not so much for anyone else.\u201d\n\n\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

(Scott Eisen/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cSo I grew up out in Oklahoma in a paycheck-to-paycheck family,\u201d Warren continued. \u201cI\u2019ve had the same dream since I was in second grade. I wanted to be a public school teacher. There it is. My path was a little bumpy, my family didn\u2019t have any money, I dropped out of school at 19 and got married.\u201d Right there, she had a good chunk of the electorate who could relate. And she pointed out how she made her way: \u201cMy big chance was what was then a commuter college that was about 45 minutes away and cost $50 a semester.\u201d She added, \u201cI held on for dear life. I\u2019ve lived my dream job, I\u2019ve been a special needs teacher.\u201d\n\nNot only does her life story ground her in a reality with which most voters can identify, but it explains why, unlike Sanders\u2019s platform, her agenda is not scattershot, spraying goodies for all whatever the cost. She told the audience:\n\nAnd what can we do with two cents [her 2 percent wealth tax]? We can do universal child care for every baby in this country age zero to five \u2013 two cents! Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in this country \u2013 two cents! Raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in this country \u2013 two cents! We can do all of that, and we can make technical school, community college, and four-year college free for everyone who wants an education \u2013 two cents! . . . We can put $50 billion into our Historically Black Colleges and Universities \u2013 two cents. And just one more I\u2019ll mention. We can do all of that and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who got it \u2013 two cents. Two cents.\n\nWhether you think her plan adds up or not, she seems to channel the ghost of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the friend of the little guy who is going to save capitalism from itself.\n\n\u201cI get it that in America, there are gonna be people who are richer and people who are not so rich. And the rich are gonna own more shoes, and they\u2019re gonna own more cars, and they may even own more houses,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they shouldn\u2019t own more of our democracy.\u201d\n\nShe is out to solve a problem of inequality, to help real people in their lives. She\u2019s not there to promote a revolution for the sake of revolution.\n\nWarren\u2019s tone and Sanders\u2019s are radically different, even if ideologically they may come out in much the same place. Sanders has one volume \u2014 loud \u2014 and one mood \u2014 angry. Warren certainly can rouse the crowd, telling people, \u201cThis is our moment to dream big and fight hard!\u201d But she also tells a story and has a conversation with her audience.\n\nAnother contrast was on display: Sanders called out President Trump as racist, xenophobic, homophobic and bigoted against other religions He\u2019s a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d Sanders said. Warren didn\u2019t mention Trump\u2019s name.\n\nPerhaps in a preview of the debate this Thursday, Warren cautioned the crowd, \u201cThere is a lot at stake, and people are scared. But we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\" Continuing her not-very-subtle jab at former vice president Joe Biden, she told the crowd: \u201cWe can\u2019t ask other people to vote for someone we don\u2019t believe in. We win when we call out what is broken, when we show how to fix it, and when we build a grass-roots movement to get it done.\u201d\n\nThese days, Warren has a better electability argument than she did eight or nine months ago. Clearly, she has energized the base in a way Biden has not. She\u2019s not a self-identified socialist, but she is a fighter for the constituency Trump betrayed with plutocratic, incoherent policies. And finally, she\u2019s now beating Trump in some head-to-head polls.\n\nThe secret to her success (aside from more than the 50,000 selfies she mentioned having taken with voters on the trail) may be that, as Trump sinks in the polls and gets crazier by the day, voters may figure out that \u201celectable\u201d includes most of the Democratic field. Warren says they can have excitement and electability. That\u2019s a compelling message among Democrats these days.\n\nRead more:\n\nJennifer Rubin: In New Hampshire, Trump drives turnout \u2014 for Democrats\n\nHelaine Olen: What Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have in common\n\nRob Stutzman: Why Elizabeth Warren is the one to watch\n\nKatrina vanden Heuvel: Bernie Sanders has a smart critique of corporate media bias\n\nJennifer Rubin: What do the Democratic candidates\u2019 typical voters look like?", "description": "Why Warren has an advantage over Sanders.", "authors": ["Jennifer Rubin", "Opinion Writer Covering Politics", "Policy", "Foreign", "Opinion Writer", "September At Pm", "Jennifer Rubin Writes Reported Opinion For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/78GCnKQXJXjttNBTAo2MntO1WiQ=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-08-2019/t_35d5338097994ef6b4ece618d737ee26_name_warren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
