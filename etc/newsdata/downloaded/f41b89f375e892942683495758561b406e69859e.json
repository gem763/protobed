In addition to towing submarines and barges in the loch, the tugboats were also sent out to rendezvous with submarines at sea. The tugboats engaged in naval exercises with the submarines and performed medical evacuations and intelligence missions.\n\nI recall the American, British and Soviet submarines playing dangerous cat and mouse games in the Irish Sea and the North Atlantic, and had the Cold War turned hot, as Trevor Royle states in his book \u201cFacing the Bear: Scotland and the Cold War,\u201d Scotland would have been a prime target for destruction by the Soviets.\n\nThe Cold War, which lasted roughly from the end of World War II in 1945 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, saw the US and NATO allies poised and ready for war with nuclear-armed missiles aimed at the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc nations.\n\n\u201cFor much of the period Scotland was on the front line, mainly due to its position on NATO\u2019s \u201cnorthern flank\u201d \u2014 the waters of the north-east Atlantic and the Norwegian and Barents Seas with the vital Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap through which Soviet nuclear-armed submarines and strategic bombers would have attacked in the event of an outbreak of hostilities,\u201d Trevor Royle writes. \u201cThat made Scotland the first major obstacle: it would have been in these northern seas and over Scottish skies that the first battles would have been fought. That accounted for the build-up of sophisticated antisubmarine warfare facilities and air defenses in Scotland and it was from the American and British bases on the Clyde that the strategic submarines would have launched the response by way of Polaris and Poseidon missiles, each of them capable of destroying Hiroshima several times over.\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Royle\u2019s history of the Cold War era in Scotland, he notes that not everyone was happy with the American Navy creating a nuclear submarine base at Holy Loch near the Clyde. The 1960 US-UK deal to allow the Polaris-equipped submarines to locate in Scotland became a focal point for anti-nuclear protests. Mr. Royle explains that the movement attracted pacifists, environmentalists, trade unionists and leftist politicians. Yet many Scots welcomed the Yanks and were thankful for the defense partnership, as well as the infusion of dollars into the local economy.\n\nAs Mr. Royle, a broadcaster and military historian, tells us, Scotland played a key role in NATO\u2019s forward maritime defense operations, which helped contain the threat from the Soviet Bear. During this period, 10 per cent of the British air and naval forces were based in Scotland, including a submarine base at Faslane. The American presence in Scotland, in addition to the Holy Loch submarine base, included top secret satellite stations. The British and American military bases not only provided for the defense of Scotland, the rest of the U.K. and the NATO partners, but the military also brought huge economic boosts to the region.\n\nAlthough there were events that nearly led to World War III during the Cold War, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the U.S.-USSR standoff during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD, kept the Cold War from turning hot. With MAD, even if the Soviets totally destroyed the U.S., the UK and other NATO partners in a surprise missile attack, the nuclear-armed aircraft in the air and the nuclear-armed submarines under the sea would launch a counterattack that would totally destroy the Soviet Union. The USSR was also equipped with this deterrent.\n\nAccording to Mr. Royle, the MAD strategy was based on the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d which had come into being during World War II and which was cemented in the late summer of 1958 by the signing of the Agreement for Co-operation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes. This agreement enabled both countries to exchange classified information with the objective of improving atomic weapon design, development, and fabrication capability.\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. military bases in Scotland helped keep the Soviet Bear in check during the Cold War.\n\nThe book also covers the Scottish regiments that served in the Korean War and in West Germany, as well the Scottish cultural aspects of the Cold War. The book even mentions briefly my old Navy tugboat, the USS Saugus, YTB-780.\n\n\u201cFacing the Bear\u201d is an interesting look back at the Cold War era in Scotland.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nFACING THE BEAR: SCOTLAND AND THE COLD WAR\n\nBy Trevor Royle\n\nCasemate, $40, 368 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
