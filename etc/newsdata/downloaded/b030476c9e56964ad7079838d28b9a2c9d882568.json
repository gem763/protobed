Irvin, his lawyer, said on Friday. \u201cThey would not let Mr. Jefferson participate in burial arrangements. That\u2019s why we had to seek an injunction.\u201d\n\nAtatiana Jefferson\u2019s Funeral Canceled Amid Family Feud\n\nThompson ruled that the father has the authority to make arrangements for his daughter\u2019s funeral, according to court records. On Monday, Dallas County probate court judge Brenda Hull Thompson heard from both sides of the Jefferson family in a closed-door meeting to determine whether the restraining order should continue.\n\nAt the end she announced the funeral is scheduled to take place on Thursday at 11 a.m. in Dallas\u2019 Concord Church, according to the Dallas Morning News. Hull said she issued a gag order to prevent members of the family, and their lawyers, from talking about what happened in the meeting.\n\nBoda has previously claimed Jefferson is not Atatiana\u2019s legal or biological father, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nThe dispute comes amid rising community tension against the Fort Worth Police Department and the District Attorney\u2019s office in a case that has prompted mass protests against racial bias and police use of excessive force.\n\nAuthorities said Dean, who has resigned from the force and been charged with murder, responded to an Oct. 12 welfare check call at Jefferson\u2019s home after one of her neighbors noticed her front door was slightly ajar.\n\nHer 8-year-old nephew told police that while the two were playing video games in the bedroom, Jefferson heard someone outside and got a gun out of her purse. She pointed it at the window, according to court documents, out of fear of an intruder.\n\nTexas Police Officer Fatally Shoots Black Woman Inside Her Own Home During Welfare Check\n\nBody-cam footage shows Dean and another officer walking alongside Jefferson\u2019s home with flashlights before entering her backyard gate\u2014all without identifying themselves.\n\nAfter seeing \u201ca person standing inside the residence near a window,\u201d police previously said, Dean shouted at Jefferson to put her hands up before opening fire within seconds. It is not clear if Dean saw the weapon.\n\n\u201cI get it. We are trying to do better... anyone who had looked at that video saw it was wrong,\u201d Police Chief Ed Kraus told reporters the day Dean was charged.\n\nThe shooting occurred less than two weeks after former police officer Amber Guyger in nearby Dallas was convicted of fatally shooting her unarmed black neighbor, Botham Jean, inside his apartment in 2018.\n\nHundreds have since gathered to protest the incident\u2014including a small group that came together on Saturday to commemorate Jefferson and the 60th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s visit to Fort Worth. Rev. Al Sharpton told those protestors via audio message \u201cthe battle is in; the fighters are coming. We want the nation to know what\u2019s going on in Fort Worth.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
