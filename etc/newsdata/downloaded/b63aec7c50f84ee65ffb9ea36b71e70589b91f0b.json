The numbers are the highest in the annual survey since 1983.\n\nThe results -- compiled in 2018 -- are based on the responses of about 1,400 adults, aged 19-to-22, including 900 full-time college students and about 500 part-time.\n\nThough, the researchers only had comparable data on college students going back to 1980. So it\u2019s hard to tell how common pot use was in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nForty-three percent of students in the study said they\u2019ve used some form of marijuana at least once in the past year. That\u2019s up 38 percent from the previous year's Michigan survey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome 25 percent said they\u2019ve used pot in the previous month, up from 21 percent. And about 6 percent said they used pot 20 or more times in the past month.\n\nCompared to adults of the same age who weren't enrolled in college, that number was 11 percent.\n\nThe survey also found another 11 percent of college students who said they\u2019ve \"vaped\" marijuana in the previous month. That\u2019s more than double the figure in the 2017 survey.\n\nThe uptick in pot use has John Schulenberg, one of the Michigan researchers, concerned: \u201cIt's the frequent use we're most worried about,\u201d he said, adding that he believes it could be linked to poor academic performance and have negative impacts on mental health.\n\nResearch varies widely on that claim.\n\nMarijuana use has been rising among college students for more than a decade. Schulenberg said it seems to be tied to views about risk: In the early 1990s, about three-quarters of young adults said pot was risky. In 2018, that number was down to 22 percent. Plus, in the last few years, marijuana has been legalized in 33 states for medicinal use and 11 states and Washington, D.C. for recreational use.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA Pew Research Center poll found that 62 percent of Americans, supported legalizing marijuana.", "description": "The numbers are the highest in the annual survey since 1983.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
