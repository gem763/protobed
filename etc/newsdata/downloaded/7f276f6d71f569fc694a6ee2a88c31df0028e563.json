Then one process being competitive and with improved creativity.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived here, the creativity is more or less good, but being competitive was worse. It was not enough.\n\n\u201cI think last year I started to improve being competitive, also more or less creativity with some very good matches playing with that creativity.\n\n\u201cThe supporters, there are a lot of supporters with different opinions. Some want more creativity, some want maybe more intensity, more energy. I want both and my way is both, both sometimes one player is less with than that another because this is the way.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cLast year we did not achieve, we were in the table by one point and in the Europa League final and we lost in the end. And okay, we were there. And this year - be there and take it.\u201d\n\nEmery urged his critics to give him time as he looks to blood youngsters such as Joe Willock, Bukayo Sako and Gabriel Martinelli into the team.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are playing for our supporters and my message is that we are going to carry on with patience, and tomorrow they will feel this team is playing as we want and also transmitting energy and playing good.\n\n\u201cMy idea is being competitive, creativity and getting here. We are in one process with some young players - patience!\u201d", "description": "Boss says Gunners had lost their competitive edge towards the end of his predecessor's reign and insists he is building for the future", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20710153.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Europa-League-Arsenal-Training.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
