There is no way we can lower our guard,' King said on Wednesday.\n\n'We face a challenge from those who have been prosecuted and locked up in prison for terrorist offences over recent years coming to the end of their term and being released.\n\n'There are some thousands of such individuals in our prisons across Europe.'\n\nIn addition, around 500 European fighters were detained in Syria after ISIS lost its last patch of territory earlier this year, he said.\n\nHe added that up to 1,400 children with at least one EU parent were also in Syria, of whom half are in prison.\n\nTurkey this month launched a military offensive on Syria's Kurdish-controlled north-east region, where most ISIS militants are locked up.\n\nSome of the militants are currently being repatriated by EU states, but legal challenges have for long delayed operations.\n\n'Obviously the events in Syria at the moment do not make that any easier,' King said.\n\nLocked up: The fate of ISIS prisoners in Syria - some of whom are seen in a cell last week - is also a concern for European security forces\n\nThe fate of captured ISIS fighters has been highly controversial in Europe since the terror group's supposed 'caliphate' crumbled to nothing earlier this year.\n\nSecurity experts have warned it may be difficult to prove criminal charges against hundreds of fighters, meaning dozens or even hundreds of ISIS supporters would walk free in Europe.\n\nLast month the European Union set up a common counter-terrorism register in the hope of making convictions easier.\n\nThe new tool could also help prevent new attacks in Europe, as prosecutors will have access to more information on suspects, officials hope.\n\nFrench jihadists made up the largest contingent of European ISIS recruits, it is believed.\n\nAn ISIS cell of French and Belgian fighters previously crossed from Syria into Turkey and launched deadly attacks on Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.\n\nDonald Trump has threatened to 'drop' jihadist fighters at the UK border if Britain does not take back its imprisoned terrorists.\n\nThe President called his European allies a 'tremendous disappointment' in a furious attack just moments after he announced the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. would not pay for hundreds of jihadists to be held at Guantanamo Bay 'for the next 50 years,' Trump warned.", "description": "Julian King (pictured in Brussels) said there were more than 1,000 people being held on terror charges and said that others imprisoned for unrelated crimes may also have been radicalised.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20382062-0-image-a-50_1572449464717.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
