(AP) \u2014 Anthony Davis hopes to return to the Los Angeles Lakers' lineup for their next preseason game after confirming his thumb injury isn't serious.\n\nDavis went through a full practice with the Lakers on Tuesday.\n\nThe Lakers' superstar newcomer jammed his thumb while playing in an exhibition game in China last week. An MRI determined the injury was only a sprain, which is what Davis suspected all along.\n\nHe sat out of Monday's game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors, but he hopes to play in the rematch on Wednesday night.\n\nCoach Frank Vogel says the team hasn't decided whether Davis will play Wednesday.\n\nKyle Kuzma also has been cleared for noncontact practice activity in his return from a foot injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
