For this, 20 job candidates from varied socioeconomic backgrounds were recruited to interview for an entry-level lab manager position at Yale.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nBefore the interview, candidates recorded a conversation where they were asked to describe themselves.\n\nA sample of 274 individuals with hiring experience listened the the audio or read the transcripts and were asked to then assess the candidate's professional qualities and perceived social class, without looking at their CVs.\n\nThose who listened to recordings were found to be more likely to accurately assess a candidate's socioeconomic status than those who read transcripts.\n\nWith no information about the candidate's social classes, the hiring managers judged the candidates they perceived to be from a higher class more competent for the job than those from lower social classes.\n\nKraus added: \"We rarely talk explicitly about social class, and yet, people with hiring experience infer competence and fitness based on socioeconomic position estimated from a few seconds of an applicant's speech.\n\n\"If we want to move to a more equitable society, then we must contend with these ingrained psychological processes that drive our early impressions of others.\n\n\"Despite what these hiring tendencies may suggest, talent is not found solely among those born to rich or well-educated families. Policies that actively recruit candidates from all levels of status in society are best positioned to match opportunities to the people best suited for them.\"", "description": "A new study has found that the first seven words you say in a job interview reveal more about you than you might realise", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20076828.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Female-work-candidate-applying-for-job-in-office.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
