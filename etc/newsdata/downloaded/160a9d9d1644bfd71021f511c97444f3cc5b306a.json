Today, the company announced the Analogue Pocket, which is essentially the most advanced Game Boy ever made. The gorgeous device has the form factor of the original Game Boy and can play cartridges from the GB, GBC, and GBA \u2014 that\u2019s more than 2,700 games \u2014 with a display that has 10 times the resolution of Nintendo\u2019s classic device, according to Analogue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wanted to do a tribute to portable gaming since the beginning,\u201d Analogue\u2019s Christopher Taber tells The Verge.\n\nThe Pocket features a 3.5-inch, 665ppi, LCD display, with a 1600 x 1440 resolution and built-in backlight. It\u2019s powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, charged via USB-C, and also includes an SD card slot, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and remappable buttons. There\u2019s even a built-in synthesizer called Nanoloop, which should come in handy given the Game Boy\u2019s history in the chiptune scene.\n\n\u201cPocket is a tribute to all of portable gaming.\u201d\n\nSupport for the device will also extend beyond Nintendo\u2019s line of handhelds. Analogue says that it\u2019s creating adapters so the device can also play titles from the Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, and more. (There\u2019s no word yet on how much the adapters will cost.) \u201cPocket is a tribute to all of portable gaming,\u201d Taber says. \u201cOur goal is to bring support to all handheld game systems to Pocket. The adapters will be rolling out with launch, some coming later and plans to continue to develop and release more system supports.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more surprising, Analogue is also making a dock that connects directly to an HDTV, so you can play the original Link\u2019s Awakening on a big screen. The dock will be sold separately (again, no word on pricing), and it will support both Bluetooth controllers and wired USB ones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with suppliers for years to try and find the perfect display.\u201d\n\nOf course, this is far from the first release from Analogue, which has designed modern takes on consoles like the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis. But Taber says the company had always wanted to tackle a portable device, despite it being a much more complicated machine to design and produce.\n\n\u201cHandheld game systems are another category of video game history that are riddled with issues,\u201d he explains. \u201cExtremely low quality displays, no backlights, limited to one platform, etc. Pocket solves all these issues elegantly. Really it came down to the display. We\u2019ve been working with suppliers for years to try and find the perfect display \u2014 one with the right aspect ratio, resolution, pixel density, color accuracy, pixel refresh, and brightness. We finally were able to get the display of our dreams for retro aspect ratios.\u201d\n\nBetween the Analogue Pocket and the similarly gorgeous Playdate, 2020 is shaping up to be something of a banner year for retro handhelds. Analogue\u2019s portable device will be launching at some point next year for $199.", "description": "Analogue is known for its high-end retro consoles, and now, the company has turned its attention to the Game Boy with the Analogue Pocket, a sleek handheld that plays classic cartridges.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4567I0QPnZGe0Ki6wWSwj7OOfss=/0x477:2000x1524/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19273061/2_Analogue_Pocket.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
