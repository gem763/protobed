(532977.BY) reported a 21% increase in second-quarter net profit from a year earlier, partly due to lower tax expenses, despite a drop in sales.\n\nNet profit for the July-September quarter was 15.23 billion Indian rupees ($215.1 million), compared with INR12.57 billion a year ago, the Indian automaker said Wednesday.\n\nThat beat the mean estimate of INR11.85 billion by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nRevenue fell 4.1% to INR77.07 billion, the company said. Domestic motorcycle sales for the quarter fell particularly sharply, dropping 25% from a year earlier, Bajaj Auto said.\n\nWrite to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 04:37 ET (08:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
