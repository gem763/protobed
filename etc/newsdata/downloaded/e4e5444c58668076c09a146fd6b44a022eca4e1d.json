The 'Sustainable City' is a sustainable development a mere 12.5 miles (20 kilometres) from Dubai. Spanning 0.18 square miles (0.46 square kilometres), the private settlement contains 500 villas and 89 apartments. These are accompanied by office, retail and civic facilities. The development is solar powered \u2014 with a peak energy production of 10MW \u2014 and employs water recycling. Aside from peripheral roads and parking facilities, the settlement is a car-free site. Residents walk, bike or use electric carts to get around.\n\n'The Sustainable City is a living laboratory for testing future technologies and solutions,' said Karim El-Jisr, head of the SEE Institute, the research arm of the city's developer, Diamond Developers.\n\nWhen the project started six years ago, building a zero-energy development 'seemed a bit like a dream', he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n'Today it is not difficult anymore, tomorrow everybody will have to do it,' he added.\n\nThe Sustainable City is one of several developments launched across the region in recent years that are aiming to serve as a model for environmentally-friendly living in the Middle East.\n\nHouses, offices and other buildings are responsible for around 40 per cent of the world's climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, the think tank World Resources Institute (WRI) has reported.\n\nThis issue is heightened in the UAE which \u2014 according to the World Bank \u2014 has one of the highest per capita carbon footprints in the world, said WRI urban efficiency and climate programme director Emma Stewart.\n\nAround 75 per cent of all electricity produced in the UAE is sucked up by buildings \u2014mainly to power air-conditioning systems \u2014 she added.\n\n'They have an immense need for cooling to keep the population within their comfort range,' Dr Stewart told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nFenced off by a wall of trees, the so-called 'Sustainable City' is a green oasis a mere 12.5 miles (20 kilometres) from the high rises at the heart of the capital city\n\nThe Sustainable City has, for the largest part, outlawed cars.\n\nInstead, residents zip through the development's streets on bicycles, or small electric carts \u2014 all under the shade of the palm trees that flank the strips of square, white houses.\n\nBuildings and car parks are topped with solar panels that feed into the grid, meaning that residents only pay the difference between what they produce and consume.\n\nResidential units are designed to avoid direct exposure to the sun and are covered in paint that reflects sunlight away, while wastewater is recycled to irrigate green areas, Mr El-Jisr said during a visit to the site.\n\nResident Belinda Boisson, 46, \u2014 and immigrant from South Africa \u2014 said that she did pay more rent than the Dubai average.\n\nHowever, she added, alongside sustainability, the city also offered a family-friendly environment and sense of community that was rare to find among Dubai's high rises.\n\n'[Children] can play outside, without me worrying about my daughter being hit by a car,' Boisson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nFenced off by a wall of trees, the so-called 'Sustainable City' is a green oasis a mere 12.5 miles (20 kilometres) from the high rises at the heart of the capital city of Dubai\n\nAccording to Diamond Developers, the Dubai settlement is the first in the region \u2014 which is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat, droughts and rising sea levels \u2014 to become fully operational.\n\nIn neighbouring Abu Dhabi, the state-sponsored development of Masdar City had previously been touted as the world's first emissions-free city, one designed to house up to 50,000 residents.\n\nAfter breaking ground in 2008, however, the settlement remains behind schedule and sparsely populated.\n\nIn Qatar, the Msheireb area of Doha is also undergoing a carbon-cutting makeover.\n\nDevelopers of the 76-acre regeneration zone \u2014 which aims to become 'one of the largest sustainable cities in the world' \u2014 are outfitting it with green features, including rainwater harvesters and overhangs to create shady areas to walk around.\n\nA similar development is also being planned in Muscat, Oman \u2014 while Diamond Developers is establishing a second 'sustainable city', in the emirate of Sharjah, which will be around twice the size of its predecessor.\n\nOpened to its first residents in 2016 and to be completed next year, the Sustainable City is a private settlement built to use as little energy and water as possible\n\nAccording to Mr El-Jisr, the second sustainable city is being built with the lessons learnt from constructing the first \u2014 where not everything went according to plan \u2014being held firmly in mind.\n\nFor example, he noted, a 'grey-water' system set up to recycle water from showers and washing machines into the city's artificial lake was ultimately decommissioned.\n\nDevelopers had discovered that phosphates from the soapy waters were fuelling 'unsightly' blooms of algae.\n\nThis waste water is now re-purposed for irrigation, but the city still relies heavily on Dubai's energy-intensive desalination plants, Mr El-Jisr added.\n\nFurthermore, the settlement still consumes more energy than it produces, he said.\n\nIn a bid to reduce power consumption, new motion-activated lighting is being installed across the development, and new ideas to improve efficiency are being sought, Mr El-Jisr said.\n\n'It is not enough to design, build and then walk away,' he added.\n\n'You always have to make adjustments.'\n\nThe development contains 500 low-lying villas \u2014 home to nearly 3,000 people \u2014 as well as commercial spaces and a mosque\n\nLow-carbon projects like Dubai's Sustainable City are useful testing grounds for cities looking to go green, argues Abdulla Al Basti, the head of Dubai's executive council.\n\nHowever, such developments are no magic bullet against global warming, cautioned University of Portsmouth architecture expert Alessandro Melis.\n\n'They are good experiments that can tell us many things,' Professor Melis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n'But at this moment in time it would be more important to focus on how we can transform the urban fabric that we already have.'\n\nDr Stewart agreed, noting that building new developments \u2014 no matter how sustainable they might be \u2014 can end up less efficient than retrofitting existing ones.\n\nOn average, construction accounts for around 10 per cent of all emissions generated across a building's lifespan, she said.\n\nBy showing what is possible, however, new developments could inspire policymakers to take bolder action, she added.\n\nIf a group of desert emirates can find a way to go green, such could provide a powerful example to other cities, Dr Stewart noted\n\nIn September, the UAE pledged that by 2030 all new buildings will produce no more emissions than they absorb, with existing buildings to meet this standard by 2050 \u2014 a promise that Professor Melis calls ambitious, but technically feasible.\n\nIf a group of desert emirates can find a way to go green, such could provide a powerful example to other cities, Dr Stewart noted.\n\n'If this can be done in a desert environment that is difficult for humans to inhabit [...] it can be done everywhere,' she concluded.\n\nThe Sustainable City has, for the largest part, outlawed cars.
