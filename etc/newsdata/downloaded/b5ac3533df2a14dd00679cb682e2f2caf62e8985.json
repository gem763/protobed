It\u2019s clear that even if we only had to think about SpaceX\u2019s constellation, the issue would need to be addressed.\u201d\n\nFor Le Gall, Musk\u2019s company \u201cisn\u2019t doing anything against the rules. The problem is that there are no rules. There are air traffic controllers for planes. We will end up with something similar.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Thousands of pieces of junk \u2013\n\nJan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency, admits: \u201cThe best situation would be to have international law\u2026 but if you ask for that, it will take decades.\u201d\n\nSo far, only France has stipulated in its own laws that any satellite in low orbit must be removed from orbit in 25 years.\n\nThe US space agency NASA and others have adopted rules for their own satellites, but without legal constraints.\n\nSo the space agencies and industry power players are hoping that everyone will voluntarily adopt rules of good behavior, defining things like the required space between satellites, coordination and data exchanges.\n\nVarious codes and standards were put down on paper from the 1990s, notably under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nOne of the most recent charters was created by the Space Safety Coalition \u2014 so far, 34 actors including Airbus, Intelsat and the OneWeb constellation project have signed on.\n\nThe problem with such charters is that one major new satellite constellation project that refuses to play along could make things difficult for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very classic problem with polluters,\u201d says Carissa Christensen, the CEO of Bryce Space and Technology, an analytics and engineering firm.\n\n\u201cThis is very typical of issues where there are long-term challenges, and costs and benefits.\u201d\n\nIn addition, national space agencies would like to clean up Earth\u2019s orbits, which are now strewn with junk from 60 years of space history.\n\nThree large US rocket stages mysteriously \u201cfragmented\u201d last year, says Bonnal \u2014 that created 1,800 pieces of debris.\n\nThe French expert says removing just a few large objects a year would help.\n\nOne example would be the stages of the Soviet-era Zenit rockets, which each weigh nine tons and are nine meters long. Every month, they pass within 200 meters of one another.\n\nIf two of them collide, it would double the number of objects in orbit.\n\nBut for now, no one knows how to remove these giant objects from space.\n\nIn the short term, a best practices manual may be the best solution.\n\nExperts also hope that SpaceX manages to maintain control of its satellites as Starlink takes shape.\n\nAlready, of the first 60 satellites launched, three of them \u2014 five percent \u2014 stopped responding after just a month in orbit.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The internet of space is here.
