My family home movies, for instance, have poor camerawork, they\u2019re grainy as all buggery and whoever they hired to play three-year-old me should be fired.\n\nHe was always looking at the camera, could barely remember his lines let alone string a sentence together, and his body language was just unnatural. What\u2019s the first rule of acting? Pretend like the camera\u2019s not there.\n\nThe Little Mermaid happens to be heads and shoulders above my home movies though, as it has truly held its own over the years.\n\nGenuinely, this movie has been around for three decades and it still gets more airtime than most blockbusters that came out four years ago.\n\nI did a shallow-dive into exactly why the \u201990s classic has achieved this rare level of success, and I dare you to rebut any of it.\n\nThe bangers\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a time since The Little Mermaid (except perhaps Aqua\u2019s debut album in 1997) when I heard so many consistent bangers in one body of work.\n\nIf you\u2019re rusty, here are some of the certified hits that came out of it:\n\nPart Of Your World\n\nUnder The Sea\n\nPoor Unfortunate Souls\n\nKiss The Girl\n\nWhen does a movie ever produce four songs that I still regularly hear either remixed, being hummed by a rando on the train or being covered by everyone from Ashley Tisdale to Homer Simpson?\n\nThe thottie prince\n\nSo as everyone\u2019s well aware, Disney is no stranger to churning out god-like specimens.\n\nIn fact, I can\u2019t recall a Disney movie where I didn\u2019t lust over at least one of the characters. But, Prince Eric is next-level, even by Disney standards.\n\nThe only downside is that he has set the standard so high, regular humans look like budget knockoffs.\n\nUrsula in general\n\nHands down the best villain to ever exist \u2013 Disney or otherwise.\n\nThat flippant statement is bound to ruffle some feathers but I have exactly three strong, powerful points that will ease the tension.\n\nOcto-gurl has pipes. Despite her despicable ways, I\u2019d sign up to work for her evil business in a heartbeat \u2013 which says a lot about her people skills. I\u2019ll forever be in debt to Ursula for teaching me the importance of ~body language~.\n\nCase. Closed.\n\nThe progressive relationship\n\nOkay, interspecies relationships in the real world tend to be frowned upon (illegal), but that\u2019s not the point of the movie \u2013 it was to give everyone hope.\n\nThe love between Ariel and Prince Eric is so unlikely, to this day I believe that anything\u2019s possible. Sure, a lot of humans are bargain knockoffs but, as The Little Mermaid taught me, there are plenty of fish in the sea.\n\nI just didn\u2019t realise it was supposed to be taken literally.", "description": "In news that's\u00a0not so great for those of us clinging on to our youth (me), it turns out that The Little Mermaid classic cracks the big 3-0 this year.", "authors": ["Louis Costello"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-5.05.08-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
