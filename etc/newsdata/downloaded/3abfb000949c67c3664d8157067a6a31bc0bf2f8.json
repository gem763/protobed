I was thinking about people talking to computers or computers talking to computers, not people talking to people.\u201d\n\nThe new Connection Lab will welcome research on topics including machine learning, social networking, blockchain and the internet of things, with an eye toward thwarting online evils.\n\nKleinrock expressed particular interest in using blockchain technology to attach reputations to people or things online to provide a gauge of who or what to trust.\n\nFor example, someone reading an online restaurant review would be able to see how reliable that author\u2019s posts have been.\n\n\u201cIt is a network of reputation that is constantly up to date,\u201d Kleinrock said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is how to do that in an ethical and responsible fashion; anonymity is a two-edged sword, of course.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Businesses being bad \u2013\n\nHe blamed many of the internet\u2019s ills on businesses hawking things that are outdated or unneeded, violating privacy to increase profit.\n\nInstead of clever lone hackers that vexed the internet in its early days, bad actors now include nation states, organized crime and powerful corporations \u201cdoing big, bad things,\u201d Kleinrock lamented.\n\n\u201cWe were not the social scientists that we should have been,\u201d Kleinrock said of the internet\u2019s early days.\n\nHe regretted a lack of foresight to build into the very foundation of the internet tools for better authenticating users and data files.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have avoided the dark side, but it would have ameliorated it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe remained optimistic about the internet\u2019s woes being solved with encryption, blockchain or other innovations.\n\n\u201cI do still worry. I think everyone is feeling the impact of this very dark side of the internet that has bubbled up,\u201d Kleinrock said.\n\n\u201cI still feel that the benefits are far more significant; I wouldn\u2019t turn off the internet if I could.\u201d\n\n\u2013 What kind of beast? \u2013\n\nIn the early days, US telecom colossus AT&T ran the lines connecting the computers for ARPANET, a project backed with money from a research arm of the US military.\n\nA key to getting computers to exchange data was breaking digitized information into packets fired between machines with no wasting of time, according to Kleinrock.\n\nA grad student began typing \u201cLOG\u201d to log into the distant computer, which crashed after getting the \u201cO.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the first message was \u2018Lo\u2019 as in \u2018Lo and behold,\u2019\u201d Kleinrock recounted. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have a better, more succinct first message.\u201d\n\nKleinrock\u2019s team logged in on the second try, sending digital data packets between computers on the ARPANET because funding came from the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) established in 1958.\n\nCredit for creating the internet is a topic of debate, since there are a series of key moments in its evolution including arrival of protocols for how data is routed, and creation of the World Wide Web system of online pages.\n\nThe name \u201cinternet\u201d is a shortening of the \u201cinternetworking\u201d allowed when one computer network could collaborate with another, according to Marc Weber, curatorial director at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cThe billion dollar question is, what kind of beast has the internet become?\u201d Weber asked.\n\n\u201cIt has become the default main way for humans to communicate, and that is not small.\u201d\n\nWhile marking its 50th anniversary, the internet as we know it is a \u201crowdy teenager\u201d in the eyes of Internet Society chief technology officer Olaf Kolkman.\n\n\u201cThe internet has done more good than harm,\u201d Kolkman said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge we have in front of us is that while we cope with big problems enabled by global connectivity that we don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bath water.\u201d", "description": "San Francisco (AFP) \u2013 On October 29, 1969, professor Leonard Kleinrock and a team at the University of California at Los Angeles got a computer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/2a116b_leonard-kleinrock-poses-interface-message-processor-imp-in-lab-internet-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
