The teams will now play a decisive Game 5 on Wednesday night in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter going with an unconventional approach to his pitcher usage through the NL wild-card game and the first three games of the NLDS, manager Davey Martinez went the traditional route in Game 4. He stuck with Scherzer through seven innings of one-run ball, even trusting his tiring ace to navigate a bases loaded, one-out jam in the seventh inning. Scherzer rewarded him by striking out Chris Taylor and getting Joc Pederson on an inning-ending ground out.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOverall, Scherzer allowed four hits and three walks while striking out seven. The outing came three days after Scherzer struck out the side in relief in Game 2. Former closer Sean Doolittle took over in the eighth inning and recorded four big outs for Washington, mowing down Max Muncy, Justin Turner, Cody Bellinger and Corey Seager. New closer Daniel Hudson took it from there.\n\nAt the plate, Washington\u2019s lineup measured Dodgers starter Rich Hill the first time through the order before breaking through on Anthony Rendon\u2019s sacrifice fly the second time around. Sensing there was more trouble to come, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts went to his bullpen in the third inning. It was against the Dodgers\u2019 middle relievers that Washington\u2019s bats really locked in.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nationals broke the tie and then broke the game open with a four-run fifth inning. Trea Turner, Anthony Rendon and Howie Kendrick each singled, which set the stage for Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s thunderous three-run home run against Pedro Baez. Washington added a single run in the sixth when Turner doubled and was driven in by Rendon.\n\nThe Nationals stay alive by beating the Dodgers in NLDS Game 4.

He\u2019s been there since the beginning, and it\u2019s only fitting that he delivered the biggest hit in franchise history.\n\n\u2022 Anthony Rendon: Washington\u2019s run-producing machine was exactly that. Rendon started the scoring for Washington with a third-inning sac fly against Rich Hill. In the fifth inning, he scored another run with a single against Julio Urias. Then, in the sixth inning, he added a second sac fly against Ross Stripling. Three key situations against three different pitchers. Three runs batted in.\n\n\u2022 Trea Turner: It was a productive game for several Nationals hitters. That included Turner, who finished with three hits and two runs scored. Turner is 6-of-16 overall in the series.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nHere\u2019s another angle of Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s clutch home run.\n\nThe ballpark was actually shaking before he hit it.\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nCan the Nationals finally win a playoff series? It\u2019s never happened before, and that includes the franchise\u2019s time as the Montreal Expos. Since moving to Washington, the Nationals have been one win away from advancing on three different occasions, but lost decisive Game 5\u2019s in 2012, 2016 and 2017. The 2016 loss came to the Dodgers.\n\nOn the other side, Dodgers fans must be wondering if this can possibly happen again. Another team that is primed and loaded to win the World Series is now one loss away from falling short of the ultimate goal. The possibility of not escaping the first round only adds to the angst.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThis series is headed to a do-or-die Game 5 on Wednesday in Los Angeles, and should feature a gem of a pitching matchup. We know the Dodgers will throw Game 1 winner Walker Buehler, who held Washington scoreless over six innings. It\u2019s expected Washington will counter with Stephen Strasburg, who won Game 2 behind six innings of one-run ball. First pitch is scheduled for 8:37 p.m. ET.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Nationals stay alive by beating the Dodgers 6-1 in NLDS Game 4.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TbIcR5yewhLQ2WE3qM0lrw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rksGDD9DyaBMX0IMmxkivw--~B/aD0zMjY1O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9729b1f0-e96d-11e9-9dff-69cad08bea6b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
