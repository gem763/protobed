Lee Merritt, an attorney representing both the Brown and Jean families, told DailyMail.com on Sunday that Brown's recent death was an 'assassination'.\n\nJoshua Brown, who testified in Dallas cop Amber Guyger's high-profile murder trial, was shot dead just days after his testimony helped convict her\n\n'I don't know whether his death or his murder was in connection with the trial of Amber Guyger or his testimony therein. I know that it was close enough in proximity to raise eyebrows and that it is worthy of thorough investigation,' he said.\n\nHe refused to rule out that police were somehow involved in the shooting that took Brown's life.\n\n'There is certainly a possibility. We just sat through a trial where law enforcement was actively covering up for a fellow law enforcement officer,' he said.\n\nS. Lee Merritt, an attorney representing both the Brown and Jean families, told DailyMail.com on Sunday that Brown's recent death was an 'assassination'\n\n'I don't put it past Dallas Police Department to be involved. I don't have any evidence that they are involved other than the proximity upon which the murder happened and the resolution, but again it is something that is worthy of a thorough investigation.\n\n'I don't have any evidence other than the timing, but I am not ruling anything out. But what I do know is that Joshua was targeted. This was an assassination. He pulled into his parking lot and he was shot. The perpetrators fled. They didn't steal anything from him.\n\n'This is a kid who had no gang ties, there was no lover's quarrel. He was an AirBnB host and roofer. All the usual suspects of crime, drugs and sex are simply not there.'\n\nLast year, Brown was shot in the foot and a 25-year-old man was killed in a shooting outside a nightclub.\n\nHis family attorney told CBS that after that shooting, Brown was concerned that someone was after him and was reluctant to testify in the Guyger case.\n\n'I don't think that he wanted to be there,' Merritt told DailyMail.com.\n\n'There was actually a strange moment in the trial when the judge told him the first time that he was introduced to the courtroom: 'You've already been sworn.' That means that somehow, prior to his testimony, she had already had dealings with him and had sworn him in to testify.\n\n'To me that indicates that he was there via subpoena, that he was there against his will and that he was concerned about the publicity associated with testifying in one of the highest profile trials of the year.'\n\nAmber Guyger (left) was found guilty last week and sentenced to 10 years in prison for the September 2018 murder of her upstairs neighbor Botham Jean (right)\n\nBrown lived in the same apartment complex as both Jean and Guyger but authorities said he was gunned down outside a different one\n\nDallas Police Chief Renee Hall said her department does not yet have any suspects in Brown's killing.\n\nDallas Mayor Eric Johnson said on Twitter on Sunday that he trusts the police will conduct a thorough investigation into the killing of Joshua Brown and that people should 'refrain from speculation' in the meantime.\n\nBrown was a key witness at Guyger's trial.\n\nHe testified that on the night of the killing, he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived, and that he heard what sounded like 'two people meeting by surprise' and then two gunshots.\n\nAt times during his testimony, Brown became emotional and used his T-shirt and tissue to wipe away tears.\n\nHe said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nBrown testified that he was from Jacksonville, Florida, and had moved to Texas in 2008 before he left to attend the University of South Florida, where he played football from 2012 to 2013.\n\nBrown was shot in the parking lot of the Atera apartment complex (above) in Dallas's upscale Medical District at about 10.30pm on Friday\n\nMerritt described Brown as 'a truly genuine soul that was loved deeply by his family and friends'.\n\n'I will work to get to the bottom of his murder,' he said.\n\nBrown was shot in the parking lot of the Atera apartment complex in Dallas's upscale Medical District at about 10.30pm on Friday.\n\nHe was rushed to nearby Parkland Memorial Hospital where he died from his injuries.\n\nWitnesses say they heard several gunshots and saw a silver sedan speeding out of the apartment complex's parking lot shortly after.\n\nMerritt said he was originally told Brown had been shot in the mouth and chest but said he is now waiting for confirmation of the bullet wounds from the Medical Examiner.\n\nHis Saturday tweet claiming Brown had been shot in the mouth led to dozens of online comments that he had been killed because he had given evidence against a police officer and that shooting him in the mouth was a message to others.", "description": "Joshua Brown, 28, was gunned down on Friday in Dallas just three days after his evidence helped convict Amber Guyger of the murder of her upstairs neighbor Botham Jean.", "authors": ["Emily Crane", "Martin Gould In Dallas", "Texas", "For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19409714-0-image-a-120_1570473982739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
