He later doused her body in WD-40 and set her on fire with a barbecue lighter (pictured Ms Maasarwe's father Saeed arriving at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Tuesday)\n\nMs Maasarwe had just stepped off the tram when she called her sister Ruba Maasarwe (Ms Maasarwe's other sister Noor Maasarwe pictured)\n\nMs Maasarwe had just stepped off the tram when she called her sister Ruba Maasarwe.\n\nRuba had only just picked up the phone when she heard a blood-curdling scream and her sister shouting 'You piece of s***',' in Arabic.\n\nThen the phone went silent as Herrmann carried out his sickening attack.\n\nAt Herrmann's pre-sentence plea hearing earlier this month, prosecutor Patrick Bourke claimed Herrmann had 'complete and utter disregard for the humanity of the victim'.\n\nEarlier this week, Aiia's father Saeed Maasarwe (pictured arriving at court) had earlier said he didn't care how long his daughter's killer was jailed for\n\n'It strikes at the liberty of all, but of course in particular women, to do no more than walk down a public street in peace and safety,' he said.\n\nHerrmann himself has been unable to explain why he murdered Ms Maasarwe, and a grovelling letter of apology to her parents failed to provide any answers.\n\n'I'm sorry, your daughter didn't deserve such a terrible and tragic thing to happen to her,' the killer's handwritten letter read.\n\n'I didn't expect any forgiveness as I will never be able to forgive yourself and I will be trying to make amends for the rest of my life.\n\n'Don't give into hate like I did': Herrmann's apology letter directed at Aiia's devastated parents\n\nAiia's father Saeed Maasarwe (right) said he didn't care how long his daughter's killer was jailed for\n\nHerrmann dragged Ms Maasarwe into bushes before raping her with such ferocity that she was left with horrendous injuries, including a broken bone in her neck from where he throttled her\n\n'There is no excuse. I truly apologise, I will pray for you and your family every day.\n\n'Don't give into hate like I did.'\n\nEarlier this week, Aiia's father Saeed Maasarwe said he didn't care how long his daughter's killer was jailed for.\n\n'All the time she smiled. I remember all the time she thinks positive. And she was very, very sensitive,' he said, according to The Guardian.\n\n'Our compass is not revenge.\n\n'We think all the time, our mind, our compass is positive, is not negative.'", "description": "Codey Herrmann, 21, bashed Ms Maasarwe over the head with a metal pole as she was walking home from the tram in Bundoora, Melbourne, on January 16.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Australia Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20302246-0-image-a-6_1572302136463.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
