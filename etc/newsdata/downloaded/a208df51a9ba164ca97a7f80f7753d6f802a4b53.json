REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nThe last time New Mexico supported a Republican in a presidential race was 2004. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton beat Trump there by 8 percentage points three years ago.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign sees an opening in the state with Latinos, who it believes will swing his way despite tough immigration policies, including a crackdown on migrants from Central America and a push to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nDemocrats have criticized those efforts. But a Trump campaign aide said the Republican president could win over Latinos who came to the United States legally and believe others should, too.\n\n\u201cBig crowd expected in New Mexico tonight, where we will WIN. Your Border Wall is getting stronger each and every day \u2014 see you in a few hours!\u201d Trump tweeted ahead of his trip.\n\nThe campaign also views Trump\u2019s support for the fossil fuel industry as a plus in the state, which is rich in oil and natural gas, said the campaign aide, who declined to be named. Trump is likely to discuss energy on Monday night.\n\nTrump won the White House in 2016 with electoral votes from traditional Republican-leaning states and some surprise Democratic-leaning ones.\n\nThe Trump campaign says it wants New Mexico\u2019s five electoral votes to augment the 306 electoral votes the president received in his first election, not create a separate path for victory. A candidate must get 270 electoral votes nationally to win.\n\nDemocrats, who did well in New Mexico during the 2018 mid-term elections, are skeptical.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, Democrats crushed Republicans in New Mexico because voters are fed up with President Trump\u2019s toxic healthcare agenda and broken promises,\u201d said David Bergstein, a communications director for the Democratic National Committee focused on battleground states.\n\n\u201cWe take nothing for granted, but this GOP strategy looks like they\u2019re concerned about a realistic pathway to 270 electoral votes,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump won electoral-vote-rich swing states such as Ohio and Florida in 2016, while also picking up Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania from Democrats.\n\nThe campaign says it is eyeing more pickups in 2020, including Colorado, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Nevada.", "description": "President Donald Trump will hold one of his signature rallies on Monday night in New Mexico, a longtime Democratic stronghold his campaign has added to the list of states it hopes to win in the November 2020 election.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430606596&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1QD", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
