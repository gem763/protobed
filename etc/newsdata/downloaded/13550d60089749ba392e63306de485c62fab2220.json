Pictured is a bombed church in Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka's National Security Council met on April 9, with the defense ministry secretary asking Jayawardena for a briefing on Zahran, to which he responded that he would send a note later, the report said.\n\n'If the matter was discussed, steps may have been taken to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks,' it said.\n\nZahran, leader of a local Muslim group, was among the suicide bombers who participated in the attacks on three churches and three hotels. Five of the six attacks took place in and around Colombo, the capital.\n\nA total of seven suicide bombers died in the attacks, while another blew himself up later, after his explosives failed in a fourth Colombo hotel.\n\nThe committee also said an open spat between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that led to a political crisis last year contributed to the security failures.\n\nJayawardena was also found to have asked higher-level officials to bring investigations into the ringleader of the attacks, Mohamed Zahran, under his sole review.

Pictured is a mass burial for victims of the Easter attack\n\nThe report said that Sirisena failed on 'numerous occasions to give leadership and also actively undermined government and systems including having ad hoc National Security Council meetings and leaving out key individuals from meetings.'\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe are from different parties and formed a cohabitation government in 2015. They fell out and their spat broke into the open in October 2018, when Sirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe as prime minister.\n\nA court decision that restored Wickremesinghe as prime minister ended a 52-day government standstill. But from that point on, Sirisena did not involve Wickremesinghe in Security Council meetings.\n\nThe report said that the State Intelligence Service did not report to the military on possible attacks until April 19. The next day, Jayawardena called the national police chief to say there was a high probability that an attack would occur on April 21.\n\nOn Easter morning, Jayawardena called the police chief again to say that 'something dangerous would happen on that day,' the report said. He also called the secretary to the defense ministry, Hemasiri Fernando.\n\nFernando was quoted in the report as saying that 'within a few minutes' of speaking to Jayawardena, 'I heard that there had been a bomb explosion at one of the hotels.'\n\nThe committee recommended reforms in the security and intelligence sectors, improved monitoring of financial transactions, and the monitoring and controlling of religious extremism.", "description": "Sri Lankan State Intelligence Service chief Nilantha Jayawardena was given information on possible attacks 17 days before they happened, but didn't tell anyone until two days before.", "authors": ["Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20171542-0-image-a-2_1571993201979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
