No, not WeWork Cos Inc.; I\u2019m talking about Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA.\n\nOn Thursday the hip transatlantic airline, loved by bargain-hunting American millennials, announced the first fruits of its turnaround under a new chief executive officer. Geir Karlsen replaced the company\u2019s co-founder Bjorn Kjos as CEO this summer, and Norwegian\u2019s chairman Bjorn Kise stood down in May.\n\nAs well as reporting surprisingly good earnings for the third quarter, Norwegian announced a long-awaited aircraft-buying venture with a leasing subsidiary of China Construction Bank Corporation. The deal should help Norwegian keep more of its own cash, which is handy given the airline\u2019s massive spending commitments and other liabilities. Including lease obligations, Norwegian has $6.8 billion of net debt. The shares surged as much as 23% on the news, bruising the many hedge funds shorting Norwegian\u2019s stock.\n\nAs with WeWork, Norwegian\u2019s once giddy valuation imploded last year when investors started to doubt that the balance sheet was robust enough to support Kjos\u2019s huge ambitions. Not content with revolutionizing transatlantic air travel, he started domestic flights in Argentina too.\n\nThe stock has lost more than three-quarters of its value since April 2018, and a capital increase in January did little to stop the rot: Credit card companies became anxious about Norwegian\u2019s prospects and held back money it was due on ticket sales. Shareholders wanted evidence that Norwegian recognized the gravity of its situation and was responding. At last that appears to be happening.\n\nRecently the company secured a two-year extension on about $380 million of debt that was about to mature. Norwegian has also reined in costs and sold aircraft. Meanwhile, capacity growth is expected to be flat this year and may decline by as much as 10% next year. That sounds like heresy for a growth company but it\u2019s the right answer in such desperate circumstances.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Norwegian\u2019s in the clear. The June to September quarter is always good for airlines, while the winter months are much tougher because there are fewer passengers and there\u2019s less cash coming in. Boeing Co.\u2019s inability to restart deliveries of the 737 Max passenger jet creates additional costs for Norwegian, which is a big buyer of the aircraft, and it\u2019s still not clear when these issues will be resolved.\n\nFor now, though, Norwegian is proof that losing a charismatic founder needn\u2019t destroy a company\u2019s fortunes. Indeed, it might be just the ticket.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nChris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.
