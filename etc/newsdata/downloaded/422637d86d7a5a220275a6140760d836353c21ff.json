That was an unfortunate choice of words. It is an unfair process, and a better way to characterize it would be to call it an unfair process, and inconsistent with the kinds of procedural safeguards that are routinely provided for people in this kind of situation, either in court or in an impeachment process in our country.\u201d\n\n(h/t Grabien)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "During a press conference on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reacted to President Trump's tweet comparing the impeachment | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/GettyImages-1058617352.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
