I was too old. Too set in my ways. Too absent \u2014 always off on tour. Too keen on porcelain and photographs and modern art, none of which responds well to being knocked over or drawn on with crayon or smeared with Marmite.\n\nBut, really, my own childhood was at the root of every objection.\n\nBringing up children was an incredible challenge, and I knew from personal experience how awful it was if you f***ed that challenge up. I couldn't live with the thought of making my own children as miserable as I'd been.\n\nThen everything changed. It started with a visit to a Ukrainian orphanage: I felt an immediate connection to a little boy called Lev. David and I tried without success to adopt both him and his brother \u2014 but my paternal feelings didn't fade. I now wanted kids as much as David did.\n\nZachary was born on Christmas Day 2010; his brother Elijah on January 11, 2013. We used the same surrogate and egg donor for both.\n\nSo happy: Elton and David on their wedding day\n\nIf you'd tried telling the Elton John of the Seventies or Eighties that he could find more fulfilment on a deep and profound level in changing a nappy than in writing a song or playing a gig, you'd probably have had to exit the room at high speed immediately afterwards, with crockery flying past your ears.\n\nBut I loved everything about being a dad. I even found the toddler tantrums weirdly charming. 'You think you're being difficult, my little sausage? Have I ever told you about the time I drank eight vodka martinis, took all my clothes off in front of a film crew and then broke my manager's nose?'\n\nThe only person who didn't seem delighted for us was my mother.\n\nSince our civil partnership ceremony, something about her had definitely changed, or at least been amplified. She seemed to go out of her way to tell me how much she hated whatever I was doing.\n\nIf I made a new album, it was a load of rubbish: why didn't I try to be more like Robbie Williams? If I bought a new painting, it was bleedin' ugly and she could have painted something better herself. If I played a charity gig, it was the most boring thing she'd ever sat through, the evening only saved from complete disaster by someone else's performance, which had stolen the show.\n\nSir Elton and his mother Sheila in 2003\n\nFor variety, she threw in occasional thunderclaps of real anger. I never knew when they were coming or what was going to provoke them. Spending time with her was like inviting an unexploded bomb to lunch or on holiday: I was always on edge, just like I had been when I was a kid. The result was exactly what you'd expect: I started actively avoiding her. By the time Zachary was born, we weren't speaking at all. A tabloid journalist \u2014 looking for a scoop about the callously abandoned grandmother \u2014 asked her how she felt about not seeing her first grandchild. She told him she wasn't bothered and that she'd never liked children.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325\n\nIt was hurtful, but I couldn't stop laughing when I read that: no points for winning yourself sympathy, Mum, but ten out of ten for honesty.\n\nThe final row was over my PA, Bob Halley. We'd been together since the Seventies, but the relationship had become strained.\n\nBob enjoyed a very lavish lifestyle by proxy, and didn't like it at all when my new management team tried to make my tours more cost-efficient. The flashpoint was an argument over which car service we should use.\n\nThe management had brought in a more competitive company. Bob had got rid of them and employed a more expensive one. The management office overruled him, and Bob was furious.\n\nWe had a big argument about it. He said he'd been undermined; I said we were just trying to save money. He told me he was quitting his job, and I lost my temper and said that was fine with me.\n\nDon't go breaking my heart: Elton and his mother, Sheila\n\nLater, after I'd calmed down, I went back to speak to him again. This time, he told me that he hated everyone on my management team. I didn't really know what to say to that: your entire team or your PA? It's not exactly the toughest choice in the world.\n\nBob stormed out, adding, as he left, that my career would be over in six months without him. Whatever skills Bob had, clairvoyance clearly wasn't among them. The only change in my career after he quit was that the bills for touring expenses got noticeably smaller.\n\nMum was absolutely livid when she heard Bob had left \u2014 they'd always got on well. She didn't want to hear my version of events, and told me that Bob had been more of a son to her than I'd ever been.\n\nAnd that's when she said it: 'You care more about that f***ing thing you married than your own mother.'\n\nWe didn't speak again for seven years after that phone call. There comes a point when you realise you're just banging your head against a brick wall: no matter how many times you do it, you're never going to break through, you're just going to end up with a constant headache.\n\nI still made sure she was looked after financially. When she said she wanted to move to Worthing, I bought her a new house. I paid for everything; made sure she had the best care when she needed a hip operation. She auctioned every gift I'd ever given her \u2014 everything from jewellery to platinum discs I'd had specially inscribed with her name \u2014 though she didn't need money. She told the papers she was downsizing, but it was just another way of telling me to f*** off \u2014 like hiring an Elton John tribute act for her 90th birthday party.\n\nTension: Sheila with Elton as a toddler\n\nI ended up buying back some of the jewellery myself, stuff that had sentimental value to me, even if it no longer had for Mum.\n\nIt was sad, but I didn't want her in my life any more. I didn't invite her to the ceremony when the law on gay partnerships changed again, and David and I got married in 2014.\n\nBut I got back in touch when I found out she was seriously ill, and sent her some photos of the kids. 'You've got your hands full,' was the only mention of them in her reply.\n\nI invited her to lunch. She walked into Woodside and the first thing she said was: 'I'd forgotten how small this place is.'\n\nI was determined not to rise to the bait. Instead, I asked if she wanted to see the kids, who were playing upstairs. She said no.\n\nI told her that I didn't want to talk about Bob Halley, that I just wanted to tell her, after all we'd been through, that I loved her.\n\n'I love you, too,' she said. 'But I don't like you at all.'\n\nAfter that, we'd talk on the phone occasionally. I never asked what she thought of anything I'd done, and, if I mentioned the kids, she always changed the subject.\n\nI managed to get her and Auntie Win talking again, so that was something. No luck building bridges between her and Uncle Reg, though. I can't even remember what that argument had been about, but they still weren't talking when she died in December 2017.\n\nI was incredibly upset by Mum's death. I'd gone down to Worthing to see her the week before \u2014 I knew she was terminally ill, but she hadn't seemed at death's door that afternoon.\n\nShe never was one of life's tactile, nurturing mothers, and there was a mean streak to her that went beyond just being prone to bad moods, something I didn't like to think about too deeply because it frightened me.\n\nAnd yet there'd been times when she was supportive, times at the start of my career when she was really good fun: at first, my success seemed to change her, make her happier than she'd been when I was a kid.\n\nThat's how people who knew her in the early Seventies remembered her after she died: 'Oh, your mum was such a laugh.' We held a private funeral in the chapel at Woodside: I wanted to remember the good things, with just relations around me. I talked about her at the service and I cried.\n\nI missed the person I was describing terribly, but I'd started missing her decades before she died; she just seemed to vanish as quickly and unexpectedly as she'd turned up.\n\nAt the end, her coffin was taken away in a hearse. We all stood there, watching it go down the long drive, in silence.\n\nIt was broken by my Uncle Reg, addressing his sister for the last time. 'You can't answer anyone back now, can you, Sheila?' he muttered.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325. \u00a9 Elton John 2019.\n\nTo order a copy for \u00a312.50 (50 per cent discount) call 01603 648155 or go to mailshop.co.uk\n\nFREE delivery on all orders.
