She argued that Wong\u2019s name \u2013 and the name of fellow contestant Cheryl Hole \u2013 was \u2018horrible\u2019.\n\nCheryl Holes name was also called horrible by the former newsreader Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018[On] any other show, people would be screaming about demeaning women and racism,\u2019 she said in a now-deleted tweet. \u2018But because it\u2019s drag [thumbs-up emoji].\u2019\n\nIndia \u2013 who previously claimed to have a phobia of drag queens \u2013 had a stern reply, however, from one of the drag queens that she had so publicly bashed, who hit back at her remarks, saying that \u2018drag is about bending the realms and parodying reality.\u2019\n\nMy name is a pun on Cheryl Cole- someone who inspired a hell of a lot of my childhood, my creativity and my work. Would you prefer it was Cheryl Mole, Pole, Troll, Soul, Bowl, LOL. Drag is about bending the realms & parodying reality\u2026 But sure India \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb \u2014 Cheryl Hole (@CherylHoleQueen) October 4, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of the critiques, the story behind the name Sum Ting Wong is a genuinely lovely tale in using your hobbies to deflect and re-shape traumatic experiences from your past.\n\n\u2018When I started doing drag five years ago, I wanted a name that was cheeky but also reflected my British Vietnamese heritage,\u2019 the performer said. \u2018So I browsed the internet and came across a meme about an American news report which turned out to be a prank.\n\n\u2018It was about a missing Asian plane and all the names of the missing crew were plays on Chinese names, such as Sum Ting Wong and Wi Tu Lo, and another was Ho Lee Fuk. It was wrong in so many ways, and that was why I chose my name, as my own act of reclamation.\u2019\n\nThe first episode of RuPauls Drag Race UK was all kinds of iconic (Picture: BBC)\n\nIf you missed Drag Race UK\u2019s effervescent launch on the iPlayer last night, what were you doing instead?\n\nSome truly iconic television was made \u2013 from Andrew Garfield\u2019s bizarre stint as a judge to Alan Carr bringing down the house with his Regent\u2019s Park Zoo joke, which will now go down in history.\n\nNo matter what, though, we can safely say Willoughby wouldn\u2019t be up for a stint on the judging panel for the next series.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK episode 1 is now available to stream on BBC iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
