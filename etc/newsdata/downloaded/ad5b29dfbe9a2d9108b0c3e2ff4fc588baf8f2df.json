Thousands of tonnes of single-use plastic is still being produced as we speak and it is this very thing that clogs our drains, chokes our oceans and also becomes a cause of floods.\n\nPeople have come up with innovative ways to recycle plastic and Ashwani is another person on that list. Almost half a decade ago, Ashwani established the organisation called \u2018BasicShit' with the aim 'to solve sanitation problems by creating innovative public urinals across cities and implemented projects for cleaning and greening urban areas through research-driven innovative solutions\u2019, according to Efforts For Good.\n\nEfforts For Good\n\nBasicShit has come up with the ingenious idea of creating eco-friendly \u2019PeePee\u2019 public toilets, which are made out of single-use plastic! Yes, the very plastic you and I throw in the garbage.\n\nAccording to Efforts for Good, each PeePee toilet uses about 9,000 single-use plastic bottles, and these toilets do not require water to clean and do not smell either.\n\nDon't Miss 150 SHARES 747 SHARES 10.4 K SHARES 481 SHARES 363 SHARES\n\n\u2018Ashwani, the founder of BasicShit came up with this idea after studying various aspects of public urination around the country. He has authored several research papers and case studies on how public urination affects public health in urban areas\u2019.\n\nAshwini put in his own money to research and experiment with different kinds of urinal designs, across the country. He received some help with the grant from Asian Development Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne can actually support his initiative, after all, not only does it recycle single-use plastic, it also aims at taking care of open defecation in the country.\n\nTo put things in perspective, according to the data from Swachh Survekshan 2019, Delhi has 3,000 public toilets for men. If that number seems small to you, the number of toilets for women will come as a bigger shock. They are 30 in number.\n\nPeople like Ashwini are the ones who are creatively tackling the use of single-use plastic and we should support their cause.", "description": "Even though a war has been declared against single use plastic in India, the ban will only be gradual.
