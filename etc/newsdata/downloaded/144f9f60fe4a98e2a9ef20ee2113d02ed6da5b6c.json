They have been shut for eight working days out of safety concerns. Bankers and analysts also cited wide fears depositors will try to take out their savings when banks reopen.\n\nSchools and many businesses have also shut their doors. Protesters have blocked roads across the country for days.\n\nPeople from all sects and walks of life have flooded the streets for 11 days, furious at a sectarian ruling elite they accuse of plundering state resources for personal gain.\n\nAlkis Konstantinidis / Reuters Demonstrators form a human chain during ongoing anti-government protests in Beirut, Lebanon, October 27, 2019.

Efforts by the army to persuade protesters to unblock the roads have failed.\n\nAmid a sea of Lebanese flags and music blaring from loudspeakers, people joined hands along coastal roads on Sunday, aiming to span 171 kilometres from the south to the north.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is proof of how peacefully we are protesting, when you see people all holding hands and having one heart,\u201d said Nadine Labaki, an Oscar-nominated Lebanese filmmaker taking part in the chain in Beirut. \u201cToday is a fateful day.\u201d\n\nAt the Vatican, Pope Francis offered his prayers on Sunday for young protesters in Lebanon and asked for the international community\u2019s support to keep the country a place of \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d.\n\nThe size and geographic reach of the protests have been extraordinary in a country where political movements have long been divided along sectarian lines and struggle to draw nationwide appeal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to show the whole world that we are united,\u201d said Rasha Hijazi, joining hands with others in the southern city of Sidon. \u201cEveryone is coming to stay united against the corruption we are living with in this country.\u201d\n\nAlkis Konstantinidis / Reuters Demonstrators form a human chain during ongoing anti-government protests in Beirut, Lebanon, October 27, 2019.

A second said \u201cthere are no new developments regarding the deadlock\u201d.\n\nLebanon\u2019s government is grappling with one of the world\u2019s heaviest public debt burdens at 150% of GDP. It has declared an economic emergency to try to get its finances under control.\n\nRatings agency S&P on Thursday placed Lebanon\u2019s country ratings on \u201ccreditwatch negative\u201d on concerns about declining currency inflows.\n\nIt said deposit outflows totalled $2.1 billion for the first eight months of the year. The central bank\u2019s usable foreign exchange reserves are estimated to stand at $19 billion at the end of 2019, it said.\n\nLebanese authorities\u2019 inability to meet people\u2019s urgent demands could \u201cfurther test depositor confidence,\u201d it added.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Police remove an anti-government protester blocking a main highway with his body in Beirut, Lebanon, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019.

It has also yet to convince foreign donors to unlock billions in badly needed aid which they pledged last year.\n\nLebanon\u2019s Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai said the government could not ignore the people\u2019s \u201ccry\u201d for a small, politically neutral cabinet and should comply with their demands before it is too late, the National News Agency reported.\n\nHe also urged protesters to allow freedom of movement and not to act \u201cas if you are masters of the roads\u201d.\n\n(Reporting by Ellen Francis and Lisa Barrington, Tom Perry, Issam Abdallah, Alaa Kanaan, and Reuters TV; Writing by Ellen Francis; Editing by Tom Perry/Deepa Babington/David Evans)", "description": "Demonstrators are furious at a sectarian ruling elite they accuse of plundering state resources for personal gain.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db5bd0c210000602b34b2b5.jpeg?cache=qbhojuv7lg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
