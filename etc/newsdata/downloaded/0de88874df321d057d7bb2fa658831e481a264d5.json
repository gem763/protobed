An international team of researchers studied how people type using their touchscreens and real keyboards. They found that the gap between typing in the two ways is decreasing. The fastest texters tended to be those who used two thumbs and had auto-correction turned on. The team found that over 74 per cent of people use two thumbs to type, while only 14 per cent text without any form of automatic assistance.\n\nComputer scientist Anna Feit of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and colleagues used TypingMaster.com's typing speed test service to collect data on around 37,000 volunteers who used either mobile devices or a physical keyboard.\n\nThe participants consented to let the researchers record the keystrokes they made while transcribing given sentences, allowing the team to assess each persons typing speed, level of mistakes and other characteristics.\n\nAlthough the majority of the volunteers were reported to be women in their early twenties and predominantly US-based, the researchers managed to collect data on typists from more than 160 countries and of all ages.\n\n'We were amazed to see that users typing with two thumbs achieved 38 words per minute on average, which is only about 25% slower than the typing speeds we observed in a similar large-scale study of physical keyboards,' said Dr Feit.\n\n'While one can type much faster on a physical keyboard \u2014 up to 100 wpm \u2014 the proportion of people who actually reach that is decreasing.'\n\n'Most people achieve between 35-65 WPM.'\n\nThe researchers noted that the so-called 'typing gap' \u2014 the difference in speed achieved between using a keyboard or a touchscreen interface \u2014 is closing.\n\nThis is because people are increasingly becoming less skilled on physical keyboards, while methods for intelligent typing assistance \u2014 like auto-correction \u2014 continue to get more efficient.\n\nThe researchers believe that the gap may close, or even reverse, in the future.\n\nThe fastest display of texting recorded in the study was a user who could tap out an exceptional 85 words per minute.\n\nOn average, the participants in the study reported spending an average of six hours each day on their mobile devices.\n\n'Such large amount of experience transfers to the development of typing skill and explains why young people, who spend more time with social media, communicating with each other, are picking up higher speeds,' said Dr Feit.\n\nThe team also found that enabling the automatic correction of misspelt words improved on-screen typing speed, while devices that offered word prediction or selections to manually choose from did not have the same effect.\n\n'The given understanding is that techniques like word completion help people,' said paper author and computer scientist Sunjun Kim of Finland's Aalto University.\n\n'But what we found out is that the time spent thinking about the word suggestions often outweighs the time it would take you to type the letters, making you slower overall.'\n\nMost of the study participants were found to use some form of intelligent typing support \u2014 with only 14 per cent of users typing without any form of auto-correction, word suggestion or gesture-based typing.\n\nResearchers used an internet-based typing test to study how fast thousands of volunteers could transcribe sentences on both screens and keyboards\n\nThe study revealed a strong generational effect in typing on touchscreens \u2014 with those aged between 10 and 19 typically being able to type at around 10 words per minute faster than those in their forties.\n\n'We are seeing a young generation that has always used touchscreen devices, and the difference to older generations that may have used devices longer, but different types, is staggering,' said paper author Antti Oulasvirta of Aalto University.\n\n'This is a type of motor skill that people learn on their own with no formal training, which is very unlike typing on physical keyboards.'\n\n'It is an intriguing question what could be achieved with a careful training program for touchscreens.'\n\nHowever, the researchers found that formal training in ten-finger touch typing on physical keyboards appeared to confer no speed benefit.\n\nThe full findings of the study will be presented at the 21st International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, which is being held in Taipei, Taiwan, from October 1\u20134, 2019.", "description": "Researchers led from ETH Zurich used TypingMaster.com's typing speed test service to collect data on around 37,000 volunteers who used either mobile devices or a physical keyboard.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/16/19162528-0-image-a-66_1569943974260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
