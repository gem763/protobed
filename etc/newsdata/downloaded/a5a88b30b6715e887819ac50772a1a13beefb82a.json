This includes the bank's former executives and their associates, shareholder executives, politicians and their relatives and auditors who signed off on the bank's \"fraudulent\" financials.\n\nAccording to EWN, Rooplal said Shivambu would have to pay nearly R1.8m as part of the court order. Shivambu was reportedly in arrears for more than R2.7m. About R1m of this had already been paid since the court case started.\n\nIn terms of the judgment, which News24 has seen, Brian has to pay R 1 785 708.60 plus interest at the rate of prime plus 500 basis points calculated daily and compounded monthly from January 24, 2019, to date. He will also have to pay costs on an attorney and client scale.\n\nThe judgment is dated August 5.\n\nShivambu reportedly stood surety for the loan to Sgameka by VBS that was signed in December 2017. Sgameka had reportedly undertaken to repay it in 23 instalments of R190 637.24 and a final instalment of R188 555.37.\n\nRooplal reportedly said that Sgameka breached the loan agreement when it failed to make the monthly payments.\n\n- Compiled by Riaan Grobler\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android or iPhone.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has ordered Brian Shivambu, the brother of the EFF's Floyd Shivambu, to pay R1.78m to VBS Mutual Bank's liquidators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9298/fcf786d1e6c042859a8c98e06e103405.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
