My shortcomings in the college-admissions process haunt me, and I feel like the consequences of my failure will reverberate throughout the rest of my career. I constantly feel deficient in merit.\n\nI know that there are far worse things in this life than having failed to get into your dream college. I have never gone hungry. I grew up with two loving parents in a supportive environment with plenty of opportunities. We had more than enough money. In the end, I think it\u2019s the fact that I grew up with so much privilege that makes me all the more angry at myself for having not gotten into a better school and thereby having not earned a better job. The runway was always clear, but I botched the takeoff. As you referenced in your article, so many folks do not have the game rigged in their favor like I did.\n\nI know that reality often falls short of expectations, but nonetheless I have continually struggled to shake off the disappointment of a future lost. I am not asking for your pity, because, as you rightly point out, the rich of this country do not deserve any tears. I just want you to know that I am miserable too.\n\nConnor Holbert\n\nChicago, Ill.\n\nDaniel Markovits does an excellent job of describing the effects of \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in our society, yet misses the single most important root cause.\n\nNearly a century ago, hourly workers won a universal 40-hour workweek. Salaried workers are, however, free to be exploited. Over the past three or four decades, we\u2019ve watched worker productivity grow, along with salaried employees\u2019 number of work hours, which in some cases completely subsume their lives. Getting ahead in the salary pool of a large employer means out-working your colleagues, which invariably involves trying to put in more hours.\n\nEmployers have reduced their employment costs by encouraging (directly or indirectly) their workers to do more than one person\u2019s worth of work. Employees aren\u2019t a bottomless source of corporate wealth, however. Efficiency falls after a certain number of work hours in a day. Decisions may not be as sharp; flaws can creep in. And companies can lose institutional knowledge when workers leave.\n\nI submit that limiting the hours for all workers would do more to achieve the democratization of not only the workplace, but universities as well. Capping \u201cworker productivity\u201d in this way would force firms to hire more staff in order to fully exploit their markets. More jobs equals more opportunity, and the rest will sort itself out.\n\nPerhaps we have to eliminate \u201csalary\u201d as an employment concept in the U.S. entirely and translate all wages into hourly pay, and mandate overtime for exceeding the 40-hour workweek, the only exceptions being for those in the C-suite and board members.", "description": "Readers respond to our September 2019 cover story and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/09/1119_convo/facebook.jpg?1569419100", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
