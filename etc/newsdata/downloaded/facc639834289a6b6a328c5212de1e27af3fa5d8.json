Find out in our free guide!\n\nIn 2018, we saw 190 companies become listed on U.S. exchanges, and 2019 is proving to be no different. This year has been a hectic one for IPOs, with companies such as Uber (NYSE: UBER), Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND), and Slack (NYSE: WORK) going public so far. The year is far from over though, with many companies potentially going public in the next four months.\n\nWall Street subway stop More\n\nImage source: Unsplash.\n\nThese three companies plan on going public soon and should definitely be watched by investors.\n\n1. Airbnb\n\nAirbnb has taken the hotel and hospitality industry by storm. Launched over 10 years ago, it now hosts over 2 million people a night, for a total of 400 million people since the company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is available in 191 countries, 100,000 cities, and offers roughly 6 million different places to stay. Thanks to its cheap and easy-to-use service, Airbnb has become a household name.\n\nIn 2018, Airbnb saw a 62.5% increase in guest arrivals, with Mexico City and Beijing up 79% and 91%, respectively. Even though Airbnb is a privately traded company, reports have shown that in 2018's third quarter, Airbnb turned over $1 billion in revenue, with some analysts expecting revenue to hit $8.5 billion by 2021. A portion of this growth comes from Airbnb's more recent venture, Airbnb Experiences. Launched over three years ago, this service offers over 5,000 experiences in 60 cities across the globe, growing 2,500% in 2018. Unlike many companies that have gone public recently, Airbnb has also reported a positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the past two years. This has been aided by the experiences segment, with some experiences earning more than $200,000 each.\n\nThe growth of Airbnb has not gone unnoticed by traditional competitors such as Booking.com (NASDAQ: BKNG) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP), which now face a significant threat. A recent survey from Morgan Stanley indicated that 42% of Airbnb users had replaced a traditional hotel service with Airbnb's digital service. This is no surprise, with hotels costing 6% to 17% more than an Airbnb.\n\nWhile Airbnb has not yet announced when it intends to go public, an IPO is certainly on the table for the end of 2019. In a statement, co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk said: \"We have already said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in 2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019.\"\n\n2. Instacart\n\nApoorva Mehta, CEO of the popular grocery delivery company Instacart, said at the start of this year that \"an IPO is definitely on the horizon.\" Founded by a former Amazon employee, Instacart reached an $8 billion valuation in 2018 after raising $271 million in funding last November.\n\nWhile online grocery shopping makes up only 10% of consumer spending, the industry has seen significant growth in recent times. From 2016 to 2018, the online grocery market doubled, and it is expected that between 2018 and 2023, the market will quadruple, with 1 in 5 Americans predicted to buy groceries online.\n\nAlthough Instacart's revenue and profitability are not publicly disclosed, the company appears to be growing. Founded in 2012, Instacart now serves over 15,000 grocery stores in 4,000 cities and has formed partnerships with companies such as Kroger, ALDI, Sam's Club, and Walmart Canada. As of 2018, Instacart had over 30,000 customers and has been investing heavily in research and development, announcing the opening of a second R&D headquarters in Toronto, Canada.", "description": "There have been many high-profile IPOs this year, but here are three more to watch out for that might happen before 2019 ends.", "authors": ["Mywallst Staff", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9FPLJIw4QbCgOAQ40Axu4A--~B/aD0zMzI7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/a9ce786c9b84e5fa5dcfd7f7252cd5af"}
