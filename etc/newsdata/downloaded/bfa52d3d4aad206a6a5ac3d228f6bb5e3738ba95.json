A Labour government will be on your side, while Boris Johnson's Conservatives \u2014 who think they're born to rule \u2014 will only look after the privileged few.\"\n\nJo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: \"The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and will be standing on a manifesto to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50.\"\n\nJohnson's election bill will now pass to the House of Lords, which by convention is unlikely to amend it after it has passed the Commons.\n\nThe victory for the prime minister came after he welcomed back 10 of the 21 Conservative MPs he expelled from the party last month.\n\nAlistair Burt, Caroline Nokes, Greg Clark, Nick Soames, Ed Vaizey, Margot James, Stephen Hammond, Steve Brine, Richard Harrington, and Richard Benyon all had the Conservative whip restored on Tuesday after voting to prevent a no-deal Brexit last month.\n\nThe returning members all backed Johnson on votes on his Brexit bill last week. Other former MPs, including the former Conservative chancellors Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, have not been welcomed back.\n\nJohnson's path to a majority could be narrow\n\nJeremy Corbyn and Johnson. Getty\n\nJohnson's Conservative Party goes into the 2019 UK general election campaign as the favourites to emerge as the winners of the contest.\n\nRecent opinion polls give them an average lead of 10 points over Labour. This is in large part because of Johnson's success in uniting pro-Brexit voters behind his party, in contrast to the splintering of anti-Brexit voters between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nHowever, polling experts suggest that he may struggle to win the parliamentary majority he seeks.\n\nThe UK's leading elections expert, John Curtice, told LBC on Tuesday that smaller parties were expected to make big gains at the polls, potentially denying Johnson a majority.\n\nHe added that unlike in 2010, when the Conservatives secured a parliamentary majority thanks to the Liberal Democrats entering into a coalition, Johnson would struggle to find partners to prop up his government in another hung parliament.\n\n\"This is an asymmetric election,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an election that Boris Johnson has to win. If he does not get a majority or something very close to it, he will not be able to stay in government because the Conservatives do not have any friends elsewhere.\n\n\"The Labour Party, by contrast, at least has the possibility of doing a deal with the SNP, a deal with the Liberal Democrats, getting support of the Greens and maybe even the DUP not standing in their way.\n\n\"Bear in mind, this is not an election that Labour have to win to stop Brexit, but it is an election that they and the other opposition parties simply need to deny the Conservatives a majority.\"", "description": "The House of Commons voted in favour of a bill brought forward by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to hold an election before Christmas.", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Thomas Colson", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db87ab7dee0191d445fdcc2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
