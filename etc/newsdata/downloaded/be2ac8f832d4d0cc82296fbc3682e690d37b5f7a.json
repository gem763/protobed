He didn't say it was despicable, which is what I say.\"\n\nHe went on to add: \"If you make art that\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s a sin\u2026.When I was hired to do The Godfather, I tried to do something that was personal, even though I was hired.\n\n\"It\u2019s not that you\u2019re getting hired that\u2019s bad, but just to think of it in terms of some sort of industry success. I would like everyone to make really personal films.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the face of criticism of his movies, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn posted on Instagram to express his thoughts and feelings on the comments from Coppola and Scorsese.\n\nGunn captioned an image of Guardians characters Groot and Rocket with: \"Many of our grandfathers thought all gangster movies were the same, often calling them \u201cdespicable\u201d.\n\n\"Some of our great grandfathers thought the same of westerns, and believed the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone were all exactly the same.\n\n\"I remember a great uncle to whom I was raving about Star Wars. He responded by saying, \u201cI saw that when it was called 2001, and, boy, was it boring!\u201d Superheroes are simply today\u2019s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers.\n\n\"Some superhero films are awful, some are beautiful. Like westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And that\u2019s okay.\"\n\nWhose side of the debate are you on?\n\nLet us know your thoughts on Marvel movies in the comments below.", "description": "Coppola goes a step further than director Martin Scorsese who has claimed the superhero films are \"not cinema\", as James Gunn responds", "authors": ["Lewis Knight", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665939.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FRANCE-CULTURE-CINEMA-FESTIVAL-LUMIERE-AWARD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
