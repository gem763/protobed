As crisp as autumn leaves, lumpia are famously made in large quantities and best enjoyed with loved ones. Like their delicious cousin, the egg roll, they originated in China, and were wholeheartedly adopted and then reinvented in the Philippines along with other neighboring island nations. They are a gateway into an underrepresented cuisine\u2014a gustatory delight for palates of all ethnicities. But finally, after decades of being unacknowledged by America\u2019s foodie culture, non-Filipinos are beginning to explore what lies beyond the lumpia when it comes to Filipino cuisine.\n\nAccording to Diana Ting Liu Wu\u2019s Asian Pacific Americans in the Workplace, a collection of case studies that examines the position of Asian Pacific Americans in the U.S. workforce, there are more ethnic Filipinos in Los Angeles \"than in any other city except Manila.\u201d Since the book\u2019s publication in 1997, LA\u2019s Filipinx diaspora has significantly increased, so it\u2019s strange that in a county with the largest population of Filipino-Americans, their food is not fully ingrained into the city\u2019s culinary culture. As the late Filipino writer, teacher, cultural historian, and food critic Doreen Fernandez was quoted as saying in a recent New York Times profile, \u201cOne did not take bosses, foreigners, dates or VIPs to have Filipino food at a restaurant; it wasn\u2019t considered \u2018dignified enough.\u201d\u2019\n\nHowever, that perception has finally changed.\n\nLumpia at Barkada. Photo by Miles Najera\n\nOn the corner of a Hollywood strip mall on Vine Street, adjacent to a Cuban supper club that bumps salsa music at 120 decibels, sits Barkada\u2014a hip, nascent Filipino tapas restaurant and lounge that offers live music, moody lighting, and community fundraisers. Run by longtime friends Paul Montoya, Jay Baluyot, and French-trained chef Josh Robles, Barkada was opened in 2017. Their friendship yielded the restaurant\u2019s name, which is Tagalog for your clique, crew, gang, tribe, or whatever you call your chosen family, and the food is an amalgamation of traditional family recipes and chef Robles\u2019 innovative Asian-inspired creations. When asked who owns the joint, they simply reply: \u201cIt\u2019s a family business.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all started because we wanted to represent Filipino food in a different way,\u201d says Montoya, over a plate of his Lola\u2019s (Tagalog for grandmother) famed calamansi chicken wings. \u201cGrowing up in LA, people used to joke around with us, saying we eat dogs and cats. That was a common thing I\u2019d hear back in the day\u2014that\u2019s what people thought about Filipino food.\u201d\n\nCharles Olalia\u2019s popular Ma\u2019am Sir in Silver Lake\u2014who Montoya and Baluyot fondly consider to be part of their \u2018barkada\u2019\u2014is among the new wave of restaurants to spark this gustatory renaissance. After attending culinary school in Manila, Olalia moved stateside, ultimately landing in Los Angeles. He first opened Rice Bar, a successful counter restaurant in DTLA that served Filipino-inspired grain bowls, which built the foundation for him to expand with Ma\u2019am Sir. Serving reimagined classics like sizzling pork sisig and banana bibingka\u2014typically a baked rice cake that is sometimes topped with salted duck egg and especially popular during Christmas\u2014Ma\u2019am Sir has been lauded by the media, including a glittering write-up in the Los Angeles Times earlier this year.\n\nWhile most signs point to positive in regards to the popularization of Filipino food, is there a risk of losing its authenticity?\n\nTucked away in strip malls and Filipino neighborhoods across the city, Filipino restaurants in LA have often been overlooked by non-Filipinos, and usually contain mostly, if not all, Filipinx patrons. Almost anyone who passes a sushi or pho restaurant knows exactly what is served. However, the Filipino food vernacular is commonly relegated to those who grew up eating it (and those with Filipinx relatives or close friends). Turo turo joints\u2014Tagalog for \u201cpoint point,\u201d referring to the way in which the food is ordered\u2014are popular among the diaspora, but unbeknownst to most non-Filipinx Angelenos. In group dining scenarios when restaurant suggestions are made, you will likely hear mentions of Thai, ramen, Korean barbecue, pho, sushi, and Indian joints\u2014Asian cuisines recognized the world over. Rarely will Filipino food be included in the conversation.\n\nThe team at Barkada. Photo by Miles Najera\n\nFood has long been a gateway to cultural understanding. Anthony Bourdain brought the people and cuisines of tension-filled regions like Israel and Congo directly into our living rooms, examining conflict through the lens of food. Conflict Kitchen in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania rotates its menu depending on the people or country with which the United States is in conflict, encouraging patrons to reshape their understanding of the culture, politics, and issues of the focus region. Based on the impact that Bourdain and establishments like Conflict Kitchen have made, using food to incite dialogue and connection works, and now more than ever, people of all ethnic backgrounds are open-minded to trying foreign foods like the Filipino delicacy balut (fetal duck egg\u2014which Bourdain has eaten, and enjoyed, on-camera multiple times).\n\nBut while most signs point to positive in regards to the popularization of Filipino food, is there a risk of losing its authenticity?\n\nThe ubiquity of Japanese and Chinese foods are good representations of the proliferation of Asian cuisine in the U.S. While sushi and potstickers have become household names, these food traditions have been diluted and modified to better suit Western palates and aesthetics. The ever-popular inside-out California roll, for example\u2014placing the nori seaweed on the inside and the rice on the outside to make the roll appear more appetizing\u2014was created in North America. And as many might already know, the fortune cookie is not a tradition in China.\n\nAt Barkada, as well as several other modern Filipino restaurants like Ma\u2019am Sir, the goal is to represent Filipino food in a new and playful way. By taking traditional dishes like chicken adobo and elevating the ingredients\u2014Barkada subs chicken for beef short ribs\u2014the traditional flavors are still the foundation, just reinvented (much like pancit, which was created after China introduced noodles to the Philippines). Instead of offering large portions of these dishes, typical of most Filipino restaurants, non-Filipinos who are new to the flavors and words of Filipino food are able to try small portions without committing to one large dish, creating a perfect entry point for those unfamiliar with the cuisine. But, like Japanese and Chinese food, a bit of the tradition gets lost in the innovation.\n\nThe calamansi chicken wings at Barkada. Photo by Miles Najera\n\n\u201cA lot of Filipinos love seeing these elevated versions of classic recipes but some of the purists don't get it,\u201d Baluyot explains while pointing to a dish of short rib kare-kare, a savory peanut-based stew traditionally cooked with oxtail. \u201cThat's what always happens with generation gaps, though, no matter the culture. Whenever a new generation changes something that hasn\u2019t changed for a long time, the older generation doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nBecause Filipino food is still in its nascency in America, most Filipinx restaurateurs including, Montoya and Baluyot, believe the popularization of their beloved cuisine doesn\u2019t risk losing anything. In fact, they believe it has more to gain than to lose. Nicole Ponseca, author of I Am a Filipino: And This Is How We Cook and the founder of Maharlika and Jeepney restaurants in New York City echoes their sentiment about this proliferation. Though her career began in advertising, she discovered her true calling after noticing New York City\u2019s lack of authentic Filipino food and dedicated her life to changing that.\n\n\u201cFrom my days of advertising, I knew that Filipinos had no representation in media,\u201d Ponseca shares. \u201cI had no intention of being a restaurant person, I was just trying to find the easiest way to make an impact. Restaurants are by no means easy, but food was the easiest way I could translate culture and dimensionalize people. I've been at this for 20 years and when I started there was very little representation for Filipinos\u2014not that I'm the first Filipino restaurant\u2014but I think that we were the first to do it in a way that was political and offered a social commentary on representation. We knew that if we did it well, it would keep the door open for other Filipino restaurants, chefs, and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that going into it I would be deconstructing colonialism. It\u2019s not just a restaurant, it\u2019s about how I can push Filipino food forward so there\u2019s no sense of euphemisms, there's no dumbing things down.\u201d\n\nWhere Barkada seeks to introduce Filipino cuisine through the modernization of old family recipes, Ponseca\u2019s goal is to serve purely traditional dishes, such as the aforementioned balut, and dinuguan, a rich, pork stew simmered in pig\u2019s blood, garlic, chili, and vinegar. While offering a contemporary setting\u2014most cafeteria-style Filipino restaurants are devoid of trendy ambiance\u2014Ponseca aids in the purging of shame and exoticism around foreign foods.\n\nPhoto by Marts Romero\n\n\u201cWhen you stop talking about exoticism, that's when we become part of the lexicon,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis is what we eat and we\u2019re not ashamed or on display. It's not a raised eyebrow. It\u2019s not being embarrassed when you open your Tupperware of food at school. When our story becomes normalized, we gain interest and respect and appreciation.\u201d\n\nMany modern Filipino restaurants, including Barkada, Jeepney, and Maharlika, have introduced their diverse crowds of diners to kamayan (Tagalog for \u201cby hand\u201d) feasts, a style of Filipino cuisine where banana leaves are splayed on a table and piled with seafood, meat, rice and vegetables, eaten sans silverware. This was a standard way of eating in the Philippines before Spanish conquistadors colonized the archipelago in 1565 and introduced cutlery.\n\n\u201cI did a lot of fucking research here; it wasn\u2019t just me opening up a restaurant,\u201d Ponseca declares. \u201cI knew that going into it I would be deconstructing colonialism. It\u2019s not just a restaurant, it\u2019s about how I can push Filipino food forward so there\u2019s no sense of euphemisms, there's no dumbing things down.\u201d\n\n\u201cFilipino food is finally getting acknowledged ... It has a few more years to becoming a household name, like other Asian cuisines, but I\u2019m excited to see where it goes next.\"\n\nNow, Filipino food is having its long-awaited moment. In an era where adventurous eating is cool, helped in part by Anthony Bourdain, the door for other underrepresented cuisines to find their limelight in American food culture is wide open. Whether it be through innovation, fusion, or standing by tradition, Filipino food has earned a seat at the table.\n\nPhoto by Marts Romero\n\n\u201cFilipino food is finally getting acknowledged,\u201d Montoya shares. \u201cIt has a few more years to becoming a household name, like other Asian cuisines, but I\u2019m excited to see where it goes next. Even if it\u2019s the fusion places that are putting it on the map right now, it\u2019s a gateway to the traditional spots that have always existed. And that's a good thing.\u201d", "description": "The young chefs behind the evolving new wave of Filipino food are more than ready to share their beloved cuisine with a bigger audience.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6ecf0904e5f00008fb4469/lede/1567543708466-jeepney-maharlika-2.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7025xh;0xw,0.2975xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
