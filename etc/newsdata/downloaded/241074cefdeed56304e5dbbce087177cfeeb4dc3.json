Likely a theft in plain sight", "language": "en", "text": "Wizard Rock, which went missing from Prescott National Forest in October, 2019. (Photo: Prescott National Forest photo)\n\nSomeone \u2014 or more likely several people \u2014 stole a picturesque boulder known as Wizard Rock from along a roadside near Prescott, Arizona, about two weeks ago.\n\nAnd there's a good chance the theft occurred in plain sight, reports The Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThe landmark rock is a black boulder with white quartz running through it that weighs about a ton. It was a familiar landmark to many folks driving on State Route 89 near White Spar Road south of Prescott.\n\nThe rock was a popular photo stop for motorists, Prescott National Forest officials said.\n\nForest officials are asking the public to share any information related to the removal of the boulder.\n\nRock too big to move by hand\n\nTrails and Wilderness Manager Jason Williams said it most likely took someone operating heavy equipment to remove the rock.\n\nClose up of Wizard Rock, which went missing from Prescott National Forest in October, 2019. (Photo: Prescott National Forest photo)\n\n\u201cThe easy way to do it would be a back hoe,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut, if you had a trailer positioned properly and didn\u2019t mind beating some things up you might be able to do it with a Bobcat. But you surely aren\u2019t going to be able to do it any other way.\u201d\n\nHe said it would be hard to get enough people around the limited surface area of the rock to lift it without equipment. Using heavy equipment to move the boulder may be part of the reason no one reported the rock going missing.\n\n\u201cI think what happens is the general public, if they see somebody working with equipment in the forest, they see the equipment and assume it\u2019s an authorized thing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt looks professional and they think they must be doing something the forest service has said \u2018go ahead\u2019 or even paid for.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the forest service sometimes uses boulders to delineate areas where visitors can drive or park from off-limits areas. The boulders are either moved from other parts of the forest or purchased, he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier to have somebody deliver it and drop it in place than for me to go harvest one with a backhoe and a dump truck and trailer and all that stuff.\u201d Williams said.\n\nHe said purchased boulders cost $100-$200 per ton, depending on the uniqueness or beauty of the stone.\n\nOther boulders have been taken\n\nWizard Rock is not the only boulder to have gone missing in the past four months. Individuals using heavy equipment also removed boulders on Dearing Road near Thumb Butte Road in Prescott.\n\nIn 2009, an 80-pound heart-shaped rock was taken from Granite Mountain Wilderness. A local newspaper ran a story about the theft which led to its return. The person returned the rock anonymously, saying they didn\u2019t realize how much it meant to other people.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Sarah Clawson, district ranger for Prescott National Forest's Bradshaw Ranger District, said it was unfortunate to lose such a treasure as Wizard Rock.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that it will be returned to us, and these recent recurring events will become an educational opportunity\" Clawson wrote. \u201cThese boulders belong to the public, and should be enjoyed by locals and visitors for years to come.\"\n\nIt's illegal to take things without a permit\n\nOfficials are seeking the public\u2019s help in finding out what happened to Wizard Rock. It is illegal to remove minerals from National Forest land without a permit.\n\nA violation could result in a maximum fine of $5,000, six months in jail or both.\n\nAnyone with information is urged to call 928-443-8110.\n\nPermits are required to take most forest products, including rocks, minerals, firewood, plants and trees. For more information on permits, call the national forest you're planning to visit.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/29/stolen-boulder-arizona-landmark-wizard-rock-rock-missing/2499931001/", "description": "Arizona forest officials figure someone must have used heavy equipment to move Wizard Rock, a landmark boulder, that weighs a ton.", "authors": ["Weldon B.
