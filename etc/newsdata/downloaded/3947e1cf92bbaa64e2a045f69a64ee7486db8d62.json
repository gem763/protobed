The statement went on to ask and answer 10 questions surrounding Kaepernick.\n\nANTONIO BROWN HAS REQUEST FOR NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS FANS AMID GRIEVANCE CASE WITH TEAM\n\n\u201cNot a single team has offered Colin a job since the 2016 season, in which he began as a peaceful protest,\" it said.\n\n\u201cNot a single team has brought Colin in for a workout. Seattle brought Colin in for a visit but did not work him out. Afterwards, [Seahawks coach] Pete Carroll said Colin is a \u2018starter in this league.\u2019 No other NFL team has interviewed or worked out Colin the past 3 seasons, despite other false statements in the media to the contrary.\u201d\n\nThe agents also denied that Kaepernick has ever asked for a specific salary. The letter then addressed why Kaepernick opted out of his contract after the 2016 season.\n\n\u201cColin opted out after his conversation with the 49ers GM John Lynch, who told Colin they were going to cut him and publicly stated, \u2018I don\u2019t want to characterize it as he made a decision to leave here\u2026 You can opt out, we can release you,\u2019\" they said. \"Colin opted out prior to free agency to maximize potential employment opportunities and because the 49ers would have cut him prior to the start of the 2017 season.\"\n\nNFL UPHOLDS OAKLAND RAIDERS LINEBACKER VONTAZE BURFICT'S SEASON-LONG SUSPENSION\n\nThe NFL has seen several starting quarterbacks go down over the last two seasons. This season, at least five teams have seen their starting quarterbacks get taken out because of injury. The New York Giants and Washington Redskins have swapped veteran quarterbacks with rookies, while the Miami Dolphins have used both Ryan Fitzpatrick and Josh Rosen this season. The Indianapolis Colts decided to stick with Jacoby Brissett after Andrew Luck abruptly retired prior to the start of the season.\n\n\u201cIn summary, it is difficult to think of another young player in NFL history with statistics and character as impressive as Colin\u2019s not being given an opportunity to earn a spot on an NFL roster after what he has accomplished,\u201d Kaepernicks' agents said in the statement.\n\nIn Kaepernick\u2019s final season with the 49ers, he passed for 2,241 yards with 16 touchdowns and four interceptions. He led San Francisco to their second win of the season in Week 16 against the Los Angeles Rams. He threw a touchdown pass to Rod Streater and then ran the ball in for the go-ahead two-point conversion with 31 seconds left in the game.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSince he left the 49ers, he\u2019s become the face of Nike but has yet to find a new home.", "description": "Colin Kaepernick\u2019s representatives released a memo Thursday trying to debunk what they called \u201cfalse narratives\u201d surrounding the free-agent quarterback who has not played in the league since the 2016 season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
