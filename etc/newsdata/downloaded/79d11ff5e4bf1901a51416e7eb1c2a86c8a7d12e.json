They [the Turks] ship a lot of steel to the United States. They make a lot of money shipping steel; they won\u2019t be making so much money.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said his administration is being \u201ctough\u201d on Turkey and others in the region in an effort to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThey have to maintain their own properties now; they have to maintain peace and safety,\u201d the president said of Turkey and its neighbors. \u201cWe want to bring our soldiers back home after so many years.
