She swore she was happy to be curvy - now she's lost three stone", "language": "en", "text": "Along with that once-in-a-generation voice, Adele\u2019s curves have been one of the defining features of her super-stardom. But, as breathtaking pictures from a Hollywood party have revealed, they are no longer an issue.\n\nThe London-born singer will never have to say she doesn\u2019t care a jot about being fat \u2014 because she isn\u2019t.\n\nAdele showed off her svelte new figure at the 33rd birthday party of her American rapper friend Drake on Wednesday night, wearing a \u00a31,160 off-the-shoulder black velvet gown.\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when the 31-year-old wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of displaying so much flesh.\n\nSinger Adele appeared this week with a svelte new figure (left) as she attended a party. She is pictured in 2013, right\n\nThe singer was pictured looking slim and athletic in a stunning black gown to mark Drake's birthday\n\n\u2018I used to cry but now I sweat,\u2019 she joked later on social media, amid claims she has lost 3 st.\n\nSo how did she do it? And, given her previous insistence that she was proud of her appearance, why did she do it?\n\nA new diet, a new exercise regime, a new group of glamorous (and skinny) celebrity friends and her new single status since her marriage break-up may all have contributed to the singer\u2019s stunning transformation . . .\n\nMother of all health kicks In truth, Adele has been building towards this transformation moment for some years, in part because of motherhood. She gave up smoking, which she once described as \u2018my favourite thing to do in the world\u2019, several years ago after a course of hypnotherapy. Adele is pictured smoking outside a London spa 10 years ago \u2018I loved it, but it\u2019s not that cool when I\u2019m dying from a smoking-related illness and my kid is, like, devastated,\u2019 she said. The same has been true of drinking. Four years ago, she claimed she had cut down to perhaps a drink a week. \u2018I used to be able to drink anyone under the table,\u2019 she said. \u2018But with kids, hangovers are torture. They just pick up on it and go for you.\u2019 Adele had previously loved a pint (pictured above in 2008)\n\nHer major wake-up call\n\nIn the past, Adele has insisted she doesn\u2019t care about how she looks. \u2018I have never been insecure, ever, about how I look,\u2019 she told the Mail in 2009. \u2018My mum told me only ever to do things for myself, not for others.\u2019\n\nShe sounded equally bullish three years later when she told a U.S. magazine: \u2018I\u2019ve never wanted to look like models on the covers of magazines. I represent the majority of women and am proud of that.\u2019\n\nIn fact, she believed her size had contributed to her success, rather than detracted from it.\n\n\u2018Fans are encouraged that I\u2019m not a size zero \u2014 that you don\u2019t have to look a certain way to do well,\u2019 she told Vogue a decade ago when she appeared as its cover star.\n\nIn the past few years, she admitted she did have \u2018body image problems\u2019 but insisted: \u2018I don\u2019t let them rule my life\u2019. After all, she reasoned: \u2018There\u2019s only one of you, so why would you want to look like everyone else?\u2019\n\nIt appears she has since decided it would be better for her health if she shed a few pounds. In 2016, she was back on the cover of Vogue but explaining: \u2018I was trying to get some stamina for my tour, so I lost a bit of weight.\u2019\n\nThe singer who once scoffed at the notion that she would ever fit into the standard mould of the showbusiness star certainly looks like one now.\n\nReluctant gym bunny\n\nLike many other British performers, Adele has sounded uncomfortable with the narcissism of the gym-obsessed mindset of U.S. celebrity. She\u2019s dismissed the notion that she had much of an exercise regime, conceding she did visit the gym \u2018to get in shape for myself, but not to be a size zero\u2019.\n\nAsked about what she did there, she said: \u2018Mainly moan.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m not, like, skipping to the f****** gym. I don\u2019t enjoy it.\u2019\n\nShe conceded she did like doing weights, but revealed that blood vessels burst in her face easily, which puts her off straining them by lifting anything too heavy. She has discovered there are other, less blood vessel-bursting, ways of shifting the pounds.\n\nShe hired a personal trainer, Pete Geracimo, left, whose clients have included David Hasselhoff and Kim Cattrall. He persuaded her to combine weight-lifting with cardiovascular exercise to ensure she looked curvy rather than muscly.\n\nIn July, it was reported she was doing 60-minute sessions that include cardio workouts, circuit training and Pilates.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s found a routine that\u2019s working for her and is enjoying it more,\u2019 said a source.\n\nA month earlier, when she showed off her new, trimmer figure at a Spice Girls concert in London, it emerged she had started practising Reformer Pilates \u2014 a machine-aided version of the exercise system \u2014 in London after being introduced to it by close friend Ayda Field, the wife of former Take That star Robbie Williams and a known exercise junkie.\n\nSomewhat agonising but effective in improving posture and flexibility, Reformer classes use a bed-like frame with a flat platform which rolls backwards and forwards. It\u2019s great for toning the figure and strengthening the core.\n\nAnother fan, the Duchess of Sussex, once called Reformer Pilates \u2018the best thing you could do for your body\u2019.\n\nHer weight loss is thought to have something to do with her personal trainer Peter Geracimo (above)\n\nMixing with the skinny set\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Adele scoffed at the very notion of being a superstar, saying she was sure she\u2019d always feel \u2018overwhelmed\u2019 and out of place in the presence of A-list celebrities \u2014 a feeling she attributed to her humble roots in working class North London.\n\nMindful of what happened to fellow Londoner Amy Winehouse, she said she was \u2018really frightened\u2019 of fame, adding: \u2018I think it\u2019s really toxic, and I think it\u2019s really easy to be dragged into it.\u2019\n\nSwapping cakes for kale Adele insists she lost two stone by cutting out the ten cups of tea \u2014 each sweetened with two spoonfuls of sugar \u2014 that she drank every day, as well as junk food and biscuits. Since 2016, she has also adopted the Sirtfood Diet. Her new diet focuses on plant-based foods The diet is based on stimulating sirtuins, the so-called \u2018longevity genes\u2019. It cuts down on meat, and focuses on plant-based food such as apples, kale, buckwheat and green tea.\n\nWas her consciousness of her size also holding her back? Certainly, her new look coincides with her having gained a bevvy of skinny new famous friends, which suggests that she has lost her shyness in their company.\n\nThey include Hollywood stars Emma Stone, Kate Hudson, Cameron Diaz, and Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nAdele joined the Hunger Games star and face of Dior for a riotous night out in New York on the actress\u2019s hen night. Insiders say Lawrence \u2014 who, like Adele, loves to let her hair down \u2014 has become a huge inspiration to Adele and this could be seen in April when the latter appeared looking completely transformed during a visit to Manhattan.\n\nShe was perfectly made up and wearing a \u00a33,000 Balenciaga coat and gold-capped designer heels. She had even had platinum blonde streaks put into her hair \u2014 just like her friend.\n\nLawrence is a tough act to follow, and entailed Adele sharpening up her act on the diet and exercise fronts.\n\nIndeed, Adele is not only surrounded by slim friends, but friends who are fixated with staying that way.\n\nOne of these, of course, is Ayda Field, whose husband Robbie Williams has had his own issues with his weight, and is a brand ambassador for Weight Watchers, as is Kate Hudson, actress daughter of Goldie Hawn.\n\nFuelling a fashion frenzy\n\nThere will be one group of people who will be particularly delighted by Adele\u2019s new slimmer look \u2014 fashion designers. She has had style advice from the likes of U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, but it has sometimes seemed a challenge. Tent-like and shapeless was the order of the day.\n\nThe late designer Karl Lagerfeld put it bluntly when he called Adele \u2018a little too fat\u2019. Of course, many designers would happily have women stick thin, but Adele has herself conceded that her wardrobe choices have in the past been limited by what she can fit into.\n\nWhen she lost a little weight in 2016, it gave her an appetite for clothes shopping. \u2018Now I fit into normal, off-the-shelf clothes \u2014 which is a really big problem for me!\u2019 she joked.\n\nShe now employs the services of celebrity stylist Gaelle Paul, whose others clients include Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nAnd as the sexy black velvet gown she wore this week shows, her wardrobe is her oyster now.", "description": "London-born singer Adele will never have to say she doesn't care a jot about being fat - because she isn't.
