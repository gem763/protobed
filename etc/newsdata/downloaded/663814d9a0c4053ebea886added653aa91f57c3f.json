Sies.\"\n\nRamaphosa's speech, which focused on Biko's pursuit of finding the humanity in everyone, called on the wealthy to plough back into communities in need.\n\nWithout mentioning the recent Steinhoff scandal, which affected billions of pension fund investments, or disgraced Steinhoff CEO Marcus Jooste, the president referred to business people whose reckless and fraudulent actions eroded the savings of many ordinary people.\n\nHe also did not mention the infamous Gupta family by name. Instead, he spoke of the actions of a family which had adverse effects on the country.\n\n\"Astounded as we are by the devastating audacity of one family and their associates, we should not be blinded to the corruption that has taken [hold] in many institutions across government. This requires firm, decisive and united action,\" said Ramaphosa.\n\nThe Guptas are accused of having undue influence over former president Jacob Zuma, using it to loot from state coffers and make executive decisions.\n\n\"We have begun the work, but there is much more to do. Commissions of inquiry, disciplinary hearings, criminal prosecution and lengthy prison sentences are necessary instruments to tackle this scourge,\" he said to some cheers.\n\nRamaphosa's comments come after Zuma's remarks at Walter Sisulu University this week, in which he described state capture as a \"politically-decorated expression\".", "description": "The Gupta family, the Steinhoff scandal and the state capture commission of inquiry have found their way into the lecture which President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered in honour of struggle icon Steve Biko.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7923/2c5e91c6f4b847ca8eab0ed548205f03.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-14"}
