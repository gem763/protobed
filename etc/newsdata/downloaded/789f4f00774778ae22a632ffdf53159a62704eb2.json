He held a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday night. (Oct 11) AP, AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump took a musical trip down memory lane at a Thursday rally at the Target Center in Minneapolis.\n\nHe recalled when Bruce Springsteen, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z campaigned for Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016, and he even gave the Boss a new nickname.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, I didn\u2019t need little Bruce Springsteen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey had all these people, they'd come in because she couldn't get a crowd.\u201d\n\nSpringsteen and fellow New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi performed at Clinton's election-eve rally at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 2016.\n\n\u201cThey got Bruce Springsteen. He'd do about two songs, then leave, and what happens? Everyone leaves with him,\u201d said Trump, in a backhand compliment. \u201cAnd (Clinton's) still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. Craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nTrump feels there's a double standard when it comes to him and Jay-Z.\n\n\u201cThen they'd complain that I'd use a terrible word like \u2018hell\u2019,\u201d said Trump, pointing to the media at the Target Center. \u201cBut you got to hear Jay-Z, the words he was using, the F-word all over the place and then then next day they say I use bad language. The word hell is a terrible word.\u201d\n\nTrump's riff on Springsteen, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's crowd sizes and language is not new. He had a similar take on the 2016 election at a 2018 rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.\n\nMonmouth County: Was Trump banner obscene?

And then she brought in Bruce Springsteen and they would draw crowds that were smaller than my crowd.\u201d\n\nBoth Springsteen and Jay-Z have been critical of Trump and his policies.\n\nChris Jordan, a Jersey Shore native, covers entertainment and features for the USA Today Network New Jersey.
