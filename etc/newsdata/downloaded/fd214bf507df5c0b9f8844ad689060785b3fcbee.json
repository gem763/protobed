At a mere 7 inches, the smart display is meant to be a personal assistant for any room of the house. Because the Nest Hub lacks a camera, it's even good for the bedroom. Once Nicole started using the Nest Hub like a digital photo frame, albeit one with the smarts to control home automated devices that can also use Google apps, she began to see the strengths of this discreet commected display. In the end, she granted the Nest Hub a commendable score of 87. User reviewers, who always tend to score more harshly, gave the Nest Hub a passable score of 72. Here's where they differed, or agreed with Nicole, on the product's successes and shortcomings.\n\nHardware\n\nNicole felt the Nest Hub's no-frills design and fabric-clad hardware gave it a minimalist, friendly look that helped it naturally blend into a room. On this, user Richard agreed with her, stating that \"looks-wise, it's pretty sleek and doesn't look like the monolithic block that Amazon went with for the Alexa so it blends in a little better.\" However, bxstrb said they had some issues with the huge bezels around the device, though they admitted this was \"more of an aesthetic preference on my end.\"\n\nGoogle Home Hub Ambient EQ More\n\nAmbient EQ\n\nAt the top of the Nest Hub's display is a small sensor that works with Ambient EQ, a feature that automatically detects the lighting in a room and adjusts the Nest Hub's screen to match. Though it only works when the display is in standby, Nicole found this particularly useful in a nightstand device. Some user reviewers enjoyed the feature, with jpfeifer saying \"the light from this thing is less intrusive than most alarm clocks I've used,\" and bxstrb finding that the screen on the Nest Hub \"is better than my Echo Show when adjusting to ambient light throughout the day.\"\n\nHowever, HangmansNoose counted the feature as a con: \"The display gets way too dim in dark rooms,\" they stated, and \"you can adjust the brightness for when the Hub is active, but the light sensor automatically drops it back down to the lowest brightness setting once the Hub goes idle. It dims itself to the point where it is barely readable.\" Ssallen concurred, saying the \"screen brightness drops so low when the lights are off that it's not easy to see the time. I wish they would bump up the brightness even just 5-10 [percent].\"\n\nGoogle Home Hub More\n\nStory continues", "description": "It took senior editor Nicole Lee a bit of time to figure out where the Google Nest Hub (originally the Google Home Hub) fit into her life because it seemed too small to be used like a typical home assistant device.
