One that is even bigger", "language": "en", "text": "Vimy the shark with his head wound (OCEARCH/Robert Snow)\n\nOcean researchers have pulled a 13-foot long great white shark from the seas which had bite marks from an even bigger predator.\n\nThe giant shark, named Vimy by researchers, was caught off the coast of Nova Scotia earlier this month.\n\nBut however big Vimy is, there was a shark that was even bigger in the waters, experts discovered.\n\nThe large great white was found with a large bloody bite wound along his head.\n\nVimy was discovered in Nova Scotia (OCEARCH/Robert Snow) More\n\nAnd the team that found him, US-based OCEARCH, said that means the bite must have come from a shark measuring a minimum of 14 feet.\n\nThey said Vimy\u2019s attacker had to be \u201csignificantly bigger\u201d.\n\n\"It was clear that something had just grabbed his entire head,\u201d said OCEARCH\u2019s Chris Fischer.\n\n\"It was a very large animal that grabbed it, something significantly bigger \u2026 anything that can grab an animal like that by the head is pretty impressive\".\n\nFischer added that it was possible Vimy had been bitten by another male over a mate - or even by a bigger female who didn't want to mate.\n\nMr Fischer said: \"We do know that shark mating is very violent. Sharks biting each other in the head is not a new thing.\n\n\u201cThis is an everyday part of their life.\"\n\nVimy was later released back in to the ocean (OCEARCH/Robert Snow) More\n\nVimy was later released back into the sea with a tracker attached.\n\nVimy was not the only shark caught by the team during their expedition.\n\nEarlier, the team also found a female shark measuring almost five metres in length, the second biggest female shark they had captured.\n\nFortunately for Vimy, white sharks have the ability to heal rapidly!
