As it happens, Professor Monroe's quantum computer also used 53 qubits \u2013 not because that's a magic number in quantum physics, but because he'd asked his lab staff to assemble a 52-qubit system so he could beat a friend of his from Harvard University who was working on a 51-qubit computer. The lab staff accidentally added one qubit too many.\n\nIn quantum computing, you have to pick your poison. \u2014 Professor Chris Monroe, quantum computing physicist\n\nMonroe's computer calculated something known as a \"magnetic phase transition\" in a system, which was too hard to calculate on a classical computer because the system was too big.\n\n\"We could argue . . . that that was a quantum supremacy experiment. We don't run around calling it 'quantum supremacy' because it wasn't as programmable as a fully programmable quantum computer,\" he says.\n\nBut by all reports, neither was Google's.\n\nFive-year plan\n\nThat gets to the nub of the challenge facing scientists around the world as they work to build a quantum computer: how to build one that has enough qubits that are stable enough and have a low enough error rate to be fully programmable, so they can make calculations that are useful to industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonroe, who co-founded the quantum computing company IonQ (named because those levitating atoms are electrically charged \"ions\", which talk to each other via the attraction and repulsion of that electrical charge), says his atom-based technology should produce a useful quantum computer in the next five years.\n\nLevitating ions have a dramatically lower error rate than technologies such as the semi-conducting qubits being pursued by the University of NSW, or the super-conducting qubits being pursued by Google, IBM and others. Because of this, Monroe argues, they can do more operations with far fewer qubits.\n\nWhere UNSW or Google might need millions or billions of qubits to run an algorithm whilst correcting for the errors in the qubits, IonQ will start to get results that are useful to industry with as few as 200 qubits.\n\nHis technology, however, doesn't have a lock on success. Though ionic qubits have an inherently low error rate, they need to be controlled by lasers, and it's proving tricky to develop lasers that themselves don't add errors to the overall system.\n\n\"In quantum computing, you have to pick your poison,\" says Professor Monroe.\n\n\"You can either have really clean qubits that are hard to control but you don't need too many of them, or you can have crappy qubits and you need a gazillion of them.\"", "description": "As Google, UNSW, IonQ and others all strive to build a useful quantum computer, it's turning out there are are many ways to skin Schr\u00f6dinger's cat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5636%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_180%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/905e33eb3c75629881d204be0e49bb35a83c32ac", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
