Airlines have said they plan to return the jet to service as soon as January \u2014 but that timeline hinges on Boeing satisfying global authorities, some of whom appear increasingly frustrated with the company\u2019s response to the safety issues surrounding the Max.\n\nAD\n\nBoeing said its latest financial results assume 737 Max fixes will be approved by regulators by the end of the year. The company said it plans to increase production of the jet to 57 per month by late 2020, up from its pace of 42 a month currently. Boeing had lowered its production from 52 a month after the grounding in March.\n\nAD\n\nThe company said it plans to lower production of the 787 Dreamliner for two years beginning in late 2020, saying \u201cthe current global trade environment\u201d has altered its plans for the long-haul jetliner.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is scheduled to testify in Congress next week, the first anniversary of the first 737 Max crash. He\u2019s expected to face questions about why the company failed to promptly provide regulators a series of text messages in which a high-level Boeing employee wrote about an \u201cegregious\u201d problem with the plane\u2019s flight-control software and said he \u201cbasically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)\u201d about it.\n\nAD\n\nThe messages show Boeing\u2019s experts had identified critical safety concerns with the Max years ago, even as Boeing executives have publicly argued the company had followed its own rigorous protocols for design and certification of the jet. In a stern letter to Boeing last week, Federal Aviation Administrator Stephen Dickson said: \u201cI expect your explanation immediately.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBoeing\u2019s stock has fallen 24 percent since early March, when a second crash of the 737 Max prompted a grounding of the jet and created new risks for a company that was once a Wall Street darling. Analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded the stock this week, saying the text messages and other disclosures about Boeing\u2019s handling of safety issues \u201cmay shatter the fragile trust between regulators and Boeing.\u201d\n\nThe crisis is already reshaping Boeing\u2019s leadership. Muilenburg, still CEO, was stripped of his title of chairman of the board \u2014 an effort by Boeing\u2019s board to provide a stronger check on his power. Boeing said this week that Kevin McAllister, the executive who oversaw the 737 Max as head of the commercial planes division, resigned from that role and was replaced by company veteran Stan Deal.\n\nAD", "description": "Revenue fell to $20 billion in the third quarter, down 21 percent from a year earlier, Boeing said in a statement on Wednesday.
