The report added that the lack of a \"written procedure\" at Xtra Aerospace was not detected by the FAA, which indicates \"inadequacy of FAA oversight.\"\n\nThe FAA order was part a settlement agreement with the company in which it agreed to waive its right to appeal the revocation to the National Transportation Safety Board or any court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru and David Shepardso in Washinton ; Editing by Anil D'Silva, Franklin Paul and Richard Chang)", "description": "The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday revoked the repair certification of Florida-based Xtra Aerospace LLC, which repaired a sensor suspected of contributing to the catastrophic crash of a Lion Air 737 MAX a year ago.  \"Xtra failed to comply with requirements to repair only aircraft", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TD8roZaJ3lsfstUCxwvS_g--~B/aD01NTk7dz03OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/7c147cabd5825ced4e500913a43dfa26", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
