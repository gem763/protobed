It didn\u2019t come without adversity though, as he had to rally from behind after being controlled on the ground for the first round.\n\nAs soon as Woodson got an opening, he made his opponent pay, which is why he\u2019s pretty confident that Bochniak will try and wrestle him throughout the fight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been my main focus, just keeping this fight standing,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cKeeping it in my world and, because like I said, I know this guy is coming to wrestle, coming to grapple, no matter what he says, and yeah, that was our main focus.\u201d\n\nHe will be stepping into enemy territory when he takes on Boston\u2019s own Bochniak, but Woodson insists he isn\u2019t fazed at all. He took his Contender Series fight in July on short notice and will be making a quick turnaround this Friday, as he looks to make the most of the opportunity.\n\n\u201cI love it, man \u2013 like I really couldn\u2019t pick a better opportunity, a better situation than this,\u201d Woodson said. \u201cI\u2019m glad they gave me a guy with a name right off the bat, and yeah, I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s in enemy territory, back against the wall, odds stacked against me \u2013 that\u2019s my ideal situation. Those are the situations I feel like I thrive in.\u201d\n\nAnd being the much taller fighter, along with Bochniak\u2019s pressure, Woodson says don\u2019t be surprised if we see another incredible finish. He believes it\u2019s the perfect style matchup for him.\n\n\u201cI think the way he comes forward and pushes the action, I think it\u2019ll produce another highlight-reel knockout.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really confident I can take him out in the second round,\u201d Woodson added. \u201cHe comes forward and really pushes the pace, like I said, but I think that\u2019s going to be his downfall in the fight.\u201d", "description": "Sean Woodson isn't buying Kyle Bochniak's pre-fight talk: \"I know this guy is coming to wrestle, coming to grapple, no matter what he says.\"", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sean-woodson-dwcs-21-weigh-in.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
