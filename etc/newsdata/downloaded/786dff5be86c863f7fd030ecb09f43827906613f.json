Michael David Smith at NBC Sports is now reporting that the league has let agents know what players in the XFL can expect to be paid in their first season.\n\nThe average salary, according to the report, will be $55,000. By contrast, the NFL\u2019s minimum salary is $495,000. NBC Sports has more details on the memo sent to agents:\n\nThe memo states that players who are drafted and retained by XFL teams will become full-time employees as of December 4, 2019, and if they remain on a roster they will remain employed through May 31, 2020. Between the base salary, a bonus for being active on game days and a bonus for being on the winning team, the average player will make $55,000 a year.\n\nYou may wonder how that figure stacks up to other leagues around the nation. According to the MLS Players Association, the average player in Major League Soccer makes $138,140. And based on data released several months ago, the wrestling site Heel By Nature reports that the average wrestler in WWE\u2019s development system NXT makes $80,000 annually.\n\nThe NBC Sports report does have one bit of data that might explain why football players might opt for a year of low-paying, physically intense games: the prospect that they\u2019ll get noticed by an NFL team. Smith notes in the article that \u201cthe XFL has promised all players they\u2019ll be free to leave for an NFL contract offer any time after the XFL Championship Game on April 25.\u201d\n\nIn a few more months, we\u2019ll see if that potential opportunity is enough to lure compelling talent onto the gridiron for the XFL\u2019s new season.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at NBC Sports", "description": "", "authors": ["Tobias Carroll"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Xa66r35xxuq21.jpg?fit=960%2C640", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
