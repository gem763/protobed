It\u2019s getting extreme. Anchors, correspondents and journalists are chiming in, so much so that Newsbusters.org is now tracking the more outrageous comments.\n\n\u201cNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd decreed a \u2018National nightmare is upon us.\u2019 CNN host Don Lemon and former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather proclaimed that Donald Trump has \u2018Out-Nixoned Nixon,\u2019\u201d writes analyst Geoffrey Dickens, who is now charting the \u201cmore insane reactions in the media\u201d for the conservative press watchdog.\n\nLawmakers are also bandying around caustic commentary about impeachment, and it too is moving the needle on the political melodrama meter. Voters, however, are tired of it all, and they have a message for Congress, summed up in four words: Get back to work. Pollster Scott Rasmussen reveals all.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, 65% of voters believe Congress is spending more time focused on impeachment rather than issues such as health care and the economy. Fifteen percent disagree and 20% are not sure. However, 62% believe Congress should be more focused on the other issues. Twenty-seven percent disagree and want the focus on impeachment, 11% are not sure,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen says, referring to a ScottRasmussen.com/HarrisX poll of 1,004 voters conducted Oct. 8-9.\n\nAnd by the way, the economy is still a happy place for voters.\n\n\u201cFinally, 50% of adults now rate the economy as good or excellent,\u201d the pollster says.\n\nOn a vaguely related note: Lest we forget the impeachment matter has been called \u201ca witch hunt,\u201d among other things. With that in mind, The Federalist offers a new essay titled \u201c6 Ways the Salem Witch Trials Were Fairer Than Democrats\u2019 Impeachment Inquiry,\u201d written by contributor and lawyer Adam Mill.\n\n\u201cWitches in 1692 knew exactly what law they stood accused of violating because New England witch hunters respected due process more than Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi do,\u201d Mr. Mill observes.\n\nCIVILITY: RONNA STAYS OUT OF IT\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is staying out of the bristling warfare between President Trump and her uncle, Sen. Mitt Romney, Utah Republican.\n\nMr. Romney has recently been deemed the leader of the \u201cRepublican Resistance\u201d against Mr. Trump by several media organizations who say he could unify those GOPers who do not agree with the president.\n\nLest we forget, Mrs. McDaniel was born Ronna Romney, to Mitt\u2019s older brother. She is simply stepping aside when it comes to Trump vs. Romney.\n\n\u201cThey might not be sending each other Christmas cards this year. There\u2019s no lost love between them,\u201d Mrs. McDaniel tells Fox News.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to discuss these situations with each other. They\u2019re grown men. I\u2019m not going to get in the middle. They are perfectly capable of conveying what they think to each other,\u201d she continues, adding that she has not spoken to \u201cUncle Mitt\u201d since the disagreement between him and the president erupted.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cBluffpeachment.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a handy new term coined by American Thinker columnist Gary Gindler, who has this to say about impeaching President Trump.\n\n\u201cThe current situation in Washington is, in the language of poker, a bluff. The Democrats are bluffing; they have only weak cards in their hand. They actually have nothing against Trump. That\u2019s all they have ever had. As it is known, impeachment is simply a vote of no confidence,\u201d Mr. Gindler writes.\n\nNEVER A DULL MOMENT\n\nLongtime protester \u201cpeace mom\u201d Cindy Sheehan has reemerged on public radar. Ms. Sheehan spent years protesting President George W. Bush and his administration after her son, Army Specialist Casey Sheehan, was killed in 2004 while serving in the Iraq War. Ms. Sheehan will be in the nation\u2019s capital all weekend with similar messages.\n\nDuring her time in town, she will lead an \u201cunpermitted\u201d march on the White House \u2014 a march, she says, \u201cthrough the seat of violent imperial power to rage against the institutions, people, and corporate power that make the wars and other oppressions possible.\u201d\n\nHer group will stop in six locations in Washington, including the White House, where they will \u201crage against Republicans\u201d and The Washington Post, where they will \u201crage against propaganda, the 1% and Amazon.\u201d\n\nHer efforts have the blessing of such groups as CodePink, the Answer Coalition and the Libertarian Party of D.C. Ms. Sheehan is also staging an \u201cAnti-imperialism Revolutionary Summit\u201d at a church; find their message at MarchOnPentagon.com.\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE:\n\nFor sale: Main Street manor, a classic southern Colonial home built in 1939 on two-acre corner lot in Ville Platte, Louisiana.
