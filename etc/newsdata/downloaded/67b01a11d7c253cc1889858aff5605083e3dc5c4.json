CREDIT: Kyle and Jackie O\n\nConvicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has opened up in her first live interview since her high-profile release from a notorious prison in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nAppearing with her sister Mercedes on the Kyle and Jackie O show on Wednesday to promote her updated memoir My Story, Corby described her struggle with mental illness while behind bars and how she became \u201ccatatonic\u201d soon after the death of her father Mick in 2008.\n\n\u201cI was out of my mind, literally for about four years,\u201d the 42-year-old said.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even speak. People would have to massage my feet and hands because they would cramp. I was in such a hell in my mind, it\u2019s really hard to go back to to write \u2026 Sorry, I\u2019m going to cry.\u201d\n\nFighting back tears, Corby hit out at critics who \u201caccuse me of faking this\u201d.\n\n\u201cMental illness is real. If I could have lived without mental illness, my mind would be so much better,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt started a few months after my dad died. It was like a (triple) whammy \u2014 dad died, my final appeal came through negative then my mum\u2019s partner died as well. I became a complete fruit loop.\u201d\n\nCorby said she was \u201clike a zombie\u201d.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even move, people would handfeed me and I couldn\u2019t swallow; they had to put water down my throat,\u201d she said.\n\nShe recalled how psychiatrist Jonathan Phillips came over from Australia to see her.\n\n\u201cHe said to Mercedes he\u2019s never experienced looking at someone in a catatonic state, because he\u2019d never experienced that before he didn\u2019t know if I would come out of that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI kind of spoke to him at the time but I was listening to the birds chirping and I thought the birds were telling me to stop talking. I thought he was Mr Squiggle. The birds were telling me, \u2018You can\u2019t let them know anything.\u2019\u201d\n\nCorby said despite her mental state she remembered everything that happened, \u201cespecially my visions, I have flashbacks quite badly\u201d.\n\nShe described getting in trouble with prison guards a number of times.\n\nIn one instance, she was discovered crawling through the ceiling looking for \u201cducks\u201d, and in other and she was caught with a Nokia mobile phone and put in solitary confinement for three weeks.\n\nThe latter incident caused her to develop a phobia of talking on phones, meaning she can now only speak via video chat.\n\nShe revealed she was still with her Sumatran boyfriend, who runs a stand-up paddle shop in Bali, but that she only sees him once a year. He doesn\u2019t want to move to Australia and Corby is \u201cnot ready\u201d to return.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to move here, he loves his life, he\u2019s really busy. I\u2019m allowed (to go back), I\u2019m not black-listed, but I\u2019m not ready,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be looking over my shoulder, I want to enjoy myself and just live.\u201d\n\nCorby was convicted of smuggling cannabis into Indonesia in May, 2005, after the drugs were found in her boogie board bag.\n\nShe was sentenced to 20 years by the Denpasar District Court and went to Kerobokan Prison.\n\nAfter a failed appeal, Corby petitioned Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for clemency due to mental illness.\n\nShe was later released on parole in February 2014, before being deported from Indonesia and returned to Australia on May 27, 2017.\n\nShe said she was no longer upset that people thought she was guilty.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t upset me, people are entitled to their opinions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never going to say it to my face, but there are a lot of people who have a second uncle who worked with a friend who was the cousin of somebody who definitely knows I did it. I just walk away. I don\u2019t need to live my life defending myself \u2026 I\u2019ve got some really dedicated supporters.\u201d\n\nAsked what surprised her most about re-entering modern society after a decade behind bars, Corby said she noticed \u201cthere was a lot of plastic in the supermarkets\u201d.\n\n\u201cEverything is wrapped up. You want to buy a carrot and it\u2019s wrapped in plastic, styrofoam, all this plastic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then they take the plastic bags away, but it\u2019s still in the fruit-and-veg section. It\u2019s full of plastic, so I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nCorby added that her first reaction to Google was \u201cGod it\u2019d suck to be an heir of Funk & Wagnalls\u201d, referring to the American publisher of encyclopedias \u201cthat you have on your bookshelf because no one even opens them anymore\u201d.\n\nShe said the biggest change, however, was the fact that her dad was no longer around. \u201cI still can\u2019t cope with that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think funerals are really important for us living people to say goodbye and I couldn\u2019t say goodbye, so I\u2019m still kind of in this limbo.\u201d\n\nShe also opened up about the famous moment the judge handed down her sentence, when Corby burst out screaming in the courtroom.\n\nShe said by that stage she had learned to count to 20 in Indonesian.\n\n\u201cAt the time I just couldn\u2019t understand \u2013 what does that mean? Maybe that\u2019s two months? Yeah, I\u2019m going home! No, it\u2019s two years. I can do it. No? What the f*** is it then? Twenty years. I was like, \u2018You \u2026\u2019 I start yelling at them, at the prosecutor. I was like a German Shepherd.\u201d\n\nAs she was led away by police she pushed through to her mother for a hug.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going out the door and I have to start 20 years in that s***hole, I need to give them one last hug. They wouldn\u2019t let me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like fighting them off. Just let me give my mum a hug. My mum was like, I\u2019ve lived my life, let my daughter live her life, (let me) swap.\u201d\n\nAsked whether they would have done anything differently in hindsight, the sisters hinted that there could have been another way out of the charges that became impossible due to the media attention.\n\n\u201cThe thing is we didn\u2019t know any information at the time so I\u2019m going to answer no, because we did what we thought we needed to do,\u201d Corby said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand. It happened on a Friday afternoon at 3pm and once the media (got involved) \u2026\u201d\n\nMercedes added, \u201cIt\u2019s a different country and things work differently. Once the media get things, those other ways become difficult.\u201d\n\nQuizzed on her plans going forward, the media-shy Corby responded to rumours of a possible stint on a reality TV show like The Bachelorette or I\u2019m a Celebrity. \u201cNever say never,\u201d she said.\n\nCorby said she would like to find work doing \u201csomething creative\u201d and revealed she had recently started making epoxy resin art.\n\n\u201cI really love it \u2013 it makes my mind think about other things,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can never make the same thing twice.\u201d\n\nfrank.chung@news.com.au", "description": "Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has opened up in her first live interview since her high-profile release from a notorious prison in Bali, Indonesia.", "authors": ["Frank Chung"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3f4a04946e0235b88ae1f95cf9e0712b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
