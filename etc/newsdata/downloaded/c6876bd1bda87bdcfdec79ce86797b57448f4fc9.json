The defensive lineman also went back into the locker room before jogging back onto the sideline in the second quarter.\n\nAllen, however, was unable to return.\n\n\u201cHe was out there walking around pretty good,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe thought the risk was a little bit too great right now with it being a fresh injury.\u201d\n\nIf Allen were to miss multiple weeks, that would be a significant loss for the Redskins\u2019 defense. The 2017 first-rounder was one of the Redskins\u2019 best players last season and anchored a defensive line that includes Daron Payne and Matt Ioannidis.\n\nAllen spent all of last season healthy, but missed 11 games his rookie year. The 24-year-old suffered a Lisfranc sprain during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in October and was then placed on injured reserve.\n\nThe Redskins blew a 17-0 lead Sunday against the Eagles, but did not use Allen\u2019s injury as an excuse.\n\nWashington sacked Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz just once. The team primarily sent just four rushers after Wentz, opting to use its linebackers and defensive backs in coverage.\n\n\u201cWe can rush better,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cEven if you rush three, they can rush better. four men has to rush better. If you want to blitz, you can blitz, but you better cover your (butt). .. Great defenses rush four or five guys. We\u2019ve got to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
