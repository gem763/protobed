The complaint and a reconstructed transcript released by the White House formed the basis of the House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.\n\nThe inspector general, Michael Atkinson, handed the two-page memo over to Congress last week. A person familiar with its contents described it to The New York Times. Fox News first reported details from it. Neither a lawyer for the whistle-blower nor a spokeswoman for Mr. Atkinson immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe whistle-blower, who had no firsthand knowledge of the events he described, wrote in his complaint that he spoke to \u201cmultiple U.S. government officials\u201d who said that Mr. Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear whether the White House official he spoke to on July 26 was the second whistle-blower, who has also provided information to Mr. Atkinson, or a different person. Neither whistle-blower\u2019s name has been made public.\n\nLittle, if any, of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint has been disproved, though Mr. Trump has sought to discredit him because his account was secondhand. The White House transcript largely affirmed his account of the call, and Mr. Atkinson deemed his complaint credible, saying he interviewed others who corroborated it.\n\nThe White House official \u201cseemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the national security apparatus about the call,\u201d the C.I.A. officer wrote in his July 26 memo.\n\nMuch of the whistle-blower\u2019s memo also comports with the existing public record of the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. The C.I.A. officer noted that he spoke to the White House official for only a few minutes, \u201cand as a result, I only received highlights.\u201d\n\nThe memo detailed key aspects of the conversation, including Mr. Trump\u2019s request for investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nThis is a developing story.
