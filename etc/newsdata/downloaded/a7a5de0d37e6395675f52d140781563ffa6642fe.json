According to a 2012 survey, about 11 percent of US adults have pain every day and more than 17 percent have severe levels of pain.\n\nOften this leads to dependence on potent painkillers like opioids, or attempting to self-medicate through counterfeit or illicit drugs which are increasingly laced with deadly fentanyl.\n\nBy better understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for pain modulation, researchers hope to eventually find better cures: potentially ones that target only those forms of pain that are \u201cbad\u201d and not useful.\n\n\u201cThe healthy response is you get pain, it tells you something is wrong, it heals, and the pain goes away,\u201d said Carrasquillo.\n\n\u201cIn chronic pain, that doesn\u2019t happen, the system gets stuck. If we can identify what makes the system gets stuck, then we can reverse it.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A new study published in Cell Reports on Tuesday honed in on the brain circuitry responsible for upgrading or downgrading pain signals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/brain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
