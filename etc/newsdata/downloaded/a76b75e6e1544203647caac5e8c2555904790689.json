She was the first of many current and former diplomats and officials who testified behind closed doors to House committees this week \u2014 despite White House orders not to. Hill testified that then-national security adviser John Bolton advised her to tell White House lawyers about all this to protect herself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe accusation at the center of her testimony would be a running theme in the inquiry all week: That Rudolph W. Giuliani (who, remember, is Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and not a government employee) was taking over Ukraine foreign policy from diplomats with decades of experience and politicizing it for Trump\u2019s personal gain.\n\nTUESDAY: Hunter Biden speaks\n\nHunter Biden told ABC News in the only interview he\u2019s given since this story broke that he showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d and wouldn\u2019t serve on any foreign boards if his dad, former vice president Joe Biden, were president, trying to clear the air about his work in Ukraine hours before the Democratic presidential debate. His position on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings ended up not being a major topic at the debate.\n\nAD\n\nGeorge Kent, a former state Department official overseeing Ukraine testified he was worried Hunter Biden\u2019s work could undermine the U.S.\u2019s efforts, led by Biden, to encourage the Ukrainian government to address its own conflict of interest problems. This was in 2015, and Kent said he brought it up to the attention of then Vice President Biden\u2019s office but was turned away by a staffer who said Biden was already overwhelmed by dealing with the terminal illness of his other son, Beau. There is still no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine, but Kent says he was worried about the appearance of it at the time.\n\nWEDNESDAY: A top State official goes to Congress, days after he quit\n\nThis is probably as close to a defection as we have seen in this impeachment inquiry. A former adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told the House investigators that he quit his job just last week over his concerns about the Ukraine allegations and that career diplomats are getting thrown under the bus as it plays out. Michael McKinley worked closely with Pompeo, who is close to Trump, so he could have information about Pompeo\u2019s role in Ukraine, The Post\u2019s Carol Morello and John Hudson reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told his fellow Senate Republicans to get ready for a Senate impeachment trial, maybe around Thanksgiving and lasting until Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile, a fourth person was arrested in a campaign finance case against major Trump donors. More broadly, the case accuses several Giuliani associates of scheming to illegally donate to a congressman as they tried to persuade the congressman to help get the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine ouster. Trump later removed the ambassador, upsetting a number of diplomats who would testify this week against him. \u201cA diplomatic mugging,\u201d a person familiar with McKinley\u2019s testimony called the ousting of Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nWe learned more about Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff\u2019s role in enabling Trump to pressure Ukraine to do his political bidding. The Post reported that Mick Mulvaney gave the order to pause handing over the bipartisan-approved military aid to Ukraine, funds that some diplomats feared were being withheld in a quid pro quo for help on political matters important to Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTHURSDAY: \u2018Get over it\u2019\n\nThursday was probably the most damaging day for Trump\u2019s presidency -- of the week, or maybe ever. In a press briefing at the White House, Mulvaney acknowledged something Trump had been denying: that the administration held up military aid for Ukraine in part because Trump wanted that country to investigate an allegation based on conspiracy theories that Ukraine was behind interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201c[Did] he also mention to me, in the past, that the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d Mulvaney says. \u201cAbsolutely, no question about that. But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money..\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you just described is a quid pro quo,\u201d a reporter says, giving him an opportunity to clarify if it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe do that all the time on foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney answers in a pretty unmistakable affirmation. A few hours of White House panic later, Mulvaney tried to mop things up in a statement, saying the press \u201cmisconstrued\u201d his comments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, one of Trump\u2019s top diplomats working on Ukraine matters, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told Congress he was uncomfortable with how the White House appeared to politicize Ukraine relations and that Giuliani was taking directions to do so from the president himself. That\u2019s despite the fact Sondland comes across in text messages as one of Trump\u2019s top defenders throughout the summer, as he, Giuliani and diplomats negotiated with Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president to score an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nWith more scrutiny about his role working alongside Sondland on Ukraine, Energy Secretary Rick Perry informed Trump he\u2019ll resign by the end of the year. Democrats have subpoenaed Perry for documents about his involvement in that July call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president. Perry acknowledges urging Trump to make the call, but says he was focused on energy issues. He denies that his resignation has anything to do with the Ukraine inquiry.\n\nFRIDAY: More potentially damaging testimony is coming\n\nIt\u2019s clear Trump wasn\u2019t happy with what Mulvaney admitted. \u201cI think he clarified it,\u201d Trump said Friday, describing Mulvaney\u2019s statement.\n\nCongress called for five new witnesses to testify next week, including the acting ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, who is quoted in text messages calling it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "From top aides turning on the Trump administration to acknowledging a quid pro quo, it was the most damaging yet for Trump", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vk0uL5N95UiEDN9-aQLTJgkXOrE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKCUQNHPAII6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
