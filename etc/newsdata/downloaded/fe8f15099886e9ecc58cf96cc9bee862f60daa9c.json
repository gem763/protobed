Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nWith a 1.8% yield and a nine-year payment history, investors probably think Gyldendal looks like a reliable dividend stock. A 1.8% yield is not inspiring, but the longer payment history has some appeal. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Gyldendal!\n\nOB:GYL Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. In the last year, Gyldendal paid out 32% of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Gyldendal paid out 8.1% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservative and suggests the dividend is sustainable. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nWhile the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note Gyldendal's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Gyldendal's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. The first recorded dividend for Gyldendal, in the last decade, was nine years ago. It's good to see that Gyldendal has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. Its most recent annual dividend was kr7.00 per share, effectively flat on its first payment nine years ago.\n\nWe're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments, we don't think this is an attractive combination.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share (EPS) are growing - it's not worth taking the risk on a dividend getting cut, unless you might be rewarded with larger dividends in future. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Gyldendal has grown its earnings per share at 11% per annum over the past five years. A company paying out less than a quarter of its earnings as dividends, and growing earnings at more than 10% per annum, looks to be right in the cusp of its growth phase. At the right price, we might be interested.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Gyldendal ASA (OB:GYL) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f3iajc9aQnBd7Rs6.wDSHQ--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/05f638968181fb8bb531860945706a2b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
