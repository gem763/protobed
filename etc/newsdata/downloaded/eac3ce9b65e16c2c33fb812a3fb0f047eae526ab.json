This explains why our MPs aren\u2019t allowed but Modi welcomes them.\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi, of the Congress party, tweeted: \u201cMPs from Europe are welcome to go on a guided tour of Jammu & (hash)Kashmir while Indian MPs are banned & denied entry. There is something very wrong with that.\u201d", "description": "A group of mostly right-wing MEPs toured Kashmir on Tuesday as India opened up the restive region to a foreign delegation for the first time since withdrawing its semi-autonomous status in early August.
