Hot flashes, mood swings, insomnia \u2014 the long list of symptoms makes it a time of life dreaded by many women. It's also seen as the end of good things.\n\nBut what if we're looking at menopause incorrectly? According to historian Susan Mattern, this is a narrow way to consider an essential life stage.\n\n\"Nature has given us this gift of freedom from fertility, freedom from reproduction and we should absolutely appreciate it,\" Mattern told IDEAS.\n\nIn her book, The Slow Moon Climbs: The History, Science, and Meaning of Menopause, Mattern travels deep into our Paleolithic past and provides new ways of understanding life beyond fertility.\n\nIn fact, she says menopause is key to how our species has evolved and thrived.\n\n\"It's not a mistake, right? It's not a time of life when we live past some test of usefulness or anything like that. This is...how we became human,\" Mattern said.\n\nMenopause as a cultural syndrome\n\nMenopausal syndrome was an idea first advanced by male doctors starting in Europe during the 1700s. But before then, physical complaints around the cessation of periods end of menstruation were not actually a significant part of medical literature during that time \u2014 not even in women's own writings, such as intimate diaries.\n\nMattern says it was the rise of modern Western medicine in the 19th and 20th centuries that is responsible for framing menopause as a deficiency \u2014 \"as some kind of hormonal failure.\"\n\nIn the 1966 bestseller Feminine Forever, Dr. Robert A. Wilson declared menopause to be a crisis of femininity and desirability, best countered with supplemental hormones. Mattern believes that women themselves have been affected by that societally-based idea. But she goes further, calling menopause a cultural syndrome.\n\n'As our bodies respond and we get more worried, we get more anxious. We create symptoms and these can take quite specific forms. They can be quite severe.'\u200b\u200b - Susan Mattern\n\nThe University of Georgia research professor acknowledges that some women suffer extreme symptoms, requiring drugs. But she contends that symptoms such as hot flashes are a mix of mind and body.\n\n\"How a cultural syndrome works...It is a sort of feedback loop between what we think and what we believe and how our bodies respond,\" Mattern explained.\n\n\"And as our bodies respond and we get more worried, we get more anxious. We create symptoms and these can take quite specific forms. They can be quite severe.\"\n\nMattern makes a parallel with panic attacks: located physically, yet amplified with anxiety.\n\n\"We...believe that cognition is a really important part of panic attack, and it can be treated with cognitive behaviour therapy. So I'm saying that menopause has some of that character.\"\n\nMenopause specialist Dr. Wendy Wolfman has not yet read Susan Mattern's new book. But she says that current medical research proves that vaso-motor symptoms \u2014 hot flashes \u2014 are verifiably physiological and they are among the most common, medically-validated symptoms of menopause.\n\n\"We now know the cells in the brain that are responsible...get bigger after menopause. We know that they have connections to the thermo-regulatory centre within the brain,\" said Dr. Wolfman.\n\nStill, could a broader more inclusive assessment of menopause be helpful? Mattern suggests there's ample evidence for menopause as a life stage with benefits for women, and our species as a whole.\n\nThe Grandmother Theory\n\nMattern is convinced by the Grandmother Theory of evolution. It proposes that post-reproductive women in the long hunter-gatherer period of our history led their clans in the gathering of food and knowledge. Menopause, and longer life in humans, evolved in this Paleolithic era period to ensure that ease of more reproduction, better brain development, and group mobility.\n\nIn Flash Count Diary, Darcey Steinke offers a new way to think about menopause with her research and reverence for the female body. She applauds the ascendency, beauty and power of the post-reproductive years. (Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar Straus Giroux)\n\nAnother writer on menopause also points to coming upon the Grandmother Theory as her \"defining moment.\"\n\nDarcey Steinke is behind a genre-defying book called Flash Count Diary: Menopause and the Vindication of Natural Life. Suffering many hot flashes a day, and discouraged by pop cultural misogyny around menopause, Steinke sought greater meaning in her experience.\n\nInspired by the idea of older women as leaders, Steinke also found kinship with killer whales \u2014 one of the only other species to experience a long post-reproductive life.\n\nFascinated with a Pacific orca nicknamed Granny, Steinke calls the mammal matriarch \"a conduit out to the greater world for me.\"\n\n\"That's kind of what menopause is\u2026 You feel a certain way because of hormones, but once that's over there's a strong feeling of ... freedom, in a spiritual sense.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGuests in this episode:", "description": "Is The Change always \u201cwomen\u2019s hell?\u201d Is it possible that the negative way we think about menopause has an effect on how women actually experience menopause?
