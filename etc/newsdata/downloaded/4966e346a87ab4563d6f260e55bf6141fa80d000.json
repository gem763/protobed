Chinese beverage giant Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. and automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. are among the other companies based in the prosperous region that have been singled out, according to reports in state media.\n\n\u201cWe understand this initiative from the Hangzhou city government aims to foster a better business environment in support of Hangzhou-based enterprises. The government representative will function as a bridge to the private sector, and will not interfere with the company\u2019s operations,\u201d Alibaba said in a text statement. Representatives for Wahaha and Geely didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Hangzhou government said the initiative was aimed at smoothing work flow between officials and China\u2019s high-tech companies and manufacturers. But the move could be perceived also as an effort to keep tabs on a non state-owned sector that\u2019s gaining clout as a prime driver of the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. Representatives of the country\u2019s public security system are already embedded within China\u2019s largest internet companies, responsible for crime prevention and stamping out false rumors.\n\nRead more: Chinese Technology Moguls\u2019 Latest Obsession: Red Tourism\n\n\u201cThey might be checking whether the Communist party units are working effectively within the companies,\u201d said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cWhile China legitimized capitalism, the level of government influence was never intended to disappear. Occasionally private entrepreneurs forget about this and are reminded of it.\u201d\n\nZhejiang is considered the cradle of modern Chinese private enterprise, home to a generation of self-made billionaires from Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma and Geely founder Li Shufu to Wahaha\u2019s Zong Qinghou. The Communist Party accepted so-called \u201cred capitalists\u201d or private entrepreneurs into the Party in 2001, allowing them to become part of the country\u2019s legislature a year later.\n\nStill, the relationship between Beijing and well-known business people remains sensitive. The government has been seen to try and step up an official presence within non-state firms, by among other things mandating that private companies of scale set up and maintain a Party branch. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the 100 Zhejiang-based companies included foreign enterprises.\n\nWhy Communist China Is Home to So Many Billionaires: QuickTake", "description": "China Steps Up Government Presence at Alibaba, Private Giants", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic4290bd29d8db6415c7e05193a7434f20.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
