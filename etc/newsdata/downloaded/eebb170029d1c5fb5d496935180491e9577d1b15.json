You need a goalscorer. He is not a natural goalscorer like Ian Wright or Gary Lineker.\n\n\"You have to get in the box if you are a real centre forward.\"\n\nRashford struggled in Sunday's defeat at Newcastle, with Graeme Souness blasting at half-time: \"Is he on the pitch or is he coming on in the second half?\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAnd Merson said he wasn't living up to Lukaku's record in terms of goals.\n\nMerson added: \"You can't sell goals. Lukaku was a goalscorer - he might not chase the full-back down but he puts the ball in the net and that is what it is all about.\"\n\nLifelong United fan Rashford, who has scored three goals this season, apologised to fans after the game , tweeting: \"You can\u2019t hide in football and the last few weeks simply haven\u2019t been good enough.\n\n\"As a United fan myself, that hurts. And you deserve better.\n\n\"We know we need to improve and that is our sole focus as a team and as a club.\"", "description": "Rashford must learn from likes of Ian Wright and Gary Lineker as United struggle for goals", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531562.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League-St-James-Park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
