I\u2019ve come through a really tough section of the draw without playing well.\n\n\u2018I know I need to up my game in the next round if I\u2019m to progress and that\u2019s what I\u2019m working towards now.\u2019\n\nAspinall, Dobey and Durrant are all debutants in the World Grand Prix and will all be playing for a place in the semi-finals on Thursday evening at the Citywest hotel.\n\nUK Open champion Aspinall beat Danny Noppert 3-2 in the last 16, to set up his clash with Chisnall, who comfortably saw off Stephen Bunting 3-0 in the second round.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m proud, relieved, it was a really, really tough game,\u2019 the Asp told Live Darts after beating Noppert.\n\n\u2018I felt it was a battle for both of us, I just battled, like Nathan does, and booked my place in the quarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018All my family are back at my house in Stockport celebrating my daughter\u2019s second birthday and I can\u2019t be there. I\u2019ve had a lot of emotion today because it\u2019s all new to me, this game, being away from home a lot.\n\n\u2018Darts means everything to me but not as much as my daughter. Maybe that;s why I struggled for times because I wanted to win so much for her.\u2019\n\nWorld Grand Prix Quarter-finals Ian White v Chris Dobey\n\nDave Chisnall v Nathan Aspinall\n\nMichael van Gerwen v Mervyn King\n\nGlen Durrant v Jermaine Wattimena\n\nMORE: Chris Dobey aiming big after stunning Gary Anderson at World Grand Prix\n\nMORE: Gerwyn Price sends an emotional message to his supporters after painful World Grand Prix exit", "description": "Michael van Gerwen is the only seeded player left in the World Grand Prix at the quarter-final stage after Rob Cross and Peter Wright crashed out on Wednesday evening.
