At this jungle nursery, hospital and school, staff are dedicated to saving a species. They provide medical treatment and urgent care for sick or injured orangutans and raise orphaned babies whose mothers have been killed.\n\nLocal caregivers become surrogate parents, with round-the-clock care to replicate the intense family bond an orangutan would have with its mother in the wild. They teach their young charges how to forage, socialize and navigate in the forest, a process that can take up to ten years.\n\nEventually, the juvenile orangutans are released back into the wild where they get a second chance at life.\n\nThe centre was originally founded thirty years ago by Birut\u00e9 Galdikas, one of the intrepid primate researchers who is featured in the Nature of Things documentary She Walks with Apes.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/orphange.jpg"}
