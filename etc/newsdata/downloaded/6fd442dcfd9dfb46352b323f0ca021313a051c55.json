This amount is expected to increase, and it is not hard to see why. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare tells us that although a record 15 per cent, or 3.8 million of our population, is 65 or over, this figure is expected to balloon to 12.8 million, or 25 per cent, by the end of the century. We share this phenomenon with others in our global village as the World Health Organisation predicts the number of people over 65 by 2050 will double to 2 billion, or 22 per cent of the world\u2019s population.\n\nThe positive, of course, is that we are all living longer and finding new ways to cure a widening list of ailments and diseases. From an investment perspective, there are other benefits, such as patent protection, government subsidies, regulatory protection, global expansion potential and, of course, inelastic pricing of health goods and services. In other words, given how essential the service is, the supplier can often charge a hefty price for the product.\n\nRisks remain\n\nHowever, there are real risks that investors need to consider. The first may seem ironic \u2013 the healthcare sector is one of our market\u2019s unhealthiest, as more than 80 per cent of all companies on the Australian exchange are exposed to unacceptable levels of financial risks. This is often the result of the binary nature of developing new and novel solutions to tackle health issues. It often takes many years of high-risk product testing, capital raisings and regulatory approvals before commercialisation, let alone any sign of positive cash flow, comes through for many of these businesses. In that time, the company will either have succeeded in its mission or failed \u2013 there is often no middle ground.\n\nAnother factor to consider is healthcare\u2019s role as a political football. This is not just because of the number of voters who use these services and face the pressures of increased living costs, but also because the government contributes more than 40 per cent of the 10 per cent of GDP spent annually on healthcare. Given rising healthcare costs and the significant influential stakeholders involved, the government can undo these businesses with a stroke of a pen.\n\nDue to the consistently high investment in research and development, the few companies that generate positive free cash flow do not pay much in dividends, preferring to reinvest. This makes them unfit for income-seeking investors. Relying on capital growth to pay \"an income\" in this sector can be risky given the volatile nature of share prices.\n\nBut these risks do not offset the investment thesis in our view. If you aim to construct a diversified portfolio of stocks to help ride through the volatility, it is prudent to look at the high-quality stocks in the healthcare sector to help construct the perfect all-weather portfolio.\n\nWe continue to hold the stocks from this all-weather sector in our growth fund. Many are at different stages of their price journey and are being managed to provide the best balance between the objective of capital growth and defensive elements.\n\nGeneral advice only.
