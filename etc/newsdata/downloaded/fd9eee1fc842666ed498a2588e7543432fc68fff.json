Primetime on Sunday night, 570 leading players from around the world will be presented to eight new franchises in the hope of being drafted. Five out of every six players will leave the night disappointed, such is the competition to appear in the tournament.\n\nFor those watching, the focus of the Hundred draft will lie in the razzmatazz of this ostentatiously made-for-TV event. But for those assembling their teams, the focus will lie squarely on building a side to win.\n\nAt a time of increasing financial disparity within European club football, the Hundred has followed Twenty20 leagues around the world in embracing the talent distribution model of US sports leagues: a socialistic structure, designed to ensure competitive balance and on-field parity.\n\nAll teams in the draft have a total of \u00a3960,000 to spend on 14 players - 12 once you discount the two local players per team who have already been allocated in advance of Sunday night - buttressed by their one England Test player and a wildcard pick made just before next year\u2019s competition. So no team will be able to gripe about being outspent by their opponents; they can only lament about being out-thought by them.", "description": "It will be a spectacle unlike anything English sport, never mind English cricket, has ever witnessed before.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Michael Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000211874110-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOnF-pGyuMayIW5_daymjxnTHGlwFGxsgtPsCwrCiByE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
