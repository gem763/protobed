CYCN, -79.35% plummeted 71% toward a record low Wednesday, to pace all premarket losers, after the biopharmaceutical company said a Phase 2 trial of its diabetes treatment missed the primary endpoint. The company said the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of praliciguat, which is a once-daily, orally available stimulator in diabetic nephropathy did not meet statistical significance on its primary endpoint of reduction in albuminuria from baseline as compared with placebo. The company said, however, there was a trend toward improvement and improvements were observed in patients in several secondary measures associated with cardiovascular risk and kidney disease. Cyclerion said it still expects to \"out-license\" praliciguat for global development and commercialization. The stock, which went public in March, has run up 39.2% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, -0.20% has gained 1.0% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.11% has edged up 0.8%.", "description": "Shares of Cyclerion Therapeutics Inc. plummeted 71% toward a record low Wednesday, to pace all premarket losers, after the biopharmaceutical company said a...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
