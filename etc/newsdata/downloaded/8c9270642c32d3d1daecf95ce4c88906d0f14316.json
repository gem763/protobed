It's time to deliver.'\n\nBridenstine added that NASA has programs that have been in development for years.\n\nMusk responded during his Starship reveal that SpaceX resources are overwhelmingly focused on the Dragon crew capsule and the Falcon rocket that will launch it.\n\nSpaceX is developing a capsule under NASA's commercial crew program to launch astronauts to the international space station so that the U.S. does not have to rely on Russian rockets and spacecraft.\n\nDuring Thursday's press conference, Musk said SpaceX was within 1 percent of the commercial crew program budget.\n\nSpaceX employees work on the Crew Dragon spacecraft that will astronauts to and from the International Space Station, from American soil, as part of the agency's commercial crew Program (AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\n\n'The NASA request for commercial crew for several years was substantially reduced by Congress, I think in some cases by 50 percent,' Musk said.\n\n'It's pretty hard to stay on schedule if you've got half as much money, but we didn't spend more money, it just took longer.'\n\nDespite the tensions, both Musk and Birdenstine agreed that Crew Dragon could be ready to take its first-ever human passengers into space by the first quarter of 2020.\n\nBefore it's cleared for launch, however, it must pass critical safety tests including one's on its emergency abort capability.\n\nTests on the craft's safety systems went notoriously awry earlier this year causing the capsule to be engulfed in flames.", "description": "NASA's Jim Bridenstine (left) addressed criticisms of Elon Musk (right) for SpaceX's delayed Crew Dragon spacecraft.
