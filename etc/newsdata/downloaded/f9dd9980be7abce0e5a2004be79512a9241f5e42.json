When it comes to things I have just blindly believed my entire life, this is really up there. It turns out that, contrary to my own belief based on what my Mum told me, it is not illegal to drive with the light on inside the car.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but when I was a surly teenager who read at all hours of the day and night, I was repeatedly reprimanded for putting on the interior light in the car to binge Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t read in the car because it\u2019s illegal to have the light on,\u201d Mum would tell me, flicking it off while I resorted to my iPod and staring out the window emotionally while listening to So Fresh, only the sad songs.\n\nAt the very least, a bunch of US folks know this experience \u2013 so many, in fact, that Buzzfeed wrote an entire article debunking the myth that you can\u2019t legally drive with the interior car light on.\n\nGrowing up I thought it was illegal to turn on this light when my parents were driving pic.twitter.com/6Mluhfpsjz \u2014 ???? (@mooya_chimuka) June 25, 2018\n\nGrowing up my parents made me believe that someone turning a light on in the car while I\u2019m driving was going to be a much bigger issue in my life than it actually is. \u2014 RECO BRASI (@reco_brasi) July 11, 2019\n\ngrowing up I thought it was illegal to switch the light on while the car is driving..I feel used \u2014 Onicka Nghitewa (@onickanghitewa) September 3, 2017\n\nBut I had to know if the same was true for Australia. After all, NSW is known as the Nanny State. We can\u2019t bloody do anything here! Surely it\u2019s illegal Down Under.\n\nNOPE. CarsGuide.com.au came through with the goods, stating it\u2019s absolutely not in legislation that you can\u2019t drive with the interior car light on.\n\nBUT \u2013 there are different stages of having the car lights on that CAN get you booked. According to CarsGuide, the \u201cmap lights\u201d, which they call small circular lights but I\u2019m thinking they mean the ones near the flippy-downy thing (sun visor???) that aren\u2019t as bright, don\u2019t light up the interior of the car as much.\n\nThe big light in the middle though \u2013 the one that goes on if a door is open \u2013 can give bounce-back on the windshield, meaning your vision is more obscured. This can lead to violations of road laws, depending on the po-po.\n\nIf a police officer sees you driving along lit up like Sydney Harbour on New Year\u2019s Eve, they could potentially fine you a few different ways. The way the Australian road laws are written a policeman (or woman) has the power to fine you if they believe you are not in full control of your vehicle, or are driving in a manner they believe to be dangerous to other road users.\n\nBasically, you can get booked for distracted driving, or driving with your vision impaired or obscured, and this all depends on the cop who sees you driving and their judgement call.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s not really safe \u2013 especially if you find you can\u2019t see out the windshield very well. So don\u2019t do it if you can. But no, popping it on at the lights to see if that was a giant spider that just ran across your lap is fine.", "description": "The short answer is yes, you can drive with the interior car light on in Australia.
