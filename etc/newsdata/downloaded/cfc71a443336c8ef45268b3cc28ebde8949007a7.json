In 2018 the company funded 111 members of Congress who voted against climate legislation at least 90 per cent of the time.\u201d\n\nAhead of the worker strike, Google announced \u201cthe biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history\u201d, which included 18 new energy deals that will increase its portfolio of wind and solar agreements by 40 per cent.\n\nThe workers group hopes Google will go further than this by ending all contracts with fossil fuel companies and eliminate funding for climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.\n\n\u201cAs individuals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,\u201d the group stated. \u201cBut if we act together \u2013 if we act now \u2013 we can build a better future.\u201d", "description": "Google has made donations to more than a dozen organisations that deny climate change, according to newly uncovered documents.
