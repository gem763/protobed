(AP) \u2014 Rookie Ja Morant had the best game of his young career and veteran Jae Crowder hit a game-winner to make the Memphis Grizzlies' first victory of the season memorable.\n\nCrowder's 3-pointer from the top of the key as time expired in overtime lifted the Grizzlies to a 134-133 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night.\n\n\"We've been playing well these first two games,\" Crowder said of losses to Miami and Chicago. \"We put five quarters together and came out with a win.\"\n\nThe winning shot was possible after Spencer Dinwiddie split a pair of free throws with 7.4 seconds left, Grizzlies reserve Solomon Hill grabbing the rebound when the second shot was missed.\n\nAfter a Nets foul in the backcourt, Memphis inbounded the ball with 3.7 seconds left. Morant, who led the Grizzlies with 30 points, dribbled behind his back as he crossed half court, then handed out his ninth assist, shuffling a pass to the trailing Crowder for the 28-foot game-winner.\n\n\"I believe in Jae the whole way, and he delivered for us,\" Morant, the second pick in last summer's NBA Draft, said of the winning basket.\n\n\"Anytime you lose at the buzzer, it's always a tough loss,\" Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said.\n\nDillon Brooks scored 21 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Grizzlies. Morant also blocked Kyrie Irving's 17-footer at the end of regulation to keep the score tied at 120-all.\n\nCrowder's winning 3-pointer was his second basket of the game, as he finished with six points. His previous 3-pointer came with 1:09 left as Memphis took its first lead of overtime at 131-128.\n\nIrving finished with 37 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for the Nets. Caris LeVert added 27 points, Dinwiddie had 16 points on 3-for-13 shooting from the field.\n\n\"What a game, huh?\" Grizzlies first-year coach Taylor Jenkins said. \". Obviously, to get our first win of the season it took a complete team effort.\"\n\nMorant led that \"team effort,\" helping Memphis reach overtime by scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter. Morant's layup \u2014 his final points of the period \u2014 tied the score at 120 with 7 seconds left. He blocked Irving on the ensuing possession as time ran out in regulation.\n\n\"I head-faked,\" Irving said. \"I tried to shoot a fade. He's got long arms. He got a good contest on it and blocked the shot.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNets: DeAndre Jordan started for the first time this season, replacing Jarrett Allen, who opened the first two games at center.
