(Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images)\n\nMatt Lieberman, son of former Democratic vice-presidential candidate and senator Joseph I. Lieberman, is running in a special election for a Senate seat in Georgia.\n\nMatt Lieberman (D) announced Thursday that he is seeking to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson (R), who said in August that he would retire at the end of 2019 because of health problems. Lieberman is the first Democrat to reveal his intention to run for Isakson\u2019s seat in next year\u2019s election.\n\nIn a statement on his campaign website, Lieberman said he is running because he is \u201cfed-up with the arrogance and cowardice of the politicians in Washington and the hatred, division, and stalemate that has resulted from our corrupted politics.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when Georgia is a focal point in the national debate over abortion. Georgia this spring passed a ban on abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the law from taking effect Jan. 1 while a legal challenge plays out.\n\nDemocrats face a difficult road to wrest control of the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority, in 2020. In addition to Isakson\u2019s position, 22 GOP-held seats and 12 Democratic-held seats are up for grabs.\n\nGeorgia is among the states with the highest chances of flipping parties next year. As The Washington Post\u2019s Amber Phillips previously reported:\n\nGeorgia is another traditionally Republican state where a star Democratic candidate recently reshaped strategists\u2019 views. Even though she didn\u2019t win, Stacey Abrams\u2019s gubernatorial race revealed the partisan makeup of Georgia, shifting it slightly less red.\n\n[\u2018A rush to judgment\u2019: Joe Lieberman says he sees no reason for Northam to resign]\n\nLieberman, 52, is an entrepreneur who runs a health-care business, helped launch a scholarship program for low-income students and developed an anti-hunger and -homelessness program, according to his campaign website. He is a single father of two daughters, holds a law degree from Yale University and once worked as a teacher.\n\nLieberman vowed on his campaign website to lower drug costs and insurance premiums, combat Georgia\u2019s new law banning abortion after physicians can detect a fetal heartbeat, ban the sale of \u201cweapons of war, like the AR-15\u201d and require universal background checks for people seeking to buy guns.\n\nHis campaign website also took aim at the Supreme Court decision in the 2000 presidential election hading Republican nominee George W. Bush the victory against Democratic nominee Al Gore and his running mate, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.\n\nMatt Lieberman wrote that Democrat Stacey Abrams\u2019s loss to former Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) in the 2018 gubernatorial election was \u201canother questionable election result\u201d and called for a new Voting Rights Act.\n\nLieberman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he expected his father, who was an independent by the end of his career, to serve as an informal adviser to his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether you agreed with him or disagreed with him, everyone respected the integrity he had in public life,\u201d Lieberman told the Journal-Constitution. \u201cIf people were fans of my dad, maybe they\u2019ll give me an extra hearing. And for people who aren\u2019t fans, I want them to remember we\u2019re different people and to hear me out as well. I\u2019m confident they will. That\u2019s all I can ask for.\u201d\n\n[Stacey Abrams chooses building a national voter protection program over running for president in 2020]\n\nIn a video announcing his campaign, Lieberman said politicians in Washington have found \u201ca million ways to do nothing.\u201d Then the camera pivots to his teenage daughters.\n\n\u201cAs a single dad, he\u2019s always been pretty relaxed and patient,\u201d says Willie Lieberman, a student at UCLA.\n\n\u201cBut these days, he\u2019s really worked up over how screwed up everything is in Washington,\u201d Tess Lieberman says.\n\nA Democrat most recently controlled a Senate seat in Georgia in the first few days of 2005, before Zell Miller ceded his seat to Isakson. Miller, who died last year, was a conservative Democrat who backed Bush\u2019s reelection and in his 2003 book, \u201cA National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat,\u201d described the Democratic Party as out of step with the country.\n\nIsakson, 74, was reelected to a third term in 2016. In addition to living with Parkinson\u2019s disease, he was hospitalized in July after a fall in his Washington apartment. He later had surgery to remove a renal cell carcinoma from one of his kidneys.\n\nKemp is likely to appoint a Republican to take Isakson\u2019s seat in 2020 and has created an online portal to solicit applications, which are public. The winner of the no-primary special election will serve the last two years of Isakson\u2019s term.\n\nGeorgia voters will have the chance to choose two senators next fall, as the state\u2019s other senator, Republican David Perdue, is running for a second term. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote for Isakson\u2019s seat, the top two finishers will compete in a runoff election in January 2021.\n\nAbrams has said she will not seek Isakson\u2019s seat.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump wanted to have U.S. forces equipped with bayonets to stop migrants at border, among other ideas, officials say\n\nTrump\u2019s removal would require Republican dissidents. But those who speak out become targets of viral disinformation.\n\nAmber Guyger\u2019s 10-year murder sentence sparks protests and an act of forgiveness\n\nBiden, in fiery remarks, tells Trump: \u2018I\u2019m not going anywhere\u2019", "description": "Matt Lieberman, an entrepreneur and single father, is running to replace Sen.
