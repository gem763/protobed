REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nThe British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) last month gave the airline notice of three days of industrial action in September, in what is the first ever strike by BA pilots.\n\nFollowing the strikes on Sept. 9 and 10, another day of industrial action is scheduled for Sept. 27.\n\nBALPA has said that British Airways (BA) should share more of its profits with its pilots. BA has said the strike action is unjustifiable as its pay offer was fair.\n\nThousands of customers have had to seek alternative travel arrangements, and the airline has come in for criticism over how it handled communications with passengers ahead of the strikes.\n\n\u201cThis strike will have cost the company considerably more than the investment needed to settle this dispute,\u201d BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement on the eve of the strike.\n\n\u201cIt is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, the airline dismissed a new offer by BALPA as an \u201celeventh hour inflated proposal\u201d that was not made in good faith. BALPA had said it would have called off the strikes this week if BA had engaged with the offer.\n\nA spokeswoman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged both sides to end the dispute.\n\nAsked about the strike action, a spokeswoman for British Airways said: \u201cWe remain ready and willing to return to talks with BALPA.\u201d\n\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is investigating the airline after it enraged some travelers by wrongly telling them their flights had been canceled.\n\nThe regulator also reminded the airline to proactively tell customers of their rights. During the strikes, BA must offer the passengers reimbursement for canceled flights, alternate travel arrangements under comparable conditions or a new flight at a later date.", "description": "British Airways pilots began a 48-hour strike on Monday, grounding most of the airline's flights and disrupting thousands of travelers' plans in unprecedented industrial action over a pay dispute.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427741038&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8711K-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
