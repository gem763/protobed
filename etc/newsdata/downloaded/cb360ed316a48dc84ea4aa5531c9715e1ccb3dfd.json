I love Juicy Couture\u2019s velour tracksuits; I probably own 100 of them in every colour.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s my uniform when I\u2019m chilling at home or going to the beach. Anything that doesn\u2019t involve a red carpet.\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that when she goes all out, everyone\u2019s heads will be turned.\n\n\u2018Growing up, I always had my own sense of style,\u2019 Paris said. \u2018I loved being unique and original and coming up with my own trends.\n\nThis dress changed our lives (Picture: Dave Benett/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I love the way Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham dress \u2013 they always look so chic and stylish.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Simple Life star has always been a trend setter.\n\nDoes everyone remember the iconic 21st birthday dress that Kendall Jenner also wore over a decade later?\n\nShe said: \u2018When I go to a party, I love to be glamorous and go all out; I like to sparkle and feel amazing.\n\n\u2018I do have a signature look \u2013 I love pink and I love sparkles.\u2019\n\nParis has been slaying her Halloween looks this year by embodying sexy versions of normal costumes.\n\nOne down, 99 to go (Picture: Arnaldo Magnani/Getty Images)\n\nSexy glittery sailors and schoolgirls seems to be her most popular choices this year.\n\nThe star admitted that her style has developed thanks to her sister Nicky Hilton.\n\n\u2018I have been really influenced by my sister Nicky, whose style has always been the complete opposite of mine,\u2019 the singer-DJ said. \u2018I\u2019ve learned to tone it down a little bit, be a little bit more understated sometimes.\n\n\u2018It depends on the situation; I\u2019m a chameleon. I can show up in a Chanel suit, looking like a businesswoman, but if I\u2019m at a party or Halloween or Burning Man, then I\u2019m going all out.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
