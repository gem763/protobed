They begin their lives as nurse bees, caring for and cleaning up after the queen and feeding the larvae, before moving on to the role of caring for the entire colony.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Researchers say other animals \u2013 such as birds and fish \u2013 have shown the ability to give up sleep in certain circumstances.\n\nBirds, for example, sleep less during their seasonal migrations while some cavefish have evolved to sleep less compared with their counterparts that live in open water habitats.\n\nSome male birds and fruit flies will also sacrifice their sleep to give themselves more time to mate.\n\nThe team say their findings open the door to further research on whether sleep deprivation affects health or cognitive performance.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "It\u2019s not just human parents that feel chronically exhausted due to lack of sleep while looking after their young.\u00a0 Scientists say worker bees also get less sleep when they\u2019re caring for larvae \u2013 even if they\u2019re looking after offspring that are not their own.\u00a0 Certain chemicals produced by the pupae could be causing their carers to be able to function on less sleep, according", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/14/bees-2-rachel-rosen.jpg"}
