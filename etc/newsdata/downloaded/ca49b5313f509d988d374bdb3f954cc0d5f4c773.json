Williams said her son has \u201chad enough of life.\u201d\n\nKANSAS SEES FIRST VAPING-RELATED LUNG ILLNESS DEATH: 'IT IS TIME TO STOP'\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had enough of being in pain with the sores,\u201d Williams, of England, previously told SWNS. \"He just wants to give up, he doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore. What do you do, as a mum?\u201d\n\nSo Williams went public with her plea, and thousands stepped up. Within days, the teen, who was born with epidermolysis bullosa, a group of rare diseases that causes blistering skin that appears in response to minor injury including rubbing, scratching, or even adhesive tape, had letters of support from around the world.\n\n\u201cRhys has not been able to wipe the smile off his face,\u201d Williams told SWNS. \u201cHe\u2019s been so happy.\u201d\n\nANTI-VAXXER WHOSE SON CONTRACTED MEASLES SAYS SHE PLAYED 'RUSSIAN ROULETTE' WITH BOY'S HEALTH\n\nWilliams said her son is carefully reading each message sent to him, so he hasn\u2019t gotten through all of them yet \u2014 and more are arriving each day.\n\n\"It's gone worldwide,\u201d she told SWNS. \u201cHe's been on the telly in Chile. He got a card from Qatar today and loads from America. It's just gone everywhere. I just want to say thank you. That's all I can really say at the moment, I'm so overwhelmed by it all.\"\n\nMost types of epidermolysis bullosa sometimes referred to as \u201cbutterfly skin,\u201d are inherited, according to the Mayo Clinic. There is no cure, although mild forms may improve with age. Treatment typically focuses on caring for blisters and preventing new ones.\n\nSevere forms of epidermolysis bullosa may cause fusion of fingers or toes, or abnormal bending of joints that can occur at the fingers, knees and elbows. Patients may have difficulty passing stool due to blisters, may experience dental problems, are at risk of infection and sepsis, and high risk of skin cancer. Infants with a severe form of the disorder are at an increased risk of death due to loss of body fluids, widespread blistering and issues breathing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWilliams said she got the idea to ask for cards after seeing how well Rhys responded to Christmas cards last year.
