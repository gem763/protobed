Doctors later found the five-year-old had a brain AVM, a rare tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between the arteries and veins. Headaches are a common symptom. Medics believe these vessels ruptured, although they have yet to determine why. When this happens, it causes bleeding in the brain - a stroke. An AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in the brain may not cause any signs or symptoms until the blood vessels rupture, according to the Mayo Clinic. The rare condition strikes around one in 100 people - and is more common in men. The risk of an AVM bursting rises by around two per cent each year. Tafida Raqeeb has been left severely brain damaged, and is hooked up to a life-support machine London's Royal London Hospital. Figures suggest up to 30 per cent of patients whose brain AVM ruptures will suffer permanent brain damage, says the American Stroke Association. It writs on its website: 'Each time blood leaks into the brain, tissue is damaged. This results in loss of normal function, which may be... permanent.'\n\nThe decision was aided after Shelina Begum obtained a fatwa, an Islamic religious ruling, that it was 'impermissible for the parents, or anyone else, to give consent for the removal of the life-supporting machine from their child'.\n\nMr Justice McDonald said that the fatwa was 'a valuable restatement of the sanctity of life, a sanctity recognised by all the great religions and also by those who view life through a secular or scientific prism'.\n\nNow, bosses at the Royal London Hospital, where Tafida is being treated, said they had been considering an appeal but now say they will not try to overturn the decision.\n\nAlistair Chesser, chief medical officer for Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the Royal London Hospital, said: 'We followed the guidance of the General Medical Council and referred this tragic case to the Family Division of the High Court to reach an independent view about Tafida's best interests.'\n\n'The High Court weighed up clinical and ethical considerations and decided, on the balance of evidence, that life-sustaining treatment should continue.'\n\n'After careful consideration regarding the wider implications of the judgment, we have decided not to appeal.'\n\n'Our doctors and nurses will continue to provide Tafida with the best possible care as long as she continues to be our patient.'\n\n'We will also support the family as they make alternative arrangements for Tafida's care.'\n\nHe added: 'This is a difficult situation for everyone involved, and we are grateful to the Judge for his guidance about what is best for Tafida in the unique and unfortunate circumstances set out in his ruling.'\n\nTafida's parents have waged a lengthy fight against Barts doctors to have her transferred from London's Royal London Hospital to Genoa in Italy where doctors will continue treatment\n\nA High Court judge ruled that Tafida Raqeeb can be taken to the Gaslini children\u00b4s hospital in Genoa, Italy\n\nHigh Court officials said the hearing listed before Mr Justice MacDonald would not now be staged.\n\nSpecialists at the Royal London Hospital, where Tafida is receiving life-support, had opposed a move to Italy.\n\nThey said further treatment would be futile because the youngster has permanent brain damage, is in a minimally conscious state and has no chance of recovery.\n\nHowever, Miss Begum has refuted their assessment, saying: 'Tafida actually knows my presence.'\n\n'I'm the one who spends the entire day there, and I'm the one who sees improvements every day.'\n\nLawyers representing Tafida had asked him to rule that she could be moved to Italy.\n\nThey had taken instructions from a relative and their application was backed by Tafida's parents.\n\nMs Begum and Mr Raqeeb said doctors at Gaslini Children's Hospital would keep providing life-support treatment until Tafida was diagnosed as brain-dead.\n\nThey said Tafida, who has a British-Bangladeshi background, is from a Muslim family and Islamic law allows only God to end life.\n\nMr Justice MacDonald, who analysed evidence at a recent High Court trial in London, said he had decided 'on a fine balance' that it was in Tafida's best interests for 'life-sustaining treatment' to continue.\n\nHe said there could be no justification for stopping her parents moving her to the Italian hospital if they wanted to.", "description": "Tafida Raqeeb\u00b4s parents won a High Court battle on Thursday when a judge ruled that the five-year-old (left and inset) should be kept on life support and  could be taken her to Genoa, Italy, for treatment.", "authors": ["John Bennett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/11/19293800-0-image-a-18_1570186632527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
