But this environment throws up opportunities too, even for cautious investors.\n\nJP Morgan Global Core Real Assets has a clunky name \u2013 known more simply as JARA \u2013 but the concept behind it is ideally suited for the times we live in.\n\nSafety route: The JARA fund will invest in Canadian assets such as trains\n\nThe investment trust is floating on the stock market this month at \u00a31 a share and it will invest in more than 500 physical assets, spanning property, infrastructure and transport around the world.\n\nInvestments will include blocks of flats, wind farms, airports, power plants and water distributors.\n\nAround half the assets will come from the US and Canada, another 30 per cent from places in the Asia Pacific region, such as Australia, Japan and Singapore, 15 per cent will be sourced from Europe and just 5 per cent from the UK.\n\nSpreading investments across countries and sectors \u2013 with none accounting for more than a tiny percentage of the whole \u2013 makes JARA more defensive than many stocks.\n\nThis cushion against economic and political volatility is enhanced because JARA will stick to high-quality assets, with solid tenants and predictable, long-term rents.\n\nAs a result, the fund is expected to deliver an annual dividend yield of between 4 and 6 per cent and total yearly returns, including share price growth, of 7 to 9 per cent.\n\nDividends will be paid quarterly and, for the first year, they are likely to be nearer 3 per cent, as JARA builds up its investment portfolio.\n\nBut, by this time next year, the fund should have been able to invest all its cash so the dividend will rise accordingly.\n\nJP Morgan is no newcomer to this field. The firm has been investing in high-quality real assets for more than 40 years and built up a portfolio of property, infrastructure and transport sites, valued at more than \u00a355 billion.\n\nTo date, these investments have been only offered to big, professional investment firms. JARA, however, gives individual investors the chance to participate in this huge pool of assets.\n\nThis has three significant benefits.\n\nFirst, it means that JP Morgan has plenty of experience and should know how to buy safe and solid assets.\n\nSecond, the firm has built up an extensive network so it hears about potential investments early on, often before they are officially up for sale.\n\nThird, much of the money raised in JARA\u2019s forthcoming flotation will be invested in assets that JP Morgan has owned for some time. This adds to the fund\u2019s diversity because its investments will range in age, as well as by sector and region.\n\nThat means the fund can build up its portfolio quickly and start paying out those quarterly dividends.\n\nMidas tips update Michelmersh Brick specialises in premium products, which look better, last longer and cost more than the rest. We tipped it at 71p and shares are now at 95p. Last week, Michelmersh unveiled an 18 per cent rise in first-half profits to \u00a35.2 million and said full-year results would be above expectations. > Read the full Michelmersh Midas share tip update\n\nThe firm\u2019s track record is impressive, with the real asset portfolio delivering historic returns averaging more than 10 per cent annually over the past 15 years.\n\nFor those anxious about the Brexit turmoil, JARA offers some comfort as so little of the fund will be invested in the UK and not that much in Continental Europe.\n\nProviding further reassurance, even though four-fifths of JARA\u2019s cash will be invested directly in real assets, the rest will go into listed property stocks, which can be bought or sold at speed if the need arises.\n\nJARA is hoping to raise at least \u00a3100 million in the forthcoming flotation but it could raise as much as \u00a3500 million, if there is enough demand from investors. Over time, the fund could expand to \u00a31 billion or even more, although there will always be a tight focus on premium assets whose tenants can be relied upon to pay the rent.\n\nShares can be acquired via financial advisors or online, through firms such as AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown and Equiniti.\n\nMidas verdict: In an uncertain world, JARA could prove to be a rewarding, long-term investment, delivering solid annual income and a bit of share price growth too. At \u00a31, the shares look attractive.\n\nTo be traded on: Main market Ticker: JARA JP Morgan JARA website", "description": "JP Morgan Global Core Real Assets has a clunky name - known more simply as JARA - but the concept behind it is ideally suited for the times we live in.", "authors": ["Joanne Hart", "Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
