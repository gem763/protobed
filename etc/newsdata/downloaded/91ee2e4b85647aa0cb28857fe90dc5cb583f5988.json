Harden and Westbrook stayed silent as the media official then asked other reporters for questions.\n\nJames Harden and Russell Westbrook were asked if they would \u201cfeel differently\u201d about speaking on political and societal affairs because of the events with the NBA/China.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson interrupted and informed the reporter that the players would answer basketball questions only. pic.twitter.com/zMe8uWz2hY \u2014 Alykhan Bijani (@Rockets_Insider) October 10, 2019\n\nMacfarlane\u2019s question was spurred by controversy sparked by a tweet posted last weekend by Rockets\u2019 General Manager Daryl Morey expressing his support for democracy protesters in Hong Kong. \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\u201d the brief tweet read.\n\nGovernment officials in China, where the NBA had been growing in popularity, strongly objected. And to the dismay of many U.S. fans and politicians, both Morey and the NBA apologized, with Morey quickly deleting his tweet.\n\nThe treatment of Macfarlane and the thwarting of her question also prompted an NBA apology to her. In a statement, the league said the Rocket\u2019s official \u201cinappropriately interjected to prevent [Macfarlane] from receiving an answer to her question. We\u2019ve apologized to Ms. Macfarlane as this was inconsistent with how the NBA conducts media events.\u201d\n\nDespite the NBA efforts to mollify Chinese officials, the country announced it would stop broadcasting Rockets game and that sponsors would began cutting their contracts with the league.\n\nChina began to embrace the NBA \u2015 and especially the Rockets \u2015 after Yao Ming, a Chinese national, was drafted by the team in 2002 and enjoyed a long career with it. The NBA reportedly makes hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue in China.\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nRockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni also brushed off Macfarlane\u2019s questions at Thursday\u2019s press conference about the NBA\u2019s apology to China, saying he stood behind NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s efforts to defuse the matter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation, it\u2019s very difficult. Adam Silver speaks for the NBA, I work for the NBA, I go with Adam,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to speak about basketball,\u201d he added. \u201cI coach basketball. I\u2019m not a diplomat or around the world.\u201d\n\nDespite the NBA\u2019s deference to China, Silver has maintained that free speech was essential to the rights of NBA players and officials.\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said during a news conference earlier this week. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d\n\nCoach D\u2019Antoni was asked about the situation with the NBA and China. Here is the full exchange.\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, I coach basketball. I\u2019m not a diplomat or around the world. I coach basketball.\u201d #Rockets pic.twitter.com/taeLylEuOu \u2014 Alykhan Bijani (@Rockets_Insider) October 10, 2019", "description": "\"Basketball questions only,\" the official said when stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook were asked about free speech.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f7b42210000b908acc5af.jpeg?cache=bbqlppmncp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
