The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.64% meanwhile, was around 188 pints higher at 26,993, a gain of 0.7% and below its all-time closing high of 27,359.16, also set in July. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.59% was up 52 points or 0.6% at 8,238.\n\nOn Thursday, the Dow DJIA, +0.64% closed 28.42 points, or 0.11%, lower, at 26,805.53, with a decline in shares of Post-it maker 3M weighing on the index.

Of those companies, 78% have beaten analyst expectations.\n\nSee: Intel stock shoots higher but one key number has analysts worried\n\n\u201cWe expect the trend in earnings results to be similar to previous quarters, where consensus reduced estimates into the reporting season, only to be revised higher as the results were out,\u201d J.P. Morgan Cazenove analyst Mislav Matejka wrote. \u201cEPS estimates for the third quarter have now fallen below Q2 2019 delivered EPS. This is way too conservative, in our view.\u201d\n\nSee: Amazon earnings miss is the price of growth, analysts say\n\nInvestors also are closely following developments related to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and the status of U.S. - China trade talks as global economic growth slows.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron blocked the EU\u2019s attempt to delay Brexit for three months, but the European Commission said work on this would \u201ccontinue in the coming days\u201d.\n\nThe U.S. and China have made progress in trade talks and come close to finalizing parts of a phase one deal, CNBC reported Friday, citing the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office.

INTC, +7.39% shares rose 7% after the chip maker raised its outlook for the year on Thursday evening after it posted an increase in third-quarter earnings.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.

VZ, -0.39% stock gained after an earnings beat. The telecommunications giant added new phone subscribers and net income attributable to Verizon was $5.19 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. Quarterly revenue edged up slightly to $32.9 billion from $32.6 billion a year ago.\n\nBoeing Co.\u2019s BA, -1.13% 737 MAX was blamed formally in the Lion Air fatal nose dive into the Java Sea nearly a year ago by Indonesia investigators.\n\nHow are other markets performing?\n\nTreasury yields were little changed on Friday as a lack of fresh developments on Brexit and U.S-China trade drew investors\u2019 attention to next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, where another quarter point rate cut is expected. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.15% was up 0.4 basis point to 1.770%,\n\nOil futures drifted into negative territory Friday, but remained on track for weekly gains as concerns over supply appeared to take over the spotlight from longer-term worries over global economic growth and the outlook for crude demand. West Texas Intermediate crude for December CLZ19, +0.12% on the New York Mercantile Exchange was off 10 cents, or 0.2%, at $56.13 a barrel, but was on track for a 4.4% weekly advance after ending Thursday at a nearly one-month high.\n\nGold futures extended a gain above a key $1,500 price on Friday and looked poised to carve out a fresh near-term settlement high as investors positioned for more easing from global central banks, which could add further support for bullion. December gold GCZ19, +0.21% on Comex gained $9.20, or 0.6%, to $1,514.20 an ounce, which would mark the highest close for the most-active contract since Oct. 4, if it holds, according to FactSet data, following a 0.6% gain for the metal on Thursday.\n\nEuropean stocks edged lower on Friday.
