He remains Boeing's chief executive.\n\nAfter the two fatal crashes, the 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide starting in March. The Times reported that the grounding has cost Boeing at least $8 billion.\n\nA task force with members from the governments of several countries found this month that Boeing did not sufficiently inform regulators about aspects of a new automated system that contributed to the two recent crashes of its 737 Max aircraft.\n\nMuilenburg is expected to testify before Congress next week.\n\nUpdated: 5:25 p.m.", "description": "Boeing has replaced its head of commercial airplanes after two\u00a0fatal 737 Max plane crashes in the past year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/boeing737_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
