Any reprisal attack on Iran by the US or Saudi Arabia, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned, would lead to \u201call-out war\u201d.\n\n\u201cI make a very serious statement about defending our country. I am making a very serious statement that we don\u2019t want to engage in a military confrontation,\u201d Zarif told CNN. \u201cBut we won\u2019t blink to defend our territory.\u201d\n\nAsked about Zarif\u2019s comments, Pompeo sought to defuse the stand-off.\n\n\u201cI was here in an act of diplomacy. While the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war and to fight to the last American, we\u2019re here to build out a coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution to this,\u201d the secretary of state said. \u201cThat\u2019s my mission set, what President Trump certainly wants me to work to achieve, and I hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran sees it the same way. There\u2019s no evidence of that from his statement, but I hope that that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nMultiple reports from the White House have portrayed Trump as extremely reluctant to be drawn into another conflict as he campaigns for reelection while seeking to draw down troop levels in Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nPompeo repeated Trump\u2019s warning that Washington would impose further sanctions on Iran, which is already subject to a US oil and banking embargo, arguing that they were effective in cutting Iranian financing for its regional allies and its missile programme.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s direction to us, to continue to prevent them having the capacity to underwrite Hizbullah, Shia militias in Iraq, their own missile program, all the things that they have done to pose a threat to the world, that\u2019s the mission set with our economic sanctions,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo was speaking after consulting Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the Trump administration\u2019s closest allies in the region, particularly in the wake of Israeli elections that threw Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s political future in question.\n\nHow did oil attack breach Saudi defences and what will happen next? Read more\n\nTrump had made clear that Saudi Arabia would have to take the lead role in any response for Saturday\u2019s attacks. But Saudi officials have made it clear they did not want to trigger a full-scale conflict.\n\nThe Pentagon said the focus of its own response was to explore \u201cpotential ways to look at mitigating future attacks\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision not to retaliate against Iran drew criticism from Republican hawks like the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who said that US inaction \u201cwas clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness\u201d.\n\nMost Trump critics applauded US restraint, claiming that the US had under no obligation to Riyadh, but blamed Trump\u2019s rhetorical bluster and his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran for driving the region to the brink of conflict.\n\n\u201cUS inaction will be perceived as weakness,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy programme at the Brookings Institution. \u201cLet me be clear: I\u2019m not advocating war. The point is that [Trump] engaged in a stupid, unnecessary, incredibly dangerous bluff and the Iranians have called him on it.\u201d", "description": "Mike Pompeo says goal is to \u2018get back on the diplomatic path\u2019 following Trump\u2019s remarks that the US was \u2018locked and loaded\u2019", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a74a964da09a547497850717b462d774573e9192/0_121_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=173eb2f02f2e433c69bbe541daa2fb9d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
