Sitting here to eat fish and chips is like being in a foreign country.\"\n\nAs to questions over how authentic it is, a couple of expat Brits chipped in.\n\nOne told Mirror Money it \"tastes just like in the UK\", while another went futher - saying it \"tastes better than in my hometown\".\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Scott's isn't the first Yorkshire chippy to open in China - with Harry Ramsden's heading to Hong Kong back in 1992.\n\nThe restaurant stayed open for years, long after Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, and was so popular at the start that it ran out of chips on its first day.\n\nSadly, it's now closed, although there are a few places left on the region you can still get a fish supper in the province.\n\nScotts said it has benefited from partnering with international payment firm JGOO, to allow Chinese customers to pay through popular platforms WeChat Pay and Alipay.\n\nRichard Morecroft, director and co-founder of JGOO said: \"China represents a huge opportunity for British businesses, but many have failed to tap into this or even consider it.\"", "description": "While Brits have enjoyed Chinese takeaways for years, now it seems more and more people in China will be looking forward to a Friday \"Yorkshire\"", "authors": ["James Andrews"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article20724529.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_chippie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
