Trump\u2019s initial attempts at self-vindication were childish and pathetic, and were met with the derisive laughter they deserved. His Sharpie stunt fooled no one. (\u201cNo one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\u201d an aide told The Washington Post.) Trump\u2019s willingness to lie to the public even when it was both pointless and obvious was troubling, but not new. It was even a little funny.\n\nDevelopments since than have been more disturbing. Late Friday, NOAA released a statement that sided with Trump against its own professional forecasters. This would not be a problem if Trump, and NOAA, were correct\u2014but they were not, which is perhaps why no NOAA official was willing to sign his or her name to the statement.\n\nOn Saturday, the Post reported that on September 1, within hours of Trump\u2019s misstatement about Alabama, and after the NWS Birmingham tweet, NOAA warned staffers via email not to contradict Trump. Or, to put that another way: NOAA had instructed weather forecasters not to correctly report the weather forecast, for fear of hurting the president\u2019s fragile feelings. Instead, staffers were told to offer no opinion at all, even though their job is to forecast the weather. Today, the Post reported that NOAA\u2019s chief scientist\u2014who is only in the job in an acting capacity\u2014is investigating the press release, which he labeled political.\n\n\u201cThe value of our science is in the complexity of our understanding, our ability to convey that understanding to a wide audience of users of this information, and to establish and sustain the public trust in the truth and legitimacy of that information,\u201d Craig McLean, the scientist, wrote to staff. \u201cUnfortunately, the press release of last Friday violated this trust and violated NOAA\u2019s policies of scientific integrity.\u201d\n\nRead: NOAA politicized the weather report\n\nThe press release wasn\u2019t the only example of undue pressure. The New York Times reports that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire NOAA\u2019s political appointees over the NWS Birmingham tweet. Or, to rephrase again: A Cabinet secretary threatened to fire staffers for providing accurate information to the public. The Times reports that Ross called Acting (of course) NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs and demanded that the agency smooth over the contradiction. When Jacobs objected, Ross threatened firings. Because Ross\u2019s most prominent actions in the administration have been dozing off in meetings and lying about his assets, it\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether the demand actually originated in the White House.\n\nAs some meteorologists pointed out after Trump\u2019s Sharpie misadventure, it\u2019s against the law to spread a counterfeit or altered government weather forecast. The president is unlikely to face prosecution for this; he\u2019s avoided charges for more serious but similarly blatant misdeeds. But that law demonstrates why the Dorian debacle isn\u2019t just fodder for laughter, nor merely a case of the abstract dangers of undermining facts\u2014though it is that, too. Disaster response and management require public officials to quickly and clearly communicate to the public where danger lies and how they should react. It\u2019s often a literal matter of life and death.", "description": "The president\u2019s initial misstatement about the danger Hurricane Dorian posed to Alabama was relatively minor.
