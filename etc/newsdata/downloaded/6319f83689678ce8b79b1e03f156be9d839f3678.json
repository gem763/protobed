REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon /File Photo\n\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) supplier Japan Display Inc (6740.T) aims to seal a revised bailout deal by the end of this month for at least 50 billion yen ($468 million) in vital funding, its new chief executive said on Monday.\n\nMinoru Kikuoka also told Reuters in an interview that liquid crystal display (LCD) screens are drawing renewed market interest, pointing to solid demand for affordable smartphones with low-cost screens.\n\n\u201cWe are close to (raising) 50 billion and I believe we can cement the deal this month,\u201d Kikuoka, who took the helm of the cash-strapped display maker in September, said.\n\nThe deal, if realized, would ease immediate risks of a cash shortfall after Chinese investment firm Harvest Group last month withdrew from the consortium of investors behind the bailout.\n\nJapan Display has said Hong Kong-based Oasis Management still plans to contribute $150-180 million, while a major Japan Display client, which sources said is Apple, intends to invest $200 million.\n\nOrders for LCD screens from a major customer have been \u201cstronger than previously planned,\u201d Kikuoka also said. The comment follows a recent Nikkei Asian Review report that Apple has asked suppliers to increase production of its iPhone 11 models by around 10%.", "description": "Apple Inc supplier Japan Display Inc <6740.T> aims to seal a revised bailout deal by the end of this month for at least 50 billion yen ($468 million) in vital funding, its new chief executive said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437951646&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF96087", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
