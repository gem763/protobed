This is an absurd and dangerous claim.\n\nWhy the commitment to such an endeavor? The New York Times believes that slavery was far more than America\u2019s original sin; \u201cIt is the country\u2019s very origin.\u201d Therefore, they conclude, \u201cout of slavery grew nearly everything that has truly made America exceptional.\u201d Certainly, slavery and the terrible aftermath of Jim Crow segregation have powerfully impacted America and Americans\u2014black Americans most of all\u2014and they still impact us.\n\nAs William Faulkner said, \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d However, The New York Times is engaging in revisionist history of the worst sort. Slavery was not at the very center of the American project from the beginning, and it is not foundational to every aspect of American life. Slavery has never defined the country, and its vision of itself, as it morphed from the \u201ccity on a hill\u201d to the \u201clast best hope of earth.\u201d In fact, America is the first nation in world history not based on race or ethnicity, but on the belief \u201cthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\u201d We are still trying to live out that vision and fulfill that promise. That is why so many people from all around the world still want to come here so badly.\n\nThe Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York observes, \u201cthe basic thrust of the 1619 project is that everything in American history is explained by slavery and race.\u201d One example from The Times: \u201cIf you want to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation.\u201d One can acknowledge, as I do, that every plantation should be viewed as a slave labor camp and still not believe it defined American capitalism, which is the envy of the world and has produced more wealth for more people than any other system ever devised on this planet.\n\nAmerica did not begin in 1619. American civilization developed along the Atlantic seaboard of North America with the Puritans in New England; the Dutch, the British and the Quakers in the middle colonies; and the British and French Huguenots in the South\u2014as well as Native-Americans, Jews, and African-Americans (slave and free) in all three regions. By 1776, a distinct English-speaking civilization had developed in what was to become America. And while it was certainly impacted in terrible ways by the evil of slavery and the racism slavery required, they were not the defining character of this new, unique country. Our American founders envisioned a nation where \u201call men are created equal\u201d\u2014an ideal we are still striving to completely realize today and tomorrow.\n\nEven as Englishmen bound by the blind spots of their time and place in history, these forefathers envisioned a new kind of nation where \u201call men were created equal\u201d and \u201cendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these were Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Even in their time, many of them knew that slavery was wrong. The Declaration\u2019s chief author, Thomas Jefferson, himself a slaveholder, declared in words carved into the marble of the Jefferson Memorial, \u201cGod who gave us life gave us liberty. \u2026 I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that His justice cannot sleep forever. Commerce between master and slave is despotism. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free.\u201d\n\nIn the darkest days of the Civil War, when over 300,000 young American men were sacrificing all their tomorrows to end the evil of slavery, President Lincoln declared, \u201cWe hope that the mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled up by the bondsman\u2019s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword \u2026 the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\u201d\n\nLincoln understood. In his Annual Message to Congress in 1862 he declared, \u201cIn giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free. \u2026 We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.\u201d\n\nYes, slavery and racism have been terrible serpents in our midst from the beginning, but they have never defined who we are. The great American film director Billy Wilder\u2014an Austrian immigrant who fled the Nazis\u2014once said, \u201cYou\u2019re only as good as the best thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Our founders\u2019 vision, proclaimed in 1776 and solidified in 1787, is the best thing any nation has ever done, as we commenced the long journey toward implementing that vision, fulfilling those promises and inspiring much of the world to follow our lead.\n\nThat vision of \u201call men are created equal\u201d has inspired untold millions from around the globe for more than two centuries, including a former slave, Frederick Douglass, the descendants of former slaves, such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Justice Clarence Thomas, and multitudes of people of all ethnicities to make America truly the \u201cland of the free and the home of the brave.\u201d John C. Calhoun, George Wallace, and Lester Maddox are in America\u2019s rearview mirror. Millions of us, Anglo-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, and African-American, will never abandon our pursuit of the full realization of Dr. King\u2019s dream of a country, and a world, where we are \u201cnot judged by the color of our skin but by the content of our character.\u201d\n\nWhile we are informed by the ghosts that haunt our history, never let us be distracted from our ultimate goal of fully achieving the American dream.\n\nDr. Richard Land is president of Southern Evangelical Seminary, serves on President Donald Trump\u2019s faith advisory board, and wrote his Princeton thesis on the subject of slavery in America (1840-1865).", "description": "The New York Times\u2019 \u201c1619 Project\u201d asserts that slavery has .09/02/2019 20:03:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Richard Land", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/294/3ca5e6a7-070b-450c-a1ec-55ed382cb345.jpg"}
