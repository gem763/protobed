Since then, on-screen brother and sister, Cox and Schwimmer, created posts designed to welcome the Rachel Green actress to the platform.\n\nCox, who played Monica Geller, took to her own Instagram to share a photo of her and Aniston hugging.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON SAYS A \u2018PAINFULLY WORDED\u2019 CRITICISM AT AGE 11 GAVE HER A VOICE\n\n\u201cHi Jen!\u201d she captioned the image. \u201cWelcome to the social media world\u2026it sucks. You\u2019re gonna love it!\u201d\n\nWhile the line may sound like a jab at social media, it is actually a quote from the very first episode of \u201cFriends\u201d in which her character welcomes Aniston\u2019s to the \u201creal world.\u201d\n\nSchwimmer, who played Ross Geller, shared a photo of his own. It features what appears to be Lego versions of his and Aniston's characters at the famous, fictional Central Perk coffee shop where a lot of the series took place.\n\n\u201cHi Jen! x,\u201d he captioned the snap.\n\nThe \u201cFriends\u201d gang are no strangers to off-camera reunions. Earlier this week, Aniston admitted that they still hang out all the time. Appearing on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" she said she had dinner with \"the whole gang\" over the weekend.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON BASHES MARVEL: I'M NOT INTERESTED IN 'LIVING IN A GREEN SCREEN'\n\n\"We just had dinner on Saturday. Yeah, the whole gang, everyone was there. [David] Schwimmer was in town and we all happened to have a window of time so we all got together,\" Aniston said.\n\nShe added: \"We laughed so hard.\"\n\nUnfortunately for fans of the beloved sitcom, the cast getting back together likely doesn\u2019t mean that the show will be returning in any form. The series\u2019 co-creators recently dashed all hopes while speaking at the Tribeca TV Festival.\n\n\u201cWe will not be doing a reunion show, we will not be doing a reboot,\" co-creator and executive producer Marta Kauffman said, according to Deadline.\n\n\"The show was about that time in life when friends are your family,\u201d she added.\n\nShe reasoned that a continuation of the series is \"not going to beat what we did.\u201d\n\nCo-creator and executive producer David Crane agreed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe did the show we wanted to do. We got it right, and we put a bow on it,\" he added.\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky and Jessica Napoli contributed to this report.", "description": "After making her Instagram debut on Tuesday, Jennifer Aniston\u2019s \u201cFriends\u201d castmates are welcoming her to the world of social media with some nostalgia for the 90s sitcom.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/friends-cast-getty-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
