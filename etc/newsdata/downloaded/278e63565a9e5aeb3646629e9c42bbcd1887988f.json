And that\u2019s what we\u2019re sticking with.\n\n\"You can look for the ACLU to look for a lawsuit, you can look for the freedom of speech people to file a lawsuit,\" Spangler said. \"They\u2019re all around.\u201d\n\nFritts delivered the sermon in his role as pastor at a tiny local church in front of about 15 parishioners, and also recorded it on a video later reviewed by Knox News. He referenced his law enforcement position multiple times during the sermon.\n\nSpangler: 'People are upset ... I'm upset'\n\n\u201cObviously, people are upset, and they should be upset,\u201d Spangler said. \u201cLike I just said, I\u2019m upset. What people say in their pulpit and what they say personally and their beliefs, that\u2019s on them. And a lot of people will either agree or disagree and I think you have a lot of people disagreeing with some of the things said. I can understand that, absolutely.\u201d\n\nSpangler issued a statement Wednesday saying Fritts is on paid sick leave until the buyout takes effect July 19. Spangler told Knox News on Friday that Fritts will have a doctor's note.\n\nIn 2018, Fritts made an annual salary of $49,032.10, according to the Knox News salary database.\n\nFritts filled out paperwork May 15 to be included in the buyout offer, according to Knox County Finance Director Chris Caldwell, who is administering the program. A copy of the application, provided to Knox News by the county, shows a time stamp of 9:27 a.m. May 15. The buyout program was approved by the County Commission in April and offered to all county employees.\n\nCLOSE Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler speaks on the controversy surrounding Detective Grayson Fritts at a pre-scheduled campaign event Friday, June 14, 2019. Calvin Mattheis, calvin.mattheis@knoxnews.com\n\nSpangler said there is no documentation that shows when Fritts' application was approved because it was a verbal agreement, similar to agreements with other KCSO employees.\n\nFritts\u2019 buyout does not affect his county pension, which he will be eligible for once he turns 50, County Retirement and Pension Board Executive Director Kim Bennett said. He will not receive a full pension because he did not work 25 years as required by the Uniformed Officers Pension Plan.\n\nStill, Fritts should receive at least $1,275.28 a month, according to the formula Bennett provided with data from the Knox News salary database.\n\nKCSO spokeswoman Kimberly Glenn said Spangler's acceptance of Fritts' buyout had nothing to do with the sermon and ensuing controversy.\n\nSpangler said he knows there will be critics of his decision to allow Fritts to take the buyout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position to where whatever we do is not going to be good for anybody, you know, it\u2019s just the way it is,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/14/detective-grayson-fritts-knox-county-sheriff-retirement/1460590001/", "description": "Knox County deputy Grayson Fritts can take a voluntary buyout, Sheriff Tom Spangler says, because Spangler fears a lawsuit from the ACLU.", "authors": ["Tyler Whetstone", "Published P.M.
