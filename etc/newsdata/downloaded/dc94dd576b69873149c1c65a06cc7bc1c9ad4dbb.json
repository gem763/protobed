And again. And again. Now, it\u2019s bulletproof.", "language": "en", "text": "The group had gathered on Saturday at noon in the remote spot near Glendora, Miss., to dedicate yet another memorial to Till. And this time, it was bulletproof.\n\nIt took 50 years to get the first memorial to Till erected in Tallahatchie County, the site of the lynching that helped spark the civil rights movement. But then, an entirely new battle began: keeping the tribute intact.\n\nAD\n\nSaturday\u2019s dedication unveiled the fourth marker the local Emmett Till Memorial Commission had installed at the site since 2008, when the original sign was stolen and never recovered. A sheriff suspected it had been thrown into the river, not far from the Graball Landing site where historians say Till\u2019s body had been found.\n\nAD\n\nThe sign and similar markers in the region have become a frequent target for racist vandalism and theft, with perpetrators going to deliberate lengths to deface Till\u2019s memory.\n\nThe commission quickly erected a second sign at Graball Landing, which stood until 2016. By the time it was taken down by the advocates that year, it had been riddled with bullet holes for years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is not just driving down the highway and you see a sign and shoot it,\u201d said Patrick Weems, director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s a very remote site that you\u2019re not just regularly passing by. \u2026 Unfortunately, we have people who go all the way out of the way to vandalize it.\u201d\n\nBut the same week the Ole Miss photo emerged, the Lite Brite Neon Studio in Brooklyn had completed a new sign for the riverside memorial, and the commission was able to install it this month.\n\nAD\n\nThe sign comes with protective glass and reinforced steel to prevent bullet holes, vandalism and theft, Weems said, and for the first time, the site would be monitored by surveillance cameras capable of transmitting feeds over the Internet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to be resilient to putting these markers up,\u201d Weems told The Post. \u201cAnd hopefully, this will be the last marker we have to dedicate for the site.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 1955, Till was a 14-year-old visiting Mississippi from his native Chicago when men kidnapped him at his relative\u2019s home after he spoke to a white woman at a grocery store and was accused of flirting with her. The woman, Carolyn Bryant, recanted significant parts of her accusations decades later.\n\nAD\n\nHer husband, Roy Bryant, and John William Milam, the white men accused of murdering Till, were swiftly acquitted by an all-white jury. In 1956, the pair admitted to killing Till in an interview with Look magazine.\n\nEmmett\u2019s mother, Mamie Till, insisted her son receive an open-casket funeral in Chicago so that the world could see what had happened to him. Till\u2019s murder and the heartbreaking images of his funeral were a major catalyst of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe new, glossy black sign, which weighs 500 pounds, is inscribed with a history of the site, from its clearing by enslaved people in 1840 until the present day, when it continued to be the site of racist attacks on Till\u2019s memorial.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSigns erected here have been stolen, thrown in the river, shot, removed, replaced, and shot again,\u201d the monument reads. \u201cThe history of vandalism and activism centered on this site led Emmett Till Memorial Center founder Jerome Little to observe that Graball Landing was both a beacon of racial progress and a trenchant reminder of the progress yet to be made.\u201d\n\nHistorian Dave Tell, who wrote the inscription on the sign, said it was important to remind visitors of racism\u2019s past and its very real present. He had also led the creation of an app that guided visitors to locations in the county that played an integral role in Till\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone on the commission sees the bulletproof sign as a cure-all,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn some ways, it just feels like a bigger target. Personally, I would not be surprised to see it vandalized again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cby drawing attention to the vandalism at the place, I\u2019m trying to say the vandalism and the bullet holes are part of Till\u2019s story, too,\u201d Tell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to brush that story under the rug.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "It was the fourth memorial on the site, after others had been vandalized.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tYhnD4gpEokMRm5yz6UY4OoG8gk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3SXLHGCGDNGQFJ3S4VA53HGEMU.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
