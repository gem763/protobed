Crews published seven in as many years beginning in 1968 and had a dedicated following that would only grow. When John Ed\u2019s first novel\u2014the sterling debut Tupelo Nights\u2014was published in 1988, Crews reviewed it for The Washington Post and gave it a rave and you better believe John Ed has never forgotten it because it really was a dream review.\n\nWhen I saw that Ted Geltner\u2019s new biography, Blood, Bone, and Marrow\u2014the first proper Crews biography\u2014was reviewed by Dwight Garner in the The New York Times, my sense of excitement was interrupted by the fear that he wouldn\u2019t like it. Or worse, that he\u2019d trash it. But that\u2019s not really Garner\u2019s way\u2014his instinct is to find the good in things; he\u2019s a natural enthusiast who enjoys sharing his enthusiasms. He wants to hip you to what he\u2019s into.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise that he\u2019s a Harry Crews fan or that he gave Geltner the kind of dream review Crews once gave John Ed. I read Geltner\u2019s book, enjoyed it a good deal, and it got me to thinking about nothing but Harry Crews for a few days. Turns out, Stacks alum Steve Oney\u2014whose seminal piece on the lynching of Leo Frank previously appeared in this space\u2014wrote a feature on Crews for the Atlanta Journal & Constitution Magazine in the late \u201970s entitled, \u201cHarry Crews is a stomp-down hard-core moralist.\u201d It is reprinted here with the author\u2019s permission. Please enjoy a rip-roaring glimpse into the cracked beauty that was Harry Crews.", "description": "He wrote novels about sideshow freaks, gospel singers, and midgets.
