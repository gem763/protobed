CORRECTED-PRECIOUS-Gold set for weekly loss as dollar firms on safe-haven bid\n\n(Corrects spelling of brokerage name in 3rd paragraph, and\n\nmetadata in last paragraph)\n\n* Spot gold may test support at $1,488 per ounce/oz -techs\n\n* Dollar at more than three-week high\n\n\n\nBy Diptendu Lahiri\n\nSept 27 (Reuters) - Gold prices were little changed on\n\nFriday, but the metal was on track for a third weekly fall in\n\nfour as a strong dollar offset positive impacts of political and\n\ntrade worries.\n\nSpot gold was steady at $1,506.43 per ounce, as of\n\n0426 GMT, declining 0.7% for the week after a near 2% gain last\n\nweek. U.S. gold futures GCv1 were 0.1% lower at $1,513.7 per\n\nounce.\n\n\"Gold is smack bang in the middle of its longer-term\n\n$1,480.00 to $1,530.00 range,\" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said\n\nin a note.\n\n\"It looks set to remain anchored there for the session as\n\nmarkets await more big picture clarity.\"\n\nThe greenback held near multi-week highs against major\n\ncurrencies as heightened risks from political tensions to the\n\nSino-U.S. trade war increased its safe-haven appeal. Asian\n\nshares were on course for a second straight weekly loss.\n\nMKTS/GLOB\n\nA whistle-blower report released on Thursday said U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump not only abused his office in attempting\n\nto solicit Ukraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for\n\nhis political benefit, but that the White House tried to \"lock\n\ndown\" evidence about that conduct. This added to the uncertainties around the global growth\n\noutlook amid a prolonged U.S.-China trade spat.\n\n\"Gold prices are steady this morning even though there are a\n\nlot of (supportive) news flowing around,\" said Margaret Yang\n\nYan, a market analyst at CMC Markets, adding that the dollar's\n\nstrength capped the upside.\n\n\"If the global economic situation does not improve, we may\n\nsee central banks around the world cutting down interest rates.\"\n\nMeanwhile, investors were cautious on mixed signals from\n\nChina and the United States on their tariff dispute, which has\n\nhelped the bullion gain about 17% so far this year.\n\nChina's top diplomat said on Thursday Beijing was willing to\n\nbuy more U.S. products, and that talks would yield results if\n\nboth sides \"take more enthusiastic measures\" to show goodwill\n\nand reduce \"pessimistic language.\" But reports saying Washington is unlikely to allow American\n\nfirms to supply China's Huawei Technologies HWT.UL undermined\n\nhopes of a complete deal between the countries.\n\nSpot gold may test a support at $1,488 per ounce, a break\n\nbelow which could cause a fall towards $1,446, according to\n\nWang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy\n\ntechnicals.\n\nElsewhere, silver rose 0.2% to $17.83 an ounce,\n\nplatinum XPT= was up 0.2% at $931.75 and palladium XPD= was\n\nsteady at $1,668.28.\n\n\n\n", "description": "CORRECTED-PRECIOUS-Gold set for weekly loss as dollar firms on safe-haven bid", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1G0BT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
