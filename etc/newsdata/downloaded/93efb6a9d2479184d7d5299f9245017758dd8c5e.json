Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the data to come in at 50.2 for September, down slightly from 50.4 in August.\n\nThat followed the release of the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which was 49.8 in September \u2014 slightly exceeding the 49.5 that analysts polled by Reuters had expected. The official PMI data came in at 49.5 in August.\n\nPMI readings above 50 indicate expansion, while those below that level signal contraction.\n\nThe official PMI survey typically polls a large proportion of big businesses and state-owned enterprises. The Caixin indicator features a bigger mix of small- and medium-sized firms.\n\nCedric Chehab, global head of country risk at Fitch Solutions, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" that the latest official PMI reading \"continues to show that the Chinese economy is going through both a structural and a cyclical slowdown, particularly in the manufacturing sector which is being hit by various headwinds,\"\n\nChallenges faced by the country's manufacturers include a tightening of financing conditions domestically and the U.S.-China trade war, he added.\n\nThe PMI is a survey of how businesses view the operating environment. Such data offer a first glimpse into what's happening in an economy, as they are usually among the first major economic indicators released each month.\n\nThe China PMI is closely watched by global investors for signs of trouble amid a domestic economic slowdown and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\n\u2014 This is breaking news.
