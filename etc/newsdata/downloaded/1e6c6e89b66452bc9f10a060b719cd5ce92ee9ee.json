But now she\u2019s charged with her murder.", "language": "en", "text": "But behind the scenes, authorities say now, the truth was worse than what Turner claimed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOlivia was never terminally ill, authorities say, and she wasn\u2019t dying of intestinal failure.\n\nTurner, they say, was killing her.\n\nOn Monday, the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced that Turner, 41, has been charged with first-degree murder, fraud and theft after allegedly inventing her daughter\u2019s illness for years before finally leaving her to die. According to the 13-count indictment first obtained by Denver\u2019s KUSA, in the weeks before Olivia died at age 7, Turner placed her daughter in hospice care and insisted that her health and quality of life were so poor that she should be withdrawn from all medical treatment and her feeding tube, and finally be allowed to die peacefully under a \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d order.\n\nAD\n\nNow, after nearly a dozen doctors cast doubt on the circumstances of the girl\u2019s illness and death, Turner is accused of \u201cbenefiting\u201d from attention from the news media and charities as Olivia\u2019s heart-wrenching story traveled around the country, and as donations poured in online. Meanwhile, authorities say, Turner was allegedly abusing both Olivia and the girl\u2019s older sister as they underwent unnecessary medical procedures based on Turner\u2019s falsely reported symptoms and medical history.\n\nAD\n\nTurner invented the older girl\u2019s ailments too \u2014 a second alleged ruse that would bring Olivia\u2019s death into sharper focus. Olivia\u2019s exact cause of death is not specified in the indictment.\n\nDescribing the case as \u201cextremely emotional,\u201d Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock said Turner was arrested at a hotel in Glendale, Colo., on Friday morning and is being held without bond. It was not immediately clear whether she had an attorney. Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, where Olivia had been treated, has declined to comment, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAD\n\nTurner allegedly began perpetuating the fatal sham in 2011, when she started posting about her daughters\u2019 medical woes on her personal blog. Olivia, she wrote, had a misshapen head and a vascular malformation in her brain, causing her to have seizures, KUSA reported. Her other daughter had \u201costeomyelitis,\u201d a bone infection, Turner wrote. She claimed the family moved to Colorado from Texas to seek better medical treatment, leaving her husband behind.\n\nAD\n\nBut as time wore on, the girls\u2019 predicaments grew increasingly dire. For Olivia, it came to a head in July 2015, when Turner claimed Olivia\u2019s recovery was nearly hopeless.\n\nIn her GoFundMe campaign created that month, she said Olivia \u201cadded a new diagnosis to her already long list.\u201d Now, in addition to a tumor, developmental delays, seizures, autism, sensory processing disorder, focal cortical dysplasia, digestive issues and hydrocephalus, Turner wrote, Olivia now had \u201cneurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy.\u201d She defined it as a \u201cdegenerative mitochondrial disorder that causes the entire body to shut down a system at a time.\u201d It would lead, \u201ceventually,\u201d to her death.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a story about a sweet little princess that everyone has grown to love,\u201d Turner began in her plea on the GoFundMe page.\n\nAD\n\nTwo years later, Olivia\u2019s story was all over TV, as she lived out her bucket list in her final months. There she was riding shotgun in a police cruiser. Hosing down a fire from a firetruck tower ladder. Saving Disney princesses from villains while dressed up as \u201cBat Princess,\u201d as part of the Make-A-Wish Foundation surprise.\n\n\u201cYou could give me all the money in the world,\u201d Turner told KUSA the day Olivia became an honorary firefighter, \u201cand I\u2019ll give it back to you to be able to watch this again.\u201d\n\nOlivia died in hospice care on Aug. 20, 2017, allegedly of \u201cintestinal failure\u201d as her mother claimed at the time \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t until 2018 when authorities began a thorough investigation.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s when Turner brought her older daughter to see a new physician, claiming the girl had survived cancer and undergone chemotherapy.\n\nAD\n\nThe physician, phoning doctors in Texas, quickly realized that never happened, KUSA reported.\n\nThe Jefferson County Human Services Department began investigating, starting with the doctors. They said they never believed Olivia was suffering a terminal illness.\n\nIn fact, the 11 doctors interviewed by investigators doubted many of the other alleged symptoms, too. One doctor said that she could find no evidence Olivia was having seizures, yet had to warn Turner three separate times to stop giving Olivia anti-seizure medication that could cause serious side effects, the Denver Post reported, citing the human services report. One, noticing Olivia was a social and active 6-year-old, questioned how she had ever been diagnosed with autism. And another said Olivia \u201cdid not exhibit the symptoms Turner described most of the time.\u201d But Turner repeatedly ignored doctors\u2019 advice and recommendations, the report found.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother doctor, Robert Kramer, told investigators he was \u201cshocked\u201d upon learning Olivia had died in hospice care and that Turner insisted on withdrawing medical treatment. He had never diagnosed Olivia \u201cwith any of the diseases that Turner wrote about in the GoFundMe page,\u201d according to the human services report.\n\nIn November 2018, Olivia\u2019s remains were exhumed for reexamination. The Arapahoe County Coroner\u2019s Office found nothing to support Turner\u2019s insistence that she died of intestinal failure, the Denver Post reported, but listed her cause of death as undetermined.\n\nCase workers also dug up scores of Turner\u2019s blog and Facebook posts, her GoFundMe updates and numerous interviews with outlets as high-profile as ABC News \u2014 and began to piece together Turner\u2019s alleged motivations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is a concern that [Turner] may have been benefiting from this attention and motivated some of the medical treatment [Turner] sought for both [daughter\u2019s name] and [daughter\u2019s name],\u201d the redacted report said, according to the Denver Post.\n\nAD\n\nTurner is the most recent mother to be accused or convicted of inventing false medical history and symptoms for her children. In other cases, some mothers have been suspected of having Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which an adult fabricates a child\u2019s illness for sympathy and attention. In Clauddine \u201cDee Dee\u201d Blanchard\u2019s case, she claimed for years that her daughter, Gypsy Rose, suffered from a host of mental and physical ailments, including childhood leukemia and muscular dystrophy \u2014 eventually driving Gypsy Rose to enlist her online boyfriend to murder her mother in 2015.\n\nTurner, it seems, was aware of cases like these.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the indictment, she was the first one to bring up Munchausen syndrome by proxy in interviews with the police.\n\n\u201cThat has never been my case, like at all, whatsoever,\u201d Turner told the detective, referring to Munchausen syndrome by proxy, according to the Denver Post. \u201cYou can ask anybody that stood by my side through [redacted] and all of this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe denied all wrongdoing in Olivia\u2019s case, before eventually admitting to inventing claims about the older girl\u2019s cancer, investigators say. KUSA reported she is 11, although it\u2019s unclear where she is now located. Turner is charged with one count of child abuse in the older girl\u2019s case, in addition to charges of defrauding Medicaid of more than $538,000, GoFundMe donors of $22,700 and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of more than $11,000 because of the false medical claims and stories, among other things.\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, a Make-A-Wish spokesman said the foundation is \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the allegations, adding that a referral from the child\u2019s medical team is part of the foundation\u2019s procedures for granting wishes.", "description": "Kelly Renee Turner said her 6-year-old daughter was dying of a rare degenerative disease.
