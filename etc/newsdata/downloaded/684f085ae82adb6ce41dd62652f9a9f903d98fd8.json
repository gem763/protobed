You do not and cannot control what others think or feel.\n\nYou can only control how you think. Shutterstock\n\nThank god, am I right? Thank god you don't have to be accountable for how your mom thinks and feels. Or your boss. Or your unstable coworker. You don't have any control of your spouse's emotions. Even your kids' thoughts are not your responsibility.\n\nYou want people to behave a certain way and you may even try to persuade them to think one way, but here's the lesson: The only thing you can control is how you think. Your thoughts determine your entire experience of every single situation.\n\nOne of my clients tells the story of having a really hostile boss in her middle management days. This boss had a reputation for corporate backstabbing and political coercion. My client saw examples of this behavior, but felt fortunate that they had maintained a relatively peaceful relationship ... until one fateful day when in the presence of the boss' leadership team, my client's reporting indicated risk within her project (read: her boss was ultimately responsible). Once they were alone, the boss began berating my client. She hammered at every mistake my client had ever made and questioned every decision she'd made on her reporting and the work that led up to it.\n\nIs it my client's responsibility for her boss feeling angry? No, certainly not. This example is powerful because the boss is so clearly the antagonist. You may even feel some degree of defensiveness for my client.\n\nNow, let's consider the alternative: What if the boss was kind and supportive? What if my client's analysis was faulty? What if my client had insinuated or outright accused her boss of negligence? Would she be responsible for her boss' feelings? No. Regardless of precipitating circumstances, each of us is only ever responsible for our own feelings.", "description": "This executive coach works with high-performing female executives.
