We continue to offer our technicians industry leading pay and employment terms.\"\n\nIn its legal action, the CEPU, representing 18 technicians, alleges Telstra engaged in unlawful discrimination by targeting technicians on the AWAs over those without them.\n\nThe union also alleges Telstra took unlawful adverse action against the workers because they exercised their workplace right to total remuneration.\n\nThe union wants the telco to restore the incentive plan and pay the workers compensation for their losses.\n\nThe matter is listed for mention in the Federal Circuit Court on December 2.", "description": "Telstra faces legal action for unilaterally terminating bonus incentives for 150 technicians on individual statutory agreements that has cut their pay by up to $80,000.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_79/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6f5d5f552054b0863ecb13d1a521dff75459f9d0", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
