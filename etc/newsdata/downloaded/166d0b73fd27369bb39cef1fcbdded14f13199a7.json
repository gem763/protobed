He was noncommittal on whether he would order U.S. military retaliation.\n\nAt a news conference, Saudi military spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki said the attack Saturday that did heavy damage to the heart of the Saudi oil industry was \u201claunched from the north and was unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\u201d Yemen is south of Saudi Arabia, while Iran and Iraq lie to the north.\n\nAl-Malki stopped short of accusing Iran of actually firing the weapons itself or launching them from Iranian territory.\n\nYemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was in response to the Saudi-led war in Yemen that has killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nAt the news conference, the Saudis displayed broken and burned drones and pieces of a cruise missile that Al-Malki identified as Iranian weapons collected after the attack. He also played surveillance video that he said showed a drone coming in from the north.\n\nEighteen drones and seven cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Al-Malki said, with three missiles failing to make their targets. He said the cruise missiles had a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), meaning they could not have been fired from inside Yemen.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and the Iranian IRGC are using against the civilian object and facilities infrastructure,\u201d Al-Malki said, referring to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard. He added: \u201cThis attack did not originate from Yemen, despite Iran\u2019s best effort to make it appear so.\u201d\n\nPompeo, who landed in Saudi Arabia shortly after the news conference, took a harder line, telling reporters: \u201cThe Saudis were the nation that was attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly.\u201d\n\nHe said en route to Saudi Arabia that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether the Houthis claim they were behind the attack. \u201cThis was an Iranian attack,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fingerprints of the ayatollah as having put at risk the global energy supply,\u201d Pompeo said, referring to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomenei.\n\nThe attack came after a summer of heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. over Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nIran sent a note to the U.S. via Swiss diplomats Monday, reiterating that Tehran denies involvement in the aerial attack, the country\u2019s state-run IRNA news agency reported. The Swiss have looked after American interests in Iran for decades.\n\n\u201cIf any action takes place against Iran, the action will be faced by Iran\u2019s answer immediately,\u201d IRNA quoted the note as saying. It added that Iran\u2019s response wouldn\u2019t be limited to the source of the threat.\n\nThe U.S. State Department had no comment on the warning.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, tweeted: \u201cI have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!\u201d\n\nHe did not elaborate, and it was not immediately clear what further means are available since he has already cut deeply into Iran\u2019s oil market. National Security Council officials declined to comment.\n\nIRNA also reported that Iran\u2019s delegation to the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting has yet to receive the necessary U.S. visas. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to travel to New York on Friday, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani following on Monday.\n\nThe U.N. meeting had been considered as an opportunity for direct talks between Rouhani and Trump.\n\nAsked in Los Angeles whether Rouhani will come to New York, Trump said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. If it was up to me, I\u2019d let them come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt the United Nations is very important,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s got tremendous potential. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever lived up to the potential it has. But I would certainly not want to keep people out if they want to come.\u201d\n\nAs the host of the U.N.\u2019s headquarters, the U.S. is required to offer world leaders and diplomats visas to attend meetings. But as tensions have risen, the U.S. has put increasing restrictions on Iranians like Zarif.\n\nIn Tehran, Rouhani told his Cabinet that Saudi Arabia should see the weekend attack as a warning to end its war in Yemen, where it has fought the Houthi rebels since 2015 and sought to restore the internationally recognized government.\n\nRouhani said Yemenis \u201cdid not hit hospitals, they did not hit schools or the Sanaa bazaar,\u201d referring to the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s airstrikes.\n\nHe said the Houthis were responsible for the attack on the oil installations: \u201cThey attacked an industrial center to warn you. Learn the lesson from the warning.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGambrell and Batrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
