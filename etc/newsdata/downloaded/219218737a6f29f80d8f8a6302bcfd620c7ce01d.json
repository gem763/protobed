Chile has woken up and there is no going back.\n\nWhether in the protests or stuck in one of the petrol station or supermarket queues that have sprung up across cities, people here have largely got behind those who have been calling for change.\n\n\"We need to share a piece of the pie with everyone and have a better Chile,\" said Luis Serrano as he sat in a long queue outside a petrol station in the east of the capital, Santiago.\n\nImage caption With only a handful of petrol stations and supermarkets open, long queues have been forming\n\n\"We need to make this country better because it's in our hands.\"\n\nPresidential apology\n\nBy Tuesday night, it seemed that President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era had finally taken the demands into account.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption President Pi\u00f1era went on national television on Tuesday to apologise\n\nHe started off by apologising on national television and announced some concessions including higher wages and an increase in pensions, as well as higher taxes for the rich.\n\nIt was an about-turn from Sunday when he had declared the country was at war.\n\nThe measures he proposed had been a long time coming but whether they will be enough to empty the streets of protesters is unclear.\n\nChileans' anger towards the political elite is palpable and there are still calls for President Pi\u00f1era to resign.\n\n\"Chile has lots of money but it's totally unfair,\" Nicole Contreras told me through tears. \"My family is middle class and they've busted their backsides, all by themselves.\"\n\nShe added that it was not hard to fix the problem: \"The politicians are the ones who are stealing.\"\n\nHistory repeating itself\n\nThis wave of protests may have been kickstarted by a rise in the price of metro tickets, but the resentment goes back further than that, says Claudia Sanhueza.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Soldiers have been deployed to quell the protests\n\nThe director of the Centre for Economics and social Policy at the University Mayor singles out 2006 as a crucial year.\n\nThat was when high-school students protested against the country's education system in a series of demonstrations known as the Penguin Revolution in reference to the black and white uniform the students wore.\n\nThen in 2011, it was the turn of the university students to call for change.\n\n\"The political elite made an agreement but didn't include their [students'] thoughts and the agreement didn't respond to their demands,\" says Ms Sanhueza.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption A protester holds up a sign asking \"Better times?\"\n\n\"From that time on, there have been a lot of protests and the political elite doesn't listen.\"\n\nShe says more players including social movements and non-governmental organisations need to be invited to help resolve this crisis and social problems in general. Limiting discussion to the political elite is no longer the way to do politics.\n\nThat is a feeling echoed by many. On Tuesday, President Pi\u00f1era invited opposition parties to discuss the protests but not every party accepted.\n\nImage caption Opposition politician Giorgio Jackson did not attend the meeting the president called\n\n\"Every time they have done this, they postpone the demands, every time,\" says opposition politician Giorgio Jackson of the Democratic Revolution Party.\n\nHe said he wanted to avoid an empty photo opportunity. Instead, his party handed a letter suggesting proposals.\n\nSoldiers on the streets\n\nWhile Mr Pi\u00f1era has announced new measures to calm the situation, for now, the soldiers remain on the streets. They are outside supermarkets, on street corners, driving down the street in tanks and watching the protests.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Graffiti on a wall in Santiago proclaims: \"We're not at war #we're not afraid\"\n\nIn a country where military rule ended less than 30 years ago, that makes people nervous, even for those protestors too young to remember it.\n\nNicol\u00e1s Lecaros is a medical student who on Tuesday came down to Plaza Italia, one of the protest hotspots in Santiago, with his fellow doctors to lend a hand.\n\nHe said he could not sit by and study while people were on the streets so he wanted to help in the best way he knew how, by offering medical help to any protester who got into trouble.\n\nImage caption Nicol\u00e1s Lecaros says he could not stand by and watch\n\n\"I haven't lived through something like this before so it's very shocking for us [young Chileans],\" he said of the soldiers on the streets. \"I hear my parents [talk about it], who have lived through it and they have a very big feeling of fear. It's not normal, it's the biggest crisis we have ever experienced.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption A protesters holds up a sign demanding the withdrawal of soldiers\n\nHe says he is not scared though. \"The protesters are giving us courage to keep doing this, so I practically forget the fear I had before.\"\n\nThat fearlessness is obvious - the protesters are not staying silent. But will President Pi\u00f1era's peace offering be enough to quell this anger?\n\nChileans will wake up on Wednesday and decide.", "description": "President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has done an about-turn but will it be enough to sway demonstrators?", "authors": ["Katy Watson", "Bbc South America Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ACFB/production/_109338244_9e0dd6d7-eb74-4d51-84d1-73a30ec64980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
