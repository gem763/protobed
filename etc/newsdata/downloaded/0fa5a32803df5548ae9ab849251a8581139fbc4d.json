But given the NFL\u2019s recent history on the issue, many people are skeptical of the move.\n\nMany high-profile commentators criticized the initiative as hypocritical, accusing the league of blackballing Colin Kaepernick for leading peaceful protests against social justice issues by kneeling during the national anthem at NFL games in 2016.\n\nThat same year, Kaepernick\u2019s organization Know Your Rights Camp began hosting camps for young people and teaching communities about their legal rights in police encounters. In January 2018, the activist announced he completed his pledge of donating $1 million to organizations helping underserved communities.\n\nHe has remained unsigned by an NFL team since he became a free agent after the 2016 season.\n\nRoc Nation said proceeds from the Inspire Change apparel line will support organizations that are focused on the league\u2019s efforts to address social justice issues, such as education and economic empowerment, police and community relations, and criminal justice reform, according to a press release.\n\nSimilarly, as part of the related music initiative called Songs of the Season, select artists will create music that will be used in NFL promotions. The songs will \u201cdebut during an in-game broadcast and will be simultaneously released to all digital streaming platforms worldwide.\u201d All proceeds from the songs will go toward Inspire Change.\n\nCarolina Panthers safety Eric Reid, who was the first NFL player to kneel in protest alongside Kaepernick, has been a vocal critic of Roc Nation\u2019s partnership with the league.\n\nHe mocked the new initiative in a Twitter post on Friday.\n\n\u2033\u2018Let\u2019s diffuse the uprising of Black voices demanding justice with concerts to \u201cinspire change\u201d that have nothing at all to do with real \u201caction,\u201d\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201d\u2018It\u2019s cool because our token black guy set up the concert.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s diffuse the uprising of Black voices demanding justice with concerts to \u201cinspire change\u201d that have nothing at all to do with real \u201caction\u201d. It\u2019s cool because our token black guy set up the concert\u201d \u2014 Eric Reid (@E_Reid35) August 30, 2019\n\nKaepernick shared on Twitter Friday a highlighted paragraph from Robert L. Allen\u2019s 1969 book \u201cBlack Awakening in Capitalist America\u201d that discusses the role of capitalism in the oppression of Black communities.\n\n\u2033Reading always gives me clarity,\u201d Kaepernick wrote.\n\nHe then shared the following quote from the book: \u201cWhat [they] seek is not an end to oppression, but the transfer of the oppressive apparatus into their own hands.\u201d\n\nReading always gives me clarity.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat [they] seek is not an end to oppression, but the transfer of the oppressive apparatus into their own hands. \u201c\n\n\n\nRobert L.

They will perform a free concert in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park ahead of the NFL\u2019s kickoff game featuring the Chicago Bears against the Green Bay Packers on Sept. 5.\n\nOther Twitter users joined Reid in criticizing the recent announcement:\n\nPeak NFL is blackballing someone for speaking up for racial injustice and then turning that shit into a t-shirt. Whew chile, the ghetto. \u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) August 30, 2019\n\nHow do we stop racism, systematic oppression, and police brutality?Jay-Z and the NFL: Let\u2019s sell t-shirts and throw concerts. That\u2019ll really shake up the system. \u2014 Chris Williamson (@CWilliamson44) August 30, 2019\n\nJay-Z and the NFL are partnering to profit off of \u201csocial justice\u201d clothing.\n\n\n\nI remember when Kaepernick donated his sneaker collection to homeless folks all over the Bay Area. I remember when he donated suits to former prisoners at Rikers, so they had clothes for job interviews. pic.twitter.com/TnoVWVIHIS \u2014 L E F T, PhD (@LeftSentThis) August 30, 2019\n\nThe NFL is now profiting off of what Colin Kaepernick started while simultaneously blackballing him. https://t.co/ma7xOml9B3 \u2014 Steven Ruiz (@theStevenRuiz) August 30, 2019\n\nThe \u201cInspire Change\u201d tagline is telling. Jay-Z and the @NFL\u2014with all of its power and billions of dollars\u2014don\u2019t seem to want to actually create any social change themselves. They just want to take the cause Kaepernick and others kneeled to illuminate, ban him, and profit. https://t.co/KRUDpPKbYe \u2014 Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) August 30, 2019\n\nI keep reading the NFL and Jay-Z announcement about their plans for Initiate Change but I struggle to interpret it as anything other than making a soundtrack and selling clothes to fix social injustice. That can\u2019t be right, can it? I wanna be wrong, because that plan is weird. \u2014 Dugar, Michael-Shawn (@MikeDugar) August 30, 2019", "description": "Colin Kaepernick tweeted about capitalism and the oppression of Black people hours after the new program was announced.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6abde42400009d0071c34f.jpeg?cache=blz55k2m05&ops=1778_1000"}
