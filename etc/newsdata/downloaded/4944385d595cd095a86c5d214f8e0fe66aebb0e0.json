Some claim it was on this day in 1920 the Communist Party of India (CPI) was constituted in Tashkent, now the capital of Uzbekistan, though the CPI (which split in 1964 to give birth to the CPM) records its foundation day as December 26, 1925. Whether the first communist party in the country is 94 or 99 is immaterial; what matters is that the Reds in the country are terminally ill. And that\u2019s not good.\n\nMost of the communist parties across the world have taken either of two paths. The successful ones \u2014 and there haven\u2019t been many that remained successful for long \u2014 have been through trials before triumph, reverses before revolution. Once they overthrew oppressive regimes and established \u2018dictatorship of the proletariat\u2019, they became as tyrannical as their erstwhile rulers. The unsuccessful ones fell by the wayside, much before this Orwellian transition.\n\nIn India, they took a third path. Having reconciled with parliamentary democracy \u2014 which they valiantly called \u2018revolution through the ballot\u2019 \u2013 the Indian Left led by the CPM attained power in three states \u2014 Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura. In Kerala, where the first communist government, led by EMS Namboodiripad came to power in 1957, the first big revolution was the land reform (though the act came into force only in 1969 under the C Achutha Menon government).\n\nThe government snatched \u2014 literally \u2014land from feudal lords and passed it on to toilers. This, along with the education reforms \u2014 which also hit the wealthy groups that ran institutions \u2014 proved to be the nemesis of the first EMS government as the Catholic church, the Indian Union Muslim League and the Nair Service Society fuelled the \u2018vimochana samaram\u2019 (liberation struggle) that ended with the Centre dismissing the government.\n\nWest Bengal followed in the footsteps of Kerala, launching Operation Barga a year after they came to power in 1977 and backing up the land reform movement with a legislation in 1979. So far, so good. It may sound simplistic, but the longer the Left remained in uninterrupted power, the more arrogant they turned.\n\nWhile power in Kerala alternated between the Left Democratic Front and the Congress-led United Democratic Front, the long march of the Reds in West Bengal lasted 34 years. As the leaders turned Big Brother, the party, now a machinery and a master, lost touch with the masses \u2014 and reality. The collapse of the Soviet Union accentuated this decadence.\n\nBut the comrades didn\u2019t give up their march to oblivion. Their new slogan: The Left is always right. This theory is further endorsed by the fact that wherever the party has not been in power, like in the Cauvery delta of Tamil Nadu, there is still goodwill for what is left of the Left.\n\nThis goodwill \u2014 however feeble and fleeting it may be \u2014 makes a section of people hope against hope for a resuscitation of the Reds. The Economist cover on February 14 (The rise of millennial socialism) discussed how socialism (that\u2019s not quite communism, but that debate can wait) is back in fashion. \u201cSocialism is storming back,\u201d read the story on the \u2018resurgent Left\u2019, \u201cbecause it has formed an incisive critique of what has gone wrong in Western societies. Whereas politicians on the right have all too often given up the battle of ideas and retreated towards chauvinism and nostalgia, the Left has focused on inequality, the environment, and how to vest power in citizens rather than elites.\u201d\n\nMuch of what The Economist said of the right in the Western world is true of India too, only that the Left seems to be marching to oblivion", "description": "Past Thursday, 98-year-old CPM leader N Sankaraiah hoisted a red flag in Chennai to celebrate something a year older to him: The Indian Communist Party.
