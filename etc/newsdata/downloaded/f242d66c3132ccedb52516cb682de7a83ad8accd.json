But there\u2019s much more.\n\nMore than anything else, the Chinese Communist government seeks control of its own people, Hong Kong, and a widening region of Asia and beyond. That puts major American interests at risk.\n\nHONG KONG PROTEST ESCALATION: TEAR GAS, WATER CANNONS AND A POLICE OFFICER FIRING A WARNING SHOT\n\nHong Kong, which is about the size of New York City, is one of the world\u2019s leading financial centers. For many years it was a British colony, but in 1997 Britain transferred authority to China on condition that China would preserve key democratic institutions for 50 years.\n\nLess than halfway through that period, China is on the verge of crushing Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms. If China succeeds in doing that without paying a heavy price, the results will make all of Asia far more dangerous.\n\nThe United States absolutely does not want war with China. That means we don\u2019t want to encourage Chinese officials to take actions that make the world less stable and less safe. Americans should understand that the fate of Hong Kong is part of a larger strategic picture in which we have a lot at risk.\n\nThe Hong Kong crisis arises from the increasingly aggressive authoritarianism of China\u2019s President Xi Jinping. He is driving the Chinese Communist Party to tighten control over Chinese society, commerce and information.\n\nXi has made the Chinese government far more oppressive domestically and far more aggressive abroad. As a result, political instability inside China is increasing; public protests are increasingly large and numerous.\n\nMeanwhile, China has been boldly pushing its neighbors around, sinking their fishing vessels, destroying their infrastructure, and conducting subversive political operations within their countries.\n\nHong Kong is now the site of the largest protests in modern Chinese history. If they continue, the Chinese government has two choices.\n\nChina can back down and allow the people of Hong Kong to retain their freedoms, as it promised to do for at least another 28 years. Or it can crush the Hong Kongers. Given President Xi\u2019s record, there is reason to fear the worst.\n\nChina has the power to use force to end the Hong Kong protests. No outside power will prevent that, and America will not and should not go to war over Hong Kong.\n\nBut what if the world does nothing? What will Asian security look like if Chinese leaders think they can take such violent action without any penalty?\n\nChina\u2019s political, diplomatic, economic, and military moves all suggest it is becoming more expansionist. If it pays no price for crushing Hong Kong, China might decide it can afford to use force to also take control of Taiwan.\n\nA weak response to Chinese aggression against Hong Kong could make Chinese officials think they could move against Taiwan without facing serious consequences. This would be explosive.\n\nWith 24 million people, Taiwan is bigger than Florida. Since 1949, its government has been free from the Chinese Communist government in Beijing.\n\nTaiwan has remained free because China has been deterred from using military power against it. The key ingredient to the deterrent has been the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan defend itself.\n\nA weak response to Chinese aggression against Hong Kong could make Chinese officials think they could move against Taiwan without facing serious consequences. This would be explosive.\n\nThe U.S. is committed in law to the policy of aiding Taiwan\u2019s defense. We supply arms to Taiwan and U.S. officials have warned for decades that China must not try to change Taiwan\u2019s status by force.\n\nIf China attacked Taiwan, all of Asia would worry about where Chinese military power would strike next.\n\nOur allies in South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Thailand would question the integrity of U.S. security pledges and rightly fear for their safety. Few scenarios would be more dangerous to world peace.\n\nBeyond the issues of Hong Kong and Taiwan, China is now conducting a vast \u201cdebt-trap\u201d foreign policy designed to increase its control of countries throughout the developing world.\n\nChina is providing trillions of dollars in loans to countries that are unlikely to be able to repay them. The resulting defaults will increase China\u2019s control of vital infrastructure in Asia, Africa, and even Latin America.\n\nThe United States has many common interests with China. We want China\u2019s help with sanctions against the North Korean nuclear weapons program, for example. When I was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations we got that help, imposing the toughest international sanctions ever against North Korea.\n\nThose sanctions are leverage that President Trump is using in direct talks with the North Koreans that we hope will end their nuclear threat.\n\nPresident Trump is also right to demand better trade terms from the Chinese. That fight was always going to be tough, but it\u2019s one that was long overdue.\n\nHowever, the reality is that China\u2019s leaders are committed to an ideology that cares a whole lot more about preserving and expanding their own Communist regime than about trade terms or North Korean nuclear weapons.\n\nChina might be willing to make concessions in the trade talks in return for some kind of U.S. \u201cgreen light\u201d to crush Hong Kong. But giving such a green light would be a dangerous mistake.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThough the U.S. cannot prevent China from suppressing the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement by force, it would be crucial that we impose substantial costs on China for doing so. That is what\u2019s needed to preserve deterrence for Taiwan, and to preserve peace with China.\n\nPresident Trump wisely invoked the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre recently when talking about the impact that a Chinese attack on Hong Kong would have on U.S.-Chinese relations.\n\nIf China attacks Hong Kong, then business as usual with China must come to an end. The surer the Chinese are of that result, the less likely they are to attack, and the less risk there will be of military confrontation down the road.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA Chinese attack on the Hong Kong protesters would show the world what China is really all about. It would show the developing countries that China is an unsafe partner. It would show China\u2019s trade partners it cannot be trusted.\n\nIn addition, such a Chinese attack would show the world once again the stark difference between how free counties and dictatorships operate. And that\u2019s why Hong Kong matters.", "description": "If China crushes protests in Hong Kong it might attack Taiwan and other U.S.allies in Asia next.", "authors": ["Nikki Haley"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/26/694940094001_6077314187001_6077312140001-vs.jpg"}
