Whether people voted Leave or Remain, they did not vote to shut down democracy.\u201d\n\nIt came on a night of high drama as hundreds of anti-government and anti-Brexit protesters cheered on calls for a general election at a rally in Parliament Square outside Westminster.\n\nCrowds also applauded speakers criticizing austerity policies who addressed them from a small stage erected in the square.\n\nProtesters carried placards bearing anti-Boris Johnson and anti-Brexit slogans, such as \u201cTories Out,\u201d \u201cNo to Boris Johnson\u201d and \u201cStop Brexit!\u201d\n\nChants of \u201cBoris out\u201d also echoed around the square next to the Houses of Parliament.", "description": "Conservative members of Parliament on Tuesday risked their careers to form a \"rebel alliance\" and take the Brexit timetable out of the party leader's hands.", "authors": ["Politics News Reporter", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ec61d2500005500021b35.jpeg?cache=fyhdfaaib5&ops=1778_1000"}
