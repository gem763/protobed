Her fans did not want to see her supporting animal abuse,\" campaign spokeswoman Kristin Leigh said.\n\n\"Whilst the reason being used by the racing industry is a scheduling mix up, it appears to us that she has responded to those calls.\"", "description": "Swift had been due to sing at the Melbourne Cup, a move criticised by animal rights activists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B3F5/production/_108896064_gettyimages-1170404760-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
