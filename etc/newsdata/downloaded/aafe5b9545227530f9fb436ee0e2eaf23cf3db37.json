It was his only year under future Hall of Fame manager Bobby Cox and the Atlanta Braves \u2014 but the lessons the Nationals manager learned then remain.\n\n\u201cHe was the same guy I worked for every day,\u201d Martinez said Monday of the steady Cox.\n\nThat one-day-at-a-time approach has brought Martinez and his Nationals, after a rocky season start, to Tuesday night\u2019s winner-take-all wild card game at Nationals Park with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe survivor earns a trip to Los Angeles to face the Dodgers Thursday in the five-game National League Division Series.\n\nIt\u2019s the first wild card appearance for Washington, which won four National League East division titles from 2012-17, and the Nationals come into the contest as a testament to the sometimes corny logic of Martinez, who told his team, after the slow start, to focus on going 1-0 every day.\n\n\u201cIt has won us a lot of games this year,\u201d general manager Mike Rizzo said of his manager\u2019s one-at-a-time philosophy.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of managers try to approach it like that, the 1-0 mentality,\u201d reliever Daniel Hudson told The Washington Times. \u201cBut it is the first time it resonated with me, for some reason.\u201d\n\nHudson broke into the majors in 2009 with the Chicago White Sox and last appeared in the playoffs in 2011 with the Arizona Diamondbacks. Now he is part of a team that was 19-31 in late May, but ended the year with eight straight wins.\n\n\u201cWe celebrate each win,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cBut as soon as we finish celebrating we start thinking about tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTomorrow for the Nationals arrives Tuesday at 8:08 p.m., with ace right-hander Max Scherzer (11-7, 2.92) taking the mound in front of a home crowd.\n\n\u201c(Scherzer) loves the spotlight,\u201d Nationals pitching coach Paul Menhart said. \u201cHe relishes it. It is a testament to his huge heart and fight.\u201d\n\nScherzer allowed just one earned run in six innings on May 6 at Milwaukee in a game the Brewers won, 5-3. In his career against Milwaukee, Scherzer is 2-2 with 2.29 ERA in nine games, with eight starts.\n\nBrewers slugger Ryan Braun is 0-for-14 against Scherzer and fellow outfielder Lorenzo Cain is 0-for-15. Cain (left ankle) said Monday he is not sure if he will be able to play. Braun is dealing with a sore calf muscle, but manager Craig Counsell said he will be in the lineup.\n\nThe Brewers will be without National League batting champion Christian Yelich, who missed the last few weeks of the season after he fouled a ball off his kneecap.\n\n\u201c(The Brewers) are a good team,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey can beat you in many ways.\u201d\n\nScherzer will be opposed by Brewers right-handed starter Brandon Woodruff (11-3, 3.62). The 26-year-old from Mississippi is 2-0, 0.96 in four games, with two starts, in his career against Washington.\n\nWoodruff made one start against the Nationals this season, allowing just one run and four hits in six innings at home May 8.\n\nThe Brewers will be ready to use their bullpen while Washington is prepared to use top starters Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin out of the bullpen if need be.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much bigger than this,\u201d Brewers pitcher Brent Suter said of the one-game duel. \u201cIt makes you live in the moment.\u201d\n\nNationals shortstop Trea Turner said the season-long fight to climb back into postseason contention made the team tougher.\n\n\u201cYou have to come to the field every single day and battle and I think we did that,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThe full body of work has been impressive.\u201d\n\nTurner credits a veteran club, including Ryan Zimmerman, Kurt Suzuki and Howie Kendrick.\n\n\u201cNo panic in the team,\u201d Turner said.\n\nWashington reliever Tanner Rainey said members of the bullpen will be ready from the first inning on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWords can\u2019t really describe it,\u201d Rainey said of the season. \u201cEspecially where we were in May. There are no words for it.\u201d\n\nMartinez has the same approach for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI am ready to go 1-0,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
