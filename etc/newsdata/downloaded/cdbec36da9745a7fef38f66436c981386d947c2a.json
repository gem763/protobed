That's \u00a36,400 cheaper than the petrol V8 version but still a lot of money.\n\nTrue, the hybrid with its 3.0 litre V6 petrol engine doesn't have the gnarling grunt of its more powerful siblings.\n\nBut for everyday driving around town it's a delight.\n\nFor keeping up with the Joneses on the school run, lunch trips into town, or family holidays, it's fine.\n\nIt looked very much the part as I drove it around upscale Atherton, which has the most expensive postal or zip code in the USA.\n\nThink of it as San Francisco's version of Esher in Surrey, Alderley Edge in the North West, or Morningside in Edinburgh.\n\nThe hybrid is powered by a new 340PS TFSI petrol engine - with a twin-scroll turbo-charger inside the 'V' - linked to a 94kW 128PS electric motor.\n\nMan on a mission: The hybrid is powered by a new 340PS TFSI petrol engine - with a twin-scroll turbo-charger inside the 'V' - linked to a 94kW 128PS electric motor\n\nTogether the total petrol-electric hybrid power reaches 449PS \u2013 equivalent to four Ford Fiestas but a notch below the V8's 550PS. Top speed is a more than adequate 158mph with 0 to 60mph acceleration in 5.2 seconds. That compares 4.0 seconds for the W12 Bentayga, and 4.4 seconds for the V8 Bentayga.\n\nFor the record, the 4.0 litre 8-cylinder 435PS Bentayga Diesel that this replaces would accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 4.6 seconds and go on up to a top speed of 168mph.\n\nDriving around, the hybrid feels as effortless as a Bentley should and - power aside \u2013 it's little different from a conventional Bentayga, with the traditional hand-crafted luxurious interior.\n\nSo here's the science. Under way on the road, the electric motor doubles up as an electric generator.\n\nThere are four driving modes: the default Bentley setting for all-round driving; Sport for a more engaging drive which I enjoyed most; Comfort for chilling or being chauffeured; and Custom, which you can tailor for yourself. There's also permanent four-wheel drive technology.\n\nSpoiled for choice: There are four driving modes: the default Bentley setting; Sport for a more engaging drive; Comfort for chilling; and Custom, which you can tailor for yourself\n\nBut the automatic 'Start-Stop' switch is replaced with a control for three so-called E Modes.\n\nEV mode is for driving in electric-only power and is designed for short runs and city journeys with emission-free driving. A dynamic acceleration pedal is activated in EV drive, so the driver can apply a level of pressure below that which will cause the combustion engine to kick-in.\n\nBentley says it will go in electric only at speeds of up to 85mph\n\nHowever, I couldn't get anywhere near 85mph in purely electric power before the petrol engine kicked in, and I wasn't alone.\n\nHybrid mode is for medium to long-range journeys when the vehicle's on board management system switches between the petrol engine, the electric motor, or a combination of the two, depending on the driving.\n\nFast forward: There's the usual suite of safety, parking and comfort aids including: adaptive cruise control and traffic assist\n\nHowever, it's not available in Sport mode.\n\nHold mode preserves the battery charge by using mainly the petrol engine.\n\nBut an extra boost for the electric motor is available on demand when the driver presses hard-down on the accelerator. It is selected automatically when the driver selects Sport mode, as the power from both the engine and the electric motor combine to provide 'the most spirited driving experience'.\n\nFair enough. It does.\n\nThere's the usual suite of safety, parking and comfort aids including: adaptive cruise control and traffic assist which allow the driver to keep a comfortable time gap to the vehicle in front; traffic sign recognition; infra-red electronic night vision; and head-up display.\n\nYou won't be looking to do any serious off-roading other than perhaps mounting the kerb from time to time. And it will really stand out among the ranks of wall-to-wall electric Teslas, in the electric car ranks. Plug-in car charging can be controlled in person via the on-board charging point or remotely from a smartphone using an app.\n\nThere was a big debate internally at Bentley as to how far the hybrid, in its styling at least, should be differentiated from the pure petrol version. An early motor show prototype highlighted the words 'hybrid' on the side of the vehicle, and the 'Bs' on each of the wheels, in a subtle copper tone \u2013 to reflect electric wiring. But in the end they decided to stick to plain chrome making the hybrid virtually indistinguishable from the V8 and W12 versions Personally, I think that's a shame. If you've gone for a hybrid, it would be nice to get some of the kudos for at least dipping a toe towards being greener.\n\nCutting edge: The arrival of the hybrid comes as Bentley has ditched its first - and last - diesel\n\nSo only the eagle-eyed may notice the hybrid tag or that the socket for the charger is hidden on the opposite side to the fuel filler cap.\n\nThe arrival of the hybrid comes as Bentley has ditched its first - and last - diesel. The very last V8 diesel Bentaygas rolled off the line in around March, said executives.\n\nThat too is a shame. But that's business. The diesel was a remarkably clever bit of engineering developed to provide a more frugal performance. But it was doomed by bad timing. For by the time it was launched with great fanfare in late 2016, diesel had a bad smell.\n\nThe dieselgate scandal afflicting Bentley's German parent company Volkswagen and other sibling brands such as Audi, was one factor.\n\nBut this was exacerbated by politicians and ministers who, having urged motorists to buy diesels to save the planet, because of their emissions of CO2 blamed for global warning, then did a U-turn to say the particulates in NOx in diesel was harmful so started demonising diesel.\n\nSo, within two years and amid a massive management change, Bentley in October had dropped its V8 diesel in the UK and Europe citing a widely documented shift in political and legislative conditions and 'a significant shift in attitude towards diesel-powered cars'.\n\nBentley reckons the 168-cell lithium-ion battery can be charged fully charged in just 2.5 hours using a fast-charger, or around 7 hours - or 'overnight' \u2013 from a domestic plug.\n\nCity slicker: Bentley reckons the 168-cell lithium-ion battery can be charged fully charged in just 2.5 hours using a fast-charger\n\nFor the style-conscious, designer Philippe Starke has even created a special home-charging port.\n\nBentley is being cautious about the battery performance until officially signed off and was originally looking at a range of around 30 miles in electric-only mode, though that may prove optimistic with 16 miles being spoken of in California.\n\nSimilarly, early hopes of fuel economy of around 50mpg may be well wide of the mark.\n\nBut it is hoping to keep CO2 emissions below 100g/km, but we'll have to wait for the official figures. The US system of measuring is different to the UK and EU so risks giving a misleading impression.\n\nIt needs to be under75g/km and to be able to drive on electric only for minimum of 20 miles to qualify for London Ultra Low Emissions Zone.\n\nThough it has the potential for being a tad distracting, you can watch your driving performance on screen on the centre console \u2013 as the energy generated by your driving helps keep the battery charged.\n\nBentley chief executive Adrian Hallmark gave a handy tip for maximising charge: 'The harder you drive it, the more you charge it.'\n\nThe firm sees the Bentayga Hybrid as merely their 'first step towards electrification.'\n\nIt pledged to have a hybrid option for every car by 2023, with its first pure electric car by 2025.\n\n'When we do it, it will be a world beater,' says Hallmark who next week unveils a concept electric self-driving GT car codenamed 'EXP100GT'", "description": "The new hybrid Bentley 4X4 has killed off the earlier diesel version, or rather replaced the ill-fated oil-burner after its exceptionally short lifespan of around two years.", "authors": ["Ray Massey Motoring Editor For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
