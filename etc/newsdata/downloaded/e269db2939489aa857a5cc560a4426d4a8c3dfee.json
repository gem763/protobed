REUTERS/Staff\n\nECB chief Mario Draghi told governments to do more to revive an ailing euro zone economy as he cut rates deeper into negative territory and pledged indefinite monetary stimulus, tying the hands of his successor for years to come and initially driving stock markets higher.\n\nBank stocks .SX7E, which wavered after the decision, rose on Friday, with analysts citing the ECB\u2019s easing of the terms of its long term loans to banks and the introduction of a tiered deposit rate as offsetting the pain of negative rates.\n\n\u201cBy exempting a significant chunk of bank deposits from the negative deposit rate and making its offer of long-term liquidity for banks even more generous, the ECB is mitigating the impact of a negative deposit rate on bank balance sheets,\u201d said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg.\n\n\u201cBy lowering funding costs further, it can make it easier for governments to finance a modest fiscal expansion and nudge countries with some extra fiscal space to actually use it \u2013 think Germany.\u201d\n\nBoth the pan-European STOXX 600 index and the euro zone only index .STOXXE were higher after an hour\u2019s trade, but the gains were muted and suggested investors may have had their fill after four weeks of gains that have indexes back near levels last seen in July.\n\nConcerns linger about the extent to which the central bank\u2019s stimulus can boost economic growth or stop the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy from slipping into recession. The Ifo institute cut its 2019 growth forecast for Germany on Thursday, predicting a recession in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOn balance, this round of ECB policy easing is seen as generally growth-supportive at the margin, but may not significantly move the growth dial,\u201d said Selena Ling, Head of Strategy and Research at OCBC.\n\nTrade-reliant commodity-linked .SXPP and automotive .SXAP stocks were boosted by fresh indications that a prolonged trade war between the United States and China was thawing.\n\nAfter Beijing and Washington made tariff concessions to each other, U.S. President Donald Trump said he could consider an interim trade deal with China ahead of high-level negotiations in October.\n\nThe food & beverage index .SX3P was the biggest decliner on the STOXX 600 as investors continued to rotate out of defensive stocks.\n\nRoche Holding (ROG.S) was the biggest boost to the index as it reported positive data from a primary progressive MS (PPMS) study.\n\nFrench conglomerate Bollore Group (BOLL.PA) was also among the best performers after posting a 27% increase in first-half core earnings.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) rose 1.6% after becoming the first of 16 financial services companies to resolve claims that it conspired to rig prices of bonds issued by Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK).", "description": "European shares ground out gains for the fourth day running on Friday as signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks propped up shares after a mixed response to stimulus from the European Central Bank a day earlier.", "authors": ["Sagarika Jaisinghani", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429352008&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0I4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
