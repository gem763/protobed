It's a very old pub, a place where the pack horses from the hills, bringing the wool down to the Stroud mills, used to stop for refreshment.\n\nThe Woolpack is on the old, lower lane running through Slad, where I have a cottage.\n\nSo we are very at home here. I remember it with such vividness because the central bar was the scene of a famous occasion when I was a boy.\n\nVincent, an ex-village lad, had broken two taboos. One taboo, he'd left the village, which you are not supposed to do as a young man, you stick with the village through thick and thin. He'd left the village and gone abroad, to New Zealand. But worse than that, he broke a second taboo. He came back, loaded with gold and boasting.\n\nLost recordings of writer Laurie Lee are to be published for the first time. Pictured: Laurie Lee's much-loved book Cider With Rosie was turned into a television drama in 2015\n\nAnd he dropped in here just before Christmas one snowy night, flashing his gold coins around. He said not only how rich he was but that he never touched his cap to anyone.\n\n'Not like you, grovelling on the mud of Stroud. All you see of society is Stroud on a Saturday night. Me, I have a horse and carriage at home in New Zealand and I eat meat every day, and what's more, I pay for my drinks in gold.'\n\nAnd he brought out these sovereigns and he laid them out on the counter. And he kept on ordering drinks and flashing his gold around and the young men sitting round watched him, they drank his drink, they kept silent, but they kept watching him, quiet eyes and glowing cigarettes, which he bought for them.\n\nThen one by one they slipped away into the blizzard.\n\nHe went on until closing time, then he paid for his bill and went out into the snow and walked up to where his parents lived at the top of the village. He walked up singing into the blizzard. I'm sure I heard him singing that night. People in the village could hear that boasting, singing voice going up.\n\nBut as he got near the war memorial the lads met him, and stopped him and said, 'Well, Vincent,' and they hit him and they knocked him down and they kicked him.\n\nThey stole his watch and they threw him over the wall. And in the morning he was found frozen to death.\n\nTV producer David Parker recorded the writer Laurie Lee (pictured age 48) as they walked around his home village of Slad, Gloucestershire, reminiscing about his childhood haunts\n\nYou don't go away, and you don't come back boasting of riches which the young men had not been able to achieve. If you come back a pauper, on your hands and knees asking for soup, they'll take you in and look after you. But if you come back throwing your gold sovereigns down on the bar, flashing your gold watches, they don't forgive that.\n\nHe wasn't exactly murdered, he was ritually slaughtered. We clammed up and we were told as children never to mention it.\n\nLater, about ten years later, an old woman, the mother of one of those who'd killed him, was dying. She saw a stranger sitting by her bed and she said: 'Who's this?' And her daughter said: 'Don't worry, it's only a police gentleman, he doesn't want to make any trouble, he just wants to know what happened to the watch, mother, that's all he wants to know.'\n\nAnd the old lady sat up in bed and looked at him, then laid back, closed her eyes, and died.\n\nI like to feel that's how we guarded ourselves in the past. Nobody ever spoke, nobody ever went to the police, but we all knew 'who done it'.\n\nThe writer, Laurie Lee, as a young boy\n\nAnd Vincent's murderers grew to be respectable parishioners, parents, but they treated Vincent . . . well, he was a vagabond. All this happened in this pub, the place in which judgment was passed.\n\nI think it's true that you should never return. I've been forgiven. I returned at a difficult time because, unlike Vincent who hadn't told a lot of stories about the village, I had.\n\nAnd you can tell any story in the bar about your neighbours and it's a joke, but you put it in print and you've broken a taboo. It took me a lot of time, living that down.\n\nBut if you live in a village there is this tight enclosed community. We're not working out a soap opera, we're living our own particular history, and sharing that particular history of failures, disasters, happiness, life and death, marriages.\n\nAnd each of us thinks at times we are isolated. That we know the secrets of everybody else, but that we ourselves are protected by isolation. We're not. We know the secrets of everyone else, thank God, at the expense of their knowing our secrets, too.\n\nAs a writer, I would say that whether or not putting it all down on paper sets you apart depends on how you tell the stories of the village.\n\nI wrote a bit about an uncle who I adored, he was one of the heroes of my youth. He drove a bus, a double-decker bus, and he liked cider, and he'd stand no nonsense. He once got out of his bus when we were coming back from Weston on an outing.\n\nThere was a man in a hedge threatening his wife. My uncle stopped the bus, got out and knocked the man through the hedge, in order to protect the wife. Then the wife attacked him for having hit her husband. But he gets back into the bus and drives home singing. And we all think top Uncle Sid, because he was a hero.\n\nBut he got into trouble. He got his double-decker bus stuck under a railway bridge and we as boys went to see what had happened and he'd been sacked. He'd been sacked because he'd got a jar of cider in the front of his bus, and I mentioned this quite naturally [in Cider With Rosie].\n\nHis children thought it was a bit excessive, abominable in fact, to tell these stories about Uncle Sid, in print. The London Evening Standard did some excerpts and they used that, so I telephoned my cousin and I said I was very sorry and I wasn't thinking: 'I do apologise and I'll cut it out of the next edition.'\n\n'Oh you don't have to do that, there's no occasion to do that you know,' she said. She was obviously being very kind to me but I do understand that he is part of the book, therefore I wish it to be known what a hero he was and why he was such a hero to me and it did go into print.\n\nIt was meant as a tribute of my affection for him, and my admiration for him, and so it's still there.\n\nI was sitting outside the pub recently and two girls came up to me. They were part of a school group, it was about five to eleven. They were doing O-levels and they said to me: 'Excuse me sir, can you tell me where Laurie Lee's buried?' A certain shiver of mortality ran through me and I said: 'He's in the public bar, otherwise he'd be up in the woods.'\n\nLaurie Lee recalls his relationship with local poet (and fierce cricketer) Frank Mansell as he visits his grave in the churchyard, Miserden:\n\nThis is the grave of my old chum Frank Mansell in Miserden churchyard, quite near to where he was brought up. We had some grand times together. He was a remarkable fellow, Cotswold as a dry stone wall.\n\nRugged, windswept, honest, rooted in these hills. He was also a strange mixture, he was a workman, he worked for the post office, he was an astrologer, he was a demon bowler in the local cricket team at Sheepscombe, and he had a feeling for these stones. He was a marvellous local poet.\n\nHe showed me some of his ballads, as he called them, when I first came back to Slad. We used to meet in the pub and go through each other's work. And his poetry was so direct and so local and so genuine, innocent and strong, like him, that we thought we could get it published.\n\nSo between us we set up a publishing firm called the Wittantree Press. It was named after an old tree, a windswept tree, which is bent from the west to the east by the prevailing wind.\n\nHe always felt that the way he walked bore that kind of windswept look about it. And he was absolutely right. It was mostly an inclination from the west to the east which inclined his huge muscular body to the prevailing wind.\n\nBut as well as that, coming back from the pub in Bisley, after his drink, which was known as Old Peculier, this gave him that sort of inclination. An inclination which I shared.\n\nSo we got this little printer down in Cainscross and we set him up with a little paperback. Then, when we had printed off 2,000, we'd go round the pubs with a little box of these and we'd stick them around the bar. And he sold all 2,000, which was almost unheard of, even for a well-known London poet, to sell 2,000.\n\nWe had a second printing, and he went into hardback. And at that stage I began to get rather jealous, but I swallowed my pride and enjoyed the fact that we were living off, drinking, our profits as we went around.\n\nHe died young, at 60. I saw him the day before he died and I've got a recording of him telling me of a quick way to go from Slad to a pub that was up on the top on the other side of Minchinhampton.\n\nAnd he was telling me about all the shortcuts and all the lanes. I thought I knew them all but he was just telling me, very slumberously, because he was quite ill then. But in this very rough, eloquent, Cotswold voice, he told me how to get from Slad to this pub he wanted me to go to the next day and check up on the sales.\n\nBut the next day his friend rang me up early in the morning. He had died in the morning, very suddenly, not of the disease with which he was pressed by but something quite different, coronary heart.\n\nAnd he was buried here. And he was so well known, we had a church full and people gathered in the churchyard.\n\nHe lived in a little cottage called the Salt Box. He is remembered as lord of the manor of the Salt Box, Sheepscombe.\n\nHe lived there, alone for most of the time I knew him. He ran a little vegetable garden and wrote these long astrological predictions for old ladies. They used to send him a note saying, can you prophesy what is going to happen?\n\nSeriously, he would write down their birth date, and sheets of paper would go out very carefully composed, spinning the most unlikely futures for these old dears.\n\nBut he believed in it and they believed in it and although I'd tease him about it, I never really said, 'Look, it's a cop-out, you know very well', because he didn't think it was. He believed he was close to the stars and close to the seasons.\n\nAnd looking back at the old days we had, and remembering the way he talked, I believe he was close to the stars and as far as I'm concerned he is always alive to the seasons and the stars when I come back from London or wherever I have been.\n\nFrank had this double loyalty or threefold loyalty. He went to the village school in Bisley. Miserden was also very much an alter ego as it was part of the triangle with the Salt Box down the road, and he was also very closely connected with Sheepscombe where we've got a seat for him looking out over the cricket field.\n\nHe was a demon bowler in the Sheepscombe side. He used to come up the hill, it was a sloping field, and you'd see the top of his head as he was running up, then you would see his shoulders, furious face, and then the rest of his body.\n\nIt was just like a galleon coming over the horizon, all guns blazing, and he'd whip the ball down and if the ball did not kill the batsman, furious anger and frustration would kill him.\n\n'That should 'a got thee,' he'd say. 'It should 'a got thee.' And if he didn't get five bloody heads in one innings he was a disappointed man, a terrorizer.\n\nHe was a Norman I think in many ways. I used to tease him about it: 'Frank Mansell,' I said, 'you came over, you were a predator, you were one of the conquerors who showed off, you were responsible.'\n\n'Ah,' he said, 'that was in the old days, we had some land then, we lost it all, through bewilderment, and drink and corruption.'\n\n'Not corrupt, not corruption Frank, you were never corrupt.'\n\nI can hear him now, but I can't remember his style. There is a recording of us both giving a double recital, you can imagine the feeling, the daredevil feeling we had, at Cheltenham Ladies' College.\n\nWe marched in together, him on the left of stage and me on the right, and we really played to the audience: 'Any questions?'\n\n'Yes, what makes you a true poet?'\n\n'Never get married,' he said. 'It's death to poetry.'\n\nHe was married twice as far as I know and gave people a lot of happiness, but in dropping that bombshell at Cheltenham Ladies' College, it made the teachers twitch a bit.\n\nDown In The Valley by Laurie Lee is published by Penguin Classics on November 7, \u00a312.99. \u00a9 Laurie Lee.\n\nTo order a copy for \u00a310.39 call 01603 648155 or go to mailshop.co.uk.
