You need the good people on board and I don\u2019t think you get that by clampdowns.\n\n\u201cThe far right were organised in that example \u2013 they need banning. If you ban all fans it works against you.\u201d\n\nA Bulgaria fan holds up a `No Respect\u00b4 sweatshirt (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nGrebby called on UEFA and domestic leagues to invest more in anti-racism education programmes.\n\n\u201cUltimately unless they put more money into anti-racism education, all the sanctions in the world and all the bans in the world don\u2019t change attitudes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt would be simple to throw Bulgaria out of the tournament wouldn\u2019t it? I notice the Bulgarians have already given out two-year banning orders. If you want to give out a strong message, two years is not a strong message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like lifetime bans, you\u2019re not leaving yourself open to changing attitudes. It has to involve education and it depends how they react to that education.\u201d\n\nThe match was initially halted in the 28th minute and the first step of UEFA\u2019s anti-racism protocol was invoked, with a stadium announcement being made urging the abuse to stop.\n\nWhen it continued, there was another stoppage just before half-time, although it was later clarified that this did not constitute the enactment of the second step of the protocol, which requires the teams to be taken off the pitch temporarily. The third and final step of the protocol is to abandon the match.\n\nEngland\u2019s players and staff were widely praised for their behaviour in the face of the abuse, and they completed the match, running out 6-0 winners.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s football association president Borislav Mihaylov, who criticised comments made by England players about the potential for racist behaviour in the build-up to the match, has since resigned.\n\nBulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov has resigned since the 6-0 defeat to England (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nSo too has national coach Krasimir Balakov, who claimed on the night not to have heard the abuse. He has been replaced by Georgi Dermendzhiev.\n\nBulgaria were also charged with throwing objects, disruption of a national anthem and showing replays on a giant screen.\n\nEngland were charged with disruption of a national anthem and with providing insufficient stewards.", "description": "UEFA\u00b4s control, ethics and disciplinary body will decide Bulgaria\u00b4s fate on Monday.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/12/wire-20242630-1572177905-985_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
