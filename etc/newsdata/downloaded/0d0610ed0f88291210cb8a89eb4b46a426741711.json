Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican and former US ambassador under George W. Bush when asked about Giuliani. Rooney noted \u201cmore things keep coming up in the investigation\u201d and the investigation should look at who \u201cwho else was involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey called Watergate a witch hunt,\u201d Rooney noted\u2026\n\nBut some Republican aides say members are growing uneasy with Giuliani\u2019s role and closeness to the President in light of the recent allegations that are piling up against the President\u2019s personal lawyer.
