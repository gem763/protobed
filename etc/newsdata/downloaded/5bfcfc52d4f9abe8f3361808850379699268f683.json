Adam Schiff (D-CA) as he is getting blasted by Republicans and those who care about truth for his fabrications in regard to the Ukraine whistleblower story.\n\nBut it looks like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) wins the prize for the most ridiculous defense.\n\nAre you ready? Here it is:\n\nIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s harmful. And his bigotry is reflective of the white supremacist base he relies on for political gain. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cUnderstand that Trump is engaged in deliberate, atrocious, targeted antisemitism towards Chairman Schiff,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cThen ask yourself why no one cares to denounce it \u2013 esp when his accusation of it towards others drove full news cycles earlier this year.\u201d\n\nWait, what? Criticism of Schiff is anti-Semitism? Is she kidding? The article she cites basically says Trump calling Democrats \u201csavages\u201d and Schiff \u201cshifty\u201d is anti-Semitic.\n\nUm, perhaps the criticism has to do with the fact that Schiff has a small problem with the truth that everyone has seen, from fabricating quotes and not telling the truth about the whistleblower matter to telling Americans he has \u201cevidence\u201d that will prove collusion between the Trump team and Russia, but never producing it.\n\nHow about calling out your colleague for not telling the truth?\n\nMaybe this says more about what\u2019s going in AOC\u2019s head then anything else, that she equates perfectly reasonable criticism of lying to anti-Semitism.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t even so much a defense of Adam Schiff as an attempt to excuse her sisters in The Squad, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) who have gotten in trouble for their anti-Semitic comments in the past, hence the reason for the second sentence in her tweet.\n\nNeedless to say, she got justifiably schooled for this hot take, as Twitchy notes.\n\nWhen your party gets caught lying, scream racism/antisemitism to distract from your misdeed. \u2014 Colorado RedTraci (@goptraci) October 5, 2019\n\nYour state has become the number 1 state for hate crimes against Jews. Your squad members have tooted the horn of dog whistles, when it comes to their antisemitism.\n\nYour collab with Corbyn is disturbing to say the least.\n\nPerhaps you have no leg to stand on when it comes to AS. https://t.co/zbeuk1xQxR \u2014 Claire Voltaire (@Claire_Voltaire) October 5, 2019\n\nThis, again, is a despicable appropriation of genuine Jewish concerns about anti-Semitism to shield partisans from criticism. And it's especially despicable coming from a person who regularly defends and normalizes anti-Semitism in US politics. https://t.co/RmLWzqU8Pw \u2014 David Harsanyi (@davidharsanyi) October 5, 2019\n\nThis is such garbage. I don't care what you think of Trump. AOC and Hasan are two of the loudest voices that have excused blatant antisemitism on the left now diminishing actual antisemitism with baseless accusations. https://t.co/6bVIzvvrmq \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) October 5, 2019\n\nPerhaps the best response came from former White House Press Secretary for George W. Bush, Ari Fleischer:\n\nAnti-semitism is real and it is horrible. Politicians shouldn\u2019t dilute its meaning and its seriousness by slinging it around to attack their opponents. AOC is reckless and her judgment is awful. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) October 5, 2019", "description": "Oh My: AOC Says Criticism of Adam Schiff Is Now Anti-Semitism", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Stu Cvrk", "Alex Parker", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOCThisWeek.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
