But there\u2019s one update in particular that Simmers are losing their minds about: customisable stairs.\n\nThere are so many kinds of houses you can build with segmented staircases, and I could not previously build any of them in The Sims. Before this, making L-shaped stairs required some really annoying finagling in order to trick the game into letting you do something it\u2019s not supposed to do. Soon, I will be able to make these stairs without all the hassle. The sudden influx of architectural possibilities is melting my brain.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot more than the stairs just being L-shaped or U-shaped \u2014 they will soon be totally customisable. You can swing each segment left or right and adjust how many stairs are in each segment. You could even conceivably create a spiral staircase this way, which is everything I\u2019ve ever wanted from this game.\n\nOther Simmers are sharing my enthusiasm, to say the least. If you search \u201cSims stairs\u201d on Twitter, all you will see is unbridled enthusiasm.\n\nYouTuber Lilsimsie, a self described \u201cweenie and little freak,\u201d actually cried. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m crying about stairs in The Sims. I\u2019m a Sims freak!\u201d she said, crying on the phone to her mum, who replied, \u201cThat is so funny.\u201d\n\nThis free update is coming to The Sims 4 on Friday and I will be waiting. There are stairs I have to adjust.", "description": "In a free update for the game\u2019s fifth anniversary, The Sims 4 will get new \u201cMuslim-inspired\u201d architecture and clothes, like hijabs and nehru collars, as well as some new patio items.
