( VMI ) was upgraded to a buy by TheStreet's Quant Ratings service. Regular readers of Kamich's Korner know that I often use this quantitative service for identifying some attractive stocks that are not on my radar. I also find it useful to point out potential \"landmines\" of stocks that are downgraded.\n\nLet's check out the charts of VMI.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of VMI, below, we can see an interesting and potentially very bullish price pattern. Use your imagination and drawn a horizontal line across the $140 level. This could be the \"neckline\" of an inverse head-and-shoulders bottom formation. The left shoulder is in October, the head in December and the right shoulder in early June.\n\nPrices have broken out above the neckline and it looks like we are getting a retest of the line again. Prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line. A bullish golden cross of the 50-day and 200-day averages can be seen in early August.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a rising pattern from December and it is close to making a new high for the move up to confirm the price action. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of VMI, below, we can see a bullish setup. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is very bullish and signals some very aggressive buying in recent weeks. The MACD oscillator is also bullish and above the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of VMI, below, we can see a big base pattern and an initial upside price target of $155.\n\nBottom-line strategy: A quantitative buy recommendation and a very strong chart pattern suggest we need to be buyers around $140 if available. Risk below $130 for now. The first target is $155 and the second price target is $170.", "description": "Valmont Industries technical analysis and strategy on trading the stock....VMI", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Under-The-Radar Valmont Industries Could Surprise On The Upside", "Let'S Check Out The Charts Of Vmi", "Which Recent Received A Quant Upgrade.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Dave Butler", "Mark Sebastian", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/cc3685fb-1c1b-11e8-8cb9-17fd23195e93.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
