It affects around 1,950 people each year in the UK. A common early symptom is having a painless swelling in the armpits, neck and groin. Some people also experience heavy night sweating, extreme weight loss, itching, shortness of breath and coughing. Hodgkin's lymphoma is most common between the ages of 20 and 24, and 75 and 79. It has been linked to people with lowered immunity, a family history of the condition, smokers and those who are overweight. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, steroids and stem cell or bone marrow transplants.

We just had another drink and forgot about it \u2013 I didn't want it to ruin my weekend.\n\n'I decided to ignore it for a bit to see if it would go down.\n\n'It was about the size of a 20p, and I just thought it must be a gland.\n\n'By the time I had it removed, on September 24, it was the size of a milk bottle cap.'\n\nMiss Pritchard had also been bothered with night sweats - another common sign of the cancer, but she just put it down to the hot weather.\n\nShe said: 'Looking back now, it was different. I was soaking, my hair was completely wet.\n\n'Then I went away in September to Marbella with my sister [Olivia, 23] family and friends.\n\n'I got off the plane and was struggling to breathe. It felt as though someone was sitting on my chest and I couldn't get a proper breath unless I bent to the side.\n\nMiss Pritchard, pictured with her boyfriend, Nat, 20, had chest pains while on holiday in Marbella. She visited her GP when she came back\n\nBy the time Miss Pritchard had the lump in her neck (see left) removed, on September 24, it was the size of a milk bottle cap' (see right)\n\n'That stayed for the whole holiday, but still, once I came back to see the doctor I didn't think it was anything to worry about.'\n\nMiss Pritchard was sent for a chest X-ray by her GP and the next day, she received a worrying phone call to come back.\n\nShe received an official diagnosis of stage two Hodgkin's lymphoma on October 4, after a biopsy.\n\nShe said: 'It was awful, you don't really imagine that's what they will tell you when you go to the doctor. It's the worst thing me or my family have ever been through.\n\n'The rest of the day I was surrounded by my family and boyfriend, Nat, to understand what was happening.\n\n'The doctors reassured me everything would be fine and I would be cured. They said if you're going to get cancer its one of the best to get. It was really positive.'\n\nAround 2,100 people in the UK are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma each year, and 300 people die.\n\nIn the US, 8,110 people are diagnosed every year, and 1,000 people die, according to figures.\n\nThe disease develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.\n\nMiss Pritchard had one last blow-out trip to London with friends before she started six cycles of chemotherapy on October 16.\n\nShe said: 'I couldn't live a normal life. Everything was on hold for a few months.\n\nMiss Pritchard said she had no idea what lymphoma cancer was but she 'knew it was something bad' from the way the doctor said it. She is pictured after reaching remission\n\nMiss Pritchard said losing her hair was the hardest part of her journey because strangers knew she was ill. She cut it off before chemotherapy (pictured)\n\n'I had sickness, a tummy ache, an aching body, a horrible taste in my mouth and no appetite for food. It's like having a really bad hangover \u2013 but it sticks around for five or six days.\n\n'I know it sounds bad but losing my hair was the worst part. It made it so obvious to strangers I was ill, and they didn't know who I was before.\n\n'To begin with I was a bit upset, but throughout it I never felt down I just had to crack on with it and get on with my life.'\n\nOn June 3 this year, Miss Pritchard awaited the results of scans which would reveal if the cancer had gone.\n\nShe said: 'My name was finally called and my doctor was so calm. You can tell what's coming the moment you see your doctors face; she was smiling.\n\n'The moment she told me I was in remission\u2026 I just couldn't stop crying, for me it still hasn't really sunk in even now.\n\n'I\u2019ve learnt more about myself in the last few months then I have ever before. It\u2019s opened my eyes up to what I have and what life is really about, being healthy and happy, everything else is really quite insignificant.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Grace Pritchard, now 20, of Worcestershire, was only diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma last October when she visited her GP about breathing difficulties.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19305892-0-image-a-21_1570206217185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
