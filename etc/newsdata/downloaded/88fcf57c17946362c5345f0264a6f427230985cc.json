No form of propaganda can sever the people of Iran and Iraq.\"\n\nIran has accused its foes of deliberately stirring trouble in Iraq at a time when vast numbers of pilgrims are heading there for one of the world's largest religious events.\n\n191007063239250\n\nA top military adviser to Khamenei said those behind the unrest would be unable to deter the faithful, however.\n\n\"They want to scare people into not going to Arbaeen, but even if it rains arrows and stones, Hussein's lovers will not be afraid,\" Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.\n\nArbaeen marks the end of the 40-day mourning period for the seventh-century killing of Imam Hussein by the forces of the Caliph Yazid.\n\nLast week, Iran urged citizens who were planning to head to Iraq to delay their travel for the pilgrimage, which culminates on October 17 with the Arbaeen commemoration.\n\nOn Monday, Iran reopened the Khosravi border crossing with Iraq following its closure last week as the protests raged.\n\nIRNA said the fact that the \"provocations\" came ahead of Arbaeen showed Iran's enemies were \"scared\".\n\n'Hidden hands'\n\nJudiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi said those responsible for the unrest in Iraq aimed to undermine Arbaeen.\n\n\"The seditionists intend to undermine and sap enthusiasm for this great event,\" he said, quoted by state television's website.\n\n\"The vigilant people of Iraq exposed this sedition. But everyone must be careful. The seditionists are seeking new tricks at any moment to overshadow the Arbaeen ceremony and to undermine it.\"\n\nThe hardline Keyhan newspaper said \"evidence\" pointed to the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel being involved.\n\nA columnist in the reformist Shargh daily also suggested the Americans, Israelis and Saudis might be the \"hidden hands\" behind the Iraqi protests.\n\n\"Even if that is not the case, the chaotic and tense situation in Iraq today can prepare the grounds for these actors to ride the wave to fulfil their objectives and demands,\" wrote Abdelrahman Fathollahi.", "description": "Iran accuses its foes of deliberately stirring trouble at a time when pilgrims head to Iraq for a major religious event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/5fb9ef96df4444d7b1d93d9f70259a18_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
