Here's how to choose between them\n\nLapland: a mystical, snow-whipped Arctic expanse; a land so esoteric that a survey last year found almost a third of British respondents believe it to be fictional. You\u2019d be forgiven, too, for not knowing that this boomerang-shaped region takes in not one but three Scandanivan countries \u2013 the far northern clutches of Norway, Sweden and Finland.\n\nBooking a holiday to Lapland, therefore, is as much a question of unpicking these neighbouring cultures and landscapes as it would be for a foreigner choosing between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\nAll of Lapland is blanketed in magic, under the spell of the Northern Lights and roamed by the indingeous S\u00e1mi people and their reindeer, but each has its own allure; be it Finland and its status as the world capital of Christmas, Sweden, home to the original Icehotel, or Norway, land of the fjords.
