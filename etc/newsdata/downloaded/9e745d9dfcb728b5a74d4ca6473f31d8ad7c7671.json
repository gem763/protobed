Baby Archie, the first child of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, is the irrefutable proof.\n\nMaking a debut during the couple\u2019s visit to South Africa, Archie was revealed to the world in all of his smiley splendour. Young mate accompanied his parents as they lunched with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Leah Tutu at the couple\u2019s foundation, and we urge you to have a peek at the footage.\n\nCNN reports Archie was given kids\u2019 books as a gift, while Prince Harry was handed a framed photograph of his mother, Princess Diana, meeting with South African reformer Nelson Mandela in 1997.\n\nAfter that engagement, Markle attended a meeting with Mothers2Mothers, a charity which trains HIV-positive women in community healthcare.\n\nIn addition to donating a bunch of clothes which Archie has outgrown, cameras caught the moment she shared an impromptu group hug with fans waiting outside.\n\nThe royal tour will continue for a few more days, which is enough time for us to pore over piccies of Archie and comment on how much he looks like his dad.\n\nREAD MORE Dylan Alcott Shares Letter From Prince Harry Ft.
