Get Me Out Of Here!\n\nThe Good Morning Britain host is tipped to be in the line-up this year. It is yet to be confirmed, but she can see potential pitfalls.\n\nKate said: \u201cI\u2019m really scared of snakes, spiders and rats. I\u2019m claustrophobic and I don\u2019t really like heights.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, she added: \u201cI\u2019m not very good without food. I genuinely eat chocolate every single day, a massive slab of it. I\u2019ve done that since I was 16.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have the strategy to survive. I think I would be a constant disappointment to the rest of the team.\u201d\n\nKate does see one perk of living in the Australian bush.\n\nShe says: \u201cI\u2019m very untidy.\n\n\u201cSo the only consolation would be that I can\u2019t make the jungle any more messy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former I'm A Celeb campmate Nick Knowles opened up about how isolating the jungle can be.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to stick together and look after each other\", he said.\n\n\"You have to look out for people having a wobble, it can be isolating in there if you are not careful.\n\n\"All about the support.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
