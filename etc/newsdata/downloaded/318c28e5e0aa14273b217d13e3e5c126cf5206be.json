I've got to be quite careful with what I tell you because we've filmed quite a big piece on behind the scenes, which is coming out next week.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"First of all, Cain goes and attacks Pete but as soon as he finds out it's Nate, I can tell you that he lures them onto what he calls a 'fishing trip'.\n\n\"They go up to the river, he gets them on the boat, there's a fight. He gets a hold of a plan of wood, he attacks him. Somebody's going under water.\n\n\"Is this going to be the time he kills for real? Because he has got murder in his eyes.\"\n\nThis comes after actress Sally Dexter, who plays Faith, promised a \"heavy storm\" is on the way for the Dingles, as \"dire consequences\" occur as a result of a new twist regarding the newcomer's real identity.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nNate arrived in the Dales earlier in the year, and it wasn't long before he was clashing with village favourite Cain Dingle.\n\nViewers soon predicted there was more to his back story though and he might even have a link to Cain, after some suspicious behaviour.\n\nFrom starting an affair with his wife Moira Dingle, to trying to get his child Kyle taken out of his care, it's clear he has a vendetta against him - while viewers are still unsure of his exact identity.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nNow, Sally has teased her character Faith, Cain's mother, will be directly involved in the reveal and its consequences.\n\nShe confirmed emotional scenes were on the cards, even welling up as she spoke exclusively to Mirror Online at the Inside Soap Awards 2019 about the upcoming plot with the affair, and Nate's true identity, set to come to light.\n\nNot only did Sally hint that not everyone would make it through, she confirmed three characters in particular would suffer as a result.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSally told us: \"Yes, there is a very shocking twist with Nate's identity and it has dire consequences for my son Cain, for Moira my daughter-in-law, and me.\"\n\nShe added: \"We have to come through a heavy storm and some of us might not make it. It was some of the most harrowingly emotional scenes I've ever done.\"\n\nPraising her co-stars, the actress welled up before confirming an exit of sorts would be on the horizon for Faith in the fallout.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"[They're] very special, and I care about them a lot. It might be the case that Faith has to go away.\"\n\nIt's thought the big October scenes could see the truth come out, with this being when Moira and Nate are exposed.\n\nWhat exactly goes down, and who Nate really is, will be held top secret until closer to the time - so viewers should stay tuned.\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode airing on Thursdays at 8pm.", "description": "Cain Dingle could finally kill someone and has 'murder in his eyes' when he discovers his wife is having an affair on Emmerdale", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Itv", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584308.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emmerdale-Faith-and-Pete-talk-about-Moira.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
