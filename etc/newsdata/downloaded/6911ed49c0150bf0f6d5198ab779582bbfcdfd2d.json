Why are you doing this stupid thing? he thinks to himself. I\u2019ll never do it again.\n\n\u201cAnd I do it again and again,\u201d Steinholm says in Tim Kemple\u2019s short documentary, The Running Pastor. \u201cI have to do it. My body needs it, or my soul, or my mind. It\u2019s something almost magical.\u201d\n\nThe film, from Camp4 Collective and Merrell, is a dynamic portrait of the Faroe Islands native, for whom running is a form of therapy. The son of a shepherd on an island where there are more sheep than people, Steinholm has a deep reverence for the North Atlantic archipelago and its dramatic landscape. But he knows its people, too\u2014Steinholm is the local pastor. He is the thread that runs through Faroese life, from its rugged cliffs to its population\u2019s intimate desires.\n\nKemple\u2019s stunning drone cinematography captures Steinholm in conversation with his environment through the act of trail running. \u201cHe would run the ridges until they ended, take in the view, and then come bounding back to us,\u201d Kemple told me. \u201cHe was like a kid in a candy store. He loves being out there.\u201d Kemple, who is a climber, said he was impressed with Steinholm\u2019s agility as he traversed the exposed mountain ridges. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone move as effortlessly in that kind of terrain.\u201d", "description": "A Faroese pastor shares his reverence for the natural world.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/08/Saunders_Merrell_Faroe_3012/video-featured.jpg"}
