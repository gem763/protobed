Men carrying high-caliber weapons blocked major intersections.\n\nAmid the chaos, inmates at a prison rioted, seized weapons from guards and fled. Fifty-six prisoners escaped, and 49 were still at large Friday, according to Sinaloa Public Security Secretary Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda. Two guards were taken captive and later freed.\n\nVehicles burn in a street of Culiacan, state of Sinaloa, Mexico, on October 17, 2019.

You cannot fight fire with fire,\" he added. \"We do not want deaths. We do not want war.\"\n\nBut Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration who worked undercover in Mexico, called the violence \"a massive black eye to the Mexican government\" and a \"sign that the cartels are more powerful\" than it is.\n\n\"This is going to set an example for the other groups,\" Vigil told the Associated Press. \"It sends them the message that if they capture a member of the cartel, all they have to do is go in the city and intimidate the citizenry and security forces.\"\n\nStreets in Culiac\u00e1n, a city of over 800,000, remained blocked with torched cars Friday morning. Schools were closed, and some public offices asked their employees to stay home. Few buses were running.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza, a lawyer for El Chapo's family, told The Associated Press that Guzm\u00e1n's family has said \"Ovidio is alive and free,\" but that he had no more details about what had happened.\n\nOvidio is not one of the drug lord's best-known sons. Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n are known as \"Los Chapitos,\" or \"the little Chapos,\" and are believed to be running their father's cartel together with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada. But Ovidio was indicted in 2018 by a grand jury in Washington, along with a fourth brother, for the alleged trafficking of cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.\n\nMen look at burnt vehicles after heavily armed gunmen waged an all-out battle against Mexican security forces in Culiacan, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on October 18, 2019. ALFREDO ESTRELLA/ AFP via Getty\n\nAfter authorities discovered Guzm\u00e1n on Thursday, Culiac\u00e1n exploded in violence. Armed civilians in trucks roared through the city's center, shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns.\n\nVideos published on social media showed a scene resembling a war zone, with gunmen, some wearing black ski masks over their faces, riding in the back of trucks firing mounted machine guns as vehicles burned. People could be seen running for cover as machine-gun fire rattled around them. Drivers frantically drove in reverse to get away from the clashes.\n\nCasta\u00f1eda, the Sinaloa public safety director, told Milenio television that gunmen blocked streets with burning vehicles, a common tactic to make it difficult for security forces to maneuver.\n\n\"Nothing is working,\" said Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez, a worker in the state's congress who shut himself in his house after picking up his 15-year-old son from school. \"There is a psychosis. No one knows what is going on but everyone is afraid and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow.\"\n\nGonz\u00e1lez added that Culiac\u00e1n had not seen such a scene for almost a decade when the Sinaloa Cartel was experiencing an internal war.\n\nSinaloa is home to the cartel by the same name, which was led by El Chapo. Guzm\u00e1n was sentenced to life in prison in the United States in July.\n\nAfter Guzm\u00e1n's third arrest in 2016, an internal battle for succession began playing out between his many sons. The battle was resolved with the arrest of Damaso L\u00f3pez Nunez and his son D\u00e1maso L\u00f3pez Serrano, who led a rival faction.", "description": "At least eight people were killed in the chaos", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/e2429998-722a-4a9e-9030-60a9c67a779b/thumbnail/1200x630/420e67bda96f2d947475c8b33d6548a5/cartel-2019-10-18t000000z-1831840473-rc1e1df7dae0-rtrmadp-3-mexico-violence-sinaloa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
