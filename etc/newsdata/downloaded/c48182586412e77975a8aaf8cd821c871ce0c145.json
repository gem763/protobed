Thanks a lot.\n\nJust look at the detail (Picture: Crochetverse/Stephanie Pokorny)\n\nStephanie told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I actually began crocheting at 16 when my grandma taught me.\n\n\u2018She used to create small lap blankets for our local Veterans Hospital and I would watch her work.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll these years later and now Stephanie can come up with full-body monster and alien outfits.\n\n\u2018The costumes each take about 40-50 hours of work time which I usually spread over about two weeks,\u2019 Stephanie says.\n\nShe makes outfits for adults too (Picture: Crochetverse/Stephanie Pokorny)\n\n\u2018Each year, I work to improve my skills so I can achieve the highest amount of detail and realism for my boys, so I would have to say that each newest costume is the one that tests my skills the most.\n\n\u2018For example, on the alien, making sure the head held that elongated shape and was balanced upon his head was a new test for me.\u2019\n\nYep, all done through crocheting (Picture: Crochetverse/Stephanie Pokorny)\n\nBut being the good mum she is, Stephanie doesn\u2019t just go for the easiest thing to make \u2013 she lets her kids use their imagination.\n\n\u2018The actual characters I make are entirely up to my kids,\u2019 she explains. \u2018They get to pick anything.\n\n\u2018We are a family that is very much into vintage and original versions [of films], and with parents of the 80s and 90s, most often it will be characters from them as we watch movies or cartoons of that time.\u2019\n\nEnjoy the rest of Stephanie\u2019s crotchet creations below\n\nWould definitely open the door to this kid on Halloween (Picture: Crochetverse/Stephanie Pokorny)\n\nWe don\u2019t even know how the eyes are glowing (Picture: Crochetverse/Stephanie Pokorny)\n\nE.T, is that you?
