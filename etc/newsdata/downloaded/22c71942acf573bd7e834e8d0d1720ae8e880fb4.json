James Alcock\n\nStill, Apple retains its long-term appeal to the broker.\n\n\u201cOur PO of $US260 is based on approximately 18x our C20E EPS estimate of $US14.53. Our target multiple compares to the long-term historical range of 10 -18x (median 13x). We believe a multiple at the high end of the historical range is justified given a large cash balance and opportunity to diversify into new end markets, increasing mix and diversity of services, and a cyclically low point in iPhone sales.\n\n\u201cUpside risks are: gross margin upside from better mix of higher end iPhones, and tailwind from lower memory costs and lower warranty accruals, a faster than expected recovery in emerging markets, and faster than expected recovery in China App Store sales.\n\n\u201cDownside risks are: potential trade conflicts, tariffs, and a stronger USD. Other risk factors are continuing China weakness, structural decline in iPhone units and longer iPhone replacement cycles, Apple's continued significant exposure to the iPhone, commoditization in the smartphone market, intensifying competition in the tablet market, ability to manage beat and raise expectations for EPS estimates, and requirement to maintain pace of product innovation.\u201d", "description": "Australian shares are trading higher this morning; Bega Cheese shares have fallen heavily after flagging a weak year ahead; RBA governor Philip Lowe speech ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9934%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/bb7cdba56105a8050f3a0664509c777a143d1564", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
