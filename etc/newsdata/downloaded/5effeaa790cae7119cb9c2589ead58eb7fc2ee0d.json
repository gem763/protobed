We grabbed our children and I ran down with my kids and husband,\u201d Nana recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my apartment was ruined. I don\u2019t know anything. I might not have anything anymore.\u201d One woman who lives on the sixth floor of the aparment told reporters that she was unable to see anything as the smoke and flames grew worse. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even breathe, we couldn\u2019t see anything, it was straight pitch-black,\u201d she said.
