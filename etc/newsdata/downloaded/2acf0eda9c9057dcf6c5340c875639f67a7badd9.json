According to Trump, the meetings were secret but he decided to cancel after learning about an attack in Kubal that killed an American soldier.\n\nUnbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n....an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn\u2019t, they.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\n....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019\n\nThe meetings were scheduled for Monday, September 9th, just shy of the 18th anniversary of 9/11. Additional details about the meeting are unknown at this time.\n\nThe Trump administration has spent months negotiating with Taliban leaders in Qatar. U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said a tentative agreement had been the United States and Taliban leaders. The United States would close several bases and remove 5,000 troops over the next five months in exchange for peace, The Hill reported.\n\nThe terrorist group took responsibility for a bombing in Kabul on Monday that killed 12, including one American soldier, which Trump referenced in his tweets.\n\nOne of President Trump's major campaign promises has been to pull troops out of the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking to them. We\u2019re continuing to talk. We\u2019ve been there 19 years,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to get at least a big proportion of them [service members] home,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe also have NATO troops there. We\u2019d like to bring a big portion of them home. So we\u2019re talking to the Taliban; we\u2019re talking to the government. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d", "description": ".09/08/2019 7:37:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/247/ef67a9f4-4c98-4138-aaca-4ce46efae64c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
