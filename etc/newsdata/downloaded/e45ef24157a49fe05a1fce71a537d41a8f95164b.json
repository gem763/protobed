(AP) \u2015 Maryland\u2019s attorney general on Wednesday sued a real estate company once run by President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law over allegedly illegal and harmful rental practices, including the kind of rodent infestations the president has accused Baltimore leaders of failing to address.\n\nAttorney General Brian Frosh announced his office\u2019s Consumer Protection Division has filed charges against New Jersey-based Westminster Management, a subsidiary of the Kushner Cos.\n\nFrosh said there have been \u201cnumerous\u201d violations of consumer protection laws, which harmed thousands of Maryland residents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re charging that Westminster and the rental property owners in this case took advantage of consumers, primarily low- and middle-income families, collecting fees and other unlawful costs from them and often failing to make the repairs needed to maintain suitable environments for their tenants,\u201d said Frosh, a Democrat.\n\nWe allege this company cheated tenants before, during and after their tenancy, violating the Consumer Protection Act thousands of times. https://t.co/6anZeddYgm \u2014 Brian Frosh (@BrianFrosh) October 23, 2019\n\nJared Kushner, a senior adviser to the Republican president, stepped down as CEO of the family business before joining the White House. But he still has an ownership stake in the subsidiary.\n\nLaurent Morali, the president of the Kushner Cos., announced last month that the company rejected a settlement offer from Frosh\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWe refuse to be extorted by an ambitious Attorney General who clearly cares more about scoring political points than fighting real crime and improving the lives of the people of Maryland,\u201d Morali said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe look forward to defending ourselves against these bogus allegations.\u201d\n\nKushner\u2019s family real estate firm owns thousands of apartments and townhomes in the Baltimore area. Some have been criticized for the same kind of disrepair and neglect that Trump has accused local leaders of failing to address, when he referred to Baltimore as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess.\u201d\n\nThe company says it is proud of its Baltimore-area apartments and has invested \u201csubstantial amounts\u201d in upkeep.\n\nThe case filed by Frosh contains administrative charges that will be heard before an administrative law judge.\n\nThe charges allege the company and rental property owners routinely failed to address hazardous conditions in the properties, including rodent and vermin infestations, water leaks and mold growth.\n\nThe case also alleges that Westminster Management and the owners have demanded, collected and retained hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegitimate fees from prospective and actual tenants.\n\nThe company frequently charged additional fees that it never incurred and was not entitled to collect under Maryland law when it filed eviction actions, according to the charges.\n\nThe company allegedly violated the state\u2019s Security Deposit Law by routinely withholding damages from tenants\u2019 security deposits that were not caused by the tenants and were ordinary wear and tear, such as worn carpeting.\n\nThe case also alleges the company engaged in illegal debt collection, because the owners of two Baltimore properties, Dutch Village Apartments and Pleasant View Apartments failed to maintain licenses required to legally rent apartments.", "description": "The attorney general said a real estate company owned by Jared Kushner's family rented out rodent-infested homes and repeatedly cheated Maryland residents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db12ee0210000ae2534ae0a.jpeg?cache=bjcjrmgzex&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
