In a massive setback for the upcoming Telegram Open Network (TON), the regulator has filed an emergency action and restraining order against the two offshore entities behind it. The SEC alleges that the tokens were unlawfully sold \u2014 and claims U.S. markets would have been flooded with the digital currency if nothing was done. As a result of the proceedings, investors will be unable to acquire their Grams. Telegram is accused of failing to provide buyers with information about its business operations, financial condition and risk factors \u2014 disclosures that are required under the Securities Act of 1933. It is believed that about a quarter of the Grams sold \u2014 worth about $425 million \u2014 belonged to 31 purchasers based in the U.S. The official Telegram channel for TON investors has now suggested that the launch, which was scheduled for Oct. 31, could be postponed. In a letter to investors, TON developers claimed they had been seeking feedback from the commission for 18 months, writing:\n\n\u201cWe were surprised and disappointed that the SEC chose to file the lawsuit under these circumstances, and we disagree with the SEC's legal position.\u201d\n\nGet the popcorn in \u2014 it looks like we\u2019re going to have another blockbuster showdown in Washington. Wednesday brought the news that Mark Zuckerberg is going to testify in front of the House of Representatives Financial Committee on Oct. 23. The topic? Yes, you guessed it\u2026 Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin. It\u2019s been another busy week as the tech giant struggles to get the project off the ground. Katie Haun, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, warned of national security implications if the U.S. blocks the digital currency. A crypto derivatives exchange unveiled plans to launch physically delivered futures contracts that will be settled based on whether Libra launches in 2020. Meanwhile, a \u201cvery, very skeptical\u201d finance minister in Germany \u2014 the crown jewel in Europe\u2019s economy \u2014 rejected Libra and said he wants to see an electronic version of the euro instead. As the team at Menlo Park went to reach for the headache pills, it then emerged that Facebook is being sued for trademark infringement because of its Libra logo.\n\nFacebook isn\u2019t the only one facing drama in New York\u2019s courts this week. A legal firm has filed a lawsuit against Tether and Bitfinex, accusing them of market manipulation. The founding partner of Roche Freedman, Kyle Roche, says the class-action lawsuit accuses the stablecoin firm and crypto exchange of defrauding investors, manipulating markets and concealing illicit proceeds. On Twitter, Roche accused the companies of creating the \u201clargest bubble in history\u201d \u2014 with a \u201csophisticated scheme\u201d that was \u201cpart-fraud, part-pump-and-dump and part-money laundering.\u201d The issue of whether Tether tokens (USDT) are fully backed by U.S. dollars is also part of the lawsuit, with Roche claiming the firm \u201cissued extraordinary amounts of unbanked USDT to manipulate cryptocurrency prices.\u201d Both companies have described the allegations as baseless and have vowed to vigorously defend themselves.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has a new chairman \u2014 and this week, we got an insight into his views on cryptocurrencies. Heath Tarbert told a summit that he believes Ether (ETH) is a commodity \u2014 and ETH futures trading is becoming a reality. This is the first time that the authority has provided a vision for Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Tarbert, who replaced J. Christopher Giancarlo in July, also acknowledged that there were not insubstantial levels of uncertainty surrounding the status of altcoins, but he claimed similar digital assets should be treated\u2026 well, similarly. He added: \u201cIf the underlying asset, the original digital asset, hasn\u2019t been determined to be a security and is therefore a commodity, most likely the forked asset will be the same.\u201d\n\nThe Bakkt platform may have gotten off to a rather sluggish start, but new data suggests there may have been a turnaround after its tepid launch. Tracking data by the Bakkt Volume Bot on Twitter revealed that the trading volume of Bitcoin (BTC) futures soared to 224 contracts on Oct. 9 \u2014 a whopping 796% increase on the day before. Gert-Jan Lasterie, the Dutch journalist and crypto author who compiled the data, said the 224 contracts represent an all-time high for the platform. An uptick in demand could be a promising development, not least because Binance Research had said Bakkt\u2019s disappointing performance after launch was a factor in BTC/USD plunging by $2,000.\n\nAlipay has declared that it\u2019s going to ban any transactions related to BTC and other cryptocurrencies. The digital payment arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba warned consumers that it is closely monitoring over-the-counter transactions to identify irregular behavior and ensure it is compliant with relevant regulations. This comes after multiple reports that Alipay is being used for BTC transactions. Also this week, Binance announced it has started accepting fiat currencies through Alipay, as well as the mobile messaging and payment app WeChat.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $8,352.40, Ether at $182.68 and XRP at $0.28. The total market cap is at $225,028,180,891.\n\nThe top three altcoin gainers of the week are Stronghands, Haracoin and CaixaPay. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Goodomy, LogisCoin and BetaCoin.\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s market analysis.\n\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\n\u201cOur emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold.\u201d Stephanie Avakian, the co-director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement\n\n\u201cI would bet that Libra\u2026 let's say, by the end of 2022, I think Libra will not have launched.\u201d Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple CEO\n\n\u201cWe've been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven't said anything about ether \u2014 until now. [...] It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.\u201d Heath Tarbert, CFTC chairman\n\n\u201cFor the record, these psychopaths are still literally and without a shred of irony claiming that they \u2018discovered\u2019 XRP as opposed to having created it.\u201d Nic Carter, Coinmetrics.io co-founder\n\n\u201cWe see blockchain as a big wave that will disrupt finance in the future. We need to be ready for the moment when different types of assets turn into tokens, although we don\u2019t know when that will be.\u201d Lee Woo-yeol, KB Kookmin Bank\n\n\u201cBecause the market believed the lie that one USDT equaled one U.S. dollar, Bitfinex and Tether had the power to, and did, manipulate the market on an unprecedented scale to profit from boom-and-bust cycles they created.\u201d Roche Freedman, New York legal firm\n\n\u201cI think it would be a really dangerous thing, and frankly a dangerous precedent to start shutting down technology before it\u2019s built.\u201d Katie Haun, Andreessen Horowitz partner\n\n\u201cIt is still very complicated to secure funds for institutions that need them readily available. Until this interface problem is not solved, the global adoption of this technology by businesses will not happen.\u201d Pablo Yabo, former chief technology officer for Algo Capital\n\n\u201cPlay with it, don\u2019t expect miracles at first. Play with it until it becomes real.\u201d John McAfee, crypto advocate\n\n\u201cA core element of national sovereignty is currency issuance; we would not leave that to private businesses.\u201d Olaf Scholz, German finance minister\n\n\u201cExchanges are the biggest #HODLers.\u201d The Token Analyst on Twitter\n\nPrediction of the Week\n\nIt\u2019s prediction time \u2014 and this week, we\u2019re focusing on the upcoming Telegram Open Network. Decentral Park Capital believes TON\u2019s value has the potential to surpass $20 billion over the next five years, and its native cryptocurrency, Gram (GRM), could become one of the top 10 protocol assets. The blockchain venture and digital assets fund said TON can help \u201cbank the unbanked\u201d and serve as a gateway for crypto assets. It also believes that TON could become a vital discovery platform for Web 3.0 applications, just like the App Store was in Web 2.0. It might not all be smooth sailing. The report says three major challenges lie ahead: a lack of openness to developers, an unfriendly attitude from local governments, and a potential imbalance between demand and selling pressure. Friday\u2019s emergency action to halt the digital token offering, launched by the SEC, will no doubt put a spanner in the works too.\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nRipple Labs was on the naughty step this week after it said it \u201cdiscovered\u201d rather than created the XRP token \u2014 claims that have been described as misleading. Coinmetrics.io co-founder Nic Carter was among those furious about the company\u2019s remarks, writing: \u201cFor the record, these psychopaths are still literally and without a shred of irony claiming that they \u2018discovered\u2019 XRP as opposed to having created it.\u201d Cory Johnson, a former Bloomberg TV anchor who had worked as Ripple\u2019s chief markets strategist until February 2019, had written: \u201cRipple\u2019s relationship to XRP is akin [to] Chevron\u2019s relationship to oil. We have a lot of it, we believe it\u2019s a superior technology and we support its many uses \u2014 for billions of reasons. But we don\u2019t have all of it, we don\u2019t control it and we aren\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nA Singaporean man has been charged by U.S. prosecutors for using stolen identities to illegally utilize Amazon Web Services cloud computing power for crypto mining. Ho Jun Jia, who used several aliases, allegedly became the company\u2019s largest data consumer. One of the accounts he used belonged to an unnamed Los Angeles-based game developer, and their financial staff were paying some of his bills before the fraud was detected. A man in Texas and an Indian business owner also fell victim. Overall, prosecutors allege he consumed more than $5 million in unpaid cloud computing services with his illicit mining operation. Ho was arrested in late September, and he could be extradited to stand trial in the Seattle Western District Court.\n\nThe FBI is investigating whether a student at the University of Michigan attempted to hack West Virginia\u2019s voting app. The blockchain-based service, known as Voatz, was used to collect ballots from overseas and military voters in the 2018 election. Investigators say the attempt was unsuccessful. West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner has said every safeguard designed for the system worked as planned \u2014 and he stressed that \u201cno votes were altered, impacted, viewed or in any way tampered with.\u201d Nonetheless, plans are now in place to introduce \u201cmore robust security measures and protocols\u201d ahead of 2020.\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\nDeepfakes are Photoshop jobs on steroids \u2014 tech that can manipulate videos to make it look like the subject is saying or doing pretty much anything.
