Caleb Henry was one of them until he quit his job in 2018 because of the constant barrage of trauma he witnessed on the job in California.\n\n\u201cThere are calls that I do not forget,\u201d Henry told HuffPost. \u201cThere are calls that I still think about.\u201d\n\nThe 21-year-old former EMT has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD. After a couple of years of long workdays and nightmarish memories from on-the-job horrors with zero in-house health resources, Henry said the work took a toll on his mental health.\n\n\u201cA 14-year-old girl was walking on the tracks, listening to music and was hit by the train,\u201d Henry said, recalling one assignment that still haunts him. \u201cShe was losing a lot of blood. We did all we could. She died en route to the hospital.\u201d\n\nLong afterward, he said, he found himself \u201creplaying the scene in my mind, obsessively.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go near a train track,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really triggers me.\u201d\n\nIn this profession, mental illness is common. EMTs and paramedics experience higher rates of PTSD, major depression, substance abuse and suicide than the general population, according to scientific studies in the U.S. and England. This high-stress career path also holds increased risks of physical health problems and complications.\n\nFirst responders can run on little sleep during long shifts, faced with graphic scenes and little time \u201cto stop and breathe,\u201d according to Henry. The pressure of life and death hangs over every action.\n\n\u201cAs much as a therapist could tell you that you\u2019re not responsible for someone\u2019s death ... that is your patient,\u201d Henry said. \u201cYou\u2019re making the decisions. They\u2019re your patients. Was it something that I did? Did I make a wrong decision? Did we take too long? There is that responsibility.\u201d\n\nDespite the physical and mental toll of the job, paramedics and EMTs don\u2019t always earn as much as other first responders. Many paramedics juggle multiple jobs because of low pay \u2015 an average of $16.50 an hour in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s 40% less than what the average American earned, Money magazine reported.\n\nIn New York City, for example, they lag behind firefighters in pay and benefits, according to a New York Times editorial published in September.\n\nAs that suggests, the first responder pecking order often leaves EMTs and paramedics overshadowed by police officers and firefighters. In July, President Donald Trump allocated $7.5 million annually for five years for mental health services for police officers, but nothing for paramedics, EMTs or firefighters.\n\nHuffPost Witnessing traumatic events regularly has lasting and recurring effects on the brain.\n\nParts of the brain may not store memories after an emotional or shocking event, said Stephanie Conn, a licensed psychologist who founded First Responder Psychology in Oregon. People may not remember details correctly, or they may feel like the event is ongoing \u2014 resending and replaying terrifying images over and over. The amygdala, the region of the brain associated with emotional processes, goes into hyperdrive. Adrenaline makes the images more vivid and frightening. And brain scans show the hippocampus, associated with memory formation, shrinks with chronic exposure to trauma.\n\nRegular exposure compounds the problems.\n\n\u201cIt keeps sending them those images when they\u2019re asleep, in their waking areas,\u201d Conn said. \u201cWhen they go home to see their kid at the end of the shift, they\u2019ll see the face of the kid that died in an accident earlier that day.\u201d\n\nThe traumatized brain, she continued, \u201cstarts to see danger even when it doesn\u2019t exist. Certain parts of the brain shrink \u2014 it\u2019s like a muscle \u2014 and it will create more problems if [the hippocampus] keeps getting shut down.\u201d\n\nConn knows the pressures of being a first responder well. She was a police officer for nine years, has been married to a cop for about 20 years, and her father was an officer for 40 years. She saw a gap in mental health care available to first responders and decided to fill it.\n\nIf they received a diagnosis of cancer, they would tell their closest people and do their research and the same should be true of any kind of mental health. Stephanie Conn, licensed psychologist and founder of First Responder Psychology\n\nConn\u2019s First Responder Psychology offers trauma-informed training for organizations that teaches how to develop healthy habits. It includes work-life balance guidance and coaching on how to begin and lead peer support programs. Employees can learn how to beat burnout and traumatic stress, and employers are taught how to address these issues by adopting proactive and reactive strategies to take care of workers.\n\nThe first responder advocacy group Code Green Campaign also casts the mental health crisis as a fixable problem that is the responsibility of employers.\n\nAnne-Marie Farina, the co-founder of the Code Green Campaign, worked in many roles in emergency medicine, including paramedic, a wildfire medic, and a volunteer firefighter. After confiding in other first responders after the suicide of a co-worker, Farina said she realized many of her counterparts have had friends and co-workers who\u2019ve died by suicide.\n\n\u201cThere is no way this is a coincidence,\u201d Farina told herself.\n\nFarina\u2019s organization counsels emergency response groups on keeping their employees healthy, and advises them how to prevent suicide and handle \u201cpostvention\u201d in the case of a suicide attempt.\n\nCode Green argues that employers must make sure resources are culturally aware, affordable and easily accessible. Without ways to manage the unique demands of the job, Farina said of paramedics and EMTs, \u201cthey\u2019re gonna be burned out and then they\u2019re gonna quit.\u201d\n\nHuffPost Stephanie Conn, licensed psychologist and founder of First Responder Psychology, says employers must ensure their workers have open access to health care.\n\nAs an EMT, Henry remembers how he was unable to show his emotions or honest reactions to a traumatic scene, on the job or afterward. Though he did seek comfort talking with co-workers, he didn\u2019t totally feel supported in the work environment.\n\n\u201cShowing any sign of weakness, you\u2019re gonna get berated for it,\u201d Henry said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get shut down.\u201d\n\nThe way to fix a broken cycle of deteriorating mental health, Farina said, is for EMS agencies to reduce the stigma around mental illness, and provide education and support in recognizing and addressing the signs and symptoms of problems. Learning and talking, she said, are vital to changing a culture often discourages both.\n\n\u201cHelping the managers talk to employees in a way that is meaningful and actually productive \u2014 that\u2019s something we\u2019ve looked into for stigma reduction,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we talk about wanting to break the stigma down, we want to be a voice for people and bridge the gap between the field employees and management.\u201d\n\nIf you are a first responder and need help immediately, contact SafeCallNow at 206-459-3020 or Frontline Helpline at 1-866-676-7500.
