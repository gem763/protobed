It's met its match in Trump", "language": "en", "text": "Not even Donald Trump can make the United Nations great again. It was never great in the first place. On the other hand, President Trump has begun the long-overdue work to make the U.N. better than it has ever been.\n\nPresidents before Trump tried to reform the U.N., but their mistake was trying to do so from the inside, playing by the unfair rules of an entrenched bureaucracy. American officials patiently sat on committees and councils, bit their tongue while tyrants and outlaws thumbed their nose at the international community, and spoke in the flowery, phony rhetoric of elite diplomacy. Meanwhile, the organization rotted from the inside out.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s founding principles of peace, freedom, and equal rights are universally hailed. But in practice, they have been subordinated to the U.N.\u2019s own institutional power and interests.\n\nSUPREME COURT COULD HEAR GROUNDBREAKING CASE THAT CHALLENGES UN IMMUNITY\n\nThough the United States has always funded the lion\u2019s share of the U.N.\u2019s budget, the U.N. bureaucracy sees America as the chief obstacle to their long term goals. As obnoxious as this sounds, they are not wrong.\n\nThe United States is a fiercely independent, confident nation that resists being told what to do \u2013 and therefore, we are the chief obstacle to their long term goals of ever greater globalization and centralization of power.\n\nThe U.N. fancies itself as a super-national government-in-waiting for the post-national world. The American people\u2019s response to that smug attitude\u2026 is a red MAGA hat. Cue the outrage at U.N. headquarters.\n\nUnable to bully the United States, then, the U.N. often turns its sneer to one of our closest and most vulnerable allies: Israel. It is entirely possible to criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic. Unfortunately, the U.N. can\u2019t even meet that low bar of civilized engagement. Indeed, the U.N. seems to get a perverse thrill from condemning Israel without even a veneer of impartiality.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOver the years, the U.N.\u2019s Human Rights Council has included representatives from monstrous regimes in China, Cuba, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia, among others. Yet these regimes routinely get a pass from the U.N.\u2019s watch-dogs, while Israel has been singled out for condemnation more than 70 times.\n\nJust this past summer, the U.N.\u2019s Economic and Social Council passed a resolution declaring Israel \u2013 Israel, a democracy with open elections and the rule of law \u2013 the world\u2019s only violator of woman\u2019s and human rights. Talk about fake news.\n\nThe UN\u2019s uniquely toxic culture thrives on the subtle curlicues and faux-sophistication of diplomatic niceties. The president knows that the truth is more powerful than all the ambassadors and commissions and councils in the world \u2013 and is the only foundation for the peace, freedom, and equality the United Nations was created to serve.\n\nRather than try to compete in the U.N.\u2019s rigged game, the Trump administration changed the rules. In 2018, President Trump\u2019s U.N. Ambassador (and former South Carolina governor) Nikki Haley publicly withdrew from the sham Human Rights Council. On her way out, she attacked the Council for being \u201ca protector of human rights abusers and a cesspool of political bias.\u201d\n\nThe organization is so corrupt \u2013 so warped by anti-Americanism, anti-Semitism, and hypocrisy \u2013 that it needs to be disinfected before it can be fixed. That\u2019s where Donald Trump\u2019s blunt, bracing style comes in.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe UN\u2019s uniquely toxic culture thrives on the subtle curlicues and faux-sophistication of diplomatic niceties.
