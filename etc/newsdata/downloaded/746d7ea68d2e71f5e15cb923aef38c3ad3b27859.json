The couple had previously been convicted of a similar crime in Norway, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe suitcases were brought to Lisbon from the Caribbean island of St Lucia and were found inside the couple\u2019s cruise cabin. The judge said the couple was \u201cfully aware\u201d the cocaine was inside the suitcases.\n\nHolding hands and crying, the couple, who claim they were tricked into smuggling the drugs, said they want people to know the \u201creal story\u201d but did not make any further declarations to reporters.\n\nTheir lawyer, Susana Paisana, told reporters she would consider appealing the sentence but that, for now, the couple would remain in jail in Lisbon. The court did not find any reason why they should be expelled from Portugal to the UK.\n\n\u201cThe transnational nature of organised drugs networks makes international collaboration essential, and the NCA works with partners around the world to coordinate action, disrupt drug-smuggling networks and prevent illegal drugs reaching the UK in the first place,\u201d the agency\u2019s deputy director international, Tom Dowdall, said.\n\n\u201cIn this case, through our international network, we were able to share intelligence with our Portuguese colleagues, leading to the recovery of a significant quantity of cocaine and the arrest of two suspected smugglers.\n\n\u201cOrganised crime groups rely on couriers such as the Clarkes to move their product across international borders. While their role might seem small, they provide a crucial link in a chain which causes violence and exploitation in source countries and on the streets of the UK.\u201d", "description": "Roger and Sue Clarke found with nine kilos of cocaine on cruise ship in Lisbon", "authors": ["Kevin Rawlinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb1e4945e876391ff80153bf4211904f3acb4f0/1349_846_1530_918/master/1530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4307f56d01196f9d76348b10587602b7", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
