Economists said this was behind the surprise jump in credit card usage in July.\n\nThe numbers: Consumer borrowing picked up in July at the fastest rate in almost two years, according to Federal Reserve data released Monday. Total consumer credit increased $23.3 billion. That\u2019s an annual growth rate of 6.8%, up from a 4.1% rate in the prior month. That\u2019s the fastest pace since November 2017. Economists had been expecting a $16 billion gain, according to Econoday.\n\nWhat happened: Revolving credit, such as credit cards, surged 11.2% in July, after falling 0.2% in June. That\u2019s also the highest rate in 20 months. Nonrevolving credit, typically auto and student loans, rose 5.3% in July. The data does not include mortgage loans.\n\nBig picture: Economists are directing all of their attention to the health of the consumer, with business spending faltering in the face of global weakness and trade tensions. The strong labor market and rising wages have kept spending at a solid pace this year. But talk of recession could turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy if consumers pull back.\n\nWhat are they saying? \u201cJuly included Amazon\u2019s Prime Day...we suspect this drove the surprise jump in revolving debt,\u201d said T.J. Connelly, head of research at Contingent Macro Research.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% rose slightly Monday as investors are awaiting central bank decisions in the next 10 days.
