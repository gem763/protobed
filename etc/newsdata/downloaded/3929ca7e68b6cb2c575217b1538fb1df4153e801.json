In the political world, UK MPs recently endorsed the Labour party\u2019s declaration of a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d.\n\nThe scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world\u2019s scientists. In October, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth.\n\nOther terms that have been updated, including the use of \u201cwildlife\u201d rather than \u201cbiodiversity\u201d, \u201cfish populations\u201d instead of \u201cfish stocks\u201d and \u201cclimate science denier\u201d rather than \u201cclimate sceptic\u201d. In September, the BBC accepted it gets coverage of climate change \u201cwrong too often\u201d and told staff: \u201cYou do not need a \u2018denier\u2019 to balance the debate.\u201d\n\nEarlier in May, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has inspired school strikes for climate around the globe, said: \u201cIt\u2019s 2019. Can we all now call it what it is: climate breakdown, climate crisis, climate emergency, ecological breakdown, ecological crisis and ecological emergency?\u201d", "description": "From now, house style guide recommends terms such as \u2018climate crisis\u2019 and \u2018global heating\u2019", "authors": ["Damian Carrington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7d69f88dcbbfbfde9258a807c6ea2880c78186/0_264_3295_1978/master/3295.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=979b976291021438630304d2a0727224", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
