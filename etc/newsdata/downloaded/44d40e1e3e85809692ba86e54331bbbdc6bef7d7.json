A Treasury spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBondholders are also likely to compare notes with what they heard on a conference call last week with former deputy economy minister Emmanuel \u00c1lvarez Agis, who is now on opposition presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez's team.\n\nAccording to one bondholder that participated in the call, which was attended by around 15 major debt and hedge funds, \u00c1lvarez Agis said a Fernandez government would prefer to deal directly with bondholders in future negotiations.\n\nLacunza will also have meetings with IMF officials and the World Bank, according to a spokesman. He will be joined by several other Argentine officials, including the head of the central bank, Guido Sandleris.", "description": "Argentina bondholders to meet treasury minister in New York", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8M1QH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
