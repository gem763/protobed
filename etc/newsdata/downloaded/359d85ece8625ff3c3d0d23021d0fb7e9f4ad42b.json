Under the process, the Department of Energy assesses the applications and provides recommendations to the EPA, which makes a final decision.\n\nSince Trump took office, the EPA has vastly expanded its use of the exemptions, providing waivers to small facilities owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-epa-icahn/exclusive-u-s-epa-grants-biofuels-waiver-to-billionaire-icahns-oil-refinery-sources-idUSKBN1I10YB and by oil majors like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-exxon-mobil-exclusive/exclusive-exxon-mobil-secured-u-s-hardship-waiver-from-biofuels-laws-sources-idUSKCN1OI292 and Chevron Corp (NYSE: ) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-chevron-exclusive/exclusive-chevron-granted-waiver-from-u-s-biofuel-laws-at-utah-plant-source-idUSKCN1NP2E6, according to Reuters reporting.\n\nUnder pressure over the most recent round of 31 waivers, Trump last month promised a \u201cgiant package\u201d to farmers to boost the market for ethanol. That plan has yet to be released.", "description": "Exclusive: U.S. EPA granted full biofuel waivers to refineries over Energy Dept advice: memo", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N17R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
