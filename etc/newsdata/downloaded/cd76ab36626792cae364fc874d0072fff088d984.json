Let's assume she was that traumatized by the event. What do you have? A pack of lies. Please consider Blasey Ford's Kavinaugh Testimony Unravels After Ex-Boyfriend Refutes Key Claims. Yes, I believe Ford's accuser. Why? Unlike Ford, her accuser genuinely has nothing to gain.\n\nHe cites specific instances that are likely verifiable including an apartment where Ford lived that was 500 sq. ft.\n\nHe accuses her of credit card fraud. This should be easy enough to verify.\n\nFord's testimony about installing a second door on an apartment as an escape hatch has already been blown to smithereens. It turns out that the second door was likely put in to accommodate tenants that Ford leased a portion of her home to. Redacted Letter BREAKING: Fox\u2019s @johnrobertsFox obtains letter from Ford ex-boyfriend alleging: dated for 6 yrs, never told of sex assault, Ford coached friend on taking polygraph, flew frequently w/o expressing any fear of flying/tight spaces/limited exits.

However, one can drive a truck through the holes in Ford's memory.\n\nThere's more.\n\nNEW: SenGrassley sends letter to Ford legal team asking for therapy notes (WaPo says some provided to them), all recordings of polygraph, all communications Ford had w/ WaPo. #Kavanaugh pic.twitter.com/N9u4FkDBiS \u2014 Shannon Bream (@ShannonBream) October 3, 2018\n\nJust fyi, here's the part of the testimony regarding Ford and her attestation that she never helped anyone with tips or advice on how to take a polygraph: https://t.co/WxuXZxlU6i \u2014 stevemur (@stevemur) October 3, 2018\n\nProof? There Is None\n\nNone of this \"proves\" anything. Allegations never prove anything.\n\nBut if one is to believe Ford on the flimsiest of evidence, then we may as well believe evidence that is far more believable to start with.\n\nThat aside, I would rather the FBI investigation go on further.\n\nIf the FB can prove Ford flew in prop planes, attempted to cheat her former boyfriend on credit cards, put in a door to provide a private entrance for tenants, or gave polygraph advice to friends, then we can properly discard her entire slimy testimony.\n\nMy Current Position: Ford Told Outright Lies\n\nI am willing to take a position that Ford is indeed a liar, perhaps coaxed by or intentionally setup by Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThat is my take, but I could be wrong.\n\nBear in mind, it's still possible, that even if her former boyfriend's allegations can be proven, that Ford really believes she was attacked.\n\nI still give her the benefit of the doubt on that point.\n\nApprove Kavanaugh?\n\nIf Ford told outright lies, does that mean the Senate should approve Kavanaugh?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt seems likely, even to me, that Kavanaugh was not 100% truthful in his responses either.\n\nBut wasn't that what it was all about in the first place?\n\nThere was never any intent (by either side actually), to uncover the facts. If the facts do come out, it may be by accident, more than anything else.\n\nVote Now? Why?\n\nThere is new evidence to consider, and most of it suggests Ford is an outright liar.\n\nLet's check out Ford's former boyfriend's story. Maybe its a lie. Maybe the FBI can verify at least parts of it.\n\nIf so, that is the best for Kavanaugh. If not, that is the best for Ford.\n\nI stated my beliefs, but I am willing to change my mind. Most aren't.\n\nMeanwhile, I would rather let the FBI finish its job.\n\nWhat I Suggest\n\nDeclare the Allegation Period Over. Everyone has had a chance to speak. If they failed to do so, it's their own fault. We need to do this or the alleged search for the truth can last a decade. Investigate all the substantial claims. That 100 people believe Ford or 100 people believe Kavanaugh is not a substantial claim\n\nThat is the best process to vindicate Kavanaugh or vindicate Ford without risking the process drag on forever.\n\nKavanaugh Concerns\n\nAt the same time, there are legitimate concerns that Kavanaugh was not entirely truthful.\n\nYet, I wonder if you would be, I would be, or anyone else would be under Senate interrogation of what we did or said in high school or college.\n\nWe are now discussing the meaning of \"boofed\" and \"Devil's Triangle\".\n\nI had to look those terms up. I never heard of either term, nor did anyone I asked.\n\nDid Kavanaugh answer truthfully? How the hell would I know?\n\nDid he drink more than he stated? I will go out on a limb here and say \"probably\".\n\nDid he \"black out\"? I never saw anyone black out from drinking so I suspect not. But how the hell would I know?\n\nUgliness in Eyes of Beholder\n\nMore importantly, is any of this really relevant NOW? Ugliness is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nIt never should have come to this.\n\nBut it did. On purpose.
