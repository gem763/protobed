He said he had invited Mr Fernandez to the presidential palace on Monday to discuss an orderly transition, seen as essential for Argentina's shaky economy and markets.\n\nMr Fernandez, speaking afterwards alongside running mate Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, said he would meet Mr Macri and collaborate with the outgoing leader \"in any way we can\".\n\n\"The times ahead are not easy,\" he told cheering supporters at his election party. \"But of course we will collaborate in everything we can, because the only thing that concerns us is that Argentines stop suffering once and for all.\"\n\nRaucous crowds cheered at Mr Fernandez's election headquarters, with the mood far more muted across the city at Mr Macri's election camp, even though his \"Together for Change\" coalition performed much more strongly than many polls had expected.\n\n\"This resounding victory in the first round is a very clear expression of the Argentine people,\" said Felipe Sol\u00e1, one of Fernandez's closest advisers with the \"Front for All\" party.\n\nA candidate needs 45% of the vote, or 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, to avoid a second round.\n\nMr Fernandez had been the heavy favourite since winning a landslide victory in primaries in August. He extended that lead in pre-election opinion polls.\n\n\"Alberto has won it and I am super happy. We spent four very hard years,\" Paola Fiore, a 35-year-old public employee, told Reuters at Fernandez's election base. \"The excitement and expectations we have are because we know that a government that thinks about the people is back.\"\n\nThe vote will have far-reaching implications. Argentina is one of the world's top grain exporters, is stirring the energy world with its huge Vaca Muerta shale field and is on the cusp of restructuring talks with creditors over $100 billion in debt.\n\nPolling stations closed at 6 pm on Sunday. Soon afterwards, Argentine media quickly started to call the election in Mr Fernandez's favour, although with few details about the size of his lead.\n\n\"I voted for Fernandez because I see people just very unhappy in the street and I want a country with a better economy and more social support,\" Carlos Berenguer, 71, said outside a polling station in the district of Palermo in Buenos Aires.\n\nMacri supporter Jos\u00e9 Luis Salom\u00f3n, the mayor of farming town Saladillo, said: \"What's in play in this election are simply two opposing views of the country.\"\n\nMr Fernandez, a relative unknown outside Argentine political circles until this year, held a 20-point lead in most opinion polls after thumping Mr Macri in the August primary. Markets had been rattled after the primary as investors feared a populist political shift.\n\nThe primary result - and the market crash that followed - sharply altered the dynamic of the race, pushing the country further into economic crisis and making Mr Macri the underdog in an election that most had thought would be a closely fought battle.\n\nFormer President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and running mate of presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez celebrates after election results in Buenos Aires Credit: Reuters More", "description": "Argentina's Peronists swept back into power on Sunday, ousting conservative president Mauricio Macri in an election result that shifts Latin America's No. 3 economy firmly back toward the left after it was battered by economic crisis.
