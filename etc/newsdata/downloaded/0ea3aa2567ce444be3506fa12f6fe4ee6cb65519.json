He keeps really busy. The two-time author is releasing his third book, \"Where I Come From: Life Lessons from a Latino Chef,\" October 1 and he's also a part-owner of the Mexican restaurant Johnny S\u00e1nchez. Used to being on the road for months at a time, S\u00e1nchez recently partnered with Airbnb for Work, which has made it easier for him to feel more at home with his family when he's away.\n\nS\u00e1nchez told Insider his best cooking tip for when you're on the road, about a celebrity run-in with Charlize Theron that caught him off-guard, and what Gordon Ramsay is really like.\n\n1. Your new book is called \"Where I Come From: Life Lessons from a Latino Chef.\" What is one of the biggest life lessons you've learned?\n\nWork hard, never take shortcuts and always stay curious.\n\nS\u00e1nchez mentors a contestant on \"MasterChef.\" He says it's been one of his favorite experiences on TV because of the time he gets to spend with the contestants. Greg Gayne/Fox\n\n2. What is your go-to meal to cook?\n\nA simple quesadilla when I'm tired or a whole roasted chicken when friends or family are coming over.\n\n3. What is your best tip for cooking on the road?\n\nAlways get fresh herbs and spices from wherever you are and bring a few versatile tools with you such as a good knife, cutting board, and a molcajete or mortar and pastel.\n\nSanchez is seen visiting a local market in Los Angeles during a business trip with his uncle. Courtesy Airbnb\n\n4. What's the most overrated food trend right now \u2014 the thing you see on a menu that makes you roll your eyes?\n\nFusion. I generally say fusion leads to confusion.\n\n5. What is the best thing you've ever cooked that you're most proud of?\n\nI cooked for the Obamas at the White House and that was pretty cool. My mom also cooked for Reagan at the White House so it was kind of a cool legacy thing.\n\n6. Who do you admire most in your field and why?\n\nI have to say Gordon [Ramsay] is one of the people in my life that I look up to the most. He's a really hard worker, holds himself to the same high standards he holds others, and he's an incredible family man.\n\nAaron Sanchez can be seen critiquing a dish on \"MasterChef Jr.\" with Gordon Ramsay and Christina Tosi. FOX\n\n7. What is Gordon Ramsay really like in person?\n\nHe's actually lovely. You know he's a family man. He just had his fifth child, and he is so sweet. He has very high standards, but so long as you do what you need to do, he's the absolute best and a really great mentor.\n\nS\u00e1nchez can be seen with \"MasterChef\" judges Joe Bastianich and Gordon Ramsay as the show went to London this season. Matt Frost/FOX\n\n8. What has been your favorite cooking series to be a part of \u2014 \"Iron Chef,\" \"MasterChef,\" \"MasterChef Jr.\", \"Chopped,\" \"Chopped Jr.\" \u2014 and why?\n\n\"MasterChef\" and \"MasterChef Jr.\" have honestly been my favorites because we get so long with the contestants and can truly mentor them. The other shows, we only got a day or two with them, and this just feels like they get so much out of it whether they win or not.\n\n9. Who is the last person who gave you a really good piece of advice and what was it?\n\nChef Paul Prudhomme. He taught me that pairing proteins with what that animal is supposed to eat is the best way to reintroduce the terrain in a natural way.\n\n10. What is the greatest source of inspiration from another country you've found for your cooking?\n\nI love Southeast Asian flavors and cooking techniques. Cooking in a wok has always mesmerized me and I really like the way everything is so evenly cooked and seasoned.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has lived with and cooked with his uncle for the past decade.

What is the hardest thing about living in another location for six months at a time?\n\nOne of the hardest things is having to bring everything with me that I'll need and having to anticipate that, so that's why I love staying in Airbnbs. Staying in a home allows me to cook and have a private space to relax and they have all the things I need that I may have left at home. It's all just very seamless and private and feels as though everything has been thought out and taken care of for me, which is just such a luxury.\n\nS\u00e1nchez and his uncle walk out of the Airbnb where he was staying while in Los Angeles.

What is your advice to someone who is doing this or wants to try it out?\n\nI love staying at Airbnbs because it makes life on the road so much more comfortable. I get to really unwind and have a comfortable space for me and my family to relax and enjoy our time together when I'm not working. I love that I can have a couple bedrooms for guests and family members to come stay and that we usually get a backyard and a barbecue so it feels like I'm back home.\n\n13. Who is the most important person in your life and why?\n\nMy son. He is my reason for getting up in the morning and why I always strive to be the best version of myself.\n\n14. Have you ever been mistaken for another celebrity? If so, who was it?\n\nI actually was mistaken for Cesar Millan, the dog whisperer, while at a dog training class.\n\nDo you see a resemblance between S\u00e1nchez and Millan?

I was so confused at first, but it was an honor.\n\n16. What's the last show you binged?\n\n\"True Detective.\" I love stuff like that and it's based in Louisiana so I got super into it.", "description": "The celebrity chef also gets honest with Insider about his biggest cooking tips on the road and the most overrated food trend right now.", "authors": ["Kirsten Acuna"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d2d1721214c105958067f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
