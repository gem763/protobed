That is finally set to change after the company goes public.\n\nWeWork's parent company said in a filing Wednesday that Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei will join the board upon completion of its public offering. The We Company filed paperwork last month to go public, which quickly set off a wave of press coverage about the absence of any women on its board.\n\nWithin one year of its public offering, The We Company also plans to add an additional board member with the goal of increasing \"the board's gender and ethnic diversity,\" according to the filing.\n\nFrei is a technology and operations management professor who is known for joining Uber with the goal of improving its internal culture during a period of extraordinary turmoil at the company . She served as senior vice president of leadership and strategy at Uber for less than a year before leaving in February 2018 to return to her work at Harvard.\n\n\"I was super attracted to going to an organization that was metaphorically, and perhaps quite literally, on fire,\" Frei said about Uber in a 2018 TED talk shortly after leaving the company. \"I had read everything that was written in the newspaper and that was precisely what drew me to the organization.
