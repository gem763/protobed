None of those three sought reelection.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s acquittal, he was denied his party\u2019s presidential nomination. Nixon and Clinton were in their second terms already and could not run for reelection.\n\nTrump, however, is already doing so.\n\nAs a scholar of American legal and political history, I have studied the precedents for dealing with this strange conundrum. A little-known wrinkle in the Constitution might allow Trump to be reelected president in 2020 even if he is removed from office through the impeachment process.\n\nThe constitutional framework\n\nAt the time the Constitution was ratified in 1788, many of its authors regarded impeachment as an improvement over the violent methods often used in Europe to get rid of corrupt rulers. Nonetheless, they recognized the dangers that impeachment would always present.\n\nAs if commenting on the current moment, Alexander Hamilton noted in 1788, that it will \u201cagitate the passions of the whole community, and \u2026 divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases, it will connect itself with preexisting factions and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or the other.\u201d\n\nThe Founders were careful about defining and regulating this dangerous power. They gave the House of Representatives \u201cthe sole Power of Impeachment,\u201d and specified that the Senate \u201cshall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments,\u201d with a two-thirds majority required for conviction. They specifically prevented the president\u2019s pardon power from reversing impeachments.\n\nThey also limited the possible punishments that the Senate may impose to \u201cremoval from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\u201d But they only required that an impeached and convicted official \u201cbe removed from office\u201d \u2013 but did not mandate that the person also be disqualified from holding a future office.\n\nNowhere does the Constitution define the standards for disqualification. Moreover, the Senate has declined to establish a standard.\n\nBut, as Ohio State University law professor William Foley points out, Senate procedures require separate votes to convict someone of an impeachable offense and to impose a disqualification penalty.\n\nSo even if President Trump were impeached and convicted, there is the possibility that he could be reelected to the same office from which he had been removed.\n\nImpeachment and disqualification\n\nOf the 17 historic impeachment proceedings brought against judges and other officials who rank lower than president, 14 went to trial in the Senate and eight resulted in a guilty verdict.\n\nIn only three of those cases did the Senate bar \u2013 or \u201cdisqualify\u201d \u2013 those who were convicted from holding office in the future.\n\nFirst was West H. Humphreys, a federal district judge from Tennessee at the start of the Civil War, who refused to hold court and announced his support for the Confederacy. He was impeached and disqualified on charges of neglecting his judicial duties and waging war against the government of the United States.\n\nIn 1913, Robert W. Archbald, an associate judge of the United States Commerce Court, was convicted of the more prosaic offense of doing business with litigants before his court, and forever barred from holding office. The Senate found that he \u201cwillfully, unlawfully, and corruptly took advantage of his official position.\u201d\n\nThe third instance of removal and disqualification occurred in 2010. In that case, Congressman Adam Schiff, now one of the key players in the Trump impeachment hearings, took the lead in prosecuting Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. of Louisiana. Porteous was found guilty of receiving cash from lawyers who had dealings in his court, of fraudulent dealings with creditors and of misleading the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.", "description": "While there have been demands for the impeachment of\u00a0many presidents, just three previous ones \u2013\u00a0Andrew Johnson,\u00a0Richard Nixon\u00a0and\u00a0Bill Clinton\u00a0\u2013 have faced formal impeachment inquiries, and the Senate convicted none of them.", "authors": ["Austin Sarat"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WTWDQzpnReTT79pCqYP_PA--~B/aD00MDQ7dz03MjU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d1664790-df11-11e9-bb6f-ef087b99bcc2", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
