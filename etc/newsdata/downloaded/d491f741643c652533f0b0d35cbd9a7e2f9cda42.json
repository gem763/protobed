She told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch that as our lives have sped up, there's \"something about the analogue era\" that appeals to people.\n\n\"It's also a way of coping with the \u2026 progress going on \u2014 to slow it down,\" said Niemeyer, a professor at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al and author of Media and Nostalgia: Yearning for the Past, Present and Future.\n\nThe show about six 20-something people in New York started in 1994 and ran for 10 years. According to industry figures, it's the second-most watched show on Netflix. That popularity has prompted AT&T, which owns the rights to Friends, to end its deal with the online streaming giant. AT&T intends to put the sitcom on its own service, HBO Max, when it launches next year.\n\nThe One Where We Have To Say Goodbye.<br><br>We\u2019re sorry to see Friends go to Warner's streaming service at the beginning of 2020 (in The US). Thanks for the memories, gang \u2615 \u2014@netflix\n\nNiemeyer said that nostalgia has always made money, but that \"there's something deeper-rooted in the nostalgia boom today.\"\n\nShe thinks that even though the internet has increased our ability to connect to one another, the virtual world can feel insular and lonely.\n\n\"There's also nostalgia about: what was a friendship before the world wide web arrived?\"\n\nBob Thompson, director of the Bleier Centre for Television & Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said that \"there is something so quaint and charming to watching friends who are friends by actually physically being in the same space with one another.\"\n\n\"There are telephones in Friends, but there are no cellphones,\" said Thompson.\n\nFriends is the second-most watched show on Netflix, according to industry figures. (Paul Sakuma/The Associated Press)\n\nSome depictions unacceptable today\n\nThat said, Thompson does believe the show has aged badly in some respects.\n\nHe cited episodes where the character Monica was shown in flashback as being very overweight in high school.\n\nThe actress Courtney Cox wore a fat suit in those episodes, which Thompson said portrayed \"the idea of a larger body type being something that it is the American dream to overcome.\"\n\nThere are also depictions around gender and race that would not be acceptable today, he said, as well as a \"total lack of diversity.\"\n\nDespite this, he said he can see why the show remains popular, even just as something to turn on as background noise.\n\n\"It is a meticulously written, funny show with some really hilarious performances,\" he told Lynch.\n\n\"We have to \u2026 at the same time be cognizant of the fact that this is a reflection of a time that we hope we have evolved beyond.\"\n\nLeBlanc, left, and Schwimmer are pictured in Friends, which began in 1994. (Friends/NBC)\n\nMore room for nostalgia nowadays\n\nWhile there seems to be a boom in nostalgia these days, Thompson said it's always been a big part of the human experience.\n\n\"I am sure there were people in caves, thinking back of the glorious days before we invented fire,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said \"the reason we're getting more of this than we ever did before is there is so much more real estate for it to move in on.\"\n\nThe '90s was kind of the last pure decade of stuff that we all watched at the same time, and everybody knew about it. - Bob Thompson\n\nThere used to be just three TV networks with 22 hours of programming per week, he said.\n\n\"Now we've got \u2026 twice as many broadcast networks; all of these cable channels doing original programming; and Netflix, which seems to be releasing a new show every five minutes.\"\n\nHowever, he thinks this appetite for re-watching old shows won't last forever because we don't consume TV in the same way anymore.\n\n\"The '90s was kind of the last pure decade of stuff that we all watched at the same time, and everybody knew about it,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why I think '90s nostalgia has a certain value to it.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
