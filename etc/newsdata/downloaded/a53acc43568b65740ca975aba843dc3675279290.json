The Mamelodi Sundowns schemer has suffered yet another career-threatening injury, this time snapping an Achilles tendon that will require surgery to repair \u2013 with possibly a long spell on the sidelines.\n\nHowever, the player from Mohlakeng township in Randfontein on the West Rand, will find comfort in the words of his coach Pitso Mosimane.\n\n\u201cOupa knows that at Sundowns we don\u2019t say \u2018wena go fedile\u2019 [it\u2019s over] \u2013 we support our players,\u201d Mosimane told City Press.\n\nManyisa broke down midway through the first half of the Shell Helix Ultra Cup against Kaizer Chiefs last weekend.\n\n\u201cCuthbert Malajila had long-term injuries but we stayed with him. When was the last time [Anthony] Laffor played? He\u2019s forever out [injured] every year for six to seven months but when he comes out, he\u2019s a different player.\u201d\n\nMosimane classified Manyisa among those he believes were simply unlucky with injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine line whether you\u2019re unlucky or injury-prone. With Oupa and Riva [Rivaldo Coetzee] sometimes it\u2019s bad luck.\n\n\u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to live on luck. I also believe [that] if you work hard on your body, you are less likely to get injured. So you\u2019ve got to strengthen weak muscles. There\u2019s no better example than NBA players, who play every two days in addition to long travel but they are forever in the gym,\u201d said Mosimane, an ardent fan of NBA\u2019s Western Conference side Golden State Warriors.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day when you sum it up, football is a professional sport that is linked with injuries because it\u2019s a high intensity game. Players are talking about \u2018thanks God, I hope I don\u2019t get injured this year\u2019.\u201d Mosimane added that coaches were part of the training programme and warned that \u201cif you overload [players] then they\u2019ll get injuries\u201d.\n\nChiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has also had a fair share of setbacks in his squad. The German said this week that utility player Joseph Molangoane won\u2019t play a competitive game anytime soon.\n\nMolangoane has endured an injury-ravaged four years with two leg breaks in that period. Keeper Itumeleng Khune has also been injury-prone.\n\nSometimes, the age factor comes into play when comparing the nature and severity of injuries in players. Renowned sports physician Dr Ephraim Nematswerani has done extensive research on this and provided extracts from some of his articles published in The SA Journal of Sports Medicine in September 2005.\n\n\u201cOlder professional soccer players are significantly more likely to sustain an injury than younger players,\u201d noted Nematswerani, who at the time was a team doctor for Moroka Swallows, the SA Under-23s as well as a medical officer for Team SA for multicoded games.\n\n\u201cThis study also found that the older players sustained a higher percentage of more severe injuries, while the younger players were more likely to have slight injuries that did not result in long time off training or competition.\u201d\n\nHowever, there have been cases where players\u2019 setbacks have set them up for a greater comeback. One such case is that of former Orlando Pirates defender Benson Mhlongo.\n\nA horrific knee injury in 2009 sidelined him for nine months but he bounced back in a spectacular way, helping the now defunct Platinum Stars win two cups in 2013 \u2013 the MTN8 and the Telkom Knockout.\n\nOn the international front, world football is still in awe on how former Arsenal ace Santi Cazorla has resurrected his career at Villarreal in La Liga after two years on the sidelines.\n\nThe Spaniard was almost confined to the scrap heap after an infection ate into his Achilles tendon.\n\nCazorla, who turns 35 in December, scooped player of the season on his comeback last season and, even more remarkably, he was recalled to represent Spain in May, three-and-a-half-years since his last appearance in the national team.\n\nSimilarly, Coetzee has been fighting his way back to the top and he was on the cusp of a Bafana return at the Afcon but he withdrew from the provisional squad to attend to a family matter.", "description": "As much as injuries are part of football, certain players just seem to be more injury-prone, while others are followed by bad luck, writes Daniel Mothowagae.", "authors": ["Daniel Mothowagae"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9376/ea959aa75c0f4eca837a152b8f57ebf2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
