The magazine would eventually publish Farrow's Weinstein investigation in October 2017. Much of the book covers Farrow's time at NBC News, where he and producer Rich McHugh began working on the Weinstein investigation in January 2017. Farrow's break with NBC News \u2014 \"the story behind the story,\" as he characterizes it \u2014 makes up a large portion of the book, with details about his interactions with ousted Today anchor Matt Lauer, Megyn Kelly and attorney Lisa Bloom, who would be exposed as one of Weinstein's foot soldiers.\n\nThe book also details claims from Meredith Vieira's former assistant that Lauer assaulted her during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Current Today hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb responded to those new claims about Lauer on Wednesday's show and Lauer also released an open letter in response to the allegations in Farrow's book.\n\nBelow, The Hollywood Reporter details five additional revelations from Farrow's book.\n\nKudos from Matt Lauer\n\nOn Oct. 10, 2017, the day Farrow\u2019s New Yorker expos\u00e9 about Harvey Weinstein ran, Farrow receives a congratulatory text message from Matt Lauer. \"Ronan, it\u2019s Matt Lauer. Let me be the 567th person to say congratulations on an amazing piece!\"\n\nMegyn Kelly's neck tendon\n\nAt the Time 100 gala in April 2017, Farrow bumps into Megyn Kelly, who had recently joined NBC News from Fox News Channel. He congratulated her on her upcoming NBC show and then apologized for \"the Twitter thing\" \u2014 in which he called one of her comments racist.\n\nA tendon stood out on Kelly\u2019s neck. \"I made a lot of mistakes when I was at your point in my career, too,\" she said, smiling tightly. \"You\u2019re kind of a rookie reporter.\"\n\nAndy Lack's safe house\n\nAt the same dinner, Farrow bumps into NBC News and MSNBC chairman Andy Lack.\n\nI thanked him for getting behind investigative stories. I reached for a personal connection. My brother [Matthew Previn] has recently purchased Lack\u2019s home in Bronxville, New York.\n\n\"Apparently you left behind a giant safe they still haven\u2019t drilled open,\" I said.\n\nLack laughed. \"That\u2019s true. There is an old safe.\" He said the safe preceded him, and he hadn\u2019t opened it, either. He shrugged.\n\n\"Sometimes it\u2019s better to leave things be.\"\n\nWeinstein's political friends\n\nFarrow recounts a call from former New York Gov. George Pataki to Harvey Weinstein. Over the years, Weinstein and his company had donated to more than a dozen New York politicians and their PACs, including Hillary Clinton, Andrew Cuomo, Kirsten Gillibrand and Pataki.\n\n\"Hey Harvey, it\u2019s George. I just want to let you know, Ronan Farrow\u2019s still working on the story.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not what I hear,\" Weinstein said.\n\nPataki insisted that multiple women were talking to me. \"He\u2019s ready to go with it. It\u2019s supposed to get aired\u2014\"\n\nLisa Bloom's double dealing\n\nIt slowly dawns on Farrow that lawyer Lisa Bloom, while claiming to advise Farrow with his reporting, was actually attempting to wheedle information about his Weinstein reporting.\n\nThe last time I answered a call from Lisa Bloom that summer, I expressed astonishment.\n\n\"Lisa, you swore, as an attorney and a friend, that you wouldn\u2019t tell his people,\" I said.\n\n\"Ronan,\" she replied. \"I am his people.\"\n\nI thought of her calls and texts and voicemails pressing me for information, dangling clients\u2026Bloom told me Weinstein had optioned her book, that she\u2019d been in an awkward position. \"Ronan, you need to come in. I can help. I can talk to David [Boies] and Harvey. I can make this easier for you.\"\n\n\"Lisa, this is not appropriate,\" I said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what women you\u2019re talking to,\" she said. \"But I can give you information about them. If it\u2019s Rose McGowan, we have files on her. I looked into her myself when this first came up. She\u2019s crazy.\"", "description": "Five additional revelations \u2014 involving Matt Lauer, Andy Lack, Megyn Kelly and Lisa Bloom \u2014 from Ronan Farrow's 'Catch and Kill' book  about the challenges he faced chasing the story of Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct and his break with NBC News.", "authors": ["Marisa Guthrie", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "top_image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2019/10/image_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
