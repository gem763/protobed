He has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation, police said.\n\nJefferson was shot through a window around 2:30 a.m. as officers responded to a call from a neighbor who said the front door of the home was open, the Fort Worth Police Department said in a statement.\n\n\u201cResponding officers searched the perimeter of the house and observed a person standing inside the residence near the window,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cPerceiving a threat, the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside.\u201d\n\nOfficers then went inside and provided emergency medical care to Jefferson, but she was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.\n\nPolice released video from a body camera worn by the officer who fired the shot, which shows him approaching the front of the house and peering inside. The footage shows storm doors were closed, but two main doors behind them were open. Lights inside the house were on, and at least one car was parked in the driveway.\n\nThe officer can be seen entering the backyard, turning to the left and shining a flashlight through a window. He suddenly grabs for his gun, points it at the window and shouts, \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d before immediately opening fire.\n\nFort Worth Police Department Fort Worth Police Department\n\nPolice did not release any additional body camera footage, save for two still frames appearing to show a firearm the officers found inside the home. It\u2019s unclear whether Jefferson had been holding the gun at the time she was shot.\n\nThe police department sent HuffPost its statement and the roughly minute-long body camera video, but did not respond to questions about whether officers ever knocked on Jefferson\u2019s door or identified themselves before she was killed.\n\nJefferson was living in the house to help take care of her mother, who has a medical condition, according to Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney representing the victim\u2019s family.\n\nShe was playing video games with her nephew early Saturday when they heard a noise in the backyard, Merritt said. When Jefferson went to the window to investigate, she was shot, he said.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part about it is I spoke with an 8-year-old who explained what it was like inside of the house,\u201d Merritt told reporters Saturday.\n\nMinutes before police showed up to Jefferson\u2019s home, neighbor James Smith said he called the department\u2019s non-emergency phone number to report the doors to the house were ajar and the lights were on. He said he was concerned about Jefferson\u2019s mother, knowing she has health issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaken. I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m upset. And I feel it\u2019s partly my fault,\u201d Smith told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \u201cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\n\nCommunity members are calling for a third-party investigation into the shooting and an indictment of the officer.\n\nIn a Facebook post Saturday, Merritt said Jefferson was a pre-med graduate of Xavier University of Louisiana and worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales.\n\n\u201cShe was very close to her family,\u201d Merritt wrote. \u201cShe was the auntie that stayed up on Friday night playing video games with her 8-year old-nephew.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer mom had recently gotten very sick, so she was home taking care of the house and loving her life,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was no reason for her to be murdered. None. We must have justice.\u201d\n\nThe shooting occurred less than two weeks after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who is white, was convicted of murdering her unarmed neighbor in his own apartment. Botham Jean, who is black, had been watching TV when Guyger stormed in, saying she believed an intruder was in her own apartment, which was a floor below. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.", "description": "Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was standing near a bedroom window when the white Fort Worth police officer opened fire from outside.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da30d44210000330cacd71c.png?cache=rpysdlrg4z&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
