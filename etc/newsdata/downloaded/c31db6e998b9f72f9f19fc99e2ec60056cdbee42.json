I thought the worst and that we were going to lose our little girl.\n\n\u2018I really believed this was just a bad case of sickness.\n\n\u2018The doctor took a breath and told us that \u2018Isla is very very poorly, much more sick than we thought\u2019.\n\nIsla is doing much better now but cannot yet return to school (Picture: Solent)\n\nMs Asprey, who also had painful stomach aches and nausea after the holiday, said Isla would most likely face problems in the future when she hits puberty and pregnancy and her prognosis is still unknown.\n\nShe added: \u2018I was so pleased we had an answer and knew what has caused the failure but I\u2019m very concerned that we are yet to find out where the E.coli was contracted from and there is a high chance other people can be putting themselves at risk.\u2019\n\nA spokeswoman for Tapnell Farm said the team wished Isla a \u2018speedy recovery\u2019.\n\nPublic Health England said its investigation into the source of the infection is ongoing.\n\nE.coli is a bacteria found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle, and can be caught by eating contaminated food, touching infected animals and contact with people who have the illness.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
