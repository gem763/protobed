Well, that's what one American woman is doing, and she just might get rich for it.\n\nImages courtesy: Elana Mugdan/Twitter\n\nAbout half a year ago, in February of this year, fitness brand Vitaminwater opened up entries for a special competition called 'Scroll Free for a Year'. They asked people which of them would be willing to go a year without their smartphone, and asked them to send in applications. But it was 29-year-old Elana Mugdan who made the cut.\n\nThe young-adult fiction writer from Queens, New York, caught their attention, thanks to her cutesie video entry, filmed while at a party with friends. So they invited her to participate in the challenge. And if she managed to stay smartphone-free for a year, they would give her $100,000, or about Rs 71 lakh!\n\nThe time I spend on my phone can be put to better use. Life would improve! I'd finish writing my 5-book fantasy novel series, get back in shape, & reconnect with old friends. But don't take my word for it - watch my infomercial testimonial! #NoPhoneForAYear #Contest @vitaminwater pic.twitter.com/m6kdSXObRm \u2014 Elana A. Mugdan \ud83d\udc09 (@dragonspleen) January 5, 2019\n\nDon't Miss 1.4 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 3 K SHARES\n\nTo ensure Mugdan plays by the rules, Vitaminwater had her replace her iPhone 5S with a Kyocera flip phone that can only text and call (she's still gotta work after all). When the challenge ends in February 2020, they also plan to administer a lie detector test to see if she stayed true to her word.\n\nThere are a few allowances of course. Mugdan is allowed to use her laptop or desktop computer, meaning she can get work done on her books, as well as post to Twitter and the like. She's also allowed to use voice-activated devices like Amazon Echo, as long as they're not tethered to a smartphone. And she can't borrow a friend's smartphone either for anything, because that defeats the purpose of the challenge.\n\nAnd about eight months into her challenge now, Mugdan seems to be doing just great. \"Getting away from the smartphone has been freeing, and it has opened my eyes and made me more aware of some of my other bad health habits.\" Mugdan told CNN. \"Now I'm working on turning my life around, slowly but surely, day by day.\"\n\nLiving without a smartphone hasn't been easy though, and she says there were challenges along the way. \"Once, I almost got stranded in the SeaTac airport because the phone number I'd written down was wrong, and I had no way of looking up the right one, no way of calling a cab or Uber, and no one in the state who could help me,\" Mugdan said. Another time, while driving alone late at night, her car's check engine light began flashing but she didn't know what it meant. Without a smartphone, she had no way of looking it up, or even a GPS app to find the nearest place to go for help.\n\nAnd of course, because she can't share photos and videos of her life without a phone, Mugdan says she sometimes feels disconnected from her friends. \"Being out with folks who are constantly checking their phones and showing each other their phones and taking selfies really highlights just how addicted everyone is, and now I feel like an outsider looking in at something odd and a little unsettling,\" she said.\n\nAt the very least, Mugdan still agrees giving up her smartphone for a year was still one of the best decisions she's ever made. Her productivity has skyrocketed since, and she's made a lot of progress on her 'The Shadow War Saga' book series. \"I've decided that I will never go back to smartphone use once the one-year contest is up,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't think I can be trusted with the technology - if I have access to a smartphone, I suspect I'll go right back to abusing it, wasting time, staying up all hours of the night on it, and getting addicted to social media, and I really don't want to go back to all that.\"", "description": "Do you think you could make it a whole year without using your smartphone?
