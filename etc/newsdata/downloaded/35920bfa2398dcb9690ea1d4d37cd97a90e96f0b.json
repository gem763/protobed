The acquisition is set to be finalised at the end of October.", "description": "Cleanaway chief executive Vik Bansal says Australia is ''sorting'' its waste but doesn't actually recycle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7358%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9bba318912772af050b2086296fd4c3db8d9fc5a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
