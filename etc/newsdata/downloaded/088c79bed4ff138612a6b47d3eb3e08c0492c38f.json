It\u2019s a move that again stresses the reality that Apple and Apple alone wields the power to decide who is and is not allowed to repair your iPhone.\n\nIf you need a display repair on your iPhone, the notice states, \u201cit\u2019s important for certified technicians who use genuine Apple display parts to repair it.\u201d Those certified technicians include Apple, Authorised Service Providers, or Independent Repair Providers who have been approved by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Apple to perform repairs using OEM parts and tools.\n\n\u201cReplacements not performed by Apple, authorised service providers, or certified technicians might not follow proper safety and repair procedures and could result in improper function or issues with display quality or safety,\u201d Apple said. \u201cApple displays are designed to fit precisely within the device. Additionally, repairs that don\u2019t properly replace screws or cowlings might leave behind loose parts that could damage the battery, cause overheating, or result in injury.\u201d\n\nImage: Apple\n\nA lot of what Apple claims here appear to be big \u201cwhat ifs,\u201d namely that injury during a repair could occur if not performed by Apple or one of its partners, or that improperly replaced parts could result in injury or damage to the device. Apple says that issues that may occur with a non-genuine display include issues with display-specific iOS updates, Multi-Touch performance, display colour and brightness, and True Tone functionality. (iFixit noted in its iPhone 11 teardown that True Tone would be disabled during repair without Apple\u2019s special tools but added that \u201cat least the display is still user-swappable.\u201d)\n\nOn its newest generation of iPhones \u2014 iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max \u2014 Apple says that displays that are unable to be verified by the device will deliver an \u201cimportant display message\u201d about it that will linger on the lock screen for four days, appear in Settings for 15 days, and display indefinitely in the About section in General. You know, just in case you missed it.\n\nThis freaky display message is not the first that Apple has used to spook its users into deferring to Apple-approved repair outfits rather than, say, a yet-to-be-certified independent repair outfit or doing the repair yourself. Just last month, both The Art of Repair and iFixit surfaced another service message that appears on the iPhone XR, XS and XS Max when a replacement battery has not been authenticated to the device, indicating that Apple is essentially software-locking batteries to its phones.\n\nLike the display message, the battery message informs the user that the device is not able \u201cto verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery.\u201d When this message appears, users are unable to access important information about their battery health. Moreover, and proving that Apple believes it alone gets to decide who can repair the stuff you own, iFixit found that the issue persisted even with a legitimate Apple battery. (We reached out to Apple to see if the same would apply to display replacements and did not immediately hear back. iFixit reported that it does.)\n\nIn a somewhat surprising move, Apple announced last month that it would begin supplying independent repair shops with the necessary OEM tools, diagnostics, parts and training to repair its iPhones.\n\nWhile a welcome shift away from its previous pearl-clutching monopoly on repair, independent repair outfits must apply to join the program, and Apple said it \u201creserves the right to reject any application without comment.\u201d Plus, while the move widens the pool of options you have for where to have your phone repaired, it stops short of allowing you to do the repair yourself (or to have someone of your choosing with the technical know-how to do it for you).\n\nWhile this latest notice doesn\u2019t seem particularly surprising coming from a company with a history of hostile aversion to right to repair, it does serve as a reminder that Apple still maintains a stupid amount of control over the device you rightfully own.", "description": "Here we go again.", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/eui3d3pvkr198ff8qqkh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
