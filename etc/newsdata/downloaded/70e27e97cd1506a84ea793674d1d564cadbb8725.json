Other phones will need to wait a bit longer, however. (If you own a smartphone made by Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, HTC or Sony, you can get an idea of how much longer you need to wait here.)\n\nOn the plus side, Google released a statement today confirming that it's \"working with our partners to launch and upgrade devices to Android 10 this year.\"\n\nHopefully this means a 2019 release for every manufacturer's flagship Android. Fingers crossed!\n\nWhen Is Your Smartphone Getting Android 10? Now that we have an official name for Android Q, we\u2019re getting very close to the official release of the new operating system. It's definitely hitting soon, but with an important caveat \u2014 just because Google releases Android 10 doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to get it (unless you own a Pixel device). Here's what you need to know. Read more\n\nAndroid 10 is being billed as a very significant update for the future of smartphone technology - everything from 5G networks to foldable glass displays have been specifically catered to. It also introduces a brace of all-new features for existing smartphone models, including suggested actions in Smart Reply, new-and-improved gesture navigation and an integrated Dark Theme.\n\nHere's the official spiel from Dave Burke, Android's VP of Engineering over on the Google Blog:\n\nAndroid 10 is here! With this release, we focused on making your everyday life easier with features powered by on-device machine learning, as well as supporting new technologies like Foldables and 5G. At the same time, with almost 50 changes related to privacy and security, Android 10 gives you greater protection, transparency, and control over your data. This builds on top of our ongoing commitment to provide industry-leading security and privacy protections on Android. We also built new tools that empower people of all abilities, and help you find the right balance with technology.\n\nHow to get Android 10 on your Pixel phone\n\nAndroid 10 begins rolling out to Pixel phones today. If you haven't received an update prompt yet, go to Settings > About Phone > System Update and install it manually.\n\nIf you can't see the update, don't panic - Google typically rolls out new versions of Android over a few days so you might have to wait for later in the week.\n\nBefore you download the new OS, be sure to take the usual backup precautions just in case something goes wrong.
