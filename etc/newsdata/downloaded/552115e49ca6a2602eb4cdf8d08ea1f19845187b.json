The shift will mean the closure of 34 Fur Vaults at Macy\u2019s and 22 Maximilian salons at Bloomingdale\u2019s, the company said in an email.\n\nThe declaration from Macy\u2019s, which operates more than 600 department stores, follows a string of similar announcements from brands like Michael Kors and Gucci and even the state of California in recent years. The retailer, which is based in New York, announced the change in conjunction with the Humane Society of the United States, which said it had been pressing Macy\u2019s on fur sales for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a changing tide,\u201d said P.J. Smith, director of fashion policy at the Humane Society, which is based in Washington. \u201cConsumers care about animal welfare more and more, and the idea of luxury is changing, where it\u2019s more about who\u2019s the most socially responsible and the most innovative.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s, which reported about US$25 billion in annual sales in 2018, said that the namesake chain\u2019s private brands were already fur-free, and that fur was not a \u201cmaterial\u201d part of its business. The company said that its new policy, which was in line with guidelines from animal rights organizations, would allow for ethically sourced sheep and cattle fur products including \u201cshearling,\u201d \u201csheepskin,\u201d \u201ccalf hair\u201d and \u201ccowhide\u201d goods.\n\n\u201cOur customer is migrating away from natural fur and we are aligning with this trend,\u201d Macy\u2019s said on a new webpage about the policy. \u201cWith the rise of new fabric technology, alternatives like faux fur and other fabric innovations make this a seamless transition for our customers.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, examples of Macy\u2019s fur products for sale online included a US$4,000 fox-fur trim cape and a US$8,000 striped mink-fur jacket, while Bloomingdale\u2019s was selling a chinchilla jacket for US$14,000.\n\nMinks, foxes and rabbits are among the animals most commonly subject to cruelty in the quest for fur, according to Smith, who said that they were often killed through gassing and electrocution.\n\nSmith said that Macy\u2019s was the first major American department store to make such an announcement and that he hoped other retailers would follow suit.\n\n\u201cNow that so many brands that are sold at Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s are going fur-free, it\u2019s becoming easier for these stores,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good opportunity for them to reach that younger generation of consumers that are going to have the buying power in the very near future.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "'Our customer is migrating away from natural fur and we are aligning with this trend,' retailer says", "authors": ["Sapna Maheshwari", "The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/fur.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
