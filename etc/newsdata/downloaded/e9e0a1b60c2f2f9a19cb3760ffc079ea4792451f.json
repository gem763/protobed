Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the restrictions \"complement\" the Commerce Department's actions.\n\nChina's embassy in Washington denounced the move as \"made-up pretexts\" for interfering in China's internal affairs.\n\n\"#Xinjiang affairs are purely China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. We urge the US to correct its mistakes at once and stop its interference in China's internal affairs,\" the embassy said on Twitter.\n\nMajor US stock indexes added to losses after the State Department's announcement, with the S&P 500 index closing down about 1.6%. Investors feared the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing could doom efforts to get the trade negotiations back on track.\n\nThe US moves cast a pall over US-China trade talks in Washington, where deputy negotiators met for a second day to prepare for the first minister-level meetings in more than two months on Thursday and Friday.\n\nA spokesman for the US Trade Representative's office said that no meetings were scheduled for Wednesday, but that high-level talks involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would take place as planned on Thursday and Friday.\n\nA Chinese diplomat told Reuters that China wanted a deal, but it cannot be a \"zero-sum game.\"\n\nThe diplomat added that it was important for the United States to accept the differences between the two countries' economic systems, particularly China's state-led development model. China needed to protect its sovereignty and right to develop its economy, added the diplomat, who is not directly involved in the trade talks.\n\nChina was motivated to improve intellectual property protections, as this was in its interests, but he said U.S. allegations of IP theft by China were unfair.\n\nProspects for a breakthrough in the on-again, off-again trade talks sagged after the Commerce Department's blacklisting announcement on Monday. Hikvision, which bills itself as the world's largest maker of video surveillance gear, was among the firms targeted.\n\nThe listing bars the firms from buying components from American companies without US government approval, a potentially crippling move. It follows the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons.\n\nWashington is also moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on capital flows into China, with a focus on investments made by US government pension funds, Bloomberg reported.", "description": "The United States has\u00a0imposed\u00a0visa\u00a0restrictions on Chinese officials for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities, in a move that has angered Beijing, but a US\u00a0official said high-level trade talks would still take place on Thursday and Friday as planned.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Gs1xYpHuuu82DSFkzw8fOQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/6cb92a6bd90e2326486edf306ae898fd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
