It's just one financial concern among many for Americans: Money is our most common source of stress, according to a survey from Northwestern Mutual.\n\nSaving for retirement, though, can be particularly stressful because of its complexity. Given that our individual financial goals can vary widely, there's no one right way to do it.\n\nThat said, there are a few wrong ways to prepare for retirement -- choices that you might not think would have a significant impact, but that could end up costing you loads of cash over the long term.\n\nYoung man with cash flying out of his wallet More\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\n1. Not contributing enough to your 401(k) for the full employer match\n\nEmployer matching 401(k) contributions are essentially free money. So if you're not routing enough money into your retirement account to earn the maximum amount your company will give you, you're missing out. At first, those matching contributions may not seem like they make a big difference in your retirement account balance. But over time, they do add up.\n\nFor example, say your company matches 100% of employees' contributions up to 3% of their salary. If you earn $50,000 per year, that's $1,500 per year extra you could be getting. But if you only contribute $1,000 per year to your 401(k), you only earn a $1,000 match. Here's what your total savings would look like if you continued saving at that rate versus boosting your contributions to $1,500 per year to earn the full match (assuming you're earning a 7% annual rate of return on your investments):\n\n\n\n\n\nYears of Contributions 401(k) Balance When Contributing $1,000 per Year (+$1,000 Match) 401(k) Balance When Contributing $1,500 per Year (+ $1,500 Match) 10 $27,688 $41,449 20 $82,155 $122,986 30 $189,299 $283,382\n\nSource: Author's calculations\n\nIn other words, in this scenario, contributing an extra $500 a year to your 401(k) can add nearly $100,000 to your net worth after a few decades. This calculation also doesn't account for any salary raises you may get down the road, which would increase the amount your employer will match. In that case, you could miss out on even more money by failing to capture the full match.\n\n2. Not investing in stocks\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stock market can be intimidating, and many people associate it with risk. For that reason, some people try to play it safe with their savings by avoiding the stock market to some degree. In fact, 53% of those saving for retirement say they're stashing at least some of their cash in a savings account, according to a survey from Morning Consult.\n\nOn the surface, that doesn't seem like a bad idea. Savings accounts are safe, and they avoid the market downturns that inevitably come with investing in the stock market. However, even the highest-yielding savings accounts only have interest rates of around 2% per year. If you keep your cash in one of these accounts over several decades, your savings may not even keep up with inflation -- meaning your money could actually lose value the longer you keep it there.\n\nOf course, savings accounts do still have their merits. When you're saving for short-term financial goals and may need to pull your cash at a moment's notice, you can't beat a high-yield savings account. But if you want to be able to accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings over a few decades, the stock market is the way to go. This is especially important if you're struggling to save, because even a few thousand dollars can go a lot further in the stock market than a savings account.", "description": "Saving for retirement is hard enough as it is, but you may unknowingly be making it more challenging than it needs to be.", "authors": ["Katie Brockman", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cGF_gfck4oiPcxibBMs81A--~B/aD00OTM7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/7930740399c4e8a98ede7d6eea234f3e", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
