It stayed in the zone for about 77 minutes in total, according to the officer.\n\n\u201cUpon detecting an unidentified flight object approaching KADIZ, our Air Force scrambled multiple jets and learned it was a Chinese one. When we then tried to communicate with the Chinese side via our military hotline, China, in response, let us know of its flight information, including its route and purposes,\u201d he noted.\n\nChinese warplanes have entered KADIZ more than 25 times so far this year, but it is the first time that China shared such flight information ahead of the KADIZ entry, he added.\n\nSuch a change comes at a time when the two sides have stepped up efforts to mend defense ties soured amid tensions over Seoul\u2019s decision to host an advanced U.S. missile defense system called Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense.\n\nLast week, Seoul and Beijing held their vice ministerial-level strategic dialogue for the first time in five years and agreed to set up more hotlines between their air forces and navies.\n\nCurrently, they have one such channel between Seoul\u2019s master control and reporting center and China\u2019s northern theater command.\n\nAir defense identification zones are not territorial airspace and are not bound by international law. They are areas each country zones off to prevent infiltration by foreign planes and accidental clashes.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 A Chinese military plane entered South Korea\u2019s air defense identification zone after sending prior notification on Tuesday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
