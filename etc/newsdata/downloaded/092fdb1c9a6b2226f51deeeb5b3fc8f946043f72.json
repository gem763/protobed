Rugby is New Zealand\u2019s national game, and its obsession, but it celebrates high achievers without deifying them.\n\nHansen\u2019s standing and the scrutiny his decisions and public statements receive is more in keeping with that of the prime minister; every aspect of his stewardship of the All Blacks is news and the subject of exhaustive public debate.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be in avoidance of it, you\u2019ve got to live normally and I\u2019ve tried to do that from day one,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cAs an All Black coach you\u2019re under scrutiny, but I\u2019ve tried to live a normal life as much as I can.\n\n\u201cPeople care, they have high expectations and those high expectations I think drive the high internal expectations as well.\u201d\n\nAfter eight years as head coach and 15 years as a member of the All Blacks coaching staff, Hansen remains a popular public figure. Success helps: as an assistant to Graham Henry he helped guide New Zealand to a drought-breaking World Cup victory in 2011, and as head coach he led their successful Cup defense in 2015.\n\nHis overall record is extraordinary: the All Blacks have won 88 of 101 tests with Hansen as head coach and he has been World Rugby Coach of the Year on four occasions. The World Cup in Japan will be his last duty before he relinquishes the role and, despite all his previous successes, may define how his tenure is judged.\n\nThe All Blacks start their campaign against South Africa on Saturday in Yokohama.\n\nMany aspects of Hansen\u2019s time in charge are unquestionably positive. He helped break down the formerly hierarchical nature of All Blacks teams, giving a leadership voice to all players regardless of seniority. He created an egalitarian locker room in which veterans shared daily chores with newcomers.\n\nHe ended the closed shop nature of the team, opening the squad to \u201capprentices\u201d - young players identified as future All Blacks who were able to train and travel with the squad.\n\nAt first he recognized that he had at his disposal the most talented players in world rugby and he gave them unbridled license to use their talent - to \u201cplay what\u2019s in front of them\u201d on the field. That meant players were able to extemporize, to take chances without being accused of departing too far from the team playbook.\n\nThat approach allowed players such as Beauden Barrett to flourish and give full vent to their skills. Barrett became a two-time World Rugby Player of the Year and Hansen\u2019s team produced some of the most exhilarating rugby the world has seen.\n\nA former police officer who played rugby to top provincial level, Hansen is a straight-talker with a wry, laconic wit. He has made news conferences illuminating where previous coaches treated them as among the least favored of their duties.\n\nHe enjoys bantering with reporters, often meeting a question with a question of the \u201cwhat would you have done in my place\u201d sort. He ushered in an era of transparency which opened the inner workings of the All Blacks team to public gaze.\n\nHansen can be defensive, but that\u2019s hardly surprising; having produced such an exceptional winning record doesn\u2019t shield him from probing questions and open criticism after a defeat.\n\nIn the coaches\u2019 box he exudes a poker-faced sense of calm.\n\nMore recently things seem to have changed a little. Hansen\u2019s selections have appeared less consistent, more reactionary. He has shown fierce loyalty to some players, trusting them to play their way back into form when their performance seemed to have deteriorated. At other times he has summarily dismissed a player after one chance.\n\nHis tactical approach seemed to become more prescriptive and the players\u2019 freedom to innovate more restricted. That may simply be the result of a tactical evolution or recalabration in the face of opposing defenses which aim to stifle the All Blacks\u2018 attacking game.\n\nIf so, Hansen has the chance to answer his nation\u2019s pleas, to sign off at the World Cup, on rugby\u2019s biggest stage, with a performance which crowns a great coaching career.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As the focus of the earnest hopes of a nation which venerates sporting achievement, All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen insists \"I'm just a normal bloke.\"", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/japan_rugby_new_zealand_63036_c0-157-3753-2345_s1770x1032.jpg?7a46fe9ddd19d8cebc2ebfa62d2cb820dac6cf53", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
