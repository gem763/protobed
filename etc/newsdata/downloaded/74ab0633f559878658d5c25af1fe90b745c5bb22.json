He was registered as a lobbyist for the National Association of Software and Service Companies, which represents Indian and U.S. companies that aim to keep the the H-1B visa program for foreign workers with advanced degrees. In 2016, Trump criticized the H-1B visa program, calling it \u201ca cheap labor\u201d program.\n\nWolf has spent years advocating for \u201ccheap foreign tech workers,\u201d said a senior DHS official, who said Wolf\u2019s appointment might cause them to resign. \u201cHe was the lone voice the previous secretary listened to. Her views on border enforcement, public charge and protecting American workers are his views\u2026.I signed up for the Trump message, not the Jeb Bush administration.\u201d\n\nA former DHS colleague of Wolf's pushed back on the notion that Wolf isn't as tough on immigration as Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre dynamic that these so-called hawks label anybody, other than [senior policy adviser] Stephen Miller, as soft on immigration,\u201c this person said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where they\u2019re getting it from that Chad\u2019s immigration views diverge from the president.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli and Morgan didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The White House also didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump could still ignore the advice from staff and name Cuccinelli or Morgan as an acting secretary \u2014 though he would likely face an immediate legal challenge \u2014 or consider them for permanent job if he chooses to nominate someone.\n\n\u201cI think he would look at either of them as more of a permanent nominee than as an acting person,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the goal would be to have another long-term acting. It would be to have somebody acting while the nominee\u2019s confirmed.\u201d\n\nThe president has long favored acting officials and, at least one person familiar with the situation says, he is expected to appoint a secretary on a temporary basis as he enters the final year of his term. It would be tough to get the type of leader he wants confirmed by even the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nTrump has gone through four DHS secretaries in less than three years in part because he and his allies grew dissatisfied with officials they thought were not sufficiently committed to the president\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t agree inside the White House on what immigration policy should be,\u201c said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for less immigration.", "description": "President Donald Trump has been notified by his staff that he can\u2019t select two popular figures \u2014 Ken Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan \u2014 to serve as an acting secretary of homeland security because a federal law governing agency succession makes them ineligible.
