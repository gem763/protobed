A woman took to Facebook to warn brides-to-be about a scamming 'cake decorator' who swindled one bride out of $300 for a horrendous cake\n\nRequest: The Georgia-based bride has originally requested a wedding cake that looked like a simplified version of this design by a Texas bakery, but with less cupcakes and two birds\n\nInstead of the peacock with a swirling tail that flowed over adjoining cupcakes, the woman was left with what was later deemed, 'a turkey with leprosy'.\n\nA close friend of the devastated bride took to Facebook to name and shame, warning others about the 'imposter that is trying to be a qualified cake decorator'.\n\nAnnette Davis Hill recalled that another friend of the bride had initially reached out to the baker with the image and asked could the new cake have two birds instead of one, and not as many cupcakes.\n\nSaid baker replied to say she was up for the job and that it would cost $300.\n\nWhen the hopeful bride had her cake delivered at 6 PM the night before her wedding, she was horrified when she opened the box - after the baker had ran for the hills.\n\nAnnette wrote, 'One of the bird's heads falls off immediately (and proceeds to fall off two more times after that). The bride, near tears, fixes it as best she can each time and is devastated by how the cake looks.'\n\nHack job: The baker told the devastated bride that she couldn't see what was wrong with the cake, and refused to give her her money back\n\nAnnette clarified that the cake maker came back after a phone call from the bride, bringing with her a pan of Rice Krispie treats which she told the bride she could use to 'reshape the birds'.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the baker told the hysterical bride that she 'really didn't understand what they saw wrong with the cake'.\n\nApart from the monstrous-looking birds, the cake wasn't covered with white fondant as requested and the buttercream frosting was either cracking or so thin that you could see the sponge cake through it.\n\n'There's nothing decorative between the layers. Nobody has any idea why the ugly, gold fleur de lis things are on it (or New Orleans Saints symbols as most of the guys there called them),' Annette added.\n\n'The one \"peacock\" looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the 'white' bird, which isn't white at ALL, doesn't even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, it's just a brown BLOB,' she continued.\n\nDue to lack of support, the birds also seemed to be sinking into the cake and on the day of the wedding, they had almost come through the base of the dessert.\n\nAnnette revealed that the poor bride was going from store to store on the morning of her nuptials trying to find a replacement.\n\nThe baker also refused to refund her.\n\nSinking: Due to the weight of the 'bird' being unsupported, its head kept toppling over and it eventually sank through to the bottom of the cake\n\nAnnette's post went viral when shared on social media, racking up 8,000 shares and thousands of bemused comments comparing it to everything from a 'dead pigeon' to 'something a child would make'.\n\n'That has got to be the ugliest cake I\u2019ve ever seen! As bad as it looks I almost want to throw up on thinking about how it tastes,' one woman said.\n\n'Omg the first ever cake I made when I was [seven] was 100 [per cent] better then that. I would hit the baker with that cake if I was the bride,' said another.\n\n'That [is] absolutely pitiful! I've been a Cake Decorator for over 20 years and I've taught classes at a local Jr. College and I believe my students could've done better.\n\n'I'm so sorry for the bride. Weddings are so stressful and the cake is so important. Please always check references. It makes me sad for their special day,' one woman offered in support.\n\nSome people fired back that the bride shouldn't have expected 'high quality' work for $300.\n\n'Okay, that cake almost made me sick. See some things you can't low ball and a wedding cake is one of those things,' one user said.\n\n'While I do think it's super sh**ty for anyone to take the job and act like they can do it and then deliver something like this, I also don't understand why people continue trying to get high quality work done for a fraction of the usual price. Cakes like these are hard to make so they're expensive,' agreed another.", "description": "A baker told the bride she could make a peacock-inspired design, right, for $300, but showed up with a disheveled and horrendous-looking dessert that looked like a child made it, left.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/14/19493216-0-image-a-10_1570628121844.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
