How sadly predictable.", "language": "en", "text": "After Trump proposed his ban on Muslim immigration in 2015, Sasse gave a speech on the Senate floor in which he denounced \u201cdemagoguing leaders\u201d and \u201ca megalomaniac strongman \u2026 screaming about travel bans and deportation.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, he compared Trump to former KKK leader David Duke and described Trump\u2019s rise as a personal breaking point. \u201cThis is the party of Abraham Lincoln,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the party of David Duke, Donald Trump.\u201d\u2026\n\nEven after Trump had secured the nomination, Sasse refused to fall in line. When asked if he would be attending the GOP convention, his office said that the senator would\u201d instead take his kids to watch some dumpster fires across the state, all of which enjoy more popularity than the current front-runners.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Sykes", "Nbcnews.Com Think Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
