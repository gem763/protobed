Jonas is set to join the singing competition in spring 2020. USA TODAY\n\n\"The Voice\" fans need to calm down because Taylor Swift is here.\n\nThe 10-time Grammy winner joined the NBC singing competition Monday during the first round of Knockouts. And if you think the contestants were star-struck, just imagine how Swift felt returning to \"The Voice\" as a \"mega-mentor.\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t realize I was being called a mega-mentor. That\u2019s going to go straight to my head,\" Swift said, jokingly snapping her fingers. \"I would like a latte right now.\"\n\nBut Swift didn't need to offer any advice to John Legend\u2019s first pairing. Max Boyle went head-to-head with Katie Kadan, a true David and Goliath scenario.\n\nKadan, a four-chair turn who has dominated with her powerful vocals, chose to sing Erma Franklin's \"Piece of My Heart\" following her experience with bullying.\n\nKatie Kadan: Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton go head-to-head over four-chair turn\n\n\"God, it was so quirky and fun and funny and ballsy,\" Swift said during rehearsals, before quickly asking, \"Can I say that on TV?\" She added, \"We were lucky to see it.\"\n\nGoing up against Kadan seemed like a lost cause, and Legend and Swift appeared to have already counted Boyle out before his turn.\n\n\"Max is up after Katie, and \u2026 I\u2019m sorry,\" Swift said, while Legend added, \"I\u2019m sorry you have to go after that.\" But the Ohio native delivered big time with an emotional ballad inspired by his breakup.\n\n\"You can say he\u2019s the underdog in this situation, 'cause Katie\u2019s so great, but Max is making it as challenging as it can possibly be,\" Legend said.\n\nAs expected, Kadan blew the coaches away during her performance, but Boyle really surprised everyone with his intimate rendition of Billie Eilish's \"When the Party's Over.\"\n\n\"I expected Katie to be Wonder Woman and I didn\u2019t expect you to be Superman,\" Kelly Clarkson said. Gwen Stefani added, \"You were gorgeous. \u2026 It's rare to be so emotional.\"\n\nUltimately, Legend dubbed Kadan the winner. \"I can see her going extremely far in this show, if not carrying away 'The Voice' trophy herself,\" he said.\n\nBut Boyle's time on the show was not over, because Clarkson and Stefani both hit their steal buttons, the coaches' only steal for the round.\n\nHe chose to join Team Kelly. \"I had to steal Max. This performance where he got to pick his song, it was so peaceful and perfect,\" Clarkson said. (Stefani has her steal to use on another singer.)\n\nKnockouts on \"The Voice\" continue Tuesday at 8 EDT/PDT on NBC.\n\nLast week on 'The Voice': Blake Shelton made everyone cry with his sweet words about 'magical' singer\n\nSee our full coverage of entertainment news\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/29/the-voice-mega-mentor-taylor-swift-no-critique-double-steal/2491815001/", "description": "\"The Voice\" fans need to calm down because Taylor Swift is here.
