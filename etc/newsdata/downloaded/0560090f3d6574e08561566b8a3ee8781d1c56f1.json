But are there some items that shouldn\u2019t be stored in your bathroom cupboard?\n\nMedical experts say yes. We surveyed nurses to get their take on what they would never keep in their own medicine cabinets and why you shouldn\u2019t either. Their answers may surprise you.\n\n1. Makeup that\u2019s beyond its expiration date\n\nCaiaimage/Tom Merton via Getty Images\n\n\u201cRepeated use of expired makeup, especially foundation and eyeliners, can cause infection,\u201d said Sandy Cayo, a clinical assistant professor of nursing at New York University\u2019s Rory Meyers College of Nursing. She added that with every use of expired makeup, \u201cyou increase the chances of bacterial growth \u2014and in turn breakouts and infections.\u201d\n\nYour makeup products should have an expiration date listed on the packaging, but in the event that they don\u2019t, here is a rough guideline as to how long things should last:\n\nMascara: three months to six months\n\n\n\n\n\nEyeliner: six months to one year\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundation: two years\n\n\n\n\n\nLipstick: two years\n\n\n\n\n\nBlush, eye shadow, face powders: one year to two years\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural, preservative-free cosmetics: three months to six months\n\n\n\n2. Narcotics\n\nAny drug that you don\u2019t want into the hands of kids or home guests should be stored somewhere more secure than a medicine cabinet, said Teri Dreher, a registered nurse and owner of NShore Patient Advocates in Chicago.\n\nDreher said narcotics, in particular, should be under lock and key, or safely hidden. (Examples of these include medications like codeine and oxycodone.) And when they\u2019re no longer needed, they should be disposed of at special boxes at pharmacies or police stations.\n\n\u201cThere is a nationwide opioid epidemic and you can never be more careful that narcotics do not end up in the wrong hands,\u201d Dreher explained.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to get rid of any narcotics that are expired and you no longer need. \u201cIf you have been treated for an injury or a surgery and were prescribed narcotics but didn\u2019t use them all, they should be properly disposed,\u201d explained Ashley Cook, the patient safety manager at Avista Adventist Hospital in Louisville Colorado.\n\n3. Medications\n\nNot storing your medications in a medicine cabinet may sound counterintuitive, but Gail Trauco, a patient advocate and CEO of medical retail store The PharmaKon LLC in Atlanta, doesn\u2019t recommend keeping them there.\n\n\u201cAll medications have [expiration] dates and temperature storage requirements,\u201d Trauco said, adding that it can be challenging to read what\u2019s on labels as they fade in a medicine cabinet.\n\nCrystal Polson, a nurse practitioner and founder of patient advocacy blog Prudent Patient, pointed out that bathroom conditions can degrade what\u2019s outside and inside medicine containers. \u201cMany medications are sensitive to heat and moisture from your shower, bath or sink. They can break down from the humidity or become less potent due to the change in temperature,\u201d she said.\n\nPolson said it\u2019s best to store your medications in a cool, dry place. \u201cIf there are young children around, be sure to keep drugs in a locked box or cabinet,\u201d she added.\n\n4. Retinol and vitamin C-based products\n\nSkin care products that contain retinol should never be stored in a medicine cabinet, Trauco said. Light, air and heat alter the chemical structure of retinol, limiting its efficacy. And the same goes with vitamin C-infused products.\n\n\u201cSkin care products filled with vitamin C are very popular,\u201d Trauco said. \u201cUnfortunately, heat reduces its potency, so store those serums and moisturizers someplace else, away from heat and light.\u201d\n\n5. Emergency medications\n\nTiffany Parker, an emergency nurse in Jacksonville, North Carolina, said to keep the following out of your medicine cabinet: EpiPens, sublingual nitroglycerine tablets, rescue inhalers, insulin, glucose tablets, and blood glucose level measuring supplies for diabetics.\n\n\u201cThose should never be left in the medicine cabinet because there is a potential to forget and leave the house without them,\u201d Parker explained.\n\nShe recommended keeping these items in a purse or an easily carried \u201cgo bag\u201d so you are never without these lifesaving supplies. (Just don\u2019t leave them in a hot car or somewhere that puts them at risk.)\n\n6. Your toothbrush\n\n5second via Getty Images\n\nKathy Frerk, a registered nurse in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, explained that a cabinet can hoard the heat and humidity of your bathroom, allowing harmful organisms to grow. That can be bad news for a device that you then stick in your mouth.\n\n\u201cAfter using, store your toothbrush standing upright so it can air dry and not harbor moisture,\u201d Frerk said. And to cut down on gum disease, Frerk also recommended soaking your toothbrush in Listerine to kill bacteria. And don\u2019t forget to replace your toothbrush every three months.\n\n7. Used razor blades\n\nHow many times have you tossed your razor into your medicine cabinet, then pulled it out later to reuse over and over for longer than you should?\n\n\u201cAn old blade and irritated skin is a dangerous combination \u2014 and just because you don\u2019t see the cuts on your skin doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there,\u201d Cayo said. She added that this is because a worn-out blade can cause microscopic tears in your skin and introduce bacteria, which in turn can increase the risk for infection.\n\nSome tips for helping to keep your razor blade clean include rinsing it with warm water between strokes to remove hair clogging it, towel drying it once you finish shaving, and allowing it to air out when you store it. (Avoid closed-off cabinets.) Experts also suggest replacing a disposable razor blade after every five to 10 uses, and refraining from sharing one with a friend or family member.\n\n8. Gummy vitamins\n\nThis is more of an access issue. Gummy vitamins taste like candy, and you don\u2019t want kids going into the medicine cabinet looking for them, Parker explained. Medicine cabinets are easy to get into for young children, and they may take it upon themselves to eat the vitamins when they\u2019re not under supervision. And ingesting too many vitamins can be extremely toxic, Parker said. She recommended storing them out of a kid\u2019s reach and with a childproof lid.\n\n9. Hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol\n\nJummie via Getty Images\n\nThis is something Polson said she generally avoids keeping around in her bathroom, medicine cabinet or otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhy? Contrary to popular belief, these two agents are not appropriate for cleaning minor cuts and scrapes. In fact, they can both harm skin tissue and delay wound healing,\u201d Polson said.\n\nShe added that the best way to take care of a minor injury is with clean water and mild soap. Sticking your cut under cool water, gently lathering up, and rinsing it for five minutes can do the job of removing any debris, bacteria and dirt. And an emergency physician should handle larger or deeper cuts.\n\n10. Liquid bandage\n\nThis specific product is not something that Catherine Burger, a registered nurse and media specialist for RegisteredNursing.org, recommended having in your medicine cabinet\u2019s first aid kit. While a liquid bandage-based product can work on cuts if administered correctly, it\u2019s often not applied well at home in a hurry.\n\n\u201cWe have had to pick these products out of too many infected wounds. Plus, the products can be very painful for superficial cuts,\u201d Burger explained.", "description": "Time to clean out that bathroom storage space ASAP.", "authors": ["On Assignment For Huffpost"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e045f2200006b0353a130.jpeg?cache=CLgBAun8pA&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
