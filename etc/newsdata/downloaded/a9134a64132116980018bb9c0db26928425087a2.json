It\u2019s general American policy to neither confirm nor deny the specific location of nuclear weapons on vessels and storage sites overseas. That practice was a major part of what led to the late-1980s rupture in the U.S.-New Zealand alliance: Wellington\u2019s Labour government grew uncomfortable with the likelihood of nuclear weapons passing through New Zealand waters, and the U.S. government wouldn\u2019t certify that its vessels were explicitly nonnuclear.\n\nWhat we do know is that B61 warheads in NATO nations are held for safe storage in special electronic vaults\u2014known as a Weapons Storage and Security System, or WS3\u2014in the floors of hardened bunkers. Deep inside Incirlik, these vaults are some of the last checks against nuclear theft or detonation by, say, a rogue Turkish government or allied militia. Some additional safety is provided by permissive action links\u2014essentially, access entry codes\u2014on the bombs themselves, but these delay rather than prevent unauthorized use. Given sufficient time and access to these weapons, a sophisticated adversary with the resources of a nation-state could likely figure out a way to use them\u2014if not as designed, then in a way that would still release disastrous and deadly radiation. The only way to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen is to physically remove the weapons.\n\nWhen it comes to occasionally pulling its nuclear weapons out of allied countries, the United States has some well-known experience: It\u2019s removed arms from the United Kingdom, Greece, and a German base under NATO auspices, with little logistical or political difficulty. Turkey\u2019s case appears a bit more fraught: The Times, based on an interview with one unnamed U.S. official, suggested that the American nuclear bombs \u201cwere now essentially Erdogan\u2019s hostages.\u201d That\u2019s literally untrue, since the weapons remain in U.S. Air Force custody, but the underlying idea is that \u201cto fly them out of Incirlik would be to mark the de facto end of the Turkish-American alliance.\u201d But that statement seems inaccurate, too: This dysfunctional alliance can\u2019t and won\u2019t be saved by the physical presence of American bombs on Turkish soil. The weapons are a liability and serve no valid reassurance purpose\u2014not to Turkey specifically, or to NATO more generally. The bombs can most certainly leave, and Turkey can remain as NATO\u2019s intolerable black sheep\u2014its status in the alliance being a problem for another day.\n\nWhere those weapons could go after being removed from Turkey is a different thorny question. Given deep-seated European skepticism of American intentions at the moment, accepting a nuclear deployment under a Trump president would kick off a political hurricane\u2014one that each NATO member nation is eager to avoid. But as Turkey expert Aaron Stein notes, the U.S.\u2019s oldest NATO-deployed B61s, including those at Incirlik, were slated for upgrades and maintenance, for which the weapons would rotate out to the United States, likely the Pantex nuclear assembly plant in West Texas. (The bombs are due to receive a new \u201ctail kit assembly\u201d as part of planned modernization to increase their \u201cprecision.\u201d) This upgrade has been considerably delayed, but the bombs might need to come home sooner than planned.\n\nThat\u2019s because waiting out the current U.S.-Turkish crisis seems... imprudent. President Trump was already beleaguered by Turkey controversies before the anti-Kurdish offensive began: His first national security adviser admitted in federal court that he was a paid Turkish agent. We also learned this week that Trump pressured Rex Tillerson, his first secretary of state, to get a Turkish Erdogan-connected gold dealer, represented by Rudy Giuliani, free of federal charges in connection with Iranian sanctions violations.", "description": "The best time to get atomic weapons out was several years ago.
