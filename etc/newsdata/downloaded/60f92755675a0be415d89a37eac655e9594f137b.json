Come to think of it, most members don\u2019t either. A lot of Labour MPs aren\u2019t even going. Following today\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, and tomorrow\u2019s resumption of business in parliament, the whole thing is looking rather overshadowed. And that\u2019s no bad thing at all.\n\nI was always told by my grandmother never to air my dirty laundry in public. Conferences do just that. Factions compete for control in public view. Rows over procedure erupt, confusing anyone who might be tuning in. Arguments over policy expose disagreements and divisions that we all know exist, but which we normally do our level best to cover up. Opportunities for gaffes, being overheard, and contradicting policy are everywhere. It\u2019s a minefield. All the while, senior figures are guarded by their own bag carriers against the inevitable request for a selfie.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAn extraordinary range of eclectic individuals with a peculiar dress sense appear on platforms and espouse their considered view on all matters before the nation. Some of those views, let\u2019s be honest, are mad. We all know the party staffers and insiders flinch the moment the conference floor is opened up to members. Archaic language and terminology from enthusiastic and excited \u201ccomrades\u201d baffle the viewers.\n\nThe Labour Party has a long history of feisty and sometimes vicious party conferences. Ideologues argue with pragmatists over the best route to socialism, or social democracy, or democratic socialism, or nowadays sometimes even Marxism.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

All provide delightful opportunities for the media to present the Labour Party as composed of people with raised, clenched fists, waving Palestinian flags, and handing out antisemitic cartoons, that is, if they aren\u2019t already protesting outside against their own conference.\n\nThere is, of course, a wider debate around the necessity of the entire conference period. For a month of the parliamentary calendar, parliament is suspended while MPs, party and parliamentary staff, councillors and party members head off to the seaside. In this period, there is no parliamentary scrutiny of the executive and no accountability of executive decision making. For one month of the year, we have an elected dictatorship. For one month, our politicians are away from work, self-aggrandizing, building their networks and enjoy drinks parties.\n\nAt conferences, politicians and members spend four days at fringe meetings sponsored by lobby groups and special interests. An enormous number of private off-the-record meetings take place between decision makers at all levels of government and those seeking to influence them. No record is kept of agreements that are made.\n\nSelections and appointments of candidates are organised, handshakes secure policy agreements, and rumours become rife. They serve no practical purpose to the effective government and administration of the nation. They are in many respects redundant.\n\nSurely in the 21st century the party conference has become an outdated event. With social media, the internet and digital campaigning reaching new and fantastic heights, do we need an annual conference? The cost of party conferences is amazing and unaffordable to many members and supporters. Big corporations, monopolies and well-funded campaigns love them, as their cheque-book gives them total access to the elite of government. Decisions made at conferences rarely are enacted as political conditions change through time.\n\nLet\u2019s make 2019 the last of this expensive and unnecessary performance. Instead, parties could organise a week of social action: community cleanups, fundraising for charities or other noble causes, combined with online voting to help shape policy. Members and groups are quite capable of pitching ideas with video if so inclined. Let\u2019s keep our MPs in Westminster and in their constituencies, doing their job.\n\nBrendan Chilton is a Labour councillor in Ashford and was head of the Labour Leave campaign during the EU Referendum", "description": "This may surprise delegates and members debating rule changes and motions, but most people are not tuning into BBC Parliament Live to watch the Labour Party Annual Conference in Brighton.", "authors": ["Brendan Chilton"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/12/corbyn-labour-conference-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
