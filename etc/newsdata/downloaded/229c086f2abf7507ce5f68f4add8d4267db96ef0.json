That means it will have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s early morning address to supporters came as his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer, had just begun speaking to his own backers, forcing TV networks to break away from Scheer.\n\nBut the prime minister struck a conciliatory note: \u201cTo those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you, we will govern for everyone.\u201d\n\nWith results still trickling in, the Liberals had 157 seats - 13 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons - while the Conservatives had 121.\n\nWhile Trudeau claimed a mandate, his party won fewer raw votes nationally than the Conservatives did, and failed to win a single seat in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where the Conservatives dominated.\n\nThere is a growing outrage in Alberta, home to the third-largest oil reserves in the world, over Trudeau\u2019s inability to get a pipeline built to the Pacific Coast so that Alberta\u2019s oil can command a higher price.\n\n\u201cTo Canadians in Alberta and Saskatchewan,\u201d he said after his victory, \u201cknow that you are an essential part of our great country. I have heard your frustration, and I want to be there to support you. Let us all work hard to bring our country together.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trudeau said Canadians elected a progressive government that will fight climate change. That means he will keep a national carbon tax in place that has also angered western Canada.\n\nIn what was supposed to be a concession speech, Scheer said the results showed Trudeau was much weakened since his 2015 election, when pundits had predicted the beginning of another Trudeau dynasty. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, was prime minister from 1968 to 1984, apart from a brief interruption in 1979-80.\n\n\u201cConservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cAnd Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win.\u201d\n\nCanada was also further divided by the electoral success of the separatist Bloc Quebecois in the French-speaking province of Quebec. The Bloc won 32 of the province\u2019s 78 districts, up from 10.\n\nThe party, however, didn\u2019t talk about separatism during the campaign and is not expected to seek a referendum for independence from Canada.\n\nTrudeau, 47, prevailed after a series of scandals that diminished his rock-star appeal from 2015 and tarnished his image as a liberal icon.\n\nOld photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month, and Trudeau was also accused of bullying his female attorney general into dropping the prosecution of a Canadian engineering company.\n\nAlso, environmentalists have accused him of betrayal for spending billions to buy the pipeline in a so-far unsuccessful bid to get the stalled project moving again. It has been held up by environmental opposition and court challenges.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at how well Trudeau has done,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority, but they (the Liberals) are not that far off.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberals are likely to rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and pass legislation. That will further alienate Western Canada because New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh is against the pipeline project.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in a stronger-than-expected showing in Canada's national elections, claiming a \"clear mandate\" Tuesday despite a Parliament and nation increasingly fractured along regional lines.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Gillies"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/canada_election_liberals_22419_c0-251-3014-2009_s1200x700.jpg?12a91d638fc32660f22d3ca1685f5a408891e60f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
