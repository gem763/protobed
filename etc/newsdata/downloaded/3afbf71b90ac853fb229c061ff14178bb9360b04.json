Conaie has led protests against the law but has rejected vandalism that swept Quito on Saturday.\n\n\"There's no real dialogue without guarantees for the safety of indigenous leaders,\" Conaie said in a statement on Twitter.\n\n\"We'll carry out approaches to try to repeal the decree,\" it added, \"but we will hold protest actions nationally ... exhorting the government to provide necessary guarantees.\"\n\nIt did not specify when it would hold protests or if it would do so in defiance of the curfew. Moreno did not say when the curfew in Quito would end.\n\nEcuador has already been in a state of emergency for two months.\n\nEarly on Saturday Quito had entered a tenth day of unrest over President Lenin Moreno's austerity plan, with local markets shuttered and police firing tear gas at protesters gathered at the country's parliamentary building.\n\nThe streets of downtown Quito resembled a war zone. Plumes of tear gas clouded streets littered with bricks and small fires, as groups of people huddled behind walls and makeshift barricades for protection.\n\nHuman rights groups and protesters have denounced the police crackdown as heavy handed and urged authorities to issue restraint. The police said on Twitter on Saturday that the protests were not peaceful.", "description": "Ecuadorean indigenous group Conaie said late on Saturday that it would continue anti-austerity protests after President Lenin Moreno imposed a military-enforced curfew in the capital Quito", "authors": ["Daniel Bellamy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/64/12/1000x563_cmsv2_a870aac2-d4ee-5280-ac38-fdc795174f25-4226412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
