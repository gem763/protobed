If there are no consequences to persistently easy monetary policy, then many people would say: why not cut?\n\nIn fact, some would argue that the right policy strategy for the RBA in an environment of declining effectiveness is to do more.\n\nThere is however, accumulating evidence from places such as Europe and Japan of economic and social costs associated with keeping interest rates below a normal level for an extended period of time.\n\nThe traditional framework for thinking about monetary policy says that the cost of over-stimulating the economy is rising consumer price index inflation. But the question that needs to be asked is: are there other costs to ultra-easy monetary policy?\n\nIt is quite clear that the ultra-easy monetary policy is inflating asset prices. Every country has a particular set of tax, legal and cultural arrangements that means they have a particular susceptibility.\n\nExcessive asset price inflation can also lead to worsening wealth inequality and a deterioration in income inequality.\n\nIn America, excess liquidity appears to escape into the economy via the equity markets. Here in Australia, I doubt anyone would disagree that our Achilles heel is residential property markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsset price inflation over and above an amount justified by underlying fundamentals can result in overinflated balance sheets across the economy. This encourages debt accumulation and leaves consumers and businesses vulnerable to a correction in asset prices back to their long-run fundamental value.\n\nThis side effect of easy money is well understood by central banks, to the point that they make well-informed judgments about the risks they are prepared to take with asset prices when setting monetary policy.\n\nExcessive asset price inflation can also lead to worsening wealth inequality and a deterioration in income inequality. This isn\u2019t something you hear central bankers talk about much.\n\nLow rates have consequences\n\nInequality is difficult to define and even harder to measure. This doesn\u2019t tend to sit well with numerically oriented central bank economists. But it influences the performance of the economy. Rising financial inequality will tend to promote saving over consumption.\n\nMore importantly, it can have profound social and political ramifications. While this is not obvious in Australia right now, it is clear to see in Europe and the United States.\n\nInequality undermines support for existing economic and political arrangements in the broader community. This is turn will make effective economic policymaking, particularly structural economic reform, more difficult.\n\nAnother potential consequence of persistently low interest rates is a reduction in the allocative efficiency of the economy. By keeping interest rates well below a neutral level, central banks can inadvertently hamper the effective allocation of capital within an economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInnovation and productivity are in no small part driven by capital seeking its best return. This is not just a matter of capital being deployed effectively. It is also a process of freeing up unproductive capital through bankruptcy.\n\nThere is an increasing body of work using data from Japan and Europe that demonstrates that ultra-easy monetary policy is keeping inefficient firms in operation, effectively trapping equity capital and reducing industry and economy-wide investment and productivity.\n\nIf monetary policy is increasingly ineffective and there are potential costs associated with it, then one would expect a degree of caution from central banks. The RBA has reduced the cash rate by half in three moves over four months. This is on top of an easing of prudential regulatory standards and income tax relief.\n\nWith interest rates fast approaching the dreaded zero lower bound, one could ask: why such bold policy action? The effective operation of monetary policy is of genuine concern. It might be time to conduct a public review of the monetary policy framework, its targets and its tools.", "description": "Low rates no longer boost growth for all.
