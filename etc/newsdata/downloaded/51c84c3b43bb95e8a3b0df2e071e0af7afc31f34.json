China accuses foreign parties in the U.S. and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations.\n\nMorey\u2019s now-deleted tweet read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nHouston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta attempted to distance the team from Morey\u2019s tweet with a Twitter post of his own: \u201cListen.@darylmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nNBA chief communications officer Mike Bass released a statement Sunday night.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,\u201d Bass said. \u201cWhile Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s relationship with the Rockets has been especially close because Chinese Hall of Famer Yao Ming played his NBA career with the team.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China's official basketball association says it will suspend cooperation with the Houston Rockets following a tweet by the NBA team's", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/06/04d28c_rockets-clippers-basketball-41716-los-angeles-clippers-shooting-guard-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
