Next door, buyers from across the globe were already writing orders for the collection. Hanging from rails the length of the room, the frothy skirts, zebra prints, and embellished matador jackets that had stirred the audience (there were reports of tears) now looked like soldiers at rest.\n\nVan Noten, based in Antwerp since 1986, is one of the few major independent designers. (Last year, he sold a majority stake in his company to Puig, but still operates independently.) Lacroix is a grand couturier and one of the most beloved figures in Paris. In the fall of 1987, he spectacularly turned New York society on its head with his Bo-Peep crinolines and ribbons. And then came the Wall Street crash that October. It would auger Lacroix\u2019s own career: the investment from LVMH in his own couture house \u2014 in an exquisite maison with a private garden, opposite the Bristol Hotel \u2014 and then his struggle to gain a footing in the harsh battleground of ready-to-wear, and finally the collapse and sell-off of the brand. Lacroix presented his last couture collection a decade ago. It was a beaut, perhaps in part because it was done on a comparative dime. Since then he has been a costume designer.\n\nWhat he and Van Noten did on Wednesday wasn\u2019t rare. It was unprecedented. As far as I can tell, no couturier and ready-to-wear designer have ever worked together before on a runway collection. There have been \u201ccapsule\u201d collaborations between designers and mass or leisure brands \u2014 Karl Lagerfeld and H&M, for example, or Rick Owens and Birkenstock. But from the outset, Van Noten says he didn\u2019t want his project with Lacroix to be seen in that context \u2014 as just another marketing opportunity. \u201cI think it would be a pity to call it a collaboration, and it especially couldn\u2019t be an homage, because Christian is still alive and kicking,\u201d Van Noten said. \u201cIt was more of a conversation. He could teach me certain things, and I could teach him things, and we could talk \u2026 and see where it was going to end.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nFrom their initial meeting in March in Paris, the two men agreed to keep the project secret, in part to avoid the impression that it was a standard brand collab. Indeed, most people only learned that Lacroix was involved when they entered the show space \u2014 the monumental backstage of the opera house, where a raised catwalk was set up in the center and the seating around it. A red rose stem rested at each place. That was the first clue: audiences at Lacroix\u2019s shows used to pelt the runway with flowers.\n\n\u201cI started to work on this collection in February,\u201d Van Noten said, explaining what led him to contact Lacroix. \u201cNormally, I try to avoid escapism and nostalgia, but the world is not a very nice at the moment. So many things go wrong, and I thought maybe it would be interesting to do something about escapism.\u201d\n\nAs he and his youngish design team began to gather images for an inspiration board \u2014 images of historical costumes, romantic shapes, and prints, movie stills \u2014 he realized there were a number of pictures of Lacroix\u2019s \u201980s fashion. Van Noten thought, why not be really transported to that world of beauty?\n\nHe emailed Lacroix.\n\n\u201cI was quite amazed, of course,\u201d the couturier said. \u201cWe never had a personal relationship. I was just an admirer.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nYet when Lacroix saw the detailed mood board, and the fabrics that Van Noten had already developed \u2014 florals based on 18th-century textiles, vibrant zebra and leopard prints, papery taffetas and grosgrain ribbon galore \u2014 he thought, You don\u2019t need me.\n\nLacroix did not actually sketch anything for the collection. Rather, when he and Van Noten met for monthly fittings in Antwerp, they worked on silhouettes and proportions, on combining fabrics in bolder ways, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 on the presentation itself, including hair and makeup.\n\nVan Noten recalled a session early on when, studying a model in a blend of patterns and a peplumed skirt, he wondered if \u201cit was too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen [Christian] took a feather and stuck it in her hair,\u201d Van Noten said, \u201cand then another feather, and the girl was standing there with this wavy ostrich feather. It made it more believable.\u201d He added, \u201cOkay, it was a gesture what he did, but that gesture liberated us. You look at what you\u2019re doing in a different way. We felt really free doing this collection. We completely forgot \u2018is it cool?\u2019 \u2018Is it fashionable?\u2019 Let\u2019s just do polka dots!\u201d\n\nWith all the freedom that Van Noten has as a designer \u2014 and, as a financially successful independent, he has more than most \u2014 he still knows that \u201cyou become conditioned to a format,\u201d he said, with the business dictating more and more decisions. Inviting Lacroix to the \u201cconversation\u201d was a reminder to stay open.\n\nFor me, that was the chief thrill of the show \u2014 this willingness to depart from convention, in an industry that wants to lock everyone down. And the clothes are that much better for it. What I especially loved was the easy blending of attitudes: the formal (the brass-buttoned officer tunics, the splendid toreador jackets in pale blue and scarlet red) and the informal (a white singlet with a feather-slashed tulle top, the loose chemise dresses, the comfy sweaters over ball skirts). You can see the high-fashion kick of Lacroix in a billowing, sleeveless fuchsia gown closed with grosgrain over a sheer dotted top and silk shorts, but it\u2019s tempered by Van Noten\u2019s practical sense of ease. I also liked the way the designers handled the historical elements, such as the Edwardian mutton sleeves and those beribboned 18th-century chemises \u2014 with a sense of fun and freedom, and certainly without couture linings and padding.\n\nPhoto: Victor Boyko/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to do the worst collection of his life because of me,\u201d Lacroix said at one point, with a laugh.\n\nVan Noten smiled. \u201cAnd for me, I didn\u2019t want him standing there as a kind of decorator of my collection. It really had to be a blend of creativity.\u201d\n\nSo it was.", "description": "Fashion critic Cathy Horyn reviews the unprecedented collaboration between Dries Van Noten and Christian Lacroix, as seen at Paris Fashion Week S/S 2020.", "authors": ["Cathy Horyn"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/27/27-cathy-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
