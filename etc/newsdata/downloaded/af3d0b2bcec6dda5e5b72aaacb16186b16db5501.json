Trump, facing a backlash from his party for acquiescing in the invasion, has backed punitive measures.\n\nOn Monday the EU declared an arms embargo on Turkey, and a planned bipartisan bill in Congress would sanction Turkish leaders and cut off US weapons supplies.\n\nErdo\u011fan has said he will respond aggressively to western attempts to isolate Turkey and has vowed not to halt the offensive.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to take our operation to the end. We will finish what we started,\u201d the Turkish leader said during a visit to Baku, Azerbaijan. \u201cA hoisted flag does not come down.\u201d\n\nThe presence of B61 nuclear gravity bombs at \u0130ncirlik airbase, which is about 100 miles from the Syrian border and which the US air force shares with its Turkish counterpart, is complicating Washington\u2019s calculations.\n\nIn recent days administration officials have been quietly reviewing plans to move the bombs, the New York Times reported on Monday. The report quoted a senior official as saying the bombs had become Erdo\u011fan\u2019s hostages and that flying them out of \u0130ncirlik would be the de-facto end of the Turkish-American alliance.\n\nPlans to remove the bombs have frequently been considered but never put into action. Officials are not supposed to discuss the existence of forward-deployed bombs in Turkey and four other Nato member states but they are an open secret. They are a cold war relic with no operational function in a war plan. To deploy them the US would have to fly in planes to carry them. Turkey has no planes certified to carry nuclear weapons.\n\nDiscussions within Nato over the past three decades about withdrawing them have foundered on opposition from member states including Turkey, who saw them as valuable symbols of US commitment to their defence through extended deterrent.\n\nA former official said there was considerable discussion in the Obama administration on what to do with the bombs, both because of Barack Obama\u2019s disarmament agenda and particularly over security fears after the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. The base was used by some of the plotters including a general who at one point sought protection with his US colleagues, which was denied. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government cut off power to the base before moving in to arrest suspects.\n\nAccording to one former official, Turkish diplomats responded to suggestions that the bombs might be removed by saying Turkey would develop its own nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cThe potential problems have been discussed for over a decade. And now we\u2019ve finally gotten to a point where this is a problem that we can\u2019t ignore any more,\u201d the former US official said.\n\nErdo\u011fan underlined that threat last month, declaring at a party rally that it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Turkey not to have its own arsenal. He claimed falsely: \u201cThere is no developed nation in the world that doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\nAs a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Turkey has committed not to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nAlexandra Bell, a senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-proliferation, said the Trump administration did not have confirmed officials in key posts that would normally be tasked with dealing with such nuclear dilemmas.\n\n\u201cThe president is sending out angry tweets and I don\u2019t think giving the proper amount of attention and concern to what is a potentially volatile situation,\u201d Bell said.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said: \u201cThe US doesn\u2019t need Turkey\u2019s agreement to remove the weapons. The US can do it unilaterally, and I think the US should do it unilaterally and do it immediately. If people are really concerned that this is going to somehow be the final nail in the coffin, it\u2019s kind of silly as the coffin is firmly nailed shut. The relationship is in total freefall.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vipin Narang, a nuclear expert and political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said removing the weapons would not be straightforward. \u201cExtracting them under these circumstances may be incredibly risky since it would involve removing 50 nuclear weapons from the vaults, moving them on a Turkish base and flying them out of Turkish airspace,\u201d Narang said. \u201cThey could be vulnerable to accidents, theft or attack.\u201d\n\nAs the Turkish offensive continues, Turkey\u2019s place in the Nato alliance has come under increasing strain. At a meeting on Monday, EU foreign ministers agreed to follow France and Germany\u2019s lead in ceasing arms sales to Turkey, while condemning Turkey for undermining \u201cthe stability and security of the whole region, resulting in more civilians suffering\u201d.\n\nAs most EU states are Nato members, Brussels had to turn to a lesser-used legal mechanism to stop weapons sales, prompting concerns of a pretend embargo. The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted the measures would have the same effect as a conventional arms embargo and promised EU officials would check on national enforcement of the ban.\n\nThe EU statement, which also described Turkey as \u201ca key partner\u201d, underlines Europe\u2019s dilemma over a military ally on its doorstep that shelters more than 3 million Syrian refugees and prevents would-be migrants from travelling to the EU under a 2016 pact. \u201cIt is not a kind of relationship that you can define as a black and white one; it is a complex multilayered, dimensional partnership,\u201d Mogherini said.\n\nThe British government initially opposed using the word \u201ccondemns\u201d in the EU statement but relented. EU diplomats played down the significance of the UK\u2019s late agreement: \u201cIt shows they have been otherwise engaged in the last few months and that they are already looking beyond their [EU] exit,\u201d one diplomat said. \u201cThat\u2019s legitimate.\u201d\n\nBritish officials, having long said privately that no departing member state should block EU decisions, were keen to stress the importance of acknowledging Turkey as a crucial partner in the region.", "description": "US officials said to be looking at moving nuclear devices as Congress plans sanctions", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2bc8a90c9a66318435fb8eae855dc73f0b0c40/0_164_4399_2639/master/4399.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9cd4cd7cfa0cc2d116ac82c071bde00e", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
