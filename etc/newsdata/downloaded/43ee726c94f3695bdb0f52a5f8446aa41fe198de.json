It's harder to change jobs, it's certainly harder to start a business.\n\n\"The pitch we have to make [to] the American people is, 'We will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.\"\n\nYang bringing up the stereotype didn't sit well with all viewers. CNN senior national correspondent Kyung Lah, a native of South Korea, tweeted she was \"annoyed.\"\n\n\"to a laughing room.\" I'm annoyed. \u2014 Kyung Lah (@KyungLahCNN) September 13, 2019\n\nThe comment, at the very least, got people talking.\n\nAndrew Yang saying he\u2019s Asian and knows a lot of doctors is a bit jarring. As an Asian American doctor, I\u2019ve seen my share of model minority stereotypes. But seeing an Asian guy on the presidential debate stage is the biggest source of pride I\u2019ve felt in a long time. #DemDebate \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 13, 2019\n\nWait...did Andrew Yang just say \"I'm Asian, so I know a lot of doctors?\"\n\n\n\nI never heard that stereotype before.#DemDebate\n\n\n\n\u2014 BrooklynDad_Defiant!
