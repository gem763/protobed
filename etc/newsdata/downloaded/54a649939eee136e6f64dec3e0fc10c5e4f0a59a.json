The \u201cFootloose\u201d star got poetic in the caption, writing, \u201c31 years today. Harmony. Heartbeats in time. Switching leads. And happy to play backup. I love u @kikkosedg.\u201d\n\nHe later posted a photo of a hand-drawn anniversary note and doodle from Sedgwick, captioning it, \u201cComing home [to] this beautiful work of art after a 12 hour trip is the antidote to jet lag.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s their secret to a lasting marriage? When Fox News asked Bacon this question in January, he offered a refreshing (though somewhat dissatisfying) response.\n\n\u201cThere is no secret,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve often had a couple of different one-liners for that answer, and then I decided that really the answer is I\u2019m not going to answer it because the last thing I want to do is come up with some quote that is going to summarize a 30-year relationship, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful to the relationship,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\nOne thing we know for sure: The couple still has the hots for each other. In June, Bacon admitted he has a hard time keeping his hands to himself when Sedgwick is on set directing \u201cCity on a Hill,\u201d the Showtime series in which he stars. But it looks like the attraction goes both ways.\n\n\u201cWhen [Bacon] walks into a room, I\u2019m still \u2015 I mean, my heart gets a little fluttery and I think, \u2019Oh! He\u2019s so cute. He\u2019s so hot.\u2032 That\u2019s literally the first thing I think,\u201d Sedgwick, who previously starred on the TNT drama \u201cThe Closer,\u201d told Redbook in 2012. \u201cYou can ask people on the set \u2014 it\u2019s palpable. He\u2019s still a mystery to me. And getting older together is scary and exciting.\u201d\n\nBacon and Sedgwick met on the 1988 TV movie adaptation of \u201cLemon Sky\u201d \u2014though they had briefly crossed paths years before \u2014 and went on to have two kids. Their son Travis is a composer and daughter Sosie is an actor you might recognize from Netflix\u2019s \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d", "description": "Two kids and an impressive 31 years of marriage later, the couple is still very much in love.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Huffpost Life"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ffcce3b00004900cd3d5a.png?cache=tPjLpmrO0b&ops=1778_1000"}
