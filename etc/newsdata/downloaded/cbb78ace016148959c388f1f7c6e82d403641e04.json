She had finished behind Russian Mariya Savinova, who was later disqualified for doping.\n\n\"Ask me how I'm feeling and it's still so mixed,\" Monta\u00f1o wrote in an Instagram post following the medal ceremony Monday. \"[O]verwhelmed is a word that's in there.\"\n\nAmerican runner Alysia Monta\u00f1o poses with one of the bronze medals she received Monday Michael Heiman / Getty Images\n\nMonta\u00f1o had placed fourth in both races, while Savinova took gold in 2011 and silver in 2013, robbing Monta\u00f1o of medals at back-to-back world championships. In 2017, Savinova was officially disqualified for using steroids and stripped of medals, including the 2012 Olympic gold for the 800 meter.\n\nOn \"60 Minutes\" in May 2016, Armen Keteyian reported on Russia's state-sponsored system of doping. He spoke with whistleblowers Vitaly and Yuliya Stepanov, a husband and wife team who exposed the dark secrets of their country's steroid program.\n\nYuliya, who had previously been one of Russia's elite runners, had secretly recorded her coach giving her steroids.
