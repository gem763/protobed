Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (D) campaign announced $4.5 million raised in the third quarter, but it admitted that it is not enough, touting a \u201cno-bullshit path for Beto\u201d moving forward.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign announced on Friday $4.5 million raised in the third quarter, putting him near the bottom of the barrel compared to his Democrat challengers. According to the campaign, 99 percent of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s donations were below $200, and the average donation was $26.\n\nThe campaign wrote:\n\nThey came from all 50 states, and nearly 20% of our donors gave to us for the first time this quarter. And most impressively, we did this while not fundraising during the 12 day period around the El Paso shooting because that tragedy wasn\u2019t about our campaign, it was about our community.\n\nHowever, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team admitted that the amount raised is \u201cnot what we thought we\u2019d be able to do given all of the other indicators we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters like what Beto has to say. When they meet him in person, they like him even more. In fact, our modeling shows a correlation between the counties Beto visits and an increase in his favorability,\u201d his campaign argued.\n\nThe campaign diagnosed the problem, writing, \u201cPeople think this is a two-person race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re stuck in what we\u2019ve been calling the \u2018Media Trap,\u2019 where the media is treating this race like it\u2019s over, despite the fact that only 9% of voters have made up their mind,\u201d it claimed, adding that it sees a \u201cno-bullshit path for Beto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see a no-bullshit path for Beto and for our people-powered campaign\u2014and a real, serious one,\u201d his campaign wrote. \u201cMore than that, though, we see that we need to bypass the media trap and we need to do it quickly.\u201d\n\nThe campaign outlined a few of the things that need to happen to help O\u2019Rourke break through. The plan includes launching an advertising blitz, beefing up national organizers, and focusing on early primary states.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s third-quarter haul pales in comparison to his competitors\u2019 numbers:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT): $25.3 million\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA): $24.6 million\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg (D): $19.1 million\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (D): $15.2 million\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): $11.6 million\n\nAndrew Yang (D): $10 million\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): $6 million\n\nMarianne Williamson (D): $3 million\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): $2.1 million\n\nThe current Real Clear Politics average shows O\u2019Rourke in seventh place with 1.8 percent support.", "description": "Beto's campaign announced $4.5 million raised in the third quarter, but admitted that it is not enough, touting a \"no-bullshit path\" forward.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1180325001-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
