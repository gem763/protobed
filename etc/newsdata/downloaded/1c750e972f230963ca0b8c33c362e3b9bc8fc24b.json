I'm really sad, because the bad things from this are going out to the world. That's what pains me most. I don't know what else to say.\"\"You know, it would have been nice if everyone had come out and banged on pots and protested other ways, but this? Not even during the time that we had the conflict with Pinochet did we touch the metro. Because we knew the metro was for us.\"Chaos in the country has affected many everyday aspects of life.Sporting and cultural events were canceled for the weekend,\u2026 and schools were shut on Monday and Tuesday.Flights were delayed or canceled at Santiago's international airport, and hundreds of passengers spent the night sleeping on the floor.South Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a travel warning for Chile on Monday, as protests are escalating into nationwide riots.Won Jung-hwan Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
