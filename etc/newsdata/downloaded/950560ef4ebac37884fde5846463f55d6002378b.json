she suffered a rope burn at the Sky High Sports trampoline park in Santa Clara, California (Picture: Google Maps)\n\nA father was falsely accused of sexually assaulting his five year-old daughter after she suffered a rope burn during a playground trip.\n\nDouglas Lother and his wife Danielle were grilled by police and social services after daughter was injured at Sky High trampoline park near their home in Mountain View, California, on January 25.\n\nThe couple are now suing police and social workers over an horrific ordeal which saw them ordered to forcibly strip-search their screaming child so a medic could examine her .\n\nThe girl, who Metro US has chosen not to name, was hurt after sliding down a rope swing with the rope between her legs.\n\nShe suffered some discomfort, with the Lothers themselves asking the girl if she\u2019d fallen victim to any kind of assault after she arrived home.\n\nMountain View officials will meet at the city\u2019s civic center tonight to discuss a lawsuit filed against the city following the family\u2019s ordeal (Picture: Google Maps)\n\nThey believed her when she said she hadn\u2019t, but noticed their daughter was \u2018crying and displaying extreme anxiety\u2019 when asked if they could see her injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter calling their local hospital the next morning and being told not to bring the girl in but keep an eye on her, the Lothers followed the advice and did so.\n\nTragic mother who lost two daughters dies in freak accident\n\nBut a Child Protective Services investigation was launched three days later when a teacher at the girl\u2019s school allegedly heard the youngster say she was no longer bleeding from her private parts.\n\nThe Lothers\u2019 attorney Bob Powell disputed the teacher\u2019s claim to have heard the child talk about \u2018Daddy touching her in her private parts.\u2019\n\nIt was taken seriously by social services, who turned up with cops at the Lothers\u2019 home that evening and pounded the door so hard Danielle feared they were about to suffer a home invasion.\n\nThe social workers then demanded to speak to the child, with Mountain View cop Mason Motomura allegedly breaking a rule by refusing to reveal why they were there, or share details of the allegations.\n\nThey took the child outside and questioned her in earshot of at least five strangers.\n\nAll family members were eventually quizzed, and repeated the same story about the rope swing.\n\nThe Lothers were then told that a paramedic would have to examine the girl.\n\nMotomura is said to have told the couple that if they refused, their daughter would be forcibly removed from their care.\n\nDespite pleading with officials not to traumatize their daughter by examining her, Motomura is said to have goaded the couple and told Danielle: \u2018This shows how you\u2019re not listening.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe allegedly told the couple \u2018We are not leaving until this is resolved.\u2019\n\nThat saw Douglas Lother snap: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not going to happen, so where are you guys sleeping,\u2019 the suit claims.\n\nThe Lothers eventually agreed to the examination in a bid to end their ordeal, with their child becoming \u2018hysterical and begging and crying not to proceed.\u2019\n\nShe screamed and \u2018struggled helplessly\u2019 as her parents forcibly stripped her.\n\nThe lawsuit continues: \u2018(The girl) continued to kick and struggle even more so after her clothes were removed, and her parents were thus forced to hold her arms and legs down and force her legs apart.\u2019\n\nDouglas Lother was forced to shine the light from his phone to allow the paramedic to see, and called the incident a \u2018nightmarish moment.\u2019\n\nA paramedic agreed the girl had nothing wrong with her, with the Lothers finally left alone.\n\nThey have now sued for $1million in damages over the distress they say was caused.\n\nTheir two daughters were reportedly too scared to sleep in their own beds afterwards, the Palo Alto Daily Post reported.\n\nThe girl whose injury prompted the investigation continues to have nightmares, and is terrified to go to school in case she is taken away by police.\n\nFamily spokesman Powell said: \u2018This was such a strong case that I can conceivably file a motion that would result in a pretrial ruling of liability and then only have to go to trial on damages.\u2019\n\nMountain View\u2019s City Council is set to meet on October 15 to discuss the case and protocol violations before commenting further.", "description": "Douglas and Danielle Lother suffered a nightmarish ordeal after their young daughter hurt herself while sliding down a rope swing", "authors":
