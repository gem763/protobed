Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nTracy Letts\u2019s Linda Vista is lovely, funny, and sad, and I\u2019m dreading the day when, like his earlier Superior Donuts, it becomes a sitcom. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that I wouldn\u2019t watch it, nor does it mean it\u2019d be a wholly terrible idea. Unfolding in episodic fashion across a number of mundane settings, Linda Vista follows the entanglements of the recently-single Dick Wheeler (Ian Barford), an eloquently embittered, constantly self-deprecating 50-year-old who has just left a cot in his estranged wife\u2019s garage and moved into a San Diego apartment complex.\n\nWheeler\u2019s contempt for the world around him makes for a lot of audience-friendly zingers: \u201cThe problem with these racist cocksuckers isn\u2019t that they\u2019re doing too much OxyContin, it\u2019s that they need to do a whole lot more,\u201d he says of Trump voters in the play\u2019s opening scene, which gets its share of applause. But his contempt for others is matched by his contempt for himself. He likes to joke that tales from his love life usually end with the words \u201cAnd he was humiliated.\u201d He\u2019s miserable, but entertainingly so; his attitude is a combination of ironic detachment and emotional predictability that you could easily imagine being applied to all sorts of real-world situations, like an aging hipster\u2019s guide to surviving a bad life.\n\nMuch of Linda Vista depicts Wheeler\u2019s attempts to restart his love life. He\u2019s not outwardly eager for companionship (\u201cI\u2019m too old to pretend to be something I\u2019m not and a lot of the things I am are not attractive,\u201d he grumbles), but he\u2019s clearly still prowling in his low-key, why-would-anyone-ever-date-me way. He asks out Anita (Caroline Neff), with whom he works at a camera store, but he\u2019s denied in a scene of disarming honesty. (\u201cI think we take turns blowing our lives up and right now it\u2019s your turn,\u201d she tells him.\u201d) At a bar, he chats up Minnie (Chantal Thuy), a beautiful twentysomething Vietnamese-American rockabilly enthusiast, even though much of their conversation winds up being about how they\u2019re not going to go out. His married friends Paul (Jim True-Frost) and Margaret (Sally Murphy), seemingly against their better judgment, set him up with Jules (Cora Vander Broek), a vivacious life coach with a graduate degree in \u201chappiness,\u201d and, after he spends most of their karaoke double-date complaining about how he hates everything, the two find themselves naked in bed together.\n\nFor all its easygoing pace and humor, Linda Vista goes to some truly dark places. The challenge here is to show how Wheeler\u2019s corrosive charm grows on people, how he wears them down with his languid, often entertaining negativity, while also revealing the toxicity and sense of entitlement that runs beneath his persona. In the end, he\u2019s just another jerk who expects the world to come to him, and leaves devastation in his wake. But that also makes him relatable; we\u2019ve all known our share of Wheelers, and most of us have probably been some variation of him at various points in our lives.\n\nLetts captures the indulgent, self-destructive appeal of completely checking out, of driving yourself down so far into the ground that even a kind word seems like a mocking offense. But he also reveals the inherent phoniness behind it. Wheeler may wallow in his self-loathing, but more often than not, he\u2019s secretly looking for something. A brutal scene where he breaks up with Jules, after she dares to give him a gift that he interprets as encouragement to pursue his aborted photography career, is an apocalypse of self-flagellation (\u201cI\u2019m a son-of-a-bitch, I\u2019m a misanthropic piece of shit, I should be taken out into a field and shot in the back of the head\u201d) \u2013 but we also know that he\u2019s leaving her because he\u2019s started hooking up with Minnie. In other words, he is a misanthropic piece of shit, just not in the specific way that he thinks he is.\n\nThese aren\u2019t particularly fresh characters or situations, but Dexter Bullard\u2019s staging and the Steppenwolf cast lend them an appealing physicality. A towering shambles, Barford\u2019s Wheeler lumbers and rolls through his scenes like the slow-moving train-wreck that he is. (In my memory of the play, he\u2019s always knocking down things \u2013 but I don\u2019t think he actually knocked down anything.) Vander Broek\u2019s Jules, by contrast, is alternately bouncy and hesitant; when she\u2019s not making quick, sudden movements, she\u2019s tensely holding back, like a person wary of getting hurt again but eager to put herself out there. This particular relationship makes for a transfixing dance \u2014 particularly during one post-coital argument played out mostly nude, enhancing their awkwardness and vulnerability. It\u2019s these kinds of subtly theatrical touches that make Linda Vista feel like a cohesive emotional experience, and not just a bunch of scenes designed to pass the time.\n\nLinda Vista is at the Helen Hayes Theater.", "description": "Review of \u2018Linda Vista\u2019 by Tracy Letts at the Hayes Theater, About Middle Age Gone Bad and Emotionally Vulnerable", "authors": ["Bilge Ebiri"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/10/10-linda-vista.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
