But it does not completely rule out a Halloween no-deal Brexit.\n\nMPs vote for an alternative\n\nUnder the bill - introduced by Labour MP Hilary Benn - Boris Johnson might have to request a Brexit extension on 19 October, pushing the deadline back to 31 January 2020.\n\nBut there are two scenarios in which he would not have to do this:\n\nMPs approve a Brexit deal in another meaningful vote (remember them?) MPs vote in favour of leaving the EU without a deal\n\nIn either of these scenarios, Mr Benn's law would not force any Brexit extension to be requested.\n\nCould the government ignore the law?\n\nThe bill states that it is the prime minister himself who would have to request an extension directly to the president of the European Council.\n\nIt even includes the exact wording of the letter.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson meets with president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, in August\n\nSo, theoretically, Mr Johnson could refuse to write or sign that letter. But that would almost certainly lead to court action.\n\nAt the final stage of the bill on Friday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan said the government would \"adhere to the law\".\n\nCould the government scrap the law?\n\nWith the current make-up of the House of Commons, the government would have little chance of repealing the new law.\n\nBut this could change if there is a general election before 19 October.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption If an election returned a majority for Boris Johnson, he could pass a new law that did not require him to seek an extension\n\nIf an election returned a House of Commons with a majority for Mr Johnson, he could potentially scrap the law and carry on without requesting an extension.\n\nCould the EU refuse?\n\nRegardless of what UK law says, any extension to Brexit has to be agreed to by all members of the EU.\n\nIt is possible that other European leaders are not convinced that they should grant the UK another delay.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: \"I'd rather be dead in a ditch\" than ask for Brexit delay\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been seen as a potential hurdle to any further Brexit delay.\n\nMr Johnson could also try to avoid an extension by persuading a member state to refuse his request.\n\nWhat if the EU asks for a different date?\n\nMr Benn's bill sets the length of any further extension to three months.\n\nBut if the other EU states respond with a different date, Mr Johnson would be forced to accept it unless MPs vote to reject it within two days.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Labour MP Hilary Benn's bill sets the length of any further extension to three months\n\nThis was a point of controversy during the passage of the bill, because some MPs and peers argued it could effectively force the UK to agree to whatever the EU asks for.\n\nIf MPs were to reject an alternative date, the UK could end up leaving without a deal.\n\nCould no deal happen in the future?\n\nThe new law tries to avoid a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, but it can't rule out a no-deal Brexit in the future.\n\nThere are only two ways to do that: pass and implement a withdrawal deal or cancel Brexit altogether.", "description": "A new law to avoid a no-deal exit has passed the House of Lords - but is no deal still possible?", "authors": ["Daniel Kraemer", "Bbc Political Research Unit"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/151F2/production/_108641568_b8f4525d-fcc7-445a-a510-3110a7ad21c2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
