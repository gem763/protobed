And they are happening in both the premium hearing aids that licensed hearing-care professionals sell for an average of $4,000 a pair, and in the moderately priced devices sold by online sellers and retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy . The latter includes FDA-approved hearing aids as well as personal sound amplification products, or PSAPs, that sell for about $30 to $400 and haven't undergone the FDA approval process. By law, any device that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration can\u2019t be marketed as treating hearing loss.\n\nBut that restriction is expected to end when the FDA releases new standards for over-the-counter hearing aids, possibly as soon as next year. The industry\u2019s expectation is that better-quality products that are now classified as PSAPs will be able to be sold as hearing aids and thus differentiate themselves from most other PSAPs, the \u201cvast majority of which are pretty much junk,\u201d says Nicholas Reed, assistant professor of audiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cRight now the system is stifling those companies because they can\u2019t call their products hearing aids.\u201d\n\nThe hope is that the new over-the-counter path will make hearing aids more accessible and affordable for the 38 million Americans who suffer from clinically significant hearing loss. Only about one in five people who would benefit from a hearing aid uses one, according to the Hearing Loss Association of America. The health impact is significant: Untreated hearing loss is associated with higher risks of dementia, depression and falls.\n\nMost insurers, including traditional Medicare, don\u2019t cover hearing aids\u2014making the devices unaffordable for many people. \u201cWith OTC products, people will have to do research, like buying a car,\u201d says Lisa Hamlin, director of public policy at the Hearing Loss Association. \u201cBut the generation entering their 40s and 50s and developing hearing loss is perfectly comfortable with technology and ordering products online. And the people who aren\u2019t will still go to their audiologist.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the latest innovations and a look at what\u2019s coming.\n\nWireless connectivity\n\nBluetooth technology, the international standard for wireless connectivity, is at the forefront of the revolution allowing hearing-aid users to do more with their devices.\n\nWhile Bluetooth is one of many wireless protocols found in hearing aids, it is the most common link to the consumer electronics that people use every day. People who use hearing aids equipped with Bluetooth technology can connect to Bluetooth-enabled smartphones, tablets, car stereos, computers, televisions and remote microphones and hear sounds directly in their ears.\n\n\u201cEven when things are loud enough, they are not particularly clear for people with hearing loss,\u201d says Christine Jones, vice president of audiology at the Phonak U.S. division of Swiss hearing-aid maker Phonak AG. \u201cSo a clear, rich signal directly into the ear is a big deal.\u201d\n\nExperts say music and television, for example, sound better when the hearing aid connects directly to the player through Bluetooth. Before Bluetooth started to be installed in hearing aids, wearers needed a separate piece of equipment, called a \u201cstreamer,\u201d to translate the Bluetooth signal from the other device or appliance into an FM signal or electromagnetic field that the hearing aid could understand. While Apple introduced a proprietary Bluetooth protocol for linking hearing aids to Apple devices in 2013, it wasn\u2019t until Phonak introduced its Marvel hearing aids in November 2018 that hearing-aid wearers could connect to Android phones and any other Bluetooth-enabled device without the use of a streamer. (Android phone users who don\u2019t have Marvel hearing aids still need to use a streamer.)\n\nConversation in a noisy environment can be more easily understood as well. In some situations, users have the option to connect their Bluetooth-enabled hearing aids to personal pen-sized microphones\u2014or even use their smartphone as a microphone\u2014to stream the voices they want to hear directly into their ear. In a noisy restaurant, for instance, they might pass their smartphone to a dinner partner to speak into.\n\n\u201cBluetooth technology is completely taking over the hearing-aid industry, and it is improving the way you can hear in almost any environment,\u201d says audiologist Cliff Olson in Anthem, Ariz. Dr. Olson, who has a doctorate of audiology, contributes to the hearing-aid review website HearingTracker.com.\n\nUsers of Marvel hearing aids with Bluetooth can answer their smartphones by tapping their hearing aids and have a hands-free conversation, just like an Apple AirPod wearer. They can stream audio and fine-tune the sound through an app on their smartphone.\n\nSuch apps are the hearing-aid control centers in this new environment of wireless connectivity. They feature volume controls and sound settings, and connect to hear the audio on personal electronics.\n\nPremium hearing aids from Oticon that use Bluetooth can connect to other electronic devices in the home through the so-called Internet of Things. Follow a few simple programming instructions on the device\u2019s smartphone app, and you could receive an alert in your hearing aid if your home-alarm system goes off, or when the doorbell rings. You could program your lights to turn on when you enter a room, or your phone to text a caregiver when the hearing-aid\u2019s battery is low.\n\n\u201cThere is an amazing world of possibilities,\u201d says David Copithorne, founder of the Hearingmojo blog and content director at Hearingtracker.com.\n\nHealth tracking and AI\n\nBecause hearing aids are worn 14 hours a day, and some connect to the internet, they have potential as health-tracking tools, an important benefit given the increased health risks for people with hearing loss.\n\nThe Livio AI, from Starkey Hearing Technologies, has gyroscopes and accelerometers that enable tracking of fitness information, like the Fitbit and Apple watch do. When worn in both ears, these devices have keen positional sensitivity that can tell if the wearer has fallen down or when they may have merely dropped one of the two aids. In the case of a fall, the Livio AI, which is linked to the wearer\u2019s cellphone, will send a text message with a map of the wearer\u2019s location to a caregiver. In future models, the company says the device will monitor blood pressure and track the wearer\u2019s gait looking for changes that might indicate fall risk.\n\nCurrent users of the Livio AI can connect to the app on their smartphone which tracks their exercise and movements throughout the day and compiles that data into a wellness score. The app encourages wearers to keep their bodies and minds active, which may reduce the risks of falls, cardiovascular disease and dementia, all of which are associated with hearing loss.\n\nThe AI component to the Livio AI also gives the hearing aid potential as a personal assistant. When paired with the smartphone app, the device can read aloud emails and texts straight into the user\u2019s ear, transcribe conversations onto the smartphone screen in real time and translate conversation spoken in another language. Users can also tap the device, ask a question and get an answer directly in their ear from Amazon\u2019s Alexa.\n\nRemote programming\n\nBeing fitted for a hearing aid by a hearing-care professional typically entails multiple office visits for a hearing test, programming, programming updates and support\u2014both technical and emotional\u2014for the wearer. (It can be difficult for a brain to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn\u2019t heard in years.) Premium hearing aids including those made by Phonak, Widex and Starkey now offer remote programming capabilities that enable a professional to tune a client\u2019s hearing aid through a computer or smartphone connection.\n\n\u201cWith the Phonak Marvel, my patients can be sitting in their living room. I can see them. They can see me, and I can read all the data off their hearing aids and make appropriate adjustments,\u201d says Dr. Olson, the Arizona audiologist. \u201cIt is a big improvement in convenience.\u201d\n\nDirect-to-consumer companies Eargo and iHear Medical both offer remote tuning on their hearing aids, which are shipped with preloaded programs. At Eargo a user can call up an audiologist who can tweak the hearing-aid programs or send a new one when consumers put their devices into their Bluetooth-enabled charging case. Hearing aids from iHear Medical can be remotely adjusted through a special USB cable attached to a computer.\n\nSelf-fitting hearing aids and hearables\n\nSelf-fitting\u2014when individuals set or alter programs on their hearing aids themselves using an app on a smartphone, tablet or computer\u2014is helpful for two things: to amplify only the frequencies that the user has difficulty hearing; and to customize settings for different situations, say in a restaurant, on a city street, or watching television.\n\nSound World Solutions sells a hearing aid and a PSAP with preset programs that can be customized through a smartphone app. Users pop the devices behind their ears, connect to their smartphone and take a hearing test. The app will play tones in varying frequencies, and users indicate which ones they can hear. Then the app will set new programs based on their results.\n\nSome self-fitting devices help with hearing but aren\u2019t hearing aids. These include Bose Hearphones and Nuheara IQ Buds Boost. Bose Hearphones are earbuds but have an attached collar that contains the battery and some electronic components. They stream audio, control background noise and amplify speech. Neither the Bose nor the Nuheara products went through the FDA-approval process required to be called hearing aids and are colloquially known as \u201chearables.\u201d Both are attracting people with mild to moderate hearing loss who aren\u2019t ready for full-fledged hearing aids.\n\n\u201cThe average age of our customer is 55,\u201d says David Cannington, co-founder of Nuheara. \u201cThe average age of a hearing-aid customer is early 70s.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Hearphones, at close to $500, and the IQ Buds Boost, at $350, cost more than wireless headphones, they cost a lot less than professionally fitted hearing aids and can be easily bought and programmed without an audiologist.\n\nResearch by Larry Humes, distinguished professor emeritus of speech and hearing sciences at Indiana University, suggests that more than half of people with hearing loss would be satisfied with the performance of a self-fitting hearing aid. \u201cIf half of the 80% of people with hearing loss who don\u2019t use hearing aids adopt self-fitting hearing aids, that would be a good outcome,\u201d says Prof. Humes.\n\nAnything that encourages people with hearing loss to adopt hearing devices earlier and to wear them more often will improve health outcomes. Currently people with hearing loss wait seven years before seeking help, according to the Hearing Loss Association of America.\n\n\u201cNow that hearing aids look and act like highly coveted consumer devices, we hope the benefits of wearing them will help overcome the stigma that has been associated with them,\u201d says Phonak\u2019s Ms. Jones.\n\nMs. Oliver is a writer in New York.
