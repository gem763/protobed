Good luck to him.\"\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker called him \"one of the great broadcasters\".\n\nEntrepreneur and former \"dragon\" Theo Paphitis from the BBC show Dragons' Den added it had been an \"emotional morning\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @TheoPaphitis An emotional morning as #JohnHumphrys hangs up his headphones for the last time\ud83c\udfa7He has been the voice of my morning for over 32 years. An incredible radio legacy with many political interviews under his belt. \u2014 Theo Paphitis (@TheoPaphitis) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell, who has had many a heated debate with Humphrys down the years, thanked him for his \"huge contribution to public service broadcasting in our country\", while admitting \"at times I could have brained you for your interruptions\".\n\n\"Your forensic interviews held us all to account enhancing our political debate,\" he added. \"Have a great retirement\".\n\nAnna Soubry MP, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, also paid tribute despite finding him \"occasionally annoying\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's David Sillito after Humphrys' last show, his former colleague Sue MacGregor admitted the famously irascible broadcaster could be \"grouchy\" but praised \"the absolutely forensic way in which he interviews politicians\".\n\nThe BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg declared it's \"been a privilege\" working with him.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @bbclaurak John\u2019s last big interview with David Cameron is fittingly today\u2019s 8.10 - been a privilege to have been (trying!) to answer his questions for the last 4 years explaining this crazy era in politics - only a sliver of his amazing career https://t.co/8igo0Wj1Pv \u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nMany more of the broadcaster's BBC colleagues and friends have been lining up to praise \"The Master\", describing today as a \"sad\" occasion.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @ChrisMasonBBC Listening to the Master one last time, I\u2019m reminded of one of my favourite books...his.

And for all those people who are so irreflectively sure he\u2019s pro or anti Brexit, or Lab or Con, I promise that I\u2019ve known him well for 42 years & have absolutely no idea. I suspect he\u2019s agin all sides. \u2014 John Simpson (@JohnSimpsonNews) September 18, 2019 Report\n\nSkip Twitter post by @EvanHD John Humphrys really deserves all the accolades. I found that the more I saw him at work on @BBCr4today close up, the more I respected him and understood why he had such enduring appeal. Way more to him than the adversarial interviews people talk about. #humphryslastday \u2014 Evan Davis (@EvanHD) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nElsewhere, Piers Morgan labelled Humphrys as \"the greatest radio interrogator of them all\".\n\nHis ITV colleague Robert Peston noted: \"You care about the craft in the way that not enough do\".\n\nMeanwhile Sky's Kay Burley also said she would miss him, urging the outgoing presenter to enjoy a lie-in after decades of early wake-ups on the current affairs breakfast show.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @piersmorgan 'My apologies if I've been a teeny-weeny bit grumpy...'\n\n- John Humphrys bows out from @BBCr4today after 32 gloriously irascible years.\n\nNo apology necessary.\n\nHe's been the greatest radio interrogator of them all, and will be hugely missed. \ud83d\udc4d pic.twitter.com/p1Hc6rBwz5 \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nSkip Twitter post by @Peston From one total obsessive to another, you will be missed John Humphrys.

He dragged it down to a radio version of the Daily Mail - it needs big change\n\n\n\nSo does BBC Question Time \u2014 Andrew Adonis (@Andrew_Adonis) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nTelegraph journalist Michael Deacon was clearly not a fan of Humphrys' interviewing technique.\n\nAnd campaigner Nicky Clark claimed that no departing female presenter would receive so much fanfare, saying: \"I'm not sure this would happen to a woman. Ultimately I'm sure it wouldn't.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @MichaelPDeacon Normally if an interviewer asks the same question again and again, it's because the politician hasn't answered it. John Humphrys asks the same question again and again even though the politician answered it five minutes ago, and is continuing to answer it now \u2014 Michael Deacon (@MichaelPDeacon) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nFormer Green Party leader Natalie Bennett tweeted she \"won't say anything\" about Humphrys' departure.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
