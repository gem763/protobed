The hospital encourages you to be in the room with your baby and we kind of naturally just got to the stage that we were ready to say goodbye and leave,\u201d Ami told Australian news website MamaMia.\n\n(Image: Ami Summers)\n\n\u201cIt was a hard moment because we were saying goodbye for good.\n\n\u201cWe had to leave the hospital empty handed. We left in a car that had a brand new car seat in the back and we came home to the nursery all set up. That was pretty difficult.\"\n\nAmi had to try and come up with her own way to deal with the grief.\n\n\"It's six to 12 months down the line that the grief sets in and you think, 'This is it. This is my first experience of motherhood.' This is not what we were expecting when we decided to get pregnant,\" the 38-year-old said.\n\n(Image: Ami Summers)\n\n(Image: Ami Summers)\n\n\"We kept her nursery set up for quite a while. It didn't feel right to take it down,\" she added.\n\n\"We would keep a light on in her room for a few weeks afterwards.\n\n\"I would find a lot of comfort in just sitting in there and just being in the space. I know that's not how all women feel, sometimes it's too painful, but it really became a sanctuary to me \u2013 where I could feel close to her.\"\n\nAfter the emotional drain of the stillbirth the couple eventually decided to try again.\n\nBut this time, however, Ami had a miscarriage at seven weeks.\n\nAnd two months later, Ami and Dave lost their third pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy, which resulted in an emergency operation and the loss of their baby as well as the loss of Ami's right fallopian tube.\n\n(Image: Ami Summers)\n\n(Image: Ami Summers)\n\nThey were told they would have trouble conceiving again but they defied the odds and fell pregnant six months later.\n\nAmi said: \"Pregnancy after loss is a whole new journey.\n\n\"It's such a stressful experience but at the same time, you can't get away from the reminders. I think the only way for me to deal with it was to really surrender to it and face it.\"\n\nAmi made it to 34 weeks when she was rushed to emergency with a catastrophic spontaneous abdominal hemorrhage. After an emergency caesarean, Ami's son Indy was born.\n\n(Image: Ami Summers)\n\nAlthough Ami was put in a coma for 24 hours, she was finally reunited with her son after three days spent apart.\n\nAmi has written a book about her experiences with pregnancy loss called Heart Space.", "description": "Ami Summers and husband Dave were excitedly waiting for their first child together but Arla Summers McCarthy was stillborn", "authors": ["Tom Davidson", "Image", "Ami Summers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ami-Summers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
