Soto, sitting on a stool in front of his locker, had a package delivered, and Kendrick picked it up.\n\n\u201cLook, it says Washington Nationals Player of the Century,\u201d Kendrick joked.\n\nLike I said, he may have predicted the future.\n\nSoto continued to write his name in the 21st-century record book by driving in three runs Monday night and leading the Nationals to a 5-4 Game 1 World Series win over the Astros before a silenced crowd of 43,339 fans who didn\u2019t come to see the young star manhandle their Cy Young candidate starter, 20-game winner Gerrit Cole.\n\nBut that\u2019s just what Soto, the second-year Dominican outfielder who turns 21 on Friday, did \u2014 blasting a mammoth solo home run off Cole, followed by a two-run double, giving the Nationals what they needed off a pitcher who came into the game having won all three of his postseason starts and allowing just 1 earned run in 22 2/3 innings pitched.It\n\nIt was a daunting task for Washington, a wild-card team in its first World Series, facing a Houston team that won the World Series two years ago, made it to the American League Championship Series last year and had a 107 regular season games this year.\n\nThe Nationals came into the game talking about having fun \u2014 their modus operandi throughout the postseason \u2014 while the heavily favored Astros spoke of how \u201cmature\u201d their team was. They had the aura of a team about to take care of business, and the Nationals seemed ripe to be overwhelmed by the moment.\n\nWith their ace, Max Scherzer, on the mound struggling, allowing two runs in the first inning on an RBI double by Yuli Gurriel for a 2-0 Astros lead, and Houston\u2019s ace, Cole, on the mound, that overwhelming moment had appeared to arrive.\n\nNot hardly.\n\nRyan Zimmerman made Cole looked vulnerable with his solo blast over the left field wall in the second inning to cut the Astros lead to 2-1. Then came Soto\u2019s fourth inning solo moon shot over the left field wall and his fifth-inning two-run double, reducing Cole to a victim.\n\nThis could be the national coming out party for Soto, for those who may have not yet seen the Washington Nationals Player of the Century. He has the charisma to match his talent, and if Fox is searching for baseball stars for this World Series show, they have found one in Soto. This kid doesn\u2019t shrink from the limelight. He thrives on it.\n\nHis 34 home runs this season were tied for the second-most by a 20-year-old in Major League Baseball history, behind Mel Ott, who hit 42 in 1929. That\u2019s 90 years ago. He is also tied for career home runs by a player before his 21st birthday, with 56, along with Tony Conigliaro, behind Ott with 61.\n\nBut there is so much more to Soto than the numbers. His dance in the batters box \u2014 the \u201cSoto shuffle\u201d \u2014 his smile and enthusiasm that has influenced this veteran clubhouse. He is MLB\u2019s marketing dream. He may be Mike Trout with personality.\n\nA stretch? It\u2019s not my comparison. Hear it from the guy who played four seasons with Trout with the Los Angeles Angels.\n\n\u201cThe guy wants to win,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cHe loves the game. He goes 0 for 4 and he\u2019s right back at it. I played with another guy like that. His name is Mike Trout just had a great attitude every single day. I see a lot of those similarities in Juan.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Juan Soto World Series, the Washington Nationals Player of the Century.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
