A state regulator called the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) has concluded the owner of Cider Riot, Abram Goldman-Armstrong, should face administrative charges for his behavior that day:\n\nThe investigators allege Goldman-Armstrong, who was at Cider Riot during the altercation, photographed patrons using \u201cillegal weapons\u201d. He was also aware of multiple people getting injured throughout the confrontation, which lasted more than a half-hour. \u201cGoldman-Armstrong stated that his patrons were only acting in self-defense but clearly, according to the video, he was present and watching as patrons displayed aggressive behavior,\u201d wrote state inspector Genny Welp. The Cider Riot owner never tried to remove these patrons from his pub, investigators allege, which state rules require. He and the security guard working that day, Joseph LeVasseaur, also provided false statements, the investigators allege in the report\u2026 The report recommends Cider Riot\u2019s owner and staff to be charged with providing false statements, failure to evict and permitting unlawful and disorderly activity, all state alcohol license violations. A charge of destroyed or concealed evidence also appears in the report, but the details of that allegation are redacted.\n\nSeveral members of the group Patriot Prayer have been arrested and charged for their involvement in the riot that day, including founder Joey Gibson. Additionally, Goldman-Armstrong has filed a $1 million lawsuit against Gibson and the group.\n\nBut regardless of what happens with the lawsuit or the regulator\u2019s report, Goldman-Armstrong may not be the owner of Cider Riot for much longer. Last week he put his business and the Cider Riot brand up for sale:\n\nIn an interview, Goldman-Armstrong said a costly expansion in 2016 coupled with cider sales below what he and his investors had projected left them with little choice other than to put their facility, equipment and brand on the market. The cidery had previously cut staff and Goldman-Armstrong, who started Cider Riot in his North Tabor neighborhood garage in 2013, said he hadn\u2019t drawn a paycheck in three years. \u201cWe never had deep pockets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was always a bootstrap kind of enterprise. And we were left with a lot of overhead.\u201d\n\nGoldman-Armstrong claims the sale has nothing to do with the riot. Earlier this month he was banned from Providence Park for displaying an Iron Front symbol at a soccer game.", "description": "\"he was present and watching as patrons displayed aggressive behavior\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Portland-Antifa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
