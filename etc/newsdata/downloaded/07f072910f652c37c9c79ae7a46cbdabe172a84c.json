The post has been updated and revised to describe the bill as introduced and to incorporate additional material.\n\nThe House of Representatives this week will begin acting on a bill that would limit Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving medicines, impede the development of new treatments for deadly and debilitating diseases, and increase health spending over the long term.\n\nThe Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019 (H.R. 3), introduced last week with the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would double down on the failures of existing government policies that have distorted prescription drug prices and contributed to higher health care costs.\n\nTwo House committees (Energy and Commerce and Education and Labor) will hold hearings on the bill this week. Pelosi is reportedly aiming for a House floor vote prior to Thanksgiving.\n\nH.R. 3 would establish a system in which the U.S. government bases prices for cutting-edge drug treatments on those set by foreign governments.\n\nThe measure would set an upper price limit at 1.2 times a drug\u2019s average price in six other countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom).\n\nThe secretary of health and human services then would seek to \u201cnegotiate\u201d prices below that upper limit for at least 25\u2014and as many as 250\u2014drugs each year.\n\nThe prices resulting from these \u201cnegotiations\u201d would be applied throughout the U.S. market. The government would require manufacturers to offer that price to private, as well as public, payers or face massive fines.\n\nA manufacturer that declined to negotiate the price of any of its products would incur an excise tax of up to 95% of the revenues it derived from that product in the preceding year.\n\nH.R. 3 also would confiscate money from manufacturers for pricing actions they took place years before H.R. 3 became law. The health and human services secretary would collect \u201crebates\u201d from manufacturers to the extent they have raised the price of any Medicare-covered drug since 2016 by an amount that exceeds the general inflation rate.\n\nUnprecedented Government Power\n\nThe bill represents an unprecedented exercise of raw government power.\n\nThe federal government already imposes price curbs across a range of programs, requiring manufacturers to pay the government rebates in Medicaid and the \u201c340B\u201d program, and discounts in Medicare, as well as to make various price concessions in the Veterans Affairs health system.\n\nThese provisions all are confined to federal programs, but nonetheless have distorted drug prices throughout the health sector.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for the government to dictate the prices it pays in programs it finances. It is quite another for the government to impose a price for a product\u2019s private sale and to extract money from a company on a long-ago settled transaction.\n\nMajor Impact on Access to Care\n\nProponents of H.R. 3 claim that it would have no adverse effect on innovation or on access to pharmaceuticals. But aggressive government price-setting has damaged innovation and limited access to new treatments in all six of the countries whose price controls the bill would import.\n\nIf the U.S. adopts price controls, it risks the same results here.\n\nAccess to new drugs is much greater in the U.S. than in countries with price controls, in part because of having shunned price controls.\n\nOf new active substances introduced between 2011 and 2018, 89% are available to Americans, compared with 62% in Germany and 60% in the United Kingdom. One-half or more of these new therapies are unavailable to Australian, Canadian, French, and Japanese patients.\n\nThis lack of access can have damaging effects. A study by IHS Markit examined outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality in the U.S. and the world. The report compared how Americans with that disease fared, compared with citizens of other highly developed countries, including Australia, Canada, France, and the U.K.\n\nThe study concluded that Americans gained 201,700 life years as a result of faster access to new medicines. Half those gains would have been wiped out, the study found, if Americans had the same limited access to those treatments as patients in other countries.\n\nPatients will be worse off if Washington emulates the price control regimes of foreign governments.\n\nHindering Innovation\n\nCountries with price controls also suffer a decline in pharmaceutical research and development.\n\nIn 1986, European firms led the U.S. in spending on pharmaceutical research and development by 24%. After the imposition of price control regimes, they fell behind. By 2015, they lagged the U.S. by 40%.\n\nIf the U.S. emulates the European price-setting example, innovation here almost certainly will suffer.\n\nTrading innovation and access to new medicines in exchange for lower prices on existing products may strike some as a good deal. But according to the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, it wouldn\u2019t be.\n\nThe council concluded that while price controls might save money in the short term, they would cost more money in the long run. Government price-setting, it wrote, \u201cmakes better health care costlier in the future by curtailing innovation.\u201d\n\nOne Redeeming Idea Worthy of Consideration\n\nH.R. 3 does contain at least one potentially constructive provision; namely, a restructuring of the Medicare Part D drug benefit.\n\nTitle III of the measure would rework how the Part D program pays for the costliest drugs, relieving taxpayers of some of these costs and capping the amount seniors would pay out of their own pocket for prescription medicines.\n\nA bill favorably reported last July by the Senate Finance Committee contains a similar provision.\n\nThe H.R. 3 version of this Part D restructuring, while potentially promising, requires revision. Other provisions in the measure\u2014including the imposition of government price controls\u2014should be removed. They would strike at the heart of the Part D program\u2019s success.\n\nUnlike other government programs, Part D relies on private markets\u2014instead of government \u201cnegotiation\u201d and bureaucratic fiat\u2014to set drug prices. This market-based approach has contained Medicare spending on drugs and saved the program money on doctor and hospital care.\n\nCongress Should Go Back to the Drawing Board\n\nH.R. 3 would discard market-based reforms in favor of government price controls. In adopting the failed policies (and the government-set prices) of six foreign governments, it puts Americans at risk of reduced access to cutting-edge treatments and higher health costs in the long term due to a decline in innovation.\n\nAs drafted, H.R. 3 is a prescription for disaster and a missed opportunity to address the real reasons that government policies have led to higher drug costs for Americans.", "description": "An earlier version of this post was based on a summary of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s prescription drug pricing bill that was leaked to the press prior to the bill\u2019s introduction.
