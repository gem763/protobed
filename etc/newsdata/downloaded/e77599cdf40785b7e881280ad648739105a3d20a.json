And as disruption goes, it was not in the same class as the Gatwick villain.\n\n\u201cWe just have to improvise with plan B,\u201d goes the commentary on the group\u2019s video. \u201cHolding the drone at head height. Not drone flying, but drone holding.\u201d\n\nHeathrow Pause blamed electronic jamming by the Met. The police declined to comment on this assertion, which I interpret (perhaps wrongly) as meaning: \u201cYour drone was a dud, pal. We wouldn\u2019t dream of transmitting jamming signals in close proximity to an active runway, but if you want to think we did, please do.\u201d\n\nNinety minutes later, Qantas flight 9 swept in from Perth \u2013 the perfect exemplar of the problem that Heathrow Pause wants to tackle. The aircraft burns a prodigious amount of fuel on its 9,000-mile, 17-hour journey.\n\nThe impact of aviation on the environment, and how to reduce it, is a critical debate. But climate change activists who engage in direct action are choosing a counter-productive and potentially dangerous course.\n\nOne long-haul captain told me on Thursday: \u201cI am flying to Heathrow and I will load extra fuel in case I need to hold and then divert because of the drones.\u201d So the mere threat of disruption led directly to a rise in CO2.\n\nHad the action been successful in halting inbound flights, the increase would have been spectacular because of the requirement to fly to an alternative airport and, when the threat had subsided, take off again for Heathrow.\n\nAs well as the self-defeating nature of the protest, there is more alarming prospect. Air traffic controllers in southeast England are highly trained professionals who coordinate the most complex skies in the world. The task is quite challenging enough in normal times; deliberate disruption by deployment of drones adds to their workload and inevitably erodes safety margins.\n\nDisruption can have unintended consequences.\n\nLet me remind you of the circumstances of the world\u2019s worst air disaster. It happened on the island of Tenerife in 1977. Flights had been diverted there after a small bomb exploded at Las Palmas airport on the neighbouring island of Gran Canaria.\n\nIn the disarray that followed, a tragedy of miscommunication led to a collision between two Jumbo jets and the deaths of 583 people.\n\nNot for a moment do I compare the motives and methods of Heathrow Pause to those of terrorists. I have no doubt that the climate change activists are driven by the purest of motives, to draw attention to the damage caused to the planet by air travel. But they meddle in aviation at their peril \u2013 and potentially that of others.", "description": "By the time the sun crept over the eastern end of the runways at Heathrow on Friday morning, one thing was clear: whoever closed the runway at Gatwick before Christmas by flying a drone\u00a0was highly professional as well as malicious.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/16/dronearrest.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
