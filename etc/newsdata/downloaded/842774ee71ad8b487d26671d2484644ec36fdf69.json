And it clears the way for the Environmental Protection Agency to finish a follow-up regulation in the coming months that could leave most of the nation's wetlands without any federal safeguards.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is poised to sign off on the repeal at the D.C. headquarters of the National Association of Manufacturers, one of the industry groups that had opposed the Obama administration's Waters of the U.S. rule. That 2015 regulation, also known as the Clean Water Rule, had cemented federal protections for headwater streams, Western rivers and nearby wetlands, in an effort to resolve questions raised by two muddled Supreme Court decisions.\n\nEnvironmental groups vowed to challenge the rollback, arguing that it jeopardizes drinking water supplies for 117 million Americans.\n\nJon Devine, director of federal water policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, defended the Obama administration rule in a statement, saying it \"represented solid science and smart public policy.\"\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s wild-eyed attempts to reward polluters, however, knows no bounds, so it is repealing these important protections without regard for the law or sound science,\" he said. \"This unsubstantiated action is illegal and will certainly be challenged in court.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers and industry groups argue that the Obama-era rule represented a vast federal overreach that intruded upon states' authority to regulate their own waterways.\n\n\"This action officially ends an egregious power grab and sets the stage for a new rule that will provide much-needed regulatory certainty for farmers, home builders, and property owners nationwide,\" Wheeler wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register this morning.\n\nThursday's action represents the first step in a major rollback of Clean Water Act protections that President Donald Trump had directed in an executive order shortly after coming into office.\n\nIn repealing Obama's rule, Wheeler's action restores earlier regulations that had governed Clean Water Act permitting before 2015. Both environmentalists and industry groups have complained that the pre-2015 rules are laborious and lead to inconsistent decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is crafting a subsequent regulation that it hopes to finish before the end of the year to replace those rules with a much narrower definition of the types of streams and wetlands that are subject to Clean Water Act permitting requirements. By one early estimate from federal regulators, more than half the wetlands now protected would fall out of jurisdiction under the Trump administration\u2019s approach, which would eliminate nearly all federal protections for waterways in arid states like Arizona.\n\nThursday\u2019s rule is unlikely to create major changes on the ground right away because courts have put the Obama-era rule on hold in more than half the states.\n\nNonetheless, the move represents a big win for industry groups that say that the Clean Water Act permitting process is often one of the most onerous aspects of their projects. Permits to fill in streams and wetlands can require developers to shrink or change the footprint of a project and pay to counteract the damage they do to waterways.\n\nIn fact, industries' fight to shrink the scope of the water law began shortly after Congress passed it in 1972. Although farmers are exempt from major portions of the law, the American Farm Bureau Federation has been the most prominent advocate of rollbacks, arguing that everyday farming activities like spraying fertilizer could trigger permitting requirements.\n\nUltimately, legal experts broadly agree that the question of how far the Clean Water Act\u2019s protections reach is unlikely to be settled until the Supreme Court takes up the issue again, and it may take several more years for litigation to reach that stage.\n\nWhen the high court last addressed the issue, in 2006, the nine justices were unable to reach an agreement. Four conservative justices led by Antonin Scalia endorsed a narrow approach to federal jurisdiction, the four liberal justices backed an inclusive approach, and then-Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote his own, stand-alone opinion that said any waterway with a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d to larger rivers downstream warranted federal protection.\n\nFollowing that decision, the George W. Bush administration directed EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, which issues permits for filling in wetlands, to follow Kennedy\u2019s test by making case-by-case decisions on the ground about whether individual streams or wetlands have a \u201csignificant nexus.\u201d This is the approach that Thursday's action reinstates.\n\nBut Trump's February 2017 executive order directed his agencies to craft a new approach that embraced Scalia\u2019s narrower take on the reach of Clean Water Act authority.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court\u2019s make-up has changed significantly since justices last addressed the issue, legal experts say a rule pegged to Scalia's approach could receive a very different reception now. When Kennedy retired in 2018, he was replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has been skeptical of agency actions that go beyond a strict interpretation of the authorities granted by Congress. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who replaced Scalia, has also taken a limited view of federal power in line with his predecessor.", "description": "EPA's action is a victory for farmers, coal miners, home developers and oil producers.", "authors": ["Annie Snider"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6f/a4/6e6a6c5845a189c05a4ec628219f/180406-ep-gty-1160.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
