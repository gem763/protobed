Heartbroken, I signed the separation agreement that listed Zoe between \u201celectric salt and pepper shaker\u201d and \u201cred bowl\u201d on the inventory of Jim\u2019s property. Then she was gone, living with Jim in a new town 65 miles away.\n\nA few weeks later came another email from Jim: \u201cI am not suggesting I want to do this, but would you be interested in Zoe full time?\u201d Without missing a beat, I replied, \u201cyes,\u201d which led him to disclose that his new townhouse wasn\u2019t dog-friendly. Although our legal agreement was signed and recorded, I took full custody of Zoe. I understood the implications of my \u201cwin\u201d when Jim wrote again, declaring that he wouldn\u2019t pay for any of Zoe\u2019s care \u201cbecause I won\u2019t ever see her again.\u201d Or me, as it\u2019s turned out so far.\n\nI consider myself lucky to spend my days with Zoe now. After years of caring for my parents, both died within months of my and Jim\u2019s legal separation, I needed that little \u201cterrier-ist\u201d more than ever. Smiling more than snarling, and now two weeks shy of 17, she plays a daily game of \u201ckill the squirrel,\u201d where she chases those show-off rodents in the front yard with every expectation of capture. So far, the squirrels are winning. Zoe and I are victorious in our own way \u2014 we got what was best for us, no $16,000 payment required.", "description": "", "authors": ["Steven Petrow", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday Dog-Divorce.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
