NY Times WH correspondent pours gasoline on the paper\u2019s own \u2018dumpster fire of an article\u2019 about Brett Kavanaugh", "language": "en", "text": "As you might be aware, a New York Times article from Sunday has since been amended to include the not-so-small detail that the alleged victim does not recall any such incident. That update nukes the whole NYT article that some Democrats are trying to use to gin up \u201cimpeach Kavanaugh\u201d support:\n\nWe report tonight the real bombshell: Christine Ford\u2019s close HS friend (who Ford says was at the party when Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her) said Ford\u2019s story is not believable and told the FBI Ford\u2019s allies pressured her, threatened her with a smear campaign to say otherwise https://t.co/GQhBTXHcze \u2014 Jan Crawford (@JanCBS) September 17, 2019\n\nBut the authors of the Times\u2019 article that has backfired also wrote an anti-Kavanaugh book, which is, ironically, where Mollie Hemingway spotted the HUGE omission from the article in the Times. For some reason, the NYT\u2019s WH correspondent Maggie Haberman wanted to highlight that for any media pointing out the omission from the Times\u2019 article:\n\nthat information was also said to the same NYT reporters https://t.co/86yArtDf96 \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 17, 2019\n\nEr, yeah, and that\u2019s the problem:\n\nWeird that it was in their book but left out of their big article! https://t.co/cmckcusZL2 \u2014 Peter J. Hasson (@peterjhasson) September 17, 2019\n\nStrange, right?\n\nAnd they buried it. \u2014 Educat\u00ebdHillbilly\u2122 (@RobProvince) September 17, 2019\n\nlololol \u201cwe had this news, too. we just chose instead to highlight our retreading of the New Yorker\u2019s Ramirez coverage, offering nothing new despite packaging it that way.\" \u2014 T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) September 17, 2019\n\nlove to act indignant when a competing newsroom exercises better editorial judgment \u2014 T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) September 17, 2019\n\nBuried the lede so far that it was never even in the story. https://t.co/nmCEAdMoLV \u2014 David Martosko (@dmartosko) September 17, 2019\n\nAnd then\u2026someone on the Times went out of their way to bury it. That is PRECISELY the problem. https://t.co/AqW0IffbF8 \u2014 Pradheep J. Shanker (@Neoavatara) September 17, 2019\n\nRight?\n\nThey certainly didn't seem to think it was very important. \u2014 Hey, guys (@jtLOL) September 17, 2019\n\nAnd it would have stayed buried without @MZHemingway . \u2014 Pouncing Coder Brad (@bradcundiff) September 17, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s very likely.\n\nfunny that it was in there book and they left it out of this dumpster fire of an article. WHY? Who made them do that? \u2014 Blackbeard (@SidtheKidd87) September 17, 2019\n\nWow! This dumpster fire is burning so hot even Maggie can't ignore it! \u2014 Jack Daley (@RealJackDaley) September 17, 2019\n\nThis tweet is something!
