A simulcast of the 2019 Indspire Awards will broadcast on CBC Radio, CBC Television and CBC Gem on June 23, 2019 at 8 p.m. (8:30 p.m. NT).\n\nIn celebration of Indigenous Book Club Month and National Indigenous History Month, Hager shared a book she found powerful: Son of a Trickster by Eden Robinson.\n\n\"I was raised by a single mother who was always moving us from place to place in hopes of finding the perfect town, the perfect job and the perfect stepfather. In Son of a Trickster, Eden Robinson has conjured up a dysfunctional, wacky extended family headed by a mother who is either loving her son Jared too hard or leaving him to be raised by wolves. There's a scene or three in the book that seemed eerily familiar to me, and no doubt to others from Indigenous families who moved around a lot and often felt like aliens in school. Son of a Trickster captures that seismic shift that happens when modern life crashes into the ancient ways. When I heard that Eden's book was being adapted into a television series for CBC, I was ecstatic. The Indigenous film community has fought tirelessly for decades to see an Indigenous written and directed dramatic series on network television. I am not surprised that it is Eden Robinson's Son of a Trickster that has broken down the doors for us.\"", "description": "Barbara Todd Hager is the recipient of the 2019 Indspire Arts Award in recognition of her career in writing and television production, including directing the docuseries 1491: The Untold Story of the Americas Before Columbus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5183435.1561056748!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/barbara-todd-hager-recommends-son-of-a-trickster-by-eden-robinson.png"}
