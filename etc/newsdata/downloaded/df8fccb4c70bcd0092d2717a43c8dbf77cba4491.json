The 27-year-old outfielder has hit 13 home runs for Chicago in 35 games. That\u2019s two more than he hit in 100 games this season for the Tigers.\n\nCastellanos has hit six home runs at Wrigley Field after hitting only three at Comerica this year.\n\nCastellanos could be crucial for the Cubs down the stretch. They dropped the final three games of a series against Milwaukee and lead the Brewers by just two games for the second wild card in the National League. Philadelphia is also two back, and surging Arizona is 1\u00bd behind after winning 11 of 13.\n\nChicago has injury problems. Shortstop Javier B\u00e1ez is dealing with left thumb issues, and closer Craig Kimbrel has had elbow inflammation. If the Cubs do make the postseason, they can thank Castellanos.\n\nNot every big trade at the deadline has paid dividends. Marcus Stroman has a 5.05 ERA in seven starts for the New York Mets. Yasiel Puig has only two home runs in 33 games for Cleveland. Zack Greinke is 4-1 for Houston, but he\u2019s posted a 3.86 ERA since being traded to the Astros and hasn\u2019t really been dominant.\n\nCastellanos is the acquisition who has really made a difference. He\u2019s hit .338 for the Cubs with an OPS of 1.056.\n\nIn another interesting twist from those deadline deals, the Diamondbacks traded Greinke and still might make the playoffs. Alex Young struck out 12 on Saturday for a team rookie record, allowing two hits in eight innings in a 2-0 win over Cincinnati. Young is 7-3 with a 3.38 ERA on the season.\n\nElsewhere around the majors:\n\nGOOD TIMING\n\nWhen Miami left-hander Brian Moran came in to make his big league debut Thursday night, he had a familiar face waiting for him.\n\nThe second batter Moran faced was his brother, Colin, a third baseman for the Pirates. Brian struck out Colin and ended up getting the win in relief when the Marlins won 10-7.\n\nBLOWOUT\n\nThe Astros and Dodgers are neck and neck for the major league lead in run differential. Houston now occupies the top spot after a 21-1 rout of Seattle on Sunday. Houston hit 11 doubles and improved to 16-1 against Seattle this year.\n\nThe Astros beat Baltimore 23-2 earlier this season. They\u2019re the first team to win two games by 20 or more runs in a season since the New York Yankees did it three times in 1939, according to STATS.\n\nHIGHLIGHT\n\nThe Mets have given the Nationals fits at times this year, but that changed in a big way Tuesday night when Washington scored seven runs in the bottom of the ninth, beating New York 11-10 on Kurt Suzuki\u2019s three-run homer. Right now, the Nationals appear likely to make the playoffs and the Mets don\u2019t - and this loss will stand out if New York doesn\u2019t make it.\n\nEdwin Diaz gave up the winning homer. He has blown seven saves and allowed 14 homers in 60 games.\n\nLINE OF THE WEEK\n\nGerrit Cole wasn\u2019t about to be overshadowed by Houston\u2019s staggering offensive display Sunday. In that 21-1 win, he struck out 15 and allowed only one hit in eight innings. Cole has won 12 straight decisions.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nicholas Castellanos has evidently found a ballpark that suits him.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/cubs_brewers_baseball_82228_c0-157-2532-1633_s1770x1032.jpg?af0dd79227919a7731e09614c5aee4ce31246f08", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
