The most recent of those came when he unified two 175lbs titles via a 10th-round knockout over Ukrainian WBC champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk in Philadelphia, adding to his bright red IBF belt.\n\nThe similarities between Beterbiev and the 28-0 UFC darling extend far beyond nationality and occupation: both are legitimate, unified champions boasting unblemished professional records in their respective disciplines and currently hold the number one spot in their corresponding weight categories.\n\nMost notably of all - both have captivated audiences with their almost alarming indifference to violence. Despite being outwardly easygoing and jovial when outside of the combat arena, both Beterbiev and Khabib posses fight-time personas that elicit fear and intrigue from opponents and spectators in equal measure.\n\nNow based in Montreal, Canada, and of Chechen heritage, the 34-year-old Beterbiev has fallen into a friendship with local mixed martial arts all-time great Georges St. Pierre, whom he considers a \u201cmentor\u201d.\n\nThe experience of the former welterweight and middleweight UFC champion has undoubtedly aided Beterbiev\u2019s transition from former Olympian and world amateur champion to negotiating the professional world rankings and now in North America. So far, that has involved delivering world titles with bludgeoning knockouts.\n\nBeterbiev's partnership with GSP also brings another link to Khabib; the former UFC star is a hero of the UFC 155lbs supremo, and the two have repeatedly expressed their desire to meet one day in the octagon, which forms the main motivation for a mooted St. Pierre comeback.\n\nAs for Beterbiev, his next step is to become undisputed champion after his win over Gvozdyk catapulted him to the pinnacle of his weight class. To do that, it will mean meeting either compatriot and WBA title holder Dmitry Bivol or the winner of a fight between another Russian Sergey Kovalev\u2019s fight against Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for the WBO title.\n\nThose three Russians own all four organization belts and have been revered for their inhuman punching power. To varying degrees each have also, as common in Western press, suffered to under-exposure and have more often been portrayed as hell-raising anti-heroes.\n\nDespite the lack of sufficient coverage perhaps depriving Beterbiev of the required platform to showcase his skills, the 34-year-old has, however unwittingly, emerged as a star of the sport. His win over Gvozdyk saw the mallet-fisted Beterbiev claim the Ring magazine belt and earn a top 10 ranking in the \u2018Bible of Boxing\u2019 pound for pound rankings.\n\nIt was Bivol who labeled his contemporary the most dangerous man anyone in the sport. Such a statement carries extra weight when said by someone who not only has first hand experience of elite boxing, but someone regarded in the same vein.\n\nAs for Kovalev, Beterbiev already holds two wins over the three-time world champ, who is considered a little on the downside after his last fight, trudging to a stoppage win over Brit Anthony Yarde in August and, should he overcome Canelo, the 36-year-old would perhaps be easy pickings for Beterbiev.\n\nShould Canelo come through, he would likely vacate and move back down to middleweight, making that WBO title vacant and up for grabs, meaning the only logical fight would be for Bivol and Beterbiev to fight to establish a unified champion.\n\nIn any case, the purported most dangerous man in the sport could potentially come one of its most famous, having already amassed a following in just 15 fights. Whatever the future may hold for boxing, Artur Beterbiev holds an extremely bright future, albeit as a dark force, in his hammer-like hands.", "description": "Artur Beterbiev\u2019s undefeated record and chilling KO power has seen the WBC & IBF light heavyweight champion be labeled \u2018the most dangerous man in boxing\u2019, and has drawn comparisons with fellow Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db4147520302758c966447c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
