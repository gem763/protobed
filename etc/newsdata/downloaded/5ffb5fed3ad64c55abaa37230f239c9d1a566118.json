In protest, Ukraine announced on Tuesday it was withdrawing its invitation to PACE monitors to observe parliamentary elections to be held on July 21.\n\nTrudeau and Zelensky also discussed Canadian arms sales and Canada's military training mission in Ukraine.\n\nIn March, Ottawa renewed its mission of some 200 Canadian troops deployed to Ukraine until the end of March 2022.\n\nSince 2015, Canada has so far trained nearly 11 000 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nRegarding Ukrainian reforms, Trudeau said there has been \"much improvement\" in the last few years, which he believes will continue, particularly in the fight against corruption.\n\nThe Canadian leader said he is convinced that with the election of Zelensky, a former comedian who took office in May, there will be \"even more positive steps\" in Ukraine.\n\n\"We will be patient because there is a lot of work to do,\" Trudeau said.\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland also announced $45m in additional Canadian assistance to Ukraine in support of its reforms and a proposed national police force.\n\nSince 2014, Canada - the first Western country to recognise Ukraine's independence in December 1991 and home to a large Ukrainian diaspora - has provided the country more than $785m in aid.\n\nFreeland also condemned Russia's decision to issue Russian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Donbass region, a disputed area in eastern Ukraine that is a hotbed of pro-Russian separatism.\n\n\"Starting today, Canada will take action to ensure that these passports cannot be used to travel to Canada. We encourage our partners to do likewise,\" she said.\n\nThe armed conflict between Ukrainian forces and the pro-Russian separatists has claimed 13 000 lives since 2014.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau promised to support Ukraine in the wake of Russian \"aggression\", after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in Toronto.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9065/66468259d9c54cc892a1ed98c6addac2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-03"}
