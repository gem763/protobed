Other players in the crowded space include AT&T\u2019s (T) DirecTV Now, Dish Network\u2019s (DISH) Sling TV, Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, FuboTV, Philo, and Frndly TV.\n\nJust a week ago, the Information reported that Sony had hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to seek a buyer for the service, which according to that story had about 500,000 subscribers. That story had named FuboTV, a sports-oriented over-the-top service, as a potential buyer, but apparently no deal materialized.\n\nData from eMarketer earlier this year named Sling TV as the leader in the skinny-cable bundle market, with about 2.4 million subscribers, followed by Hulu + Live TV at 2 million, DirecTV Now with 1.5 million, YouTube TV with 1 million, PlayStation Vue with 800,000, and Fubo with 300,000.\n\nAs more premium subscription services launch\u2014 Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Apple TV+ goes live Nov. 1 and Walt Disney\u2019s (DIS) Disney+ starts streaming on Nov. 12\u2014it is clearer than ever that the need for access to broadcast and basic-cable channels is limited beyond news and sports. While cord-cutting continues unabated, many cord-cutters simply aren\u2019t choosing to sign up for a skinny bundle to take the place of traditional cable. And the steady price increases installed by most of the skinny-bundle providers has made them a lot less appealing to consumers than they once were.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
