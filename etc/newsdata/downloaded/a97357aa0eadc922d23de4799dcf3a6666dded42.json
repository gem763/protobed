The fairs always featured \"paper doll\" performances in which trans women (mak nyahs in Malay) would perform on stage as though they were in a beauty pageant. Shika was born into a body that was assigned as \u201cmale,\u201d but she\u2019d already begun to recognise that this didn't feel right. \u201cThey were so beautiful, I wondered if I could be like them,\u201d she said. \u201cMalaysia was a very different place back then.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the Malaysian government offered gender-confirmation surgeries\u2014the only other country in Southeast Asia to offer the surgery aside from Thailand. Trans health was so widely embraced that even the government contributed funds towards the Mak Nyah Association. But then in 1983, everything changed.\n\nThat year a fatwa was issued by the National Fatwa Council, banning such surgeries, and the hospital was shut down, marking the beginning of a repressive, anti-LGBT chapter in Malaysia\u2019s history.\n\nShika was about six years old when the fatwa was issued. As a child she was obsessed by the glamorous mak nyahs she\u2019d seen at the pageants, and she collected any newspaper or magazine clipping mentioning a trans woman. The first story she ever cut out was from a British newspaper article on Caroline Cossey, a trans actress featured in a 1981 James Bond film. \u201cWhen I read about her when I was really young, I really thought to myself \u2018that is me,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAll of the positive depictions of mak nyahs Shika found were in Western publications. Sadly, almost all portrayals of trans women in local Malaysian newspapers were either neutral or negative. Some articles even claimed that when trans women died, the earth would refuse them due to their sins. And yet, despite the terrifying portrayal of trans women in Malaysian media, Shika still held on to these articles as proof that people like her existed.\n\nShika believed the only way she could transition was if she migrated to the West. But when her father died in 2009 and she still hadn\u2019t migrated, she decided to go ahead and transition in the country where she\u2019d been born. \"When he passed away, I told myself, 'fuck I think I really need to transition\u2026 I need to really catch up with my dreams and make it happen. Life is so short',\" she said.\n\nToday, Shika is a woman and an artist and plays in a trans and queer band, Tingtongketz, in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe tolerance towards trans and queer people that Shika remembers from her childhood was not an anomalous blip in Malaysia\u2019s history. In fact, it was for many centuries the de-facto attitude not just for Malaysia, but also for most of Southeast Asia, even in Islamic countries such as Indonesia and Brunei.\n\nMadam Phung is a star in Vietnam's traveling drag queen scene. From a VICE article by Zoe Osborne\n\nThe tragedy is that Southeast Asia\u2019s rich LGBT history is unknown to most people. Modern headlines are mostly negative\u2014particularly in Brunei, where a recently passed law prescribed death-by-stoning for all who commit gay sex or adultery. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah later announced the law would likely never be enforced, but the fact that it even passed was still a shock for most Westerners. As the former New Zealand PM, Helen Clark, tweeted: \u201cHard to comprehend what could be driving such a barbaric move which stands in stark opposition to fundamental human rights principles.\u201d\n\nYet this isn\u2019t a simple case of the West looking down its nose at the East. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that European powers once mocked Southeast Asia's tolerance for gender and sexual diversity, perceiving their attitudes as evidence the region needed \u201credemptive civilization.\u201d\n\nSouth Sulawesi is a great example. When the Europeans arrived in the 16th century, they were shocked by what they saw. Portuguese missionary Antonio de Paiva wrote a scandalized letter to his Catholic bishop in 1544 about his observations of the Bugis people:\n\n\u201cYour Lordship will know that the priests of these kings are generally called bissus. They grow no hair on their beards, dress in a womanly fashion, and grow their hair long and braided; they imitate [women\u2019s] speech because they adopt all of the female gestures and inclinations. They marry and are received, according to the custom of the land, with other common men, and they live indoors, uniting carnally in their secret places with the men whom they have for husbands...\u201d\n\nHe concluded the letter with his amazement that the Christian god, who had destroyed \"three cities of Sodom for the same sin,\" had not yet destroyed such \"wanton people\" who were \"encircled by evil.\"\n\n\n\nThe bissu tradition dates back to the 13th century. They are considered a \u201cfifth gender\u201d within the Bugis' gender system, which is comprised of male men (oroan\u00e9); female women (makkunrai); male women (calabai); female men (calalai); and bissu, who are neither male nor female.\n\nThis example of gender-bending ritualism wasn\u2019t just unique to South Sulawesi, but was found throughout Southeast Asia. Such traditions were a function of age-old indigenous belief systems that portrayed the gods as androgynous, or comprised of male-female pairs. Given this view of divinity, people who embodied both masculinity and femininity in their gender and/or sexuality were believed to be closer to the divine and uniquely capable of mediating between the spirits and humans.\n\nBabaylan healers on parade in the Philippines.

As early as the 15th century, there are records of Malay androgynous priests, or sida-sida, who served in the palaces of Malay sultans. The sida-sida were typically \u201cmale-bodied priests or courtiers\u201d who undertook \u201candrogynous behavior\u201d such as wearing women\u2019s clothes and likely \u201cengaged in sexual relationships with individuals of the same sex\u201d or \u201cboth sexes.\u201d\n\nUp until the 1950s, sida-sida were observed working in palaces. Shika recalls hearing of an elderly trans woman who used to work in such a palace before she passed away. In the 19th century, trans women among the Iban\u2014an indigenous community in Borneo\u2014known as the \u201cmanang bali\u201d were well-respected for their abilities to heal and mediate between the spirits and people. They were AMAB (assigned male at birth) individuals who adopted the mannerisms, clothing, and lifestyle of women, even taking on men as husbands and often becoming village chiefs.\n\nOver in the Philippines, pre-colonial communities were religiously led by babaylan, or, women healers and shamans who were responsible for mediating between the gods and people. These roles were also open to AMAB people (asog, bayog) so long as they comported themselves like women. A 16th century Spanish manuscript records asog in the following manner:\n\n\u201cOrdinarily they dress as women, act like prudes, and are so effeminate that one does not know them would believe they are women\u2026 they marry other males and sleep with them as man and wife and have carnal knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn Vietnam, there are similar records kept by European priests of \u201cmen\u201d who acted as spirit mediums and who wore \u201cwomen\u2019s clothing and completely pull out their beards.\u201d Even today, the tradition of feminine, AMAB mediums who channel feminine spirits lives on in Dao Mau temples that worship the Mother Goddess, an indigenous religion to Vietnam.\n\nA nat kadaw (spirit medium) at a nat pw\u00e8 (spirit festival) in Myanmar. Image via Wikimedia Commons\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Myanmar (formerly Burma), which has a rich pre-Buddhist tradition of \u201cnat kadaws,\u201d translating literally to \u201cwife of a spirit.\u201d While there are historical records of AFAB (assigned female at birth) nat kadaws\u2014some of whom resisted the British in the First Anglo-Burmese War\u2014today nat kadaws are known as AMAB individuals who dress as women during the ceremonies and perform important blessings. They typically have sex with men, and some also identify as women outside of a ceremonial context.\n\nThese are just a few examples from an enormous list of Southeast Asia\u2019s gender-bending rituals. The fact that many \u201ctransgender\u201d figures in Southeast Asia hold religious roles does not necessarily mean that religious contexts were the only safe spaces for gender non-conformists. Thailand, for example, is a country without a tradition of transgender ritualism, but is nevertheless famous for its \u201cthird sex\u201d of kathoeys, who are typically AMAB people who appear and dress as women.\n\nWith many governments throughout the region imposing increasingly draconian laws against LGBTQ communities, it\u2019s more important than ever for Southeast Asians to learn about their proud queer history. Malaysian government officials have recently issued statements declaring LGBTQ rights to be a \u201cWestern idea\u201d created in an effort to re-colonise Asia, but this isn\u2019t true.\n\nAlthough Shika grew up accustomed to trans women in her early childhood, she only learned of the ritualistic tradition of the Malay sida-sida in 2009, after attending workshops hosted by LGBTQ NGOs.\n\n\u201cI feel very proud that we\u2019ve been around for so long in Malaysia,\u201d she said. \u201cGenerally people here do not know who the sida-sida are. Since the 80s, the media tries to say that trans women are something new\u2026 that LGBT is a Western thing.\u201d\n\nThis was a similar experience for Faris Saad, a trans man who plays in the \u201cqueercore\u201d music scene along with Shika. He recalls how he felt when he first learned about Malaysia\u2019s increasingly forgotten trans and queer traditions.\n\n\u201cI was like \u2018oh this shit\u2019s cool.\u2019 Then I thought \u2018fuck, we don\u2019t have it anymore.\u2019 We have lost something that could\u2019ve affected so many people\u2019s lives. A lot of people today wouldn\u2019t be dead if we kept that [tradition] alive,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many LGBTQ advocates in Malaysia, connecting their present activism to their country\u2019s queer heritage feels vital. As Saad explained: \u201cI want to help people understand that acceptance of queer people is not a Western thing. It\u2019s who we always were. We changed because we adopted another culture and tried to be somebody we are not.\u201d\n\nThis article was written with the help of Mayang Al-Mohdhar, a writer based in Malaysia.
