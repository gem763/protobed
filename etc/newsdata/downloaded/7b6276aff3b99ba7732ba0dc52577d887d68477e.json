Why the Brexit WAB is so controversial", "language": "en", "text": "London (CNN) We're in the Brexit endgame -- or so Boris Johnson hopes.\n\nBy Thursday evening, the British Prime Minister intends to have done the seemingly impossible and passed a Brexit deal.\n\nBut whether he is able to do that depends on a series of crucial votes by lawmakers on his Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB).\n\nJohnson is hoping to push the entirety of the WAB through Parliament this week, enabling him to keep to his pledge of taking Britain out of the EU before November.\n\nThe bill is required to convert the pact agreed by the UK and the EU into British law.\n\nAnd an amendment passed in Parliament on Saturday makes it more significant. Now, rather than approving the agreement via a one-off \"meaningful vote,\" the whole of the bill must be signed off before the UK can leave the EU.\n\nBut the government's efforts to force it through in three days are proving controversial, and the bill could be picked apart and reshaped by lawmakers even if it succeeds in its initial vote on Tuesday.\n\nBut since you may not want to -- it comes to 435 pages with its associated memos and notes -- here's a brief explainer of what exactly the WAB says, and why it's so significant.\n\nWhat is the WAB?\n\nJohnson's government reached a withdrawal agreement with the EU last week, setting out what Brexit will look like.\n\nThe deal looked similar to the one previously negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May, with one big difference: Johnson's pact strips out May's hated Northern Irish backstop mechanism for a customs border in the Irish sea -- something May said she would never agree to.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill required to implement it is a hefty document, covering various areas of a post-Brexit UK including provisions for EU citizens, workers' rights, the environment, and customs arrangements.\n\nThe whole thing runs to 115 pages. Then, when you're finished that, there's another five related documents -- including a 104-page memorandum, 122 pages of explanatory notes, a 69-page impact assessment, another 10-page memo, and 15 pages of opinion from the Regulatory Policy Committee.\n\nIt would take you hours to sift through the whole text, and the government only published the bill on Monday evening -- providing Westminster with plenty of bedtime reading.\n\nWhy is the timetable controversial?\n\nJohnson is desperate to stick to his promise that the UK will leave the EU on October 31, but he can only achieve that with a rapidly accelerated timetable.\n\nSo Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, unveiled a three-day schedule for debates and votes on the bill, hoping it can be done and dusted by Thursday.\n\nBut that timeframe for such a lengthy and significant bill is causing anger on the opposition backbenches.\n\n\"Issues like this need to be properly debated not rushed through. Government is storing up very serious future problems by the way it is trying to implement this,\" Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted.\n\nShe called on the government to add extra days, noting the importance and complexities of issues such as EU citizens and their legal claims to citizenship rights.\n\nSpent hrs last night reading withdrawal agreement bill. Lots in it on EU citizens rights inc appeal process. Should be area of political agreement, but #Windrush shows crucial to get detail right & have proper scrutiny w expert legal advice. Govt shd be sensible & add extra days \u2014 Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) October 22, 2019\n\nKen Clarke, a former Conservative minister turned independent whose vote could be crucial, added: \"If the Government is for some reason insistent on dashing for this completely silly and irrelevant date which it keeps staking its fate on then give some proper time for debate. Two-and-a-bit days of ordinary parliamentary hours is plainly quite insufficient.\"\n\nThe last big EU upheaval, the Lisbon Treaty, was pored over in 25 sittings over five months in London.\n\nThe 1993 Maastricht Treaty founding the European Union was also subject to months of torturous nitpicking in Westminster.\n\nSo it's optimistic for Johnson to argue that the issue of leaving the EU can be sorted in 72 hours.\n\nThe Labour Party is arguing that Johnson is running from proper parliamentary scrutiny. Its official position is to vote down both the bill and his timetable, but rebel MPs within the party could swing the votes towards Johnson.\n\nMinisters are trying to bounce MPs into signing off a Bill that could cause huge damage to our country.\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson knows that the more time people have to read the small print of his deal, the more it will be exposed for the risks it represents to our economy and communities. \u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) October 21, 2019\n\nWill Johnson get the votes?\n\nIt's looking like the Prime Minister could squeak the WAB through Parliament on Tuesday evening.\n\nA CNN analysis showed that he could win by around three to five votes, with just enough Labour rebels and independents joining his side.\n\nBut the vote on the government's timetable, which will come immediately afterwards on Tuesday, could be tighter.\n\nDiscussions will be ongoing in Westminster over the course of the day about whether to grant the government a three-day window to get all aspects of the bill through.\n\nIf it loses the timetable vote, it could have to rely on the EU granting the extension that Johnson asked for but didn't want.\n\nAlternatively, the Prime Minister could abandon the legislation altogether and seek a general election in an effort to resolve the mess.", "description": "We're in the Brexit endgame -- or so Boris Johnson hopes.
