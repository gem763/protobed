There was a lot of heaviness, but we took care of that.\n\n\"Now the house has a different vibration.\"\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nThe couple were first spotted together in June 2018, and announced their engagement in February this year.\n\nJen's ring is an emerald cut diamond on a simple thin gold band.\n\nThey threw an engagement party at the River Cafe in Brooklyn attended by fellow actress Emma Stone.\n\n(Image: SplashNews.com)\n\nGuests at the wedding were served sweet potato flat cakes, brussels sprouts with cured egg yolk, smoked pork belly with pickled apple, and salt cod beignets (like doughnuts but savoury).\n\nOnce the guests were seated, they were treated to main courses of either wood-roasted fish with herbs and lemon-infused butter, or leg of five-week-aged beef with forager's sauce.\n\nThere was also smoked new potatoes, whey-braised cabbage and roasted heirloom carrots to wow their tastebuds.\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nThe happy couple picked out their favourite desserts to serve at the reception, too.\n\nGuests were given the option of a fire-baked bread pudding with chocolate, salted caramel and fresh apple, sweet cauldron fritters with bourbon cream and cinnamon sugar, or marshmallow s'mores that they can roast themselves.\n\nThere's literally no way anyone would have been able to stand up and dance over that feast, but they might just about have found room for a glass or five of the couple's custom-designed cocktails - a bourbon Old Fashioned or gin cucumber lavender champagne.", "description": "The Oscar-winning actress married her fianc\u00e9 in a once-haunted mansion yesterday, but guests have all had their social media on lockdown", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Backgrid", "T.Jackson", "Richard Harbus", "Mega", "Elder Ordonez", "Splashnews.Com", "Josiahw", "Pa Wire Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658318.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Kris-Jenner-and-Corey-Gamble-arrive-to-Jennifer-Lawrence-and-Cooke-Maroneys-wedding.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
