REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/Illustration\n\nALMATY (Reuters) - The Kazakh tenge KZT= may strengthen against the dollar this month as monetary easing in the United States and Europe offsets concerns about the impact of slower global growth and trade wars, according to a Reuters poll.\n\nFive out of nine participants in the poll, which was carried out Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, predicted that the currency would gain this month. Two analysts saw it trading unchanged at about 389 per dollar, and two said it would slip.\n\nThe 12-month outlook was bearish, with all nine analysts forecasting a weaker tenge.
