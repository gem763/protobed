Republicans have been calling on House Democrats to hold a floor vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry so that Republicans can be given subpoena power, but Pelosi has decided against such a vote. Trump administration officials also have called for a House vote authorizing the inquiry, calling it invalid without one and refusing to cooperate.\n\nPelosi said in her letter Monday that Democrats \"will bring a resolution to the Floor that affirms the ongoing, existing investigation that is currently being conducted by our committees as part of this impeachment inquiry, including all requests for documents, subpoenas for records and testimony, and any other investigative steps previously taken or to be taken as part of this investigation.\"\n\nThe House Rules Committee on Monday announced that its members will meet Wednesday afternoon, in advance of the Thursday vote, to consider the resolution. A description of the proposal on the committee's website said the measure would direct \"certain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America.\"\n\nSo far, nine witnesses have provided more than 70 hours of closed-door testimony, according to a tally by NBC News.\n\nThe Democrats' move comes after former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman refused to appear for a scheduled deposition Monday morning before the three House congressional committees leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe White House had been trying to block his appearance, and Kupperman, who worked under former national security adviser John Bolton,filed a lawsuit Fridayasking a federal judge to rule on whether he must testify under a congressional subpoena.", "description": "This comes as pressure grows on Democrats to conduct the inquiry with a more open process, including holding public hearings with key witnesses in the Ukraine case.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4265572/1000x563_nbc-191017-nancy-pelosi-cs-1054a_880ae73791804575889897c7d0d09aef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
