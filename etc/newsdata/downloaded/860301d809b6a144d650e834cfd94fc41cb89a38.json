He had lapses in his faith. He returned to it. He fell again. He got on his feet again. He fell again. But I think it was really the intervention of [his wife] June Carter Cash that probably saved his life, and it was her strong faith in God, and... that God came through this time of addiction that he struggled with.\n\n\u2018SUMMER OF \u201842\u2019 STAR SPEAKS ON SUICIDE TRY, GUNSHOT WOUND AND FAMILY ABUSE\n\n\u201cThe reason that Johnny has not joined the pantheon of rock stars who died of drug overdoses or alcohol abuse is because he knew where to turn when he was in trouble, and he turned to the Lord,\" continued Laurie. \"Sinners thought he was a saint. Saints thought he was a sinner. The reality is, he was both.\u201d\n\nAccording to Laurie\u2019s book, Cash was born in a dirt-poor, God-fearing household in rural Arkansas during the Great Depression. While serving in the Air Force in the early \u201850s, he met 17-year-old Vivian Liberto and the couple married four years later when he left the service. Cash later became a door-to-door appliance salesman but he was determined to pursue music.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Cash met guitar-playing auto-mechanics Monroe Perkins and Marshall Grant through his brother Ray, who worked in a garage. They formed a band and performed in church socials and county fairs. In 1954, the group auditioned for record producer Sam Phillips of Sun Records. Cash was signed to a contract by Sun and quickly began touring across the country while Liberto was left alone to raise their four daughters.\n\nIRON MAIDEN'S BRUCE DICKINSON RECALLS MEETING JOHNNY CASH, FIGHTING CANCER IN NEW MEMOIR\n\nIt was during the \u201850s when Cash was introduced to amphetamines to fight off-road fatigue \u2014 and he became hooked. Cash was allegedly taking up to a 100 pills that he washed down with beer and made frequent trips to Mexico where he could pick up more amphetamines without a prescription. Cash was famously arrested in El Paso, Texas in 1965 for smuggling amphetamines from Mexico. News reports at the time claimed Cash was found with 668 Dexedrine and 475 Equanol tablets in his luggage.\n\n\u201cIt started with amphetamines,\u201d Laurie explained. \u201cWhen he was going on the road, and just trying to stay awake to do his gigs, he had a vulnerability to alcohol, a vulnerability to drugs of all kinds.\u201d\n\nLaurie claimed Cash\u2019s addictions intensified over the years after he endured several shocking incidents.\n\nSUSAN OLSEN TALKS 'A VERY BRADY BUNCH RENOVATION,' SAYS VOTING FOR TRUMP GOT HER IN TROUBLE ON RADIO SHOW\n\n\u201cHe had an ostrich name Waldo that attacked him [in 1981] and almost killed him,\u201d said Laurie. \u201cIn fact, it jumped on top of Johnny Cash, broke four of his ribs, ripped him wide. And if he wasn\u2019t wearing the\u2026 giant metal belt buckle, he may not have lived to tell the story of Waldo\u2026 Even a dentist broke his jaw later in life, causing him to go on pain meds. So whenever meds were involved, he would have an issue with addiction. It was a struggle for Johnny throughout his life, but he was able to get free of all those things towards the end of his life.\u201d\n\nJOHNNY CASH'S FORMER MANAGER TACKLED SINGER'S DRUG BATTLES BUT QUIT OVER RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, BOOK CLAIMS\n\nCash himself recalled the shocking encounter in his 2003 book \"Cash: The Autobiography.\"\n\n\u201cAll he did was break my two lower ribs and rip my stomach open down to my belt,\u201d he wrote. \"If the belt hadn\u2019t been good and strong, with a sold belt buckle, he\u2019d have spilled my guts exactly the way he meant to. As it was, he knocked me over onto my back and I broke three my ribs on a rock \u2014 but I had sense enough to keep swinging\u2026 so he didn\u2019t get to finish me. I scored a good hit on one of his legs, and he ran off.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Soon I was going around to different doctors to keep those pills coming in the kind of quantities I needed, and when they started upsetting my digestive system, I started drinking wine to settle my stomach, which worked reasonably well,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe wine also took the sharper, more uncomfortable edges off the amphetamines I\u2019d begun adding to the mix because \u2014 well because I was still looking for that euphoria.\u201d\n\nWANDA JACKSON DETAILS HER RELATIONSHIP WITH ELVIS PRESLEY, BECOMING A COUNTRY MUSIC SEX SYMBOL\n\nIn 1956, Cash made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry and met singer June Carter, the wife of fellow artist Carl Smith, backstage. According to Laurie\u2019s account, Cash reportedly told Carter he would marry her one day. Later that year, Smith and Carter called it quits and eventually joined Cash on the road.\n\nThe New York Times shared that after a near-fatal drug binge in 1967, Carter persuaded Cash to seek treatment for his drug dependency and rediscover his Christian faith. Cash and Liberto divorced in 1968 and that same year, he married Carter.\n\nRADIO HOST DELILAH SAYS FAITH \u2018SAVED MY SANITY\u2019 AFTER SHE LOST TWO SONS: \u2018I DID THE BEST THAT I COULD\u2019\n\n\u201cJohnny would be the first to admit that he failed in his first marriage to Vivian,\u201d said Laurie. \u201cHe was not a good husband or a good father. He was on the road a lot. He had a lot of issues back then, and that ended in divorce. And then June Carter came into his life, and she became his beloved wife, and probably saved his life because of her firm faith in Christ, and her unwillingness to let Johnny completely destroy himself. Johnny had to ultimately go to rehab to get his life cleaned up, which he did.\u201d\n\nIt was also the wake-up call Johnny needed to get his life together.\n\n\u201cWhen Johnny made the recommitment to Christ, he\u2019d become very famous, and it was hard for him to go to church because when he would show up, everyone would just stop and stare at him,\u201d explained Laurie. \u201cAnd when people found out he was going to church, aspiring songwriters would come to him, hoping he would take demos to record executives. And so Johnny was very sporadic in his church attendance. But there\u2019s one man name Jimmie Snow, a minister, who reached out to Johnny and really challenged him to start coming to church, which Johnny did.\u201d\n\nSHA NA NA\u2019S JOCKO MARCELLINO RECALLS OPENING FOR JIMI HENDRIX AT WOODSTOCK: \u2018WE BATHED IN THE POND\u2019\n\n\u201cJohnny came under what we would call the conviction of the Holy Spirit over Sunday, which simply means that he realized he needed to really get right with God,\u201d Laurie continued. \u201cAnd he went forward [with] the invitation of the pastor. He got down on his knees with his family, and he prayed, and he asked God to forgive him of his sins. That recommitment was something that carried Johnny right through to the end of his life.\u201d\n\nAccording to Laurie, Cash became a licensed minister and even seriously considered leaving music altogether to become a preacher.\n\n\u201cIt was actually his wife June who said, \u2018Oh no, Johnny. You have a much larger platform with your music,\u2019\u201d said Laurie. \u201cAnd so even when he was at the peak of his fame, Johnny always used his platform to talk about Jesus. He was never embarrassed to be a Christian, never ashamed of his faith in any way\u2026 He never lost his faith. He just lost his way, and then he found his way back to the Lord again.\u201d\n\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE ON HER CHRISTIAN FAITH: \u2018THE BIBLE MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME\u2019\n\nBut Cash\u2019s drug problems weren\u2019t completely over \u2014 in fact, Laurie\u2019s book revealed he entered the Betty Ford Center for treatment in 1983. Cash was reportedly treated again after he was released.\n\nDEBBIE REYNOLDS 'NEVER REALLY STOPPED LOVING' ELIZABETH TAYLOR DESPITE SHOCKING LOVE TRIANGLE, SAYS TODD FISHER\n\nIt was at the Betty Ford Center where Cash met Elizabeth Taylor and the two became friends after learning they were born a day apart. The pair would go on to exchange birthday cards for years to come.\n\nCash\u2019s career dwindled in the \u201880s, but he enjoyed a comeback in the \u201890s. As for his marriage, Cash and Carter remained together until her death in 2003 at age 73. Cash died a mere four months later.\n\nLaurie hopes that his book will shed new insight into the man behind the myth and how he relied on faith to help him overcome his demons.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story of a man who\u2019s struggled, a man who stumbled, a man who fell, but a man who acknowledged it,\u201d said Laurie. \u201cJohnny was an honest man. He was an authentic man\u2026 But what I want people to take away from reading this book is no matter how badly you\u2019ve messed up in life, God gives second chances. And no matter how many mistakes you\u2019ve made, you can get up and start over again. Johnny Cash did that. And if Johnny could do it, anyone can do it.\u201d", "description": "Johnny Cash suffered a lingering battle against addiction to drugs throughout his life, but the Man in Black desperately tried to find his way into the light.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/28/694940094001_6078633506001_6078639372001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-28"}
