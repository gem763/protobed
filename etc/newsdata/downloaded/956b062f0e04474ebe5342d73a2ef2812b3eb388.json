There is, obviously, fault on both sides. While we have been busy destroying large swathes of sea-dweller habitat, the sea-dwellers have occasionally forced beaches to close, which is roughly morally equivalent. But it appears that the denizens of the sea have made a crippling blow in the war, striking humanity where it hurts most: Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nHarris underwent surgery today due to an injury he sustained after he \u201ctripped and hand planted onto a sea urchin almost two months ago while climbing rocky cliffs in Croatia.\u201d Sure, we\u2019ve all been there. On Instagram, Harris said that he managed to pull most of the \u201ctiny spines\u201d out all by himself, but two managed to remain within the warm confines of his hand, one of which later became infected.\n\nAfter having a sea urchin spine extracted from one of his tendons (fun!), Harris is now stuck having to wear a contraption that keeps his hand elevated in this very natural pose:\n\nHopefully this won\u2019t have an impact on Harris\u2019 role in the upcoming fourth Matrix movie, which, believe it or not, he has been cast in \u2014 alongside Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss.", "description": "Neil Patrick Harris is recovering after receiving surgery for an injury he sustained when he tripped and fell on a sea urchin in Croatia.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/nphurchin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
