Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) listens during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)\n\nDaniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything\n\nBack in the Before Time of 2016, I occasionally praised Sen. Marco Rubio for his foreign policy acumen. Unlike many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Rubio seemed genuinely interested in the topic. During a time when the GOP seemed to be dumbing itself down on foreign policy, Rubio sounded relatively knowledgeable. Sure, he was a hawk, but at least he was an informed hawk.\n\nThe Trump years have not been kind to Rubio\u2019s reputation in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, one of those ways is that Rubio now sounds about as simple-minded on foreign policy as, you know, the president of the United States.\n\nConsider Rubio\u2019s approach to China. As previously noted in this space, the #OMGChina crowd has become ever louder inside the Beltway, and Rubio has become a loud part of that caucus. It is good that Rubio cares about, say, the Hong Kong protesters. It is not so good when Rubio lacks any useful ideas about how to counter Chinese influence.\n\nThis brings us to the case of the Solomon Islands, a South Pacific island chain east of Australia with a population of less than a million people. Because the Solomon Islands is recognized as a sovereign country, it has membership in a variety of international organizations, including the United Nations. More significant, the Solomon Islands had recognized Taiwan rather than the People\u2019s Republic of China since 1983. It is one of several small island nations that Beijing and Taipei have battled over to secure diplomatic recognition.\n\nIn March, an issue in the Solomon Islands election was whether to switch its diplomatic recognition to Beijing. According to Reuters\u2019s Charlotte Greenfield and Tom Westbrook, two-thirds of the Solomons\u2019 exports go to the People\u2019s Republic, which suggests an obvious logic of recognizing Beijing. Furthermore, they reported that Taiwan\u2019s foreign aid was a bit problematic: \u201cTaiwan\u2019s support of around $9 million a year is paid directly into a government account which lawmakers tap for projects in their far-flung provinces, with little oversight. \u2018In the rural areas there is no tangible development,\u2019 said Andrew Fanasia, politics reporter at the Solomon Star newspaper.\u201d This has been an ongoing perception problem in Taiwan\u2019s influence strategy.\n\nThis month, a task force commissioned by the new government recommended the Solomon Islands switch its recognition. The government followed the report\u2019s recommendation and did so, leaving only 16 countries that recognize Taiwan.\n\nAnd now let\u2019s let Sen. Rubio reenter the conversation:\n\nAnd now I will begin exploring ways to cut off ties with #SolomonIslands including potentially ending financial assistance & restricting access to U.S. dollars & banking. https://t.co/1l7YdmhWNK \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) September 16, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know where to begin with this idiocy, but let\u2019s start with the rather obvious point that in making this switch, the Solomon Islands was shifting its foreign policy closer to that of the United States. It might have escaped Rubio\u2019s attention, but Washington also recognizes Beijing and not Taipei. As Daniel Larison notes in The American Conservative: \u201cit is utter hypocrisy for an American politician to berate another government for doing what our government did forty years ago.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, this has not stopped the Trump administration from acting annoyed about other countries switching their recognition from Taiwan to the People\u2019s Republic. And from a U.S. perspective, there is some value in Taiwan not being completely isolated diplomatically.\n\nStill, imposing sanctions on the Solomons would be an overreaction, and very likely counterproductive. Ordinarily, a small country like the Solomons would acquiesce to such pressure. Beijing, however, could act like a \u201cblack knight\u201d and compensate the Solomons for any economic suffering U.S. sanctions would cause. The overall effect would push the Solomons even deeper into China\u2019s orbit, much like Cuba became closer to the U.S.S.R. after the United States sanctioned Fidel Castro. Given its strategic location, this would be the outcome that the United States should avoid. It is also a much more plausible outcome if Rubio gets his sanctions.\n\nThis will probably not go anywhere because even the Trump administration has not actually imposed sanctions on other countries that have made this diplomatic switch. This is probably a case of Rubio puffing out his chest and talking tough. Still, I wish that the senator \u2014 and President Trump, for that matter \u2014 would not react to everything he dislikes in the world with a threat to sanction. Perhaps better preemptive diplomacy \u2014 statecraft that would add some carrots to the Trump administration\u2019s stick-only diet \u2014 could be an area where Rubio should concentrate his efforts. Because his efforts to bully small island nations are worthless and weak.", "description": "Can the U.S. go one day without sanctioning a new country?", "authors": ["Daniel W. Drezner", "Daniel W.
