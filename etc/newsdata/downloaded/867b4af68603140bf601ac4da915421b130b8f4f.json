With Xiaomi\u2019s major focus on providing a long battery life, good camera specs and ample firepower at a decent price, the series has been an eminent factor in the company\u2019s success in the country. And now, the series has something new to boast of - the all new Redmi Redmi Note 8 and the Note 8 Pro.\n\nHaving launched both the smartphones today alongside the MIUI 11, Xiaomi reiterated its agenda for the series. To start with, the Redmi Note 8 Pro comes as \u201cthe world\u2019s first 64MP camera sensor\u201d, \u201cIndia's first smartphone to launch with Amazon Alexa built-in\u201d as well as \u201cthe world's first smartphone with Dual Wake (i.e. both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa support),\u201d all as claimed by the company. Now those are a lot of tags to handle at once for sure!\n\nThe Redmi Note 8 is no less. Though it does not have as much \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d titles to show off, it does offer a lot in its price range, i.e. Rs 9,999 for the 4GB+64GB variant and Rs 12,999 for 6GB+128GB one. Meanwhile, the Note 8 Pro comes for Rs 14,999, Rs 15,999 and Rs 17,999 for the 6GB+64GB, 6GB+128GB and the 8GB+128GB variants. Here is a quick look at the specifications of the two devices.\n\nRedmi Note 8 Specifications\n\nDon't Miss 39.1 K SHARES 15.1 K SHARES 27.5 K SHARES 11.1 K SHARES 4.6 K SHARES\n\nWe have been using the Redmi Note series smartphones since the advent of the Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro. Though that gives me a fair taste of what Xiaomi has on cards, we would say there is some excitement for the latest versions. Having checked them out for a while at the launch event, here is what we liked about the smartphones and what I did not!\n\nWhat we love!\n\nThe Moonlight White On The Note 8\n\nWe have come across elegant and nifty devices over the years. But not many match up to what the Redmi Note 8 looks like in its Moonlight White colour. The smartphone, though a budget one, oozes volumes of grace in that colour tone.\n\nTo perk it up, Xiaomi has used a nano-coating at the back to refract light at different angles. That means you get to see a good variation of the colours at the back under direct light. Fancy stuff!\n\nThe Performance Pursuit On The Note 8 Pro\n\nThe world of smartphones is now embracing smartphone gaming like never before. Pick any of the recent launches and you can easily notice the pattern. Xiaomi did not bow out of the race either. At the Note 8 Pro\u2019s launch, it spun the whole performance mettle of the device around gaming. And honestly, it was quite impressive!\n\nThe Note 8 Pro marks the entry of MediaTek Helio G90T processor in India. Now put all the trust you want on a Qualcomm processor (which powers the Redmi Note 8 by the way), a MediaTek SoC has its perks and some test results were shared by Xiaomi for the same. Have a look at them in the image above.\n\nOhh, and did we say it has liquid cooling too?\n\nLong Battery Life\n\nThe Redmi Note 8 Pro comes with a 4500 mAh battery, while the Note 8 is powered by a 4000 mAh one. Now to be honest, the long battery life is not something exclusive to the two Redmi Note smartphones in their price ranges. That being said, we cannot avoid the fact that it IS there and it is just as desirable!\n\n18W Charger in-the-box\n\nOne way Xiaomi has complemented the long battery life of smartphones is by enabling fast charging on them through a USB type-C port. This fast charging will be supported by an 18W fast charger, which is being offered inside the box.\n\nThe Quad Cameras\n\nBoth the Redmi Note devices come with a quad camera setup. While this extends to a 64 MP primary lens in the Note 8 Pro, even the Note 8 promises a 48 MP one. With that, there is a telephoto, a wide-angle as well as a depth lens for an all-rounded photography experience.\n\nWe checked out the cameras of both the devices and we can safely say that they looked promising at first glance. The colours were right, the focus was on point and the highlights were good too. More on these soon!\n\nBuilt-in Alexa\n\nThis is something new and just as exciting. From what we could figure in the demonstration videos, the in-built Alexa support lets you commandeer everything connected to your Alexa devices right from your phone, including your Mi TV. So all those having Alexa devices at home might want to give it a shot!\n\nXiaomi\u2019s Market Study\n\n5 years on and the Chinese tech giant still doesn\u2019t seem to amaze. A particular feature in the new Xiaomi smartphones reiterates that. Now it is one thing to bring in a feature in your devices and an entirely different one to offer the feature in a single country. The Indian versions of the Redmi Note 8 and the Note 8 Pro are the only ones with a dual SIM + microSD support. Talk about market intelligence!\n\nSpeakers On The Redmi Note 8\n\nXiaomi has surprisingly focussed on the audio output of both the devices. It has increased the size of the earpiece for more audio during the calls. In addition, it has improved the loudness, sound quality as well as the bass volume on the Note 8.\n\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all! Get this, Xiaomi has patented a 800 hz low frequency sound (yes, a sound) that gushes air out of the speakers. This, to clean the speakers of any dust and debris present!\n\nWhat we dislike\n\nSame Old Tune\n\nNow we understand the world\u2019s first claims and there is no doubt on their authenticity. The problem with these is, so what? Quad cameras - we have seen before, huge batteries - done that, reflecting glass panel at the back - age old.\n\nWhile both the Redmi Note 8 and the Note 8 Pro are genuinely capable smartphones, they somehow lack to instill that curiosity when it comes to using one. Now I might be asking for too much in a shoestring budget, but hey, what\u2019s wrong with making wishes, right?\n\nThe in-built Alexa support is a new feature and is certainly an exception to this. Then again, we always had Google Assistant or Apple Siri for most of the other stuff.\n\nMIUI\n\nLet me testify here first that we have not used the latest MIUI 11 at length as of now. Having said that, we have had extensive experience with the same and we daresay it is not a very desirable one. The UI comes with unnecessary pre-installed apps which display even more unnecessary push-ads. Correspondingly, the number of updates and upgrades is also high, with some update or the other almost always on the download.\n\nNow that you have a fair idea of what and what not to expect from the new Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 and the Note 8 Pro, are you interested in having one of these for yourself, or not?
