She was 75.\n\nABC broke into network programming to announce her death and pay tribute.\n\nRoberts was the daughter of Hale Boggs, a former House majority leader from Louisiana, and Lindy Boggs, who succeeded her husband in the job. Roberts worked in radio and at CBS News and PBS before joining ABC News in 1988.\n\nShe was a congressional reporter and analyst who co-anchored the Sunday political show \u201cThis Week\u201d with Sam Donaldson from 1996 to 2002.\n\nRoberts, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, kept working nearly to the end. She appeared on \u201cThis Week\u201d in August, drawing enough concern about her evident weight loss that she released a statement saying \u201cI am doing fine\u201d and was looking forward to covering next year\u2019s election.\n\nShe co-wrote a political column for many years with her husband of 53 years, Steven, who survives. They had two children.\n\nRoberts wrote books, focusing on the role of women in history. She wrote two with her husband, one about interfaith families and \u201cFrom This Day Forward,\u201d an account of their marriage.\n\nCurrent ABC News political reporter Jonathan Karl recalled being in awe of Roberts when he first started working at the network.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of politics, I think of Cokie Roberts,\u201d he said.\n\nHer colleagues said she never became cynical or lost her love for politics. She did force NPR to clarify her role as a commentator when she wrote a column in 2016 calling on \u201cthe rational wing\u201d of the Republican Party to reject Donald Trump as their presidential candidate.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cokie Roberts, the daughter of politicians who grew up to cover the family business in Washington for ABC News and NPR over several decades, died Tuesday in Washington of complications from breast cancer.
