The breakeven on that investment is seen at a $24 billion valuation.\n\nLast month, WeWork shelved plans for its initial public offering as its market value was seen at around $10 billion to $12 billion \u2013 well below the $47 billion valuation that SoftBank last invested. More recently, WeWork\u2019s valuation has been seen at about $7 billion.\n\nWeWork isn\u2019t the only Vision Fund investment that has struggled.\n\nSoftBank is facing a potential $4 billion writedown on its investment in Uber. Since going public at a valuation of around $82 billion in May, Uber shares have lost almost 25 percent of their value. Analysts were initially expecting the IPO to fetch a valuation of up to $120 billion. The Vision Fund in 2017 took a 13 percent stake in the ride-hailing company at a price tag of $7 billion.\n\nThe jury is still out on Softbank\u2019s $19 billion Sprint investment, the fate of which hinges on the outcome of a potential deal with T-Mobile. Sprint and T-Mobile in April 2018 announced a $26.5 billion deal, but its closing has been held up due to antitrust concerns. SoftBank will be on the hook for Sprint\u2019s $39 billion debt load if the deal falls apart.\n\nNot all of SoftBank\u2019s investments have been a disaster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe company made the best tech investment on record when, in 2000, it invested $20 million in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.
