Cary Poarch (right), a former employee, secretly filmed staffers at the network\n\nPatrick Davis, Manager of Field Operations, was secretly filmed complaining that the network 'wasn't what it used to be' and said it was now 'so left leaning' but failed to admit it\n\n'We're so busy trying to get appointment viewership. Even though we're totally left-leaning, we don't want to admit it.\n\n'We could be so much better than what we are.\n\n'You learn it in journalism school, we're supposed to be middle of the road that's our job. Now, it's all just infotainment is all it's become.\n\n'There is no true media news outlet,' he said.\n\nDavis added that he was 'not happy' with what the company does.\n\n'I've been here for a little while. I hate seeing what we were and what we could be and what we've become. It's just awful.\n\n'Even though we're totally left-leaning, we don't want to admit it,' he said.\n\nHe added that he had not listened to Zucker's daily 9am rundown call 'for 15 years' because it was 'bulls**t.'\n\nMike Brevna, a floor manager, said: 'It's like the Trump network, they don't think about anything else.'\n\nScott Garber, a senior field engineer :'We used to cover news. We used to go out and do stories.'\n\nGerald Sisnette, a field production supervisor, said he saw no end in sight of the current agenda.\n\nField production superviser Gerald Sisnette was filmed recording saying the obsessive coverage would only stop when Trump dies\n\nOthers who were filmed include Nick Neville, a media coorindator at the network\n\n'This is a story that's not gonna go away. Trump in general. The only way it's going to go away is when he dies. Hopefully soon,' he said.\n\nOne of Zucker's 9am rundown calls was also played.\n\nIn it, he and producers discuss a claim that President Trump wanted to put alligators and a moat along the border, an allegation that he has since denied.\n\nHe was also said to have suggested that ICE agents should 'shoot migrants in the legs' to slow them down.\n\nZucker said: 'I know there's 7,000 impeachment stories and I'm the one that's saying we should just stay on impeachment but when you know a story of this magnitude comes and you can objectively say, you're out of your mind. You should do it and say it you're out of your mind.'\n\nPoarch, in other videos, said he wanted CNN to return to 'reporting the news'.\n\nHe said it was his dream to work for the network and that he was a registered Democrat.\n\nThe network has not commented on the footage he took or the information he has shared.", "description": "Cary Poarch gave an interview to Project Veritas along with secretly recorded video tapes from inside CNN's Washington bureau which he says proves his claim that the company.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/20/19853246-0-image-a-21_1571339106732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
