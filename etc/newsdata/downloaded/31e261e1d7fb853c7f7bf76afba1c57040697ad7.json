A trio of scientists were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry for their contributions to the development of the batteries earlier this month.\n\nShould I buy an electric car?

After driving 200-300 miles per charge, one can pick up another 200-300 miles by charging for 10 minutes,\u201d Dr Chao-Yang Wang, a professor at the Pennsylvania State University and co-author of the study, told the Guardian.\n\nRapid charging in a matter of minutes requires a high current. However, at low temperatures \u2013 even at 30C (86F) \u2013 such charging of lithium ion batteries can cause problems as metallic lithium forms in spikes around the anode. Higher temperatures of about 60C (140F) would allow the lithium ions to move fast enough to avoid this problem \u2013 but keeping a battery hot can also result in problems.\n\n\u201cAt high temperatures battery active materials will react with the electrolyte to form passive surface films, consuming active lithium as well as causing high resistance,\u201d said Wang.\n\nThe formation of such films take time, he said. As a result, the team came up with the idea of keeping the battery at 60C for just long enough to charge it up.\n\nTo do so, the team developed a battery that uses thin nickel foil to create an internal self-heating structure. By heating the battery to 60C, then cooling it to room temperature, they were able to charge the battery to 80% in 10 minutes but avoid damaging it, even when repeatedly charged in this way. A Tesla Model S currently takes 40 minutes to charge from a flat battery to 80% using a supercharger.\n\nWhile the team used single cells of smaller capacity, about 10 amp hours, in their study, they say the technology could be applied to develop a battery for an electric car.\n\n\u201cWe can charge batteries of different sizes with the same [charging] time as long as the charge current increases proportionally with the battery size,\u201d said Wang. \u201cFor car battery of 150 amp hours, a fast charge station would have to provide a 900 amp current for 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nThat, he said, was already feasible with existing fast chargers.\n\nThe future, Wang said, looks bright. \u201cOur technology is simple but elegant \u2026 I guess that it will take two to three years of in-vehicle testing and evaluation before it is used in commercial vehicles.\u201d\n\nProf Clare Grey from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research. \u201cThe interesting point is that it suggests that the positive effects of heating \u2013 reduced lithium plating \u2013 outweigh the considerable degradation processes that kick in at higher temperatures,\u201d she said. But, Grey added, there is a long way to go, saying that the approach now needs to be scaled up to larger battery packs while there could be other degradation mechanisms that need to be considered. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s important to challenge conventional wisdom and come up with innovative approaches.\u201d", "description": "Scientists are developing rapid-charging batteries that could be in use in a couple of years", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/546d5be820e46e51d1ab7c00cdd521830f16328d/0_0_4352_2611/master/4352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aba3c7b2250788aaec7e77ce780b6871", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
