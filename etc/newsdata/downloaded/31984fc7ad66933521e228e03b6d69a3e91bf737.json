I am on record talking about the Durban Solid Waste (DSW) tender [for which she was charged]; I said I need the report on the DSW tender and asked why the CFO [chief financial officer Krish Kumar] kept on saying people weren\u2019t doing their work and why the city manager [Sipho Nzuza] was not ensuring supervision,\u201d she said.\n\nGumede said she was \u201con record\u201d asking who had employed Umkhonto weSizwe military veterans without following the \u201cproper channels\u201d.\n\nThe employment of 80 military veterans and their subsequent irregular pay hike angered regular workers and resulted in a violent strike that shut down the city centre for days.\n\n\u201cBecause I asked these things, as a woman leader, I was cut down,\u201d said Gumede.\n\nREAD: Zandile Gumede: The mayor they call gangster\n\n\u201cThis thing is about women leaders, as women we don\u2019t stand up and be strong ... women leaders in society, if we are not joining hands ...\u201d\n\nOne of Gumede\u2019s ardent supporters and spokesperson for her camp, Mzo Dube, said the arrest, raids and Friday\u2019s court appearance were all part of \u201ca ploy to keep mama [Gumede] away from contesting the eThekwini conference\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is unwarranted and it\u2019s unfortunate, having to attend court for her bail conditions. It was not necessary; there was absolutely no need for it. It was just to demonstrate power ...\u201d said Dube.\n\nThe conference is due to take place in December but might be postponed because of serious glitches with the party\u2019s new digital membership system.\n\nGumede has insisted that she will stand despite her ongoing trial and it seems her appearance at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Friday played into the hands of her supporters\u2019 conspiracy theories.\n\nLast week her backers accused the state of waging a \u201cruthless\u201d pursuit of an \u201cinnocent and principled\u201d woman.\n\nIn the interview Gumede said she was \u201cjust complying\u201d with the authorities to \u201cclear my name\u201d.\n\nShe said she would not being swayed from standing for the chairperson position.\n\n\u201cI am still confused as to why they are doing this to me. I enjoy support for coming back as chairperson of the region, no one can deny that, because the branches are saying so.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to comment on that because it\u2019s a political issue and I don\u2019t want to cloud the government and political issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThe raids\n\nForty-four respondents were targeted in the search and seizure operation \u2013 the accused, their family members, companies and trusts.\n\nThe seizure list includes 19 properties, some of them luxury homes and company offices, 26 high-end vehicles, including a Lamborghini Huracan Spyder 610-4, 47 more vehicles comprising work bakkies, trailers, construction vehicles and smaller cars, three taxis, 31 bank accounts, 28 share stakes in companies or trusts, two bail receipts and one caravan.\n\nREAD: Zandile Gumede may have violated her bail conditions in fraud case: Hawks\n\nContrary to social media reports, sports vehicles were not found at or seized from Gumede\u2019s family home in Inanda.\n\nAccording to the seizure list, which City Press has seen, Gumede\u2019s erf in Phoenix was attached, as was a Toyota Land Cruiser, Toyota Hilux and her 33.3% membership in MMZ Media Distributors and Supplies.\n\nI want specifics\n\nGumede claimed that in all the time since her arrest \u201cno charges\u201d had been given to her.\n\nIt is my right to know exactly [what I am being charged with], you cannot generalise, it must be on record.\n\nA charge sheet has, in fact, been filed with the commercial crimes court and was available at Gumede\u2019s first appearance, which City Press told her. The charges have been extensively reported in the media.\n\n\n\nBut she said she wanted \u201cspecifics\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just written fraud, corruption and money laundering,\u201d said Gumede.\n\n\u201cI need all the details to be given; they said in court they are still investigating, they are not saying I have done it.\n\n\u201cIt is my right to know exactly [what I am being charged with], you cannot generalise, it must be on record,\u201d she said.\n\nGumede had expected to be given a copy of the details of the charges, she said, so that she could \u201cprepare\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey need to investigate first and finish up their investigation, then they can convict,\u201d she said. It also made no sense that her belongings were attached while she didn\u2019t know the specifics of the charges, she said.\n\n\u201cI am patiently waiting for the law to tell me what I have done wrong.\u201d\n\nGumede would not be drawn on whether she would appeal the confiscation of her assets. \u201cI am complying for now.\u201d\n\nBrigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, the Hawks\u2019 spokesperson, told City Press it was not the first time they had been accused of political interference in a high-profile case, as Gumede\u2019s supporters have alleged.\n\n\u201cWe deal with criminal investigations, not politics. Politicians must go and deal with politics. Leave us to do our work. Conspiracy theories won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nANC provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said via SMS: \u201cI doubt there is much to be said by the ANC on the developments.\u201d\n\nGumede said it was not the ANC, but individuals, who had let her down.\n\n\u201cThe ANC is not a human being, I still have confidence in the ANC, it\u2019s here to stay, individuals come and go.\u201d\n\nKwaZulu-Natal-based political analyst Xolani Dube (not related to Mzo) said Gumede\u2019s standing in the ANC needed to be interpreted through the governing party\u2019s \u201cdistorted\u201d reasoning.\n\nDube said that if the ANC based its logic on moral and ethical leadership, Gumede would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d be allowed to stand for chairperson of the eThekwini region.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nDo you think former mayor Zandile Gumede should be allowed to stand for chairperson in eThekwini?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword GUMEDE and tell us what you think.
