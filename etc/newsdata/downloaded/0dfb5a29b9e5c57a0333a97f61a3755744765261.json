REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe results for July through September represented a rebound from the previous quarter when Netflix lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas. Shares of Netflix rose 9.2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday to $312.69 (243.7 pounds).\n\nThat performance, combined with concerns about new competitors, had weighed on Netflix shares, which had fallen 21% from the last earnings report through regular trading on Wednesday.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix was boosted by new seasons of shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d The company added 6.77 million paid customers around the globe, topping the nearly 6.7 million average expectation of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\n\u201cNetflix results were good enough that they assuaged concerns about price sensitivity and penetration levels in the domestic markets,\u201d said Fitch director Patrice Cucinello. \u201cA caveat is that competition hasn\u2019t hit yet.\u201d\n\nThe company projected it would pick up 7.6 million customers in the last three months of the year. Analysts had expected a forecast of 9.4 million. The company will release a new installment of \u201cThe Crown\u201d and Martin Scorsese film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d during that time.\n\nBut it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) that will be stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney\u2019s popular Marvel, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d animation and other properties.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc\u2019s (T.N) HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), are expected to enter the market next year.\n\nNetflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.\n\nNetflix acknowledge, however, that it was still taking a hit from price increases that took effect earlier this year in the United States. \u201cRetention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,\u201d it said.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix\u2019s net income rose to $665 million, or $1.47 per share, from $403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nTotal revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion.\n\nIn the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions - Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said.", "description": "Netflix Inc added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter, a relief to investors who had worried the company might fall short just as Disney and others prepare to ramp up the streaming video wars.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441619414&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1V7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
