In fact, the memorandum \u2014 a partial transcript compiled from the notes of aides \u2014 strongly suggests otherwise. Mr. Trump first makes a request for a political investigation in direct answer to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s statement that Ukraine wants to buy more U.S. antitank missiles. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though,\u201d Mr. Trump says, \u201cbecause our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d\n\nKaren Tumulty: Impeachment will define the 2020 election\n\nAn even more explicit exchange comes when discussion turns to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s top priority at the time, which was obtaining a firm commitment to a meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House. The Ukrainian leader felt he needed a Washington visit to show his country and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin that he would continue to have U.S. support against Russian aggression, but Mr. Trump had been stalling in granting a date. Toward the end of the call, Mr. Zelensky raises the subject of a visit, then reiterates that \u201cI also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, who knew very well what Mr. Zelensky wanted, responds: \u201cGood. . . . I will tell Rudy [Giuliani] and Attorney General [William P.] Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.\u201d The implicit trade-off could hardly have been more clear.\n\nMr. Zelensky never got that Oval Office date, though he finally was able to meet Mr. Trump at the United Nations on Wednesday. Instead, Mr. Trump continued to string the Ukrainian leader along and to withhold nearly $400 million in U.S. security aid appropriated by Congress while Mr. Giuliani pressed Mr. Zelensky\u2019s aides for an investigation of Mr. Biden as well as of the origin of revelations about criminal activity by Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman.\n\nThat Mr. Trump believed that this exchange would somehow exonerate him from charges that he abused his office is astonishing. That any member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, would conclude that it was \u201ca nothing . . . burger,\u201d in the words of the ever-more tolerant Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), only shows how degraded political norms have become under the Trump administration.\n\nJonathan Capehart: Nancy Pelosi has a responsibility. With impeachment, she intends to fulfill it.\n\nThere is much for Congress to follow up on. It was encouraging that Senate Republicans voted unanimously Tuesday in favor of a resolution calling for the administration to turn over a whistleblower complaint from a member of the intelligence community; that document, which was subsequently delivered to the Senate Intelligence Committee, almost certainly contains more than was revealed by the White House memo. Those Republicans, and their House colleagues, ought to join with Democrats in seeking sworn testimony from Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Barr and State Department officials about what exactly they communicated to the Ukrainians before and after the phone call.\n\nMr. Trump has confirmed that, at a minimum, he heavily pressured a foreign leader to intervene in the 2020 election, while dangling a political favor and withholding congressionally approved aid. The integrity of U.S. democracy depends on how Congress and the nation respond.\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
