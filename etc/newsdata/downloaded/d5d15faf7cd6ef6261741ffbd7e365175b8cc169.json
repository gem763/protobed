She is seeking $12 million in damages.\n\n\u201cHow dare you f------ disrespect me?,\u201d he said in the voicemail, in which he also told her: \u201cYou\u2019re f------ history.\u201d\n\nDe Niro's attorney, Tom Harvey, has called Robinson's allegations \"beyond absurd.\"\n\nDuring a sit-down interview with FOX Business, Robinson\u2019s attorney described De Niro's behavior towrad her client as \u201cabusive and demeaning.\"\n\n\u201cMs. Robinson was asked to do things that her male colleagues were never asked to do, like scratch Mr. De Niro's back, button his buttons, tie his ties,\u201d Alexandra Harwin added. \u201cThe whole work environment was unacceptable.\n\nDe Niro, whose company has filed a separate lawsuit accusing Robinson of misappropriating money, has been a vociferous critic of President Trump since his election in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis guy is like a gangster,\u201d he said in a recent profanity-laced interview on CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s come along and he\u2019s said things, done things, we say over and over again, 'This is terrible. We\u2019re in a terrible situation.'
