Hanach spoke to SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow about the incident \u2014 which was caught on video \u2014 in a Wednesday interview for the show\u2019s weekly TPUSA campus report.\n\n\u201c[The man] came over and smashed our boards, and walked over to the trash can, felt the need to stuff them into the trash can, and told us to \u2018stop spreading hate\u2019 on our campus, which I don\u2019t understand, because the boards he smashed were pro-liberty and pro-Second Amendment,\u201d said Hanach on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt just shows that people on the left aren\u2019t really willing to talk to us, they\u2019d rather just destroy our property instead,\u201d continued Hanach, adding that the incident had occurred just one day before the UNLV TPUSA group was set to host political commentator Tomi Lahren \u2014 which may have motivated the vandal\u2019s anger.\n\nListen below:\n\n\u201cI found that, especially on my campus, people don\u2019t want to have debates, like those people that came and protested us before the event started, they left five minutes after we confronted them. They don\u2019t want to have these talks, they don\u2019t want to have these debates, they just want to shut us down \u2014 even if it means labeling moderate conservatives as hateful and racist people.\u201d\n\nThe incident was also caught on video and posted to Facebook by TPUSA\u2019s UNLV group.\n\nWatch below:\n\n\u201cAre you proud of yourself? That\u2019s not your property,\u201d one female TPUSA group member can be heard asking in the video, moments before the man can begins punching the TPUSA signs into the trash can.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re spreading hate,\u201d the man responds, before walking away.\n\nHanach said that there was no reaction from the school with regards to the vandalism and intimidation his group was subjected to on campus, but that the conservative students did call campus police, who quickly arrived at the scene of the incident, but ultimately \u201ccouldn\u2019t find the guy who was responsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grew up in a conservative household, and not only that, looking at the insanity on the left \u2014 [it\u2019s] driven me away from the left,\u201d said Hanach, who added that this is his first semester being involved with TPUSA, and that the propaganda being promoted by leftists on campus will not deter him from staying involved with the conservative student organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that people try to paint a negative light on us based on lies and propaganda,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to stick with Turning Point throughout the rest of my college career, and I\u2019m definitely going to support them going forward, because I know what they\u2019re like \u2014 they\u2019re all very good people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to do what I do, I\u2019m proud to be a part of what I\u2019m a part of, and I wouldn\u2019t change anything about it.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) student and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter treasurer Michael Hanach told Breitbart News that a man approached him while he was promoting his group's\u00a0upcoming event on campus, stole TPUSA signage, and punched them into a nearby trash can.
