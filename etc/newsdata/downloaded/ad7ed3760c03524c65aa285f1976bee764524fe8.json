But following pressure from France, the IMF waived its 65-year-old age limit for applicants.\n\nWhat can we expect from her tenure at the IMF?\n\nMs Georgieva has been appointed for a five-year term, starting on 1 October.\n\nSpeaking after her selection by the IMF's executive board, she described herself as \"a firm believer in its mandate to help ensure the stability of the global economic and financial system through international co-operation\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nShe added: \"It is a huge responsibility to be at the helm of the IMF at a time when global economic growth continues to disappoint, trade tensions persist, and debt is at historically high levels.\"\n\nShe said the IMF's long-term aim was to support sound monetary, fiscal and structural policies to build stronger economies and improve people's lives.\n\n\"This means also dealing with issues like inequalities, climate risks and rapid technological change,\" she said.\n\n\"My goal is to further strengthen the Fund by making it even more forward-looking and attentive to the needs of our members.\"", "description": "Ms Georgieva, a former top World Bank official, becomes the first IMF boss from an emerging economy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B906/production/_108966374_imf_afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
