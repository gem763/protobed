The violent images, juxtaposed with a triumphant Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrating 70 years of Communist rule in Beijing, could now help drive momentum for the protests until local elections in November -- the next big date on the political calendar.\n\n\u201cPeople were expecting that the government and Beijing would have loved to see the end of everything by National Day,\u201d said Alvin Yeung, an opposition lawmaker. \u201cAnd obviously, it was a failure -- it was chaotic, and finally a real bullet has been shot at a student, which is a turning point.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are very angry and you can imagine that the general public, especially the younger protesters, will take their anger and turn it into real action, physical revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThis unrest will continue and could escalate.\u201d\n\nHong Kong police groups called on the government Wednesday to access powerful colonial-era laws to impose curfews and other measures to keep people off the streets. \u201cIn the face of such a massive series of rioting incidents, we cannot work alone without appropriate measures and support from the top level,\u201d Junior Police Officers\u2019 Association chairman Lam Chi-wai said in a statement.\n\nOver the last few months, pro-democracy demonstrators have seized on violent incidents to rally supporters in a movement that began four months ago to oppose a proposed bill allowing extradition to China.\n\nThere was a high-profile suicide of a protester in June. A month later alleged triad members viciously attacked black-shirted demonstrators on the subway. Then in August a woman was reportedly hit in the eye with a non-lethal round, prompting other protesters to start wearing bloody eye-patches and spray paint \u201can eye for an eye\u201d while storming the international airport.\n\n\u2018More Determined\u2019\n\nThe anger was palpable during a protest in central Hong Kong on Wednesday, even as reports emerged that the shot protester was in stable condition and expected to survive. Police fired more than 1,400 rounds of tear gas on Tuesday -- more than half of the total fired since protests began June 9 -- and fired six live bullets, five as warning shots.\n\n\u201cThe police force should be disbanded and get sanctioned for what they are doing,\u201d said a man surnamed Lee, who declined to give his full name as he chanted slogans with dozens of others. \u201cWe will fight on.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of the city\u2019s largest peaceful gatherings over the past few months, pledged a \u201clarge-scale mobilization\u201d as a result of the shooting.\n\n\u201cWe will be even more united, even more determined in our resistance,\u201d the group said in a Facebook post. \u201cFrom now on, October 1st will be an anniversary for the suppression of Hong Kong people with live rounds.\u201d\n\nSo far nobody has been killed in the protests, a fact that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam called \u201cquite remarkable\u201d last week. She has defended the police force and commended officers for using restraint in the face of attacks by some protesters wielding metal bars, hammers, bricks, and Molotov cocktails.\n\nWhile Lam withdrew the bill that initially sparked the protests in June, she has refused to give in to other demands by the protesters -- including an independent inquiry into police violence. That stance is backed by China, which has ruled out allowing Hong Kong to pick a ruler who will stand up to Beijing.\n\nSamson Yuen, an assistant professor at Lingnan University who has conducted numerous surveys among protesters including this week, said demonstrators are consistently saying they are motivated by the inability to choose their own political leaders rather than economic factors, as the government insists.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned about the illegitimacy of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe shooting will have a huge impact on the emotion among the protesters. And the fact that the police have insisted it was a right and reasonable action, this will definitely lead to a backlash among the protesters.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A Hong Kong police officer who fired a bullet into the chest of an 18-year-old protester may have inadvertently given new life to the months-long movement challenging Beijing\u2019s authority.Demonstrators hit the streets again on Wednesday following the release of videos showing the man getting", "authors": ["Iain Marlow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ia7jr07CdrBB2A2VN_oyXg--~B/aD04MjY7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/16647511901f6f7fc08eda0826ac1586", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
