The IOPC will assess whether Johnson should face a criminal investigation for misconduct in public office.\n\nVilliers told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think this whole thing has been blown out of all proportion. The prime minister is very clear that proprieties were observed. This seems to be pretty obviously a politically motivated complaint.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has been clear there is nothing to see here. I do feel this is a distraction and it is people seeking to use the complaints process in a highly political way.\u201d\n\nAn official from the GLA, London\u2019s devolved government, has written to the prime minister noting claims he had \u201con more than one occasion\u201d used his position as mayor to \u201cbenefit and reward\u201d Arcuri, a tech entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cSubject to any explanation provided by you, these matters give rise to a suggestion that there has been a failure to safeguard the public purse and if so that amounts to a significant breach of public trust,\u201d said the letter, from the office of the authority\u2019s monitoring officer.\n\n\u201cThese are the ingredients of the offence of misconduct in a public office.\u201d\n\nJohnson has been referred to the IOPC, which investigates complaints of misconduct connected to police in England and Wales.\n\nAs mayor Johnson was also the head of the Mayor\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime, a role equivalent to police and crime commissioner for the capital, hence his referral to the IOPC.\n\nSpeaking on the Today programme, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police Sir Peter Fahy, said Johnson\u2019s referral to the IOPC felt like it was \u201cstretching the system\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is an anomaly that the mayor of London and the mayor of Greater Manchester are also the police and crime commissioners, which isn\u2019t the situation in \u2026 other places. It does feel to be stretching the system a bit. There are other bodies that investigate misconduct in local government and that feels more appropriate to me.\u201d\n\nFahy also spoke about the issue of protecting politicians during a potential general election. \u201cThere are certain individuals and politicians who are lightning rods for protesters,\u201d he said.\n\nA senior government source said Johnson was given no warning of the announcement. \u201cThis is a politically motivated attack. Due process has not been followed and the timing is overtly political.\u201d\n\nThe shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, tweeted:", "description": "Minister says controversy over PM\u2019s links to US businesswoman have been overblown", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5d0554ffd8a5017df4f757d927336ecd19409b0/1531_410_4117_2470/master/4117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=979b94df2a765baf899d1bbea7d09fa1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
