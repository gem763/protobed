Yet sometimes, investors buy a popular dividend stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith only a two-year payment history, and a 1.8% yield, investors probably think Asko-Strakhovanie is not much of a dividend stock. Many of the best dividend stocks typically start out paying a low yield, so we wouldn't automatically cut it from our list of prospects. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nMISX:ACKO Historical Dividend Yield, October 14th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, Asko-Strakhovanie paid out of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Asko-Strakhovanie's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. This company's dividend has been unstable, and with a relatively short history, we think it's a little soon to draw strong conclusions about its long term dividend potential. During the past two-year period, the first annual payment was \u20bd3.76 in 2017, compared to \u20bd0.08 last year. As we can see, dividend payments have fallen heavily from where they were two years ago.\n\nWhen a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. We're glad to see Asko-Strakhovanie has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Unfortunately, the company has not been able to generate earnings growth, and cut its dividend at least once in the past. In summary, we're unenthused by Asko-Strakhovanie as a dividend stock. It's not that we think it is a bad company; it simply falls short of our criteria in some key areas.\n\nAre management backing themselves to deliver performance?
