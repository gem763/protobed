(Picture: AMC)\n\nAt the start of the episode, we\u2019re introduced to a huge herd of zombies coming for the characters we\u2019ve invested 10 years of our life into.\n\nAnd while we were convinced that the Whisperers had released the walkers to cause some trouble, it seems Alpha was just as shocked as Michonne with the presence of the dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLydia made it clear that her mother would have no way gone about declaring war like this, and we kind of believe her.\n\nLet\u2019s be serious, if Alpha wanted Daryl and his gang dead, he\u2019d be long gone by now.\n\nSo who the heck has sent hundreds of zombies Daryl, Carol and Michonne\u2019s way? Here\u2019s hoping for a new bad guy to replace the absence of Negan\u2019s old ways.\n\nWill we finally find out where Rick Grimes has gone?\n\nWhere has Rick Grimes gone? (Picture: AMC)\n\nWith a new enemy seemingly making its way to the gang, we can\u2019t help but think this means we\u2019ll finally find out where Rick Grimes was flown off to.\n\nWhen he tried to save his people in season nine, episode five, Jadis appeared in a helicopter and offered him to either A or B (Alpha and Beta?)\n\nSince then there has been no sign of either of the characters, but we\u2019re hoping we\u2019ll finally get some answers.\n\nWe know Rick is not returning to the series, despite chief content officer Scott Gimple recently hinting at a Rick and Daryl reunion.\n\nBut maybe some clues to the helicopter society will be revealed in the forthcoming episodes.\n\nIs Carol going mad?\n\nHas Carol lost her mind (Picture: AMC)\n\nCarol has not been herself since her adopted son with King Ezekiel was brutally beheaded by Alpha along with a whole host of other characters.\n\nAnd while she is coming to terms with her new single life, the grieving mother\u2019s sleep is starting to suffer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this, Carol barely knows what is real and what\u2019s a hallucination and she\u2019s even started to envision her son Henry again.\n\nMichonne is doubting Carol\u2019s mind, and doesn\u2019t believe her friend encountered the Whisperers in the woods.\n\nHowever, at the end of the episode, we\u2019re shown one of the Whisperers turning into a walker after they were shot by Carol \u2013 proving that she definitely saw them.\n\nWhy is Henry back on our screens?\n\nHenry is back \u2013 kind of (Picture: AMC)\n\nHenry was sagavly killed by Alpha when she beheaded him and placed his head on a stake.\n\nHowever, it seems his adopted mum Carol is starting to suffer from sleep loss and has started to hallucinate her late son.\n\nBut why is he back on our screens? Out of all the characters we have lost, surely there would be a better one to bring back than Henry?\n\nLike Carl? Or Rick? Or even Sasha!\n\nPart of us believes that Carol\u2019s visions are foreshadowing the future, and she will end up killing Alpha to avenge Henry\u2019s death.\n\nAfter all, Carol has to be the one to take out the show\u2019s current villain.\n\nWhen will Siddiq get with his new assistant Dante?\n\nSiddiq needs to fall for Dante (Picture: AMC)\n\nThe Walking Dead is definitely missing some kind of romantic storyline right now.\n\nCarl and Enid were killed off, Rick has been flown to a new society leaving Michonne on her own, and Carol and The King are no longer an item, it\u2019s lacking love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe even missing Henry\u2019s arc with Lydia \u2013 so we can\u2019t help but find ourselves shipping both Siddiq and Dante.\n\nThe newbie appears to be getting on well with the doctor and the duo have had some flirty encounters.\n\nFans were even served a heart to heart between the pair, so we\u2019re hoping it\u2019s just a matter of time.\n\nBecause if we\u2019re being honest \u2013 nothing is going on between Rosita and Siddiq (or Eugene in that case).\n\nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9pm on AMC in the US and Mondays at 9pm on Fox in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
