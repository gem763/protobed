The team promises all photos will be anonymized before being added to the database\n\nThe Bristol Stool Scale ranges from Type 1, defined as \u2018separate hard lumps\u2019 associated with constipation, to Type 7, which is \u2018liquid consistency with no solid pieces\u2019 and often associated with gut inflammation.\n\nWHAT IS THE BRISTOL STOOL SCALE? The Bristol-Stool Scale is a common diagnostic tool that classifies human feces in seven different types. Type 1 - Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass) Type 2 - Sausage-shaped but lumpy Type 3 - Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface Type 4 - Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft Type 5 - Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily) Type 6 - Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, mushy stool Type 7 - Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid\n\nNormal stool is associated with either Type 3, \u2018a sausage shape with cracks in the surface,\u2019 or Type 4. \u2018like a smooth, soft sausage or snake.\u2019\n\nTo ensure users' privacy is protected, the researchers will strip out all metadata and other identifying information attached to the photo before sending it to Auggi for analysis.\n\nTo begin with, the team made prototypes using Play-Doh to test Auggi\u2019s general shape recognition capability.\n\n\u2018We spent countless hours just making different Play-Doh models,\u2019 Auggi co-founder David Hachuel told The Verge.\n\n\u2018We actually 3D-printed a toilet just to emulate how that would happen in real life.\u2019\n\nLater the group turned to Reddit, where they found a substantial number of users already posting photos of their own bowel movements.\n\nThe Bristol Stool Scale was formalized in 1992 and ranks stool into seven different types\n\nThe long-term goal of the project is to create a tool that will let users better manage their own gut health, especially people struggling with digestive issues.\n\nPeople interested in participating can go to seed.com/poop.\n\nThe page will load on desktop computers but has been optimized for mobile phones.", "description": "79,000 people around the world are defecating at any given time.\u00a0 A new technology company wants 100,000 of them will be willing to turn around and take a picture after they've finished.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/17/20337754-0-image-a-22_1572369848822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
