Cheadle, a real-estate broker who approves of Republican economic policy, is reclassifying as an independent due to what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite superiority complex,\u201d and the failure of the party to stand up to the president\u2019s bullying, including his offensive tweets against nonwhite Democrats in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t had people called the names publicly that we have had with this administration,\u201d says Cheadle. \u201cTo stay on this ship now, as a black Republican, I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nDespite the loss of his African-American, at least some of the roughly 37 million African-Americans still support him. Trump\u2019s campaign has positioned a man they call \u201cMichael the Black man\u201d behind Trump at many rallies, where he holds a sign identifying himself as a member of (shrewdly using the plural) \u201cBlacks for Trump.\u201d His actual name is Maurice Symonette, not Michael. Also he is crazy.\n\nTrump has also thanked the African-American community for not voting. So even with \u201cmy African-American\u201d gone, he still has alternative ways of expressing his very deep support in the community.", "description": "During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump scanned his crowd, noticed a black face and blurted out, \u201cLook at my African-American over here!\u201d The man, Gregory Cheadle, is leaving the party, citing Trump\u2019s offensive statements.", "authors": ["Jonathan Chait"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/12/12-gregory-cheadle.w1200.h630.jpg"}
