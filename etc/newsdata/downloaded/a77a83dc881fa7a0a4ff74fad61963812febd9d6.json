As Bethany writes a short story tonight and shows the results to James Bailey (Nathan Graham), he soon recognises that part of the prose relates to her feelings for Daniel.\n\nBethany admits that she is falling for Daniel but swears James to secrecy \u2013 but this is a lust that will soon rear its head at the worst possible time. As Sinead\u2019s loved ones realise time is running out for the ailing local, they plan an early Christmas celebration for her.\n\nBut as the festivities get underway next week, Sinead and Daniel end up arguing and as the pressure mounts, Daniel storms out and opens up to Bethany. It leads to him sharing a kiss with her, something which he immediately regrets \u2013 and Ken Barlow (William Roache) catches him in the act and orders him to go back to his dying wife\u2019s side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about how this will impact things going forward, show boss Iain MacLeod explained: \u2018It\u2019s emotionally complex. Bethany certainly thinks she\u2019s in love with Daniel, but as Audrey says to her in an episode, to what degree does she love Daniel and to what degree does she love this romantic Byronic figure who\u2019s crying on a windswept moor because he\u2019s lost his wife? Is she in love with that fantasy Daniel, or the real man? Does she even know the real man?\n\n\u2018For Daniel\u2019s part, the story going forward is about loneliness, isolation and it\u2019s about the Barlow family not knowing to what degree they should wade in, and try to take over and look after baby Bertie for him, and to what degree should they back off.\u2019\n\nCoronation Street airs an hour long episode on Friday 18th October at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "How will Daniel respond in Corrie?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/21_10_coro_bethany_daniel_2nd_ep_01-f33d_1571331180.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
