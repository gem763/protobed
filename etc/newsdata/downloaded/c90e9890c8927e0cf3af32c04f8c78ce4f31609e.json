Today, men make up just 14 percent of the direct care work force. But the number of male home care workers is rising \u2014 tripling to 182,000 in 2015 from 60,000 in 2005. Home care work is where the biggest unmet demand is expected.\n\nSo how are more men recruited into a field historically dominated by women?\n\nBottom line: If you want to recruit anyone into this field, men included, you have to raise wages. The median hourly wage for home care workers in the United States is a little more than $10. The median annual income for home care workers, most of whom work part-time or only during part of the year, is $13,800. (A majority of those surveyed said they would like full-time work.)\n\nRetention is a huge challenge. \u201cThere are no reliable statistics on turnover in this sector, but our estimate is that it\u2019s somewhere around 60 to 80 percent,\u201d Mr. Espinoza said. \u201cThat\u2019s devastating for the workers and the families that benefit from their care.\u201d\n\nWhile wages remain low, strives have been made in job protections. The Fair Labor Standards Act, originally passed in 1938, exempted home care workers from overtime protections, claiming they were mere \u201ccompanions.\u201d But in 2010, a coalition of organizations finally got the law amended to cover home care workers.\n\n\u201cThis work force sits at the intersection of two cultural problems,\u201d Mr. Espinoza said, \u201cthe devaluing of working-class women and the devaluing of older people and people with disabilities. That confluence of sexism, racism, ageism and ableism means the sector gets ignored.\u201d\n\nStudies show that when women enter fields in greater numbers, pay declines. Could the reverse also be true? Could more men in direct care work help boost wages for everyone? Paula England, a sociologist and professor at New York University, thinks it\u2019s possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a logical extension,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the reason pay goes down when women go in is that employers somehow devalue it, you would think that would operate in the reverse. As men go in, we would see that work as substantial and more important. But we don\u2019t really have examples of that.\u201d\n\nThe quality of care jobs will have to rise to attract more workers, and the pathways to get hired have to be redesigned. An interesting example is to be found in Albany, Minn., at Mother of Mercy Senior Living. Facing both the general shortage and the particular challenges posed in rural communities with dwindling populations (Albany has fewer than 3,000 people), Mother of Mercy\u2019s leaders struggled to recruit workers for years.", "description": "The shortage of caregivers around the country has opened a constructive path for men seeking work, including some who have served time in prison.", "authors": ["Courtney E.
