He told relatives of the victims in a private meeting earlier this week that he was working on preventing the release of any more. So far 77 of 142 suspects detained have been released by courts.\n\nThe official account of the incident released by the previous government stated the students were killed and then incinerated by gang members after their abduction. Investigators have only definitively identified the remains of one of the 43.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said in a report last year that Mexican authorities had probably tortured dozens of people during the investigation.\n\n(Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz; Additional reporting by Diego Ore; Writing by Stefanie Eschenbacher; Editing by Jane Wardell)", "description": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will open a new investigation into the 2014 disappearance and apparent massacre of 43 students, authorities said on Wednesday, a controversial case that caused a crisis for the previous government and drew international criticism.", "authors": ["Lizbeth Diaz"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
