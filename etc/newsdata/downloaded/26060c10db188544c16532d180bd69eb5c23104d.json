Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like inside.", "language": "en", "text": "caption The Starbucks inside of Disneyland has special drinks and snacks. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nDisneyland in California has a special Market House coffee shop with a Starbucks inside of it.\n\nThis Starbucks location features exclusive themed drinks and Mickey-shaped snacks.\n\nThe coffee shop also has classic Starbucks fare, like cake pops, teas, and cold brew.\n\nOverall, this Disneyland location is on par with your typical Starbucks \u2013 but it\u2019s a bit more magical because of its themed atmosphere and specialty offerings.\n\nVisit Insider\u2019s homepage for more.\n\nVisitors who aim to have a unique experience when they visit Disneyland might be tempted to skip the park\u2019s Starbucks location.\n\nBut if you\u2019re assuming this Starbucks is just another typical branch of the giant coffee chain, think again.\n\nThe coffee shop inside the Anaheim, California, park is actually pretty unique, especially when it comes to drinks, snacks, atmosphere, and merchandise. It can also be a bit difficult to find.\n\nHere\u2019s what it\u2019s really like visiting the Starbucks location inside of Disneyland.\n\nUnless you have a map, the Starbucks inside of Disneyland can be tough to find because it perfectly blends in with Main Street.\n\ncaption You won\u2019t see any giant, green mermaid logo here. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nLocated on Disneyland\u2019s Main Street, the Starbucks is actually inside of the building called the Market House.\n\nWith its brick exterior and old-timey signs, the place is designed to fit in with Disneyland\u2019s Main Street, which is why it doesn\u2019t resemble your typical modern Starbucks, which is known for its dark and sleek decor.\n\nAfter looking closely at the window, I found a version of the Starbucks logo.\n\ncaption That\u2019s a real Starbucks logo from the 1970s. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThe Market House has been open for decades, but it only really got a Starbucks-style makeover in 2013.\n\nKeeping with the old-school theme, this location features one of Starbucks\u2019 first logos.\n\nThis brown design, which features a two-tailed creature was first introduced in 1971 and lasted throughout the early 1980s,\n\nNotably, this logo is brown and not Starbucks\u2019 now-signature green.\n\nInside, the store was decorated in a cozy way, with wood paneling and floral wallpaper.\n\ncaption The interior featured shades of brown and beige. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nStepping inside almost feels like entering a time machine.\n\nRight off the bat, I knew this place was very different from the more modern-looking Starbucks locations I have visited before.\n\nAlthough many Starbucks locations prominently feature dark green and black, this one was filled with warm brown and beige tones.\n\nThe place was crowded and had two long lines, which isn\u2019t surprising since we\u2019re at Starbucks and Disneyland at the same time.\n\ncaption There was plenty to look at. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nLike with most Starbucks I have been to, I had to stand in a pretty long line before placing my order \u2013 but I didn\u2019t mind the wait this time.\n\nI had plenty to look at while I stood in line, like the wood-paneled counter, giant glass display case, and funky light fixtures.\n\nRead More: 14 Disneyland attractions with the shortest wait times\n\nThe menu had just about everything you\u2019d find at a typical Starbucks.\n\ncaption The menu was located behind the main counter. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThe menu board was a bit more whimsical and it was even framed in a stylish gold border.\n\nIt seemed like customers could get basically any drink they\u2019d typically order at Starbucks, from teas and lattes to refreshers and Frappuccinos.\n\nThere were seasonal favorites here, too, but they might cost more than what you\u2019d pay at a typical Starbucks.\n\ncaption I visited in the fall, so there were a few pumpkin options. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nAt this location you can also order seasonal favorites, like the pumpkin-spice latte or pumpkin-cream cold brew \u2013 but you can probably expect to pay slightly higher than usual prices.\n\nFor example, a tall pumpkin-spice latte costs about $4.25 to $5.06 or so at usual Starbucks locations around the US. Here, the tall was $5.49.\n\nThe price difference isn\u2019t too drastic or too surprising to me. After all, this is Disneyland \u2026 and the park isn\u2019t exactly known for being cheap.\n\nThat said, the sign also showed off some exclusive Disney Parks cups that have colorful designs on the side. I was looking forward to getting my drink in one of these.\n\nThis location is also known for offering special Disney-inspired beverages.\n\ncaption I was most excited for these spooky drinks. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThis Starbucks location is known for regularly offering special drinks inspired by Disney characters and events.\n\nIn the past, they\u2019ve had ones inspired by places like Fantasyland and films like \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d\n\nSince I was visiting during late September, this Starbucks was currently offering two Halloween drinks named after Disney villains.\n\nThe Maleficent Frappuccino, inspired by the \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d villain, was a \u201cblueberry and vanilla bean creme Frappuccino blended with diced dragon fruit, topped with matcha tea whipped cream.\u201d\n\nThe Dr. Facilier Elixir was an iced tea named after the villain from \u201cPrincess And The Frog.\u201d It was described as a \u201clayered chai tea and lemonade iced beverage topped with a splash of passion fruit tea.\u201d\n\nI decided to order both.\n\nI also wanted to get some special treats to go with my drinks.\n\ncaption There were a few Mickey-shaped cookies available. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThis location also offered some of the same bakery and hot items that are available in almost every Starbucks, like cake pops, coffee cake, chocolate croissants, and even Sous Vide egg bites.\n\nThat said, the location had a few special sweets that were exclusive to Disney parks, including Mickey-shaped cookies and treats with Mickey\u2019s face on them.\n\nI ordered two cookies, one inspired by \u201cFrozen\u201d and one shaped like a bat.\n\nWhile waiting for my order, I noticed the people behind the counter were wearing special uniforms.\n\ncaption The baristas had yellow bandanas and dresses instead of green aprons. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThe Starbucks employees are technically called cast members since they work at Disneyland \u2013 and they even had special uniforms that fit in with the coffee shop\u2019s vintage theme.\n\nThey wore outfits that consisted of yellow dresses with white collars and matching bandanas. And instead of donning green aprons, some of the cast members wore light-brown aprons with white detailing.\n\nI also noticed that this Starbucks had tons of special Disney merchandise for sale.\n\ncaption The merchandise was Disneyland themed. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nMost Starbucks locations around the globe sell stylish mugs and cold cups, but this location had a special Disney selection.\n\nOn the shelves, I saw commemorative mugs styled after the popular \u201cYou are here\u201d line from Starbucks around the globe. These featured park-specific icons, like Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle and a carousel horse.\n\nI also saw smaller, ornament-sized mugs, cold cups, and travel mugs.\n\ncaption These products are park exclusives, too. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThis merchandise is all exclusive to Disney parks, meaning it cannot be purchased at other Starbucks stores outside of the Disney bubble.\n\nAfter waiting for a few minutes, I brought my drinks and snacks outside to give them a taste.\n\ncaption The Frappuccino was a purplish pink. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nFirst up was the Maleficent Frappuccino, which cost $5.19 for a tall.\n\nThis caffeine-free drink was filled to the top with colorful whipped cream \u2013 unfortunately, it was not served in one of the special Disney Parks cups I had seen on the menu board.\n\nThat said, this drink was tasty although it felt more like a dessert than a beverage. In terms of flavor, I definitely got more dragon fruit than I did blueberry.\n\nI think the matcha whipped cream would be a hit with any fan of the green-colored tea, and felt like the Frappuccino itself tasted a lot like a creamy version of Starbucks\u2019 popular Mango Dragon Fruit Refresher.\n\nNext up was the Dr. Facilier Elixir, which cost $4.79 for a tall.\n\ncaption This was my favorite. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThe layered chai tea and lemonade drink was easily my favorite of the two.\n\nThe chai and lemonade worked well together, and the splash of passion-fruit tea gave it a sweeter kick.\n\nIt also looked really cool and seemed to have a gradient that went from green to red.\n\nOverall, these drinks were both pretty tasty and beautiful.\n\ncaption Both drinks were perfect for an Instagram photo. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nBoth of these drinks certainly seemed more magical than typical specialty beverages you could get at Starbucks, although it\u2019s hard to expect anything less at Disneyland.\n\nPlus, I was really impressed that these drinks were both so colorful and Instagram-worthy \u2013 especially since some of the chain\u2019s specialty beverages (like the famous Tie-Dye Frap) don\u2019t always look as pretty in real life.\n\nThat said, I was sort of disappointed they weren\u2019t given to me in the special patterned Disney Parks cups I\u2019d seen on the menus inside of the Starbucks and on Instagram.\n\nI also tried two specialty desserts that you can only snag inside the parks.\n\ncaption I felt like this cookie was worth the price. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThe Halloween-themed Mickey bat cookie cost $3.99.\n\nIt was a simple iced shortbread and it basically felt on par with any dessert I\u2019d expect to get from a Starbucks.\n\nI thought it was tasty, buttery, and definitely worth the price because of how beautiful it looked. Truthfully, I can imagine people buying this cookie just to take a photo of it.\n\nRead More: 11 amusement parks around the US that go all-out for Halloween\n\nI also got a blueberry sugar cookie that was inspired by \u201cFrozen.\u201d\n\ncaption This was messier than I\u2019d hoped it would be. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nThe Arendelle Aqua cookie cost $4.49 and was topped with colorful icing and a snowflake-shaped design.\n\nUnfortunately, my cookie, although beautiful in the display case, was a bit of a mess by the time I left the coffee shop.\n\nAfter opening my pastry bag, I noticed the cookie had entirely fallen apart and crumbled because of how soft it was.\n\nAnd although it was really messy to eat, it was quite delicious and had a strong blueberry flavor.\n\nOverall, this Disneyland location is on par with your typical Starbucks \u2014 but it\u2019s a little bit more magical.\n\ncaption These special drinks were definitely the best part. source Nicole Pomarico\n\nStarbucks generally offers up the same experience at every location, but visiting the one inside Disneyland felt extra special, especially in terms of drinks, treats, and atmosphere.\n\nAlthough I wouldn\u2019t go all the way to this location just to grab my typical morning Starbucks order, I\u2019ll definitely be back to try more of the ever-changing themed specialty drinks and snacks.\n\nRead More:", "description": "Business Insider - The California spot sells exclusive Frappuccinos, teas, and merchandise that you can only get inside the park..
