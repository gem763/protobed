But private prisons still thrive.", "language": "en", "text": "Now, analysts have begun to worry about a future financing crunch for the two companies that together account for 80 percent of the private prison industry. But it remains far from a death knell.\n\nAD\n\nActing homeland security chief frustrated and isolated \u2014 even as he delivers what Trump wants at the border\n\nMoody\u2019s recently listed among GEO Group\u2019s challenges: \u201cReduced access to capital as lenders and investors stop financing private prison operators.\u201d Fitch Ratings lowered CoreCivic\u2019s debt rating and its outlook to \u201cnegative.\"\n\nAD\n\nAs a real estate investment trust, CoreCivic must return most of its profits to shareholders and relies on its ability to borrow money to refinance existing debt, according to Fitch Ratings, which downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating in July. That could become more difficult as the large banks that traditionally represent a key, stable source of funding refuse to lend to private prison companies, Fitch analysts Gabriel Foguel and Stephen Boyd said.\n\n\u201cNot having access to [these] stable sources of financing contributed to our negative outlook,\u201d Foguel said in an interview this week.\n\nAD\n\nWithout the major banks, CoreCivic could seek out other sources of funding, including issuing new stock or finding a non-bank lender such as a private equity investor or hedge fund, the analysts said. But those sources are less stable than major bank funding, Foguel said, and it remains unclear whether those alternatives will be enough.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see if they will be able to reach some of those [alternative financing deals] in the next one to two years,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nPart of the concern is that investors\u2019 focus on social issues is spreading and could close off more financing avenues for CoreCivic, the analysts said. Stockholders may decide this is an industry in which they don\u2019t want to invest. \u201cThere are some signs that other capital markets providers are uninterested in lending to the sector,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nAD\n\nCoreCivic and GEO Group have already started to see interest from smaller regional banks that could fill in the gap or they could work with private equity, said Reed Valutas, lead analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. In a few years, when the companies need to secure new loans, the big banks that recently said they wouldn\u2019t work with private detention centers in the future may have a different perspective, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know the landscape or horizon of what is going to happen. Things are constantly evolving and changing in this industry,\u201d said Valutas.\n\nBut if they have trouble securing loans in the future, \u201cthat could prevent them from growing,\u201d said Valutas. The companies are stable, he said, \u201cthe issue is whether they can continue to grow if they can\u2019t tap the capital markets in the same way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe stock price of both companies has fallen about 30 percent since June.\n\nCompany executives, too, have publicly acknowledged potential hurdles even as they sought to reassure shareholders.\n\nDuring an August conference call with analysts, Damon Hininger, CoreCivic\u2019s chief executive, called the banks\u2019 decision to cease financing the industry \u201ca result of politically motivated threats.\u201d The banks had \u201cclearly bowed down to a small group of activists,\u201d he said. But he said that CoreCivic still has \u201cplenty of financial partners\u201d and that he remains \u201cconfident in our ability to cost-effectively manage our balance sheet and excess capital when necessary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut David M. Garfinkle, CoreCivic\u2019s chief financial officer, said during the same call that \u201cthe price of our debt and equity have been affected\u201d by the headlines.\n\nMore than half a dozen major banks have either divested or are in the process of divesting from the private detention sector. JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, announced that it would stop financing the industry profiting from immigrant detention in March, following similar moves by Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank.\n\nIn June, just weeks after extending a line of credit to a major private prison company, Bank of America became one of the last big Wall Street banks to say it would sever ties with the industry. SunTrust, BNP Paribas and Fifth Third soon followed.\n\nAD\n\nBanks bow to pressure to stop profiting from Trump\u2019s immigration policy, but Big Tech remains defiant\n\nAccording to a July report by public interest groups, the six major banks that have withdrawn from the industry represent an estimated $1.93 billion, or 72 percent of the total current financing available to private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group. By August, two more banks \u2014 PNC and Barclays \u2014 said they would no longer finance the industry. Together, the eight banks account for 87 percent of the loans and credit available to these companies, according to a research update by the public interest groups.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that misleading political activism has been allowed to impact decade-long banking relationships,\u201d GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez said in a statement. \u201cThe divestment efforts against our company are based on a false narrative and a deliberate mischaracterization of our role as a long-standing government services provider.\u201d\n\nGEO Group warned investors in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in July that if other banks stopped doing business with the company because of increased public resistance to the private detention industry, it \u201ccould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our securities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn an SEC filing in August, CoreCivic said that it could not guarantee that other banks wouldn\u2019t decide to stop financing the industry, which could have a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on the company.\n\nAD\n\nActivists say they are continuing to pressure five smaller regional banks that have not committed to pulling out of the private prison industry. They are: Regions, Birmingham; Citizens, Providence, R.I.; Pinnacle, Nashville; First Tennessee, Memphis; and Synovus, Columbus, Ga.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that people have differing views about the private sector\u2019s involvement in prisons,\u201d said Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Regions, in a statement. She would not comment on the banks\u2019 investment in private prisons. \u201cThis is a complex issue that government officials and policymakers are in the best position to address directly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeter Lucht, a Citizens spokesman, said the bank does not discuss specific clients or industry exposures. \u201cWe do maintain a commitment to lending to companies that conduct their business in a socially responsible manner,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIf that is not the case we are prepared to exit those relationships.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLee Underwood, a Synovus spokesman, said the bank does not comment on plans with its customers.\n\nPinnacle and First Tennessee did not respond to a request for comment about their financing plans for the prison companies.\n\nDespite the uncertain financial forecasts for GEO Group and CoreCivic, activist protests have not appeared to hit the prison companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nNor have the banks\u2019 withdrawals from financing detention center companies in the future affected CoreCivic\u2019s day-to-day operations, said Amanda Gilchrist, spokeswoman for the company. The company\u2019s \u201cfiscal health has been unaffected by these bank announcements,\u201d she said, \u201cand we have seen a positive response from many other banks that are interested in working with us.\u201d\n\nDuring the first half of 2019, CoreCivic\u2019s profits increased 27 percent, to $98 million, compared with the same period last year, and the Nashville-based company said it would bring in more profits than it initially expected this year.\n\nAD\n\nGEO Group\u2019s profit increased 14 percent, to $83 million, during the first half of the year, and the company anticipates bringing in $2.47 billion in revenue this year. The company, based in Boca Raton, Fla., is planning to have 5,700 more detention beds available by the end of the year, bringing in more than $100 million in additional annual revenue.\n\nThe companies continue to be buoyed by government contracts, which began to grow amid the Central American refugee crisis in President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. In 2015, CoreCivic and GEO Group received a total of $884 million, according to an analysis of federal contracting records by Public Citizen, a liberal consumer rights advocacy group.\n\nThe windfall continued under Trump. Last year, CoreCivic and GEO Group \u2014 the largest beneficiaries \u2014 received $1 billion in federal contracts, the vast majority of which came from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the Public Citizen analysis.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff is very much associated with Trump in the public imagination, but the trends were set during the Obama administration,\u201d said Alan Zibel, a research director at Public Citizen who wrote a recent report on the federal contracts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a death knell for the industry by any means.\"\n\nActivists, while hopeful that the loss of financing could hamper the prison companies\u2019 growth and viability, say they have no doubt that the companies will find a way to stay afloat.\n\nGEO Group is expected to reopen a private prison in Baldwin, Mich., in the coming days to incarcerate noncitizens as part of a 10-year contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, according to a recent news report.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has a commitment to make private detention a thing,\u201d L\u00f3pez Varona said.", "description": "Private prison giants CoreCivic and GEO Group have been abandoned by Wall Street and seen their stock prices plummet.
