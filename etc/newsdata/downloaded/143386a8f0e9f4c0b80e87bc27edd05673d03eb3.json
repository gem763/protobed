Just Google the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation and run with that. If you\u2019re curious about what those numbers mean in a practical sense, check out this video.\n\nCar YouTuber ChrisFix seems to be branching out from his usual \u201chow to repair something\u201d content into somewhat broader topics, and this video explains why higher octane gasoline isn\u2019t necessarily better and it doesn\u2019t store more energy.\n\nOctane ratings are about knock resistance, not explosive power. The higher the octane rating, the less likely the fuel is to prematurely detonate. But as long as your engine\u2019s running correctly, that\u2019s only a possibility if the engine\u2019s designed a certain way. Typically, with a turbocharger or very high compression.\n\nChrisFix also explains why the octane ratings on European gasoline pumps often seem higher than American ones \u2013 they\u2019re just using a different scale over there. The juice flowing through the pump is largely the same.\n\nThe second half of the video focuses on detailing the residue that low-quality petrol can leave behind, but as far as practical advice there, all you really need to know is that \u201cTop Tier\u201d branded fuels are generally going to have the most detergent characteristics. In other words, if the petrol station is a brand you\u2019ve heard of, you\u2019re probably OK. Exploring the different proprietary additives that each petrol brand adds will have to be a project for another time.\n\nBut the real reason I wanted to share this video is the cutaway animation at about the three-minute mark. There, you can see a very clear illustration of the combustion process: fuel and air in, fuel and air compressed, fuel and air ignited, exhaust out. That\u2019s compared to an engine experiencing detonation\u2013the fuel exploding too soon, basically.\n\nEven if you already knew that the clip is still a neat way to experience it. It\u2019s not like you can watch your engine run from the inside-out at a low speed in real life, anyway. Hopefully, you either learned something here or found yourself a super-simple explanation to send to your friends when they ask if they need to run premium fuel.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Jalopnik.", "description": "If you\u2019re scratching your head wondering which number petrol to put in your car, don\u2019t overthink it.
