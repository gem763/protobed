The move away from floppy disks was completed in June but was not widely reported at the time. It was reported last week by C4ISRNET, a website that covers military technology.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

It said the disks were used in a system that \u201ccoordinates the operational functions of the nation\u2019s nuclear forces.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Which countries have nuclear weapons?

Because the systems are not connected to the internet, they are exceptionally secure: Hackers can\u2019t break into a floppy disk.\n\nAll of this may leave the modern reader wondering: What is a floppy disk?\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He said he thought it had been roughly five years since anyone had manufactured a new disk.\n\n\u201cA big industrial machine that is designed to last 30, 40 or 50 years and in fact does last 30, 40 or 50 years \u2014 do you throw it away because there is a new way to get information onto the machine?\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, what is the cost of using the floppy disk as opposed to the cost of transitioning to something else like a USB drive or linking to the internet?\u201d\n\nThat said, floppy disks have some advantages over other methods of information transfer, like a Wi-Fi link or a flash drive, Mr Persky said.\n\n\u201cWe have an old technology that is not easily hackable, that is not expensive, that is extremely well understood, it is extremely stable, and as long as the bits of information you are trying to get into a machine are small, a floppy disk is a perfectly good and OK thing to use,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it going to be OK to use in five or 10 or 15 years? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nMr Persky outlined the many drawbacks of \u201cphysical media\u201d like floppy disks: They hold less data than can be uploaded via the internet; they are slow and expensive to distribute; you need to find a specialist repairman if the machines needed to read them break down; and, of course, no one had made a new one in five years.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly some advantages to physical media and huge, overwhelming disadvantages to physical media,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd physical media will go away, but it just hasn\u2019t gone away yet. That is a long, complicated, messy business. Or at least I hope.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Rest easy, people of Earth: The United States\u2019 nuclear arsenal will no longer rely on a computer system that uses 8-inch floppy disks, in an update the Defence Department has cast as a step into the future but which some observers might be surprised to learn was required at all.", "authors": ["Liam Stack"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/15/floppy-disks-nuclear.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
