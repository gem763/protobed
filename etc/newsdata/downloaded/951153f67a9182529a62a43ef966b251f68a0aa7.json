Turkey considers them a \"terrorist group\".\n\nReversing Trump's plan\n\nThe US House measure now wants a halt to Turkey's military actions in Syria, and says the US should send humanitarian aid to the embattled Kurds.\n\nTurkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ruled out on Tuesday a ceasefire of the military operation in Syria [Anadolu]\n\nIt also calls on Trump to produce \"a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat\" of ISIL.\n\nEarlier, it was reported that hundreds of suspected ISIL members managed to escape as Turkish troops started shelling northeast Syria.\n\nThe House move followed Trump's decision to impose sanctions on Turkey over the operation in the border area.\n\n\"We have always maintained that, while certainly needed, a sanctions package alone is insufficient for reversing this humanitarian disaster,\" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement introducing the House resolution.\n\nIn a separate statement, Pelosi said Trump's \"terribly dangerous decision\" on Syria, gave the \"greenlight to Turkey to commit this humanitarian disaster on the Kurds, making us an untrustworthy ally.\"\n\nAn identical bipartisan measure is being introduced in the Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ruled out a ceasefire, adding that it was \"not negative\" for the Syrian army to enter Manbij, as long as fighters in the area were cleared.\n\nTrump has come under sharp criticism from members of Congress, including from many in his Republican Party, who view the withdrawal as an abandonment of Kurdish forces and fear what it means for the battle against ISIL.\n\nRepublican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a reminder on Tuesday that a veto-proof majority of 70 senators voted earlier this year against such a pullout.\n\nHe suggested Trump's move had created \"a power vacuum begging for the meddling influence of Russia\", and leaving Syria open for Iran to advance its reach \"unimpeded\" towards Israel.\n\nSchumer criticised Trump for scuttling the years of progress he said American and Syrian Kurdish forces had made against ISIL \"in one fell, quick, unthought-out swoop\".\n\nAl Jazeera's Patty Culhane, reporting from Washington DC, said that Trump \"seemed pretty shocked\" at the bipartisan opposition to his decision.\n\n\"He's getting criticism from across the political spectrum,\" she said, adding that the president is dispatching Vice President Mike Pence to Turkey to convince Erdogan to halt the military operation.", "description": "Trump's Republican allies, opposition Democrats set to vote on resolution rebuking his decision to ditch Kurdish allies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/7feaabc6c39b4039bfa19f24195cd7fe_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
