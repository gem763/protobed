Katie Hill is threatening to sue the Daily Mail tabloid news site after it published nude pictures of her with a campaign aide with whom she had a relationship.\n\nHer attorneys accused the outlet, a sister publication of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, of breaching revenge-porn laws in California that prohibit the unauthorized sharing of explicit photos.\n\nLawyers for Hill, who represents the 25th District of California, said the site also defamed her by claiming that she had a \"Nazi-era\" tattoo on her pelvic area.\n\nA letter from the lawyers obtained by Politico said: \"You have also exposed your publication to grave legal consequences for California has some of the strongest criminal laws in the United States against the secretive generation and distribution of private, sexual images.\n\n\"The California Penal Code accordingly makes it a criminal offense to 'intentionally distribute the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person.'\"\n\nIt added that \"the claim that Representative Hill has Nazi imagery on her body in the form of a tattoo is false and defamatory.\"\n\nIt demanded that the Mail take down the story immediately. As of Friday morning, the story was still on the Mail's website.\n\nThe outlet did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on the threatened lawsuit.\n\nHill is the vice chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which is part of the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a letter to constituents on Wednesday, Hill said she'd had an \"inappropriate\" relationship with a campaign aide.\n\n\"I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,\" Hill wrote. \"For that I apologize. I wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.\"\n\nLast week, the conservative blog RedState published a nude picture of Hill brushing the hair of a person who it said was the aide.\n\nThe site said that it received the information from \"multiple confidential sources\" and that Hill and her estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, were in a polyamorous relationship with the woman. Further images were published by the Mail on Thursday, including one appearing to show the tattoo.\n\nSeparately, the House Ethics Committee said in a statement Wednesday that it was launching an inquiry into RedState's allegations that Hill violated ethics rules by having a relationship with another staffer, named by the blog as Graham Kelly, since her election to the House last year.\n\nThe committee noted that the investigation \"does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.\"\n\nIn her letter, Hill denied having a relationship with Kelly.\n\n\"Allegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false,\" Hill said.\n\nKelly and Heslep did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nHill wrote that she had alerted the Capitol Police to the publication of the intimate pictures by RedState.\n\n\"Distributing intimate photos with the intent to publish them is a crime, and the perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law,\" she wrote. \"I have notified Capitol Police, who are investigating it, and therefore will have no further comment on the matter.\"\n\nShe said the source of the allegations and pictures was Heslep, whom she is divorcing and whom she described as abusive and \"determined to try to humiliate me.\"", "description": "Rep.
