We're not talking about a player who should be playing second fiddle because he is so good.\n\n'But sometimes you just have to accept it. He mentioned it himself, Aguero is a legend. A couple of years ago it looked like he would be the number one striker, but Sergio rose to the challenge because there was talk that he might have to leave.\n\n'I was very impressed with him. You can see he\u2019s thoroughly enjoying his game, and he's not the sort of guy who's going to cause a problem. When you see his smile after scoring a goal like that, that\u2019s what football\u2019s all about.'\n\nThe City star even admitted that his landmark goal for the club had arrived with a hint of fortune, after his attempted header appeared to clip his shoulder before beating Wayne Hennessey.\n\nThe talented Brazilian had nodded home an inch-perfect Bernardo Silva cross for his landmark\n\n'I tried a header, but I think it hit my shoulder!' Jesus said.\n\n'I have to improve this side because I sometimes have difficulties with headers. What a cross from Bernardo as well. A little bit lucky!'\n\nJesus has netted in all five starts handed to him by Pep Guardiola away from home this term, but the Brazilian explained he had to continue working hard to contest with Aguero in the pecking order.\n\nHe added: 'I have to work and improve my football all the time, because I have Aguero with me. He\u2019s a legend for City, top scorer for the club. I have to work every day for when I go to the pitch and help my teammates.\n\nThe 22-year-old proved a constant menace at Selhurst Park as the champions eased to victory\n\n'I cannot stop. I can try every time to start the game. I always respect the manager\u2019s decision. I try my best every day.'\n\nThe frontman has now become the seventh player throughout the Spaniard's managerial career to register 50 goals, and Redknapp also highlighted the importance of Guardiola's guidance for Jesus' half-century.\n\nHe said: 'That\u2019s a testament to him, and he\u2019s going to get better. When you speak to Manchester City players it\u2019s always like an education, and that\u2019s obviously what Pep brings to them.
