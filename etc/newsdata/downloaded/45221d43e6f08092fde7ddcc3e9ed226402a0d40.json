A thousand thoughts kept calling out, \u201cWhat about me? I\u2019m important, too!\u201d\n\n\n\nWorries seemed to be my entire mental diet. As i sat trying to meditate one day, an image came powerfully to my mind. \u201cTime is like a river on which you are floating. You can never occupy more than one place at any moment. Just focus your whole attention on where you are right now, and let the river take care of itself.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat image had an uncanny power to help me stay focussed. Whenever i found my attention wandering to worries, i would visualise the river and find that it helped me come back to my centre.\n\n\n\nMeditation can help us centre our attention, but we must be deeply relaxed before its effects can take hold. There exists a direct link between breath and mind. The science of controlling the mind through breathing techniques is one of India\u2019s great gifts to the world.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed that whenever you attempt a task that requires deep concentration, such as threading a needle, your breathing automatically slows, or even stops.\n\n\n\nThe next time your mind tries to run away from you, try breathing your way to calmness.A fellow disciple was in charge of training recruits for the San Francisco police department. A technique that he taught the rookies was to control their breathing before they attempted to take control of a tense situation. He demonstrated the importance of breath-control with the following true story: During a drug raid, he chased a man up a stairway in a darkened building. At the top of the stairs, he turned and found the suspect pointing a shotgun at his chest. The man was high on drugs and he knew that one false move could be fatal.While gazing into the man\u2019s eyes, he began breathing deeply while affirming mentally, \u201cBe calm, be centred.\u201d After a few moments he slowly held out his hand and asked the man to give him the gun. The man\u2019s shoulders slumped as the tension went out of him, and he surrendered without violence.There are many breathing techniques that can help us relax the mind. For example, \u201cregular breathing\u201d is extremely helpful at the start of a meditation. Simply inhale slowly, counting to twelve. Hold the breath for the same number of counts while concentrating with deep calmness at the point between the eyebrows. Then slowly exhale for the same twelve counts. Do six to nine rounds as you start to meditate. You can increase or decrease the count according to your capacity, but keep inhalation, retention, and exhalation equal.Regular breathing can help us greatly in a variety of situations. Whenever you are feeling stressed and nervous, do a few rounds of regular breathing \u2013 i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll notice an immediate calming influence. You can rarely think yourself out of a negative or anxious state, but you can often breathe yourself out of it.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/746961-1350-420-5/finding-calmness-in-the-midst-of-activity.img", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
