ISRAEL ADESANYA\n\nIt's champion versus champion. Power puncher versus slick striker. Australia versus New Zealand. The battle between Robert Whittaker and Israel Adesanya offers one of the most intriguing world title fights of the year, as defending champ Whittaker looks to turn back the challenge of rising star and former kickboxing ace Adesanya.\n\nBoth men are among the most exciting fighters in the UFC, and both have shown their ability to battle through octagon wars to capture (or retain) UFC gold. But who will win in Melbourne as reigning champ Whittaker faces interim belt-holder Adesanya? It should be a lot of fun finding out.\n\nTHE CO-MAIN: AL IAQUINTA VS. DAN HOOKER\n\nServing as the night's co-main event is a lightweight bout featuring two of the most entertaining strikers in the division, as New Yorker Al Iaquinta faces off against New Zealand's Dan Hooker.\n\nIaquinta pushed Khabib Nurmagomedov harder than both Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier, but still doesn't receive the full respect his skills deserve. He'll be looking to deliver a statement performance against Hooker, whose penchant for all-out battles inside the octagon \u2013 more often than not won by finish \u2013 has made him one of the most exciting fighters in the UFC today.\n\nVictory for either man should pitch them into a contender fight against one of the division's established top men, where another win could propel them to within touching distance of a shot at Khabib and his 155-pound title.\n\nTAI TUIVASA VS. SERGEY SPIVAK\n\nHard-hitting, shoey-drinking, expletive-dropping Aussie heavyweight Tai Tuivasa is a firm favorite with fans both in Australia and across the world.\n\nHe'll look to showcase his heavy-handed punch power once again when he takes on Ukrainian heavyweight Sergey Spivak. If he does, you can bet it'll be by knockout, and it'll be followed by the downing of the most disgusting post-fight drink of all, his iconic \"Shoey\", a beer chugged from the shoe, or boot, of a member of the crowd.\n\nJUSTIN TAFA VS. YORGAN DE CASTRO\n\nWhile Tuivasa is well established in the UFC as one of Australia's biggest-hitting heavyweights, another man capable of delivering some serious thunder from Down Under is former rugby player-turned-MMA fighter Justin Tafa.\n\nA proteg\u00e9 of the great Mark Hunt and teammate of Aussie favorites Tuivasa and Tyson Pedro, Tafa has been handed his UFC debut after just three pro bouts, and has been given the honor of competing in the first bout of the pay-per-view main card.\n\nHe takes on Contender Series graduate Yorgan De Castro, who will be looking to make a statement of his own on his UFC debut. But all eyes will be on Tafa, whose easy-going manner and heavy hands look set to explode on the big stage on Saturday night.", "description": "The UFC octagon heads to Australia for a huge pay-per-view show at Marvel Stadium as MMA stars Robert Whittaker and Israel Adesanya look to unify the UFC middleweight title in the biggest fight in the region's history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9636ba85f5403395129e16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
