He had won the Premier League, he had won cups. His whole ambition was to win the Champions League and he felt that he would have a better opportunity to win it at Liverpool.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe decision is perhaps surprising, given that at the time it had been a decade since Liverpool last won the Champions League, and they'd been knocked out of the competition at the group stages the season before.\n\nLiverpool also suffered a dismal campaign in the league, finishing sixth, despite challenging for the title the year previous.\n\nRodgers was then relived of his duties at the club in October of that year, just months after Milner had signed.\n\n(Image: Liverpool Echo)\n\nBut Milner's decision was justified when Rodgers' successor Jurgen Klopp led the team to European glory in June, with the veteran playing a pivotal role in the triumph.\n\n\"When we got the call to say he was going to come, I was so happy,\" Rodgers said. \"His professionalism, his intensity, his focus. It was always going to help the squad.\n\n\"Even though it was only a short time we worked together, he was always going to be a really good signing.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cHe was brilliant. Then you see what he has done. He has played at left-back, he has played in midfield. He is just a top class professional and he has done absolutely brilliant for the club.\"\n\nHis old manager was on the receiving end of Milner's talents on Saturday though, as he showed nerves of steel to tuck away a last-minute penalty to earn Liverpool a crucial win over Rodgers' Leicester .\n\nThe Reds now top the table with maximum points from eight games, and an eight-point lead over Milner's old club Man City.", "description": "Milner signed for the Reds on a free transfer in 2015 after being tempted into a move to Merseyside", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Reuters", "Liverpool Echo", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528670.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Champions-League-Final-Tottenham-Hotspur-v-Liverpool.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
