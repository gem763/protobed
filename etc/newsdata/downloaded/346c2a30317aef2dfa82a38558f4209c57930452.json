Many don\u2019t live there.\n\n\u201cNew York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., are the financial, entertainment and political capitals of the United States \u2014 and that may help explain why they are home to a disproportionately large share of the nation\u2019s newsroom employees,\u201d says a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data covering the period from 2013 to 2017. \u201cAbout one-in-five newsroom employees (22%) live in these three metro areas, which, by comparison, are home to 13% of all U.S. workers.\u201d\n\nThe trend also affects regions. The data revealed that the greatest proportion of newsroom employees \u2014 particularly online journalists \u2014 live in the Northeast.\n\n\u201cAmong the 10 largest U.S. metro areas by total population, only New York and Washington are home to larger shares of the nation\u2019s newsroom employees than of U.S. workers,\u201d the pollsters says. \u201cNewsroom employees are about twice as likely as workers overall to live in New York (12% vs. 7%) and Washington (5% vs. 2%). Los Angeles has about the same share of each (5% of the nation\u2019s newsroom employees vs. 4% of all U.S. workers).\n\n\u201cThe remaining seven metro areas \u2014 Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia and Houston \u2014 each have between 1% and 3% of both newsroom employees and U.S. workers overall,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThese 10 areas combined account for about 35% of all newsroom employees in the U.S., but about 28% of workers overall.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
