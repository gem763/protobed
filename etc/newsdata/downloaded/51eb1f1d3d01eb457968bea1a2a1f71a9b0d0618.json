That was the maximum amount on offer for the action and less than the $80.35 billion in bids it received. The last time such an overnight offering was fully subscribed was Sept. 25.\n\nThe rate on overnight general collateral repo was around 2.15% on Wednesday morning in New York, according to ICAP data. That\u2019s above the range of 1.75%-2.00% that the central bank currently maintains for the federal funds rate, a separate short-term benchmark that it targets for monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThis tells you there\u2019s some residual stress in the market and the problem is not fixed,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. \u201cThis is why the Fed is so keen to start bill purchases and very keen to continue repo operations.\u201d\n\nOvernight repo rates were also above 2% the previous day, climbing to around 2.28% on Tuesday afternoon as the additional collateral in the market generated by settlements of recent Treasury auctions increased pressure. An unwinding of trading positions in the wake of a three-day weekend for the U.S. bond market may also have had an impact.\n\nThe increase in repo rates comes even as the central bank continues with the various repo operations that it\u2019s been conducting since Sept. 17, although they remain well below the record levels reached last month that prompted the Fed to step in in the first place. The episode back then saw the rate on overnight repos jump to around 10%, but it subsequently moved back to more normal levels below 2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s next term repo operation is scheduled to take place Thursday.\n\nThe central bank is also scheduled to begin buying Treasury bills from Wednesday as part of its effort to improve its control over short-term rates, having announced the $60-billion-a-month plan last week.\n\n\u201cThe Fed hasn\u2019t fixed the underlying causes, only the symptoms,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cToday they\u2019ll start fixing the causes.\u201d\n\n(Adds analyst comment.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alexandra Harris in New York at aharris48@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Debarati Roy\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Signs of pressure in dollar funding markets are reappearing, with rates for repurchase agreements at elevated levels and the Federal Reserve\u2019s overnight operation coming in fully subscribed for the first time in three weeks.The New York Fed took $75 billion of securities in its overnight", "authors": ["Alexandra Harris"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
