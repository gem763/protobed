GRA/\n\nIn addition to setting aside more funds to prop up the industry, Morrison said his government will also lower eligibility standards so more farmers can get access to the previously committed A$7 billion in aid.\n\n\"This isn't welfare. This is really just helping people make sure that they can maintain viability,\" Morrison told reporters in Dalby, 208 km (129 miles) west of Brisbane - the state capital of Queensland.\n\n\"These are important assets for our country, our farming assets, lands they can remain productive so they can stay on the land is important to Australia.\"\n\nMorrison said A$33 million, from the A$100 million, will be set aside to provide cash-strapped farmers, contractors and families with emergency payments of up to A$3,000 each.\n\nThe government estimates there are about 24,000 farmers who would qualify for the payments.\n\nAnother A$50 million will be allocated to expand a scheme that pays drought-stricken farmers income support every fortnight.\n\nMorrison said the remaining capital will be used to expand services such as mental health counselling.\n\n($1 = 1.4806 Australian dollars)", "description": "Australia pledges $68 mln more in aid to drought-stricken farmers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
