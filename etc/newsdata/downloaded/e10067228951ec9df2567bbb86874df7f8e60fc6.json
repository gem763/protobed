But...if that is the final proposal, there will be no deal,\u201d Coveney told parliament.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said the bloc remained fully united behind Ireland.\n\n\u201cWe remain open but still unconvinced,\u201d Tusk said. After speaking to Varadkar, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the proposal had a number of problematic issues.\n\nJohnson made what his office said was his final Brexit pitch to the EU on Wednesday, offering a possible compromise on the most contentious issue that initially drew a cautious welcome by the EU.\n\nJohnson went further than many expected on trying to solve the dilemma over the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - with a proposal for an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods. This would replace the so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement he says he cannot accept.\n\nBesides the concession, however, Johnson proposed giving Northern Ireland\u2019s institutions the ongoing power to abide by or exit the regulatory zone - a possible step too far for Ireland and the EU.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies poured scorn on their Irish neighbors for their negative reaction to Johnson\u2019s offer and said their stance paved the way for a no-deal exit.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives at Downing Street in London, Britain October 3, 2019.

And it erects a hard border on the island of Ireland,\u201d said a senior EU official, saying the plan \u201ccan\u2019t fly\u201d as it stands.\n\nAn EU diplomat said the plan would need to be fundamentally reworked to become acceptable. Time was short before EU leaders meet in Brussels on Oct. 17 and 18 for a make-or-break Brexit summit, the person said.\n\nAmid so much pessimism about the possibility of a deal in just weeks, many diplomats say a phoney struggle is underway between London and Brussels to apportion responsibility for any failure.\n\nJohnson, who has also tried unsuccessfully to hold an election, says he wants to strike a deal at the EU summit. But a law passed by his opponents in parliament forces him to delay Brexit unless he strikes a deal, something he says is \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nWhile the divorce accord struck by Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, was rejected three times by the British parliament, Johnson received cautious support on Thursday from many of the pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers who helped defeat May\u2019s deal.\n\nSteve Baker, the head of the influential eurosceptic European Research Group of Conservatives, described the government\u2019s proposals as \u201cthe possibility of a tolerable deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile as I stand here today we are some way from a resolution, it is to the credit of our European friends that they have accepted the need to address these issues,\u201d Johnson told parliament.\n\n\u201cWe have made a genuine attempt to bridge the chasm, to reconcile the apparently irreconcilable. And to go the extra mile as time runs short.\u201d", "description": "The European Union and Ireland said on Thursday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals were unlikely to yield a deal, with Dublin bluntly warning that Britain was heading toward a no-deal exit unless it made more concessions.", "authors": ["Conor Humphries", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436775993&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921PQ"}
