'I cannot tell you categorically now under what circumstances we will do extra things, including ... calling on the central government to help,' she said. Last week, Lam invoked emergency powers to outlaw face masks, but the move inflamed demonstrations over the weekend and thousands took to the streets wearing masks in defiance. Lam insisted it was too early to say whether the mask ban was ineffective and urged youths not to participate in what she called political actions\n\n\n\n", "description": "Hong Kong's embattled leader\u00a0Carrie\u00a0Lam says city authorities should tackle the ongoing protests on their own, but refuses to rule out asking the Chinese government for help", "authors": ["Source"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed21abdd370fbfde12ce1ee68bb341f69ba2ffc6/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b17cb00fb98fc73701e089eaf0764fe3", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
