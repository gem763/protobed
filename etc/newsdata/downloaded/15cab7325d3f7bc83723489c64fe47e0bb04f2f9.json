also in the East - in which two people were shot dead near a synagogue.\n\nAfter the attack, Germany's anti-Semitism commissioner Felix Klein warned that the AfD had trafficked in incendiary anti-Jewish sentiment.\n\nMr H\u00f6cke is a particularly divisive character and AfD party bosses had been urged to cut him loose before Sunday's election.\n\nThe 47-year-old has previously described the Holocaust Memorial in the heart of Berlin as a 'monument of shame'.\n\nHe has also called for a '180-degree shift' in the way Germany handles remembrance of its past.\n\nWinner: Bodo Ramelow, leader of the left-wing Die Linke party, will remain state premier of Thuringia after his party came first in Sunday's election\n\nDuring the campaign he stormed out of an interview after a TV presenter compared his rhetoric to Hitler's.\n\nAs part of the programme, several AfD politicians were asked to guess whether a particular quote had come from Hitler or H\u00f6cke - and some guessed wrongly.\n\nThe result also deals a major blow to the CDU and to party chair Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is hoping to succeed Angela Merkel in the top job.\n\nMrs Merkel has promised to quit by 2021 but her party colleague has struggled to establish herself as party leader.\n\nYesterday the CDU won just 22 per cent of the vote, down from 34 per cent five years ago, as the AfD more than doubled its own performance.\n\nThe election was won by Die Linke with 31 per cent, a left-wing party popular in the East which had its origins in the Communist party that ruled until 1989.\n\nThe party's regional leader Bodo Ramelow will continue as state premier but will have to open coalition talks with other parties.\n\nThe centre-left SPD, Mrs Merkel's coalition partner in Berlin, also had a bad night, dropping to just eight per cent of the vote.\n\nThe Green party and liberal FDP both won just over five per cent, the threshold required to enter a state or national parliament in Germany.", "description": "Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke's party surged to 23 per cent of the vote in Thuringia, a state in the former East Germany, beating Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling CDU into third place.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20285144-0-image-a-10_1572276292531.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
