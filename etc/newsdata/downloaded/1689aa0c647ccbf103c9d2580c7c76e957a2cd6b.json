We are unsure if we will be able to fly. Although it's Atol-protected I have booked three weeks' leave from work and there's no guarantee that I will be able to get time off if I had to rebook.\"\n\n\"We've had constant questions from our family that we are unable to answer,\" she added. \"This is causing great concern, worry and stress to all of us involved.\"\n\nMounting difficulties\n\nThomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun.\n\nIn July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed \u00a3900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of \u00a3150m. The \u00a3900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors.\n\nThe group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional \u00a3200m on top of the \u00a3900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to \u00a31.1bn.\n\nThomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional \u00a3200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out.\n\nThe firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.\n\nWhat are your rights?\n\nIf you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).\n\nThe scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.\n\nAtol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.\n\nIf you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme.\n\nIf you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.\n\nWhen Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.\n\nHere is more information on Atol protection and Your questions answered\n\nAre you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?
