The six men and one woman were shot just before 7 a.m. inside a building in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.\n\nA sign on the building where the bloodshed occurred says Triple A Aces. Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said there was \"evidence of gambling\" including cards and dice inside.\n\nThe gambling operation was unlicensed but police had not previously received any complaints about the location, Chief of Patrol Rodney Harrison said.\n\nShea said four men were dead at the scene and the others were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not life-threatening. The victims, who have not been identified, ranged in age from 32 to 49, Shea said at a briefing near the shooting. Two may have lived out of state and the rest were from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn, Shea added.\n\nOne additional person was injured fleeing. Police said earlier that five were wounded.\n\nNo arrests have been made, and police do not know the motive for the shootings, Shea said. He said two guns were found at the scene and more could potentially be found. It is estimated that 15 shots were fired.\n\nCrime scene tape surrounded the building Saturday morning and investigators in white jumpsuits could be seen going in and out.\n\nThe block where the shots rang out has empty storefronts and boarded-up buildings as well as renovated townhouses.", "description": "A sign on the building where the bloodshed occurred says Triple A Aces", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/12/9ed952f0-91ca-49bc-9cc2-08ee7d680ee0/thumbnail/1200x630/f173364fa526e0d268352bc51e5c1e26/brooklyn.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
