It has been growing rapidly, too\u2014between 2013 and 2016, both the industry\u2019s value and employment figures grew by 20%.\n\nFor some time, economic data on the green economy in many countries has been lacking. In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics stopped measuring jobs in the green economy in March 2013 due to budget cuts. This meant that US politicians were not able to make informed decisions about the relative merits of supporting green industry or backing fossil fuels\u2014as Trump had pledged to do during his 2016 campaign.\n\nTo fill this knowledge gap, we analyzed massive databases to record the latest available business transactions from every country in the world. We estimated sales revenue and employment figures across 24 economic sub-sectors covering renewable energy, environmental protection, and low-carbon goods and services\u2014collectively termed the green economy. We used this same standardized method across all countries, allowing us to make meaningful comparisons between them.\n\nOur study estimates that revenue in the global green economy was $7.87 trillion in 2016. At $1.3 trillion, the US made up 16.5% of the global market\u2014the largest in the world.\n\nOur analysis also suggests that in the US, nearly ten times more people were employed in the green economy and its supply chains (9.5 million) than employed directly in the fossil fuel industry (roughly 1 million)\u2014that is, miners, electricity grid workers, infrastructure manufacturers, and construction workers. This wide gap comes despite the US fossil fuel industry receiving huge subsidies, estimated at $649 billion in 2015 alone.\n\nAmerica first?\n\nImportantly, the green economy has been growing faster than Trump\u2019s wildest dreams for the fossil fuel industry. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump set out his \u201cAmerica first\u201d energy policy, promising to add 400,000 new jobs to the fossil fuel industry. During the campaign, he suggested that he could increase the industry\u2019s economic output by $700 billion over 30 years.\n\nOur data indicates that the green economy grew by over $60 billion per year in 2013 and 2016. This dwarfs Trump\u2019s best hopes for growth in the fossil fuel industry, hopes that equate to an annual increase in value of $23 billion.\n\nEmployment in the US green economy also grew by the equivalent of 1.5 million full-time jobs during this time, whereas coal mining jobs declined by 37,000 over the same period.\n\nA precarious position\n\nThese are strong numbers. But after three years of faltering support, the US\u2019 position as a world leader in the green economy is precarious. Up to now, Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric has not been backed up by major policy changes, although his rollback of a number of Obama-era regulations has likely helped the fossil fuel industry in the short term. But unlike Trump, competing superpowers are strongly backing renewables.\n\nChina, for example, has emerged as a global climate leader in the wake of Trump\u2019s determination to pull out of the Paris Agreement. In 2017, it announced plans to invest $361 billion in clean energy by 2020 to generate 13 million jobs. This investment alone could go a long way to closing the gap between the value of the US\u2019 green economy and that of China\u2019s, the second largest in the world. Other countries are also poised to overtake the US in the race to shape the global green economy.\n\nThe Green New Deal\u2014popularized by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others\u2014is an ambitious policy agenda that could reestablish the US\u2019 commitment to the green economy. It proposes massive investment in renewable energy and an environment-friendly public works program of gargantuan scale. Phasing out direct fossil fuel subsides could free up some of the funding required for such investment.\n\nIt\u2019s not for us to say whether the Green New Deal is right for the US. But what our data does say loud and clear is this: if you want a strong economy that supports thousands of new jobs, then supporting its green quarters is essential. And of course, it will help our imperiled planet, too.\n\nLucien Georgeson, researcher, Green Economy and Sustainable Development, UCL and Mark Maslin, professor of Earth System Science, UCL.
