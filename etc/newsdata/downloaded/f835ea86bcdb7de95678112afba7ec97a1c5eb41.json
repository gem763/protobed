He entered Tuesday having missed every 3-point shot he had taken.\n\nSimmons splashed the trey at the end of the first half during the 144-85 thumping of the Long-Lions Tuesday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The 76ers guard dribbled above the 3-point arc as the final seconds ticked off the clock in the first half. He was given a ton of cushion by the defense as he scanned the floor.\n\nSimmons bounced the ball two more times before pulling up from the right side and swished the long-distance attempt, giving the 76ers a 79-41 lead at the break. It was his only three-point attempt of the night.\n\n\u201cThe time went down and I had the ball in my hand so I had to take a shot,\u201d Simmons told reporters.\n\nThe 2018-2019 All-Star and No. 1 overall selection in the 2017 NBA Draft scored a team-high 21 points and recorded eight rebounds and seven assists in the win. Andrew Nicholson scored a game-high 36 points for the Long Lions.\n\n\u201cI think the whole thing [Simmons not making a 3-pointer] is so overblown,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cIn general, the attention is so inflated.\u201d\n\nThe 76ers face the Charlotte Hornets in another preseason game at 7:30 p.m. EDT Friday at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem, N.C.", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers point guard Ben Simmons pulled up and made the first 3-point shot of his career Tuesday night during a preseason", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
