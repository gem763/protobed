The age of 18 is widely recognised as the age at which one becomes an adult. Full citizenship rights - from drinking to smoking to voting - should be gained at adulthood.\n\n\"What is vital is that we educate people from a younger age about democracy and give them the confidence and enthusiasm to participate when they are 18.\"\n\nWho could benefit?\n\nEven if 16-year-olds can't vote in the upcoming general election, with the support of Labour, Lib Dems and the SNP, it doesn't mean it might not happen in future.\n\nThe BBC's Political Research Unit tells Newsbeat: \"There is not any conclusive polling but based off other consistent polling, 18-24 year-olds are more likely to support Labour, the Greens and the SNP so it's a fair assumption to say this would be the case for 16 and 17-year-olds.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Liz Truss thinks PM Boris Johnson can inspire youth voters\n\nBut Liz Truss - the International Trade Secretary - told Newsbeat during the Conservative Party Conference in September that her party can bring \"young people on board\".\n\nShe says the Conservatives believe \"that people should be in control of their own lives and future\" - which will resonate with younger voters.\n\n\"The next generation coming through don't like being told what to do.\"\n\n\"They want to make up their own minds. They want to decide their own future.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "With an election close, there's not enough time or political support to give 16-year-olds the vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1835C/production/_109446199_gettyimages-493729466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
