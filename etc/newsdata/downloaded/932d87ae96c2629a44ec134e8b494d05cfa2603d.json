Holtz from its practice squad and waived wideout Robert Davis.\n\nReed was a limited participant in practice this week, but has yet to clear concussion protocol. The 29-year-old suffered the head injury, at least the sixth of his career, in Washington\u2019s preseason game against the Falcons after a helmet-to-helmet hit with safety Keanu Neal. Neal was fined for the collision.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been taking tests,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said Thursday. \u201cNow it\u2019s just a matter of how he does on though tests and then how he feels at night sleeping, in the morning when he wakes up and when he goes through the drills. Then he continues to pass the test and continues to progress then they\u2019ll allow him back on the field.\n\n\u201cUntil then, we\u2019re going to wait and make sure he\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nReed was previously listed as questionable on Friday before being downgraded to out.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
