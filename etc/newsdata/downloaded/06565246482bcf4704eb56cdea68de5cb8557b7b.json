REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nRetail sales, however, expanded at a faster-than-expected pace, signalling strength in private spending ahead of October\u2019s nationwide sales tax increase.\n\nIndustrial output fell 1.2% in August, government data showed, dropping at a faster pace than a median market forecast for a 0.5% decline and almost completely reversing July\u2019s 1.3% increase.\n\nOutput was weighed down by reduced production of iron and steel products, factory production equipment and cars, offsetting a gain in electronic parts and chemicals, the data showed.\n\nManufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to rise 1.9% in September, but fall 0.5% in October.\n\nMonday\u2019s output data paints a bleak picture for Japan\u2019s export-reliant economy, underlining broadening stress across the manufacturing sector from slowing global growth, though service-sector activity remains firm as it is less at risk from weakness in global trade.\n\n\u201cThe lack of export growth because of the global economic slowdown is having a major impact,\u201d said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. \u201cThe sales tax will be raised in October, so the deceleration of the economy will likely become stronger.\u201d\n\nThe ministry cut its assessment of activity on the whole, saying it has been somewhat weakening recently.\n\nThe world\u2019s third-largest economy has so far avoided buckling under a slowdown in overseas demand, growing for the third straight quarter in April-June, largely thanks to robust household consumption and public works spending.\n\nThe latest data showed Japan\u2019s exports slipped for a ninth month in August as the Sino-U.S. trade war hit demand from China and other Asian trading partners. Exports in volume terms, which strips away the exchange rate impact, also fell.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, however, has brought Japanese exporters some relief after signing a limited trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to cut tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products.\n\nAlthough the agreement does not cover autos, Abe said he had received assurances from Trump that Washington would not impose previously threatened \u201cSection 232\u201d national security tariffs on Japanese car imports.\n\nStill, even as the threat of higher U.S. tariffs on Japanese car imports was staved off, policymakers remain worried about the darkening outlook for the economy in light of frail external demand and global recession risks.\n\nThis month, the Bank of Japan signalled the chance of expanding stimulus as early as its October policy meeting by stepping up its rhetoric against threats to the economy from heightened overseas risks.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker cycles near a factory at the Keihin industrial zone in Kawasaki, Japan February 28, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nAn upbeat sign in August factory output came from electronic parts production, which expanded for a second straight month, suggesting the global IT cycle could be coming closer to bottoming out, said Shinkin\u2019s Tsunoda.\n\n\u201cIt usually expands for two to three years before getting worse for a year, and it has been contracting since around the fall of last year,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparate data on Monday showed domestic demand might be stronger than thought, as retail sales climbed 2% in August from a year earlier, reflecting robust spending ahead of a sales tax increase to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1.
