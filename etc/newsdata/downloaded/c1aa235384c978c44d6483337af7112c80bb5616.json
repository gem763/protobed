He\u2019s even added China to the list of foreign powers he wants to provide opposition research on the Democratic front runner.\n\n\n\nWorse, newly revealed texts between American diplomats show that senior State Department officials believed that Trump was conditioning U.S. aid to the long-beleaguered former Soviet republic on the provision of anti-Biden goodies.\n\n\n\nBut in potentially the worst development so far, it is now alleged that Trump\u2019s personal defense attorney was dangling the promise of an official diplomatic visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president in exchange for a public statement from the Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden and his family\u2019s business dealings in Kyiv.\n\n\n\nTeam Trump is having some success in deflecting attention, discrediting the California Democrat in charge of the House Intelligence Committee (who\u2019s doing a pretty good job of discrediting himself) and bringing increased attention to the younger Biden\u2019s super-swampy business model.\n\n\n\nBut the damage is already done. Trump has admitted that the central allegations are true. He has been and is using his office for his own political advantage. All presidents do in more innocuous ways \u2014 Air Force One as campaign prop, \u201cofficial\u201d events as rallies, the White House as an extension of the campaign \u2014 but dragging diplomats and involving one of the most potentially dangerous parts of the globe is new.\n\n\n\nFor Trump loyalists who are in the shoot-\u2018em-on-Fifth-Avenue club, this is not a problem. They agree with the president that his conduct was \u201cperfect.\u201d They are also convinced that Trump\u2019s predecessor did as bad or worse but was protected by the media. But for those who are not acolytes of Trumpism, including the persuadable voters he desperately needs to win back for re-election, this is turning toxic.\n\n\n\nAdd in news of an increasingly slouchy economy and you have perhaps the worst political run for this administration yet.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s likely that Trump would ever be removed by the Republican-held Senate. The idea that 20 Republican senators would join Democrats in ousting Trump still sounds laughable.\n\n\n\nBut the president is certainly not helping his cause with a scorched earth strategy that provides no shelter for his less-fanatically-devoted allies.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s stance is that he did nothing wrong \u2014 again \u201cperfect\u201d \u2014 and that anyone who says so is part of the cabal trying to drive him from office.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not going to cut it for lawmakers, especially for vulnerable Senate Republicans, as the 2020 election approaches. They need a space in between: Denunciation of dragging other countries into American politics while still saying Trump\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t merit removal from office.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s team in 1998 knew they had to give Democrats a chance to denounce the president\u2019s scuzzy behavior. Those denunciations actually strengthened Clinton\u2019s standing in the Senate and with voters. He was being punished, formally and informally, and so wasn\u2019t getting away with it. It helped turn him into a sympathetic figure.\n\n\n\nTrump and his party are right now a long way from anything like that.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: SERIOUS STUFF\n\n\u201cThere is hardly any part of the system which could have been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it than [the executive department]; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed against with less candor or criticised with less judgment.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 67\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: BON APP\u00c9TIT, Y\u2019ALL\n\nGarden&Gun: \u201cNearly any Southerner who grew up in the country\u2014whether on one acre or ten thousand\u2014has seen the damage feral hogs do, trampling and uprooting crops and native plants alike. Raised in a North Texas cattle-ranching family, Taylor Hall experienced firsthand the destruction\u2014and one potential solution. \u2018Some of the cowboys I worked with would kill them for pig roasts, gumbo, and so forth,\u2019 he says. \u2026 Hall kicked around California kitchens before returning home to open his own restaurant, Apis, in the hills outside Austin. A must for his menu: wild pig. \u2026 Hall compares the meat with beef. \u2018It\u2019s a lot darker because it\u2019s an animal that moves around a lot, so there\u2019s more blood in its muscles. And with that, you\u2019re going to get more of that iron-y, metallic flavor.\u2019 At Apis, Hall cures the meat for charcuterie and grinds it to make a traditional, slow-cooked Italian rag\u00f9, a.k.a. Sunday gravy.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\n\nBiden: 26.8 points (\u2193 0.8 points from last wk.)\n\nWarren: 22.8 points (\u2191 2 points from last wk.)\n\nSanders: 16 points (no change from last wk.)\n\nHarris: 5.6 points (\u2193 1 point from last wk.)\n\nButtigieg: 6 points (\u2191 0.6 points from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University, Fox News, NBC News/WSJ and CNN.]\n\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\n\nAverage approval: 42.2 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 53.2 percent\n\nNet Score: -11 percent\n\nChange from one week ago: no change\n\n[Average includes: CNBC: 37% approve - 53% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; Fox News: 45% approve - 54% disapprove; NBC News/WSJ: 45% approve - 53% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign said Friday that it raised $24.6 million in the third quarter and has $25.7 million cash on hand, further solidifying her rise to the top tier in the Democratic primary. The haul bests the $19 million Warren raised last quarter but trails progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose third-quarter total of $25.3 million is the biggest one so far from the Democratic presidential hopefuls. Despite neither candidate holding traditional high-dollar fundraisers, Warren and Sanders both significantly outraised former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), former Vice President Joe Biden ($15.2 million) and Sen. Kamala Harris ($11.6 million). Warren\u2019s team was alone among those campaigns to disclose its exact cash on hand. \u2026 [Campaign manager Roger] Lau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.\u201d\n\n\n\nDem front-runners\u2019 ages show larger issue for party - Politico: \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 hospitalization with a blocked artery this week finally forced the Democratic Party to confront a lingering fact: All three of its presidential front-runners are septuagenarians, and two are older than Donald Trump\u2026 For Sanders, the immediate effect of the incident \u2014 a blockage requiring two stents \u2014 was to sideline the 78-year-old senator until further notice\u2026 But the broader implications were also thrust into plain view: In a Democratic primary that was once expected to break along generational lines, a whole crop of younger contenders has fallen so far back that \u2014 even with an aging, top-tier contender laid up \u2014 it would take an upset for the party to mount a generational argument against Trump next year. Biden, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 the youngest of the three at 70 \u2014 are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate\u2019s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit. Instead, it is Sanders\u2019 friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.\u201d\n\n\n\nHarris struggles to gain ground in home state - LAT: \u201cWhen Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid, she counted California as a major asset. \u2026 But rather than serving as a foundation, California is exposing the cracks in her troubled campaign. Recent polling shows Harris mired in a distant fourth place, with support from fewer than 1 in 10 of those surveyed. \u2026 In part, the poor standing reflects problems that have plagued Harris nationwide: uneven debate performances, a shifting stance on issues and, perhaps above all, the lack of a clear and compelling message. But part of the explanation is California itself. The state is physically immense\u2026 It\u2019s also astronomically expensive to advertise, and that makes it exceedingly difficult for a politician \u2014 even one elected three times to statewide office like Harris \u2014 to become well known, much less revered. In short, as other presidential hopefuls have painfully learned, there is no such thing in California as a home-state advantage.\u201d\n\n\n\nWalter Shapiro: Pete Buttigieg\u2019s undeniable allure - New Republic: \u201cFour months before the Iowa caucuses, it is time to reckon with the reality that Buttigieg probably has a better chance to be the Democratic nominee than anyone aside from Biden and the surging Warren. With Sanders ailing and Kamala Harris sputtering, Buttigieg has enough money to go the distance (he has raised $44 million in the last six months) and enough polling support to guarantee his place on every debate stage. Whatever happens next, this youthful candidate with a long resume (Harvard, Rhodes Scholar, McKinsey analyst, failed statewide candidate, mayor, and intelligence officer in Afghanistan) has already emerged as the political surprise of 2019. And that raises a new question: Is Buttigieg, who would be four years younger than JFK if he were inaugurated in 2021, ready for the White House?\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nRick Perry expected to resign in November - Politico\n\n\n\nSupreme Court agrees to review Louisiana abortion case - Fox News\n\n\n\nFormer Rep.

In this case, her 7-year-old German Shepherd-Labrador Retriever mix Jake. \u2026 Further investigation, however, revealed the culprit. \u2018I started walking around my house and found little piles of chicken poo,\u2019 McCormick said. \u2026 The next morning \u2026 McCormick was able to witness the hen\u2019s antics first hand. \u2018I was awake and the back door was open and before I knew it, I could hear a chicken walking up the stairs in my house,\u2019 she said. \u2026 The entire process took around 15 minutes, McCormick said, since the chicken took the time to arrange the blankets and pillows into a sort of nest into which she laid the egg.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cRepose presupposes a fantasy world in which stability is self-sustaining without the United States. It is not. We would incur not respite but chaos.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the National Review on Dec. 2, 2016.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.
