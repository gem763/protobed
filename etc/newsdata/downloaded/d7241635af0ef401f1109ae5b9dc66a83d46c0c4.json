For the study, Fahs spoke with 18 women who believed they had experienced menstrual synchrony, and a few key themes repeatedly came up.\n\nFahs wrote that some of the women she interviewed believed \u201cthat menstrual synchrony happens because of biological, animal-like, or hormonal reasons\u201d\u2014in other words, that it was a natural, primal phenomenon programmed into humans to promote the survival of the species. Other women in Fahs\u2019s study believed that menstrual synchrony was real and simply transcended scientific explanation. Some, she wrote, even likened it to a mystical, invisible connection between two women.\n\nFahs also found that some women believed that when a group of female friends spent significant time together, their periods all synced to one particular woman\u2019s cycle, sensing her \u201cdominant or \u2018alpha\u2019 status\u201d and adjusting accordingly, like heliotropic flowers turning toward the sun. This idea \u201cseems really outlandish to me\u2014but it also fits with the ways that we think about group settings and social dynamics,\u201d Fahs told me. \u201cWe\u2019re a culture that really does think about things like dominance and hierarchy and social groups a lot.\u201d\n\nWhat Fahs views as the main takeaway from her research, however, is that the idea of suffering through periods together satisfies an appetite for community among women. \u201cWomen \u2026 expressed that menstrual synchrony allowed them to express anger together with other women; anger served as a platform for solidarity as women by allowing them to be more demanding or forceful,\u201d Fahs wrote in her study.\n\nOne woman Fahs interviewed spoke fondly of the feeling she had when she and her best friend got their periods around the same time, describing it as a sort of \u201cdon\u2019t mess with us\u201d solidarity. That feeling can be particularly empowering, Fahs noted, given that women\u2019s public expression of anger, particularly as a group, is often met with hostility or ridicule.\n\nAnother factor that enables the myth of period synchrony to remain in circulation, Fahs found, is that women are used to feeling as if the medical establishment has dismissed what they believe to be true about their own bodies. Over the past few years, for example, media outlets have been covering the widespread problem of \u201chealth-care gaslighting\u201d (physicians downplaying or trivializing women\u2019s pain or discomfort, or dismissing it as all in their heads). Similarly, women (and men) have for decades believed that hormonal birth control can cause weight gain and an imminent period can cause irritability\u2014based on firsthand experience, observations from their own lives, and some support from scientists\u2014even as a number of physicians and researchers have questioned whether these phenomena are actually real.", "description": "For decades, researchers have been poking holes in the study that introduced the concept of \u201cmenstrual synchrony.\u201d Many people believe in it anyway.", "authors": ["Ashley Fetters"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_153818492/facebook.jpg?1569340321", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
