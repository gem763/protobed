Participants were also given a questionnaire about how often they ate certain foods.\n\nThen they were followed for an average of 10 years. During that time, 377 people developed dementia.\n\nOf the 407 people with the highest level of trans fats, 104 developed dementia, an incidence rate of 29.8 per 1,000 person-years.\n\nFor people with the second-highest level of trans fats, 103 of the 407 developed dementia, for an incidence rate of 27.6 per 1,000 person years.\n\nOf the 407 people with the lowest level, 82 developed dementia, an incidence rate of 21.3 per 1,000 person-years.\n\nAfter adjusting for other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as high blood pressure , diabetes and smoking, researchers found that those in the highest group were 52 per cent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThose in the second-highest group were 74 per cent more likely to develop dementia than the lowest group, according to the findings.\n\nThe researchers also looked at which foods contributed the most to high levels of trans fats in the blood.\n\nSweet pastries were the strongest contributor, followed by margarine, sweets and caramels, croissants, non-dairy creamers, ice cream and rice crackers.\n\nDr Ninomiya added: \u201cThe World Health Organization has called for trans fats to be eliminated worldwide by 2023.\n\n\u201cThese public health efforts have the potential to help prevent dementia cases around the world, not to mention the decrease in heart disease and other conditions related to trans fats.\u201d", "description": "Fried foods like chips and doughnuts are full of trans fats - which have now been linked to a 50-75% higher chance of dementia", "authors": ["Stephen Beech", "Image", "Istockphoto", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13854124.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/11115_Potato-chips.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
