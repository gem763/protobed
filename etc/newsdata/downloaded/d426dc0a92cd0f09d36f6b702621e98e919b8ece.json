Initially, these digital investment platforms only provided access to a set of asset allocation portfolios based on a person's risk tolerance. But over the past several years, robo advisors have grown to offer clients connections to human advisors, among other services. More companies are getting into the robo landscape, with news reports that mutual fund giant Vanguard is testing the waters with its robo offering. With so many companies around, it can be hard to figure out how to choose a digital advisor. Here are a few tips on how to choose a robo advisor.\n\nKnow your goals.\n\nInvestors should think about their goals before reviewing robo advisors, says Laura Varas, CEO and founder of Hearts & Wallets, a consumer data and research firm. Some people may just need advice on selecting investments for a portfolio with only one goal in mind, while others may be saving for several goals. Once investors know what they want, they can decide if it's enough to own one investment model that has a set asset allocation and automatically rebalances to take advantage of portfolio efficiencies like tax-loss harvesting and automatic investment, or if they need a little more help to save for multiple goals at once.\n\nFacilitate goal planning.\n\nRobo advisors should offer tools and advice for investors to learn about their risk tolerance and what they need to reach their short- and long-term goals, says Mike Kerins, founder and CEO of RobustWealth, a robo advisory. \"What are they doing to help you reach your goals and how do they talk to you about reaching those goals?\" he says. In addition to risk tolerance, investors need to take into consideration their time horizon and how long they have to reach those goals. Investors should also find out how customized the portfolio will be fit their goals and time horizon.\n\nUnderstand the fees and minimums investments.\n\nRobo advisory costs and minimum investment levels vary by platform and service, Varas says. Some don't require a minimum amount to open an account, with annual account fees as low as 0.25%, which means $25 for every $10,000 invested annually. Those account fees are on top of the fees for the mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Varas says investors who don't need much human support and just want a small amount of smart portfolio management should look for the lowest management fee. She says people who want a mid-level service such as access to phone representatives or live chats may need to pay more for that option or have larger minimum balances.\n\nReview support staff credentials.\n\nGailyn Johnson, chief operating officer at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management Group, says investors who want to speak to an advisor should dig deeper into the robo advisor's support service. She recommends finding out when the support staff available: Is it only certain hours of the day or night? Are people available 24/7? If an investor wants to speak to an advisor, ask about the required training and background of the person giving advice, she says. \"Are these people licensed and able to actually talk about this and help educate you to understand what is available?\"\n\nCheck the ease of access.\n\nGreg McBride, a chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, says he's subjective for every investor. \"How well does the design appeal to you? How easy is it to use? The whole idea here is to encourage yourself to invest, and a frustrating consumer experience is going to be the opposite of that,\" he says. McBride says to start, investors should look at what type of calculators and educational information is available. They should also see if the robo advisor offers other financial services such as savings or banking capabilities. \"The landscape is evolving, so what's available today is not going to be the same as what's available six to 12 months from now,\" he says.\n\nMake sure goals are well integrated.\n\nFor people who are saving for more than one goal, make sure all those goals are integrated, Varas says. Many people with long-term goals may have plans to save for their children's college education and retirement. Best practices show that it's important that the two are done together. \"You can't say let's do retirement first, then college,\" she says. \"Investors should look for a (service) that helps them allocate their savings across these two goals, and they should get specific dollar recommendations of how much to be saving.\" Varas adds it's only been in the past few years that robo advisors are giving specific dollar amount recommendations.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Choosing a robo advisor is easier said than done.
