As the U.K. government and the Civil Aviation Authority begin a massive repatriation effort to bring home more than 150,000 British citizens stranded by Thomas Cook's sudden closure, they say they could be summoned to the airport at any moment.\n\nTo add to their troubles, most of their guests, including the best man, who were set to fly to Greece with Thomas Cook Airlines over the next few days, now have no way of traveling to the destination wedding, even if the ceremony can proceed.\n\n\"I am just devastated,\" Cook told Nottinghamshire Live. \"We have got 30-plus friends and family coming out, half are stuck at home in limbo. My best man is still in England. No one here knows anything.\"\n\n\"I have been planning this for two years, and it has all gone to pot,\" he added. \"We have paid for everything. It is shattering. We don't know what we can do. Thomas Cook promised us a surprise on our wedding because of my name, but this was not the surprise we were expecting.\"\n\nRELATED: Chaotic scenes from airports affected by the Thomas Cook collapse:", "description": "Cook, 29, and his fiancee, 27-year-old\u00a0Amelia Binch, both from Hucknall, England, have been stranded on the Greek island of Rhodes\u00a0ahead of their wedding.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T8dLVwrtfzQszQOhqrDhfg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/718x471+1+315/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/621b3880-de28-11e9-879f-cc068cba6e82", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
