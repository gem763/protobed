But there\u2019s some optimism and relief today for sure. It\u2019s inevitable, really,\u201d said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management in Sao Paulo.\n\nBrazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP rose around 1% to break above 107,000 points for the first time ever, while the real rose more than 1% to 4.07 per dollar BRBY for its biggest one-day gain in six weeks.\n\nOverhauling Brazil\u2019s costly social security system was President Jair Bolsonaro and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes\u2019s number one economic reform push for their first year in office.\n\nThe country\u2019s public finances are extremely stretched, in part because social security outlays are so high, but also because tax revenues have fallen far short of expectations because of weak growth.\n\nThe economy is on track to grow by less than 1.0% this year, lower than the previous two years and well below the 2% or more most economists, as well as the government, expected at the start of the year.\n\nThe government\u2019s original pension reform bill envisaged savings of 1.237 trillion reais over the next decade. That was diluted to just over 900 billion reais in the lower house, then down to around 800 billion reais in the Senate.", "description": "Brazil's Senate Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee on Tuesday approved the text of a pension reform bill, paving the way for a second and final plenary vote later in the day that will finally enact the landmark bill into law.", "authors": ["Ricardo Brito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
