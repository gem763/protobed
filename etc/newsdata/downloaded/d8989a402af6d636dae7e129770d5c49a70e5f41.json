And that familiarity was key to get people across the line,\" she said.\n\nSee also: How Linux took over everything, including Microsoft Azure (TechRepublic)\n\nAt the same time, the company said hosting on Azure gives it the ability to allow customers to integrate into its Active Directory, which is used to streamline its service to customers.\n\nWhile Vapar's initial focus has been Australia, it also has global ambitions to expand to the United States and United Kingdom.\n\n\"There are pipes everywhere,\" Siqueria said.\n\nShe noted there are potential applications aside from sewer and stormwater pipes, including drinking water pipes, as well as other utility pipelines such as those for telecommunications, oil, and gas.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nCoates Hire preps for the future with three-day Azure shift\n\nThe company underwent a three-day cloud transition to Microsoft Azure, aimed at cutting costs and preparing for future transformation with a vision to include machine learning and the Internet of Things.\n\nKomatsu Australia leveraging cloud to unify data and maximise machine use\n\nKomatsu has deployed Microsoft Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, combined with Discovery Hub and Power BI, to help process its vast amount of data.\n\nWA Department of Finance moves to Microsoft Azure\n\nThe move took place after an initial nine to 12 month planning phase.\n\nASIO eyes Microsoft Azure for phase one of tech transformation\n\nSix packages are up for grabs under the spy agency's systems integration tender, with protected, secret, and top secret information to be hosted solely on Azure.", "description": "The startup has switched from Google Cloud to Microsoft Azure to meet customer expectations.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/07/e79aa536-a728-4701-a33a-84b49eaf2ec6/thumbnail/770x578/eb694ae00646c6e553fcffa0688c242c/leak-istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
