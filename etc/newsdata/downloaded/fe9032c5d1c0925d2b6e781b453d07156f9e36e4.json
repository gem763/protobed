But Turkey could not close out the game, missing four consecutive free throws in the final nine seconds.\n\nThat final miss was enough of a lifeline for the Americans to grasp, with Jayson Tatum grabbing the rebound and driving upcourt. He dished the ball to Khris Middleton, who was fouled on his shot and drained his two free throws to give Team USA its second win of the group stage.\n\nBut while the last-second heroics were a reason to celebrate, they came at a price for an already short-handed Team USA.\n\nAfter dumping the ball off to Middleton, Tatum landed oddly on his ankle and could be seen limping out of the way of the play. He would be helped off the floor with a sprained left ankle, according to ESPN's Brian Windhorst.\n\nAfter the game, the severity of Tatum's injury was unclear. He's due to be re-evaluated on Wednesday.\n\nRegardless of how severe the ankle injury is though, it is cause for concern for an American side that is already missing many of its best potential players, who have instead elected to rest up and train for the upcoming NBA season on their own.\n\nRead more: The NBA's best players are dropping out of the first Olympics qualifying event at an alarming rate\n\nTeam USA is 2-0 so far in the tournament, but as the test against Turkey proved, the team is more vulnerable to an early exit than any time in recent history.\n\nThey'll play Japan in their final game of the opening round of the tournament on Thrusday.\n\nCarli Lloyd shoots down critics who say she couldn't kick in the NFL\n\nTrack sensation Matthew Boling was used as a ringer in a race between University of Georgia football players and coaches and recreated one of his iconic finishes\n\nBronny James shouted out Steph Curry after hitting a trick shot 3-pointer from the bench during warmups\n\n23-year-old Russian tennis star Daniil Medvedev taunted a booing crowd at the US Open: 'I won because of you'", "description": "Team USA won their game in nail-biting fashion on Tuesday, but might have lost Celtics star Jayson Tatum in the process.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6e9ec02e22af3049081d84-2732-1366.jpg"}
