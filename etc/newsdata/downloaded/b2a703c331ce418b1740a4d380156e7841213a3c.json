Police confirmed that a fatal shooting took place around that time in the same location described by the Morning News but stopped short of identifying the victim as Brown.\n\nLee Merritt, a civil rights attorney who represents the Jean family, identified the victim as Brown.\n\nJason Hermus, the assistant district attorney and lead prosecutor in the Guyger case, also appeared to confirm Brown\u2019s death, telling the Morning News on Saturday that \u201che bravely came forward to testify when others wouldn't.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had more people like him, we would have a better world,\u201d Hermus was quoted as saying.\n\nPolice said several witnesses saw a silver, four-door sedan fleeing the parking lot at a high speed after the shooting. Brown was reportedly found with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nHe was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, but he died from his injuries. No suspects have been named in the case at this time.\n\nBrown was a key witness for the prosecution in Guyger\u2019s trial. Guyger, a white off-duty cop in uniform on the night of the killing, was found guilty of murder for fatally shooting Jean, an unarmed black man, in his own apartment in September 2018. Guyger said she confused Jean\u2019s apartment for her own and believed he was an intruder, shooting at him in self-defense.\n\n\u201cI thought it was my apartment,\u201d Guyger told dispatchers 19 times on the 911 call played in court. \u201cI thought it was my apartment. I\u2019m fucked. Oh my God. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nGuyger, 31, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday. She faced up to 99 years for the fatal shooting.\n\nBrown lived across the hall from 26-year-old Jean, and testified that on the night of Sept. 6, 2018, he was in the hallway on the fourth floor of the apartment building when he heard what he thought sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise.\u201d He said at the trial that he couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying before he heard two gunshots.\n\nMerritt said Brown\u2019s murder \u201cunderscores the reality of the black experience in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrown deserves the same justice he sought to ensure the Jean family,\u201d Merritt wrote on Facebook . \u201cThe Dallas County criminal justice system must mobilized to identify his killer and see that he is held accountable for this murder.\u201d", "description": "Joshua Brown was shot multiple times just days after telling a court what he heard when the former Dallas cop shot an unarmed black neighbor last year.", "authors": ["Anna Kaplan", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1144,w_2034,x_0,y_165/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570321191/RTX75EBW_nw6msy", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
