Biologically only women menstruate, to remove the female symbol is denying biology. I will no longer purchase @ProcterGamble products. \u2014 Wendy \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff (@Wendyjg1) October 20, 2019\n\n@always Genderless feminine hygiene products. Really? Only women have periods, that's a scientific fact. If your company does not understand this, how can I trust you to make a quality product? I might end up with a jock strap. #putthesymbolback #boycottalways \u2014 Kristi Hassell (@lkhassell) October 21, 2019\n\nProminent feminist writer, Julie Bindel, told The Mail on Sunday: \u201cRemoving the female symbol from sanitary towel packaging is basically denying the existence of women. We\u2019re now moving towards the total elimination of women\u2019s biology. The women\u2019s symbol has been used by feminists for decades. This is pure cowardice and virtue signalling from these big corporate brands who are capitulating to the trans agenda.\u201d\n\nMaya Forstater, a woman who was fired from her think tank job for saying that men cannot change into women, wrote: \u201cThe venus sign in biology is used to represent the female sex (you know, the ONLY people who will ever need these products). It does not represent gender identity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement after the decision, Procter & Gamble said: \u201cFor over 35 years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so. We\u2019re also committed to diversity and inclusion, and after hearing from many people across genders and age groups, we realised that not everyone who has a period and needs to use a pad identifies as female.\u201d\n\nThey added: \u201cTo ensure that anyone who needs to use a period product feels comfortable in doing so with Always, we updated our pad wrapper design. Our mission remains to ensure no girl loses confidence at puberty because of her gender or period and we do this through our puberty education programs, by providing access to period products with programs such as #EndPeriodPoverty, and by using our brand voice to tackle societal barriers and stigmas like we did with #LikeAGirl.\u201d\n\nThe two transgender activists who started the controversy have since set their Twitter accounts to private.", "description": "Women are boycotting \u2018Always\u2019 sanitary pads after the company decided to remove a female symbol after pressure from transgender activists.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/transgender-protest-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
