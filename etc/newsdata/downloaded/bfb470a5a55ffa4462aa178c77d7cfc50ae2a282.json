(Ton Gannam/AP Images for The Human Rights Campaign) (Tom Gannam/AP)\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign is signing on to support Stacey Abrams\u2019s voter protection initiative, saying LGBTQ people are part of marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected by strict voting laws.\n\nAlphonso David, president of the HRC, said the organization would make a \u201csix figure\u201d contribution, as well as committing staff and other resources to Fair Fight 2020, launched in August to combat what Democratic and liberal groups say are voter suppression efforts on the part of Republican elections officials in 20 battleground states.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that the Human Rights Campaign needs to do something meaningful in this space,\u201d David said in an interview. \u201cVoter suppression has primarily targeted voters of color, who also happen to include LGBTQ Americans, who far too often face disproportionate barriers in accessing their right to vote.\u201d\n\nThe partnership will be announced at the HRC\u2019s annual national dinner Saturday night in Washington via a video featuring Abrams and David.\n\nAbrams has focused on challenging restrictive voting laws and policies since narrowly losing a bid for governor of Georgia last year. She cited widespread irregularities in that election, including laws that suspended tens of thousands of voter registration applications, purges that kicked more than 1 million voters off the rolls, the closing of polling places and lack of uniformity for counting absentee and provisional ballots. Abrams and others decried the decision by Republican Brian Kemp to continue in his role as secretary of state, Georgia\u2019s chief elections officer, while also running for governor. He won the seat by fewer than 55,000 votes.\n\nAfter ending her campaign, Abrams formed Fair Fight, which filed a federal lawsuit asking that Georgia officials be forced to make improvements in its election system.\n\n[Stacey Abrams chooses building a national voter protection program over running for president in 2020]\n\nFair Fight 2020, which Abrams and her aides said would cost about $5 million, is offering state Democratic parties and liberal activists money and technical assistance to set up programs to identify and address potential barriers to voting, especially those affecting low-income, minority and young people.\n\nTransgender voters also could run into difficulties over strict voter ID laws, David said, especially in states that insist that a person\u2019s official documents conform to the gender assigned to them at birth.\n\n\u201cA transgender woman may be turned away from voting because she has not been able to get her name changed legally in state where she lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThese types of challenges are further compounded for LGBTQ people of color.\u201d\n\nPart of the HRC\u2019s work with Fair Fight will be doing research to \u201cunderstand how the right to vote is being suppressed for LGBTQ communities,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid said HRC approached Fair Fight with help because he admires Abrams \u2014 the group backed her gubernatorial bid \u2014 and because of her work on voting rights.\n\n\u201cI am so proud to be building a partnership with the Human Rights Campaign \u2014 because this fight is all of our fight,\u201d Abrams said in a statement. \u201cWe must make sure that LGBTQ voters and all voters across the country are able to register, to vote, and to have their vote counted \u2014 no matter who they are, what they look like or whom they love.\u201d\n\nDavid said the HRC has long been involved in voter registration efforts, including having signed up 30,000 new voters for last year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working to turn out the vote, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d David said. \u201cWe have to protect the votes when [people] show up and make sure their votes are counted after they vote.\u201d", "description": "The Human Rights Campaign says LGBTQ voters, especially those from groups disproportionately affected by strict voting laws and policies, also are vulnerable.", "authors": ["Vanessa Williams", "Reporter On The National Desk.", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PA-SJ3_lJCcBTjNbSx8ZKertRbE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCIRI5WXOMI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
