The Marines were by far the leanest with an obesity rate of only 8.3 percent.\n\nThese calcualtions are based on body mass index (BMI), \"calculated utilizing the latest height and weight record in a given year,\" according to the report. \"BMI measurements less than 12 and greater than 45 were considered erroneous and excluded.\"\n\n(The study does caution that there are limitations to using BMI: \"1. Service members with higher lean body mass may be misclassified as obese based on their BMI. 2. Not all Service members had a height or weight measurement available in the Vitals data each year. 3. BMI measures should be interpreted with caution, as some of them can be based on self-reported height and weight.)\n\nAmong the services, obesity rates were higher among males than females. They were also higher among individuals 35 and over as opposed to those in their 20s. \"The overall prevalence of obesity has increased steadily since 2014,\" the Pentagon report said.\n\nObesity is on the rise across the services, The New York Times notes, explaining that the Navy's obesity rate has increased sixfold since 2011, while the rates for the other services have more than doubled.\n\nThis trend appears linked to one prevalent in civilian society, where 30.8 percent of all adult Americans are considered obese, according to information provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRoughly 30 percent of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 are ineligible for recruitment, Army Times reported last year, noting that a third of that group are disqualified for their weight. \"Out of all the reasons that we have future soldiers disqualify, the largest \u2014 31 percent \u2014 is obesity,\" Maj. Gen. Frank Muth, head of Army Recruiting Command said last October.\n\n\"The high prevalence of obesity in the US poses a serious challenge to recruiting and retaining healthy Soldiers,\" the Army's 2018 Health of the Force report explained.\n\n\"Obesity negatively impacts physical performance and military readiness and is associated with long-term health problems such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and risk for all-cause mortality,\" the new DoD report read.", "description": "The Navy may be the most obese service, but it isn't the only branch that is getting a bit too fat to fight.
