Bottlenose dolphins sometimes swim right by, and the views of the fjord, mountains and Carretera Austral can all be seen from here. The hot springs are open all day and night, and are just a short walk on a forest trail from the main lodge area. Some longer term guests spend the majority of their days here, relaxing on sun loungers, reading or just taking in the superb views and sense of solitude while steaming away.\n\n\n\nPhoto courtesy of Dave Stamboulis", "description": "Patagonia is a breathtaking place, home to endless untouched wilderness, and the cleanest air and water left on the planet.
