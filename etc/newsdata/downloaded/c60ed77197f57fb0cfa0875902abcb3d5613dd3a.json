Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nPromising type Golden Sixty will take his first step towards a Classic Mile appearance in January at Sha Tin on Sunday, however it could be more of a giant leap if he is to perform.\n\nThe progressive four-year-old steps up in grade in the Class Two IWC Excellent Handicap (1,400m) as he looks to earn the chance to prove his credentials among some of Hong Kong\u2019s top young gallopers.\n\nThe 84-rater has been a rapid improver through the grades, winning four of his five starts in convincing fashion, but has only done his best work over 1,200m.\n\nJockey Vincent Ho Chak-yiu knows the noted backmarker needs to progress through not only the grades but further distances if he is to be competitive against the jurisdictions top four-year-olds.\n\nGolden Sixty\u2019s only foray into 1,400m racing last season stands out like a sore thumb, finishing near last after starting a $2.5 favourite \u2013 an issue which concerns Ho.\n\n\u201cGolden Sixty has been racing over 1,200m and winning so we are trying to step him up, hopefully run him in some big races,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is the second time for him over 1,400m, we expect him to be a bit better so hopefully we get him there.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get him to the Classic Mile but there is no rush, as long as he learns to relax in the run and hit the line strong then he should produce some good performances.\u201d\n\nWhat a return!

Of course it is a bit too short for him but he will run a good race. If it keeps raining, it will definitely help him.\u201d\n\nFrankie Lor Fu-chuen\u2019s Classic Cup (1,800m) hero Mission Tycoon also lines up in the race as he looks to rediscover his best form following two disappointing starts this season.\n\nCaspar Fownes will also unveil one of his premier Derby hopefuls in The Hulk.\n\nThe 85-rater is a Group Three winner in New Zealand and has been bought to make a run at the four-year-old series.", "description": "Promising type Golden Sixty will take his first step towards a Classic Mile appearance in January at Sha Tin on Sunday, however it could be more of a giant leap if he is to perform....", "authors": ["Trenton Akers", "Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/17/f9324344-efe4-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_111635.JPG?itok=FtKh_d-w&v=1571282204", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
