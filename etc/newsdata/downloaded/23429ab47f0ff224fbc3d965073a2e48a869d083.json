But the differences are more illuminating than the similarities. For one, Trump\u2019s list arose in a starkly different political context. As a candidate, the president broke with GOP orthodoxy on multiple fronts. He denounced free-trade agreements in favor of tariffs and protectionism, castigated past Republican leaders for entangling the U.S. in overseas wars, and pledged to reject cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Trump, unlike Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, wasn\u2019t a product of the conservative establishment. At one point in his life, he was a pro-choice Democrat.\n\nEven as rank-and-file GOP voters largely flocked to Trump\u2019s banner, conservative elites and donors saw danger. They had spent four decades building a movement to reshape the federal judiciary in their own image, nurturing a cadre of originalist lawyers and jurists to serve in it. Antonin Scalia\u2019s sudden death in 2016 threatened to upend that project. If Hillary Clinton had won, her nominee to replace him would have almost certainly given the court\u2019s liberals their first five-justice majority since the 1960s. And even if Trump somehow won, conservative legal figures worried that his ideological flexibility and self-professed willingness to strike deals would leave them empty-handed.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2016 shortlists amounted to a Faustian bargain of sorts between him and the conservative legal movement. In exchange for their support and influence, he would pledge to use the lists as a guide when naming future Supreme Court justices. For Trump, it was an easy deal to make. He had already promised to appoint judges in Scalia\u2019s mold and often warned his supporters of Clinton\u2019s potential nominees. In practical terms, this arrangement gave some conservatives a degree of cover when endorsing him. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who had pointedly refused to back Trump at the party\u2019s convention that summer, used the list to justify his endorsement in September.\n\nThese internal dynamics aren\u2019t really at play for liberals. There is no real fear that Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, or Bernie Sanders would name someone to Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s right to the high court if given the chance. There is also currently no Supreme Court vacancy to force the issue to the top of the national agenda. And as BuzzFeed\u2019s Zoe Tillman noted last month, there used to be a fundamental difference in how the two parties approached the subject. Democratic candidates and voters tended to focus on the issues that come before the court, such as abortion, gun control, and LGBT rights. Republicans, by comparison, typically focus on control of the courts as both an end and a means.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates are now openly weighing court-packing as a potential remedy to a Supreme Court that they increasingly view as illegitimate.\n\nThat gap is fading fast in the Trump era. Thanks to Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, there is now a reliable conservative majority on the Supreme Court for the first time in more than a half-century, and it will likely persist for at least a generation. That majority owes its existence to a fractious sequence of events: Mitch McConnell\u2019s blockade of Merrick Garland, Trump\u2019s victory despite losing the popular vote, and Kavanaugh\u2019s corrosive confirmation battle. As a result, Democratic presidential candidates are now openly weighing court-packing as a potential remedy to a Supreme Court that they increasingly view as illegitimate. (I\u2019ve previously argued against that option and proposed a healthier solution.)", "description": "A Supreme Court shortlist released on Tuesday marks the beginning of an effort to counter conservative judicial dominance.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/a9c491fadfbfc52b18beb781f1dd1fc9fb1ef386.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
