REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss anti-trust authority has approved Sunrise Communications\u2019 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.36 billion) takeover of Liberty Global\u2019s UPC business, setting up a showdown between the telecoms company and foes of the deal.\n\nSunrise \u2014 locked in a feud with its largest investor, Germany\u2019s Freenet, which opposes the deal \u2014 now plans an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Oct. 23 to vote on a capital increase needed to fund the takeover.\n\nFreenet, which owns a quarter of Sunrise, has been joined by some other investors in fighting the transaction on grounds the price is too high, a proposed 4.1 billion franc capital increase would dilute their holdings and the Swiss company would wind up with all the risks while allowing Liberty Global a lucrative and unfettered exit.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) has decided to raise no objections to the acquisition of UPC Switzerland by Sunrise, and has now approved the transaction,\u201d Sunrise said on Thursday. \u201cThe approval was granted without any conditions or stipulations being imposed.\u201d\n\nCOMCO said it expected the deal to boost competition.\n\nSunrise has been meeting investors in hopes of convincing them to support the transaction against Freenet\u2019s stiff resistance. Sunrise Chief Executive Olaf Swantee has signaled readiness to modify financing of the deal, although the details are not yet public.\n\nSunrise said COMCO\u2019s blessing was a \u201cconfirmation of its own view that the transaction will give it a significant competitive edge, thereby making it an even stronger competitor\u201d to Switzerland\u2019s dominant communications provider, state-controlled Swisscom.", "description": "The Swiss anti-trust authority has approved Sunrise Communications' 6.3 billion Swiss franc ($6.36 billion) takeover of Liberty Global's UPC business, setting up a showdown between the telecoms company and foes of the deal.", "authors": ["John Miller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434028504&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0BQ-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
