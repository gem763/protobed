REUTERS/Bobby Yip/Files\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK) on Friday lowered its expectations for full-year profit due to \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d conditions in its home market racked by anti-government protests that it expected to persist for the rest of 2019.\n\nThe airline reported a 7.1% drop in passenger numbers for the month of September as travellers avoided Hong Kong due to widespread and sometimes violent protests, and said its second-half financial results were likely to be below the first half.\n\nCathay in August reported a HK$1.347 billion ($171.75 million) first-half profit. At that time, it said second-half profit was likely to be higher than the first-half, as is typically the case for the airline, based on seasonality.\n\nThe consensus estimate before Friday\u2019s update was for the airline to report a full-year profit of HK$3.2 billion, according to 11 analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see a significant shortfall in inbound bookings for the remainder of 2019 as compared to the same snapshot last year,\u201d Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement on Friday.\n\nInbound traffic to Hong Kong was down 38% in September, unchanged from August, with demand from the mainland Chinese market hit especially hard, the airline said.\n\nThe 7.1% fall in passenger numbers in September was better than the 11.3% drop in August, but Cathay said an increasing reliance on transit passengers had affected its yields - a measure of the average fare paid per kilometre per passenger.\n\nCathay last month said it would cut capacity for the upcoming winter season.", "description": "Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <0293.HK> on Friday lowered its expectations for full-year profit due to \"incredibly challenging\" conditions in its home market racked by anti-government protests that it expected to persist for the rest of 2019.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442148699&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H09H", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
