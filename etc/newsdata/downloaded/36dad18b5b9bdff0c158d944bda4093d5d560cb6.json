He voices his contempt for VAR and celebrates his insistence on talking in Spanish to his children. Milner also reveals that he and Andy Robertson, his Liverpool teammate, have used a sleep-talking app \u2013 which proves that Milner speaks in Spanish while asleep.\n\nThese topics are addressed in an entertaining book called Ask a Footballer. The footballer in question is Milner, who has made the sixth-most appearances in Premier League history while subverting his image from being parodied as the most boring man in football to becoming one of the most interesting players in the game. Milner answers a series of open-ended questions put to him, mostly by fans, and uses the concept to expand on his distinctive career.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s beating heart Henderson is relentless in breaking Spurs | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nHis early years were very different to the path followed by pampered young footballers today. He was 16 when he made his Premier League debut for Leeds in 2002 and the character of Milner was sealed in those gritty days. \u201cHundred percent,\u201d he says. \u201cI was playing in the Premier League and still cleaning the under-18s captain\u2019s boots. I was scoring goals in the Premier League but, after the game, I\u2019m picking up the kit, taking the dirty slips to the bus with the kitman. I had to make tea on the bus. After 20 games in the Premier League, with a few goals, the kitman said: \u2018Go on, get on the bus.\u2019 That made me feel so good. But it gave me such hunger and you knew your place.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helped me and they\u2019re good values that I wish were still in the game. It would help young players. They\u2019re now looked after amazingly well but there\u2019s more scrutiny on social media. In some ways they probably have it harder than we did as kids.\u201d\n\nMilner sounds pragmatic rather than wistful when pointing out that dressing rooms are now much quieter and more sanitised. But his remorseless professionalism has not cost him his wit or honesty. He still speaks in unvarnished detail when, like here, he is relaxed during an hour-long interview and I ask him about VAR: \u201cI\u2019m not a fan at all.\u201d\n\nMilner grins when I remind him that, in his book, he says he hates VAR. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s in writing. So we\u2019ll go with that. It might just be the old school part of me but I think there\u2019s still too much debate around VAR. Goal-line technology is incredible. Instant decision. Black and white. But it\u2019s very hard to use VAR when you\u2019ve still got opinions on the decisions and the atmosphere is being ruined. You score, there\u2019s an explosion of noise and then it\u2019s VAR. You wait. Is it a goal?\n\n\u201cI had the experience of a penalty the other week [when Milner scored a much-delayed last-minute spot-kick to win the game against Leicester]. That was a new experience as they\u2019re debating if it\u2019s going to be a penalty. I think there\u2019s use for it \u2013 if we can improve it. But football is a game of human error on the field and in officiating as well. They have a very tough job and I\u2019m all for making their lives easier \u2013 but not at the expense of the flow of the game. If the VAR took away controversy I\u2019d back it 100%. But we\u2019re still having discussions about VAR. I don\u2019t think many footballers feel differently.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milner made his Premier League debut as a teenager with Leeds. Photograph: Gary M. Prior/Getty Images\n\nMilner sounds almost nostalgic for the lunacy of Phil Dowd\u2019s high-jinks as a referee when he was playing for Aston Villa. \u201cI was being pulled back by the referee and I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was at Villa Park and I was running into the box. Me and Phil Dowd were close to each other, and he pulled my shirt. I look around, and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Ref!\u2019 But, hang on a moment, it is the ref! Afterwards you think: \u2018Did that really happen?\u2019\u201d\n\nDid Dowd say much to him? \u201cYeah. We were joking about it. Strange. But it happened.\u201d\n\nMilner also confirms that J\u00fcrgen Klopp really did wear CR7 boxer shorts when making his final team talk before Liverpool faced Ronaldo and Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final. \u201cHe thinks deeply about what he\u2019s going to say before a game \u2013 and the CR7 thing broke the ice. This was just before we went to the ground for the final and we had our usual 15-minute meeting. He just lifted his top and had Cristiano\u2019s boxer shorts on. Everyone started laughing \u2013 as you would before a Champions League final against one of the best players in the world and your manager\u2019s wearing his boxer shorts. He just relaxed everyone. That\u2019s why he\u2019s such a good manager.\u201d\n\nDid Klopp say much to Milner before this year\u2019s Champions League final? Milner had started virtually every Champions League game \u2013 but he was on the bench in the final. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything. He only explained his thinking to me after the game. He said he wanted me on the field at the end. If it got nervy he wanted me playing \u2013 especially if it went to extra time or penalties. I was obviously disappointed but you win things as a squad. After a day you think: \u2018What can I do to help us win this trophy?\u2019 Anyway I came on after an hour and we won. When you get over the line it\u2019s amazing and you remember all the games you\u2019ve played \u2013 like beating Barcelona 4-0 at Anfield. Winning it was incredible.\u201d\n\nThe league now matters most to Liverpool, after a 30-year wait, and Milner acknowledges that the yearning of the fans can be intense. \u201cThey started getting quite nervous early in the title race last season. It was the first time I had sensed that atmosphere at Anfield. But nothing really changes in the dressing room. The lads are always calm and confident and hopefully winning the Champions League settles people down. I hope they can just enjoy it. As much as people want the trophy, it\u2019s the journey that you enjoy most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to win the league. I\u2019ve been fortunate to win it a couple of times [with Manchester City] and last year we were so close. We were flying. We were winning every week and felt we should be 10 points clear. And you\u2019re still second. Last year, if you\u2019d have said: \u2018You\u2019ll only lose one [league] game all season,\u2019 I\u2019d have snapped your hand off. But it wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milner\u2019s Premier League career has also taken in spells at Aston Villa, Newcastle and Manchester City. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThis season we have a team that can do it. I think there\u2019s a calm around the club, both inside and outside, and people are confident we can get it done. But City are so good they\u2019re capable of winning every game. The gap is not that big so we have to just keep pushing, and not worry too much about the title.\u201d\n\nA six-point lead seems a comfortable margin for Liverpool after 10 games, with nine wins and draw, but next weekend they face City. \u201cA couple of bad games can happen,\u201d Milner admits, \u201cand with the amount of games we\u2019re playing there might be a couple of injuries. It could be a couple of poor performances and the lead\u2019s gone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so special to win the league. It\u2019s so difficult and the best team always wins the league, no matter what. Hopefully winning that first trophy, the European Cup, as a squad will give us the experience to win the league.\u201d\n\nMilner played against United at Old Trafford \u2013 in the only game that Liverpool have dropped points so far. \u201cThey defended well and we only played our best for the last 15 minutes. It\u2019s never easy after an international break. That\u2019s no excuse but it might explain the lack of rhythm. The fight was there to the end and we got a point. You see that character in the squad time and time again. If someone\u2019s not in the gym you say: \u2018Where were you today?\u2019 That\u2019s the sort of dressing room we have. It\u2019s massive.\u201d\n\nThe best players might make a mistake once, twice maximum. But they learn from it and never do it again\n\nHigh standards also prevail in the Milner household. He nods when I ask if he is still talking to his small children in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019ll repeat things in English after I\u2019ve spoken to them in Spanish. But, yeah, always Spanish first. My daughter understands everything. My son repeats more, and doesn\u2019t understand as much. But a child\u2019s mind is incredible really. They pick up things so fast so it\u2019s the best time to do it. I got the idea because Ga\u00ebl Clichy [his former City teammate] said his daughter spoke three or four different languages. When I started to talk to the kids in Spanish my wife probably thought it would last a couple of weeks. But then again she knows me. Maybe she knew I\u2019d do it all the time.\u201d\n\nMilner did not reveal the extent of his Spanish to Lionel Messi after he had fouled him in the first leg at Barcelona last season. Messi reminded Milner of how he nutmegged him while calling him a \u201cburro\u201d \u2013 without realising the Yorkshireman understood it meant donkey in English. \u201cI just smiled and went back to the dressing room. We weren\u2019t in the best position then. But Messi\u2019s incredible. I\u2019m lucky to have played against him and Ronaldo because the numbers they put up every year are ridiculous.\u201d\n\nYet Milner says that Wilfried Zaha is the player against whom he has had the most difficulty. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent off for tackles on him twice. He\u2019s a talent. Unpredictable. You see how difficult it is to deal with him when you\u2019re watching him. And when you play against Zaha he\u2019s tricky and very tough to face.\u201d\n\nLast week Patrice Evra said the same about Milner when naming him as the player against whom he struggled most. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a compliment,\u201d Milner says. \u201cHe thought I was a nuisance.\u201d\n\nMilner had far more critics at the start of his career \u2013 and he could have been ruined by comments attributed to Graeme Souness, his manager at Newcastle, who apparently said you can never win anything with a team of 11 James Milners. \u201cI was 18 so I wanted to show him he was wrong. Since then, he said he was misquoted. That was fuel for me, whether he said it or not. Ironically he was covering the game when we won the Premier League the first time at City. He didn\u2019t have to come over but he did. He was very nice and I have no problems with him. I think he\u2019s a legend.\u201d\n\nMilner was tested at City. There were occasions when he would drive home from training in tears because, no matter how well he played, he was left out of the team. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you feel like you can\u2019t do any more. But that\u2019s where you need that character and strength to bounce back. I always had good people around me which helped. The biggest thing in football, and life, is that you make mistakes. The best players might make a mistake once, twice maximum. But they learn from it and never do it again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milner smiles after the win over Tottenham on Sunday. Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images\n\nMilner has learned from his mistakes and, even after making his 500th Premier League appearance last season, he is hungry for more. At 33 he still tops the fitness tests at Liverpool. \u201cSomeone said to me, a few years back, that I\u2019m going to have to rein it in in training, and look after myself a bit. I didn\u2019t agree. I felt that the more I pushed myself, then the higher level I get in terms of fitness. I still feel very good and no different to what I did six years ago. My contract with Liverpool is up at the end of the season but hopefully we\u2019ll sort something out. I want to keep going as long as possible at the highest level.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Milner will continue having fun. \u201cI started using a sleeptalking app years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t use it every day but Robbo [Andy Robertson] and I had a laugh. Robbo said: \u2018I also talk in my sleep.\u2019 So we used it and we found it was me who was doing most of the talking \u2013 in Spanish. Robbo was making farm noises.\u201d\n\nThis perhaps shows who is the most intelligent out of Liverpool\u2019s two jokers? \u201cYou could say that. On the pitch Robbo is unbelievable and off the pitch he is a great character. He also had a difficult journey into football but his ability is massive. He\u2019s a big presence within the dressing room, lively, enjoys a joke and never shuts up. It\u2019s important to have those characters in the squad especially when, like us, you\u2019re chasing something special.\u201d\n\nJames Milner\u2019s Ask a Footballer is published by Quercus", "description": "The Liverpool midfielder talks to Donald McRae about the trouble with refereeing technology, the title race and why he talks in Spanish in his sleep", "authors": ["Donald Mcrae"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b3736542f1d61f07fed49b310b7e5dfdbd58b3f/0_137_6200_3720/master/6200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a78b03321e2f21e99d42b021de8af8ae", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
