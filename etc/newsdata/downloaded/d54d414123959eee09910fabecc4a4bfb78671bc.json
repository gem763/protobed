Alli beat Foster to a ball in an aerial duel and slotted the ball into the net with his second touch.\n\nThere was huge confusion in the stadium, though, as VAR checked for a possible handball by Alli, and the big screens then flashed a message that the goal had been disallowed. However, the referee pointed to the spot and the goal stood.\n\nIt saved Spurs from a third straight loss in all competitions, following the embarrassing 7-2 rout by Bayern Munich in the Champions League and a 3-0 defeat to Brighton before the international break.\n\nHowever, this latest setback still puts more pressure on manager Mauricio Pochettino, with Tottenham near midtable and losing more ground to its top-four rivals.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dele Alli scored a late equalizer on Saturday as Tottenham narrowly avoided another humbling loss, salvaging a 1-1 home draw against last-place Watford in the Premier League.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/19/britain_soccer_premier_league_84441_c185-0-3315-1826_s1200x700.jpg?35052b6098dbb13712b5351f10c557ba4eeb4d2f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
