In the 1990s, he bought a mansion in the exclusive Indian Creek island enclave on Biscayne Bay in Miami.\n\nThe move is scheduled for March 31 and employees who don\u2019t do so won\u2019t have a job, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter was private.\n\nA representative for Icahn declined to comment\n\nHedge fund billionaires have relocated to Florida for tax reasons for years -- David Tepper, Paul Tudor Jones and Eddie Lampert being among the most prominent. But Florida officials have been aggressively pushing Miami as a destination for money managers since the Republican-led tax overhaul. Signed by President Donald Trump in 2017, it set a $10,000 cap for state and local tax deductions, including income and real estate taxes.\n\nAs the tax bill was being negotiated, then Florida Governor Rick Scott, a former resident of Greenwich, Connecticut, made trips up north to court investment firms.\n\nFlorida is one of seven states without a personal income tax, while New York\u2019s top rate is 8.82%. Florida\u2019s corporate tax rate is 5.5%, compared with 6.5% in New York. Icahn\u2019s move was reported earlier by the New York Post.\n\nThe difference could mean dramatic savings for Icahn, who is the world\u2019s 47th richest person with a personal wealth of $20.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nHis investment vehicle, Icahn Enterprises LP, has a market value of $13.6 billion and reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $1.6 billion in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n--With assistance from Vonnie Quinn.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.net;Sonali Basak in New York at sbasak7@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, ;Michael J.
