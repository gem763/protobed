Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.\n\nMatthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A Los Angeles man was arrested Wednesday on charges that he sold counterfeit opioid pills to Mac Miller two days before the rapper died.", "authors": ["Andrew Dalton"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/mac-miller-death-opioids.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
