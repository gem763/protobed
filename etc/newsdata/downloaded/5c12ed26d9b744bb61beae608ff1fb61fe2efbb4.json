The tech workers are demanding their employers take stronger actions to combat climate change.\n\nGoogle\u2019s purchase includes a 1,600-megawatt package of wind and solar agreements and 18 new energy deals, increasing the company\u2019s agreements by 40 percent, according to Google. More than $2 billion will go to building out new infrastructure across the United States, Europe, and Chile as well. This purchase is \u201cequivalent to the capacity of a million solar rooftops,\u201d Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai said in a blog post Thursday.\n\nHe continued, \u201cIn all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7 billion in new construction and thousands of related jobs.\u201d\n\nGoogle has a history of making big renewable energy purchases. Last year, it announced a milestone \u2014 it purchased more renewable energy than it consumed as a company. Today\u2019s announcement expands its renewable reach even further. The company has also pledged to use recycled materials in all of its Made By Google products by 2022.\n\nBut many Google employees feel the company can still do more to reduce its environmental footprint. On Friday, hundreds of Google employees are staged to participate in the Global Climate Strike, led by students around the world in advance of the United Nation\u2019s climate summit on September 23rd. A host of other tech employees from companies like Amazon and Microsoft have also pledged to participate.\n\n\u201cTech is not \u2018green,\u2019\u201d some Google employees wrote in a Medium post published earlier this week. \u201cGoogle Cloud makes significant revenue licensing infrastructure, machine learning, and engineering talent to fossil fuel companies, promising to help them extract fuel reserves faster.\u201d\n\nThe post included demands for Google: zero emissions by 2030, zero contracts for fossil fuel companies \u201cto accelerate oil and gas extraction,\u201d eliminate funding for climate-denying lobbyists and politicians, and promises not to harm climate refugees, or individuals who may be displaced as a result of climate change.\n\n\u201cGoogle workers stand with students and our peers across tech in support of the climate movement, in support of frontline communities, and in support of a livable future \u2013 we are committed to bold action across the tech industry, and beyond. It\u2019s literally the only reasonable choice,\u201d the employees wrote.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos also made new climate promises on Thursday morning. Amazon\u2019s plan to fight climate change, called \u201cThe Climate Pledge,\u201d promises to reach the Paris climate agreement\u2019s most ambitious emissions-cutting targets ten years early, setting the company up to be carbon-neutral by 2040. Bezos also laid out other goals, like for Amazon to use 80 percent renewable energy by 2024 and to run on renewables alone by 2030.", "description": "Google\u2019s purchase includes a 1,600-megawatt package of wind and solar agreements and 18 new energy deals, increasing the company\u2019s agreements by 40 percent, according to Google.
