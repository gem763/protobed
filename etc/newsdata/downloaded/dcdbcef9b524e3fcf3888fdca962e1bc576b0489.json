This was affirmed at a meeting last year of Australia\u2019s bishops, who agreed that if the doctrine was to change it should be through the church\u2019s constitution and laws.", "description": "Melbourne synod\u2019s vote comes days after Sydney archbishop said Anglicans who back same-sex marriage should leave church", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d630d6e55dbf6612d8cb6cab0a5b230b36ae63/0_265_4974_2986/master/4974.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c8913b841aa506ad62e3a5508d11655", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
