As officials were checking the participants\u2019 uniforms, one of Abukaram's teammates was asked to change her shorts, which did not match the team's uniform. The runner changed, and Abukaram feared she would be approached next due to her all-black pants and hijab, according to a post shared on her cousin's Facebook page.\n\nAbukaram was relieved when nothing was said about her uniform until she realized that officials were still talking with the girl's varsity cross-country coach, Jeffery Flowers, even after the issue of her teammate's shorts was solved.\n\n\u201cWhen our team got to the line, an official asked for the written exemption letter coaches are required to have for uniform violations,\u201d coach Flowers tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI did not have one and the official said that I could either substitute another runner, ask her to take off her hijab, or she could race but would be disqualified at the finish. I made the decision to let her run.\u201d\n\nAccording to Flowers, there was no time to argue the decision, and \u201cthe official didn't feel he had the authority to do the right thing and not disqualify her.\u201d\n\n\"The coach learned of the disqualification at check-in before the race,\" Amy Addington, communications coordinator for Sylvania School District, confirms to Yahoo Lifestyle. \"In order to be respectful of her religious views, he did not ask her to remove her hijab.\"\n\nAbukaram ran the race, unaware that she was disqualified and that her time would not count.\n\n\"I ran a great race and the thought never crossed my mind again,\" Abukaram shared in the Facebook post. \"I finished my race, gave my teammates hugs, talked to people at the race and overall was having a great day.\"\n\nThen her team went to check their placings in the race. Abukaram's time was not listed; her teammates told her that it was because she was disqualified over her hijab.\n\n\"Immediately my heart drops, I become nauseous and feel like I got punched in the gut. This is something that I had always feared which has now become a reality,\" Abukaram wrote.\n\nFlowers timed the race for her. It was her best time of the season: 22 minutes and 22 seconds. Unfortunately, the time is not official.\n\n\u201cThe officials did not give me the same respect that they gave my teammate who was also violating a rule when they told her to change her shorts and gave her the chance to fix her self,\" Abukaram wrote. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given the chance to explain myself to them because they didn\u2019t have the decency to tell me what the issue was.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI feel like my rights as an athlete were violated this weekend because this rule does NOT exist in writing. I should not have to get a waiver signed and approved by OHSAA to allow me to race due to my religious head covering. Hijabs are not specifically prohibited by OHSAA rulings.\u201d\n\nFlowers tells Yahoo Lifestyle that the waiver requirement was presented verbally the previous year at the rules meeting, but they received no warning this season until the district meet. He assumed it was no longer a rule. After the disqualification, which left his runner feeling disappointed and singled out, he checked the rule book.\n\n\u201cI couldn't/can't find in the rule book any clause that prevents or prohibits hair coverings like Noor's,\u201d Flowers tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe OHSAA and I have been in contact and they have issued an exemption. They expressed their sympathy, but felt that the official was correct to disqualify Noor.\u201d\n\nAccording to Addington, the coaching staff has been in contact with OHSAA to ensure Abukaram will be eligible to run in future races.", "description": "A high school junior was disqualified from a district cross-country meet for wearing a hijab, despite it never being a problem in the past three years of her high school athletic career.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3TbiX_FYIOsRN81PieEijg--~B/aD05OTg7dz0xNjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/46d7f350-f5ee-11e9-bffd-e131a7fdecf7", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
