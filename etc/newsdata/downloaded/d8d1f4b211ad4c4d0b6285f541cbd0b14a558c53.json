We've been speaking to a lot of House members, a lot of Republicans, a lot of Democrats. And people want to do something. So we're going to see.\"\n\n\"This really hasn't changed anything. We're doing a package, and we'll see what it all \u2014 how it comes about. It's coming about right now. And a lot of people are talking about it. And that's irrespective of what happened yesterday in Texas.\"", "description": "The White House has yet to offer any official proposals on gun legislation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/14/856c7c14-130e-4a18-925c-70d8a5625030/thumbnail/1200x630g2/529fab7fb3997c090d416914dfecf693/mcconnelltrump.jpg"}
