But when questioned on whether the president had agreed to provide aid to Ukraine only after it investigated Mr Biden, Mr Giuliani said the president would have had \"every right\" to withhold aid to another country unless corruption is eliminated.\n\nMr Giuliani confirmed to the New York Times in late August that he had lobbed the new Ukrainian government to investigate Mr Biden, but he said he did so as a private citizen and could not say whether Mr Trump was aware of his effort, or whether he approved of it.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Nonetheless, he has faced widespread criticism for accepting the position while his father was vice president.", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer has denied requesting the Ukraine investigate Joe Biden \u2013 before, seconds later, admitting he did.
