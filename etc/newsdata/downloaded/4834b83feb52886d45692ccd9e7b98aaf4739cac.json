USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL trade deadline is no longer merely an exercise in conjecture.\n\nLook no further than last year for evidence of how teams have embraced the opportunity to either shed contracts or add a key piece at midseason. While the Cowboys' acquisition of Amari Cooper proved to be the biggest move before the cutoff, several other big names were also dealt, including Golden Tate, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Dante Fowler, among others.\n\nThis year, several notable swaps have already been completed, with the Rams landing perhaps the biggest name on the market last week in Jalen Ramsey. And several more moves could be brewing in the coming days.\n\nWith next Tuesday's deadline drawing near, here are seven more trades that NFL teams should make, with a feasibility ranking (1-10, with 10 being most sensible for both sides) for the proposed deal.\n\nBills trade for Bengals WR A.J. Green\n\nAt 5-1 with just three games remaining against winning teams, Buffalo is in prime position to reach double-digit wins and secure one of the AFC's wild card spots. But second-year quarterback Josh Allen's erratic play and poor accuracy on deep throws proved to be the team's undoing in the lone loss to the Patriots, and his shortcomings could put a ceiling on the Bills' season. Green, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, has proven he can elevate a passing game with his penchant for winning contested catches and creating separation on intermediate-to-deep routes.\n\nFeasibility factor: 2. Despite their 0-7 start, the Bengals have insisted they won't be moving the 31-year-old. Bills general manager Brandon Beane and coach Sean McDermott also seemed to be aligned in focusing their building efforts through the draft, and acquiring a free-agent-to-be in Green would likely be both costly and risky.\n\nLions trade for Chargers RB Melvin Gordon\n\nAfter a holdout that lasted through the first four weeks of the season produced no resolution for either side, both Gordon and the Chargers have seen their season go into a tailspin. In three games, the two-time Pro Bowl back is averaging just 2.3 yards per carry and has yet to take a tote for more than 7 yards. Los Angeles, meanwhile, is 2-5 and three games back of the AFC West-leading Chiefs. While the market for running backs might be minimal, Detroit could be a candidate for backfield reinforcements given starter Kerryon Johnson landing on injured reserve. The Lions are still hoping to stay relevant after keeping things close in their three losses to playoff contenders, and a rejuvenated Gordon could help them make a push in the competitive NFC North.\n\nFeasibility factor: 3. The Bolts would be selling Gordon at an all-time low if they were to swing a deal now. The Lions also aren't a certainty to add a ball-carrier, and there could be cheaper alternatives available, including Kenyan Drake of the Dolphins.\n\nSeahawks trade for Titans TE Delanie Walker\n\nThe loss of Will Dissly for the season might not register with many as a consequential injury hit, but the tight end had become a staple for Russell Wilson in the passing game. And though Seattle could scrape by with Luke Willson, the Seahawks offense would be better off if John Schneider returns to his aggressive ways by finding another option via trade. A suitable fit could be Walker, the sure-handed veteran who looks expendable for a low-volume Tennessee passing attack that has already endured a starting quarterback change.\n\nFeasibility factor: 7. Even if Tennessee doesn't view itself as a seller, it can move on from the 35-year-old without much disruption by turning to third-year pro Jonnu Smith. Walker has been dealing with knee and ankle issues this year, but he could provide a boost to a Seattle offense that currently only has two tight ends on the active roster.\n\nEagles trade for Broncos CB Chris Harris Jr.\n\nWith Ramsey and Marcus Peters already having been dealt and the Cardinals declaring that Patrick Peterson isn't available, options for teams needing a cornerback are dwindling. That could turn the focus to Harris, a 30-year-old four-time Pro Bowl selection stuck on a 2-5 Broncos team in the final year of his contract. Philadelphia would benefit greatly from a veteran capable of holding up in man coverage, as its young core has been roasted for eight pass plays of 40+ yards already this season.\n\nFeasibility factor: 5. Despite sending Emmanuel Sanders to the 49ers, Denver might be done dealing. John Elway said Wednesday no team had reached out recently on Harris, and the cornerback himself said he is not expecting to be moved. Eagles GM Howie Roseman could change that outlook with a bold offer, though Philadelphia also might be inclined to add help at receiver or on the defensive line.\n\nSaints trade for Dolphins WR DeVante Parker\n\nWhat better way to welcome Drew Brees back from a thumb injury than by affording the quarterback a new target? The Saints' offense still runs through Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara, with the two accounting for 56.2% of the team's catches and 57.4% of the receiving yards. At 6-3 and 215 pounds, Parker could provide assistance in the red zone for an attack that has converted a pedestrian 50% of its trips inside the 20 into touchdowns.\n\nFeasibility factor: 8. Parker has often been the subject of trade speculation, but maybe the timing is finally right for the former first-round pick to get his change of scenery. Miami has made it clear it's comfortable strip-mining its roster for draft picks, and Parker is one of the remaining players who could fetch another valuable 2020 selection. New Orleans has the means and motive to pull this off, and Parker's contract provides flexibility thanks to a team option for next year that includes no guaranteed money.\n\nRaiders trade for Jaguars DE Yannick Ngakoue\n\nFinding the next Khalil Mack \u2014 or at least a suitable substitute \u2014 was never going to be easy for Oakland. Yet at a surprising 3-3, the Raiders are still being weighed down by a lackluster pass rush that's tied for 27th in the NFL with 10 sacks. Ngakoue, who has 31 1/2 sacks in 54 career games, would add a needed dose of speed opposite struggling first-round rookie Clelin Ferrell. Perhaps Jacksonville would part with him given that the team eschewed his contract demands in a fruitless summer holdout.\n\nFeasibility factor: 3. Though unloading Ramsey to the Rams showed Jacksonville is willing to recoup what it can from a frayed relationship, Tom Coughlin and Co. seem unlikely to enter fire-sale mode, especially when they're only a game and a half back of the Colts for the AFC South lead. And while the Raiders seem like a fit for Ngakoue, Raiders GM Mike Mayock might be reticent to give up significant draft capital for a pass rusher who will also command a significant payday come March.\n\nChiefs trade for Jets DE Leonard Williams\n\nWith a Patrick Mahomes injury catastrophe averted, Kansas City can turns its attention toward a defense that had been trampled for at least 180 rushing yards in four consecutive games before last week's win against the Broncos. Williams is stout against the run and has the versatility to jump to thrive in different roles on Kansas City's 4-3 front.\n\nFeasibility factor: 6. Jets coach Adam Gase left open the possibility last week that the team would move on from Williams, and first-year general manager Joe Douglas shouldn't have any attachment to a former first rounder who doesn't seem to have a sure place in the team's future. Chiefs general manager Brett Veach hasn't been afraid to swing trades, but Williams might not be enticing enough as a potential half-season rental.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "The NFL trade deadline is just days away, and several big names could be on the move.
