Trump has been running the family business with his older brother Don Jr. since their father became president in 2017.\n\nHe said that Hunter Biden made $600,000 a year working for \"a little company in Ukraine\" but that it\u2019s systematic of a larger problem \u2013 of people going to Washington who then \"never want to leave.\" \"It's very very sad,\" he said.\n\nBoard members of Exxon Mobil (one of the worlds largest and most prestigious energy companies) make $330,000 annually.\n\n\n\nHunter Biden, with no industry knowledge or duties, was being paid $600,000 annually.\n\n\n\nAll of this while the average annual salary in Ukraine is $1700 per year. \u2014 Eric Trump (@EricTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nDespite the repeated allegations from President Trump and his allies, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor-general told Bloomberg in an interview that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son. Yuriy Lutsenko said in the interview that \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly swatted away questions about the Trump Organization's own apparent conflicts of interest. Trump, for example, has many business ties with Turkey. The Trump Towers in Istanbul is nearly 40 stories tall and described by the Trump organization as \"a landmark in the historic city of Istanbul.\" Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, attended the opening in 2012.\n\nIn a phone call this past Sunday, President Trump gave Erdo\u011fan the go ahead for a military action against Kurdish forces in Northern Syria who have long fought alongside Americans. \u201cWe are out of there,\u201d President Trump said on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the conversation with Yahoo Finance on Thursday, Eric Trump touted the Istanbul towers and said licensing deals had allowed the Trump Organization to work with partners to get access to different worldwide markets. Creating ties with local officials gives local access that \u201cyou don\u2019t know if you are trying to go into in Turkey,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout the wide-ranging conversation, Eric Trump saved his harshest words for Democrats but also suggested that politics was corrupting for both sides of the aisle. When Mitch McConnell, who has been in the U.S. Senate since 1985, was brought up, Trump noted that, \"I think it's systematic in politics,\" and that \"money has corrupted politics in a big way and it's very, very sad.\"\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders just as a comparison,\u201d he said. \u201cIn New York, they\u2019ll be best friends because they have one goal in mind and that\u2019s to build the greatest company or to develop the greatest widget.\u201d But he added that in politics \u201cwhat really motivates people? Oftentimes it\u2019s greed.\u201d\n\nEric Trump attends a rally of his father U.S. President Donald Trump in West Virginia in August 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria More\n\n\u201cThey are fighting to retain power and it\u2019s something we\u2019d never really come across as a family before,\u201d Eric Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019d always been on the opposite side.\u201d While President Trump and his allies often describe him as new to politics, he dabbled in the public arena for many many years. In October 2000, for example, Donald Trump announced the creation of a presidential exploratory committee as a candidate of the Reform Party. He ended the campaign about five months later.\n\nEric Trump added a comparison between the Trump campaign\u2019s two worlds. \u201cI always thought that New York real estate was the most cutthroat industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pales in comparison to politics.\u201d\n\nYahoo Finance More\n\n\n\n", "description": "Eric Trump has been one of his father's staunchest defenders and he took his criticisms of president\u2019s political opponents to another level on Thursday.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro", "Ben Werschkul"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gYU5Y3GsWP0mNUvKfBYIUA--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/079ef010-eace-11e9-b3fc-c21c662aaf13", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
