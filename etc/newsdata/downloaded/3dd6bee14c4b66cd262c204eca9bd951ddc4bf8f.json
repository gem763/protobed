It\u2019s abuse. Between people it\u2019d be reason to never speak again, and between nations it\u2019s cause for complaints to the United Nations Security Council about foreign interference.\n\nBut when American Anne Sacoolas was accused of driving the car that knocked Harry Dunn off his motorbike, leaving him with injuries so catastrophic he could not survive, the other half of our \u201cspecial \u00adrelationship\u201d sheltered her from the consequences.\n\nShe invoked immunity as the wife of a US security agent working at an RAF airbase, and caught the first plane out while police were seeking permission to formally \u00adquestion her.\n\nAs a mum whose 12-year-old son was reportedly in the car with her and witnessed the crash, she may be enduring the nightmares of a guilty conscience. But she has left behind more than one dead 19-year-old \u2013 Harry\u2019s family were wounded too, and Sacoolas\u2019s disappearance denies them any chance of healing.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhen Gary McKinnon and Lauri Love were accused of hacking US state security, long court battles were waged to extradite them. Eventually it was blocked, but only after years of worry. They were not accused of killing anyone, yet the US threatened lifelong jail terms.\n\nThe only thing Sacoolas would have to face here is, maybe, a judge and jury. They would consider CCTV footage of her car on the wrong side of the road and any defence she might offer.\n\nThe maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving is a two-year ban, and a maximum sentence of 14 years if she was found guilty. But with mitigation, good behaviour and parole, she might serve only a year or two, in a peaceful, cushy nick.\n\nWith her children educated at boarding school, it would have far less impact on her family than it does on many.\n\nThis is the hell from which she is protected, while Harry\u2019s family endure worse.\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with America First \u2013 everything else comes second. This is our major international partner. The one we were told that, post-Brexit, we could rely on. If the US was our friend, it would admit that immunity is for government employees at risk of prosecution for doing their jobs \u2013 not a get out of jail free card for their families.\n\nDonald Trump likes to say there is no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d He\u2019s right \u2013 we get little in return for our friendship. Had the wife of a British spy fled after allegedly killing an American teen, there\u2019d be a Trumpian tweetstorm.\n\nBoris Johnson might vow to \u201craise\" the issue, but our one-sided \u201cfriendship\u201d will be maintained at the expense of Harry, his family, and common decency.", "description": "What\u2019s the point of an ally who stops you bringing alleged killers to justice?", "authors": ["Susie Boniface", "Image", "Pa", "Sky News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537429.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAIN-MAIN-Harry-Dunn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
