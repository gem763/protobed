Elizabeth Warren are beginning to shift away from showing support for a broad number of candidates and are increasingly falling behind the Massachussetts senator and a smaller group of 2020 hopefuls, according to new Insider polling.\n\nSince the spring, the fraction of voters who say they like Warren and at most one or two other candidates has gone up by 10 percentage points, according to the poll. Meanwhile, the number of voters who say they like Warren and three to five other candidates has dropped by 9.5 percentage points during the same period. At the same time, the percentage of voters who say the like Warren and six or more other candidates has remained stagnant.\n\nAdditionally, the number of voters who say they stand behind Warren \u2014 and only Warren \u2014 has gone up by 1.5 percentage points between the spring and fall, the poll found.\n\nThough it's a slow process, it's a sign that while voters' first choices may remain in flux, for Warren the competition may be falling away.\n\nTo help make sense of where all the 2020 candidates stand, Insider has been conducting a recurring SurveyMonkey Audience national poll. You can download every poll here, down to the individual respondent data.

If Warren continues to see supporters of other candidates shift her way as they fall out of favor or drop out of the race, it could increase her prospects of becoming the frontrunner and ultimately the Democratic nominee.\n\nAt the moment, Biden continues to dominate most national polls, with Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont trailing. But Warren has pulled ahead of Biden in some polls, including in early voting states that are key to clinching the presidential nomination like Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nWarren and Sanders also raised more than Biden in the third quarter. Sanders raised $25.3 million, Warren raised $24.6 million, and Biden $15.7 million.\n\nIn short, things are looking up for Warren, particularly as Biden struggles to provide a forceful response to President Donald Trump's attacks amid the Ukraine scandal.", "description": "Since the spring, the fraction of voters who say they like Warren and at most one or two other candidates has gone up by 10 percentage points.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db8a777dee0196185778093?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
