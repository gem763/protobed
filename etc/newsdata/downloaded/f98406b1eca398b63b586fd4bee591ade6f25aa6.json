And the survey revealed significant defections among some non-Republican constituencies that helped Mr. Trump win in 2016, namely the white working class. This trend is driven by white women without a college degree, 40 percent of whom now say they support impeaching and removing him, compared with 29 percent who said so in mid-September.\n\nThose figures are especially problematic because of the political clout those women have in the Midwestern states that put Mr. Trump over the top in the Electoral College in 2016. That year, the group supported Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton, 61 percent to 34 percent.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Impeachment-Survey.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
