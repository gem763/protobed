One million subscribers over five days is an impressive feat regardless of platform, and it\u2019s a strong testament to Blevins\u2019 popularity and the strength of his personal brand regardless of platform. Yet it\u2019s unclear how many of those subscribers will be still there in two months, after a free promotion expires and fans will have to pay a monthly fee to continue receiving exclusive perks.\n\nToday we hit 1,000,000 active subscribers on mixer ^-^ thank you for all the incredible support. I haven't felt this good in a long time. pic.twitter.com/kdLgBJk0Ud \u2014 Ninja (@Ninja) August 6, 2019\n\nMixer\u2019s decision to gift two free months of subscriptions to Blevins\u2019 channel is an attempt to bring as many people over to the platform in as short a time as possible. But after that period runs out, the price will jump to at least $5.99 a month. (Mixer streamers can also earn money through the platform\u2019s Sparks currency, similar to Bits on Twitch.)\n\nStill, if Blevins continues growing at this rate, he might just break a few of his old records. He previously amassed more than 3 million subscribers on YouTube in just one month last year, during his meteoric rise alongside Fortnite. His account now has more than 22 million subscribers, making it even bigger than his Twitch channel.\n\nBoth YouTube and Twitch have something that Mixer currently doesn\u2019t \u2014 an extremely large viewership base. Mixer only accounts for three percent of time spent watching game streams online; Twitch receives about 72 percent of time spent. It\u2019s a big difference, and it\u2019s what\u2019s led other streamers, like Guy \u201cDr Disrespect\u201d Beahm, to comment on how long Blevins\u2019 viewership will remain high.\n\n\u201cI just have a feeling \u2014 and I\u2019m just kind of going off gut right now \u2014 that unless they pick up somebody, a few other big names, I think [Blevins\u2019] numbers are going to go down,\u201d Beahm said on a recent stream.\n\nBeahm added it has nothing to do with Blevins or his content, but rather \u201cexposure on the platform.\u201d The argument that many streamers have made is that Mixer needs a few more big names, which the company may be working on. YouTuber and podcast host Ethan Klein recently suggested that he spoke to a popular Twitch streamer who was also talking to Mixer in an effort to leave Twitch.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Blevins\u2019 subscribers will stay, but at least for the moment, he\u2019s riding high.", "description": "After just five days of streaming, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins is boasting 1 million active subscribers on Mixer, the Microsoft-owned platform that made him jump ship from Twitch. \"Thank you for all the incredible support,\" Blevins tweeted when announcing the milestone. \"I haven\u2019t felt this good in a long time.\"", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aImxS_sApnoAFGUzizK-L_L3ZUY=/0x36:1200x664/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18938899/Screen_Shot_2019_08_01_at_10.41.01_AM.0.png.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-06"}
