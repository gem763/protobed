They rely on our infrastructure, our expertise, and our sales so they must pay their fair share into society. Outrageous.\"\n\nTom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, said the amount Facebook had paid in tax was \"insulting\". He said: \"The least they can do is pay a fair amount of tax.\"\n\nFacebook's UK accounts reveal that its total tax charge almost doubled to \u00a330.4m in 2018, up from \u00a315.7m a year earlier. After adjustments made for deferred tax and changes in tax rates, it actually paid \u00a328.5m to the taxman.", "description": "Facebook has been blasted by MPs and experts after it paid just \u00a328.", "authors": ["Hannah Boland", "Ben Marlow", "Mason Boycott-Owen", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/09/19/TELEMMGLPICT000158079643-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_GO3ERunmEg2UTF5U96KcxiaO8_IosUbJEhV13zkYuY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
