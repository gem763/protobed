To play like they\u2019ve done in the \u201960s and \u201970s is obviously brilliant. To continue the Doyle legacy is fantastic for me.\n\n\u201cHopefully Mike was looking down proud and I\u2019ve done everything for him as well.\u201d\n\nA debut at the Etihad Stadium was a special moment for the City fan, and he was grateful to his team-mates for helping him make the most of it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t too (nervous),\u201d he said. \u201cKyle Walker asked me if I was feeling nervous and he said \u2018I\u2019ve got your back\u2019.\n\n\u201cOnce he said that I was fine, I was just looking forward to it and buzzing. I couldn\u2019t rest, I was walking around all day and then when the time came, I was ready.\u201d\n\nWith Rodri injured and Fernandinho \u2013 deployed mostly in defence this season \u2013 suspended, Pep Guardiola turned to Doyle in order to give Ilkay Gundogan a much-needed rest.\n\nHe was one of three teenagers in the City starting XI along with Phil Foden and Eric Garcia and, having got a taste for it, Doyle is hoping to get more chances in Guardiola\u2019s side soon.\n\n\u201cI want to go out there now and do it all again, but I\u2019ll just keep knuckling down, get my head down, keep grafting and listen to every bit of information I get from the players and the staff, and then see what happens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI just want to keep kicking on and looking forward to the future.\u201d\n\nWhile City progressed, extending their unbeaten record in the competition to some 14 matches over three years, Southampton looked at the positives as they showed some response following Friday\u2019s 9-0 thrashing at the hands of Leicester.\n\nIt gets no easier as they must return to the Etihad in the Premier League on Saturday, but Ralph Hasenhuttl believes his side now have something to build on after Jack Stephens\u2019 late goal rewarded their best spell of the match.\n\n\u201cHappy would be the wrong word but we\u2019re clear, discussing things, tired because we invested so much but OK,\u201d he said of the post-match mood in the dressing room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than Friday I must say. But for me it\u2019s a very new and interesting situation.\n\n\u201cIn all the meetings we found the right tone and it\u2019s good for the guys that they showed they want to come back on a good track and this is what we have to do.\u201d", "description": "The 18-year-old midfielder put in an assured performance as City advanced to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup with a 3-1 win over Southampton.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/wire-20371404-1572434674-420_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
