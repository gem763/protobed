For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nBillionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein was arrested for allegedly sex trafficking dozens of minors in New York and Florida between 2002 and 2005, and will appear in court in New York on Monday, according to three law enforcement sources. Epstein, who owns a New York City mansion and an island in the Caribbean, was being held at the federal lockup in Manhattan ahead of his court date.\n\nSaturday\u2019s arrest by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force comes about 12 years after the 66-year-old financier essentially got a slap on the wrist for allegedly molesting dozens of underage girls in Florida.\n\nFor more than a decade, Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse of minors has been the subject of lawsuits brought by victims, investigations by local and federal authorities, and expos\u00e9s in the press. But despite the attention cast on his alleged sex crimes, the hedge-funder has managed to avoid any meaningful jail time, let alone federal charges.\n\nThe new indictment\u2014which, according to two sources, will be unsealed Monday in Manhattan federal court\u2014will reportedly allege that Epstein sexually exploited dozens of underage girls in a now-familiar scheme: paying them cash for \u201cmassages\u201d and then molesting or sexually abusing them in his Upper East Side mansion or his palatial residence in Palm Beach. Epstein will be charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors\u2014which could put him away for a maximum of 45 years. The case is being handled by the Public Corruption Unit of the Southern District of New York, with assistance from the district's human-trafficking officials and the FBI.\n\nSeveral of the billionaire's employees and associates allegedly recruited the girls for Epstein's abuse, and some victims eventually became recruiters themselves, according to law enforcement. The girls were as young as 14, and Epstein knew they were underage, according to details of the arrest and indictment shared by two officials.\n\nEpstein's attorney Martin Weinberg declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast on Saturday night. The SDNY also declined to comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming\u2014it\u2019s been too long coming,\u201d said attorney David Boies, who represents Epstein accusers Virginia Roberts Giuffre and Sarah Ransome. \u201cIt is an important step towards getting justice for the many victims of Mr. Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking enterprise.\n\n\u201cWe hope that prosecutors will not stop with Mr. Epstein because there were many other people who participated with him and made the sex trafficking possible,\" he told The Daily Beast.\n\nIn an era where #MeToo has toppled powerful men, Epstein\u2019s name was largely absent from the national conversation, until the Miami Herald published a three-part series on how his wealth, power and influence shielded him from federal prosecution. For years, The Daily Beast has reported on Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse, starting with Conchita Sarnoff's exposes on his easy jail sentence and soft treatment by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which ultimately scrapped a 53-page indictment against Epstein. An earlier version of Epstein\u2019s plea deal included a 10-year federal sentence\u2014before his star-studded lawyers threatened to go to trial in a case prosecutors feared was unwinnable, in part because Epstein\u2019s team dredged up dirt on the victims, including social media posts indicating drug use.\n\nMeanwhile, the financier flitted among his homes in Palm Beach, New York City, and the Virgin Islands, as well as his secluded Zorro Ranch in Stanley, New Mexico, transporting young women on his private jet to facilitate the sexual abuse that\u2019s gone unchecked by authorities, his alleged victims say.\n\nIn an announcement planned for Monday the FBI is expected to provide a number for other victims to contact the SDNY.\n\nAs early as 2003, Vicky Ward\u2019s Vanity Fair profile cracked into Epstein\u2019s enigmatic facade and, as Ward noted, revealed \u201che was definitely not what he claimed to be.\u201d Back then, allegations of sexual abuse leveled by one accuser, Maria Farmer, and her family were excised from Ward\u2019s piece after Epstein pressured the magazine.\n\nEpstein\u2019s bust comes mere months after a federal judge ruled his 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA)\u2014secretly inked under former U.S. Attorney and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta\u2014violated federal law by keeping Epstein\u2019s victims in the dark. Under the sweetheart deal, Epstein dodged federal charges that might have sent him to prison for life. He instead pleaded guilty to minor state charges in Palm Beach, and served 13 months in a private wing of a county jail, mostly on work release.\n\nThe alleged victims, who sued the government for violating the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act, asked the court to rescind Epstein\u2019s non-prosecution agreement and called for the feds to hold him criminally liable. The NPA also granted immunity to Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators, identified in the document as \u201cincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\u201d\n\nBut in June, prosecutors for the government advised the judge to uphold the plea deal, saying that voiding it would \u201ccause unintended harm to many of\u201d the victims and jeopardize monetary settlements that more than a dozen of them received.\n\n\"If today\u2019s report is true, it only proves that Epstein should have been charged by federal prosecutors 12 years ago in Florida. With his money, Epstein was able to buy more than a decade of delay in facing justice\u2014but fortunately he wasn\u2019t able to postpone justice forever,\" said attorney Paul Cassell, who represents multiple victims of Epstein in their lawsuit against the federal government.\n\n\"While New York prosecutors are apparently seeking to hold Epstein accountable, the fight will continue to force federal prosecutors in Florida to do the same thing,\" Cassell added in a statement. \"While Epstein was at the head of the international sex trafficking organization, that conspiracy could not have functioned without many others playing their part. Jane Doe 1 and 2 will continue to fight for all of Epstein\u2019s co-conspirators to be held accountable in New York, Florida, and anywhere else they committed crimes.\"\n\nEpstein reportedly supplied valuable intel to federal investigators in exchange for his lenient plea deal; it\u2019s been speculated this information may have been related to Bear Stearns executives\u2019 alleged crimes in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAccording to one Page Six report, Epstein lost $57 million in Bear Stearns\u2019 collapse and was a victim identified as \u201cMajor Investor No. 1\u201d in the indictment of hedge-fund managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tanin. (A federal jury acquitted Cioffi and Tanin of securities fraud charges.) But in March 2019, FOX Business reported that Epstein \u201cdid not provide any meaningful cooperation to obtain his relatively light sentence in the hedge fund case or likely any case tied to the financial crisis.\u201d Jack Goldberger, one of Epstein\u2019s attorneys in the Palm Beach sex crimes case, told FOX of the Bear Stearns\u2019 prosecution, \u201cMr. Epstein was never spoken to by any of the authorities on this subject. He was a very large investor. No more, no less.\u201d\n\nOne former federal prosecutor on the Bear Stearns case agreed. \u201cBottom line, I have no knowledge of Epstein cooperating in any way in the Bear Stearns case. There was no reason to use him,\u201d the ex-prosecutor told FOX.\n\nEpstein\u2019s Victims\n\nOnce a math teacher at the elite Dalton School, Jeffrey Epstein left for Bear Stearns before starting his own firm, J. Epstein & Co., which supposedly only managed the fortunes of billionaires. Les Wexner, chairman of Limited Brands, is his only known client. (In April 2019, a new accuser came forward with claims that Epstein and his alleged madame, Ghislaine Maxwell, assaulted her at Wexner\u2019s Ohio residence in the 1990s. Epstein, Maxwell and Wexner have not commented on these allegations.)\n\nEpstein\u2019s financial career has always been shrouded in mystery.\n\nOver the years, Epstein billed himself as a renowned philanthropist and in press releases, claimed to pledge $30 million for Harvard\u2019s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. (According to a Harvard source familiar with the donation, however, Epstein only wrote a check for $6.5 million.) He\u2019s palled around with a host of famous faces including Donald Trump and Bill Clinton; the latter traveled with Epstein to Africa to address issues like economic development and AIDS.\n\nIn a 2002 profile in New York, one fellow Wall Streeter described Epstein as a \u201cmysterious, Gatsbyesque figure\u201d who \u201clikes people to think that he is very rich\u201d and \u201ccultivates this air of aloofness.\u201d Another prominent investor added: \u201cHe once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I\u2019ve also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It\u2019s like looking at the Wizard of Oz\u2014there may be less there than meets the eye.\u201d\n\nVanity Fair\u2019s 2003 take on Epstein compared him to the self-made Jay Gatsby, too. \u201cThe trading desks don\u2019t seem to know him. It\u2019s unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,\u201d one insider told the magazine.\n\nDuring his high-flying finance years, Epstein also allegedly harbored a dark secret: his widespread abuse of underage girls. In 2005, Palm Beach police launched an investigation into Epstein after a 14-year-old girl told police an older man named \u201cJeff\u201d had molested her at his residence, a two-story pink mansion on a dead-end street.\n\nAuthorities would discover a disturbing teen sex ring, where victims were allegedly paid to recruit other young girls to provide \u201cmassages\u201d inside Epstein\u2019s lair. The victims would be led to Epstein\u2019s bedroom, and Epstein would enter and order them to remove their clothing, police said. The financier would then assault them\u2014sometimes forcing them into intercourse with him or a young woman he described as his \u201csex slave\u201d\u2014and pay them $200 to $1,000 per visit, according to court documents.\n\nPolice say Epstein\u2019s massages were booked with the help of his personal assistants, including Sarah Kellen, who kept a rolodex of underage girls.\n\nBut as The Daily Beast previously reported, the state attorney\u2019s office in Palm Beach declined to pursue serious charges against Epstein (filing only a single felony count of soliciting prostitution), claiming the girls weren\u2019t credible. The local police chief, Michael Reiter, accused prosecutors of giving Epstein special treatment and in 2006 referred the case to the FBI. By May 2007, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami drafted a 53-page indictment against Epstein, alongside an 82-page prosecution memorandum. That summer, however, Epstein\u2019s lawyers worked to unravel the case, claiming Epstein wasn\u2019t guilty of any federal crimes.\n\n\u201c The local police chief, Michael Reiter, accused prosecutors of giving Epstein special treatment and in 2006 referred the case to the FBI. \u201d\n\nEpstein and the feds drew up a non-prosecution agreement in September 2007. Without informing any of the victims, the two sides decided that Epstein would plead guilty to a pair of state charges (solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution) and waive his right to contest damages, if the victims decided to sue him over the abuse. He also agreed to pay for the girls\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nIndeed, the NPA stated that \u201cthe United States, in consultation with and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein\u2019s counsel, shall select an attorney representative for [the victims], who shall be paid for by Epstein.\u201d\n\nThe NPA also granted immunity to any \u201cpotential co-conspirator\u201d of Epstein\u2019s and ensured the deal would \u201cnot be made part of any public record.\u201d\n\nEpstein could have faced multiple federal charges, the NPA noted, including: sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud or coercion, 18 U.S.C. 1591; the use of a facility or means of interstate commerce to entice minors into prostitution, 18 U.S.C. 2422(b); and traveling for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors, 18 U.S.C. 2423(b). The document states Epstein might have committed those crimes from around 2001 to September 2007.\n\nOther women claim that Epstein\u2019s alleged abuse spanned many years and many locations, according to civil court filings.\n\n\u201c Epstein could have faced multiple federal charges, the NPA noted, including sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud or coercion. \u201d\n\nIn an April 2019 affidavit, a woman named Maria Farmer said she met Epstein and Maxwell sometime in 1995, at one of Farmer\u2019s art shows in New York. In 1996, Epstein offered her a job to help him acquire art. But according to Farmer, she instead ended up manning the door at Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side mansion and keeping records of his visitors.\n\nSome of those visitors, Farmer claimed, were underage girls in school uniforms who would be led to an upstairs bedroom for what Maxwell called interviews for \u201cmodeling\u201d positions. Farmer witnessed Epstein\u2019s lawyer and friend, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, head upstairs where the girls were present, the affidavit stated.\n\nDershowitz has denied Farmer\u2019s accusations. \u201cMaria Farmer stopped working for Epstein before I ever met Epstein,\u201d Dershowitz told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally perjured affidavit. It\u2019s all totally made up. For her lawyers to submit these obviously perjured affidavits raises serious questions about their role in this case.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Epstein allegedly arranged for Farmer to work on a special art project at Leslie Wexner\u2019s mansion in New Albany, Ohio. Farmer and her two younger brothers stayed at the property at the time.\n\nFarmer claims Maxwell and Epstein sexually assaulted her at the Ohio property, and Wexner\u2019s security team refused to let her leave. She said she tried calling the sheriff\u2019s office but didn\u2019t get a response. Her father had to drive from Kentucky to help her.\n\nOnce she returned to New York, Farmer visited the NYPD\u2019s sixth precinct to report the Ohio assault, but officers there told her to contact the FBI. Farmer called the feds, but they didn\u2019t appear to take any action, the affidavit states.\n\nMeanwhile, Farmer claims Epstein and Maxwell preyed on her 15-year-old sister, molesting her at Epstein\u2019s ranch in New Mexico. Epstein also held her sibling\u2019s hand at a New York movie theater, where he \u201cwas rubbing her in a sexual manner without my knowledge,\u201d Farmer added.\n\n\u201cI was terrified of Maxwell and Epstein and I moved a number of times to try to hide from them,\u201d Farmer stated of the powerful pair\u2019s alleged threats against her and their alleged efforts to sabotage her reputation in the art world.\n\nAnother accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, has long claimed that Epstein and Maxwell abused minor girls across the country and abroad, and that Epstein loaned his victims out to his famous friends, including Dershowitz and Prince Andrew.\n\nGiuffre filed a declaration in 2015 as part of the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act suit and detailed Epstein\u2019s alleged sex ring. She said she met Epstein in 1999 after Maxwell approached her during her summer job at Mar-a-Lago. She was 15 years old.\n\nDershowitz and Prince Andrew vehemently denied Giuffre\u2019s claims, and Buckingham Place quickly released a statement: \u201cIt is emphatically denied that HRH The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. The allegations made are false and without any foundation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story is totally made up,\u201d Dershowitz told the BBC after Giuffre\u2019s court filing made international headlines. He added, \u201cMy only feeling is if she\u2019s lied about me, which I know to an absolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201c It wasn\u2019t just sexual training\u2014they wanted me to be able to cater to all the needs of the men they were going to send me to. \u201d\n\nMaxwell allegedly offered Giuffre professional training in massages. But when Giuffre arrived at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach home, she was allegedly forced into sexual activity with the billionaire and would become trapped in his web.\n\nShe said that when she began \u201cworking\u201d for Epstein, he flew her to New York on his private jet and molested her at his Manhattan mansion. \u201cI was trained to be \u2018everything a man wanted me to be,\u2019\u201d Giuffre said in the declaration. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just sexual training\u2014they wanted me to be able to cater to all the needs of the men they were going to send me to.\u201d\n\nMaxwell and Epstein allegedly ordered Giuffre to pay attention to what the men wanted, so she could report back to them. Giuffre said she traveled with Epstein from 1999 through the summer of 2002, to his homes in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Paris, France.\n\n\u201cI had sex with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex with,\u201d Giuffre stated. \u201cEpstein paid me for many of these sexual encounters. In fact, my only purpose for Epstein, Maxwell and their friends was to be used for sex.\u201d\n\nGiuffre added that \u201cEpstein had sex with underage girls on a daily basis\u201d and that his interest in minor girls was \u201cobvious\u201d to those in his orbit. His code word for this abuse was \u201cmassage,\u201d and Maxwell would often have sex with the victims, too, Giuffre claimed.\n\nMaxwell denied Giuffre\u2019s claims as early as 2011, after Giuffre gave an interview to the Daily Mail, releasing a statement that claimed \u201cthe allegations made against me are abhorrent and entirely untrue and I ask that they stop.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Maxwell called Giuffre\u2019s allegations \u201cobvious lies,\u201d and Giuffre filed a defamation suit against the socialite. The Miami Herald and other news outlets have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to unseal all pleadings in that case, which was settled in 2017. Paul Cassell, one of Giuffre\u2019s lawyers, told the court that if the records are made public, they \u201cwill show that Epstein and Maxwell were trafficking girls to the benefit of his friends, including Mr. Dershowitz.\u201d\n\nLast week, the court ordered the release of sealed documents in the case.\n\nEpstein allegedly forced Giuffre to have sex with Prince Andrew at least three times, including during an orgy. (The court filing includes a photo of \u201cAndy\u201d putting his arm around Giuffre\u2019s partially bare waist, while Maxwell smiles in the background.)\n\nGiuffre said she was also forced to have sex with another Epstein confidant, Jean Luc Brunel, who runs the MC2 modeling agency.\n\nBrunel supplied Epstein with girls as young as 12, luring aspiring models from poor countries or poor backgrounds to the United States, Giuffre alleged. \u201cJeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim,\u201d Giuffre stated. (Brunel, in a previous statement, denied being involved \u201cin the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of\u201d and said \u201cI have exercised with the utmost ethical standard for almost 40 years.\u201d)\n\nGiuffre said she finally escaped Epstein\u2019s abuse after he sent her to Thailand to learn Thai massage and to recruit another young girl for his alleged sex ring. Instead, Giuffre met her future husband and relocated to Australia.\n\nYears later, in 2011, two FBI agents from Florida visited Giuffre to discuss Epstein. In another declaration, Giuffre said the investigators \u201cseemed like they were being blocked from doing what they wanted to do\u2014which I thought was to arrest Epstein and his powerful friends for all their illegal sexual crimes.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Giuffre tried to contact the FBI again for an update on the Epstein investigation. \u201cI have never been able to figure out who was (and still is) stopping a prosecution,\u201d Giuffre stated in the declaration.\n\n\u201cBecause nothing is being done,\u201d Giuffre added, \u201cit makes me think that Epstein was right when he told me he had so many people in his pocket. Maybe those people are still helping him escape being prosecuted for what he did against me.\n\n\u201cThe justice system doesn\u2019t seem to respond to the victims in this case. It seems to favor those who have the most money and power and influence.\u201d", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein is being held at the federal lockup in Manhattan, according to law enforcement sources.", "authors": ["Pervaiz Shallwani", "Kate Briquelet", "Harry Siegel", "Senior Editor", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1561069009/190614-briquelet-epstein-tease_gkahqk", "published_at": "2019-07-06"}
