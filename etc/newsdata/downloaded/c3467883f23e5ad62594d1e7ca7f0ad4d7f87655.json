The FOX launch combined with bringing Cain Velasquez and Tyson Fury into WWE were major moves that are shaking things up.\u201d\n\nThe cable side is a shaping up to be a battle royale, as the WWE\u2019s Wednesday broadcasts of NXT on USA Network, are battling with the new All Elite Wrestling (AEW), which airs on TNT. Both shows air from 8 to 10 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n\u201cAll Elite Wrestling: Dynamite,\u201d from AEW, debuted to 1.409 million total viewers, besting USA Network\u2019s \u201cNXT,\u201d which posted 891,000 total viewers over the same two-hour period. \u201cDynamite\u201d had more than doubled its competition in the key adults 18-49 demographic, scoring 878,000 viewers compared to \u201cNXT\u2019s\u201d 414,000.\n\nThis week, \u201cDynamite\u201d suffered a significant drop to 1.018 million viewers, but it still came in a bit higher than the 790,000 viewers for \u201cNXT,\u201d which nearly doubled its viewers in one week.\n\n\"The big thing is that both companies and brands are motivated to give people the best matches possible because this is a battle of who is going to present the best matches with the best atmosphere\" - Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter\n\nThe reason that the numbers are there, as experts say, is that it is programming that draws in a specific audience.\n\n\u201cIt does well with young men, and advertisers want to reach them on television,\u201d media consultant Brad Adgate, who worked in the advertising industry. \u201cYou\u2019re getting them off of video games and watching YouTube, and you can get them in front of a TV set for an hour, that could be very financially lucrative because of who the target audience is. If you can get a man 12-to-24 or 12-to-34 watching that week in and week out, there\u2019s a long list of advertisers that want to reach them.\u201d\n\nAEW was founded this year, with backing from Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan \u2013 the lead investor of this endeavor - and his son Tony, who was named the founder, president and CEO of the company. Professional wrestlers Cody Rhodes, as well as Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson, who are known as The Elite are the promotion's inaugural contracted talents. The trio is serving as both in-ring performers and executive vice presidents alongside Kenny Omega, fellow professional wrestler and co-founder of The Elite.\n\n\u201cAEW and NXT are in a great battle every week,\u201d said Meltzer. \"The big thing is that both companies and brands are motivated to give people the best matches possible because this is a battle of who is going to present the best matches with the best atmosphere.\"\n\nThe big ratings numbers for the multiple WWE events and the upstart AEW show the past two weeks show one thing that could benefit both the established WWE and its challenger.\n\n\u201cAny time you have competition, it creates news around it, the phrase \u2018rising tide lifts all boats,\u2019 comes to mind,\u201d said Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at TVREV.\n\n\u201cWrestling\u2019s been having a comeback and, then, this new AEW, they seem to be getting the younger fans, that\u2019s (Khan\u2019s) goal. WWE, at some level, is still quite popular. Its audience may be older, but they\u2019re still watching it; they\u2019re not going anywhere. At its heyday, wresting had a much bigger audience (Saturday Night\u2019s Main Event drew an 11.6 rating in the 1980s on NBC), so clearly there\u2019s still room for growth.\u201d\n\nWhen the partnership between the AEW and TNT was announced, they took a veiled shot at the WWE, saying their brand mission would be to offer a product that\u2019s \"less scripted, soapy drama, and more athleticism and real sports analytics, bringing a legitimacy to wrestling...Wrestlers will also be given more freedom to explore their characters and highlight their athletic abilities.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe AEW also promised innovations such as \"introducing statistics to wrestling for the first time ever,\" which includes \"tracking each competitor's wins and losses as the wrestlers pursue championships, analyzing their moves, assessing damage to their opponents, and providing insights into their winning streaks.\"\n\nWWE\u2019s flagship show, \u201cRaw\u201d still airs on Monday nights \u2013 and it drew a 2.5 rating for its Sept. 30 broadcast - and it used to broadcast \u201cSmackDown\u201d as well before FOX swooped in with the huge deal.\n\n\u201cWWE\u2019s been around a long time, it\u2019s going to be hard for (AEW) to make any inroads,\u2019 says Adgate. \u201cIt could make a go of it, but it\u2019s going to take a while, invest in it, promote it, and get some talented people that will resonate with viewers. They can make a dent in it, but WWE\u2019s pretty long-running and established. They have a great heritage with it, but wrestling\u2019s wrestling.\u201d\n\nNXT started as a revamped feeder system, basically minor league wrestling promotion, for WWE. Their weekly series used to air on Wednesday nights on the streaming service, WWE Network. It was moved to USA when their drama series \u201cSuits\u201d ended its long run.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "WWE scored big in its debut on Fox, but it is facing a fresh challenge on cable TV.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/05/0/0/WWE-saudi-arabia-ap1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
