led by Liz Truss, is likely to lobby for the UK to \"accommodate\" US demands.\n\n\"Defra will come under significant pressure from DIT to accommodate the US's asks,\" it said. \"DIT are concerned about the ability for controversial SPS issues to help us negotiations [with the US].\"\n\nThe memo recommends that Defra \u201cpush back strongly\u201d against DIT pressure \u201cto secure our positions, particularly on dispute settlement, handling of custom terms and definitions, and around controversial issues (hormone beef, chlorine chicken)\u201d.\n\nAnd it points out that many areas of food regulation are devolved matters, meaning the UK's regional governments could effectively scupper the prospects of a deal with the US.\n\nIt was reported last week that Boris Johnson had scrapped plans for the UK to remain tied closely to EU standards after Brexit.\n\nHowever, his spokesman said on Monday: \"The government has been clear throughout that we have no plan to reduce any of our standards in this area.\"\n\nBut Barry Gardiner, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, said: \u201cA trade agreement with the USA risks opening the floodgates to food imports produced to much lower standards.\n\n\u201cTheir rules specify 'acceptable levels' of rat hairs in paprika, insect fragments in peanut butter, maggots in orange juice and rat droppings in ginger. The right level should be zero. Undercutting our farmers and food manufacturers like this would drive many of our producers out of business and put jobs at risk.\u201d", "description": "The international trade department will lobby for the UK to accept demands from\u00a0Donald Trump's administration for rules on food safety to be relaxed as part of\u00a0a post-Brexit\u00a0trade deal with the US, according to leaked Whitehall memo.
