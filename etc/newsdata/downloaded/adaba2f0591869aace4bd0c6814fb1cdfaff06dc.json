The stock fell by as much as 5.1% on Tuesday, erasing year-to-date gains that had exceeded 43% as recently as May.\n\nThe final push into negative territory came on Tuesday when the Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak \u2014 previously Wall Street's biggest Netflix bull \u2014 cut his price target considerably.\n\nIncreased competition among online streaming giants has weighed on Netflix shares this year.\n\nWatch Netflix trade live on Markets Insider.\n\nNetflix is officially in the red for 2019.\n\nShares of the streaming giant fell by as much as 5.1% on Tuesday, erasing year-to-date gains that had exceeded 43% as recently as May.\n\nThe final push into negative territory came after the Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak \u2014 formerly the biggest Netflix bull on Wall Street \u2014 lowered his price target on the company to $350 from $515.\n\nWlodarczak cited \"higher than forecast\" costs for TV content, as well as increased competition from media giants such as HBO, Hulu, and Apple.\n\nThe analyst singled out the recent $1 billion deal that AT&T's WarnerMedia reached for exclusive rights to \"The Big Bang Theory\" as an example of the premium that streamers are paying for exclusive content rights.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, he said, Netflix should also pick up spending and even potentially pressure its margins to keep its \"sizeable content lead on its peers,\" as well as increase the barrier to entry for competitors. That has Wlodarczak wary of how much the company's stock will be able to rise over the next year.\n\n\"While we left our subscriber forecasts mostly unchanged, we raised our medium term cost forecasts ultimately assuming an annual cash outlay on programming of $35B in '25 up from $30B previously,\" he wrote.\n\nThat $5 billion boost in spending is the reason for the \"sizeable\" 30% cut in his price target, he said.\n\nThe turning point\n\nNetflix's stock started its prolonged move lower in July after the company reported a rare contraction in US subscribers, as well as quarterly earnings that fell short of analysts' estimates. The company said the quarter's content slate drove less growth than expected and noted that subscriber growth was lower in regions with price increases.\n\nThe stock has also been dragged down by the streaming wars. Shares dipped by more than 3% at the start of the month when Apple announced that it would start its TV Plus streaming service at $5 a month, cheaper than Netflix's $9 monthly bill.\n\nWall Street analyst commentary has also gotten more cautious. Last week, shares slid by as much as 2.8% when an analyst at Bernstein said the company could fall further before bottoming out. Analysts at Barclays, Nomura Instinet, and KeyBanc Capital Markets have also expressed worry that the stock is overpriced and could continue to slide.\n\nBut many analysts are still positive on the stock \u2014 even those who have lowered price targets. Wlodarczak still rated the shares a \"buy,\" and analysts at Piper Jaffray recently said to buy while the stock is discounted. Credit Suisse has also said there are positives from Netflix, including app downloads and a full lineup of original content coming out.\n\nOf 45 analysts who cover Netflix, 31 recommended buying the stock, 10 said to hold, and only four said that now is the time to sell, according to Bloomberg data. The average 12-month price target is $378.98.\n\nIf Netflix is able to boost spending and maintain and grow subscribers, that could change investor views of the company for the better, Wlodarczak wrote.\n\n\"In our view solid subscriber growth (even with higher spend) could turn investor sentiment on a dime,\" he said.\n\nNetflix shares are down more than 4% year-to-date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Netflix is officially in the red for 2019.
