This age group is usually expected to be heading up the property ladder.\n\nWhile 9 per cent of people in that age group expect to trade up this year, whether renting or buying, 12 per cent say they will be downsizing.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cNot only does this mean an insecure and peripatetic lifestyle, but as rents rise, tenants may be forced to keep downsizing in order to keep a lid on costs \u2013 especially if they\u2019re simultaneously trying to save for a home themselves,\u201d says Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\u201cWhen they eventually buy, they may have to downsize again in some areas to get on to the property ladder, but the sooner people can save and buy a property of their own, the sooner they can take control.\u201d\n\nThe numbers say it all\n\nAnalysis carried out by the Resolution Foundation shows that in England there are just 825 homes for every 1,000 families in England.\n\nThe foundation argues that the rise in shared households, such as when young professionals live together or adults live with their parents, has happened out of necessity rather than choice, as there simply are not enough properties to go around.\n\nThe Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) recently reported that tenant demand continued to rise for a third successive month in March, while new landlord instructions slipped further.\n\nMeanwhile, data from the Office for National Statistics shows that rental prices paid by tenants in the UK rose by 1.2 per cent in the 12 months to March 2019. Between January 2015 and March 2019, private rental prices in the UK increased by 7.3 per cent.\n\nLast year, RICS warned that small scale landlords were pulling out of the market and reducing the supply of rental property. That could mean rents climb by as much as 15 per cent by 2023, it warned.\n\nIf that analysis is shown to be correct then even more young renters and aspiring homeowners may find they need to downsize either to save a deposit or simply afford their rent.\n\nA report from the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange last year revealed that there are 1.1 million homes in England with two or more spare bedrooms where a single person aged over 65 lives.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t more of this age group downsizing instead?\n\nBarriers to downsizing\n\nIf the cost of homes is one reason Generation Rent are so likely to downsize, the cost of moving is a barrier to many baby boomers.\n\nEarlier this month, Saga revealed that a quarter of older, would-be downsizers are put off moving because of barriers such as stamp duty.\n\nIts research suggested that 45 per cent of those over 50 would consider downsizing as an option to help fund their retirement. That\u2019s a substantial number of would-be downsizers \u2013 and yet younger people are still more likely to do it.\n\nAnd when over-50s do go smaller, they\u2019re not always pleased with the results. A report this week from financial services provider OneFamily showed that 20 per cent of over-60s who did downsize were disappointed by how much money they freed up by doing so.\n\nIn fact, the research showed that the average older downsizer ends up with just under \u00a3106,000 from the sale of their property, which is \u00a328,650 less than they expected. They\u2019re likely to tell their friends what a disappointment that was, reducing the attraction of downsizing for retired people.\n\nBut then, they are in a position to downsize in order to free up wealth, a very different situation from younger renters who do so to stretch their monthly income further.\n\nJeff Bromage, managing director of Saga Money, thinks that a stamp duty break for older downsizers might help them move, increasing liquidity in the market. A stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers has been in place since the 2017 Autumn Budget.\n\nMr Bromage said: \u201cIt was great that the government acted to help first time buyers, but this is only part of the solution. More needs to be done to help free up more family homes to the market in order to continue the supply of first homes.\u201d", "description": "Young people in the UK are four times more likely to be planning to downsize than those over the age of 55 \u2013 and it\u2019s much more likely to be about money than about giving up unnecessary space.
