As of Monday, three people have died, at least two first responders have been injured, 96 structures like homes and businesses have been destroyed and an additional 16 structures have been damaged. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) predicts the wildfire will not be fully contained until Nov. 7. Thousands have had to evacuate their homes throughout the state, and thousands more have been left without power as a result of precautionary outages.\n\nIn order to better visualize the Kincade wildfire, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) compiled images taken 5 minutes apart by the GOES-17 satellite and combined them into a short clip.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a striking animation,\u201d says Dan Lindsey, an atmospheric scientist and satellite expert at NOAA who provided the images. \u201cThis is just a way for people who are not there to visualize what it looks like from space, and it gives us a good idea of the spatial extent of the smoke.\u201d (The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued an air quality advisory on Friday as a result of heavy smoke that is expected to continue through Monday.)\n\nTODAY: NOAA's #GOES17, from 22,300 miles in space, captures the thick smoke plumes streaming from the massive #KincadeFire. @NWS: \"Potentially historic fire weather conditions expected in the northern Bay Area.\"\n\n#CaliforniaFires #CaWx #CAFireWX pic.twitter.com/u4Aqxwhr3k\n\n\u2014 NOAA Satellites - Public Affairs (@NOAASatellitePA) October 27, 2019\n\nSimilar satellite imagery captured the 46,000 wildfires that burned the Amazon rainforest in Brazil this summer, and wildfires that engulfed parts of the arctic in Siberia and Alaska in August. \u201cAt any given time you could probably look around the earth and find fires that are on the order of this big,\u201d Lindsey says. \u201cBut these are in California and relatively close to population centers\u2026 these are quite intense.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s California wildfires, which have totaled more than 5,800, have already engulfed more than 162,000 acres and killed three people. Although wildfires are a natural part of California\u2019s ecosystem, fire season has begun to start earlier and end later each year. \u201cClimate change is considered a key driver of this trend. Warmer spring and summer temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier spring snowmelt create longer and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more susceptible to severe wildfire,\u201d Cal Fire\u2019s website explains.\n\nMore satellite imagery can be seen on NOAA\u2019s website.", "description": "The Bay-area's Kincade wildfire has grown so large that a satellite can record the plumes from 23,000 miles away in space.", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IrYEUPELUDNc5GaqasXCRg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/06709984384e3ec535f47e9c48b603de", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
