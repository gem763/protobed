Further, TI faced a sharp drop in chip sales into communications infrastructure equipment, which is a notoriously lumpy end market. We will maintain our $106 fair value estimate for wide-moat TI. We still view the firm as a best-in-breed operator (regardless of cycles), but thought valuation appeared a bit frothy heading into the quarter. Even with shares down as much as 10% after hours, we'd still seek a wider margin of safety before investing.\n\nTI's revenue in the September quarter was $3.77 billion, up 3% sequentially but down 11% year-over-year and just below the midpoint of the firm's prior forecast of $3.65 billion-$3.95 billion as discussed in July. Broad-based chip demand was predictably weak due to U.S.-China trade tensions, while sales into communication equipment, which was one of the lone bright spots earlier in the year, were down 35% year-over-year and down 20% sequentially. Industrial and auto chip sales were each down a high single digit percentage year over year. Personal electronic, or PE, chip sales were also down year over year but up a midteens percentage sequentially, consistent with normal seasonal patterns. Gross margin rose 60 basis points sequentially and were down only 90 basis points year over year to 64.9%. EPS was $1.49 and beat Street expectations, but mostly due to a discrete tax benefit.\n\nFor the December quarter, TI expects revenue in the range of $3.07 billion-$3.33 billion which, at the midpoint, represents declines of 15% sequentially and 14% year over year. TI's guidance is notably worse than seasonal patterns, as the firm's fourth-quarter sequential decline has averaged 8.5% over the past five years.", "description": "We'd seek a wider margin of safety before investing in this wide-moat firm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt6e5cd6b9105e2587/5c76b9c9f6d704c65fb2bfc6/BrianColello_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
