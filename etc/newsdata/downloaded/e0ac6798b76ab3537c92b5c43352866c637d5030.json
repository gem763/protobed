It also combines elements of Renaissance and Baroque styles.\n\nThe castle's surroundings also influenced its appearance. It is situated in an area with a history of cultures clashing, but also uniting.\n\nIt was originally built to protect the area from external enemies, such as Crimean Tatars, however it was later owned by the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family, who used it for hunting and entertaining high-profile guests.\n\nThe fortress was left abandoned for nearly a century after it was seriously damaged during the Battle of Mir in 1812, and later belonged to Poland between 1921 and 1939.\n\nLater, in 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the castle was used as a ghetto, where around 800 Jews were imprisoned.\n\nAfter Belarus was liberated in 1944, local people whose homes had been destroyed sought refuge within the castle. The last family to live there moved out in 1962, and more than twenty years later, work began on restoring the structure.\n\nAll of these historical events left their mark on Mir Castle, leaving it a fusion of archetectural designs from different eras and cultures.\n\nKira Rusan, a tour guide at the site, said: \"The castle combines elements that, at first glance, seem to be completely incompatible and that's what makes it so unique. In 2000 our castle was included in the World Heritage List by UNESCO, and it was a great honour for us.\"\n\nToday, the castle is open to the public, as a living testament to Belarus\u2019 turbulent history.", "description": "In the heart of Belarus, there lies a castle of truly unique architectural design.", "authors": ["Alfie Tobutt"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/89/03/98/1000x563_cmsv2_c3e99475-e7db-5f40-a170-d08fe2effedf-3890398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
