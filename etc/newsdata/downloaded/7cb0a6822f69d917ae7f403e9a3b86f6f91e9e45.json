The job was then contracted out three more times -- with the pot of cash dwindling each time -- until a fifth man, Ling Xiansi, was offered $14,000 to kill Wei in 2014.\n\nInstead of killing Wei, Ling wrote him a note asking him to meet at a coffee shop.\n\n\u201cFor just 100,000 yuan, I don\u2019t want to kill you, but you have to cooperate with me,\" he said, according to the British publication.\n\nThe pair staged Wei's death and took photos of him gagged and bound. Wei disappeared for around 10 days and then went to the police, the Nanning Intermediate People's Court said on its website.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nQin and the contract killers were brought to trial in 2016 but acquitted, a rarity for a country with a 99.9 percent conviction rate, the Guardian said.\n\nProsecutors appealed and the second trial lasted three years. The men were given sentences ranging from two years and seven months to five years in prison.\n\nIn a statement, the court said the men deliberately deprived \u201cothers of their livelihood, with actions that constituted the crime of intentional homicide.\u201d", "description": "A group of six reluctant hitmen were jailed last week in China after a years-long saga\u00a0in which they alleged\u00a0subcontracted\u00a0the hit several times.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/China.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
