(Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)\n\nWashington Nationals Manager Dave Martinez left Sunday\u2019s win over the Atlanta Braves in the sixth inning because he wasn\u2019t feeling well. The team\u2019s training staff decided it would be best for Martinez to leave Nationals Park and get checked out at a hospital. Martinez is still expected to be in St. Louis on Monday when the Nationals open a three-game series against the Cardinals, but it was not immediately clear whether he would take the team\u2019s charter flight Sunday evening.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t feeling good, so just for precautionary reasons they took him to the hospital just to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d said bench coach Chip Hale, who managed the rest of Sunday\u2019s 7-0 victory in Martinez\u2019s place. \u201cBut we\u2019re expecting everything will be good.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals declined to provide further specifics on Martinez\u2019s illness. It was not particularly hot Sunday \u2014 88 degrees at first pitch \u2014 and Martinez conducted a pregame news conference at 11:30 a.m., about two hours before the game. This has been a trying weekend for him in some ways, after his approach to a scary situation was heavily questioned when Braves outfielder Charlie Culberson was hit in the face by a pitch Saturday night. Martinez was visibly emotional while addressing reporters Saturday, and he reaffirmed his stance on the matter before the Nationals took the series finale.\n\nThen Martinez was absent from the dugout for the final four or so innings Sunday. The top step of the dugout, where he typically stands, was empty aside from his coaches cycling through the spot. Hale handled the manager\u2019s postgame interview for the second consecutive Sunday \u2014 the first time was after Martinez was ejected in Atlanta \u2014 and now the team hopes Martinez is back as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cAll you can worry about is hopefully he\u2019s doing great,\u201d veteran infielder Howie Kendrick said. \u201cI wish him the best. I love Davey. We talk pretty much every day. He\u2019s got a lot of insight and I\u2019ve known him for years, playing against him in the American league, too. He\u2019s done a great job this year.\n\n\u201cI wish him the best right now and, like I said, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on but hopefully it\u2019s nothing major.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAn MLB player suffered facial fractures after being hit.
