Salesforce forecast that Black Friday alone will bring in $7.3 billion in the U.S., and $39.6 billion globally. Cyber Monday is expected to inch past that revenue, bringing in $8.2 billion.\n\nOne unexpected victor from the shortened season will be so-called \u201cclick and collect\u201d stores, or retailers that offer consumers the ability to purchase an item online and then pick it up in person. Garf estimated those types of retailers could see a 28 percent boost in sales, year over year.\n\n\u201cConsumers don\u2019t realize the shortened time period,\u201d Garf said. \u201cSo what happens is consumers will wake up form their cyber week hangover ready to shop, but realize that there are fewer days before the magical shipping cut-off window closes, around Dec. 14 to 15. For those retailers that don\u2019t offer click-and-collect, they are not going to get the product there in time.\u201d\n\nThe holiday season will arrive in the shadow of President Trump\u2019s 15-month-long trade war with China, which has resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.\n\nIn August, despite Trump\u2019s decision to delay some tariffs until Dec. 15, after the critical holiday shopping period ends, the CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association warned the tariffs will affect 91 percent of the retail apparel industry and will be the \u201ccoal in the stockings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re begging the administration. We\u2019ve been begging them for months, \u2018don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t hurt the consumer,\u2019\u201d Rick Helfenbein said. \u201cWe can live with this economy a little bit longer.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Shoppers have six fewer days between Cyber Week and Christmas to make their purchases.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/image-2.png?ve=1&tl=1"}
