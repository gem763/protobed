That's according to a recent survey regarding public cloud adoption conducted by Refinitiv and shared with Business Insider of 300 C-level and senior technologists at a wide range of financial firms.\n\nPublic cloud investment will make up roughly 48% of firm's IT budgets, indicating Wall Street's intention to continue to put more resources into the tech. That's up from 41% of tech budgets this year, according to the survey, and only 34% of budgets in 2018.\n\nThe average proportion of financial firms' tech budgets spent on the public cloud has steadily increased over the past three years. Refinitiv Wall Street has good reason to increase the time and money spent on moving off physical servers and out of local databases and onto the public cloud.\n\nFor starters, financial firms have seen big savings from making the switch. For those who completed public cloud projects, 76% of respondents said doing so led to immediate cost reductions that were \"better than expected.\"\n\nRead more: Wall Street is finally willing to go to Amazon's, Google's, or Microsoft's cloud, but nobody can agree on the best way to do it: 'If you pick a favorite and you're wrong, you're fired'\n\nBut moving to the public cloud isn't just about saving money. Taking tools and data \"off premise\" \u2014 out of physical servers \u2014 allows firms to innovate and experiment faster and cheaper than before. More than half the respondents said public cloud projects they completed allowed them to accelerate their time to market and lower their cost of experimentation \"better than expected.\"\n\nThe ability to innovate quickly is a major consideration of big banks in particular, as they look to fend off smaller, more agile startups that continue to creep into the space.\n\nA large portion of firms that have already completed public cloud projects said they saw \"better than expected\" reduction in their costs. Refinitiv\n\nHowever, for all the benefits the public cloud offers firms, there are still issues holding them back. One of the biggest is uncertainty around regulatory requirements. Only 6% of respondents said their organizations weren't limiting the use of the public cloud in some way because of regulatory concerns.\n\nSome said regulators requiring certain data to stay put on physical servers limited them, while others pointed to rules around having to use multiple public cloud providers for resiliency purposes, which some banks have struggled to do.\n\nBut where regulators are proving most difficult is in their lack of consistency, respondents said. Rules differ across jurisdictions, making it tough for a firm to create a global public cloud program.\n\nSee more: Bank of America is putting the finishing touches on a 7-year cloud journey its CTO says has saved the bank billions and improved customer interactions\n\nA majority of respondents also cited short-term targets, pointing to the potential impact the new tech would have on revenue, as another barrier to investing more into the public cloud. Concerns over compatibility with security tools was also a commonly cited reason by respondents for limiting further investment.\n\nSecurity in the public cloud is one of the biggest reasons Wall Street firms have pointed to in the past as a reason they've resisted moving off physical servers.\n\n\"Larger clients have not necessarily seen the greatest improvements from cloud in the security area,\" said Gavin Carey, head of enterprise in EMEA at Refinitiv, in the report.", "description": "A recent survey conducted by Refinitiv found that financial firms plan to spend 48% of tech budget on the public cloud in 2020, a 7% uptick from 2019.", "authors": ["Dan Defrancesco"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ca7684fc6cc501cff0f8b54-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
