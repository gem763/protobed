Turkey did not announce any plans to withdraw its own forces at that time.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday vowed to crush any Kurdish militia units that do not pull back from the safe zone. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) accused Turkey of violating the ceasefire and launching a major offensive against three villages.\n\nErdogan railed against Western leaders for refusing to listen to Turkey\u2019s concerns about Syrian Kurdish forces working with the PKK separatist organization in Turkey over the past four years, leaving Turkey with no choice but to use unilateral military force.\n\n\u201cWe receive with a bitter smile the attempt of those who are responsible for the deaths of 50 million people in World War II to give us a lesson of humanity,\u201d he sneered in response to complaints about the Turkish invasion of Syria.\n\n\u201cFor democracy, rule of law and human rights, I invite the whole world to see, accept and take a position. YPG/PKK is as dangerous a terrorist organization as Daesh,\u201d he declared. \u201cDaesh\u201d is another name for the Islamic State or ISIS.\n\nErdogan repeated his claim that the Syrian \u201csafe zone\u201d will not only protect Turkey from Kurdish militants but will also give some two million Syrian refugees an opportunity to return to their homeland. At least one Syrian opposition leader, Syrian Forum CEO Ghassan Hitto, agreed on Thursday that both the current and previous Turkish incursions into Syria have created opportunities for refugees to return.\n\n\u201cI use Turkish statistics for the Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations, and since then, about 350,000 Syrians have returned to Syria. Because when Turkey comes in \u2013 this is a fact \u2013 they invest somewhat in the infrastructure in terms of roads, communications, and these are all required tools for an early recovery,\u201d said Hitto, referring to two earlier Turkish military operations in Syria.\n\nThe European Parliament (EP) voted on Thursday to condemn the Turkish invasion and recommended sanctions against Turkey. The resolution blamed Turkey for a \u201chigh number of civilian and military casualties,\u201d along with at least 300,000 displaced civilians, and \u201cfirmly rejected\u201d the Turkish-Russian agreement to establish a safe zone.\n\nThe EP accused Erdogan of \u201cweaponizing\u201d refugees and using them to \u201cblackmail the European Union\u201d with his periodic threats to open the gates for a new flood of Syrians into Europe. They also expressed concern over \u201creports that hundreds of ISIS prisoners are escaping from camps in northern Syria amid the Turkish offensive, which increases the risk of a resurgence of the terrorist group.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry lashed out at the European Parliament after the vote and \u201cabsolutely rejected\u201d the resolution.\n\n\u201cWe are not surprised by this decision taken by a Parliament constantly hosting terrorists,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.\n\n\u201cThe EP, which despite all our explanations adopted a decision inconsistent with the facts, pressed on with its biased attitude toward Turkey lacking common sense. The decision shows that the EP cannot properly follow important developments in the regional and global arena, objectively evaluate causes and consequences, and develop sound and relevant strategies,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Turkish statement insisted the Europeans should be grateful to Turkey for acting to \u201celiminate a terror threat, secure Syria\u2019s territorial integrity, prevent more illegal migration, and ensure the safe return of Syrian refugees to their homeland.\u201d\n\nTurkish media noted U.S. Secretary of Defense Mike Esper\u2019s statement on Thursday that the United States never promised to help the Syrian Kurds establish an autonomous state.\n\n\u201cOur partnership with the SDF, which was a very good one and still is a good one by the way, was about defeating ISIS. By March of 19, 2019, we clearly destroyed the physical caliphate of ISIS. Our commitment to the Kurds was not to help them establish an autonomous Kurdish state and defend them against Turkey. And that\u2019s just the cold hard facts,\u201d Esper said.\n\nThe secretary of defense said the small deployment of U.S. soldiers in northeastern Syria was withdrawn after it was \u201cmade very clear to us\u201d that Turkey would invade regardless of their presence.\n\n\u201cI was not about to put less than 50 U.S. soldiers in between a 15,000-man-plus Turkish army preceded by Turkish militia and jeopardize the lives of those servicemen, nor was I about to start a fight with a NATO ally,\u201d he explained.\n\nEsper nevertheless strongly criticized Turkey for putting the U.S. and NATO in a \u201cvery terrible situation\u201d with its \u201cunwarranted\u201d invasion and warned Turkey is \u201cheading in the wrong direction\u201d and \u201cspinning closer into Russia\u2019s orbit\u201d as events unfold.", "description": "The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday there is no fixed timetable for Turkish troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1169173953-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
