Pronounced bass, like Lance Bass. (Image: Cartoon Netwok)\n\nWhile Steven Universe: The Movie\u2019s very much a story about the Crystal Gems\u2019 future, it spends a fair amount of time exploring the Gems\u2019 pasts in a novel way that makes you appreciate how far everyone\u2019s come. The movie introduces some rather interesting new aspects of all the Gems\u2019 personalities, Pearl in particular.\n\nDeedee Magno Hall\u2019s Pearl has always been extra to a fault (in a good way), so it\u2019s hardly surprising that she ends up being one of the movie\u2019s brighter spots. But when you actually take a moment to think about Pearl\u2019s songs featured in the movie, you realise that the character\u2019s arc has a significance that\u2019s larger than her specific experience.\n\nSteven Universe: The Movie sets basically all of it heroes back to their original, most basic selves after Spinel hits Ruby, Sapphire, Pearl and Amethyst with her Rejuvenator weapon.\n\nAs Bismuth explains, the Rejuvenator was a tool used by the Diamond Authority, and while it doesn\u2019t exactly destroy Gems, it does revert them to their original physical and psychological forms \u2014 a hard reset. The Diamonds used it at some point in the past to control any unruly Gems.\n\nAfter taking a bunch of direct hits, all of the Crystal Gems end up poofed, which has happened before, but the weapon\u2019s energy means that when they come back they have no memory of who they were. Steven figures out a way to bring them all back gradually over the course of the movie, but we get to see some nifty things about what the Gems were like in their most elementary forms along the way.\n\nPearl rebooting. (Image: Cartoon Network Studios)\n\nWhen it\u2019s Pearl\u2019s turn to come back, what you see is that Pearls (or at the very least this Pearl) didn\u2019t begin as a fully actualised Gem with an identity. When Pearl begins to reform, the first thing Steven and Greg are presented with is a cartoonish clamshell, a nod to one of the ways to harvest actual pearls \u2014 which makes them start asking questions.\n\nWhat neither Steven nor Greg quite get is that Pearl, in her elementary form, is programmed to mould herself according to the desires of whichever person owns and/or activates her gem for the first time.\n\nSteven Universe had already insinuated that Pearls were unique within Gem culture because of the way they\u2019re regarded and treated as objects in ways that other Gems simply aren\u2019t.\n\nYou understand that Pearls are people just as much as Amethyst or Peridot but within the Homeworld Gem hierarchy, Pearls were categorised as being... well, things. Everything about Pearl\u2019s new introductory song \u201csystem/BOOT. PearlFinal (3).Info\u201d feels as if it was cribbed from an internal Apple video from a few years back before the company gave up on tacky skeuomorphism.\n\nOut of context, this depiction of Pearl might not have been all that fascinating, but because the movie shows you how a number of different Gems apparently got their starts, Pearl\u2019s is uniquely interesting because she\u2019s seemingly designed to be an advice tool as well as a person.\n\nLater in the film, you\u2019re introduced to proto-Amethyst who, like Pearl, is simpler, but she\u2019s able to manifest outside of her gem without needing to be told what kind of person to be. To be fair, she doesn\u2019t know what kind of person she wants to be, but the fact that she isn\u2019t given a clear directive is interesting in and of itself, because the implication is that Amethysts aren\u2019t meant to be told who to be quite as explicitly as Pearls.\n\nBy establishing how Pearl, like all Pearls presumably, was created to be an assistant and stan for her owners, Steven Universe: The Movie adds a new layer of complexity to the character\u2019s larger journey because it makes her ultimate rebellion feel that much more substantial.\n\nIronically, the movie gives you the distinct sense that Pink Diamond was never really in control as much as she might have thought herself to be, and that she would have been inclined to take cues from the people around her as she figured out what kind of presence she wanted to establish on Earth. Pearl began as a follower, but with time, a bit of guidance, and space, she was able to come into her own in a way that would have made Pink proud.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be interesting to see should Steven Universe continue is whether the series ends up doing anything with this weird facet of Pearl\u2019s origins, because it\u2019s ripe with opportunity for storytelling that fleshes out more of the Gems\u2019 culture.\n\nWe\u2019ve always known that the Gems were, you know, weird, but to see that weirdness borne out in these kinds of eccentric ways is thrilling, and only makes you want to see more of it given the space to shine on the small screen.", "description": "While Steven Universe: The Movie\u2019s very much a story about the Crystal Gems\u2019 future, it spends a fair amount of time exploring the Gems\u2019 pasts in a novel way that makes you appreciate how far everyone\u2019s come.
