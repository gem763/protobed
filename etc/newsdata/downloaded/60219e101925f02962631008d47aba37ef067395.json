Melissa Lonner, a former Today show booker, told Farrow about her own encounter with Lauer, in which he exposed himself to her without her consent. In the book, Lonner alleges that Lauer asked her to step away from a company party in 2010 under the guise of a business matter. Once alone, he made small talk, then unzipped his pants to reveal his erect penis. Lauer\u2019s attorney refutes this in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cMatt never exposed himself to anyone,\u201d reads part of the statement. \u201cThis ridiculous story has been shopped around for years. Many allegations that are being circulated were never raised during any fact-checking process.\u201d\n\nThe day after the incident with Lauer, Lonner told Farrow she\u2019d spoken to Ann Curry. Lonner was afraid of making a formal complaint, but Curry said she told two senior managers but did not share which two. Upon leaving NBC News in 2013, Lonner was offered \u201ca six-figure sum in exchange for signing a release of rights,\u201d according to Farrow. It prevents her from filing a legal claim against the company. In 2018, Lonner says NBC contacted her attorney to stress the \u201cenforceability of her pact.\u201d NBC told THR the call was a response to \u201ca query from Lonner\u2019s attorney.\u201d The network also denies that Lonner raised any claims about Lauer and says the separation agreement was not intended to keep her quiet.\n\nNBC News president Noah Oppenheimer denied Farrow\u2019s claim that NBC higher-ups knew about Lauer\u2019s conduct before Brooke Nevils\u2019s 2017 complaint in a staff-wide memo obtained by \u201cPage Six.\u201d \u201cAt the time of the employee\u2019s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer, was paid 22 weeks of severance based on her years of service, and was asked to sign a separation agreement that was standard for departing employees at the time,\u201d Oppenheimer wrote about Lonner. \u201cThe standard separation agreement included a routine confidentiality clause that was designed to protect proprietary company information.\u201d\n\nA rep for Farrow told THR, \u201cWe stand by the reporting in the book 100 percent and believe that it discredits this attempt by NBC to rewrite the facts.\u201d", "description": "Melissa Lonner, a former \u2018Today\u2019 show booker, accuses Matt Lauer of sexual misconduct in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book, \u2018Catch and Kill.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-matt-lauer-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
