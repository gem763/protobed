Danias confirmed it was about to launch the property's leasing campaign.\n\n\"Our vision is for a vibrant, mixed-use precinct with a mix of new housing, and increased employment supporting new start-up and creative industries,\" Danias head of property Angelo Mantsis said.\n\n\"Rich St is a modern campus commercial development that will attract businesses that are being priced out of the CBD or businesses which need a bit more space to grow.\"\n\nRich St will be the flagship commercial hub of Marrickville's Victoria Road Precinct.\n\nThe attractiveness of the precinct draws from its proximity to the future Sydney Metro station at Sydenham which will enable commuters to get to Sydney's Pitt Street in less than 10 minutes. A bit further away, the Sydney Metro station in Marrickville will also facilitate a quick trip for commuters.\n\nThe rise of development around or over Sydney Metro stations leads the next wave of inner-city development for Sydney, offering developers access to scarce prime sites.\n\nMirvac and John Holland are tipped to win the over-station housing and commercial tender for the Waterloo station. Grocon and Oxford Properties also recently won the Pitt Street over-station development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanias, as the largest landholder in Marrickville's Victoria Road Precinct, spearheaded a planning proposal to rezone mainly industrial sites in the area into mixed-use land. The proposal was approved in late 2017.\n\nRich St, a 13,000sq m campus-style complex, aims to attract businesses that are being priced out of the Sydney CBD.\n\nAs a result, the 18-hectare precinct bounded by Addison Road, Fitzroy Street and Sydenham Road, with Victoria Road running through it, will now be able to yield a 1100 new apartments including affordable housing.\n\nThe precinct, seven kilometres from the CBD, could yield $2 billion in housing and commercial developments.\n\nStrong housing demand in the area will guarantee its success, particularly for apartment sales.\n\n\"Marrickville is going through a revival. People are searching the area,\" Mr Mantsis said.\n\n\"As evidence, just look at the recent sales activity in Marrickville. A record local price was set last week, prices are up and Marrickville is regularly rating in the top 10 property searches. There is a also a shortage of new supply.\"\n\nDanias is also planning other projects in the precinct including an innovative high-tech manufacturing complex.", "description": "New apartment project to launch residential development in the Victoria Road Precinct of Marrickville, which is emerging as Sydney's \"metro\" suburb.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5147%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_92/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c7a670fffc86cd00ca2df3ae5a2b39f87bb0899e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
