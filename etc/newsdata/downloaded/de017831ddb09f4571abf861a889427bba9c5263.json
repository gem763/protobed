Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBut big-hitting Matteo Berrettini put himself into that conversation on Wednesday with a gritty, workmanlike effort that no doubt earned the approval of his Italian countrymen, battling past 13th seeded Frenchman Gael Monfils 3-6 6-3 6-2 3-6 7-6(5) to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final.\n\nIf Federer is tennis\u2019s version of a sleek Ferrari then Berrettini is the big-engine muscle car.\n\nStanding six-foot, five-inches (1.98m) with a scruffy beard Berrettini cuts an imposing figure, a Rocky-like underdog who packs a similar punch as the fictional boxer and is now one win away from a shot at the title.\n\n\u201cI was dreaming about this when I was a child,\u201d grinned Berrettini. \u201cSo now I\u2019m doing that.\n\n\u201cI have to enjoy what I\u2019m doing but I have to look forward what to do, what I want to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in semis. I\u2019m trying to keep going and I\u2019m dreaming, as well.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nFour years ago Berrettini was playing a Futures event in Italy and on Wednesday became the first Italian man since Corrado Barazzutti 42 years ago to reach the U.S. Open semi-finals.\n\nBerrettini, who had never made it beyond the fourth round of any Grand Slam before, has ventured into uncharted territory but what the ceiling is for the big Italian not even long time coach Vincenzo Santopadre could offer a guess.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what are his limits because he\u2019s still going up, up, up,\u201d said Santopadre. \u201cSo it\u2019s difficult to say where he can arrive, what he can reach because I think nobody knows because he\u2019s so young and he continues growing.\n\nDespite winning a pair of titles this year and sitting a respectable 25th in the world rankings Berrettini was not on anyone\u2019s Flushing Meadows radar.\n\nA lack of consistent performances have plagued the 23-year-old\u2019s progress but the potential is clear.\n\nOffsetting a fourth round a appearance at Wimbledon and U.S. Open semi-final are a string of first round flops that have included the Australian Open, Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati.\n\nWhile Berrettini possesses all the physical tools, there is still work to be done on his mental game and he\u2019s talking to his mental coach every day at the year\u2019s final Grand Slam.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nAlso part of Berrettini\u2019s team in New York is Giovanni Bartocci - the owner of a trattoria in the East Village where he goes for the pasta dinners that have fueled his run to the last four.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s from Rome, my city,\u201d smiled Berrettini. \u201cI knew him last year. He\u2019s such a nice guy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always cheering for Italians. I mean, I\u2019m the only one left, so now he\u2019s cheering for me.\u201d", "description": "There has been no shortage of talk at the U.S. Open about where the challenge to the domination of the Big Three of Novak Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer might come from and none of it included a burly 23-year-old pasta-loving Roman.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426398180&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8408S", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
