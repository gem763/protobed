Nokia shares are down 30% this year.\n\nNokia reshuffled its management a year ago, replacing former head of mobile networks Marc Rouanne with Tommi Uitto, a Finn described by the company as an \"expert in radio technologies\".\n\n\"Roughly a year ago I made a change in the networks unit's leadership. With that I wanted to ensure that we have the right understanding and aim on how we will proceed with 5G. I am convinced that we now have it,\" Nokia's chief executive Rajeev Suri wrote in an emailed statement to the paper.\n\nNokia's key customers in its biggest 5G market - North America - have limited their spending due to proposed mergers.\n\nLast week, Nokia warned about losses from mergers such as T-Mobile US Inc's proposed $26.5 billion tie-up with Sprint Corp, which in October won formal approval from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nNokia is a key supplier to both telecoms companies, which have slowed spending as their potential merger faces court challenges.\n\nNokia's performance is in sharp contrast with that of its Swedish rival Ericsson which last week beat quarterly earnings expectations and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020.\n\n($1 = 0.8995 euros) (Reporting by Anne Kauranen Editing by David Holmes and Deepa Babington)", "description": "HELSINKI, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Telecom network equipment maker  Nokia has hired hundreds of engineers in Finland this  year to speed up its 5G development, the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
