Here's what that means \u2014 and 11 types of sexualities", "language": "en", "text": "Sexual identity is, according to sexuality educator, writer, and consultant Jamie LeClaire, the \"gender that you are attracted to, or if you are interested in sex at all.\"\n\nBeyond heterosexual and gay, there's a wide variety of sexual identities and terms people may identify with.\n\nSexual identity itself is a relatively new construct historically \u2014 and it's a contentious subject with some scholars.

Ronson told Rolling Stone he identifies as heterosexual.\n\nJamie LeClaire, a sexuality educator, writer, and consultant, told Business Insider that they do not consider sapiosexual a sexual identity.\n\n\"It's basically just a preference for smart people, and I don't really identify with that being a sexual orientation,\" LeClaire said.\n\nRather, he broadly defined sexual identity, or orientation, as the \"gender that you are attracted to, or if you are interested in sex at all.\"\n\nIn the United States, the LGBT population \u2014 and the mainstream acceptance of this community \u2014 is only growing. Gallup estimated that the percentage of Americans who identify as LGBT was 4.5% in 2017, while 8.1% of millennials self-identified as LGBT.\n\nThis rising awareness, coupled with the reach of social media and ever-increasing visibility, has led to more mainstream recognition of different sexual identities. For instance, sexual identities that are widely known are heterosexual, often known as straight, or gay.\n\nBut even within those categories there's a variety of different terms people identify with.\n\nRead more: These 2 maps show where America's LGBT families are thriving", "description": "Experts say there's a slew of terms that encompass a whole range of sexual identities beyond just \"gay\" and \"straight.\" Check out what they are.", "authors": ["Juliana Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e7d0b2e22af047a79b491?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
