I had ordered a fried chicken sandwich at Pine State Biscuits in Portland, Ore., and a friend chided me for not tacking on a gratuity to my credit card payment. I hadn\u2019t even considered it.\n\n\u201c They\u2019re working hard back there! They\u2019re getting paid so little! \"\n\n\u201c But I\u2019m just ordering at the counter! I always tip waiters well, but this is not a waiter! I\u2019m not a terrible person! \u201d\n\nI lost the argument, and ended up going back to leave a cash tip.\n\nTurns out, I\u2019m not alone. As small, independently owned cafes, smoothie bars and fast-casual restaurants in the United States have adopted customer-facing touch-screen payment systems in recent years \u2014 and as credit cards have replaced cash for even the smallest purchases \u2014 Americans and (heaven help them) foreign visitors have been confronted with a new kind of tipping. Point-of-sale systems, with touch screens asking you whether you\u2019d like to tip $1, $2 or $3 for that latte or 15, 20 or 25 percent for a salad, have been spreading like an infectious disease \u2014 or an infectious new dance craze, depending on your perspective.\n\n(Tipping via credit card is nonexistent or at least much less common at large chains like McDonald\u2019s and Burger King. Starbucks, though, allows tipping when customers order through their app and managers are free to put out a tip jar, said a spokes woman.)", "description": "Those customer-facing, touch-screen payment systems in restaurants are confounding customers in the U.S. and beyond.", "authors": ["Seth Kugel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/travel/15tipping/00tipping-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
