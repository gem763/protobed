Mike Huckabee, Sanders is also reportedly considering a run for governor in her home state in 2022.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sarah Sanders book: Ex Trump press secretary won't write tell-all", "description": "Sanders' yet-to-be-titled book is scheduled for publication in the fall of 2020 \u2013 presumably right before the general election.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IlWopnXd_bMvYGJbTPLbRA--~B/aD0yMjQ1O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/1807d9ae9a143cd095ded80aaab27621", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
