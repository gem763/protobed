Now, thanks to the \"sugar daddy\" dating website SeekingArrangement.com, she's the one getting served. \"I can go on a date, I can have steak and lobster, be gone for three hours after my kids are already asleep and come home with $500,\" she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nThe allowance-based dating site that the Nevada teacher came across in 2018 advertises itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest Sugar Daddy dating site,\u201d where it sets people up with \u201cmutually beneficial relationships.\u201d Dates can range from a single dinner out to a weekend trip (or longer), with payment being determined between the two parties \u2013 the sugar daddy and the sugar baby. SeekingArrangement makes it clear that it \u201cprohibits any unlawful use of the site, including escorting, prostitution and human trafficking.\u201d However, at least two of those interviewed by Yahoo Lifestyle say they had sex. Both women clarified that this was the result of a longterm relationship that had formed, not simply something transactional. \"That is something that was built over our time together and based on chemistry and our relationship,\" says one.\n\nWhile it might not seem like the most acceptable side hustle for an educator, it\u2019s likely among the most lucrative. The average sugar baby makes an estimated $2800 monthly from their \u201cdaddies,\u201d SeekingArrangement reported at the organization\u2019s 2018 summit. Those who rely on an extra salary as a way to make ends meet are far from alone. According to EdWeek, one in five teachers have at least one extra job to supplement their income \u2014 and most of them aren\u2019t glamorous. In fact, Nolah \u2014 who, like several others quoted in this story, asked to be identified with a pseudonym \u2014 says plenty of teachers in her area work as Uber drivers or cocktail servers at the Golden Nugget and Hooters.\n\nBut now, SeekingArrangement offers an alternative that has more than 10,000 teachers (according to the site) cashing in out of necessity. \u201cI mean I knew that I wasn\u2019t gonna be a billionaire off of being an educator, that\u2019s obvious. But I never thought that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to pay my basic bills,\u201d she says. \u201cI never thought that I would need that or have to really depend on other people for that. I mean, I have a masters degree.\u201d\n\nA current professor from Arizona, Lisa (not her real name), started her teaching career in an elementary school before deciding to pursue a PhD so she could move into a more lucrative position in academia. But her first full-time offer after getting her degree was \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like you do all that work, and you start out at $33,000,\u201d Lisa tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d The salary wasn\u2019t enough to make ends meet, so Lisa took on two additional jobs, working at a community college and bartending.\n\nIt was at the bar, one night, that a few men who stopped in for a drink mentioned SeekingArrangement. \u201cI was afraid that it was like prostitution,\u201d Lisa admits. Still, intrigued, she set up a profile and found older men that were mutually interested in a relationship. \u201cThey all had money,\u201d she adds, \u201cand they were just like, \u2018I want to share what I have.\u2019\u201d\n\nLisa says her arrangements are usually longterm, meaning she often gets an \u201callowance\u201d on a regular basis. \u201cGetting paid seems so strange to say,\u201d she admits. \u201cOne person paid my rent, another person contributed to my film project. The one guy I dated for a long time, he gave me a certain amount every week.\u201d\n\nNolah, on the other hand, makes her money from one-off dates where she typically accepts a certain rate. \u201cI have my own personal minimum that I will take for my time, and that\u2019s just me personally because that\u2019s not worth it for me to get my hair all pretty and put clothes on and leave my house for a hundred bucks. I\u2019m not doing that,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been gifted anywhere from $300 to $10,000. So it just depends on what our arrangement is and what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAnother sugar baby Aleecia (who has chosen to use her real name) tells Yahoo Lifestyle that she joined SeekingArrangement to support her low salary as a preschool teacher. The role proved so lucrative that she quit her job and began relying solely on paid dates \u2014 before starting a job as a health care worker. As much as she enjoys the site, she admits that she sometimes feels uncomfortable with the amount that some men have been willing to pay.", "description": "Teachers are becoming \"sugar babies\" to supplement their educator salaries, instead of taking on extra jobs.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5cJ7eHlFcX7kPkmCgrugyA--~B/aD0xNTEyO3c9MjgwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/56ceec90-e393-11e9-a7ff-750af4880e61", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
