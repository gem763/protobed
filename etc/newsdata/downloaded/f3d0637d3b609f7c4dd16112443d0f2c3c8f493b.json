With more than 100 component companies set to report quarterly earnings this week, hopes are running high that better-than-expected results will help push the blue-chip index past its prior peak.\n\nInvestors were broadly bearish heading into this earnings season given factors including the overhang of the trade war, global slowdown and lapping of early 2018\u2019s cut to the corporate tax rate. Most investors anticipated aggregate S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) would decline by about 4% over last year.\n\nSo far, however, results have not been as soft as feared.\n\nAs of Monday morning, companies comprising about one-fifth of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization had reported third-quarter results, with earnings beating by 4.7% and 77% of companies topping their bottom-line expectations, according to Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Golub.\n\nThat said, these results have topped expectations by a smaller degree compared to beats in the past. The historical average of beats over the past five years sits at 5.4%, according to Golub.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York December 22, 2014. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS) More\n\n\u201cQ3 earnings season so far is not as strong as the headlines indicate. Yes, more companies are beating but by [smaller] amounts than usual. The problem is margin pressure; revenue surprises are running ahead of historical averages,\u201d Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note Monday. \u201cAnalysts are still cutting Q3/Q4 numbers as a result.\u201d\n\nCompanies announcing results this week include consumer names like Procter & Gamble (PG) and McDonald\u2019s (MCD), tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) and industrial and aerospace companies United Technologies (UTX), Caterpillar (CAT) and Boeing (BA).\n\nThe packed slate of quarterly results comes as investors continue to eye ongoing geopolitical concerns, with headline risks posing a threat to equity indices\u2019 performance even as earnings roll in.\n\nOverseas, the British pound steadied at around 1.30 per dollar (GBPUSD=X) Monday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to have Parliament approve his Brexit deal on Saturday, forcing him to seek out another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d of the agreement or request an extension to the October 31 deadline. European stocks shook off the uncertainty, however, with the major FTSE 100, CAC 40, DAX and STOXX 600 indices all in the green.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S.-China trade deal updates have mostly underlined progress as of late. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Monday morning that President Donald Trump could remove a tranche of tariff increases set to take effect December 15 if further talks with China go well.\n\nRhetoric out of Beijing has been similarly upbeat. China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He said publicly Saturday that the sides had made \u201csubstantial progress in many fields\u201d and had laid the foundation for signing a multi-part agreement.\n\nU.S., UK and German government debt yields rose Monday morning across their respective curves. Federal Reserve officials remain in a blackout period this week and will not deliver public remarks ahead of their Oct. 29-30 rate-setting meeting. As of Monday morning, markets priced in a more than 90% probability of another quarter point cut to benchmark interest rates after the October meeting.\n\nSTOCKS: Wall Street gets bullish on Peloton, Halliburton earnings disappoint\n\nPeloton (PTON) shares rose more than 2% in early trading after around a dozen Wall Street firms initiated bullish calls on the stock.
