And if the A's make the move it would make it the second professional sports franchise from Oakland to flee to the desert of Nevada. The Oakland Raiders are leaving for Sin City for the 2020 season. The threat comes amid years of strife between the A's and the city as the ball club attempts to build a ballpark that can compete with other modern stadiums.\n\nBut David Samson, former president of the Miami Marlins, doesn\u2019t think that the Athletics will be on the move anytime soon. The dialogue from Manfred about relocation is \u201cpart of baseball\u2019s playbook\u201d to pressure a city on the stadium front or what Samson calls \u201cleverage-seeking,\u201d Samson told FoxBusiness.com.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the playbook that the Marlins used and I used with the Marlins, including I took trip to Vegas after we got approval to seek relocation alternatives so when all that doesn\u2019t work, that\u2019s when relocation becomes possible,\u201d Samson said. \u201cIn order to get a ballpark done these days, you have to get to the edge, like no net. Like \u2018Free Solo,\u2019 the Oscar-winning documentary. You have to be hanging on with chalk and fingers, waiting for a deal to get done. Oakland is not there yet but they are certainly putting chalk on their hands.\u201d\n\nDespite having made the playoffs last year, the A's only averaged 20,521 fans, which was one of the lower numbers in baseball. It does represent a 5.6% increase over last year\u2019s number at the turnstile, however. Regardless, the attendance number is still painfully low, and that is due, in part, on the team's inability to bring in high-end corporate money to a decrepit stadium, the A\u2019s had the lowest revenue in baseball last year. Moving the team sounds ideal to the baseball neutral, but isn\u2019t likely at this juncture.\n\nI think the commissioner would prefer, and I don\u2019t like speaking for him, but what I think he\u2019d prefer is that Oakland and Tampa would settle their issues to save every relocation market for expansion because the eventual goal of baseball is 32 [teams], so why waste an expansion city for relocation? - David Samson, former Miami Marlins owner\n\nRingCentral Coliseum, home of the A\u2019s, is outdated and not in the quaint way of Fenway Park or Wrigley Field. The multi-purpose stadium, which was also built for the Raiders, lacks the amenities of modern ballparks and the cash-cow sections such as luxury suites.\n\nEven downsized, the stadium is too large for most baseball crowds. The Coliseum was built in 1968 and can be used for football and baseball. There is no high-end dining, no plush luxury seats and the league\u2019s largest foul area means that fans in some of the most expensive seats are shockingly far away from the action. And the dugouts have been flooded with raw sewage on at least four occasions.\n\nAll this says nothing about dimensions, configurations and general upkeep that is among the poorest in all of professional sports in the country. The A\u2019s need a stadium for revenue purposes, especially as they\u2019ve consistently fielded successful teams in recent years.\n\nThe A\u2019s, despite having made the playoffs last year, only averaged 20,521 fans, one of the lower numbers in baseball. It does represent an improvement, a 5.6 percent increase over last year\u2019s number at the turnstile.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBut that A's don't own the Coliseum. The stadium is owned by Alameda County and Oakland. The city is attempting to prevent the county from selling its share of the Coliseum to the A's so that it can redevelop the 155-acre site to help finance a privately owned ballpark elsewhere in the city.\n\nSamson said that strong candidates for expansion include Mexico City, Nashville and Portland, OR. He doesn\u2019t think the buzz around Montreal \u201cis serious\u201d due to the lack of television money in the market and their own stadium issues.", "description": "There may be rumors of the Oakland Athletics moving to Las Vegas but former MLB executive David Samson said this is just part of the league's playbook to get a new stadium.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/rob-manfred-mlb-2017-owners-meeting-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
