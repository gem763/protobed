I was happy. I was proud,\u201d said Hall, who for the past two years has been going to graduate school at night while working full-time as an academic program coordinator at Washington University in St. Louis. \"I was proud of myself too because there were some nights where I was like I don't know how this is going to work.\"\n\nHall's best friend, and the children's godmother, orchestrated the surprise, keeping them at her house for a few hours one day so they could make the signs and learn the dance.\n\n\"We spent like a day drawing on the [signs] and we did the dance one more time after drawing them [to practice],\" said Edwyn, Hall's oldest child. \"I was proud of my mom for doing this.\"\n\nCourtesy Candace Hall\n\nHall, who will graduate in May, said she has made it through the past two years of being a student, mom and employee thanks to help from her husband and her mother-in-law, whom she calls her \"mother-in-love.\"\n\n\"None of this is possible without them supporting the family and supporting me in the way that they did,\" said Hall.\n\nShe also accomplished it by using her \"me time\" at night to study and including her kids in her educational journey.\n\nCourtesy Candace Hall\n\n\"She always does her homework at the dining room table, at the end [seat],\" Edwyn said of his mom. \"I sit next to her.\"\n\nHall said she heard people say many times that she was \"crazy\" for going back to school while working full-time and being a mom to three young kids.\n\nShe wants her kids to remember that she earned her doctorate anyway.\n\n\"I hope my kids take away that they can do anything that they set their minds to. I know people say that all the time to kids growing up, but I hope that I\u2019ve demonstrated that,\" she said. \"I hope they\u2019re not afraid to go to their dreams no matter what people say to them.\"", "description": "Candace Hall's three kids delivered a choreographed routine.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dissertation-1-ht-er-190924_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
