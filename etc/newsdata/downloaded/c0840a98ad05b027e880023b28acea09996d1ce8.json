It was a huge surprise for the Allies,\" Calendini said.\n\nBy September 12, the Dragoon forces had met up with the soldiers advancing from Normandy, allowing the Allies to consolidate their forces before the final offensive to wrest France from its German occupiers.\n\nOverlooked legacy\n\nAt the time, France's \"Army B\" consisted of nearly 600 000 men, two-thirds of them from African garrisons in countries still under French colonial rule.\n\nThe force included around 233 000 \"Muslims\", as they were referred to at the time - including Moroccan battalions and infantry sections from Algeria, as well as fighters from Senegal and other West African colonies.\n\nThere were also so-called Marsouins (\"porpoises\"), recruits from France's territories in the Pacific or the Caribbean.\n\n\"Without its empire, France would have been just a liberated country. Thanks to its empire, France is a victorious country,\" Gaston Monnerville, a deputy from the overseas territory of French Guiana, said shortly after the war ended.\n\nAfrican troops in particular paid a heavy price, with 55 000 killed over the course of World War II.\n\nYet for years their sacrifices were largely overlooked by most French, and in 1959 the government added injury to the insult by capping their military pensions as African nations gained their independence.\n\nFrance finally agreed in 2002 to increase the payouts to partially make up for the veterans' lost spending power over the subsequent decades - though they were still far below those of French ex-soldiers.\n\nPressure continued to mount until then president Nicolas Sarkozy announced in 2010 that pensions would be the same for all its veterans, regardless of nationality or place of residence.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
