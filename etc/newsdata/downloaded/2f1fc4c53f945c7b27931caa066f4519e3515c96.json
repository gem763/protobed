Any spiritual practice, prayer or meditation that takes us beneath the surface of our daily life, beneath the clutter of the mind and the demands of the outer world, can be a place of reconnection, a place where we can rest inwardly and be nourished by the deeper roots of our being. And if we need an added ingredient to help us in this work, silence is most valuable, especially in today\u2019s world where noise surrounds us more and more. To learn to be present in an inner and outer silence is a doorway to what is real within ourselves and in the world around us.\n\n\n\nReturning to our essential self we may find a balance resurfacing from deep within, a balance that reconnects and restores us, and also allows us to contribute in unseen ways.\n\n\n\nOne of Carl Jung\u2019s favourite stories was The Rainmaker, in which a world out of balance, in a time of drought and suffering, was healed not through activity, but through a rainmaker retiring to a hut in silence.\n\n\n\nThree days later, the rain came and the drought was over. When he was asked how he brought the rain, he replied, \u201cOh, I can explain that. I come from another country where things are in order. Here they are out of order, they are not as they should be by the ordinance of heaven. Therefore, the whole country is not in Tao, and I am also not in the natural order of things because I am in a disordered country. So I had to wait three days until I was back in Tao, and then naturally the rain came.\u201d\n\n\n\nIf we are to participate creatively in these toxic times, to bring rain to a land where the inner and outer wells have run dry, first we need to be present \u201cin another country where things are in order.\u201d And this \u2018other country\u2019 is not so far away, but can be found in the Earth beneath our feet, and in the space between the in-breath and the out-breath where the soul is present. But first, we need to reconnect, to return to this place of balance. And the simplest way is through stillness and silence. We can commune with the primal forces of nature, we can return to what is sacred and essential to our life and to the life of the Earth. Here in this \u2018other country\u2019 the air is not toxic, and the miasma of today\u2019s world in this post-truth era is not blurring our vision. The laughter of children rings true. Stillness is here, and the seasons are in balance. Every in-breath and out-breath is sacred. The breath, the soul, the Earth and its seasons, are linked together, nourished by each other.\n\n\n\nHow do you feel and live your connection to the Earth?\n\n\u25a0 In my daily life, there are two practices that help me to reconnect with the Earth and her sacred nature, walking and prayer. I have always loved to walk early in the morning, to sense the Earth at the beginning of a day, to feel her pulse, beauty and magic, before thoughts and demands clutter my day. Waking early, I have a hot cup of tea, meditate in silence, and then, as soon as the first light comes, I walk down the hill to the road beside the wetlands where I live. Sometimes, the frost is sparkling around me, sometimes the water is clouded with fog, an egret appearing white against the reeds. This is another time of silent meditation, walking, breathing, feeling the Earth. I try to be as empty as possible, just to be present in the half light, aware of what is around me. Prayer, meditation, presence, awareness \u2014 these are just words for a practice that immerses me in a mystery we call nature. Here the sacred speaks to me in its own language, and I try to listen.\n\n\n\nNow I live beside the wetlands, and the tidal water is part of this meeting, this communion. Other times, in other landscapes, it has been rivers and streams, the sounds of waterfowls\u2019 wings, the dawn rising across meadows. Or in forests, a different bird chorus, animals skittering across the path, a deer and her young. Always it is a listening awareness, a deep receptivity to what is around me, an honouring of a world other than people. It is a remembrance of what is essential, elemental, and its nourishment carries me through the day. It is a return to the sacred, sensed and felt, without words or thoughts \u2014 a primal consciousness as if of the first day.\n\n\n\nThe Earth gives us sustenance: the air we breathe, the food we eat. She is generous in so many ways, even as we forget her and abuse her. But there is also this deeper nourishment, this invisible, intangible giving. My early morning walk is a communion \u2014 if I am receptive, it is a wine drunk deeply. It comes through Her landscape, moss dripping from the trees, white and pink blossoms welcoming spring, the cry of a sea bird. Those first rays of sunrise are always a blessing. I do not understand this with my mind, but my soul feels it, needs it. Once again, we are back at the beginning, in that elemental world we never truly leave. Our present culture may have forgotten it, disowned it, covered it over, and may pretend we no longer need this communion, but my soul and my feet know otherwise. This is the landscape of the soul as much as it is the wetlands stretching towards the ocean. But it is also any landscape we walk. A walk on city streets is made of the same elements: feet touching the ground, the rhythm of walking, breathing, the same sky overhead, the wind touching the face.\n\n\n\nI would like to say it is easy, but so often I have to remember to reconnect, to empty the clutter of the coming day from my mind, my everyday thoughts.\n\n\n\nAnd there is another form of prayer that touches me deeply at this time of the Earth\u2019s distress. With our own heart we can pray for the Earth, just as we pray for another person, for a sick relative or friend. It helps first to acknowledge that she is not \u2018unfeeling matter\u2019 but a living being that has given us life, and to open our heart to her suffering: the physical suffering we see in the dying species and polluted waters, the deeper suffering of our collective disregard for her soul and sacred nature. And then from this depth of feeling, and a deep love for the Earth, I place the whole Earth in my heart and offer her to God, to the Creator, to my own Beloved. It is a simple and powerful way of remembering the Earth in my prayers, an offering of love. \u25a0\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/749302-1350-420-5/reconnect-with-earth.img", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
