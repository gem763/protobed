As Mearsheimer sees it, American foreign policy over much of the past three decades placed too much weight on the power of liberal ideals, while greatly underestimating the enduring influence of realism and nationalism.\n\nAlthough Mearsheimer is not without his critics, it is hard to disagree with his broader point: while many in the world may love liberal democracy, realism and nationalism are powerful and resilient forces. If anything, the rise of China is a testament to this point.\n\nWhile continuing to reject liberal democracy, the Chinese Communist Party masterfully harnessed both realism and nationalism in establishing its case for legitimacy. Strong economic growth for the vast majority of the country allowed for the party to make a very compelling case that they could serve the interests of the people, even if the people did not all hold their values. After all, their material lives were improving. The party coupled this realistic \u201cperformance legitimacy\u201d with a tightly controlled nationalist narrative, emphasising China\u2019s past greatness, hundred years of \u201chumiliation\u201d at the hands of foreign powers, and the CCP\u2019s indispensable role in returning the nation to greatness.\n\nYet as the Party now faces perhaps its most challenging period in decades, it appears as though Beijing is suffering from its own form of \u201cdelusion\u201d. If, as Mearsheimer would put it, the US has overestimated the power of liberalism and underestimated that of realism and nationalism, China\u2019s mistake has been to overestimate realism and their own narrative of nationalism while underestimating both liberalism and alternative forms of nationalism. This, somewhat ironically, is undermining their realistic interests as well.\n\nTo observe this dynamic at play, look no further than Beijing\u2019s failure to resolve the crisis in Hong Kong. All indications seem to show that in the CCP\u2019s eyes, the problems facing the people of Hong Kong are purely economic, and therefore the solutions must be as well. Protestors\u2019 demands for human rights and democracy, Chinese media would have you believe, are the influence purely of \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d and \u201cseparatists\u201d.\n\nAnd yet, while economic problems certainly play a role, it is abundantly clear that no sustainable solution can be found without addressing the conflict between the mainland\u2019s narrative of nationalism and Hongkongers\u2019 sense of identity, as well as the role that liberal democracy plays in that identity.\n\nMany of the protestors of this year became initiated into political activism through protesting a 2012 plan to implement mainland-style \u201cpatriotic education\u201d curricula into Hong Kong schools. The 2014 Umbrella Movement began as a response to a Beijing-led attempt to limit Hongkongers\u2019 rights to universal suffrage. The 2019 protest movement began with opposition to a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed mainland authorities to circumvent Hong Kong\u2019s judicial system and try Hong Kong criminal suspects in a system with a conviction rate over 99%.\n\nEconomic issues may provide dry tinder, but it is issues of rights, democracy, and national identity which consistently light the match.\n\nAnti-government protesters wearing masks and holding umbrellas take part in a march in Hong Kong, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019. A group of pro-democracy Hong Kong legislators filed a legal challenge against the government's use of a colonial-era emergency law to criminalize the wearing of masks at rallies to quell anti-government demonstrations, which diminished in intensity but didn't stop.

As one can imagine, this was not greeted with the warmest possible reception from the region\u2019s pro-democracy lawmakers.\n\nBeijing\u2019s stale playbook to respond with appeals to nationalism, along with economic carrots and sticks, has run into obstacles abroad as well. As the Trump administration began levying tariffs on Chinese goods in mid-2018, China responded by placing retaliatory tariffs on agricultural products from regions that had strongly supported the US president in his 2016 presidential campaign, hoping to undermine some of Trump\u2019s political base. Yet despite the economic harm, support for the president among the nation\u2019s farmers remained high.\n\nFor those familiar with the American electorate, this may not come as much of a surprise. Perhaps Beijing would have been well-served to read reporter Thomas Frank\u2019s 2004 book What\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?, in which he dissects a trend in his home state of Kansas that now seems to be even more pronounced: for many, the values of nationalism, anti-elitism, and conservative religion often have far greater political impact than simple economic interests.\n\nMore recently, similar such misreadings by Beijing have caused additional backlash. After finding that by threatening to cut off access to Chinese consumers the party could successfully pressure foreign businesses from Apple to Zara into adhering to the CCP\u2019s rhetorical standards, a recent failure to achieve the same outcome with the NBA may be demonstrating the limits of such an approach, when their attempt at economic coercion created a political and media firestorm in the US like only the hot-button topics of sports, nationalism, and free speech can.\n\nWhile the NBA\u2019s relationship with China may remain intact at least into the foreseeable future, increased profile of Beijing\u2019s \u201csharp power\u201d attempts will be at the front of any organisation\u2019s mind before attempting to partner with Chinese entities or pursue Chinese consumers. The irony in much of this is that as China\u2019s economy slows and foreign investment into the country tapers off, Beijing may find that its ability to project power through its economic heft weakens as well.\n\nChina owes much of its rise to its practical approach to problem-solving and clear-eyed analysis of others\u2019 interests as well as their own. In addition to economic interests, humans throughout the world also have values, many of which are incompatible with those of Beijing. Cynically ignoring that those values exist, or dismissing them as illegitimate, is a surefire recipe for disaster.\n\nThe CCP, when at its best, has been masterfully realistic. Yet at this moment, reality is staring them in the face, and they seem to be unable \u2013 or unwilling \u2013 to open their eyes.\n\nElliott Zaagman is a writer, speaker, and executive coach who focuses on how China and its organisations engage the world.
