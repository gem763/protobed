(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba.\n\nSince the end of the Obama administration, the number of Cubans deported from the U.S. has increased more than tenfold to more than 800 in the past year as the Trump administration enforces a new policy inked just days before it took over. It is also imposing its own sharp limits on who is eligible for asylum. That's an unwelcome development for growing numbers of asylum-seeking Cubans who had long benefited from a generous U.S. approach and their government's unwillingness to take its people back.\n\nFor decades, Cubans fleeing the communist-governed island had for the most part enjoyed unique privileges. Even after the cold war ended, they were given a certain path to legal residence once they touched U.S. soil through the policy known as \"wet foot, dry foot.\"\n\nBut an agreement reached during the final days of the Obama administration ended that and required Cuba to take back citizens who receive deportation orders going forward and consider on a case-by-case basis the return of the thousands of other Cubans who had received such orders over the decades but remained in the U.S. because their country wouldn't take them back.\n\nSince Trump took office, more Cubans arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border have encountered new limits, including a policy introduced last month that denies protection to asylum seekers who have passed through another country before reaching Mexico and have not sought asylum there.\n\nDespite the new agreement, Cuba remains reluctant to take its people back, and is one of 10 countries that the U.S. government labels \"recalcitrant.\" That makes it difficult for the administration to enforce its aggressive measures against asylum \u2014 and leaves many Cubans in limbo.\n\nMany, like Sanchez, are baffled by their predicament.\n\nSanchez is married to Barbara Rodriguez, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Miami, but was unable to apply for a visa in Cuba to join his wife in the U.S. because the Trump administration pulled most of its embassy staff out, outsourcing family-related visa petitions to consular services in Colombia or Guyana. Rodriguez claims Sanchez was facing increasing political persecution after having brushes with local authorities over such episodes as damaging a referendum ballot as a sign of protest.\n\nThe couple agreed he had to get out of Cuba, saying they had learned he was being investigated and could face jail time. Feeling they had no time to waste \u2014 and with no visa services available in Cuba \u2014 Sanchez traveled to Nicaragua and through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S., at a port of entry where authorities detained him and later sent him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for long-term custody.\n\n\"This is plain cruel, despite arriving in this country and demonstrating that you are persecuted and that you have credible fear. After all, this gets thrown away,\" said his wife, Rodriguez, who talks to Sanchez on the phone daily. \"The worse thing is that now I feel all that is left for him is deportation.\"\n\nIt is unclear how the Cuban government treats people who are deported from the U.S., but rights advocates and lawyers say they could face retaliation for claiming asylum, especially those who claimed they were being persecuted. By contrast, deportees to Mexico and Central American countries typically get a warm welcome home.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla told The Associated Press the increase in deportations stems from the country \"diligently fulfilling its commitments\" outlined in the accord with the Obama administration, but at the same time he blasted the U.S. for cutting consular services in Havana.\n\n\"It is a shame to politicize the human bond between people and between nations,\" he said.\n\nA chartered U.S. government flight landed in Havana on Sept. 27 with 96 Cubans aboard, and another with 120 arrived Aug. 30. U.S. officials say Cuba's acceptance of this limited number of deportees is a small step, but they believe the nation is still largely unwilling to work with the U.S. on repatriations. They note 39,243 Cubans living in the U.S. with deportation orders.", "description": "After seeking asylum in the United States at the Mexican border, Pablo Sanchez was placed in a detention center and is now facing what has become an increasingly common scenario under President Donald Trump: deportation to Cuba.
