But the one going public to flirt with coup-mongering \u2026 was one of the sons of the president of the republic,\u201d the broadsheet complained in an editorial.\n\nWriting in Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper, commentator Bernardo Mello Franco called the comment a deliberate attempt to fire up Bolsonaro\u2019s base and disguise his shortcomings as president amid a slump in support.\n\n\u201cCarlos Bolsonaro said what his dad thinks,\u201d Mello Franco warned, pointing to the \u201cauthoritarianism in the [family\u2019s] blood\u201d.\n\nAnother political observer, Bruno Boghossian, compared Carlos Bolsonaro\u2019s words to those of the Peru\u2019s former dictator Alberto Fujimori.\n\nEven Bolsonaro\u2019s vice-president, Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, was forced to weigh in on Brazil\u2019s latest filial crisis, declaring democracy \u201cessential\u201d to western civilization.\n\nDuring an interview in Brazil\u2019s capital, Bras\u00edlia, the opposition senator Randolfe Rodrigues said Carlos Bolsonaro\u2019s pronouncement underlined how taking a stand against Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right administration had become \u201ca civilizational, democratic and humanitarian task\u201d.\n\n\u201cEach day Brazilian democracy is being subjected to a litmus test \u2013 by the president\u2019s declarations, by the declarations of his sons, and by the acts they commit,\u201d Rodrigues said.\n\n\u201cHowever long his government lasts, I\u2019m convinced these will be among the saddest pages in Brazilian history,\u201d Rodrigues added, pointing to the multi-pronged threat he said Bolsonaro represented to Brazil\u2019s environment, international reputation and young democracy.\n\n\u201cIt will take us many years to recover from the number of civilizational setbacks Bolsonaro is ushering in.\u201d\n\nCarlos Bolsonaro responded to the criticism in waspish fashion, blaming the outcry on journalists he branded \u201cscoundrels\u201d, \u201cscum\u201d, \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201ctrash\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m a dictator? Fucking hell!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAddressing lawmakers in Bras\u00edlia, his brother, Eduardo Bolsonaro, downplayed the remark as \u201cno big deal\u201d.\n\nHe claimed it was \u201cvultures\u201d on Brazil\u2019s left \u2013 which has largely declined to condemn Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s authoritarian regime in Venezuela \u2013 who were enamoured of autocrats, not his family.\n\n\u201cThey are dictatorship lovers,\u201d Bolsonaro shouted.", "description": "Carlos Bolsonaro, whose father is an admirer of Brazil\u2019s former military dictatorship, accused of \u2018flirting with coup-mongering\u2019", "authors": ["Tom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882911320d9c94b0f7d2177b8139d8a031c68951/0_17_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1e32ac74c54838569f6e9f4ad085744", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
