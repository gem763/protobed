A collective, universal and ambitious signal,\u201d she added.\n\nThe UN\u2019s World Health Organization says 770,000 people died of HIV-related causes last year. Tuberculosis, a high risk for HIV-positive people, claimed some 1.7 million lives in 2017, and malaria more than 430,000.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Anything more a success\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe meeting is the sixth to replenish the fund since it was set up in 2002, with prominent supporters including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and U2 lead singer Bono in attendance.\n\nBut officials said ahead of the meeting that collecting such a large sum could prove challenging, especially as global attention moves from AIDS towards fighting climate change.\n\nAnything more than the $13 billion pledged at the fund\u2019s last meeting three years ago in Montreal \u201cwill be considered a success\u201d, said an official in the French presidency.\n\nMacron, however, made it clear at the UN General Assembly in September that he expected no less than $14 billion, saying \u201cno-one any longer can understand\u201d that people are unable to access medicines for the deadly disease trio.\n\nNGOs insist even more is needed \u2014 as much as $18 billion.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Less not acceptable\u2019 \u2013\n\nSome countries have announced their contribution. The US is the number one donor with a $4.68 billion contribution voted by Congress.\n\nBritain is set to pledge $1.7 billion and Germany $1.1 billion. It remains to be seen what France will contribute, although Macron has vowed it will be worthy of the country\u2019s historical status as the Fund\u2019s number two donor.\n\nFrance also wants the private sector to play a bigger role, and the fund is seeking $1 billion of the total from the business world.\n\n\u201cNo amount less than $14 billion will be acceptable,\u201d the AIDES and Coalition PLUS NGOs said in a statement, urging France to ramp up its contribution by 25 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are here to remember that behind this financial bargaining there are human lives,\u201d said AIDES president Aurelien Beaucamp.\n\nAIDES said that as things stand now, the meeting risks falling $200-$500 million short of its target.\n\nMacron will meet leaders including Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou and Cameroon President Paul Biya, while Rwandan President Paul Kagame is also set to be in attendance.\n\nThe Global Fund groups states, NGOs and private firms to support public health programmes around the world, investing about $4 billion every year.\n\nIt says it has helped save 32 million lives and provided prevention, treatment and care services to hundreds of millions of people, while the number of deaths caused by AIDS, TB and malaria each year has been reduced by 40 percent since 2002 in countries where the Fund invests.", "description": "Lyon (AFP) \u2013 The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria on Wednesday opened a drive to raise $14 billion to fight the global epidemics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/630a8c_global-fund-executive-peter-sands-addresses-opening-day-conference-as-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
