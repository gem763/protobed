What\u2019s one more ago around? Frankly, it\u2019s surprising Robert Zemeckis wasn\u2019t the first director signed on to helm Disney\u2019s upcoming live-action remake of Pinocchio. Sam Mendes was rumored for the gig when it was announced two years ago, and Paddington director Paul King was attached earlier this year, but according to Variety, Robert Zemeckis is now currently in talks to direct the film, presumably after he\u2019s finished with The Witches reboot starring Anne Hathaway, which he also wrote. And in case you\u2019re concerned a live-action film starring a CGI or motion-capture wooden puppet boy might end up within the city limits of Uncanny Valley, don\u2019t worry. Pinocchio will look perfect normal next to that talking cricket, fairy godmother, cigar-smoking human-donkey hybrids and prison that is the belly of a whale.", "description": "Robert Zemeckis is reportedly in talks to direct Disney\u2019s upcoming live-action version of Pinocchio.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/18-Robert-Zemeckis.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
