Neumann of trying to 'weaponise' his remarks\n\nMr Neumann then told the Cabinet minister that he had 'summarised' what had been said\n\nMr Gove said during his remarks that there were 'always challenges that pull us apart'.\n\n'There are temptations for people to pull apart rather than come together,' he said.\n\n'Well, the example of modern Germany reminds us how important it is to come together.\n\n'And as the Ambassador also reminded us, it also shows that we can come together quickly when we recognise how important it is to set aside divisions.\n\n'Britain made its democratic decision three years ago to leave the European Union \u2013 and I know there will be many people in this room who will deeply regret that decision.'\n\nHe then went onto say that 'Britain and Germany have so much in common' which reportedly prompted one heckler to shout 'nonsense'.\n\nBut Mr Gove continued: 'I think Britain and Germany do have much in common - but my view is that both of us are robust and successful democracies, both of us are examples of how you can combine commitment to a free enterprise economy with a commitment to social justice.'\n\nHis decision to talk about Brexit during an address on German Unity Day prompted Peter R. Neumann, a professor at King's College London, to tweet along with a photo of the event: 'So here's Michael Gove standing next to Luftwaffe band on Day of German Unity, telling German audience that decision to leave EU on par with fall of Berlin Wall and East Germans' quest for freedom.\n\n'Shouts from audience: \"Nonsense\".'\n\nMr Gove hit back on Twitter and said: 'Dear Peter - I realise there were lots of people in the room so you may have misheard me - but in a speech which celebrated the example of modern Germany can you provide the precise quotes in context which justify this claim - or if not then perhaps clarify?'\n\nMr Neumann replied: 'Please, by all means, correct me if I misheard or misunderstood.'\n\nMr Gove then responded: 'You did! Please reflect the whole speech in context - I\u2019d be in your debt to see an academic reflect the truth of an event rather than weaponise it for their own agenda.'\n\nMr Neumann then appeared to make reference to Mr Gove's famous remark from the 2016 EU referendum campaign that people had 'had enough of experts'.\n\nMr Gove, pictured in Downing Street on October 2, has been put in charge of the government's No Deal Brexit contingency planning\n\nLabour MP Ben Bradshaw said Mr Gove's address was 'shameless and totally ill-judged' before Mr Gove then claimed it has been Mr Bradshaw who had heckled him\n\nHe said: 'I summarised. My sincere apologies for any misunderstandings. I'm only an \"expert\", after all.'\n\nMeanwhile, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw labelled Mr Gove's remarks 'shameless' and 'totally ill-judged'.\n\nMr Gove then claimed that it was actually Mr Bradshaw who had heckled him at the event.\n\nHe tweeted: 'Dear Ben - I appreciate you enjoyed heckling but what part of my praise for modern Germany did you disagree with?'", "description": "Michael Gove is locked in a furious row with his Brexit critics after he was accused of comparing the UK's departure from the European Union to German reunification and the fall of the Berlin Wall.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/09/19287872-0-image-a-2_1570176368705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
