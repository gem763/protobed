You can buy Primark clothes on Amazon\n\nUnfortunately, you can't buy items on the Primark website .\n\nBut you can buy them on Amazon .\n\nIf you really want to avoid shopping in-store log in to Amazon and search for Primark clothes to buy online.\n\n2. Avoid weekends at all costs\n\nIf you do prefer to shop in-store, avoid shopping at the weekend.\n\nPlan your shopping trip on a week day before or after work when stores are quieter.\n\nStores are open a lot later than you might think during week days.\n\n3. Opening and closing times differ depending on the branch\n\nThere are five Primark stores in Greater Manchester they give you a good idea of how branches have different opening and closing times across the country.\n\nWant to shop on the High Street? The Primark on Market Street opens the earliest - from Monday to Saturday - at 8am.\n\nBut if you're a late shopper, head to the shopping centres like the Trafford Centre after work where Primark is open until 10pm.\n\nHere are the opening and closing times of the five Primark stores in Greater Manchester:\n\nPrimark Manchester - Market Street\n\nMonday to Friday 8am to 9pm, Saturday 8am to 8pm, Sunday 10.30am to 5pm\n\nPrimark Trafford - Selfridges & Co, Trafford Centre\n\nMonday to Friday 10am to 10pm, Saturday 10am to 9pm, Sunday noon to 6pm\n\nPrimark Stockport - Chestergate\n\nMonday to Friday 8.30am to 6pm, Saturday 8.30pm to 6pm, Sunday 11am to 5pm\n\nPrimark Oldham - Market Place\n\nMonday to Friday 8.30am to 7pm, Saturday 8.30am to 6pm, Sunday 10.30am to 5pm\n\nPrimark Bury - The Rock Shopping Centre\n\nMonday to Saturday 9am to 8pm, Sunday 11am to 5pm\n\n4.

Count how many staff members are on each till at the checkout\n\nStores usually have a couple of check out stations on each floor.\n\nBefore you join one, have a quick scan and count how many staff members are on the tills at each station.\n\nThe more staff members on the checkout, the quicker the queues will go down.\n\n8. Choose the checkout on menswear\n\nAnd don't just opt for the check out on the floor you're currently shopping on.\n\nThe menswear department in Primark Manchester is usually a lot quieter so you should find shorter queues.\n\n9. Don't be afraid to ask for a discount\n\nIt's common to find make-up fingerprints and other small marks on Primark items.\n\nIf your product is slightly marked or damaged but you still want it - ask for a discount when you get to the checkout.\n\nYou could knock 10 per cent off the original price.\n\n10. You need a receipt to return an item\n\nSome high street shops allow you to return some items without a receipt - Primark is not one of them.\n\nThe website states: \"To obtain a refund or exchange a till receipt is needed, the item must be in a saleable condition with all tags attached and it must be within 28 days of purchase.\n\nYou will find the latest date that you can return an item on your till receipt.\"\n\n11. Shop with your gym bag\n\nWe live in the rainy capital of the North.\n\nSometimes Primark's brown paper bags just aren't going to make it home in one piece.\n\nSay no to a paper bag and bring your own gym bag or ruck sack from home.", "description": "From learning size translations to the best times to visit Primark, here's all you need to know", "authors": ["Alice Irving"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20568726.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_121019Slug_10800JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
