The decision comes quickly after a July launch at Dunkin\u2019 Manhattan restaurants. Dunkin\u2019 Brands says the sandwich quickly became one its top-selling sandwiches.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud of our partnership with Beyond Meat (BYND) and thrilled to be the first U.S. quick service restaurant to offer Beyond Breakfast Sausage nationwide. Dunkin\u2019 (DNKN) is the brand that democratizes trends for America, and this latest addition to our menu gives consumers more choice to meet their evolving needs. The introduction of a plant-based option at our shops in Manhattan exceeded our expectations, exciting loyal fans and new customers alike. As we continue to transform our brand, we\u2019re proud to use our platform to give everyone the opportunity to enjoy the great taste and benefits of plant-based protein,\u201d Dunkin\u2019 Brands CEO David Hoffmann said in a statement.\n\nA Beyond Meat spokesperson didn\u2019t return a request for comment on the news. It\u2019s Beyond Meat\u2019s first nationwide fast-food rollout.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 24: Influencer Michael Tommasiello attends Dunkin' and Beyond Meat unveil Beyond Sausage Breakfast Sandwich at an event hosted by DeAndre Jordan of The Brooklyn Nets at Dunkin' Donuts on July 24, 2019 in New York City.

For Dunkin\u2019, it has provided the increasingly coffee focused chain with a good bit of buzz among consumers. Buzz is crucial in the crazy competitive fast food space. In addition, the sandwich was specially designed for Dunkin\u2019 and is unavailable at rival chains. Going forward, the nationwide rollout should only enhance that competitive position for Dunkin\u2019 (at least in the near-term) during the all-important breakfast hours.\n\nAs for Beyond Meat, the news continues to show an often skeptical Wall Street that the brand is in fact here to stay. The company has wracked several big partnerships this year in the fast food space, from its Beyond Chicken at Yum! Brands-owned KFC to a burger at Canadian McDonald\u2019s restaurants. Further, the nationwide rollout at Dunkin\u2019 signals Beyond Meat is getting its infrastructure to a place where it could support more fast-food deals, global expansion and greater distribution at retailers such as Target.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
