REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media urged investors to remain rational and not take Beijing\u2019s support for blockchain as a boost for virtual currencies, after comments by Chinese President Xi Jinping drove up shares in blockchain-related firms and the price of bitcoin.\n\nXi said last week that China should accelerate the development of blockchain technology, a digital ledger that forms the backbone of many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. His remarks sparked a rush into the shares of firms engaged in, or believed to be engaged in blockchain or digital currency-related businesses.\n\n\u201cBlockchain\u2019s future is here but we must remain rational,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily newspaper, which is published by China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary late on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe rise of blockchain technology was accompanied by that of cryptocurrencies, but innovation in blockchain technology does not mean we should speculate in virtual currencies,\u201d it said.\n\nTraders from three Chinese brokerages also told Reuters that they received a notice from the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Monday which said, \u201cfor any blockchain-related (topics), we ask listed companies to make statements based on facts and not make any exaggerated claims or create vicious hype\u201d.\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe government cracked down on the country\u2019s cryptocurrency industry in 2017 with regulators banning the practice of creating and selling virtual currencies or tokens and shutting local cryptocurrency trading exchanges, saying they were facilitating illegal fundraising and pyramid schemes.\n\nChinese officials, however, said at the time that research into blockchain technology was still encouraged although Xi\u2019s comments were the first time Beijing had publicly thrown such support behind the sector.\n\nBeijing is also creating its own central bank-issued digital currency to cut the costs of circulating paper money and boost policymakers\u2019 control of money supply.", "description": "Chinese state media urged investors to remain rational and not take Beijing's support for blockchain as a boost for virtual currencies, after comments by Chinese President Xi Jinping drove up shares in blockchain-related firms and the price of bitcoin.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446097427&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0E2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
