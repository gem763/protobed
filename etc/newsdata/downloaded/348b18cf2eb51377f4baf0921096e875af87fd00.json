Both were released on bail.\n\nOutside the court, demonstrators queued to get in, some chanting slogans like \"Wearing a face mask isn't a crime\" and \"The law is unjust\".\n\nMany said they feared the mask ban was just the first of more emergency orders to come.\n\n\"It's an excuse to just introduce other totalitarian laws, next is martial law,\" one protester outside the court, who gave his surname Lo, told AFP.\n\n- Few concessions -\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to the mainland.\n\nThis fuelled fears of an erosion of liberties promised under the 50-year \"one country, two systems\" model China agreed to ahead of the 1997 handover by Britain.\n\nAfter Beijing and local leaders took a hard stance to the initial protests, the demonstrations snowballed into a wider movement calling for more democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\nLam has refused major concessions, but struggled to come up with any political solution.\n\nThe past week has seen a particularly intense stretch of protests.\n\nThe worst clashes to date erupted on Tuesday as China celebrated 70 years of Communist Party rule, with a teenager shot and wounded by police as he attacked an officer.\n\nOver the weekend largely peaceful flash mob rallies and marches featured people wearing masks.\n\nBut more hardcore protesters also went on the rampage, trashing subway stations, ransacking government offices and vandalising businesses with mainland ties.\n\nLarge parts of the railway network closed over the weekend because of the vandalism, while many shops and malls closed. Some subways stations and shops remained closed on Monday, a public holiday in Hong Kong.\n\n- PLA warning -\n\nSunday witnessed the largest protests, with police firing tear gas to disperse tens of thousands of people marching on the main island. Clashes broke out at multiple other locations throughout the day, with dozens injured.\n\nA warning flag was even raised on the roof of a People's Liberation Army barracks after protesters shone laser pens at the building, the first time Chinese troops in the city have made such a move.\n\nOn the mainland, Beijing flexed its muscles by pulling a top US basketball team's games from state broadcaster CCTV after its manager posted a tweet featuring the message \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong\".\n\nThe Houston Rockets tried to calm waters, issuing apologies from players and the manager.", "description": "Hong Kong democracy protesters arrested for defying a new face mask ban appeared in court on Monday following a violent weekend of unrest which saw bloody clashes with police and widespread vandalism that crippled the city's train network.
