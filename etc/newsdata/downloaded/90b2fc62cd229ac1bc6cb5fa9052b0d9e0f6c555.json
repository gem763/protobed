(Jim Bourg / Reuters)\n\nI have an Impromptus column today, with the usual m\u00e9lange. The column begins with \u201cGet over it.\u201d This is what Marion Barry said when, after a prison term, he had another term \u2014 a fourth term as mayor of Washington, D.C. Some Washingtonians grumbled about this. And Barry said, \u201cGet over it.\u201d The phrase has returned to our political life, courtesy of Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s chief of staff, or acting chief of staff. \u201cI have news for everybody,\u201d he said: \u201cGet over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d The Trump-Pence campaign has put Get Over It on a T-shirt ($30), placing the president\u2019s distinctive hair over the \u201co\u201d in \u201cover.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere on the Corner, I wanted to add something to this \u2014 something related to \u201cGet over it.\u201d Barry uttered that phrase in 1994. (It is one of his two immortal phrases. The other is, \u201cThe young lady set me up.\u201d He did not say \u201cthe young lady,\u201d but you can look up the original.) Something else happened in 1994: For the first time in eons \u2014 40 years \u2014 voters nationwide elected the Republican party to a majority in the House of Representatives. That meant that a certain Georgia Republican would be speaker.\n\nIt is hard to imagine, at this remove, how far-fetched that seemed. It was once far-fetched that Nancy Pelosi could be speaker, too. In fact, Republicans tried to scare people in 2006 by asking, \u201cSpeaker Pelosi?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late 1994 \u2014 between Election Day and Christmas \u2014 a bumper sticker appeared on Capitol Hill: Speaker Newt: Deal with it.\n\nAlso in Impromptus today, I have a note on nationalism. It was occasioned by an e-mail from a reader, who said, \u201cAmerican nationalists seem to have more affinity for nationalists in other countries than they do for their fellow Americans who aren\u2019t nationalists.\u201d Yes, there is an international movement of nationalists, as Nigel Farage and others have said. (Steve Bannon\u2019s organization, based in Brussels, is called \u201cThe Movement.\u201d) Something similar is true of advocates of liberal democracy: They are allied, wherever they live. Ideas form bonds between people \u2014 think of religion \u2014 in addition to food, soil, folk music, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhom do I have more in common with? A democracy protester on the streets of Hong Kong or Michael Moore, who grew up an hour away from me and rooted for the same baseball team (the Detroit Tigers)? We could explore that question at length.\n\nIn Impromptus, I quote Abraham Lincoln, in his eulogy for Henry Clay: \u201cMr. Clay\u2019s predominant sentiment, from first to last, was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty \u2014 a strong sympathy with the oppressed everywhere, and an ardent wish for their elevation. . . . He loved his country partly because it was his own country, but mostly because it was a free country.\u201d\n\nI would like to add something from Edmund Burke, the patron saint of conservatives. (In the late 1980s, John Judis wrote a biography of WFB whose subtitle was \u201cPatron Saint of Conservatives,\u201d but I think Burke beat Bill to it.) WFB liked to quote Burke to the effect that \u201ca country, to be loved, ought to be lovely.\u201d (In the 18th century, \u201clovely\u201d meant \u201clovable.\u201d) I have looked up the precise passage, which goes like this:\n\nThere ought to be a system of manners in every nation, which a well-formed mind would be disposed to relish. To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely. But power, of some kind or other, will survive the shock in which manners and opinions perish; and it will find other and worse means for its support.\n\nImpromptus has a slew of other items today, touching on China, \u201chuman scum\u201d (the president\u2019s designation of Republicans who oppose or criticize him), Elizabeth Warren, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Harold Bloom, and more. I end with a brief appreciation of my colleague David French, late of NR.
