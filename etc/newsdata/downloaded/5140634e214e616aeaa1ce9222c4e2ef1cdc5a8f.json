The \u2018send her back\u2019 chanting at that rally in North Carolina, chilling to my bone.\u201d\n\nRobert Costa asked, \u201cSo we had a 1930s moment?\u2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke said, \u201cIn Florida, in May of this year \u2014 you know the president has warned about the infestation, the invasion, the predators, the animals, dehumanizing language to talk about humans who he has placed in cages. We have lost the lives of seven children in our custody and care. He\u2019s telling that rally in Florida \u2018what are we going to do about these people who are coming here?\u2019 And someone yells out \u2018shoot them.\u2019 And that crowd roars in laughter and applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the president, with that shit-eating smirk on his face, smiles and laughs in consent, giving the green light to that killer in Allen, TX, who drove 600 miles to El Paso with a AK-47, who said he was going to stop the invasion that he had been warned about by the president of the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cThat he didn\u2019t want to replaced as a white man in the United States of America. And when people in Charlottesville, VA, were talking about Jews, you will not replace us. President Trump said there are very fine people. If we fail to connect the dots and draw the conclusion, then we are going to die in our sleep as a country. We will lose this democracy.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday during an interview with The Washington Post, 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful former Rep.
