Hey @EASPORTSFIFA ...Who is this guy?'\n\nFranck Ribery has hit out at FIFA 20 for the unlikely look of his character in the video game\n\nAlthough Ribery appears to have gone under the radar at EA Sports, he is doing anything but in Serie A after moving to Florence from Bayern Munich on a free transfer in the summer.\n\nRibery quit the Allianz Stadium following 12 years in Munich, but the 36-year-old midfielder has already scored twice in six matches in Italy's top flight.\n\nAlready he seems to have formed a decent attacking partnership with Federico Chiesa and his September form was rewarded recently when he won the league's player of the month.\n\nRibery moved to Fiorentina in the summer following a free transfer from Bayern Munich\n\nIt is not certain if FIFA 20 publishers EA Sports will release a graphical update to improve the likeness of Ribery's character.\n\nFailing that then Ribery could make a second big switch of the year by turning his console gaming attentions to Konami's PES 2020, who appear to have a better likeness of the midfielder.\n\nBut for now he is unlikely to cause too much of a fuss, and will be more focused on a return to domestic action this weekend following the international break when his side take on Brescia on Monday night.\n\nHis form in Italy earned him the player of the month award for Serie A in September\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Fiorentina midfielder took to Twitter to post the image of his character in the video game which appears to carry little similarity with his real life persona.", "authors": ["Dan Ripley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/16/19844412-0-image-a-45_1571325489747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
