That\u2019s become the case with Martin Scorsese\u2018s new film The Irishman following its premiere at New York Film Festival last week. While lots of film critics have been publishing glowing reviews of the movie (you can read EW\u2019s own B+ review, courtesy of Leah Greenblatt, here), one of Scorsese\u2019s fellow Oscar-winning directors is also celebrating the Netflix release.\n\nGuillermo del Toro, who won multiple Oscars in 2017 (including Best Director) for his star-crossed fantasy romance The Shape of Water, saw The Irishman last week. Despite not being a film critic himself, del Toro often posts thoughts about movies he\u2019s seen and why people should check them out. He surpassed himself on Monday with a 13-tweet thread praising Scorsese\u2019s movie, analyzing its thematic elements, beginning with a comparison to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film Barry Lyndon.\n\nView photos\n\n\u201cIt is about lives that came and went, with all their turmoil, all their drama and violence and noise and loss\u2026 and how they invariably fade, like we all do,\u201d del Toro wrote in his first tweet.\n\nBased on the book I Heard You Paint Houses, The Irishman focuses on Frank Sheehan (Robert De Niro), a mob hitman who may have been behind the 1975 disappearance of legendary Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). By the end of the nearly three-and-a-half-hour runtime, Sheehan has aged into an old man with a high body count and more than a few regrets. A sharp awareness of mortality runs through the whole film, from the de-aging technology used on De Niro, Pacino, and Joe Pesci (who plays Philadelphia mob boss Russell Bufalino) to the fact that every minor mob character appears with a caption saying how they eventually died (usually in brutal circumstances).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the anti-\u2018My Way\u2019 (played in every gangster wedding in the world),\u201d del Toro wrote in a later tweet, invoking the classic Frank Sinatra song. \u201cRegrets they had more than few. The road cannot be undone and we all face the balance at the end. Even the voiceover recourse has De Niro trailing off into mumbled nonsense.\u201d\n\n2/13 \u201cIt was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now.\" We will all be betrayed and revealed by time, humbled by our bodies, stripped off our pride. \u2014 Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) September 30, 2019\n\n4/13 It\u2019s the anti\u201dMy Way\u201d (played in every gangster wedding in the world). Regrets they had more than few. The road cannot be undone and we all face the balance at the end. Even the voice over recourse has DeNiro trailing off into mumbled nonsense- \u2014 Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) September 30, 2019\n\n6/13 Scorsese started hand-in-hand with Schrader, as young men, looking for Bresson. This movie transmogrified all the gangster myths into regret. You live this movie. It never goes for the sexy of violence. Never for the spectacle. And yet it is spectacularly cinematic. \u2014 Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) September 30, 2019", "description": "Read Guillermo del Toro's Twitter thread review about The Irishman", "authors": ["Christian Holub"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HFM9goa1KZ.IRR4kP1FrGw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/421c3b2358a024d95cf9e87901c5b425", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
