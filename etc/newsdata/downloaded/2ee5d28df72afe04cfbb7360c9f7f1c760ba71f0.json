The acupuncturist stuck two pins in the unnamed woman\u2019s \u201cJian Jing\u201d pressure points at the top of both her shoulders.\n\nThe client told HDC the needles felt \u201cextremely deep.\u201d A half-hour later, the practitioner removed the needles and the client \u201cexperienced a sudden onset of right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath,\u201d according to the HDC report. In a horrifying phrase that I\u2019ve never heard before, the report says that the client (victim?) began to experience \u201c\u2018air\u2019 sensation around both lungs\u201d \u2014 a sensation that you should definitely never feel around your lungs.\n\nThe acupuncturist reportedly told the patient to rest-off the pain. When the woman laid down at home she noticed her right chest felt numb and her left chest hurt, so her husband took her to a medical clinic, which referred her to an emergency room where she was diagnosed with collapsed lungs.\n\nThe acupuncturist told HDC that she told the client that collapsed lung was a slight risk of this needle placement. However, the client told HDC that the practitioner did not tell her that the needles would be close to her lungs or that the placement could cause an injury.\n\nCommissioner Hill sided with the patient and decided that the acupuncturist breached the health code by not properly informing her client of the risks and not obtaining written consent prior to sticking needles into her body.\n\nHill recommended the acupuncturist undergo more acupuncture training and have the auditor determine if she is giving clients proper information and obtaining consent, and should then show HDC the results of the audit and proof of the continuing education.\n\nIf you ever decide to get needles stuck in you after hearing about this horror show, at least ask what the potential injuries could be.", "description": "The New Zealand Health and Disability Commissioner (HDC) has admonished an acupuncturist for going too deep, way too deep.", "authors": ["Mack Hogan", "Adam Clark Estes"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/tn8xudrzs5hkihec30b1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
