He trailed the president by 2 points, 45 percent to 43 percent, with a higher number of undecideds (7 percent) than any of the other potential matchups.\n\nBiden\u2019s strength in states like Wisconsin is central to his campaign, which argues that he\u2019s the strongest Democrat to take on Trump in 2020 and could win back disillusioned Midwestern voters who flipped key states to Trump in 2016. Trump claimed Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes, and it\u2019s become a top target of Democratic leaders, who are holding their national convention in Milwaukee next summer.\n\nThe survey also found Biden with an early lead in Wisconsin\u2019s April 2020 Democratic primary, at 31 percent followed by Warren at 24 percent. Sanders got 17 percent support in the primary test, while Buttigieg came in at 7 percent, Kamala Harris got 5 percent and every other candidate got 3 percent or less.\n\nWarren was the second choice of 27 percent of respondents, followed by Biden (19 percent), Sanders (13 percent), Buttigieg (10 percent) and Harris (9 percent).\n\nMarquette also looked at impeachment, finding that support in Wisconsin for impeachment has grown since April, to 46 percent \u2014 but that 49 percent of respondents believe there is not enough evidence to launch congressional impeachment hearings.\n\nAmong those who said they have read the rough transcript of a conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president, which has become a key piece of evidence in the investigation, 51 percent said they think there\u2019s enough reason to hold impeachment hearings, compared with 42 percent among those who have not read the summary of the phone call.\n\nThe survey of Wisconsin registered voters was conducted Oct. 13-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/42/c0/80168d72409491ff697571d74c45/20191023-joe-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
