It said that while sales in September were adversely affected by the warm weather, it saw a significant improvement in October, with sales up 5% year-on-year when temperatures fell.\n\n\"We believe the improved sales growth in October recouped some of the lost sales in September and we do not expect sales growth for the rest of the year to be as strong as October,\" it added.\n\nFor 2019-20 Next foresees full-price sales up 3.6% and pretax profit of 725 million pounds ($934 million), a 0.3% rise on the 2018-19 outcome, with earnings per share growth of 5.2%, reflecting share buybacks.\n\nShares in Next, up 72% so far this year, closed Tuesday at 6,850 pence, valuing the business at 9.12 billion pounds.\n\n($1 = 0.7763 pounds) (Reporting by James Davey; editing by Sarah Young)", "description": "LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - British clothing retailer Next  said on Wednesday sales picked up in October after a  poor start to autumn trading and the group...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
