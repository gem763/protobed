After several days of negotiations in Brussels that continued into the wee hours of Thursday morning, British and European officials reached an agreement the E.U. member states could live with that addresses some of the U.K.\u2019s concerns about sovereignty and independence in areas of trade and regulation.\n\nNow comes the hard part. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has pledged not to seek another extension of the October 31 Brexit deadline, must find a majority for this agreement in a hostile Parliament where he has alienated segments of his own party, where the opposition is champing at the bit for a chance to take him down in a new election, and which passed a law last month that would force him to request the extension he is committed to avoiding unless they approve a deal by Saturday. Johnson tried to get E.U. leaders to rule out another extension, which would put more pressure on Parliament to pass his deal, but they were not crazy enough to do so.\n\nAnnouncing the deal in Brussels on Thursday, Johnson expressed confidence that the House of Commons would pass it, but this will be an uphill battle. Parliament will convene on Saturday to vote on it, which will be only the fourth Saturday session in 80 years and the first since the Falkland Islands conflict in 1982. Johnson is seeking an up-or-down vote on Saturday to either reject or (he hopes) accept the deal, but opposition lawmakers are floating amendments, the most important of which would mandate a second nationwide referendum on Johnson\u2019s deal before it can be implemented.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the deal?\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit deal differs in several key respects from the one his predecessor Theresa May worked out with the E.U. last year, but failed to sell to Parliament on multiple occasions, leading to her resignation as head of the Conservative Party and Johnson replacing her. Most of the differences are aimed at placating right-wing proponents of a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d who had voted against May\u2019s plan because they felt it did not sufficiently decouple the U.K. from E.U.\n\nFor example, May had agreed to a \u201clevel playing field,\u201d essentially pledging not to water down the U.K.\u2019s consumer safety, environmental, or labor regulations so as to give U.K. businesses a leg up over European ones by substantially reducing their costs. May\u2019s deal would have seen the U.K. commit to matching E.U. standards in many areas going forward, allowing the country to quickly work out a free trade agreement with the bloc. Johnson\u2019s version strikes the level playing field language from the binding agreement and only mentions it in the nonbinding Political Declaration.\n\nThis gives Johnson\u2019s administration more flexibility to loosen regulations and negotiate its own trade deals outside the E.U., but means no quick and easy free trade agreement with the E.U. Erecting new trade barriers between the U.K. and the rest of Europe will be needlessly harmful to its economy, British business groups and economists have pointed out, but Johnson claims he will make up these losses and then some, primarily through a \u201cmagnificent\u201d Anglo-American trade deal, courtesy of his buddy Donald Trump.\n\nJohnson handles the Irish border problem \u2014 the thorniest issue throughout the past three years of Brexit negotiations \u2014 differently than his predecessor Theresa May tried to. May\u2019s deal included a backstop arrangement in case the parties failed to work out a permanent trade agreement by 2021, which would keep the U.K. in the E.U. customs union and maintain a mostly customs-free border by having Northern Ireland continue to abide by some of the E.U.\u2019s single-market regulations. Brexit proponents rejected this plan, arguing that remaining in the customs union and applying the backstop would leave the U.K. subject to E.U. trade policy indefinitely.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal, by contrast, removes the U.K. from the customs union entirely, but ends up putting many of the same burdens on Northern Ireland as May\u2019s did. It will have to abide by E.U. tariff rules and single-market regulations in agriculture and manufacturing. To accomplish this while removing the U.K. from the customs union, Johnson is effectively creating a customs border in the Irish Sea, between Northern Ireland and Britain, smoothed over with a system of rebates and exemptions. These rules will take effect at the end of a transition period in 2020, and Northern Irish lawmakers would get to vote on whether to keep applying the E.U. rules every four years starting in 2024. This feature eliminates one of the problems with May\u2019s backstop: that it included no set end date or process by which the U.K. could decide to stop enforcing it.\n\nWill the deal pass?\n\nJohnson\u2019s confidence notwithstanding, there\u2019s plenty for his opponents not to like in this deal. The opposition Labour Party is making hay out of the fact that Johnson did away with the \u201clevel playing field,\u201d which they see as a first step toward letting the pro-business Tories run roughshod over worker and environmental protections. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called Johnson\u2019s deal \u201ceven worse\u201d than May\u2019s and saying his party would push for it to be put to the public in a second referendum. Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, warned in a Twitter thread criticizing the deal that it \u201cpaves the way for a decade of deregulation\u201d and \u201cgives Johnson licence to slash workers\u2019 rights, environmental standards and consumer protections.\u201d\n\nThe far right is not pleased with the deal, either. English nationalist Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party (which holds no seats in Parliament) blasted the \u201ccommitment to regulatory alignment\u201d in the deal, which, although much weaker than what May had proposed, still renders it \u201cnot Brexit\u201d in Farage\u2019s eyes. Of course, Farage and those in his hard-line camp have been pushing for a no-deal Brexit in which the U.K. is completely and totally severed from the E.U. all at once, with no regard for the damage this would do to the economy or social stability.\n\nFor those hard Brexiteers who are actually seated in Parliament (and not complete no-deal wingnuts), however, the deal may be good enough \u2014 or at least, as good as it gets for them. Johnson\u2019s confidence that his deal will pass Parliament on Saturday is based largely in the fact that the European Research Group, a faction of hard-line Eurosceptic MPs within the Conservative party, has signaled that it will consider voting for it, pending the resolution of a few remaining concerns. Of course, recent history suggests that those lingering concerns could turn out to be insurmountable obstacles.\n\nThe Northern Irish DUP has said its MPs won\u2019t vote for the deal because of the way it handles the Irish border problem, which they still don\u2019t like. The DUP has consistently ruled out any Brexit deal that creates a separate set of customs rules for Northern Ireland relative to the rest of the U.K., requires that country to remain in the E.U. customs union, creates a customs border between it and the rest of the U.K., or creates a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. They rejected May\u2019s deal for violating the first and second of these rules, and now appear poised to reject Johnson\u2019s for violating the third. Of course, a deal that satisfies all of the DUP\u2019s conditions has been impossible all along, which is why May was foolish to ever count on the party\u2019s support in shepherding her deal through the House of Commons.\n\nFortunately for Johnson, he doesn\u2019t need the DUP to get his deal passed on Saturday. Unfortunately, he still needs a lot of other MPs who aren\u2019t especially enthusiastic about him or the deal to get onboard.\n\nThe parliamentary math isn\u2019t on his side. There are 639 voting members in the House of Commons (650 in total, minus the speaker and his three deputies, who don\u2019t vote, and seven MPs of the Irish nationalist party Sinn F\u00e9in, who never take their seats), so Johnson needs a flat majority of 320 to pass his deal. There are 288 Conservatives, most of whom will support the deal (particularly if the ERG decides it\u2019s acceptable); some of the 21 ex-Tories whom Johnson expelled from the party for voting against him last month will likely take this chance to come back into the fold. Most of Labour\u2019s 244 MPs will vote against, as will the DUP, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party, and other small opposition parties, accounting for another 83 seats altogether.\n\nThat leaves very little wiggle room for Johnson to get to 320: He needs all the Tories, plus most of the independents and perhaps a handful of Labour MPs as well. If Corbyn whips his party into voting against the deal unanimously and the DUP remains opposed, Johnson will need the votes of nearly every independent MP in the House. With less than two weeks left until doomsday, he is counting on lawmakers\u2019 fear of either another extension or a no-deal Brexit to get them in line. Will it be enough?
