Adam Schiff and whistleblower complaint takes an ominous new turn", "language": "en", "text": "Opinion writer\n\nThis story is about to get a whole lot more media scrutiny, because it involves secretive back-channel maneuvering, a possible threat to national security and potential lawbreaking at the highest levels of the Trump administration, possibly at the direction of President Trump himself \u2014 all with a whole lot of cloak-and-dagger intrigue thrown in.\n\nAnd now the mystery of Rep. Adam Schiff and the whistleblower has taken an ominous new turn, one that should only underscore concerns that serious \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 lawbreaking might be unfolding.\n\nAt the very least, we\u2019re seeing yet another serious erosion in checks on this administration\u2019s norm-shredding \u2014 and, as I hope to explain, there are big and important principles at stake here.\n\nThe latest development: The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has informed Schiff, the California Democrat and chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that he will not forward a whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the committee, as required by law.\n\nYet the legal rationale for refusing to do this appears specious \u2014 and raises further questions as to why this is happening at all.\n\nThis all started when Schiff announced that the Inspector General at the ODNI had alerted him to a whistleblower\u2019s complaint that had been submitted to him. Schiff noted that the IG assessed the complaint as \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nBut as Schiff noted, the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has not forwarded the complaint to the Intelligence Committee.\n\nThere is a process for whistleblowers in such situations, one that has been established by federal law. A whistleblower must first submit a complaint to the IG, who determines whether it\u2019s an \u201curgent concern\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d If so, the DNI \u201cshall\u201d forward the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nThe idea here is that this process allows a member of the intelligence community to raise concerns about potential lawbreaking or other abuses with Congress, so it can exercise oversight over those abuses, while ensuring that classified information remains protected. This is done via the independent inspector general at first, insulating the whistleblower against agency-head retaliation, which is also provided for in the statute.\n\nIn this case, Schiff announced, the inspector general notified the committee that this whistleblower\u2019s complaint did constitute an urgent concern and is credible \u2014 yet Maguire still hadn\u2019t forwarded the complaint and relevant associated materials to the committee.\n\nSo Schiff called on the DNI to forward the materials, and if he failed to do that, to appear before Congress on Thursday.\n\nNow Maguire has sent a new letter to Schiff once again refusing to forward the complaint.\n\nWhat the DNI is saying\n\nMaguire\u2019s stated rationale for this is that the complaint does not meet the definition of \u201curgent concern\u201d under the law, because it doesn\u2019t concern conduct by a person in the intelligence community or activity that falls under the DNI\u2019s supervision.\n\nBecause we don\u2019t know what the complaint entails, it\u2019s hard to evaluate this claim. But there are reasons for skepticism about this stated rationale.\n\nFor one thing, even if the conduct may not be under the DNI\u2019s supervision, the New York Times quotes informed sources saying the complaint itself was filed by a member of the intelligence community. That suggests direct relevance to the DNI.\n\nFor another, the inspector general did determine that the appropriate destination for the complaint is Congress\u2019 intelligence committees.\n\nMargaret Taylor, senior editor of the Lawfare Blog, told me this is important because the inspector general has his own counsel, who could have determined that this complaint falls in the category of something that should be forwarded to the committees under the statute.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Taylor argued, the statute does not give the DNI the authority to decide that something doesn\u2019t count as an urgent concern, once the inspector general has designated it as such.\n\n\u201cThe inspector general makes the decision as to whether it\u2019s an urgent concern or not,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cUnder the statute as written, the Director of National Intelligence doesn\u2019t have the discretion to not act or get a second opinion. He just has to forward it to the intelligence committees.\u201d\n\nThe principle that\u2019s at stake here\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the statute is written this way. As Taylor points out, lawmakers wanted whistleblowers to be able to alert them \u2014 that is, Congress, with its oversight authority \u2014 to wrongdoing without the threat that agency heads will tamper with that process, say, for nakedly political reasons.\n\n\u201cLawmakers decided that Congress\u2019 oversight responsibilities could not be effectively carried out if employees are required to obtain the approval of the heads of their agency before exposing wrongdoing,\u201d Taylor told me.\n\nThe DNI has offered another rationale as well, one that makes this potentially more troubling.\n\nOver the weekend, Schiff told CBS News that he\u2019d been informed by Maguire that he was not forwarding the complaint because he is \u201cbeing instructed not to\u201d by someone \u201cabove\u201d him, a \u201chigher authority.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be a reference to the DNI\u2019s suggestion, in a separate letter to the committee, that the complaint involves \u201cconfidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe executive branch seems to be relying on the potential assertion of executive privilege to not supply the information to Schiff,\u201d Taylor told me. One also wonders who outside the intelligence community is being referred to here as enjoying such privileged communications.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House, of course, has asserted various forms of presidential prerogative to block oversight on many fronts, including preventing Judiciary Committee Democrats from questioning multiple direct witnesses to Trump\u2019s extensive corruption and wrongdoing, as documented by the special counsel.\n\nAt stake here, then, is whether agency heads can further erode the process by which whistleblowers can report wrongdoing to Congress, and possibly whether presidential prerogative can once again be invoked to prevent Congress from exercising oversight over it.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re looking at still more erosion of checks on executive branch power and, possibly, lawlessness as well.\n\nRead more:\n\nHarry Litman: A whistleblower filed a complaint to the intelligence IG.
