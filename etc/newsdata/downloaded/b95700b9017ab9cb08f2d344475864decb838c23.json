Saudi officials have not confirmed the claim.\n\nThe operation was the largest of its kind since the conflict began, the spokesman said.\n\nColonel Yahiya Sarea said Saudi forces had suffered \"huge losses in life and machinery\".\n\nAll those captured would be paraded on the Houthi-run Al Masirah TV network on Sunday, he added.\n\nHouthis say they launched a drone and missile attack on Saudi oil facilities on 14 September which affected global markets.\n\nBut the Saudis - backed by the US, UK, France and Germany - have all publicly blamed Iran for the strike, allegations Tehran denies.\n\nWhat's the background?\n\nYemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his cabinet were forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis - which hold much of the north of the country.\n\nSaudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries in air strikes against the Iran-aligned rebels.\n\nThe coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive.\n\nMore than 70,000 people are believed to have died since 2016 as a result of the conflict, according to UN estimates.", "description": "Houthi insurgents say three brigades surrendered near the border, but there is no Saudi confirmation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12F8F/production/_109011777_056675123-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
