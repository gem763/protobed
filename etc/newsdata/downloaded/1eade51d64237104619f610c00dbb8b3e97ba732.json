Clinton Adviser Reines: \u2018Unlikely\u2019 Hillary Runs in 2020, But She Might Be Best to Beat Trump", "language": "en", "text": "On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d former Clinton adviser Philippe Reines stated that it is \u201cunlikely\u201d former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2020, but \u201cthere might be a reason that she\u2019d be the best person, not only to beat Donald Trump, but to govern after Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nReines began by saying that Hillary hasn\u2019t completely ruled out running in 2020, but later added that Hillary running is \u201cunlikely\u201d and he has greater odds of winning the Powerball than Hillary running in 2020.\n\nHe added, \u201cWell, look, this is a huge if, but if she were to jump in, for whatever reason, and the party has moved someplace that she hasn\u2019t, then she won\u2019t get the votes. That\u2019s the point of the primary. \u2026 I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s not running because she has any anxiety about the Democratic field. She really likes a lot of the people running. She knows them well. She thought about some of them for her vice presidency. But, there might be a reason that she\u2019d be the best person, not only to beat Donald Trump, but to govern after Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n(h/t Grabien)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Wednesday's broadcast of the Fox News Channel's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" former Clinton adviser Philippe Reines stated that it is \"unlikely\" former | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/05/Philippe-Reines-Drew-AngererGetty-Images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
