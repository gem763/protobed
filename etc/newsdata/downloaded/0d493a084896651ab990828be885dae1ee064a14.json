George Romney resigned to join President Richard Nixon\u2019s administration. Mr. Milliken subsequently won three elections but didn\u2019t run again in 1982, retiring from politics after 14 years as Michigan\u2019s chief executive.\n\nMr. Milliken was a moderate Republican who occasionally clashed with members of his own party but was popular with big-city Democrats, especially Coleman Young, Detroit\u2019s first black mayor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of his first acts was sending the Legislature a 20-point environmental agenda, ushering in a period that produced far-reaching ecological safeguards. Among them: the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, enabling citizens to sue polluters; protections for rivers, Great Lakes coastlines, wetlands and inland lakes; a deposit on soda and beer bottles; and limits on phosphorus in laundry detergent to help Lake Erie.\n\nMr. Milliken \u201cbelieved government should be about seeking solutions that bring people together, instead of political issues that divide,\u201d said William Rustem, who was his environmental adviser.\n\nProdded by his wife, Mr. Milliken helped broker a compromise that limited oil and gas drilling in the Pigeon River State Forest. He signed a 1972 law to create the Michigan Lottery, which remains a key source of cash for schools.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Milliken said in a 2006 interview that defending the environment was a \u201cnever-ending struggle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tragedy is that once we lose the beauty and the environmental values around us, we\u2019ve lost it forever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must come to understand these values and fight for them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Mr. Milliken\u2019s most surprising alliance was with Young, whose left-wing politics and combative style antagonized white conservatives. Mr. Milliken won over Young by supporting state aid to Detroit as the city struggled with racial strife, population loss and the auto industry\u2019s tailspin during the energy crisis of the 1970s.\n\nMr. Milliken faced a disaster in 1973 when a chemical company accidentally shipped fire retardant containing highly toxic polybrominated biphenyl, or PBB, instead of cattle feed to thousands of farmers. It took more than a year for state agriculture officials to determine the feed was tainted and several more months before action was taken that led to the slaughter of more than 1 million animals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFear spread over the health effects of eating contaminated animals, their milk or eggs. When Mr. Milliken went to the tiny community of Mio to talk to residents about burying slaughtered animals, he spoke \u201cwith his effigy (hanging) behind him and a near riot in front of him,\u201d biographer David Dempsey said.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mr. Milliken gave asylum to a young black man convicted of killing his abusive father in Arkansas. Lester Stiggers traveled to Michigan during a furlough from prison but refused to return. Mr. Milliken rejected requests to extradite him, citing, in part, the \u201ccruel and unusual treatment\u201d of blacks in Arkansas prisons.\n\nMr. Milliken\u2019s moderate style of Republican politics fell out of fashion in the decades after he left office. He endorsed Democrats Barack Obama and John Kerry for president and some other Democrats seeking statewide office in Michigan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not relevant any longer,\u201d Michigan Republican Party Chairman Bobby Schostak said in 2014, shrugging off the endorsements.\n\nBut many Republicans still sought Mr. Milliken\u2019s blessing, hoping an endorsement would appeal to independent and moderate voters. They included Rick Snyder, who was governor from 2011 to 2019.\n\nWilliam Grawn Milliken was born in Traverse City on March 26, 1922. He graduated from Yale University in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Forces. He received a Purple Heart and other medals during World War II after several harrowing missions that included bailing out of a damaged B-24 bomber.\n\nHe took a turn running Milliken\u2019s Department Store in Traverse City, founded in 1873 by his paternal grandfather.\n\nAD\n\nHis wife, the former Helen Wallbank, died in 2012. Their daughter Elaine Milliken died in 1993. Survivors include a son, William Milliken Jr.\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "The moderate Republican occasionally clashed with members of his own party but was popular with big-city Democrats, especially Coleman Young, Detroit\u2019s first black mayor.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uCPKZOkfkhLIyWjNnQL9I1YP_Q8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4IBW47HSMUI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
