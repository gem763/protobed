REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\n\n(Reuters) - The leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Northern Irish party which backs British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government, said the party will not support a Brexit deal that \u201cdivides the internal market of the UK\u201d.\n\nArlene Foster\u2019s response came as the Times newspaper reported the DUP has agreed to accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules after Brexit as part of a deal to replace the Irish backstop, potentially opening the door to a withdrawal agreement.\n\n\"UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that divides the internal market of the UK. We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.
