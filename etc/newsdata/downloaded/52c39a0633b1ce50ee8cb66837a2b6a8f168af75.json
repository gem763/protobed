You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will. I\u2019ve already given you a little sample with respect to Pastor Brunson,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter, referring to sanctions the Treasury Department previously imposed on senior Turkish officials for the detention of an American evangelical clergyman.\n\n\u201cI have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don\u2019t let the world down. You can make a great deal,\u201d he continued, adding that Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani of the Syrian Democratic Forces \u201cis willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen,\u201d the president concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nThe letter is dated last Wednesday, October 9 \u2014 the same day Erdo\u011fan tweeted that Turkey had begun its offensive into Syria. The White House had announced in a weekend statement three days earlier that Turkey would \u201csoon be moving forward with its long-planned operation.\u201d", "description": "Trump apparently sent the letter after receiving fierce blowback for clearing the way for Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1181522982-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
