But while they include some Islamic extremists and past members of some Syrian rebel factions, many are Arab and Turkmen fighters from northern and eastern Syria who have an ax to grind against the Kurds and a reputation for violence and looting.\n\n\u201cThe main problem with these forces is their criminality,\u201d said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute who has interviewed dozens of the fighters and said they appear to be driven by a desire for power and money rather than by any specific ideology.\n\n\u201cHatred of Kurds, a sense of Arab chauvinism, complete intolerance for any dissent, and just a desire to make a profit is what\u2019s driving most of the abuses,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Turkey began funding the force in 2016, its fighters have yet to battle Assad\u2019s troops.\n\nInstead, they have mostly fought in Turkey\u2019s cross-border offensives against the Islamic State group and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia that had partnered with the United States and battled IS extremists with far greater success.\n\nIn the latest offensive, the Turkish-led Syrian forces have pushed deep into northeastern Syria, an ethnically and religiously mixed region, raising fears of ethnic conflict and human rights abuses. Some of the factions allied with Turkey have been accused of banditry, and others include hard-line Islamic militants in their ranks.\n\nTurkey views the Kurdish militia that forms the core of the SDF as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish fighters who have waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. After threatening for months to invade northeastern Syria and carve out a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border, Turkey launched an offensive last week after Trump cleared the way for it by moving U.S. troops out of the way.\n\nAs the situation on the ground descends into chaos and Syrian government troops move north to lend support to their former foes, the Kurds, Turkey\u2019s Syrian fighters are pouring across the border from Turkey, posting videos in which they threaten Kurdish \u201cpigs\u201d and \u201catheists.\u201d\n\nBacked by Turkish airstrikes and artillery, the fighters have provided the bulk of the ground forces and taken the most casualties. At least 16 Syrian fighters have been killed compared to four Turkish soldiers since the operation began last week.\n\nOver the weekend they captured a major highway that runs across northern Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said the Turkey-backed fighters shot and killed six civilians along the road, including Hevreen Khalaf, a woman who led a Kurdish political party.\n\nIn a video circulated online, fighters can be seen rushing toward a bullet-ridden armored vehicle, saying they have captured a \u201cpig.\u201d A woman\u2019s faint voice can be heard from within, saying she is the head of a political party. The video indicates Khalaf was captured alive and later died or was killed.\n\nA U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details, said \u201cextremist Turkish proxies\u201d had advanced along the highway, setting up checkpoints where they posed as Kurdish fighters and killed civilians.\n\nIn a series of tweets, one of the Turkey-backed groups, known as Ahrar al-Sharqiya, posted pictures of two supposed Kurdish fighters it said it had captured. Another video posted online showed the Syrian fighters screaming \u201cGod is greatest!\u201d as they fired several rounds into a bound prisoner who resembled one of the captured men in the previous video.\n\nA spokesman for Ahrar al-Sharqiya, Al-Harith Rabah, said his force had set up a checkpoint on the highway and fired at those who refused to stop. He said the man killed in the video was a Kurdish fighter in civilian clothes who had fought until he ran out of ammunition. He said the Turkey-backed force is investigating the shooting and had summoned the gunmen for questioning.\n\n\u201cWe provided proof they were armed men,\u201d Rabah told The Associated Press. \u201cAnyone on the battlefield, when there is resistance, one is obligated to react and deal with those who resist.\u201d\n\nTurkish officials did not respond to a request for comment on the Syrian forces, some of whom are heard using religious language in some of the videos, even borrowing slogans from the IS group.\n\nAt least some of the factions include Islamic extremists. The Rojava Information Center, an activist collective in the Kurdish-held areas, has identified at least 40 former IS militants among the Turkey-backed fighters. Tsurkov said one faction is made up of fighters from Idlib, a stronghold for an al-Qaida-linked group, who are \u201cless prone to criminality and just straight-up extremists.\u201d\n\nThat bodes ill for northeastern Syria, home to a patchwork of Kurdish, Christian and other minority communities that have already suffered throughout the rise of IS and the devastating war that dismantled its self-styled caliphate.\n\nThe U.N. said more than 130,000 people have fled since the Turkish operation began. As Syrian Kurdish forces fall back, there are fears that those who remain will end up like the residents of Afrin, a Kurdish enclave in northwestern Syria seized by Turkey and its Syrian allies early last year.\n\nRights groups say the Turkish-backed fighters looted and destroyed the property of Kurdish civilians in Afrin. Last month, a U.N. commission said the overall security situation in and around Afrin \u201cremained dire \u201d as armed groups carved out their own fiefdoms. The Rojava Information Center said some factions have imposed a strict form of Islamic law.\n\n\u201cThere is a general absence of rule of law and repeated incidents of kidnappings, torture, extortion and assassination,\u201d the U.N. commission said, adding that victims were \u201coften of Kurdish origin as well as civilians perceived as being prosperous, including doctors, businessmen and merchants.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKrauss reported from Jerusalem.", "description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Syrian fighters vowed to kill \"pigs\" and \"infidels,\" paraded their Kurdish captives in front of cameras and, in one graphic video, fired", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/4c0e8b_syria-turkey-syrian-army-20320-in-monday-oct-2019-file-photo-turkish-backed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
