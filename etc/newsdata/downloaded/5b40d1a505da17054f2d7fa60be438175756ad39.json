I didn\u2019t notice that he was behind me, because I left him there playing with his mother\u2019s phone. And just when I got to my cottage and was closing the door behind me, I heard screams coming from outside,\" he reportedly said.\n\nNtimane reportedly said that he rushed out to see what the commotion was about and found his son hanging from the leopard's jaws.

We wish them strength and will give them all the support they need as an organisation,\" News24 reported.\n\nLeopard shot dead\n\nThe park said it was \"an unfortunate risk that staff experience when having to live and work in environments like the KNP. These events are very rare occurrences, but always tragic when they do occur\".\n\nIt said that a team of rangers had hunted the leopard down and shot it.\n\n\"Immediately upon hearing of the incident, the section ranger, his lance corporal - with help from the regional ranger - went out to search for the animal. The offending animal was found and shot dead to remove the danger of another person falling victim.\n\n\"In parks like the KNP, predators do interact with tourists and staff, and at times it may result in species like leopard getting habituated to people and losing their fear,\" the park said.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\nNews24 on Twitter", "description": "The father of two-year-old Courtney Ntimane, who was killed by a leopard in the Kruger National Park, has described his pain over the horrific attack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5491/ecc5a2c6617b430e864408f250ea37bd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-07"}
