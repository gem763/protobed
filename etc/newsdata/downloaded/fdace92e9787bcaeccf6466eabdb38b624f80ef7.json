Facebook created a subsidiary \u2013 Calibra \u2013 that will operate a wallet service on top of the Libra network, and while Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won\u2019t see financial data from Calibra.\u2019", "description": "The virtual currency has nosedived after Mark Zuckerberg appeared at a Senate hearing yesterday.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1140163646_1571916586.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
