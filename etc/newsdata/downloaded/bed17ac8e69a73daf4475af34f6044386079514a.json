Well, this is exactly what Houston Astros superfan Jim McIngvale, a 68-year-old furniture store owner, is doing \u2013 and not for the first time.\n\n\u2018Mattress Mack\u2019 Bets the Store on Houston Astros World Series Odds\n\nAffectionately known as \u201cMattress Mack,\u201d McIngvale set a state record when he first made a $3.5 million bet at a Mississippi casino on the Houston Astros winning this year\u2019s World Series. The odds for this wager are +220, so he stands to make a $7.7 million profit.\n\nHe then tried to place a $5 million bet on the Astros with the FanDuel sportsbook in New Jersey. In the end, the sportsbook would only accept a $1.5 million bet from the Houston businessman, allowing him to potentially score a $3.3 million payday.\n\nMcIngvale also placed significant bets on the Astros with a number of Las Vegas sportsbooks. In total, he\u2019s rumored to have put down $10 million on his hometown team and stands to net $20 million if they win the World Series.\n\nWhen he was asked about his decision to bet as much as $10 million on this single outcome, McIngvale responded by saying, \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t afford to lose it, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d According to estimates, he is worth in the region of $75 million.\n\nFan Will Pay $10 Million if Astros Lose World Series \u2013 And Even More If They Win\n\nOne of the reasons why he is staking so much money is because it is part of a hedging strategy for his business.\n\nHis mattress store is running a tantalizing promotion for customers, offering 100% refunds on mattress purchases worth $3,000 or more if the Houston Astros win the World Series.\n\nMcIngvale estimates an Astros victory could cost him as much as $15 million, eating the vast majority of his sportsbook profits.\n\nHouston\u2019s \u201cmattress king\u201d ran a similar promotion when the Astros won the World Series in 2017. That historic victory \u2013 the first in the team\u2019s history \u2013 cost him $12 million in refunds. Not that he\u2019s complaining:\n\n\u201cI know these wacky promotions like this one, when people get their money back, it\u2019s the greatest publicity I could ever hope for,\u201d McIngvale said.\n\nSportsbooks List Astros as World Series Favorites\n\nMost sportsbooks have the Houston Astros as the odds-on favorites to win the World Series in 2019. Next in the rankings are the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Astros are out in front of the betting mainly due to their potent starting pitching lineup.\n\nThe Houston Astros begin their quest for the title today, Oct. 4, in the best-of-five ALDS series against the Tampa Bay Rays.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/houston-astros-team-usa-today.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
