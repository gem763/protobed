Do you chase them away, ask them to change or simply continue with the wedding?\n\nWe take a look at four brides who had to go through this frustrating situation this year so far:\n\nBride 1 \u2013 The sister of the bride\n\nThis bride didn't take it too kindly when her sister, who was her maid of honour, gave her speech at her wedding. During her speech, she brought up her depression and how the groom had supported her through it.\n\nThe bride was upset and speaking of her frustration on Reddit she said, \"Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. Ninety percent of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how \u201cstrong\u201d she was. Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding!\"\n\nAfter the guests all greeted the bride\u2019s sister, she asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish as there is a time and place for everything.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: This maid of honour intentionally ruined her best friend\u2019s wedding, here's why she doesn\u2019t regret it\n\nBride 2 \u2013 The pregnant bridesmaid with a handsome husband\n\nThis bride had spent 3 years planning for the wedding and a friend of hers getting married and falling pregnant wasn\u2019t part of the plan. As a married bridesmaid, bringing your husband should not even be a question but what happens when he\u2019s too \u2018beautiful\u2019?\n\nWell, this bride demanded one of her bridesmaids pay her $30 000 (nearly R420 000) for a wedding do over after her pregnant belly and attractive husband stole the limelight at her wedding.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Speak now or forever hold your peace' - here are 5 times someone has actually objected at a wedding\n\nBride 3 \u2013 The ex-girlfriend\n\nThe last thing any bride wants is to have unwanted guests showing up, especially your new husband\u2019s ex-girlfriend wearing a white wedding gown. At this wedding, the goom's ex-girlfriend reportedly burst into the ceremony at the point where the bride and groom were about to share their first kiss as husband and wife. Kneeling down she asked the groom for a second chance.\n\nFurious, the bride ran out of the ceremony and her husband followed her, leaving the ex-girlfriend on the stage weeping with her face in her hands.\n\nREAD MORE: PICS: Bride shocks wedding guests with 63kg weight loss for her big day\n\nBride 4 \u2013 The Mother-in-law\n\nThis mother-in-law showed up at her son's wedding wearing a wedding gown that was suspiciously similar to the cut of the bride's wedding gown. She wore a sweetheart neckline, figure-hugging mermaid gown that grabbed everyone's attention.\n\nIt is unclear how this bride handled this situation, however, wearing a 'white wedding gown' to someone else's wedding is obvs one of the worst faux pars anyone can make.\n\nWhat would you do if someone tried to upstage you at your wedding?
