Biogen Inc. stunned investors with its surprise Alzheimer\u2019s drug submission on Tuesday, reviving hopes for an experimental medicine that investors had mostly left for dead. Shares surged a record 42% on Tuesday, and at least one analyst says they may have room to go.\n\nSVB Leerink analyst Geoff Porges estimates the stock could rise to the $400-range as investors warm up to the drug\u2019s prospects. If approved, the treatment, known as aducanumab, could price the stock as high as $485-$525, he wrote.\n\nStill, despite the newfound optimism, Porges and other Wall Street analysts have cautioned that FDA approval is far from a done deal. Here\u2019s what they\u2019re saying:\n\nRBC, Brian Abrahams\n\n\u201cSomewhat incredibly,\u201d Biogen reported clinical activity from its Phase 3 Alzheimer\u2019s drug, aducanumab, which had been halted back in March. It\u2019s still unclear whether the data would meet the bar for FDA approval or broader commercial adoption, Abrahams said.\n\nNew data in Biogen\u2019s earnings slides indicate a \u201cshakier ground\u201d for aducanumab\u2019s prospects, the analyst wrote. The data from the \u201cEngage\u201d study, which did not reach its primary goal but which Biogen had indicated as supportive for the filing, show that at the high dose, the medicine did not show any benefit and even worsened symptoms for some patients.\n\n\u201cThough FDA apparently provided some endorsement for the idea of filing, which could maintain some probability of approvability, we believe the new details suggest the data may be more mixed than initially perceived,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSector perform, PT $236\n\nCowen, Phil Nadeau\n\nBiogen\u2019s \u201crationale makes sense, but it\u2019s unclear to us if the totality of the data support FDA approval,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cNonetheless, as people had thought BIIB\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s program was not viable today\u2019s news suggests that there may still be a path to market.\u201d\n\nOutperform, PT $275\n\nSVB Leerink, Geoffrey Porges\n\n\u201cAt first pass the results still appear to be marginal, with inconsistent treatment effects between the two studies and for different endpoints, but the critical question will be what reassurance the company has received from the FDA,\u201d the analyst wrote. \u201cThis could range from \u2019the agency has reviewed all the data with us and has guaranteed approval\u2019 to \u2019you can file whatever you want and we\u2019ll review it\u2019.\u201d\n\nBiogen\u2019s filing will now come down to a \u201ctorturous discussion\u201d of data, statistics, treatment effects and safety liabilities and will likely not include the societal and economic costs of further studying the devastating disease.\n\nShares could trade in the $400 range as investors give \u201cpartial\u201d credit for aducanumab, Porges estimates. Full value for the drug probably prices the stock as high as $485-$525, he wrote.\n\nMarket perform, PT $256\n\nJefferies, Michael Yee\n\nInvestors and analysts will continue to debate the potential approval but its drug submission makes it another binary outcome for shares next year. The stock is now pricing in around a 35%-50% chance as it is back to $300 and where it was around the time before the drug failed, the analyst said.\n\nYee also agrees it makes sense for Biogen to file and try to get the drug approved since it has done the work and spent money on studies. \u201cThere is some argument FDA might accept all of this data given the significant unmet need, but our questions would be mostly on how convincing is the data for FDA,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHold, PT $255\n\nEvercore ISI, Umer Raffat\n\n\u201cUltimately, I realize there are lots of cuts of data here ... given the unmet need and the signal seen in high dose EMERGE, its not inconceivable that FDA is open to this filing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, whether FDA approval means major commercial acceptance is a whole different debate.\u201d\n\nQuestioned whether the departure of Biogen\u2019s head of R&D earlier this month was related to the new data. Raffat notes Biogen\u2019s earnings call suggested that\u2019s not the case.\n\nOutperform\n\nCiti, Mohit Bansal\n\nGiven the stock move today, consensus estimates are implying about $3 billion in adjusted sales for aducanumab to Biogen. As a reminder, the biotech firm takes roughly half of total sales, given its partnership with Japan\u2019s Eisai Co.\n\n$3 billion to $4 billion in peak sales would take Biogen\u2019s fair value to $345-$375 a share\n\n(Updates shares, adds Evercore, Citi remarks)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tatiana Darie in New York at tdarie1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Scott Schnipper\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Nobody saw it coming.
