They\u2019re also very old games that have spawned newer, flashier imitators, and they show their age.\n\nThis definitely makes them a little less appealing at first blush, but it\u2019s worth stressing: If you\u2019ve never played any of these before, it\u2019s worth taking the time to experience them.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate and Baldur\u2019s Gate II, developed by BioWare, and Planescape: Torment, developed byBlack Isle Studios, are computer role-playing games created by what were, at the time, dream teams of RPG designers at the top of their game. 1998\u2019s Baldur\u2019s Gate in particular revived and perfected the style of RPG that sought to closely emulate the experience of Dungeons & Dragons \u2014 wherein you gather a party of colourful characters and venture out into the world, taking on monsters and confronting moral dilemmas.\n\nOne year later, Planescape: Torment bent that format into something more narratively ambitious, where fighting was allowed but it was more interesting to talk, to read, to ponder over dialogue and wonder how characters were connected. Torment, to this day, is widely regarded as one of the best video game stories ever told.\n\nAn increased development focus on consoles killed much of the momentum built by these games at the tail end of the \u201890s, even as Baldur\u2019s Gate II released to even greater acclaim in 2000. As publisher Interplay ceased operation, the games went out of print and became difficult to run on modern hardware without fan mods. For a while, you could get them, but it took a lot of work \u2014 until 2012, when Beamdog Interactive began releasing Enhanced Editions of these classic games for modern devices, including smartphones and tablets.\n\nTwenty-one years later, it certainly helps that the newest ports are \u2014 at least on PlayStation 4 \u2014 surprisingly excellent, taking games designed for a boxy CRT monitor and refitting them to play well on my flatscreen and work with a controller. There\u2019s some clunkiness \u2014 a lot of how you play these games involves navigating menus full of items and abilities and indicating where you\u2019d like them to take effect, and that will always be clumsy on anything that\u2019s not a mouse and keyboard. That said, I did play Baldur\u2019s Gate on an iPad a few years ago, and while it was less than ideal, I played nearly the whole damn game.\n\nPlanescape: Torment (Screenshot: Beamdog)\n\nAs officially licensed Dungeons & Dragons games, they take settings previously published for tabletop campaigns in the late \u201890s and use them as the backdrop for epic single-player adventures. I did not know this for years until I finally played them, and knowing that is important for understanding what makes them special.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s about limitations. A hallmark of tabletop role-playing has always been liberation, the way players are free to dream up and take part in adventure in ways that more rigid media like, say, video games couldn\u2019t really allow for. While Baldur\u2019s Gate is far from the first video game take on D&D (it\u2019s not even among the first dozen) it kicked off an era of video games that achieved the platonic ideal of D&D-style role-playing, no dungeon master needed.\n\nBy this I mean: They told stories, good ones, in which the player felt they were truly taking part. Your decisions didn\u2019t just matter, they coloured the tenor of your experience far beyond the good/evil/neutral trinary of modern big-budget RPGs. They let you get inventive the way you could in a game of Dungeons & Dragons, tackling encounters however you liked as long as the dice rolled in your favour.\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate cast players as Gorion\u2019s Ward, an orphan raised in a monastic life under the care of the scribe Gorion, suddenly thrust into the wider world when they learn that their real heritage might be connected to something monstrous. Of these three games, it\u2019s the most straightforward, about going on a grand adventure and learning something about yourself. In Baldur\u2019s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, you\u2019re asked a more complicated question: Now that you know what you are, what are you going to do about it?\n\nIn Planescape: Torment, you\u2019re The Nameless One, an immortal man stripped of his memories on a quest to piece his long life back together. Like It\u2019s A Wonderful Life in reverse, you slowly become aware of all the lives you have touched in your journeys, and must deal with the fact that your personal history might have been an awful one.\n\nAll three of these games deal with themes of legacy and memory, which is potent fodder for a video game narrative. Games are about interesting decisions, the stories told by the choices that we make in them. Baldur\u2019s Gate and Planescape: Torment make this a literal part of the stories they tell, with a level of nuance rarely seen in games before them and since.\n\nIn their spiritual successors like Dragon Age: Origins or Mass Effect, the stories are about how much you mean to the world. In Baldur\u2019s Gate and Planescape: Torment, it\u2019s more about how you shape your character in response to these worlds. They resonate all the more for it.", "description": "With today\u2019s releases of Baldur\u2019s Gate games and Planescape: Torment for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, some of the most influential video games of the last 20 years complete a very long journey to the kind of wide audience they\u2019ve long existed just outside.
