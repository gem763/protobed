But the hearing armed Democrats with what they see as key ammunition in their drive toward impeachment of the president.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) suggested that Lewandowski\u2019s refusal to answer questions about his conversations with Trump \u2014 at the behest of the White House \u2014 bolsters Democrats\u2019 case to impeach the president, even as Speaker Nancy Pelosi remains opposed to the idea.\n\n\u201cWhen you refuse to answer these questions, you are obstructing the work of our committee. You are also proving our point for the American people to see: the president is intent on obstructing our legitimate oversight. You are aiding him in that obstruction,\u201d Nadler told Lewandowski.\n\n\u201cAnd I will remind you that Article 3 of the impeachment against President Nixon was based on obstruction of Congress,\u201d Nadler added.\n\nTwo White House lawyers were seated behind an indignant Lewandowski as he repeatedly deferred to their demands to sharply restrict his testimony to what was already made public in Mueller\u2019s 448-page report. Each time, Democrats grew more outraged as Lewandowski refused to discuss his conversations with the president, reciting a prepared statement from the White House.\n\n\u201cMr. Lewandowski, you are like a fish being cleaned with a spoon \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to get an answer out of you,\u201d Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) quipped.\n\n\u201cThis is House Judiciary, not a house party,\u201d Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) added.\n\nOne Democrat, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, became so frustrated that he asked Nadler, to move to hold Lewandowski in contempt of Congress.\n\nLewandowski more freely answered Republicans\u2019 questions, at times launching an all-out defense of Trump and adopting Trump\u2019s own harsh criticisms of the myriad congressional and criminal investigations that have ensnared him and his associates.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear the investigation was populated by many Trump haters who had their own agenda \u2014 to try and take down a duly elected president of the United States,\u201d Lewandowski told the committee, in what top Democrats said was their first official \u201cimpeachment hearing.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/96/1155968404_6087175946001_6087174069001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\n\u201cAs for actual \u2018collusion,\u2019 or conspiracy,\u2019 there was none. What there has been however, is harassment of the president from the day he won the election,\u201d Lewandowski continued.\n\nThough Democrats struggled to glean new information from Lewandowski, his appearance was a small victory for the committee, which had yet to obtain public testimony from any eyewitness to the potential obstruction of justice episodes detailed in Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nDemocrats were also hopeful that Lewandowski\u2019s refusal to answer many questions would be seen as evidence of what Nadler has long emphasized: that obstruction of Congress, too, can be an impeachable offense.\n\n\u201cYour behavior in this hearing room has been unacceptable,\u201d Nadler told him.\n\nThe hearing\u2019s tensest moment came at the outset, when Lewandowski repeatedly refused to answer basic questions from Nadler (D-N.Y.) about his conversations with the president \u2014 regardless of whether they were cited in the Mueller report \u2014 and the hearing devolved into a shouting match between Republicans and Democrats on the panel.\n\nAt one point, Lewandowski refused to answer a basic question about an Oval Office meeting he had with Trump, which was cited in the Mueller report. Lewandowski requested to view a copy of the report to confirm the meeting in question, prompting Democratic members of the committee to shake their heads and groan in disapproval.\n\nLewandowski sat for an April 6, 2018, interview with Mueller, according to the special counsel\u2019s report, providing an eyewitness account of an effort by Trump to constrain Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller obtained notes, emails and even LinkedIn exchanges.\n\nIn 2017, Trump deputized Lewandowski to approach then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and order him to either restrict Mueller\u2019s probe to future interference by Russia or be removed from his Cabinet post. Lewandowski, though, told Mueller he didn\u2019t want to deliver that message to Sessions, so he asked former top White House aide Rick Dearborn to pass it along instead. Dearborn never followed through, Mueller found.\n\nIn his analysis of the episode, Mueller found that Trump\u2019s actions met all the criteria that would typically result in an obstruction of justice charge. But Mueller also indicated that this team had determined at the outset not to judge whether Trump had committed a crime, owing in large part to a longstanding Justice Department opinion that says a sitting president is immune from indictment.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\nLewandowski largely confirmed the version of events contained in Mueller\u2019s report, at times complying with Democrats\u2019 line of questioning by agreeing with the way Mueller\u2019s report characterized his actions and responses to Trump\u2019s directives.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Lewandowski teased his aggressive posture toward the committee\u2019s Democrats, including a hashtag \u201cSenate2020\u201d on Twitter, a reference to his prospective challenge to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) in his home state. Some Democrats criticized him for using the hearing as publicity for his potential Senate bid \u2014 a chance to more closely align with Trump, rather than dish on potential crimes.\n\nDuring a break in the hearing, Lewandowski tweeted a link to a website for Stand with Corey, a new super PAC that filed with the Federal Election Commission earlier Tuesday. Lewandowski said it was a \u201cwebsite just launched to help a potential Senate run.\u201d The organization will be run by three veteran Republican operatives: Michael Biundo, John Brabender and Marty Obst, POLITICO confirmed.\n\n\"There's clearly a grassroots movement dedicated to recruiting Corey Lewandowski for the Senate, and we believe that it's time to draft Corey into this race and show that the voters of New Hampshire are behind him,\u201d Biundo told WMUR, which first reported details of the super PACs organizers.\n\nTrump himself tweeted support for Lewandowski just moments after he completed his opening remarks.\n\n\u201cSuch a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nLewandowski has a history of combativeness with House Democrats in previous congressional testimony. He refused to answer a slew of questions when he faced the House Intelligence Committee last year behind closed doors.\n\nTwo other Mueller witnesses on the committee\u2019s schedule \u2014 Dearborn and former White House staff secretary Rob Porter \u2014 both declined to appear under orders from the White House that were issued late Monday. The White House cited \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d in ordering them not to testify. Lewandowski was also ordered to not discuss his conversations with the president, other than those detailed in the Mueller report.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/640/1155968404_6087133819001_6087138721001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nNadler assailed the White House\u2019s effort to block or restrict the three men\u2019s testimony as another example of \u201cobstruction\u201d by the president and his administration.\n\nFor the White House, Tuesday's hearing is the latest effort to block former advisers from cooperating with Congress. The White House has offered various reasons that former aides cannot testify \u2014 including that top presidential advisers have \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from appearing before Congress and, in turn, cannot answer questions about the obstruction of justice allegations contained in the 448-page Mueller report. It applied this rationale to Dearborn and Porter.\n\nLewandowski never held a formal role in the Trump administration, but has served as an outside adviser to the president \u2014 and the White House cited that relationship in ordering him not to disclose the contents of his private conversations with the president, other than what has already been publicly revealed in Mueller\u2019s report. The White House has cited a longstanding Justice Department opinion that says even informal advisers can be shielded from testimony since the president should be able to rely on their confidential advice.\n\nNadler said on Monday that he considered Lewandowski\u2019s testimony to be an \u201cimpeachment hearing,\u201d a remark that comes as Democratic leaders continue to openly disagree on what to call the committee\u2019s impeachment probe.\n\nJames Arkin and Darren Samuelsohn contributed reporting.", "description": "The former Trump campaign manager offered a full-throated defense of the president.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3808/1155968404_6087153035001_6087154269001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
