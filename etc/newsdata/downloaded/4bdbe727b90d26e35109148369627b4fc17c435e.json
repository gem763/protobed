The absence of the U.S. military has created a power vacuum in the region, allowing Russia to absorb the Kurdish forces and extend their influence in the area.\n\nTrump's comments come as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travel to Turkey later today to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan has rejected U.S. calls for a cease-fire in the escalating Syria conflict ahead of a meeting.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about Pence's upcoming meeting with Turkey, Trump expressed little concern and minimized the U.S.'s role in resolving the conflict.\n\n\"Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe,\" Trump said. \"They've got to work it out. Maybe they can do it without fighting.\"\n\nTrump also brushed off reports that the some members Islamic State have escaped from captivity.\n\n\"By the way, everybody hates ISIS,\" Trump said. \"Some were released just for effect to make it look like 'oh jee, we gotta get back in there.'\"", "description": "The president told reporters that Kurdish forces are \"no angels\" and not America's responsibility.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4238526/1000x563_nbc-191007-donald-trump-recep-tayyip-erdogan-cs-114p_4f7fd79f6e7478f7ef79c534dd6ab2d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
