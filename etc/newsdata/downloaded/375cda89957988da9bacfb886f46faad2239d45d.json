On little to no money.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFailed St Kilda auction sounds the alarm for Block 2019 auction\n\nEP 47/48 recap: Tess and Luke\u2019s marriage fears\n\nAs judges Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer toured one unfinished room after another, Neale quipped: \u201cThis used to be a renovation show but it\u2019s become a test of human endurance.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. Everyone has been pushed to the brink by the massive task they were given. As if taking a leaf from Jesse\u2019s book of unabashed self-confidence, Tess commented that she wasn\u2019t as pretty as she used to be because of the stress caused by this week alone on The Block.\n\nTry as everyone did to get the work done to impress the judges and win that all important $10,000 and a weekend away, it came down to a two-horse race between Jesse and Mel and Mitch and Mark, simply because they came closest to getting their properties done.\n\nAs usual, Tess and Luke lagged behind the pack and got the least amount of work finished at their place. Despite their budget constraints and the regular lectures from Cam about overspending, the Cairns couple managed to convert their formal lounge into a dining room and channel natural light down into their dark kitchen through a glass floor and skylights in the two levels above.\n\nShaynna pointed out that walking across the glass floor in the media room could be a risky move. Not because she was fearful of falling through but because she was worried about giving those below an eyeful up her skirt. Although, in St Kilda, some real estate buyers may see such opportunities for flesh-flaunting as an asset rather than a deterrent.\n\nThe award for hardest working contestant this week, however, would have to go to Jesse. The fast-talking real estate agent managed to lay 100 square metres of chevron flooring by himself this week on top of completing a media room, wine cellar, stairwell and laundry.\n\n\u201cI think we have the most beautiful flooring on The Block, but it is the hardest thing to do,\u201d he boasted. \u201cIt is like a game of Sudoku trying to get the right piece in that little square and then turning it left and right and upside down. It is so hard.\u201d\n\nAlthough the judges were floored by his efforts, he was ultimately pipped at the post by Mitch and Mark\u2019s glamorous boudoir which Mitch had playfully styled to look as though it had been graced by Kate Moss. Apparently.\n\nThe boys\u2019 win did not go down well with Jesse and Mel.\n\n\u201cKate Moss? Whatever! People aren\u2019t going to buy a house because there\u2019s a fur coat on the bed and a bag,\u201d Mel raged.\n\nAnd Jesse agreed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care less about that (the glamorous styling) but I would walk into a house and say: \u2018I am not going to buy this because I have been sick on the floor as it looks like a public toilet!\u2019\n\n\u201cI am really glad that they\u2019ve made the decision they did with the floor plan because I think it\u2019s taken them out of the competition and everyone else is in a better position to win.\u201d\n\nThe reason Jesse is describing Mitch and Mark\u2019s place as a toilet block is their controversial decision to tile the bottom of their stairs in navy and white stripes.\n\nThe judges also considered it a rare styling fail, likening it to looking like police tape cordoning off a crime scene.\n\nIt was Jesse\u2019s $5,000 hallway wine cellar that left the worst taste in the judges\u2019 mouths.\n\nNeale remarked it would prove to be a polarising move for buyers because many might view it as \u201costentatious\u201d to display one\u2019s alcohol collection so prominently. There may, too, be some buyers who aren\u2019t keen to let the world know that they\u2019re serving a cheap bottle of plonk with dinner rather than a vintage Grange.\n\nThe judges were also left cold by Jesse and Mel\u2019s decision to display a large black safe so prominently in their media room, arguing that it would have been better placed discreetly inside a bedroom wardrobe.\n\nBut Jesse has never been one for discretion and he wears the description of his \u201costentatious\u201d styling choices as a badge of honour.\n\nTo his mind the people who would want to buy his house would love to let all and sundry know that they drink fancy wine and give the impression they have enough wealth to warrant an easily accessible safe on site.\n\nThat is, people just like Jesse.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\nEP 47/48 recap: Tess and Luke\u2019s marriage fears\n\n\n\nEP 46: Mitch and Jesse go head to head\n\n\n\nEP 45 recap: Judges slam pathetic balcony\n\n\n\n\n\nEP 43/44 recap : Has Mel had enough of her \u2018worst boyfriend\u2019\n\nEP 42 recap: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
