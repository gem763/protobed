I don't think the boys knew each other.\n\n'Soon after midnight loads of police cars and ambulances arrived in the road and there were blue lights everywhere. I have been told that the boys who died were not related in anyway and that the murders look a bit like gang violence.\n\nAmbulance and police crews attended Archford Croft (pictured above) after reports that a stabbing had taken place\n\n'This is normally a nice quiet neighbourhood and hardly anything ever happens here. I just can't believe that two teenage boys have been viciously murdered in our street,' said the neighbour.\n\nOther neighbours in Archford Croft said said that the four bedroomed homes in the road where the killings happened were currently selling for \u00a3360,000 and not the \u00a3600,000 originally estimated.\n\nAnother added: 'It is really unusual in this road to hear any noise in the evening so when I heard what sounded like a serious altercation taking place, I decided to call the police immediately.\n\n'The police and ambulances were here within minutes of my call and I saw a couple of dozen young people coming out of the house as the police went in. It was a very ususual scene for this place which is normally so quiet'.\n\nA Home Office pathologist was due to carry out post mortem examinations on the bodies of both boys at the mortuary at Milton Keynes Hospital although police confirmed that both had stab wounds.\n\nOfficers refused to say which hospital the stabbed adults had been taken to because of fears for their safety. Head of Crime Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said the force was in the early stages of a double murder investigation after the 'shocking incident'.\n\n'Our priorities at this time are to conduct a thorough investigation and to support those who have been affected. Officers are currently at the scene which has been cordoned off and members of the public are asked to avoid the area.\n\n'I would like to speak to anyone who has any information which could help with our enquiries or anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of Archford Croft at around the time of the incident around midnight.\n\n'Even if you think details may be insignificant, please come forward and speak to police.'\n\nOfficers are appealing for information and have urged people to get in touch by contacting police via the 24-hour 101 number, quoting URN 1761 19/10.\n\nYou can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'", "description": "A double murder investigation has been launched following the deaths of two teenage boys in Milton Keynes.
