Today OnePlus CEO Pete Lau tweeted an image of a box with a carbon fiber pattern and orange stripe. That pretty much says it all: the company has another McLaren Edition device on the way.\n\nThe company introduced the McLaren Edition with the 6T last year, and it was basically a 6T with maxed out specs and a black-and-orange design. There was one big new feature, however: super-fast 30 W charging.\n\nGiven the company already includes a 30W charger with the regular 7T now, the company will have to find some other way of differentiating itself from the lower-end configurations. One option is to go with even faster charging; OnePlus\u2019 parent company Oppo recently revealed 65W charging technology, and the two brands tend to share components.\n\nFor reference, the 30W charger is able to fill the 7T from 0 to 70 percent in an already ridiculously fast 30 minutes. That\u2019s already much faster than almost any other charging technology. Moreover, it maintains those speeds even while you\u2019re using your phone intensely, whereas other systems can slow down dramatically if the phone isn\u2019t on standby mode.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible the McLaren edition will only be a cosmetic change this time around, though that would be a little disappointing given the fanfare behind last year\u2019s model.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the McLaren Edition will come to the US, as the 7T Pro isn\u2019t available stateside, but it could be a compelling option in other markets. The company is hosting an event in London this week, so it probably won\u2019t be long until we find out more.\n\nRead next: Wendy's (yes, Wendy's) released a tabletop RPG", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FMcLaren-OP.jpg&signature=e707b5de5f749bf4df02526c4abd8f88", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
