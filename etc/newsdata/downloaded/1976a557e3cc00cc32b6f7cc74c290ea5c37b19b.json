Unless he reconsiders his goals for these negotiations, he\u2019s going to make a serious mistake.\n\nAfter abrogating the nuclear deal that his predecessor signed with Iran in 2015, Trump has stated his basic conditions for a new one: \u201cno nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles and a longer period of time.\u201d That last phrase is the problem. It refers to the \u201csunset provisions\u201d included in the previous agreement that defined exactly when some of its key terms would expire, thus allowing Iran to resume enriching uranium to high levels.\n\nAlmost as soon as the deal was signed, critics warned that these provisions would only defer Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons until 2030, when they were set to expire. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration contended that, even if Iran were so inclined, it would take a year \u2014 what nuclear scientists call \u201cbreakout time\u201d \u2014 to make a bomb. This, the Obama team thought, would be time enough for the world to pressure leaders in Tehran to desist.\n\nThat timeline was hopelessly optimistic, as events have since shown. It has taken Iran mere weeks this summer to blow past the agreed-to limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium. It is now threatening to deploy more advanced centrifuges, greatly shrinking the time required to reach weapons-grade.\n\nNor is there any doubt that Iran wants nuclear weapons. Abundant in oil and gas, it has no other rational reason for a nuclear program. A previous covert effort to make such weapons ended only when the regime was caught red-handed operating a secret uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz and a heavy-water facility in Arak.\n\nPerhaps the biggest drawback of the sunset provisions was that they were shortsighted. By the time they kicked in, Iran would\u2019ve had 15 years to collect hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenue, build up its military strength, and boost its support for proxies like Hezbollah. The regime would be in a far stronger position to resist international sanctions, and a future American president would find it far harder to rally support, at home or abroad, for a punitive military operation.\n\nIran would also be more deeply integrated into the world economy, greatly raising the cost to all nations of trying to rein it in. It\u2019s hard to imagine Europe \u2014 by then used to selling Iran billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Airbus passenger jets, Mirage fighters and Mercedes sedans \u2014 going along with any renewed sanctions, let alone a military campaign.\n\nIt was for these reasons that Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, characterized the 2015 deal as \u201ckicking the can down the road again for someone in the future to have to deal with.\u201d Kicking it a little further, as Trump now proposes, would not make the deal stronger; it would give Iran still more time to build up a war chest and yet more leeway to make a breakout for nuclear weapons.\n\nIn contrast, Iran right now is the weakest it has been in decades, and manifestly wilting under Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign. Rather than push for an extended sunset, Trump should hold out for a complete termination of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities and an end to its other threatening behavior \u2014 such as its ballistic-missile program and its support for terrorist groups across the Middle East \u2014 in exchange for readmission into the world economy.\n\nThis chance may never come again.\n\n--Editors: Bobby Ghosh, Timothy Lavin.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- President Donald Trump seems to be setting the stage for renewed talks with Iran over its nuclear program, raising the prospect of easing U.S. sanctions in exchange for a meeting with the Iranian president.
