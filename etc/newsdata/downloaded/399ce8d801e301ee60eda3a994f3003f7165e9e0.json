The details are fueling objections by Democratic lawmakers that the administration stonewalled them for weeks about the phone call and took extraordinary measures to suppress it from becoming public.\n\nThe intelligence official initially filed a complaint about Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings with the CIA, which then alerted the White House and the Justice Department. On Aug. 12, the official raised a separate flag, this time with the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, a process that granted the individual more legal \u201cwhistleblower\u201d protection.\n\nAt that time, the complaint filed with the inspector general, the report that was the focus of House hearings this week, remained private.\n\nBut information about the whistleblower was already making its way through the administration. On Aug. 14, A White House lawyer, John Eisenberg, and a CIA official alerted the head of the Justice Department\u2019s national-security division about the original complaint to the CIA.\n\nJohn Demers, who has led the national-security division for the past year and a half and was a senior official at the department during the George W. Bush administration, went to the White House the next day to review materials associated with the call.\n\nIn the following weeks, Demers had discussions with other Justice Department officials about how to handle the CIA complaint, according to the person familiar with the matter. It was during that period that the Justice Department also received a notification from the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general about the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe timeline raises questions about how the White House and the Justice Department handled that second complaint. The administration initially blocked Congress from viewing it, and only released a redacted version of the report to lawmakers this week after the House impeachment inquiry had begun.\n\nThe Justice Department said Attorney General William Barr was first notified of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call in late August, weeks after it happened, when the department learned that the inspector general believed the conversation could have amounted to a federal campaign finance crime.\n\nSee: Trump pressed Australian leader to help Barr probe Mueller inquiry: report\n\nThe attorney general himself is referenced repeatedly in the call. The president presses Ukraine\u2019s leader to work with Barr and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate corruption accusations, repeated with no evidence, against Democratic rival Joe Biden. The Justice Department has said Trump has never discussed the matter with Barr, or asked Barr to speak with Ukraine\u2019s president about it.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors reviewed a rough transcript of the Trump-Ukraine call \u2014 the official record kept by the White House \u2014 and determined that no crime was committed.\n\nAlso: Secretary of State Pompeo listened in on Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky\n\nThe House intelligence committee released the whistleblower\u2019s complaint on Thursday. The nine-page letter details a July 25 phone call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskiy and also alleges that the White House sought to \u201clock down\u201d details of the call by moving it onto a secure, classified computer system.\n\nThe complaint also details extensive interactions between Giuliani and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe person familiar with the matter, as well as another person with knowledge of the case, confirmed that the whistleblower was a CIA officer.\n\nThe Associated Press is publishing information about the whistleblower\u2019s background because the person\u2019s credibility is central to the impeachment inquiry into the president. The New York Times first reported that the individual was a CIA officer.\n\nA U.S. official and the two people familiar with the matter spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nOne of the whistleblower\u2019s attorneys, Mark Zaid, said publishing details about the individual places the person in a dangerous situation, personally and professionally. The CIA referred questions to the inspector general.\n\nRead on: Republican lawmaker from Illinois denounces Trump\u2019s tweet predicting \u2018civil war\u2019 if he\u2019s impeached", "description": "The White House and the Justice Department learned about a CIA officer\u2019s concerns about President Donald Trump around the same time the individual filed a...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS351_whistl_ZG_20190930170933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
