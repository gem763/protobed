This was the sixth fatal shooting by a Fort Worth police officer in the space of just four-and-a-half-months, sparking renewed outrage and calls for police accountability.\n\nDean was arrested on Monday evening, hours after he resigned from the police force. He was charged with murder and detained in Tarrant County jail but was released on Monday night after posting $200,000 bail.\n\nThere was growing anger in the community on Monday after bodycam footage was released showing Dean shooting Jefferson through her bedroom window without warning.\n\n\u201cNobody looked at that video and said there was any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,\u201d interim Fort Worth police chief, Ed Kraus, said during a press conference Monday.\n\nThe shooting drew comparisons to the case of Botham Jean, who was shot dead in his own apartment in Dallas by off-duty police officer Amber Guyger last year. Two weeks ago, Guyger was sentenced to 10-years in jail.\n\nREAD: \"Not racist but ...\": ex-Dallas cop Amber Guyger sent sketchy texts months before murdering unarmed Black man\n\nThe rapid arrest and murder charge are unusual in a police shooting like this, but representatives of Jefferson\u2019s family say this is just the first step.\n\n\u201cA murder charge and an arrest is a good start \u2014 it\u2019s more than we are used to seeing,\u201d S. Lee Merritt, a civil rights lawyer told the New York Times on Monday night. \u201cFort Worth has a culture that has allowed this to happen. There still needs to be a reckoning.\u201d\n\nAt 2.23 a.m. a neighbor of Jefferson\u2019s on the 1200 block of East Allen Avenue in Fort Worth called the police non-emergency line saying he was worried about a front and side door that had been left open in Jefferson\u2019s house for several hours.\n\nInside, according to a lawyer acting on behalf of Jefferson\u2019s family, the 28-year-old was playing Call of Duty with her 8-year-old nephew.\n\nDean and another officer responded to the call and bodycam footage shows the pair checking the perimeter using flashlights.\n\nREAD: Witness in Amber Guyger trial was killed in a drug deal gone wrong, cops say\n\nWhile the officers checked out the back of the house, Jefferson heard a noise, got up and went to her bedroom at the back of the house. She looked out the window to see what was happening.\n\nDean saw a figure through the dark window before quickly twisting his body to the left, drawing his gun and shouting through the window: \u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d\n\nDean then fires a single shot through the window, killing Jefferson.\n\nKraus said on Monday that he had planned on firing Dean. However, the former officer tendered his resignation in a one-sentence letter that read: \u201cEffective immediately I am tendering my resignation from the Fort Worth Police Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad the officer not resigned, I would have fired him for violations of several policies, including the use of deadly force, failure to de-escalate and unprofessional conduct,\u201d Kraus said on Monday.\n\nDean, who only became a police officer in April 2018 after graduating from the police academy a month earlier, will be recorded as having a dishonorable discharge.\n\nKraus said Dean was not cooperating with the investigation and had not answered questions from the investigators.\n\nJefferson had recently moved back to Fort Worth to take care of her mother and was selling medical equipment from her home as she studied to enter medical school.\n\nThe 28-year-old was simply enjoying life in her home \u201cwhere no one would have expected her life to be in harm\u2019s way, especially not at the hands of a civil servant who had taken the oath to serve and protect,\" Amber Carr, Jefferson\u2019s sister, said at a news conference Monday.\n\nThe family is calling for a federal investigation to be conducted into Fort Worth\u2019s police department, citing the department\u2019s recent record of officer-involved shootings. Kraus said the FBI has been briefed to investigate possible civil rights violations but had not yet indicated whether it would be investigating the case.\n\nThe news of Dean\u2019s arrest on Monday evening was greeted with muted cheers by a small group of neighbors who remained outside Jefferson\u2019s home, the New York Times reported.\n\nIn the wake of this shooting, anger has grown in Fort Worth\u2019s black community, which feels targeted by the police department. Hundreds of people turned out for a vigil on Sunday night at Jefferson\u2019s home, calling for action to be taken.\n\n\u201cI want to go ahead and dispel the myth that this is somehow a one-off \u2014 that this was just a bad-luck incident from an otherwise sound department,\u201d Merritt told the Dallas News. \u201cThe Fort Worth Police Department is on pace to be one of the deadliest police departments in the United States.\u201d\n\nCover: Bouquets of flowers and stuffed animals are piling up outside the Fort Worth home Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, where a 28-year-old black woman was shot to death by a white police officer.
