Tim Ryan on Thursday announced that he is ending his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nHe said he\u2019s proud of his campaign for giving a voice to \u201cforgotten\u201d people in the country and that he plans to run for re-election to his House seat next year.\n\n\u201cWhile it didn\u2019t work out quite the way we planned, this voice will not be stifled,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Ohio Democrat, said in a videotaped statement. \u201cI will continue to advocate and fight for the working people of this country.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan qualified for the first two Democratic debates, but he wasn\u2019t registering in recent polls.\n\nHe raised about $426,000 in the most recent fundraising quarter and started October with slightly more than $158,000 on hand - well back of the top-tier contenders.\n\nHe had pitched himself as a candidate in the more moderate lane among the 2020 Democratic field, warning that the expansive health care vision of candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernard Sanders would be too big of a shock to the system.\n\nBut that space has also been occupied by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who have seen an uptick in support in recent polls.\n\nOther Democratic candidates who have dropped out of the race include Rep. Eric Swalwell, former Sen. Mike Gravel, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Seth Moulton, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
