My conditioning from the bedrock of Chicago\u2019s south side was to avoid \u201cbeing soft,\u201d displaying emotion and expression.\n\n\n\nWhen I think of them now, the destructive ideas about Blackness and masculinity that infiltrated my mind were no more than a fallacy: Don\u2019t be too joyful, watch how much you smile, watch how you dress, display strength at all times, don\u2019t show too much emotion, disarm everyone around you, don\u2019t be too aggressive and definitely don\u2019t seem too happy. These are just a few tainted lessons Black men are often taught.\n\nBut I\u2019m a proud Black boy with joy, in line with the popular social media movement that embodies positive representation within Black male culture. #Blackboyjoy is a movement of fearlessness and fun, showcasing proud young Black men celebrating a variety of unexpected accomplishments. From fresh new hair do's, fishing, performing theater, wearing gender-neutral clothing and expressing their love of animals and nature. There is an immense pleasure in seeing us represented in a variety of ways outside of the stereotypical norm. Not only am I adherent to \u201cBlack Boy Joy,\u201d I\u2019ve graduated to the sentiments of being \u201cBlack Boy Fly.\u201d\n\nMy friend Joshua Renfroe wanted to capture this movement and his new photo book, Black Boy Fly is a creative showcase of immense identity and power. It displays Black men being represented in a multi-faceted, melanin filled rainbow, and I\u2019m honored to have co-produced this book with him.\n\n\u201cTo Black men specifically, don\u2019t forget you have exceeded expectations,\u201d Renfroe told me recently. \u201cYou have been brought into a system that is not built for you to succeed. But this is for us. This is to be a little cocky. This is for all of us to take pride in who we are. This book is a celebration.\u201d\n\nBlack Boy Fly, by Joshua Renfroe, and designed by Fred Sands IV, is available at Thecuratorynyc.com.\n\nStylists: Donnell Baldwin, Sydnee Paige, Raeana Anaiis and Erica Boisaubin.\n\nProducers: TJ Ali Bowden and Adam LaPalio", "description": "Joshua Renfroe's new photo book, 'Black Boy Fly,' showcases the nuance, love, and joy that we should celebrate more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db200df6e6538008d35ea73/lede/1572015382364-BBF_02.png?crop=1xw:0.8406976744186047xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
