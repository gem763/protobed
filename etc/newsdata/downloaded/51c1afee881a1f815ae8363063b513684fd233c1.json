The packages will be lowered down and released in customers\u2019 yards.\n\nWalgreens will sell more than 100 products, from gummy bears to Tylenol. Blacksburg-area retailer Sugar Magnolia will sell ice cream and birthday cards.\n\nWing initially will not charge for deliveries, which it said will occur in a limited but expanding area and sometimes arrive in five to 10 minutes. Other cities will follow, but the company would not say when or where.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re most excited about is the engagement with the local community and really hearing from community members of all types at all levels what it will really take to make this valuable and acceptable and an everyday part of our future existence,\u201d said Wing chief executive James Ryan Burgess.\n\nThe announcement comes as companies from UPS to Uber are pushing to launch similar services, and as other firms continue airborne deliveries involving medical goods and other products as part of a federal pilot program launched with White House backing.\n\nFederal officials and companies backing those projects tout their potential to bring newfound convenience to customers and transform tasks as diverse as fertilizer application and pipeline inspection.\n\nBut questions on noise, privacy and security remain.\n\nWing acknowledged in a statement that its drones \u201cmake a unique sound that people are unlikely to be familiar with.\u201d The company said it is working to develop \u201cnew, quieter and lower-pitched propellers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe aircraft are actually not too loud. They\u2019re quieter than cars and trucks and typical noises you\u2019d hear in a residential area, given equipment or other things operating,\u201d Burgess said. He added that Wing\u2019s engineers have been able to \u201creduce the tone and frequency of the aircraft to make them much more able to blend into the noise in a neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAddressing privacy concerns, the company said that its drones have a downward-facing camera \u201cused exclusively for navigation,\u201d in case the GPS signal drops out, and that they do not capture video. The images are processed on board and are \u201conly available to a small group of engineers for the purpose of analyzing safety and performance criteria,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very low resolution, and black and white in fact, so you\u2019re unable to recognize any people or features of specificity on the ground,\u201d Burgess said. He said Wing has practices in place \u201cto make sure that any data or log images or other things are not accessible and that we audit the access to those to ensure privacy for all involved.\u201d\n\nNational security officials are concerned that drones can be hacked or used to carry explosives in the United States, as has happened overseas. The Federal Aviation Administration has called for an identification and tracking system to manage the more than 1.3 million drones registered in the United States, but no comprehensive system is in place.\n\nBurgess said Wing has \u201csystems to ensure that interception and any other sort of bad acting can\u2019t create harm in our system.\u201d\n\nStadium and team owners see drones as major threat\n\nIn April, Wing was the first drone company certified by the FAA as an \u201cair carrier,\u201d a designation that had been reserved for commercial operations such as charter flights with human pilots.\n\nThat regulatory breakthrough smoothed a major impediment for Wing \u2014 under FAA drone regulations, companies cannot charge to carry packages for other companies beyond where the drone\u2019s operator can see, Wing said. But as an \u201cair carrier,\u201d Wing can perform those fundamentals. At least a half-dozen drone delivery companies have applied or have said they will apply for such \u201cair carrier\u201d status.\n\nThe FAA said it considered \u201cextensive data,\u201d including thousands of successful Wing flights in Australia, in concluding that the company could operate safely in the United States. They can fly only during the day and out of the rain. The drones can transit over people but cannot hover above them and cannot carry hazardous materials.\n\nDrone company Wing gets \u2018air carrier\u2019 approval from FAA\n\nVirginia officials have rolled out the drone welcome mat, helping Wing dodge, so far, broad-based opposition to its operations. The trial will start in \u201ca few initial areas in Christiansburg,\u201d population 22,500, Burgess said. It has no set end date, he said.\n\nSome communities elsewhere in the country have sought to ban drones over their neighborhoods. But such local actions have raised unresolved questions about local and federal power. The FAA has pointed to its far-reaching authority to regulate U.S. skies. The federal pilot program has paired eager state and local officials with companies looking for real-world experience and markets.\n\nIt is not clear how things might evolve in communities that prefer to forgo the promised boost in convenience to keep their skies drone-free.", "description": "Customers and neighbors will gauge the value of newfound convenience vs. drone-free skies.", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I7SQG7W27EI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
