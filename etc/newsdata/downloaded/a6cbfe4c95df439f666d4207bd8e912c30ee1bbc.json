I bought it from a bookseller on the streets of Addis Ababa.\n\nThe book that changed my life\n\nEvery book I read changes me in one way or another. Something is created in me through reading and so I am changed. That\u2019s the beauty of reading, isn\u2019t it? There was no Catcher in the Rye or Fire Next Time moment. But then I didn\u2019t go to university. It\u2019s a different journey through books for me.\n\nThe book I wish I\u2019d written\n\nBinti, a science fiction novella by Nnedi Okorafor. There is an exciting movement in African science fiction happening right now and Binti is the gateway drug. Okorafor\u2019s imagination is limitless.\n\nThe book that had the greatest influence on me\n\nI read Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White while locked in Wood End Assessment Centre in Wigan and realised that I was catching fire myself.\n\nThe book I give as a gift\n\nAida Edemariam\u2019s The Wife\u2019s Tale. It is subversive, brilliantly researched and committed.\n\nThe book that is most underrated\n\nMoon Tiger by Penelope Lively won the Booker prize in the 1980s. Can a book be a winner and also be underrated? Prejudice knows no bounds.\n\nThe book that changed my mind\n\nThe autobiography of Malcolm X taught me that a real hero chooses the road less travelled: popularity is no measure of integrity.\n\nThe last book that made me cry and laugh\n\nBantam by Jackie Kay. Her poetic salutation to her family and to Scotland moves me every time.\n\nThe book I\u2019d most like to be remembered for\n\nI\u2019d like to be remembered for the Odyssey but that was written by Homer so no chance of that. As for my books, my memoir My Name Is Why. It is the truth of what happened.\n\nMy earliest reading memory\n\nSitting at a table at infant school with my finger on a drawing in a Ladybird book. Ladybirds provided the building blocks of the written word. And from these structures the world opened. The whole world was filled with words waiting for me.\n\nMy comfort read\n\nA Life in Thirty-Five Boxes: How I Survived Selling My Record Collection by Dave Haslam. He\u2019s from my time in Manchester and was a DJ at the Hacienda. Once you have discovered him there is no going back.\n\nMy guilty pleasure\n\nLee Child\u2019s Jack Reacher series. But no more films, OK?\n\n\u2022 My Name Is Why by Lemn Sissay is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.
