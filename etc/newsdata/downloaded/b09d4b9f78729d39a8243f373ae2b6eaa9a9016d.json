CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Facebook says removed multiple accounts from Indonesia, UAE, Nigeria, and Egypt\n\n(Corrects spelling of Agranovich, changes paragraph 11 to refer\n\nto pages not accounts)\n\nOct 4 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc has announced it\n\nremoved hundreds of pages, groups and accounts on its platforms\n\nfor \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" linked to three\n\noperations in Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and\n\nNigeria.\n\nThe operation in Indonesia involved a network of over 100\n\nfake accounts on Facebook and Instagram posting content in\n\nEnglish and Indonesian either in support or criticizing the West\n\nPapua independence movement, which is active in the country's\n\nrestive easternmost region of Papua.\n\n\"This was a network of pages designed to appear like local\n\nmedia organizations and advocacy organizations,\" said David\n\nAgranovich, Facebook's Global Lead for Threat Disruption.\n\nHe told Reuters that his team, which had been monitoring\n\nIndonesia in light of increasing tensions in Papua, had tracked\n\nthe false accounts, which would disseminate content, buy ads,\n\nand drive people to other sites, to an Indonesian media firm\n\ncalled InsightID.\n\nReuters was not immediately able to reach the firm for\n\ncomment.\n\nThere has been a spike in protests and unrest since late\n\nAugust in Papua, which suffered some of its worst bloodshed in\n\ndecades in September, with 33 people killed and scores\n\ninjured. L3N26O2GS\n\nResearchers had independently warned in September that there\n\nhad been a rise of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts on Papua,\n\nwith some of the fake accounts posting pro-government content.\n\nAgranovich said Facebook also removed fake accounts related\n\nto two other unconnected networks in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nOne, according to Facebook, was based out of Egypt, but\n\ntargeted the rest of the region by posting content in support of\n\nthe United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, as well as\n\ncriticism of Qatar, Iran, Turkey and Yemen's separatist\n\nmovement.\n\nThe executive said this operation used fake accounts \"to\n\nmasquerade as local media organizations in a variety of those\n\ncountries ... and amplify the content they were posting.\"\n\nAccording to Agranovich, Facebook found evidence some of the\n\npages had been purchased, with regular changing ownerships, as\n\nwell as deep links to Egyptian newspaper El Fagr, \"which is\n\nknown for its sensationalistic content.\"\n\nAs a result of the investigation, Facebook has also removed\n\nEl Fagr's official media pages from its platforms, he said.\n\nReuters was not able to immediately contact El Fagr.\n\nFacebook said the third network, which it tracked to three\n\nmarketing firms in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Nigeria,\n\ninvolved fake accounts which spread on content on topics like\n\nUAE's activity in Yemen and the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThe social media giant has recently been cracking down on\n\nsuch accounts after coming under fire in the last few years for\n\nits self-admitted sluggishness in developing tools to combat\n\nextremist content and propaganda operations.\n\nEarlier this year, it removed accounts from Iraq, Ukraine,\n\nChina, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Thailand, Honduras and\n\nIsrael.\n\n\n\n", "description": "CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Facebook says removed multiple accounts from Indonesia, UAE, Nigeria, and Egypt", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPED8K13A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
