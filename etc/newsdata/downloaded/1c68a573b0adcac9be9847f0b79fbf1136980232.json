The new phone includes a chip referred to as \"U1\", and which it says is used for sensing things in space.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.\n\nBut it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too. What is less clear is what exactly those features are.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more \"precise\".\n\n\"The new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness \u2013 allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices,\" it reads. \"It's like adding another sense to iPhone, and it's going to lead to amazing new capabilities.\"\n\nApple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices \u2013 telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.\n\nThe chip could also presumably help with Apple's plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.\n\nThe chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.", "description": "Apple's newest iPhone has a mysterious \"U1\" chip inside of it \u2013 and nobody is really clear what it does.
