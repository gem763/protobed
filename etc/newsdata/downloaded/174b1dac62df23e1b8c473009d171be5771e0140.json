Five said the bank would cut by 100 bps, three predicted a 150 bps cut and three 50 bps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, but broadly in line with expectations,\u201d said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Egypt-based Naeem Brokerage, which predicted a 150 bps cut.\n\n\u201cWe expect the monetary easing cycle to continue as inflation is likely to drop further before the MPC meets again in November,\u201d Sandeep said.\n\nThe central bank cut rates after inflation figures fell to their lowest in more than six years, it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGlobally, the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and trade tensions continued to weigh on the outlook,\u201d the bank said. \u201cInternational oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risks.\u201d\n\nJuly inflation came in significantly below expectations, and the headline figure fell further in August to a six-year low of 7.5%. Headline inflation reached a 2019 high of 14.4% in February.\n\nAt its last policy meeting in August, the central bank slashed its overnight deposit and lending rates by 150 basis points to 14.25% and 15.25% respectively.\n\nThe low July inflation figures took analysts by surprise as they had expected inflationary pressures to rise in the wake of a round of subsidy cuts that pushed fuel prices 16-30% higher.\n\nThe fuel price hikes were the last in a series of subsidy cuts tied to a three-year $12 billion loan from the IMF. Other reforms tied to the deal included devaluing the currency by about half and introducing a value-added tax.\n\nThe reforms have made Egypt an emerging market darling, and economists have hailed the measures. But millions of Egyptians are still struggling to make ends meet, despite the more positive economic data.\n\n\u201cIt could have been more but I\u2019m glad the MPC cut the rates. It is a good move,\u201d said Angus Blair, chairman of business and economic forecasting think-tank Signet.\n\n\u201cIt will not affect the economy too much as Egypt\u2019s household and corporate sectors are not too leveraged,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will, however, help to bring down the government\u2019s debt burden and give it greater fiscal maneuverability.\u201d\n\nThe bank\u2019s decision to make a second consecutive cut came after Egypt\u2019s main stock index suffered heavy losses between Sunday and Tuesday following rare weekend protests against alleged government corruption.\n\nThe benchmark EGX30 .EGX30 index rebounded, gaining 3.2% on Wednesday and 1.9% on Thursday.", "description": "Egypt's central bank on Thursday cut its key interest rates for the second month in a row, after inflation fell further and as central banks globally ease monetary policy.", "authors": ["Yousef Saba", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
