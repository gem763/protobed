Snowballing into a sustained outburst of anti-government and anti-China fury, the youth-led protests have plunged the international hub for trade and finance into its deepest crisis since the territory reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d said Kevin Cui, a tourist from mainland China who\u2019d planned to visit Disneyland only to discover at a shuttered subway station in central Hong Kong that the network was suspended. \u201cThis is very troublesome.\u201d\n\nA message on the MTR website cited staff safety and the need for repairs among reasons for the closure.\n\nAfter widespread arson attacks, looting, fighting with police and beatings, the government appealed for a public shift in attitude against rioting.\n\nJohn Lee, the government\u2019s security secretary, said by not condemning violence, people are stoking it.\n\n\u201cWhat is adding oil to violence is people\u2019s support for these acts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is important is that everybody comes out to say, \u2018No, society will not accept violence.'\u201d\n\nBut even many peaceful protesters say violence has become a means to an end, the only way for young masked protesters to force the government to bend.\n\nAs a group of black-clad youths in protective gear rushed past him, many carrying bamboo sticks, a property industry worker who came out with his wife Friday night to show his opposition to the mask ban expressed his admiration for those confronting police.\n\n\u201cI know they have done terrible things\u201d he said. \u201cCan you believe how brave they are?\u201d\n\nHe gave only his first name, Alex. He and his wife, Pauline, both donned masks that covered their mouths to hit streets in central Hong Kong where clouds of police tear gas to disperse protesters also caused spluttering tourists and Friday night revelers to flee, eyes stinging.\n\nLam insisted when announcing the ban Friday that the measure and her use of rarely deployed emergency powers to introduce it without legislative approval were not steps toward authoritarian rule or at the behest of the Chinese government. Two activists filed legal challenges late Friday on grounds it would instill fear and curtail freedom of assembly, but a court denied their request for an injunction.\n\nInternational observers worried that Lam\u2019s resort to the Emergency Ordinance that had lain dormant since last used to quell riots in 1967 could be a harbinger of harsher measures in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory deeply attached to its special freedoms and fearful of becoming a tightly controlled city like all the others in China.\n\nFirst indications were that rather than soothe tensions, the measure inflamed them.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, masked protesters rampaged, setting fires, setting up makeshift road blocks that backed up traffic and vandalizing subway stations, China-linked business and other property.\n\nAn officer fired a single shot from his gun in self-defense after he was attacked by protesters in the northern Yuen Long district, said police spokeswoman Yolanda Yu. She said a man was wounded, but police didn\u2019t know exactly how he got shot. A police official, who requested anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak to the news media, said the victim is 14. A Hospital Authority spokesman said the teen was in serious but not critical condition.\n\nThe teen became the second victim of gunfire in the protests that began in June. An 18-year-old protester was also shot at close range by a riot police officer on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Eileen Ng and Katie Tam contributed to this report.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 All subway and train services were suspended, lines formed at the cash machines of shuttered banks, and shops were closed as Hong Kong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/05/d083e3_hong-kong-protests-17981-masked-protesters-walk-banner-reads-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
