He then mutters: \"Racist.\"\n\nOscar posted the footage to social media with the caption: \"Been bumped to bits.\"\n\nThe device in question is a simple human voice-activated fingerprint-proof bin, which is sold for \u00a3230.\n\nThe bin opens automatically in response to the phrase \"open can\".\n\n(Image: Oscar Symington/Deadline News)\n\nOscar says to the camera: \"Right, so me mam and dad just bought a bin for the house and it's supposed to be voice activated.\"\n\nHe begins in his normal accent, repeating the phrase: \"Open can.\"\n\nThe lid remains firmly shut. Oscar tries again and gets no response. Oscar changes tactic and adds: \"But if you do it in an American accent.\"\n\nHe then drawls \"Open can\" and the lid pings open immediately.\n\nOscar groans before grumbling: \"Racist.\"\n\n(Image: Deadline News)\n\nOscar said: \"I just came home to it. I thought it was broken when I was talking to it.\n\n\"It was a good couple minutes I had to try with posh accents, but it still wasn't working.\n\n\"I've not got a clue what made me think of it, but thought because I'm Geordie, I thought it might just be the accent. I don't think I've got that much of an accent though.\"\n\nAccording to The Life Science Centre museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, 79 per cent of AI users claim to drop their regional accent in order to be understood by their virtual assistants.\n\nIn 2011, hundreds of Scots reported that their iPhone struggled to understand them when Apple first launched its Siri app.\n\n(Image: Deadline News)\n\n\n\nSimilar complaints have come from Irish AI users, with Donegal natives having the most difficulty being understood according to research from Pure Telecom.\n\nThe video was a huge hit online. Natalie Stanger commented: \"Cannot stop laughing.\"\n\nScott Hall added: \"Hahahah class\".\n\nWilliam F Dame said: \"That's awesome.\"\n\nAnd Gareth Sewell joked: \"What language were you originally talking in?\"", "description": "Newcastle barber Oscar Symington, 18, says the pricey gadget ignores his commands in hilarious video", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Oscar Symington Deadline News", "Deadline News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743605.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PAY-Oscar-Symington.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
