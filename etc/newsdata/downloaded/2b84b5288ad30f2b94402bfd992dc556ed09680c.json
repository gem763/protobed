I believe I could have just been more Serena today. I honestly don\u2019t think Serena showed up. I have to kind of figure out how to get her to show up in Grand Slam finals.\u201d\n\nHer tone was doleful, but there is no reason for her to hold her head in shame.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that she is 37, and deserves credit simply for still being at the highest reaches of the game at that age, doing battle against opponents who are still in their teens. Or that she is the mother of a daughter, Olympia, she clearly adores. Williams didn\u2019t win this title, but it was once again evident as these past two weeks swept by that all of tennis, and this tournament in particular, remains beholden to her powerful sway.\n\nWalk the grounds at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center and you could feel it in the way fans lined up on the practice courts to see her warm up.

The girl sprinted off to get a closer look, a pony tail bobbing against her back.\n\n\u201cSerena!\u201d One word. All that was needed. Her popularity and influence \u2014 the way it is impossible to look away when her image flashes across a screen, the way she matters in realms far beyond the court \u2014 is of course an impact that few in sports have ever known.", "description": "She was plowing through the U.S. Open toward what seemed like a fitting victory.
