Kim\u2019s character in an upcoming TV show is adopted from her character in previous drama series \u201cDiary of a Rural Village\u201d (1980-2002), top. In the drama, Kim played a foul-mouthed yet warm-hearted mother. Kim also appears in the musical \u201cMy Mother,\u201d above. [SBS PLUS , JOONGANG ILBO, SHOW 21]\n\nActress Kim Soo-mi turned 70 last month, but she is living proof that you can be in the limelight at any age.With two TV shows - \u201cMom\u2019s Touch\u201d on tvN and \u201cBloody Life Class - The Best One-Shot\u201d on MBN - under her belt, the actress is now cooking and serving hearty bowls of gukbap, soup served with rice, to guests through the newly-launched TV show \u201cAre You Eating Well?\u201dThe septuagenarian also appears in the musical \u201cMy Mother\u201d four days a week. After receiving positive reviews, the musical recently announced that it will be staging the show in other cities outside Seoul until March, keeping the actress busier than ever before.In addition to that, Kim is scheduled to appear in the KBS2 drama series \u201cWoman of 9.9 Billion\u201d starting November. In the series, she will play a big wig in the loan shark business.Kim is also trying to reach broader audiences with her podcast \u201cSibang Counseling Center\u201d which is available through Naver Audio Clip. On the show, she provides solutions to those who have worries.It is no exaggeration to say that Kim is in the midst of another heyday.In fact, she is even more adored now than she was four decades ago when she began to make a name for herself playing the role of Il-yong\u2019s mother in the hit series \u201cDiary of a Rural Village\u201d (1980-2002).In the drama, which depicted the everyday lives of people living in rural Korea, Kim portrayed a foul-mouthed yet warm-hearted mother in her 70s. She was 31 when she started playing the character. Other actresses her age were not willing to play the role, but Kim didn\u2019t care.Thanks to the role, Kim became one of a few celebrities who have the freedom to say some harsh words because it was a part of her character.After playing the elderly woman in the \u201cDiary of a Rural Village\u201d for 22 years, Kim has appeared in projects of various genres, from sitcoms to gangster films to variety shows.The latest chapter in Kim\u2019s career seems to owe a lot to her natural-born cooking skills. Her ability to whip up humble ingredients into savory dishes has drawn praise from viewers of all ages.\u201cNo matter how tired I am, I find myself jumping up when I see ingredients for kimchi,\u201d said Kim during a recent interview with JoongAng Ilbo, the affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily.She was known to prepare daily meals for the entire cast and crew of \u201cDiary of a Rural Village,\u201d which is no surprise considering the fact that she used to host cooking shows on TV in the 80s and has even published some of her own cookbooks as well.Then and now, Kim makes all kinds of kimchi and side dishes using ripe ingredients depending on the season and gives them out to people around her. That is one of her regular routines.Having 14 refrigerators at home, all stuffed with kimchi, side dishes and condiments, Kim often invites her friends over to her house.At home, Kim uses an electric rice cooker that is capable of preparing 50 servings.\u201cWhen certain kimchi or gejang is ripe, I call people around me so that they could come and eat. Some even drop by with rollers in their hair. I can easily have up to 10 guests [with a few calls].\u201dGejang is a dish of raw crab marinated in soy sauce, and Kim is known for her expertise in the dish - so much so that she used to sell her own on home shopping TV channels.The actress says cooking runs in her blood. \u201cI think I was born with it.\u201dBorn in Gunsan, North Jeolla, Kim remembers eating at table so full of dishes that she \u201chad to stack the dishes\u201d in order to fit everything on the dining table. But when she moved from Gunsan to Seoul at the age of 13 to study, Kim found herself eating with only one side dish of pickled radish.When she was 18, Kim\u2019s mother passed away, and soon after she began reproducing her mother\u2019s dishes.\u201cI had a craving for my mom\u2019s fresh kimchi and marinated young hairtail fish when I was pregnant, but I couldn\u2019t eat them so I wept. Around that time, I began to give it a try and make the things my mom used to make for me.\u201dThe following are edited excerpts from the interview.I would say now is my third peak since I debuted in 1970. The first one came when I did the drama series \u201cDiary of a Rural Village\u201d and the second came along with some films such as \u201cMarrying the Mafia\u201d (2002) and \u201cMapado\u201d (2005). This time, it all started with cooking and I feel like this is the strongest one. Even all the ladies I have met at the sauna in my neighborhood come up and talk to me. I think one reason [behind the success] is that I have tried to keep it real and communicate with the viewers with all my heart.More and more people spend less time cooking at home. A lot of people also eat alone and merely stuff their stomach with food. But many people often say they work to eat when they are asked what they live for. I feel pity for them. Preparing food with care is a way to love yourself. And you can develop bonds when you share food. Things go smoothly when you eat together with someone. I wanted to inform young people about this culture.Grandpas who live by themselves do not eat nutritious meals. What if they get cancer one day?The mother I play in the musical resembles my own mother. She was so devoted to her children and she spent her whole life devoted to her children, too. The musical reminds me of my mother whenever I take the stage. It makes me cry every time.I make everything my daughter wants to eat. She and her family left for the Czech Republic two months ago for work. My husband will go there soon to meet them, so I\u2019m making all the side dishes my grandchildren love to eat such as sweet and salty black beans and seasoned dried squid. I tell my daughter, \u201cI\u2019m so jealous of you. You\u2019re so fortunate [to have a mother who cooks for you].\u201dI wake up at 5:30 every morning. I wake up, work out and go to the sauna every day. And then I start making side dishes for two hours at 7:30 a.m. I can make up to 50 portions in about two hours. After that, I go to the set. I tend not to make any appointments at night. I go to bed at 11 p.m. at the latest.My father once took me to my house in Seoul when I was a middle school student and he told me \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t roam around at night because you have big and beautiful eyes. If you are dragged to a brothel, you won\u2019t be able to see me forever.\u201d I was so freaked out that I have gone home when it starts to get dark ever since.I want to be remembered as a legend. There is a song called \u201cThe Leopard of Kilimanjaro\u201d and the lyrics go like this: \u201cI can\u2019t come like wind and go like dew. I have to leave the traces of me living here once.\u201d I tell myself, \u201cI can\u2019t go without doing anything.\u201d I want to be remembered as an actor as well as a [good] person. I hope I can hear people saying \u201cI was helped by Kim Soo-mi.\u201dBY LEE JI-YOUNG [estyle@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13202909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
