Herrera, the city attorney, penned a formal memo to officials on Sept. 23 stating no city \"department will take steps to restrict any contractor from doing business with the NRA or to restrict city contracting opportunities for any business that has any relationship with the NRA,\u201d according to an NRA press release from Monday.\n\nBreed told FOX Business in a statement Wednesday that the country is facing \"an epidemic of gun violence.\"\n\n\"[W]e need to hold organizations like the NRA accountable for their obstruction to real reforms to make our communities us safer,\" she said. \"While this non-binding resolution has no force of law behind it, this doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that the NRA continues to shamefully stand in the way of every single piece of gun control legislation that can and will save lives.\u201d\n\nThe mayor's office also provided FOX Business with a copy of the memo, which can be found below.\n\nOn Sept. 3, San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors approved a three-page resolution, making the \u201cterrorist organization\u201d declaration. The resolution also called for vendors to re-evaluate their relationships with the NRA and \u201climit those entities \u2026 from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization,\" according to documents published at the time by SFGate.com.\n\nThe resolution was authored by Supervisor Catherine Stefani after a late July shooting spree at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, held in the Bay area, that left four people dead and more than a dozen injured.\n\nThe NRA, in turn, filed suit on Sept. 9, accusing the city and county of San Francisco, along with 11 members of the board of supervisors, of violating its constitutional rights to free speech and free association as well as seeking to impose censorship. Unchecked, San Francisco's measure would have a \"chilling effect\" on the organization and its members, the NRA said.\n\n\u201cThe memo serves as a clear concession and a well-deserved win for the First and Second Amendments of the United States Constitution,\u201d one of the organization\u2019s attorneys, William A. Brewer III, said in a statement. \u201cIt is unfortunate that in today\u2019s polarized times, some elected officials would rather silence opposing arguments than engage in good-faith debate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBreed took to Twitter shortly after the NRA\u2019s announcement, to condemn the organization for releasing the information on the second anniversary of the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nJohn Cote, communications director for the San Francisco City Attorney's Office, insisted that the memo \"is not a concession.\"\n\n\"It just explains what has always been true \u2014 the resolution does not change the law,\" Cote told FOX Business. \"If the NRA thinks this is a win, it\u2019s only because their lawsuit completely distorts what the resolution actually does.\u201d", "description": "The NRA declared victory over San Francisco.
