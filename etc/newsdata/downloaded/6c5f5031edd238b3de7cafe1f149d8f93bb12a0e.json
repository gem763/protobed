(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nPresident Trump is threatening America\u2019s love affair with cheese. The trade war with China has already rattled Americans. Consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in nine months in September. The opening of an official impeachment inquiry by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday is doing little to calm nerves either.\n\nThose seeking out cheese platters or stringy delicious goodness on pizza to cope, may lose that comfort food, too.\n\nThe American cheese industry is bracing for costs from additional tariffs next month after the recent World Trade Organization ruling in favor of Trump\u2019s bid to impose tariffs on European products. The move is meant to offset subsidies to European aerospace giant Airbus which Boeing has referred to as illegal. \u201cThe EU has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade for many years. It will soon stop!\u201d Trump said in April.\n\nThe WTO will make its official ruling public next week, but has already authorized the U.S. to impose tariffs on nearly $8 billion of European products.\n\nThe US has proposed retaliatory tariffs on several European products including cheese, olive oil, and wine that could be as much as 100 percent. The tariffs are in response to the European Union's subsidies to European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.

The EU is likely to hit back with its own set of retaliatory tariffs.\n\nCheese has also landed in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s dispute with the European Union.\n\nThe top-selling cheeses that could be impacted include Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano Reggiano from Italy, French Brie, and Gouda from the Netherlands. The cost of doing business in the cheese industry would double should Trump choose to impose the additional 100% tariff. The added tariff would cost importers $1 billion annually, according to the Cheese Importers Association of America, a trade group.\n\n$40 per pound\n\nMost specialty cheese from Europe costs between $10 to $19 a pound. If U.S. importers couldn\u2019t afford to absorb the higher cost of tariffs, they might decide to pass them onto consumers. The Cheese Importers Association of America estimates that European cheese prices would increase to $20 to $40 per pound. Importers fear that consumers might balk at those prices.\n\nThe $1 billion of cheese imports the USTR is targeting for tariffs generates over $3.5 billion in revenue for U.S. businesses, like trucking companies, importers, supermarkets, and restaurants. Higher tariffs eat into margins and would result in the loss of over 20,000 jobs, according to the Cheese Importers Association of America.\n\nAirplane subsidies\n\nHow cheese and other food products like wine and olive oil became Trump targets continues to stump importers who say those food items have nothing to do with the airplane dispute Trump wants to punish Europe for.\n\n\u201cWhy bring in all these other types of products and everything else when it has nothing to do with the aerospace industry. If you have a problem with regard to agriculture and the United States wants more access to Europe, that\u2019s a separate issue.
