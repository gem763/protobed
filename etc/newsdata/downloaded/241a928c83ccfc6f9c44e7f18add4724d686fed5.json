NO ARCHIVE.\n\nIn a statement, the Supreme Court said a Caracas court with national jurisdiction had ordered Zambrano\u2019s \u201cimmediate freedom,\u201d but added that his case remains open. He would need to report to a judge every 30 days and would be barred from leaving the country, it said.\n\n\u201cI managed to escape from a situation that I hope all political prisoners manage to escape from,\u201d Zambrano told reporters after being released.\n\nVenezuela was plunged into a deep political crisis in January when Juan Guaido - the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly - invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing Maduro\u2019s May 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\n\nMaduro\u2019s government, which calls Guaido a U.S. puppet, has responded by opening various criminal probes into Guaido and stripping many of his lawmaker colleagues of their parliamentary immunity. Many have fled the country. Zambrano was dragged away in his car by a tow truck upon his arrest in May.\n\nNearly 800 people were arbitrarily detained in Venezuela as of May 31, according to a July report by Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\n\u201cThe liberation of Zambrano and political prisoners is a victory of citizen and international pressure, and the Bachelet report - not a \u2018kind gesture\u2019 from the dictatorship,\u201d Guaido said on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Maduro\u2019s ruling socialist party reached a deal with small opposition parties, including Timoteo Zambrano\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Change\u201d party, aimed at resolving the South American country\u2019s deep political divide.\n\nMonday\u2019s deal was not backed by the mainstream opposition parties who control the National Assembly, including Edgar Zambrano\u2019s Democratic Action and Guaido\u2019s Popular Will.\n\nAs part of the deal, the government said it would ask the justice system to evaluate alternatives to \u201cthe privation of liberty\u201d for some prisoners. It also said it would reform the National Electoral Commission, which the opposition accuses of bias in favor of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cThe process of freeing political prisoners has begun,\u201d Timoteo Zambrano wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe celebrate the freedom of our colleague, the deputy Edgar Zambrano.\u201d\n\nThe two men are not related.\n\nGuaido over the weekend declared a round of talks mediated by Norway\u2019s foreign ministry between his allies and the government dead, six weeks after Maduro walked away from the table in protest against U.S. sanctions.", "description": "Venezuelan authorities released opposition lawmaker Edgar Zambrano from custody on Tuesday, four months after his arrest on treason charges, a move his allies said was a result of popular pressure, not a sign of goodwill from President Nicolas Maduro.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431052910&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H05E", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
