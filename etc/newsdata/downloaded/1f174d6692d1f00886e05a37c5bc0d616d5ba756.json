He hadn\u2019t been on deck when the tourists visited Worcestershire after the successful First Test but he had a job here during this otherwise cruisy fixture. But it had nothing to do with either the shock of what had happened at Leeds, nor anything that related to that ongoing task. Rather, he spent the day taking meetings with senior players about next October\u2019s T20 World Cup.\n\nSuch is the existence of a full-time international coach. Cricket has never been a particularly good game for finish lines and with three formats to consider, not least when the person in charge is away from their own bed upwards of 300 nights per year. In this relentless world, teams do the best they can when it comes to planning. They squeeze it in when they can.\n\nIt is England who are now the gold standard for long-term vision, in limited-overs cricket, on the basis of their World Cup win. It was a trophy they had never won until this year, administrators immediately turning their attention to 2019 when they were bundled out in 2015. They were mindful, too, that the tournament was being played on home soil. It\u2019s much the same for Australia in 2020, hosting the short-form spectacular for the first time, the one white-ball trophy that they have failed to secure.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDue to the vagaries of how he assumed his current position following Darren Lehmann\u2019s abrupt resignation, Langer did not get the chance to do an awful lot about their World Cup tilt this year. Their thrashing in the semi-final to England stung, but on the basis of that relatively modest lead time \u2013 and dreadful form in 50-over cricket since 2015 - it was a conclusion they could accept and move on from. This was an Ashes summer, after all.\n\nThat Australia had not got the job done in England since 2001 in the traditional form of the game steered their focus too, Pat Howard, the former high-performance tsar, credited with putting a series of building blocks in place for this trip two years earlier. Both teams have been rewarded for their spadework, leaving this marathon season with the prizes that meant relatively more to them due to earlier failings.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trevor Bayliss is no longer England's head coach, departing at the end of the 2019 Ashes after a long summer in which he guided them to World Cup victory. But who could replace the Australian at the helm? Getty Images 2/10 Chris Silverwood England's pace bowling coach guided Essex to the County Championship title in 2017 and is a calming influence who appears to be well-liked by the playing group. He is set to take interim charge for the tour of New Zealand, which could function as an audition of sorts. If England want to keep things in house, Silverwood could fit. Getty Images 3/10 Jason Gillespie A leading contender when Bayliss was appointed, Gillespie is rated highly by the ECB, and the respected Australian has done solid work rebuilding Sussex after a successful previous stint with Yorkshire, where he forged a relationship with Test captain Joe Root. While he has spoken of his desire to stay on with Sussex and the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash, an offer may well be extended across the table to test his resolve. Bryn Lennon/Getty Images 4/10 Mickey Arthur If England favour an experienced international coach to keep things ticking over, Arthur may be their man. With spells in charge of his native South Africa, Australia and latterly Pakistan, Arthur might be a somewhat uninspiring choice, but he'd be a steady hand on the tiller. AFP/Getty Images 5/10 Mike Hesson Hesson shockingly stepped down from his job as New Zealand head coach less than 12 months before this summer's World Cup, and recently resigned his position as head coach of the Kings XI Punjab of the IPL to press for the Indian head coaching job. While he narrowly missed out to incumbent Ravi Shastri for that role, it was Hesson who - in tandem with Brendon McCullum - transformed New Zealand cricket after taking charge in 2012 and it was from his and McCullum's blueprint that England built their World Cup winning side. Hesson would be an intriguing choice. Getty Images 6/10 Ottis Gibson South Africa moved on from Gibson this summer after a disappointing World Cup, but he had done a good job with the Proteas, on the whole, guiding them through some tougher times. Well-liked from his two spells as England bowling coach (Stuart Broad has been particularly glowing in his praise of Gibson's guidance), the Barbadian is a solid option. AFP/Getty Images 7/10 Paul Collingwood The vacancy may come a couple of years too soon for Collingwood, but the fact that the steely all-rounder has been injected into the England environment so soon after his playing retirement suggests he is some one the top ECB brass have their eye on. He possesses a strong tactical mind, particularly in white-ball cricket. AFP/Getty Images 8/10 Paul Farbrace Farbrace's departure to Warwickshire ahead of the 2019 summer came as a surprise, for it seemed Bayliss' affable assistant could have been in line for a promotion. He was influential in England's ODI turnaround, and while he now seems an outside bet having not long left the group, he would provide a degree of continuity. Getty Images 9/10 Alec Stewart Stewart appears to be happy at Surrey, but you could not ask for a sager head to guide England onwards. He has overseen a revolution at The Oval, cultivating and nurturing young talent and has considerable cricketing nous, and Stewart's knowledge of the county game would be an asset. Getty Images 10/10 Split coaches? ECB Director of Cricket Ashley Giles could opt to split the role, appointing two coaches - one for white-ball cricket and one for Test matches. Though the practicality of a split arrangement is a little uncertain, it would lessen the intensity of a role that has become extremely demanding. Giles has suggested such a move is unlikely, but it remains an option. Getty Images 1/10 Who could replace Trevor Bayliss?

Yes, winning the T20 title at the MCG in front of 100,000 people would be a considerable achievement for Australian cricket. But if that comes at the expense of a still-fragile Test team, as it so palpably did this year for England, then will it be worth it? Cue the spinning plates of a tricky home season ahead, starting barely moments after the players disembark with the start of the domestic 50-over competition.\n\nAs Langer explained in his post-Ashes debrief, he knows the short-form focus is integral. Equally, he sees the bigger picture about the team-at-large having to grow as senior players so to even out volatility in their performances. \u201cThat probably comes with the maturity of the group,\u201d he explained. \u201cTo fight back from a tough loss is admirable but also over the last couple of years, we haven\u2019t necessarily performed at our best after a win. Really good teams do that. We didn\u2019t do that too well after the first Test at Lord\u2019s. We didn\u2019t do it after Manchester.\u201d\n\nLanger observed the \u201chollow\u201d feeling they leave England with after tour months having not stuck the landing at The Oval in the Fifth Test, but still appreciates the success of the overall mission when considering the base they were coming off at the start of 2019. Then, they had been thrashed by India on home soil for the first time ever in a Test series. Now, they have a bowling machine to die for. Crucially, it has been recalibrated in a way that has focused on keeping as many of the bowling staff at full fitness through rotation rather than bowling them until they break down.\n\nIf finding room in the team for a slew of superb bowlers is a good problem to have, a less happy poser is how to put together a top six that can bat with Steve Smith for long enough. There is no papering over the fact that there were three changes to Australia\u2019s top six during the series or that by the end of it, Usman Khawaja and vice-captain Travis Head were on the bench. Even Marnus Labuschagne, who Langer is thrilled with the progress of, might not have won an opportunity until deep into the series if not for Jofra Archer knocking out Smith. Matthew Wade did, however, pay off. Two Ashes tons are two Ashes tons, the classy hands surely enough to guarantee a full summer on friendly, home surfaces.\n\nWhich brought Langer to David Warner. \u201cHe thought way too much about it,\u201d the coach said of his beleaguered opener, dismissed a record seven times in ten hits by Stuart Broad, tallying just 95 runs along the way \u2013 a hideous set of numbers by any measure. \u201cHe\u2019ll be very relieved he gets on the Qantas flight and doesn\u2019t have to face Stuart Broad for a while I reckon.\u201d\n\nBut that shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for the ground being laid for Warner\u2019s dumping \u2013 anything but. Langer was quick to issue a reminder about his earlier prolific run-scoring in 2019 before the Ashes. After all, this is a player who clocked 20 Test tons in quicker time than Viv Richards. The last time he had a true stinker of a tour in 2017 in India, floundering against spin, he returned to the subcontinent later in the same year to score two of the Test centuries he is most proud of in Dhaka and Chittagong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over a long period you never write off champion players,\u201d Langer put it. \u201cHe\u2019s had a tough series, no doubt about that, but he\u2019s also a champion player so usually with champion players they get a bit more time to come good. He had this series, it didn\u2019t go to plan, but he\u2019s seen how successful he\u2019s been and the impact he can have on Australian cricket teams winning so I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll come good.\"\n\nSo, some 123 days after their arrival, the Australians depart with the trophy they cherish most and a measured spring in their step. Perhaps just as importantly, the sandpaper drama now really has been put behind them. They may be a long way from dominating as they did for a generation from the mid-1990s, but they are, at last, back in business.
