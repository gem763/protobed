But many older homes still have them, while others are connected to city services by lead service lines.\n\nCities often reduce lead levels in water by footing the expense to remove lead pipes or by adding anti-corrosive chemicals to water.", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will announce new standards for lead in drinking water, Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a radio interview Wednesday.\u00a0Wheeler is set to mak", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/flintwater_030416getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
