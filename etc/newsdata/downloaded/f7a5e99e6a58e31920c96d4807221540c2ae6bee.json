Williams was broken early by Andreescu, who won a coin toss to serve to kick off the highly anticipated matchup but deferred to the 37-year-old icon, who got off to a shaky start. Williams saved five break points to hold her serve in the seventh game but Andreescu remained steady throughout the set, breaking Williams due to a double-fault to clinch the opening set. Andreescu is the first woman since Venus Williams to reach a US Open final in her debut tournament, ESPN reported and if she wins she would have had the fewest number of Grand Slam appearances since Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon in 2004.", "description": "Serena Williams has lost the opening set 6-3 in a best-of-three contest against Canada's Bianca Andreescu Saturday evening in the U.S. Open tennis...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
