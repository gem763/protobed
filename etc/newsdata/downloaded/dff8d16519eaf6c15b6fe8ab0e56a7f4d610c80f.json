After listening to Lottie talk over the expert Lubna said: 'The whole point was to make notes and absorb the knowledge and Lottie kept interrupting and trying to take over.' Lottie then cut in when fellow contestant Jemelin Artigas tried to give directions to which Lubna fired back: 'Sorry can you let her finish please? She's the sub-team leader and you keep interrupting.' Snapping back Lottie said: 'I am contributing, not interrupting and you've just disrupted the entire group so don't be so rude.'\n\nA friend of a candidate is said to have viewed the comments as racist and alerted The Sun, saying that they understood that the pair didn't get on, but that the exchange was 'shocking'.\n\nThey added: 'It was clearly a racist remark. No one said anything including Lubna, who ignored it and rose above it. But it is a pretty stupid thing to say on a group chat. It is way below the belt.'\n\nMahatma Gandhi was murdered when he was 78-years-old. He had led the fight for Indian independence from Britain.\n\nThe comments echo that made during the 2007 series of Big Brother, when Jade Goody referred to Shilpa Shetty as 'Shilpa Poppadom'.\n\nHowever a TV insider has said that these new allegations are not a 'good look for Lottie'\n\nThey added: 'Everyone is bound to liken it to the Jade situation. It may make it difficult for Lottie to get other work if this is deemed a racial insult.'\n\nDuring the show's first episode on Wednesday the pair were seen in South Africa, where they had to pitch ideas for a wine tasting tour.\n\nLubna (pictured above) is said to have called Lottie 'characterless' in one of the chats\n\nThe pair bickered after Lottie spoke over a local wine touring expert.\n\nAfter the first episode aired and after chat in the WhatsApp group escalated, Lottie is said to have sent Lubna some messages privately.\n\nA source said she felt 'threatened and bullied' by Lottie and therefore decided to screenshot the messages.\n\nLast night Lottie is said to have dismissed the messages between the two as a joke.\n\nShe said: 'I appreciate the messages sent between myself and Lubna could come across as offensive but they were intended as a joke and no offence was meant by them.\n\n'With no context I ask individuals not to make judgment. I wish Lubna the best and think she's an intelligent businesswoman with a fantastic future.'\n\nMailOnline has contacted the BBC.", "description": "Lottie Lion has been accused of bullying  Lubna Farhan (pictured), whose parents hail from Pakistan.
