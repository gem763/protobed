Millie had had Special Dog since she was born and slept with him every night, taking him on holiday, to sleepovers, and on school trips.\n\nShe takes Special Dog everywhere and struggles to sleep without him (Picture: SWNS)\n\nFriends and family tried to cheer Millie up with a new toy, but nothing filled the gap left by Special Dog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no way she could be without him,\u2019 said Millie\u2019s mum Lucy, from Felixstowe, Suffolk.\n\n\u2018We were on the plane back home when Millie said: \u201cMummy I wish I had Special Dog\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe rang the hotel as soon as we could and spoke to them right up until we had to put our phones away but they said they couldn\u2019t find him. We were completely in their hands.\n\nHard Rock hotel went above and beyond to reunite Millie with her beloved teddy (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018I knew exactly what happened. When we were leaving Millie was tired and didn\u2019t want to get out of bed so she got dressed in bed and obviously just left Special Dog there.\n\n\u2018We had the whole day to remember but we just didn\u2019t!\n\n\u2018We were really concerned at how we were going to get through it. Family would come round with new teddies but nothing fitted the same, nothing was quite the same although she was very grateful.\n\n\u2018We tried to find a replacement for Special Dog and thought about pretending it was Special Dog but we just knew that she would notice.\u2019\n\nThe family were just beginning to lose hope when they were told the good news from the hotel \u2013 staff had found Special Dog and planned to fly him home.\n\nThe hotel sent him over along with photos of his adventures (Picture: SWNS)\n\nDays later a package arrived address to Millie. Inside was a Hard Rock Cafe lunchbox containing Special Dog, along with a scarf, souvenirs, and photos of the teddy lounging by the water fountain and playing a guitar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillie was overjoyed and promptly burst into tears, in a moving moment captured by her parents on camera.\n\nLucy said: \u2018I think she was a bit overwhelmed with emotion but she was just so happy!\n\n\u2018We thought that Special Dog was lost forever but the hotel really went above and beyond to bring him home and they took some lovely photos of Special Dog enjoying his holiday!\n\n\u2018We couldn\u2019t thank them enough for getting our girl smiling again!\u2019\n\nMORE: Mum hails \u00a39.99 sleep spray as \u2018magic\u2019 for helping her baby sleep through the night\n\nMORE: Mum gives birth to absolutely huge baby girl who weighs 12.9lbs\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Millie McAlpine was devastated when she realised she'd left Special Dog at the Hard Rock hotel in Florida.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/girl-cries-when-reunited-with-her-favourite-teddy_1571205070.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
