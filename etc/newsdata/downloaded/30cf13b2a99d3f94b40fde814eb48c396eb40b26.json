Goldberg\u2019s popular G-File newsletter will go out Friday.\n\nFor now, The Dispatch is free \u2014 unless you fancy yourself a \u201cFounders Membership,\u201d which grants access for life and a few other perks for a cool $1,500.\n\nThe company is launching with eight full-time staffers, Axios reports, and has raised $6 million from investors for its launch.\n\nHave a tip we should know?
