I wasn\u2019t even old enough to legally buy the gun I could lawfully carry as a newly-minted peace officer.\n\nI was proud of this achievement and thoroughly enjoyed the esprit de corps with my classmates and new colleagues.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have body cameras or many of the special tools officers have today but, for the most part, we had what we felt at the time we needed. Particularly we had overwhelming public support \u2013 or at least we felt that way.\n\nPOLICE ADVOCATES TO POLITICIANS: IT'S TIME TO STOP THE 'DEMAGOGUERY' AND BACK AMERICA'S MEN, WOMEN IN BLUE\n\nToday, for a variety of reasons, police don\u2019t feel they have that public support any longer. And they are right. And that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t do it again. At least not under today\u2019s circumstances.\n\nWhen I went to the police academy in 1989, I remember being taught in no uncertain terms that deadly force was authorized to stop a fleeing felon. In other words, we were told we could shoot someone who was a felon if they were running away from us. Fortunately, I was never in a position to test that training.\n\nPolice training in all subjects is now light years ahead of where it was then.\n\nTraining in the area of use of force is even further ahead in my view. Yet it is the polarizing issue of use of force that seems to most affect public perception of police officers today.\n\nPeople nowadays are able to see -- collectively for the first time -- what law officers have always known: there is simply no \"nice\" way to arrest someone who is potentially dangerous and combative.\n\nToday everyone has a high definition video camera at the ready and available to instantly live stream any police activity to a worldwide audience.\n\nPeople nowadays are able to see -- collectively for the first time -- what law officers have always known: there is simply no \"nice\" way to arrest someone who is potentially dangerous and combative.\n\nPolice work can be, by its very nature, quite ugly and violent. It's never like it is on TV or in the movies. But it is real life and involves real people.\n\nWe demand that our police swear to support and defend the Constitution and laws so we must, in turn, judge them -- and their actions -- according to the Constitution and laws as interpreted by the courts.\n\nUnlike the court of public opinion or social media, real courts and investigators don't have the luxury of picking and choosing what parts of the Constitution to apply. In fact, the law prohibits judging police actions through the 20/20 lens of hindsight \u2013 yet, via cell phone videos, that\u2019s what happens in the court of public opinion.\n\nIn what now seems like a prophetic warning about the yet-to-be-invented cell phone video, in 1989 the Supreme Court decided that landmark case of Graham v Connor.\n\nGraham provides that any use of force incident -- deadly or otherwise -- must be \"objectively reasonable\" under the totality of the circumstances and that \"[t]he \"reasonableness\" of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nUnfortunately, this lack of public support has a way of spilling over to police management. Many officers feel their careers might be sacrificed at the altar of public opinion anytime they have to use force.\n\nIn my own legal practice, I\u2019ve seen careers and reputations ruined by defamatory \u201cknee-jerk\u201d press releases issued prior to any meaningful investigation into the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding a use of force incident.\n\nRarely, if ever, are knee jerk decisions helpful \u2013 particularly if based on a single video or social media post.\n\nIf you consider most any cell phone video of police use of force against the backdrop of a pop culture that includes rap music with titles like \u201cF**k The Police\u201d and lyrics such as: \u201cWe need to \u2026 kill cops. Plus stupid, ya stupid, I hope you rot in hell\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see why many officers (and potential recruits) might be inclined to steer away from a career in law enforcement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLaw enforcement is a public service performed by men and women willing to put the best interests of the public ahead of their own. They may be able to live with the low pay, missing holidays with family, or working long inconvenient hours. But in my experience, many just can\u2019t see their way clear to doing the job without public support and nobody wants to work a job where they are not appreciated.\n\nI know I don\u2019t. And that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t do it again.", "description": "I graduated from a Georgia police academy in 1989 at the age of 19.
