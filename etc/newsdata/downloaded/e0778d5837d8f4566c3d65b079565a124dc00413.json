It is forecast to deliver a distribution yield of 6.25 per cent in the 2020 financial year, increasing to 6.5 per cent in FY 2021.\n\nCenturia's joint chief executive Jason Huljich said while Brisbane's office market had been sluggish, he expected to see growth \"ramp up\" six months from now.\n\n\"Brisbane has been a bit stubborn over the last two years. We bought assets a couple of years ago, and we did believe that that market would turn a bit quicker,\" Mr Huljich said.", "description": "Investors are banking on future growth in Brisbane and are also hard-pressed to find quality assets elsewhere.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0209%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_153%2C$y_1293/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6fc358706ad532c195b673258f821a659032a8b8", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
