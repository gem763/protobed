While bleak data has raised prospects for further policy\n\neasing, analysts at OCBC said that a few positive factors, such\n\nas a truce in the trade war, a pickup in infrastructure\n\ninvestment and stabilization of the manufacturing sector may\n\nprompt China's central bank to adopt a wait and see stance.\n\nIn contrast to the disappointing 6% annual growth in GDP,\n\nChina's industrial output grew a better-than-expected 5.8% in\n\nSeptember, faster than the 17-year-low posted in August.\n\nPhilippine shares led declines in Southeast Asia,\n\nwith utilities and financial firms among the biggest drags on\n\nManila's benchmark index which managed to post a second\n\nconsecutive weekly gain.\n\nBDO Unibank and Manila Electric fell 2.6%\n\nand 2.3%, respectively.\n\nSingapore stocks slipped 0.4% to a one-week low, hurt\n\nby weakness in the consumer and financial sectors.

Industrial and financial\n\nstocks led declines on the benchmark index, with Kasikornbank\n\nPcl and real estate developer Asset World Pcl Corp\n\nAWC.BK down 2.2% and 2.9% each.\n\nInvestor focus will now turn to the release of trade data\n\nnext week.
