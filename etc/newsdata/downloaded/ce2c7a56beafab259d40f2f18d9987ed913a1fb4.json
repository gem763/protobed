The whole village came to see her depart on her last journey.\u201d\n\nShe was 53 when she had her first child, a son, by her second husband. She had two more sons, then 10 grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.\n\nHer claim to be the oldest woman in her country was recognised by the Russian Book of Records and evidently the Russian government.\n\n(Image: Russian Record Book; EAST2WEST N)\n\nIf true, it meant she was the oldest person on the planet.\n\nThe secret of her long life - surviving the upheavals of the Russian revolution when she was already 21, and the Soviet collapse along with the tyranny of Stalin was \"optimism and hard work\" - along with drinking kefir.\n\nHer family said her longevity was down to her \u201cnever sitting still\u201d and a \u201chealthy lifestyle\u201d.\n\nShe did not smoke and ate only natural foods and endured many decades of work for which she received a labour award.\n\n(Image: Russian Record Book; EAST2WEST N)\n\n\"She was working all the time in the fields,\u201d said one account.\n\nShintas, her son, now in his 70s, said of his mum several years ago: \"My mother has seen a lot during her long life. She has lived from Rasputin to Putin.\n\nGrigory Rasputin was the 'crazed monk' who held the Russian royal family in his thrall, arguably speeding the demise of the Romanov dynasty.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin is one of a dozen Kremlin rulers during her lifetime.\n\n(Image: Russian Record Book; EAST2WEST N)\n\nOfficials say her birth certificate and internal Russian passport indicated her great age, but sceptics point to this making her 53 when she first gave birth, and 59 when her third son was born.\n\nAn ethnic Kazakh and a Muslim, she was born as the eldest of eight and raised her siblings, marrying after the revolution when she worked as a labourer on a Soviet collective farm.\n\nShe had no children before her first husband went missing during the Second World War.\n\nYet she found happiness during Stalin's final decade in power, say her family, after marrying Musagali Bisembeev, 16 years her senior.\n\n(Image: Zhizn; EAST2WEST NEWS)\n\nSon Shintas said: \"My mother met my father in 1946. She was 50 and he was over 60 but he was a strong man, he worked at the collective farm and did as much as two men would do.\n\n\"After the war my parents lived in a soldier's shelter and their first son died in his babyhood.\n\n\"They were so poor that could not afford a proper house, and probably this is why their baby son died.\n\n\u201cYou could not heat such room properly.\n\n\"But later they had three more sons, just think about it.\n\n\"I was born when my mother was 53 and the youngest brother was born when she was 59. It still sounds incredible.\n\n\n\n\u201cLife was not easy and they were often hungry then. I still remember being five years old and already helping my parents with the hay.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nDespite being Russia's oldest citizen, she hardly spoke the language, instead preferring her native Kazakh tongue.\n\nNeighbour Valentina Akbasova said three years ago: \"She is so gentle. She will always hug you and kiss and ask how you feel, she was always eager to help.\"\n\nTanzilya is believed to have lived through the rule of Nicholas II, Kerensky, Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Putin, and Medvedev (succeeded by Putin again in 2012).\n\n(Image: Russian Record Book; EAST2WEST N)\n\nTwo other Russian women Koku Istambulova, purportedly 129, and Nanu Shaova, listed as 128, both died earlier this year.\n\nA problem with recognising such claims is the lack of original documentation of their births partly due to the turmoil of revolution and war in Russia.\n\nThe oldest documented human lifespan is Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived 122 years, 164 days, dying in 1997.\n\nAs a girl she met Vincent van Gogh.\n\nIn March this year Kane Tanaka from Fukuoka, Japan, was officially confirmed as the oldest verified living person at 116 years.", "description": "Tanzilya Bisembeyeva 'lived from Rasputin to Putin' and put her old age down to drinking kefir - fermented milk", "authors": ["Will Stewart", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Russian Record Book", "N", "Zhizn", "News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20761408.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAIN-Russias-120-year-old-Tanzilya-Bisembeyeva.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
