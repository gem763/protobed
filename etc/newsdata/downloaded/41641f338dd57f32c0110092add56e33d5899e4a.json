He thought his Week 2 hit on Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield was clean.\n\nA couple of days later, when the NFL fined him $21,056 for the roughing the passer penalty he was furious and ripped the league on social media as \u201ca damn joke.\u201d\n\nBut Thursday, Adams won his appeal of the fine, and giving him a rare reason for celebration in this frustrating Jets season.\n\n\u201cHa ha! I told y\u2019all, if you just listened to me,\u201d Adams said Thursday, breaking into a celebratory dance as he spoke to reporters. \u201cI\u2019m going to be completely honest and I\u2019m going to tell you, straight-up: I knew I was going to win it, because it was legal.\u201d\n\nAdams was penalized for a borderline hit on Mayfield: he hit the quarterback with his left arm and shoulder near the sideline as a running Mayfield threw a pass. Adams\u2019 helmet cape close to hitting Mayfield\u2019s, but replays weren\u2019t definitive. Adams also appeared to turn his head out of the way just before contact.\n\nWhen the flag was thrown, Adams immediately shook his head in disbelief and let the officials know he wasn\u2019t pleased. And when he was fined, he let the whole world know how he felt, bashing the NFL on social media for its \u201csoft rules protecting QBs\u201d adding \u201cI signed up to play football not two hand touch. Bull----!\u201d\n\nAug 29, 2019; East Rutherford, NJ, USA; New York Jets strong safety Jamal Adams (33) reacts during warm ups before a game against the Philadelphia Eagles at MetLife Stadium.

Thursday was her birthday, and Adams said he planned to use the fine money to buy her a gift.\n\n\u201cHa-ha! I got that, what was it, like 22 back in my pocket?\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that it wasn\u2019t taken out, because now I can spend that lovely money on my mother.\u201d\n\nAdams said that he understands why the league has rules and why players must play within them \u201cto make it as safe as possible.\u201d But he also made it clear that he\u2019s not a fan of the direction the league is going with those rules, because it makes it difficult for a physical player like him.\n\n\u201cAs a safety, obviously I don\u2019t agree with a lot of things,\u201d Adams said. \u201cBut it happens and we\u2019ve got to adjust our level of play and how we play the game of football.\u201d\n\nBut Adams said he won\u2019t let the rules alter his hard-hitting style of play\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been a dirty guy, but I am full-throttle when I\u2019m on the field,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m never trying to take cheap shots at anybody, but at the same time I\u2019m all about playing fast football. That\u2019s never going to change for me.\u201d\n\nAdams, who made the Pro Bowl last season, seems to be striking the right balance. He hasn\u2019t picked up a penalty since the Browns game and has only two unnecessary roughness penalties in 36 career games, according to NFLpenalties.com", "description": "Jets safety Jamal Adams had a rare reason to celebrate Thursday in what has been a frustrating season for the Jets.", "authors": ["Andy Vasquez", "Published P.M.
