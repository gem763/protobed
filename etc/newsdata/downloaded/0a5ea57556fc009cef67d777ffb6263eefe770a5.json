The Dealmaster is back with a special batch of deals to share for Columbus Day. Amazon is currently having a sale on a number of Xbox One and PS4 games, many of which normally go for $50 to $60 but are now priced much lower.\n\nNotable titles such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil 2, and Mortal Kombat 11 are all at the lowest prices we've seen, or close to it, but the sale also includes brand-new titles as well. Gears 5 Control , and Borderlands 3 , all of which came out within the past two months, are the newest and arguably biggest titles on sale right, and now you can get Gears 5 and Control for around $37.50 and Borderlands 3 for $44.99.\n\nAlmost all of the games in Amazon's sale have extra discounts tacked on at checkout, so don't be alarmed if you don't see the sale price immediately when you add them to your cart. The additional savings will be accounted for when you see the final price right before you place your order.\n\nWhile these are some of the lowest prices we've seen for these games, it's possible that Black Friday and Cyber Monday bring even steeper discounts. That's never a guarantee, but Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the next occasions when we could expect video game discounts like these before the end of the year. We're also unsure how long this Amazon sale will run, so fi there's a title you've been eyeing, it may be worth it to snag it sooner rather than later.\n\nDealmaster: An Ars newsletter The Dealmaster is launching its very own newsletter!
