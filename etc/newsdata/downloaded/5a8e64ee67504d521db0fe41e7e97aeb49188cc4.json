Gavin Newsom not to sign a \"Fair Pay\" bill that would allow student-athletes to accept endorsement money, arguing that the legislation would \"upend the balance\" of the collegiate athlete system.\n\nWhy it matters: The board of governors argues in a letter to Newsom that the bill would \"erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics\" and give schools \"unfair recruiting advantages\" \u2014 making them ineligible to compete in NCAA competitions. If the bill is passed, California would be the only state in the country that allows college athletes to be paid.", "description": "The NCAA claims the bill would \"upend the balance\" of the collegiate athlete system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/OGgIn1fjbZwx_GS2BytWyTWOT3U=/0x195:5520x3300/1920x1080/2019/09/11/1568218241316.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
