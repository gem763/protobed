Elizabeth Warren.\n\nMeg Kinnard/AP\n\nSanders drew a contrast between himself and Biden, the front-runner, when asked to comment on the former vice president's campaign trail gaffes. He criticized Biden\u2019s record on trade deals, the war in Iraq, and the bank bailout.\n\n\u201cJoe and I have our differences in terms of vision for the future,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHowever, The View hosts pointed out that fellow presidential candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren espouses many of the same views -- a similarity that might make it difficult for him to distinguish himself. The lawmaker said that there is room for more than one candidate with similar stances in the Democratic field.\n\n\"Elizabeth is a friend of mine. She and I have known each other well over 20 years. She's going to run her campaign and I will run my campaign,\" Sanders said.\n\nStill, Sanders, who said he has more than 1 million campaign volunteers, believes that his grassroots supporters will give him the edge he needs to secure the nomination.\n\nThe Vermont senator also said he was \u201cnot a great fan\u201d of how the Democratic National Committee has hosted debates this campaign cycle. Sanders said he\u2019d rather see single-issue debates with extended time to answer questions.\n\n\u201cDo it issue by issue rather than trying to deal with 50 different issues in a short period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called for the elimination of superdelegates, delegates who are free to support any candidate at at the Democratic National convention and have in the past wielded powerful influence on who becomes the eventual party nominee. After 2016 the DNC changed the rules to limit the superdelegates' roles at the convention.\n\n\u201cI would ban superdelegates from voting on any ballot,\u201d Sanders.\n\nSanders who often mentions taxing big corporations on the campaign trail was asked by The View\u2019s Whoopi Goldberg, if he would make large companies pay more in taxes.\n\n\u201cDo you realize that if Facebook and Amazon and all the other gigantic corporations paid any tax, we could find some relief for regular Americans?\u201d Goldberg asked.\n\n\u201cOf course, I'll change it,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cI have been talking about it for 25 years.\n\nIn the weeks prior to his slated appearance on the daytime talk show, Sanders has crisscrossed the country touting what is widely considered the cornerstone of his campaign, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The health care plan eliminates private health insurance provided by employers and transitions to a government-run plan. Sanders promises that his plan would mean an end to insurance copayments, deductibles, premiums and other out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\"The function of a rational health care system is not to make billions for insurance companies and drug companies,\u201d said Sanders at a campaign stop in Florence, South Carolina on Friday. \u201cIt is to provide health care to every man, woman, and child as a human right.\"\n\nHis plan has drawn criticism from his 2020 rivals including former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nDuring his trip to South Carolina, Sanders teased an additional plan that would cancel $81 million in medical debt, prevent medical debt from negatively impacting credit scores and eliminate portions of the 2005 bankruptcy bill that make it more difficult to get rid of medical debt.\n\n\u201cWhy should people be placed in financial duress? For what crime did you commit?,\u201d Sanders told supporters in Florence, South Carolina. \u201cYou had a serious illness. That is not what this country should be about, but I think when we move to Medicare for All, we will end bankruptcy, and we will end families having to suffer financially.\u201d\n\nSanders confirmed a more detailed plan on the topic is in the works.\n\n\u201cIt is an insane cruel system that says you have to go deeply into debt or go bankrupt because of what?\u201d Sanders told reporters. \u201cBecause they came down with cancer, they came down with heart disease, they came down with Alzheimer\u2019s or whatever.\u201d\n\nThis is the latest policy proposal from the Sanders campaign designed to tackle the rise of health care costs.\n\nIn July, Sanders took a trip to Canada to highlight the increasing prices of prescription drugs in the U.S.\n\nIn what was the first foreign trip of his 2020 presidential campaign, the senator joined a bus of diabetes patients on a drive from Detroit to Canada where the patients purchased insulin at prices that some said were 90% cheaper than what they would find in the U.S. The trip was inspired by a bus trip Sanders took two decades ago when he accompanied breast cancer patients into Canada to buy prescription drugs at similarly reduced prices.", "description": "Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders appeared on ABC's The View.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/bernie-sanders-8-30-ap-ml-190904_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
