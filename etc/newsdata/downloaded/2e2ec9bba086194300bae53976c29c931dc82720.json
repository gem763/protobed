The stone will be placed at the new health department building.\n\nEvery time he hears a siren, the three fighters who perished come to mind, Moropane's father, Robert, who spoke on behalf of the three families, said.\n\nHe said although their death was tragic, they were proud of the courage and bravery the men showed while serving the people of South Africa.\n\nAs Morapane's father spoke, his wife, Mahlatse, and mother, Lucy, kept their eyes on the building where construction is under way. Morapane's two young daughters, aged 4 and 1, were sitting on their laps.\n\n\"They had a tough job but they were determined to doing their job to the best of their ability. Each time I see a fire engine I think of them and say if they were alive, they would be in those trucks' because they loved their jobs,\" he said.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku said the tragedy of that day exposed a need for the department to investigate the state of buildings in the city.\n\nFamilies of three firefighters who lost their lives in a fire at the Bank of Lisbon building in 2018 lay wreaths outside the building. (Sesona Ngqakamba, News24)\n\nHe said the department remained committed to ensuring adherence to operational health and safety standards in all facilities.\n\n\"The loss of firefighters we are honouring today came at the time where government was grappling with infrastructure, overwhelmed by the demographic challenges that come with rapid urbanisation,\" he said.\n\nMasuku said the government had been made aware that Day Zero was possible in Gauteng, which meant water resources were likely to be depleted.\n\nHe said the fight to keep urban areas safe depended on brave emergency services officials, adding that the death of one worker was one too many.\n\n\"We also recognise the nature of work we do, as the department, takes its toll on our staff members. Working in health is a 24-hour job that requires mental health strength and support. At the core of our priorities, as the department, is the improvement of staff morale, which includes providing mental health support,\" Masuku said.\n\nMasuku conveyed his appreciation to the firefighters.", "description": "Families, friends and colleagues from various Gauteng government departments have gathered outside the Bank of Lisbon building to honour and remember three firefighters who died there a year ago.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8180/c6ca8e878ebc41b89608513d61dd2a83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
