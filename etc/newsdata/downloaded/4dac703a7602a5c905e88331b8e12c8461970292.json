Besides getting to the store early to pick out your supplies, we have one important advance-notice life hack: patch test anything you plan to slather all over your \u2014 or your kid\u2019s \u2014 face.\n\nIrritating or allergenic ingredients are common in cosmetics of all kinds, because everybody\u2019s skin is different. A lipstick that doesn\u2019t bother your friend might make your lips raw and puffy. (Arguably you should patch-test all your cosmetics, although many of us don\u2019t bother.) Halloween makeup is a special concern because it\u2019s usually something you haven\u2019t used before, and in many cases you\u2019re planning to spend a whole evening with the stuff all over your face.\n\nSo here\u2019s how to do a proper patch test:\n\nApply a small amount of the makeup to the inside of your forearm or elbow, or to another area where skin tends to be sensitive but also not too noticeable. (Other options: the side of your neck, or behind your ear)\n\nLeave it there for 24 hours or as long as possible. Cover it with a bandage if you\u2019re worried about smearing.\n\nCheck the area for any redness, swelling, itching, or discomfort.\n\nIf the makeup irritates your skin, you shouldn\u2019t wear it. If the makeup is for a kid, make sure you test it on their skin \u2014 just because something is fine on your own elbow doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all clear for someone else. Remember, people are different. You can also develop an allergy or sensitivity to something you\u2019ve worn without issue in the past.", "description": "Have you figured out the perfect costume idea to wear this Halloween?
