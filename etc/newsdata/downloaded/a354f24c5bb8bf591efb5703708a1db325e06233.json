The company was founded and run by Boris Johnson\u2019s friend Jennifer Arcuri after she had moved back to the US.\n\nJames said she would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if Johnson had had any involvement in awarding the grant, but admitted the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Skills [DCMS] made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d in awarding the money to Arcuri\u2019s company.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, she said: \u201cIt is a complete mystery to me how this company got anywhere near the money.\u201d\n\nThe DCMS has launched a review into how the grant was made and withheld \u00a353,000 that is yet to be transferred to Hacker House.\n\nJames, who resigned as a minister a week before Johnson became prime minister, said: \u201cI\u2019m totally appalled that the money was awarded to this company. Although it didn\u2019t get my sign-off I was the minister responsible at the time, so that\u2019s why I want to know now, belatedly, what happened.\u201d\n\nMatt Warman, a DCMS undersecretary, insisted last week that the department had done the \u201cusual due diligence\u201d over Hacker House before awarding the money.\n\n\u201cThis is a company that is based in Britain as far as Companies House is concerned. It is a company with a British phone number,\u201d he told the Commons. But when the Guardian phoned the UK number it got through to the US and when a reporter visited its UK-registered address he was told it was a \u201cvirtual office\u201d and staff were based elsewhere.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margot James said doubts about Hacker House\u2019s links to the UK were \u2018obvious a mile off\u2019.

She added: \u201cAnyone can register at Companies House and provide a British number.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that the grant was designed to foster UK skills and was eligible only for genuinely UK-based companies. \u201cWe need the digital skills gap to be closed in the UK, not the bloody US,\u201d she said.\n\nJames said she was alarmed to discover that in the case of Hacker House, the DCMS appeared to have waived a requirement for grants not to be awarded if they exceeded 50% of the company\u2019s turnover.\n\nAsked if she thought officials had been hoodwinked, she said: \u201cI think that is the kindest explanation. I didn\u2019t insist on ministerial oversight of the various applications. Perhaps I should have done with the benefit of hindsight. I would have look at the revenues and thought what\u2019s going on here. We don\u2019t want startups, we need companies with a proven track record.\u201d\n\nJames also called for a \u201cfull and frank\u201d review into what went wrong and for the department to avoid a government tendency to \u201cclose ranks\u201d. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has got any chance of sweeping it under the carpet. It is too out in the open now.\u201d\n\nSeparately, it has emerged that when Arcuri first launched a website for Hacker House in 2015, it included a promotional video featuring Johnson endorsing her previous company, Innotech, and referring to Arcuri by her first name.\n\nIn the video, Johnson says: \u201cViva Innotech folks, and forward with all your deliberations. Will that do, Jennifer? Can I go now?\u201d", "description": "Margot James says it was a \u2018big mistake\u2019 to award government cash to US entrepreneur\u2019s firm", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6c8c72ede0f174dbe276c49fd670823", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
