That's not very glamorous, in itself. Yet that dull-sounding business became \"disruptive,\" in Silicon Valley jargon.\n\nThe most disruptive thing about it may have been the antics of its hard-partying co-founder, Adam Neumann. As The Wall Street Journal reported, Neumann transported marijuana stuffed in a cereal box across international boundaries in a private jet.\n\nWhat is the WeWork business plan, anyway? They basically offer open office space, Wi-Fi and coffee. They invented ... Starbucks?\n\nThe mess at WeWork continues to simmer. Neumann stepped down as chief executive in September, but the company has had to put off its initial public offering of stock, and it continues to lose enormous sums of money.\n\nI can hardly wait to read the book about WeWork, once somebody writes it. Disruptive companies make great reads. \"Super Pumped,\" the new book about Uber, the ride-hailing giant, written by my colleague Mike Isaac, has become one of my favourites.\n\nHe described Uber's corporate excesses, including a private multimillion-dollar Las Vegas party featuring superstar Beyonc\u00e9, as well as numerous incidents of lawbreaking and a toxic culture for women.\n\nGoing over Niagara Falls in a barrel is exhilarating. Compound interest is not.\n\nUber bid its founder, Travis Kalanick, goodbye as chief executive in 2017 (he remains on the board of directors), and it has been on a more stable management footing. But the company continues to be a money loser. In August, it posted a quarterly loss of $5.2 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a terrific read about a company that flew high, then crashed and burned in scandal, don't miss \"Bad Blood\" by John Carreyrou. It is about Theranos, the blood test company, a stock market wonder not so long ago, and now, an example of enormous fraud.\n\nBooks like these have found a proud place on my virtual bookshelf (I'm an audiobook guy) and provide wholesome diversion from political news.\n\nThere is one major problem, though: this kind of excitement makes for riveting entertainment, but it isn't necessarily what you want in an investment portfolio.\n\nGoing over Niagara Falls in a barrel is exhilarating. Compound interest is not, yet it is more likely to float you safely to retirement.\n\nIf you're worried (and what rational person isn't?), you can buffer your portfolio with conservative choices, bulking up on funds with bonds and money-market securities.\n\nI have to admit that when my own future is involved, I am fully committed to being boring. Boring is the new sexy.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Lately, some of the tech unicorns look more like dogs.
