She was 40 years old.\n\nBelgian athlete Vervoort announced her intentions to die by euthanasia during the Rio Paralympic Games in 2016, if her condition continued to decrease her quality of life. She said at the time that her sport gave her a reason to keep living.\n\nNews Explains: The right to die in Australia Terminally-ill Victorians can legally ask their doctor for lethal drugs to take their own lives under the nation\u2019s only euthanasia laws. Will other states follow?\n\n\"I'm still enjoying every little moment,\" she said in a news conference in Rio. \"When the moment comes, when I have more bad days than good days, then I have my euthanasia papers, but the time is not there yet.\"\n\nVervoort had signed her euthanasia papers in 2008. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium.\n\nVervoort was 14 when she was diagnosed with the degenerative disease, which left her in constant pain, paralysed her legs, and made it almost impossible to sleep.\n\nRelated: This Victorian woman became the first to use new euthanasia laws, and Nikki Gemmell opens up about not being able to be there for her mother's euthanasia.\n\nBut her passion for sport provided some respite - she excelled in wheelchair basketball, swimming and triathlons.\n\nBut sprinting was her specialty. Vervoort won the 100m gold and 200m silver wheelchair races at the 2012 London Paralympic Games, and the 400m silver and 100m bronze in Rio in 2016.\n\nShe confirmed in Rio that it would be her last games, because her eyesight had begun deteriorating and she had also developed epilepsy.\n\n\"After the Paralympic Games, when I quit, I'm going to enjoy every little moment in my life and I'm going to put more energy in my family and friends, which I couldn't do with top sports because I had to train every day,\" she said in 2016.\n\nVervoort also said in Rio that having the signed euthanasia papers gave her the courage to keep living, and that she didn't think euthanasia should be thought of as \"murder\".\n\n\"It gives a feeling of rest to people,\" she had said. \"I know when it's enough for me, I have those papers.\"\n\nVervoort has spoken of only being able to sleep for 10 minutes a night due to unbearable pain, and said just watching her was enough to make some others pass out.\n\n\"It's too hard for my body,\" she said in an interview at the Rio games.\n\n\"Each training I'm suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard \u2014 to push literally all my fear and everything away.\"\n\nAlso at the Rio games, Vervoort had said she was pushing back the day she would die, but she knew it could come any time - for her and for everyone.\n\nSign up to our whimn.com.au newsletter for more stories like this.\n\n\"You have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments,\" she said. \"Everybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.\"\n\nShe said she wanted to be remembered as someone who was \"always laughing, always smiling\".\n\n\"For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up. For me it's something peaceful.\"", "description": "A degenerative muscle disease had left her barely able to sleep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1f6f0b3483368f6577748c62fe33a872", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
