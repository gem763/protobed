In one area about 150 yards away from the proposed construction work, counters registered 9.2 \u00b5Sv/h (microSieverts per hour), or 45 times above normal levels.

That was a time when Russia looked to reverse, in Joseph Stalin\u2019s words, \u201cfifty or a hundred years\u201d of backwardness in ten years. Achieving that giant leap meant cutting corners on nuclear safety, the dangers of which were not completely understood at the time.\n\n\u201cMy aunt worked as a sample collector at the factory in the early fifties,\u201d says Kondratiev. \u201cShe was just 18 when she started and they never told her the truth of what she was working with. All she remembers is getting two big, painful injections every year.\u201d\n\nFor many decades, the activity of the Polymetals factory remained a state secret. The full extent of what it produced will likely never be revealed. But we do know it was primarily concerned with extracting uranium and thorium from ores. It disposed of thousands of tonnes of waste products from these processes in areas adjacent to the factory.\n\nThe Polymetals factory was not the only plant in Russia \u2013 or the world \u2013 to disperse of radioactive waste so incautiously. The Soviet network of institutes and factories left hundreds of such dumps across the country. But the volume of byproducts, and the tens of thousands now living nearby, make the plant\u2019s legacy particularly troublesome.\n\nIn 1999, Radon, the agency of the Russian government responsible for securing radiological waste, made a major survey of the site. That inspection revealed 40 separate zones of contamination, and authorities immediately embarked on an operation to make the area safe. But they stopped short of a full decontamination operation. In a 2006 interview, Alexander Barinov, Radon\u2019s chief engineer for Moscow, explained that removing all the contaminated soil was \u201cimpossible\u201d. Instead, engineers chose to lay new soil every year to keep the waste buried.\n\nCheryl Rofer, a retired US scientist and nuclear specialist, agrees a full decontamination would be prohibitive on cost grounds \u201cfor most countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cDecontamination would mean the removal of an enormous amount of soil, and other things,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cAnd there would have to be a place to put it.\u201d\n\nRofer, who oversaw remediation of the disposal pits at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States, where the first nuclear bomb was developed, cautions that the activists\u2019 claims of radioactive clouds were exaggerated. That said, road and bridge construction in the area is not \u201cnot a great idea\u201d, especially given the population nearby.\n\n\u201cBuilding work can open things up and allow material to escape in other ways,\u201d she says. \u201cThe thing about old disposal areas is that they always have surprises in store.\u201d\n\nMoscow city authorities seem to have pressed on with plans for the highway despite pushback by experts. A 2013 document seen by The Independent shows, for example, that the management of the former Polymetals plant initially refused the proposed routing. It was only four years later that management eventually acceded to the plans \u2013 and this only after being called in by Moscow City Hall.\n\nPavel Tarasov, a municipal deputy for the Communist Party backing local protests against the highway, says authorities had presided over a \u201ccover-up\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey know about the radiation danger, but the only thing that matters is their multibillion-dollar project,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t get the thing through legally, so they are lying.\u201d\n\nMoscow officials have denied any illegal activity and have promised to continue monitoring the site.\n\nMoscow authorities also insist radiation does not exceed normal range at the highway construction zone. A consultation is ongoing.\n\nIn a statement to the Moscow City Duma, Rafik Zagrutdinov, the interim head of the city\u2019s department of construction insisted that radiation did not exceed norms.\n\n\u201cAll the necessary engineering and geological surveys have been carried out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe results of the survey showed no excess of the radiation background.\u201d\n\nStepan Kalmykov, interim dean of Moscow State University\u2019s chemistry faculty, urges against \u201cexcessive radiophobia\u201d. Radon, he says, has plans for further decontamination of the area. That would include more soil removal and \u201cengineering solutions\u201d to create barriers to stop leakage. The radionuclides found near the Polymer plant \u2013 uranium, thorium and radium \u2013 do not justify alarmism.\n\n\u201cThese are naturally occurring radionuclides, albeit at higher concentrations,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as reducing risk is feasible, it should be done. But as a professional, I can only smile at the comparisons being made to Fukushima and Chernobyl.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kalmykov, Russia\u2019s incautious nuclear past also lent an advantage.\n\n\u201cIn the race for nuclear defence, we became a leader in recklessness,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now \u2013 by accident \u2013 we have become leaders in decontamination. Our engineers have already done enormous work across the country. There\u2019s no reason for them not to do a good job here.\u201d", "description": "Up a small hill from the Moskvorechye commuter station in southeastern Moscow, there is a hole in a green corrugated fence.\u00a0Radioactive warning signs, fly-posted by a group of local activists, are a\u00a0clue\u00a0to the mystery on\u00a0the other side.", "authors": ["Oliver Carroll"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/26/09/img-2821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
