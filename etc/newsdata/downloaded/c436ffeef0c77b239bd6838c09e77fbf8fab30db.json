(Photo: Kevin Baker, Netflix)\n\nNetflix\u2019s The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance has arrived, and people have been raving about this groundbreaking series \u2014 both for its technical prowess and the powerful fantasy story. This includes Gizmodo's own James Whitbrook and Beth Elderkin, who decided to dig into everything they loved about the series so far and where they hope things go from here, should the show get another season (knock on crystal).\n\nBeth Elderkin: Another world, another time, in the age of wonder... we watched a kickass television show. James, you and I have been privately getting psyched about The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance for weeks now, but now we\u2019re talking about it for real. How are you feeling after finally finishing the first season?\n\nJames Whitbrook: Well, after the wild wait of seeing the first five episodes in advance, I only really had half the season to binge this past weekend \u2014 but it just made the wait all that more worth it, because I loved it to pieces. It\u2019s such a... fun is perhaps not the most apt word to describe Age of Resistance, but it soothed my soul.\n\nBeth: I was fortunate that I got to watch the full season before writing my review, which isn\u2019t something that always happens. Of course, since no one else at Gizmodo had yet, that made me downright antsy, so eager to dive into every facet of this beautiful 10-episode debut season.\n\nI practically devoured this show, like a gluttonous Skeksis, bones and all. Which is amazing, considering I knew very little about The Dark Crystal as a franchise before prepping for the new series. I didn\u2019t grow up with the movie at all, watched it for the first time a few months ago. What was your history with The Dark Crystal before coming into the prequel show?\n\nJames: I loved puppet shows growing up as a child, everything from the Muppet movies to proper old school Gerry Anderson Supermarionation shows like Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, so The Dark Crystal was part of all that, too. Except, unlike all those other puppet shows, it was the one that just FREAKED ME THE HELL OUT.\n\nI think I was maybe 5-ish years old when I\u2019d first seen it, which is both the perfect time to have seen it and also the worst! I love the movie, but it\u2019d had been a while since I\u2019d seen it, so I rewatched it waiting for the new show. I really thought it held up, despite it being a very measured film, paced in a way that\u2019s very unfamiliar to the movies of today \u2014 I\u2019m interested to see what you thought of it as a first-time viewer!\n\nBeth: So, I enjoyed the film, but more for what wasn\u2019t there than what was. The film itself is beautiful, but a little outdated. However, I was intrigued by the larger mystery of Aughra, the Gelfling, and the big wide world of Thra. What happened to the Gelfling? Why were the UrSkeks separated? Why was Aughra missing an eye?\n\nAll of these questions, and a lot more, were brought to life in the expanded lore. I\u2019m not much of an Expanded Universe person, but I found myself digging into this world and falling in love with all of its promise. Which made the show feel all-the-sweeter, because of how it honoured the canon and vision.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t watched yet (why haven\u2019t you watched yet?!), The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance \u2014 which takes place \u201csome time\u201d before the events of the film \u2014 centres around three young Gelfling who uncover a shocking secret that the Skeksis are draining Gelfling for their life essence.\n\nThey find the courage to rise up against them, inspiring their friends and family to do the same. One thing I loved about the show was the time it took to bring our heroes together, giving each of them a few episodes to develop their own personalities and stories. Which one of the three protagonists stood out to you the most?\n\nJames: Ugh, this is so hard \u2014 it\u2019s twee to say, but I genuinely loved all of their journeys, and especially that the series took the time to delve into their individual arcs instead of just smooshing them all together and keeping them that way for much of the show. Push comes to shove, it\u2019s probably a toss-up between Brea and Deet.\n\nBrea\u2019s familial drama and her bond with her sisters I thought was beautifully done, and then Deet was just so charming from the get-go, and her story becomes the real dark, bittersweet undercurrent of the season in a way that really intrigued me. But I liked Rian and Hup a lot too! I do wish there was more time with Hup though, he sort of disappears for a bit in the back half. He\u2019s so goofy and fun.\n\nBeth: Hup is too precious for this world, but not too precious for this show. I wanted more of Hup too. I loved both Brea and Deet...albeit for different reasons. I loved Deet for her earnestness and charm \u2014 and also Nathalie Emmanuel\u2019s sweet performance \u2014 which made her sacrifice all-the-more heartbreaking. But I feel like Brea had a resolve in her character that the others did not.\n\nI think it came from climbing out the shadow of her family\u2019s expectations and forging her own path. Sad to say, I think more needs to be done with Rian. He\u2019s a fine character, and Taron Egerton is trying his hardest, but he\u2019s just not clicking for me yet. Right now, he feels a bit too generic.\n\nJames: I think it\u2019s because Rian had to bear the load of being the more atypical protagonist \u2014 he has to find the sword, fight the fights, be the leader of the resistance, and all that. I think now that they\u2019ve established all that, and they\u2019ve also set out the relationship between him and Deet, he can get a bit of a meatier arc if (or rather hopefully, when) the show gets a second season.\n\nSeladon gives herself a makeover. (Image: Netflix)\n\nBeth: Yeah, the showrunners indicated that Brea\u2019s going to be the voice of the resistance, which gives Rian space to find his own voice. Speaking of Brea and her family, I really want to talk about Seladon. I found that character arc to be fascinating, and way deeper and more thoughtful than you\u2019d think would come out of a show like this.\n\nJames: God, what a journey you go on with her! You hate her, you love her, you feel so sorry for Seladon. It would\u2019ve been so easy for her heel turn to be just that, but to redeem her the way the series does not only felt very timely \u2014 in that it is a story arc that\u2019s about making the choice to side with your own oppressor \u2014 it felt earned.\n\nI was totally expecting the easy way out that Seladon\u2019s journey would be that she sides with the Skeksis and they immediately just bump her off, and her punishment for betraying her people was death. But instead making her live with that decision, and process it as she realises just how cruel and awful the Skeksis are, and it becoming the strength she needs to side with her sister and the Resistance in the last battle, was extremely well done.\n\nBeth: When she donned the finery of the Skeksis, modelling herself in their image, I was speechless. The whole thing about the Skeksis is that their bodies are frail, so they adorn themselves in layers of finery and puffed-up armour to make themselves look bigger and more intimidating.\n\nTheir biggest form of humiliation \u2014 since they\u2019re not supposed to kill each other \u2014 is to be stripped of their clothing, left weak and exposed. She was scared of being exposed too, but for different reasons than the Skeksis. When they stripped her of her finery, all she was left with was her mistakes.\n\nJames: Actually, can we pause and just say how good that costume was as a look for Seladon though. The blues! The crown! Fabulous.\n\nBeth: Oh yeah, Seladon needs to design the looks for the resistance. She knows her stuff.\n\nJames: But on that point, I\u2019m so glad you said that, because the thing I loved the most was that the deep blue dress underneath it all is what she remains in for the rest of the season after the Skeksis rip the finery off of it \u2014 it\u2019s symbolic that she\u2019s changed in some way, she doesn\u2019t go back to those Vapra colours of cool blues and greys.\n\nShe remains hardened by what she goes through and realises, but the artifice, all that extra detail, has just been cast away from it. It was a beautiful bit of costume detailing that added to her story.\n\nBeth: I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Brea and Seladon\u2019s relationship is handled in the (hopeful) second season.\n\nOK, before we get into the technical feats of this show, and oh boy, there are some feats, I do want to chat about the Skeksis for a second... and their performances. I was blown away. Simon Pegg, Awkwafina, Jason Isaacs! The actors were committed to making these Skeksis distinct and terrifying... and in a way where you could actually understand them this time. If I was a kid watching these things, I would\u2019ve hid under the bed by episode three... or whenever they do that creepy thing to The Scientist and take away his eye. Good lord.\n\nJames: I\u2019m gonna say it, because I can\u2019t not say it... but mmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\nBeth: Yes!\n\nJames: That sound! It\u2019s just perfectly haunting and alien and cruel in a way that sums up the Skeksis so well \u2014 Simon Pegg does such a great job of emulating the original voice actor, Barry Dennen, for it.\n\nBeth: Pegg killed it as The Chamberlain. I know you watched the behind-the-scenes documentary too \u2014 which, side note, it\u2019s required viewing \u2014 but watching him perform those scenes was inspiring. Any other Skeksis faves?\n\nJames: Oh, Mark Hamill as The Scientist is definitely the other stand out. But they\u2019re all so good overall! I really appreciated that the show just sort of reveled in how excessive and gross the Skeksis have become even at this point \u2014 like, their hedonism by the time of the movie isn\u2019t just something that\u2019s been expounded by their (at that point) victory over the Gelfling, it\u2019s just something that\u2019s always been there, exacerbated by The Darkening.\n\nBeth: And they even expand into the loner Skeksis, who interact with their vices in other ways. Like the Hunter... and one of my favourites, the Heretic. Played by Andy Samberg, who was channeling some Frank Oz vibes with his performance. Actually, the Heretic is a great segue into talking about the technical feats of this show, because there\u2019s that beautiful exposition scene told as a puppet show within a puppet show.\n\nWhat were your overall thoughts on the technical achievements of the show? Any favourites? Anything that simply blew you away? For me, it\u2019s Lore the Rock Creature, plain and simple.\n\nJames: Once again, this is like, the Sophie\u2019s Choice of Age of Resistance. There\u2019s just so many mind-blowing moments with the puppetry going on in this series that you can\u2019t help but be baffled. Lore definitely stands out and like you said, the puppet show-within-a-puppet show.\n\nBut honestly, the thing that surprised me the most watching the documentary afterward was that at least some of the Arathim were practical puppets. When the trailers were being released I thought they\u2019d all be CG, and were honestly the most jarring aspect of everything they were showing off.\n\nBut not only did they work in the show, they did such a good job between blending the puppet work and the CG work that I was genuinely astounded by the reveal they had some of them be puppets.\n\nALSO: Podling butts. That whole sequence with Brea having to work with the order of lesser service to clean dirty podlings had me in stitches.\n\nPodling butts! (Photo: Kevin Baker, Netflix)\n\nBeth: I was just so impressed with how much love you could see went into the work being crafted. When I first interviewed the show creators, they said how, early in the development process, the Jim Henson Company told them how excited they were that the show was going to be announced... because the moment they did, they wouldn\u2019t have to scout for people.\n\nThe talent was going to come to them. And it did. Some of the best and brightest folks in their fields came together for this project, and the proof is there on the screen. You also have to give all the props to director Louis Letterier, who found a way to frame and film puppets that\u2019s so revolutionary it might become a new industry standard.\n\nJames: Maybe it\u2019s just because of the way puppets are, and the way they have to navigate these sets, built several feet up off of the ground to hide the puppeteers underneath, but there was an intimacy to the way the show is shot that made you not just appreciate the artistry on hand \u2014 because it\u2019s so up close and in your face \u2014 but made it feel that much more real.\n\nIt was an interesting contrast to the movie, which is just jam-packed with sweeping, wide shots of Kira and Jen and the mystics and whatnot traversing Thra. While that was about a lens for the world of Thra itself, the way Age of Resistance is framed focuses it so tightly on the characters that populate it in a way that felt like a very deliberate point of comparison.\n\nI will say, if I had one tiny critique, I\u2019d hope a potential future season, which will no doubt be filled with more fighting now that the resistance has truly been formed, is that there\u2019s a little less shaky-cam in the action sequences. I get why it\u2019s done \u2014 you have to hide a little bit that these puppets are clashing swords with each other in a way that doesn\u2019t necessarily look like the most lavish fight scene in the world.\n\nYou\u2019re not gonna get the Daredevil hallway fight with a puppet (although I\u2019d not be surprised to see this immensely talented team prove me 100 per cent wrong!).\n\nBut the shaky-cam got so severe at points it felt less more like it was conveying a hectic feeling and more like obfuscating the puppetry. That\u2019s the closest I honestly have of a critique of the show, frankly. The bits where I couldn\u2019t see the puppets as well! Give me more lavish close-ups of latex fantasy creatures!!!\n\nBeth: That is going to be a challenge moving forward. As the resistance grows, so will the number of characters... and therefore, the number of puppets. And the type of conflict they\u2019re engaged in.\n\nThe scale is only going to increase from here on out \u2014 and if I have a worry about it getting another season, it\u2019s that it\u2019s already too big an endeavour for Netflix to agree to again. That said, I really want it to get another season... and given the glowing response, I feel it\u2019s possible. Where do you want to see the series go in the sophomore season? What stories are you most most looking forward to growing?\n\nJames: If Netflix don\u2019t give us more Gelfling goodness, well, then I need a dual glaive of my own to lead a resistance against them!\n\nI think going forward beyond the actual resisting itself, I\u2019m most interested in seeing two things: I want to see what they have planned for Hup because I think keeping him entwined with the Heretic and the Archer for the back half of the season was intentionally intriguing.\n\nAnd I want to see Deet\u2019s descent with the darkening explored because we get those very cool flash-forwards of her sitting on the throne in the castle, and Rian seemingly doing what Jen does at the climax of the movie, and I want to see all that unfold for myself. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a less in this instance: it was all so well done here that I just... want more. Give me more, please.\n\nBeth: I feel like some pieces are being laid out, giving hope that the situation in the movie was not the entire story and that some Gelfling survived the coming genocide.\n\nFor example, the alliance with the Arathim that have reclaimed the caves of Grot, or the fact that one Gelfling clan lives beyond the sands that they make sure to point out cannot be crossed. How would the Garthim reach them all? If the series does, in a sense, reinterpret or \u201cret-con\u201d the movie to have some Gelfling survive, how would you feel about that?\n\nJames: I think I\u2019d be fine with that, honestly. Not only does it give them more avenues to explore should there ever be more Dark Crystal beyond this (well, in the medium of TV or film, there\u2019s already been more thanks to the books and comics!), but I don\u2019t think having more survivors beyond Jen and Kira takes away from the desolation of the movie, or even the hopeful tone of this series \u2014 if anything, it gives them the chance to embolden that hope, if there\u2019s still some Gelfling out there after everything Jen and Kira ultimately go through. Thra\u2019s a big place, after all!\n\nBeth: Yeah, and incest (between Jen and Kira\u2019s possible kids) is so not cool.\n\nJames: Very glad we could clear that up. Gelfling incest: Bad. Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance: Good! Probably my favourite TV series of the year, frankly.\n\nBeth: Same. I didn\u2019t expect to love this show as much as I did or fall in love with the wider world it encompasses. I even talked with my dad about the show yesterday, and he is not a fantasy guy. I\u2019m so happy the show has been so well received, and that a lot of people are coming together to celebrate a great piece of art. One that I honestly think will have just as much an impact as the original movie, if not more so.\n\n\u201cmmmmMMMMMmmmmm. Chamberlain love praise.
