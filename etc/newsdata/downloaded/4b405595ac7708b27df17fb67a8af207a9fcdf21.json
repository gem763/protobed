That\u2019s my fiancee! You put me off \u2013 you should be ashamed!\u201d\n\nContrary to his image between the ropes, Hatton, the Ryder Cup player from Buckinghamshire, is actually one of the most laid-back and self-deprecating characters in the locker room.\n\n\u201cYeah, it was Emily,\u201d Hatton said with a wide smile. \u201cApparently, the toilet door was stiff. But it was right on my backswing \u2013 I\u2019ve told her the wedding is off!\u201d\n\nHatton went on to par on that 11th hole on his way to a 69 that took him to five under par, five off the pace set by fellow Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick. A former winner of the Italian Open, this is a big week for Hatton, 27, in Rome.", "description": "Tyrrell Hatton is known for his on-course temper and when he was forced to back off a shot during the second round of the Italian Open, observers feared for the miscreant who made the loud noise in the gallery, expecting the full Colin Montgomerie treatment.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212627815-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqGw_8_YqFn6oOhW46YSWn598bSlvSdSHXd93gbBfIbo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
