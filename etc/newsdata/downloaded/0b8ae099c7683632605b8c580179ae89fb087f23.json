Lately, the squad of across-the-board Trump defenders has dwindled down to people like Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida. Perhaps you remember Gaetz having argued that violence in America was not due to guns but to \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d This time he said that the impeachment process was \u201ca kangaroo court and chairman Schiff is acting like a malicious Captain Kangaroo.\u201d\n\nWell, you take whoever you can get and Trump does not currently have a lot of universally enthusiastic troops. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming called the American pullout from Syria a \u201ccatastrophic mistake.\u201d Any daughter of Dick Cheney is going to be a person who can overlook a whole lot. When you lose her, you\u2019re really down to \u2026 Matt Gaetz.\n\nAll this is going on while the White House is refusing to let Congress have access to administration officials who have information on the whistle-blower charges. Which, as of course you remember, stem from the time the man who believes he knows all about being careful on phone calls tried to get the Ukraine president to come up with some dirt on the foreign business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nThe man who later demanded that China investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings there. Even China found that loony, a high standard for a country that can\u2019t even manage to have a reasonable relationship with basketball teams.\n\nAnd, of course, the president whose daughter and son-in-law have both been working for the White House while raking in tens of millions of dollars from their business dealings. Some came from the clothing Ivanka manufactured in places like \u2026 China.\n\nWhy would he bring up children making money abroad? This isn\u2019t just a guy who makes stupid decisions. It\u2019s a guy who\u2019s off his rocker. Whose great pal is Rudy Giuliani, the talking head whose TV appearances can terrify toddlers. I\u2019m not saying Trump is the only unbalanced person in this story. Just that he\u2019s the only one who controls our nuclear weapons.", "description": "Getting stranger every day in every way.", "authors": ["Gail Collins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/09collinsWeb/09collinsWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
