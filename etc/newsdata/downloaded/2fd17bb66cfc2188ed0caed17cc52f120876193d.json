We were in agreement that the prime minister is on the run. Boris is broken. We have an opportunity to bring down Boris, to break Boris, and to bring down Brexit \u2013 and we must take that.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cOur intention is to be here, in this place, to hold him to account and to make sure that he abides by that law.\u201d\n\nThe brutal treatment of the Tory rebels, and the erratic behaviour of Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings, have provoked growing disquiet even in cabinet, with Michael Gove raising the question this week of whether they could be welcomed back into the party.\n\nGove, who as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster is in charge of accelerating no-deal planning, asked officials to leave the regular gathering of the key \u201cXO\u201d committee of ministers on Friday so they could air their concerns, one source told the Guardian \u2014 although allies insisted the meeting was routine.\n\nJohnson will fly back on Saturday morning from a visit to the Queen\u2019s summer residence of Balmoral with his partner Carrie Symonds to spend the weekend plotting his next move.\n\nThe passage of Hilary Benn\u2019s backbench bill means Johnson will be legally obliged to request an extension to article 50, if he has failed to pass a Brexit deal, or received MPs\u2019 approval to leave without a deal, by 19 October.\n\nSpeaking in Scotland on Friday, the prime minister insisted he would refuse to ask for any delay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a long time trying to sort of fudge this thing and I think the British public really want us to get out. They don\u2019t want more dither and delay,\u201d he said during a visit on Friday to a farm near Banchory, Aberdeenshire, at which he encountered a prize bull called Keene.\n\nAsked how he would secure a new deal at the EU summit on 17 October, he said: \u201cBy powers of persuasion. Because there\u2019s absolutely no doubt we should come out \u2026 It\u2019s a pointless delay.\u201d\n\nBut Gauke, one of the 21 Conservative rebels who lost their party whip this week for supporting the Benn bill, said Johnson would ultimately be left with little choice.\n\n\u201cDuring both the leadership election and subsequently, he has just boxed himself in, again and again and again. Just this week he is now saying there are no circumstances in which he will seek an extension. But if the law requires him to seek an extension, he either has to comply with the law, or resign. Surely he must comply with the law?\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Gauke also strongly criticised the Tory party\u2019s direction under Johnson.\n\nIf Johnson did resign, the Queen would be expected to ask Corbyn to try to form a majority government.\n\nThe Labour leader has mooted the idea of leading a short-term caretaker government, in order to extend article 50 and call a general election. But many members of the rebel alliance have concerns about backing a Corbyn-led administration, even for a short period.\n\nThere was further embarrassment after it emerged that Johnson referred to Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in a recent cabinet paper. The leak of an unredacted version of court documents to Sky News prompted condemnation of the prime minister for sexist insults.\n\nDuring his inaugural prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Johnson seemed to call Corbyn a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in relation to the Labour leader\u2019s refusal to back an immediate general election.\n\nThe other reference dates back to 16 August, appearing in a handwritten note about the idea of suspending parliament for five weeks.\n\nThe document was initially revealed on Thursday by Downing Street as it resisted legal challenges in Edinburgh and London to the prorogation of parliament, both of which cases were eventually won by No 10.\n\nIn Aberdeenshire on Friday, at the end of a bruising week, Johnson was asked twice whether he would sack his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, after the former prime minister, Sir John Major, described him as a \u201cpoison\u201d at the heart of government on Thursday night.\n\nJohnson did not answer the first question on his adviser\u2019s future but pressed a second time refused to give Cummings his unambiguous support. He answered: \u201cLook \u2026 advisers, as I think someone said in the Commons the other day, advisers advise and ministers decide.\u201d\n\nHe was also asked about his own future after a tumultuous week during which he suspended 21 Tory MPs, including the former chancellor Ken Clarke, his younger brother Jo Johnson stepped down from the government and as an MP, and other senior Tories announced their retirement. His brother cited irreconcilable conflicts between his family and the national interest.\n\nAsked about his failure to uphold his pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to unite the party, Johnson said he had promised to \u201cdeliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Asked again when he would resign, he said: \u201cEr \u2026 well \u2026 I think after those three objectives have been accomplished I will \u2026 At some point after those three objectives have been accomplished.\u201d\n\nWith a no-deal Brexit now all but impossible, Johnson will come under intense pressure to achieve the renegotiated deal with Brussels he has always said was his preferred option.\n\nTo encourage him to do so, a new cross-party group launched on Friday called \u201cMPs for a deal\u201d, including Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb, and former Conservative leadership contender Rory Stewart, who lost the party whip this week.\n\n\u201cEven at the eleventh hour it\u2019s not too late to agree a deal to ensure an orderly exit from the European Union,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cThe media focus has been on the short extension proposed by the Benn bill. However, we believe that Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the bill should be to ensure he secures a deal with the EU27.\u201d", "description": "PM\u2019s hopes of election by end of October recede as opposition leaders agree to reject demands", "authors": ["Heather Stewart", "Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d98a73c42755e62307d069c0697bc3859c5004c0/0_160_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8ada5ad0bf75830b7c5f89fba431ff8", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
