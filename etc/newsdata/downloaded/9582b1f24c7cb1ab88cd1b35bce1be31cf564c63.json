That's in addition to an ongoing legal battle over its role in the US opioid addiction crisis.\n\nEarlier this year, the company was ordered to pay $572m for its part in fuelling Oklahoma's opioid addiction crisis. It recently agreed to a $20.4m settlement with two counties in the US state of Ohio over claims it fuelled the crisis there.\n\nThe company's mounting legal bills have caused concern among some investors, but its earnings have remained strong.\n\nIn Risperdal lawsuit said Mr Murray developed breasts after his doctors began prescribing him the drug in 2003. A psychologist prescribed the drug after diagnosing him with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nRisperdal is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but doctors can legally prescribe medicine for any condition they see fit.\n\nThe company said it is confident the ruling will be overturned, and said the court prevented their legal team from presenting \"key evidence\" on the drug's labelling.\n\nJ&J is facing a series of complaints in state courts for failing to properly warn of Risperdal's side effects, including in Pennsylvania, California and Missouri.\n\nA jury in 2015 awarded Mr Murray $1.75m after finding the company was negligent in failing to warn consumers of the risks.\n\nA state appeals court upheld the verdict in last year, but reduced it to $680,000.", "description": "A US jury finds Johnson & Johnson guilty of negligence over an anti-psychotic drug.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C1BB/production/_109159594_gettyimages-1164571026.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
