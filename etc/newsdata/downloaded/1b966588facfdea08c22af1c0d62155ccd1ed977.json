Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) as \u201cliddle\u201d instead of \u201cliddle\u2019\u201d with an apostrophe as he wrote it. Trump, however, called the missing punctuation a \u201chyphen.\u201d In any case, it\u2019s mystifying what an apostrophe (or hyphen) would be doing in the made-up word \u201cliddle.\u201d\n\nA CNN spokesperson, stumped by Trump\u2019s apostrophe in \u201cliddle,\u201d quipped: \u201cIs liddle\u2019 possessive as in \u2018self-owned?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s supposed to mean \u201clittle.\u201d He may have been searching for the word \u201cli\u2019l\u201d as in \u201cLi\u2019l Abner.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that the dropped \u201chyphen\u201d in liddle on a CNN chyron during a news story demonstrated \u201chow dishonest the LameStream Media is.\u201d He also spelled \u201cdescribing\u201d as \u201cdiscribing.\u201d And he missed hyphens in \u201cnever ending\u201d and \u201clow ratings\u201d CNN.\n\nTo show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is, I used the word Liddle\u2019, not Liddle, in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2019\n\nThe Merriam-Webster Twitter site slyly mocked Trump with an entry about the difference between a hyphen and an apostrophe.\n\nFor those looking up punctuation early on a Friday morning:\n\n\n\nA hyphen is a mark - used to divide or to compound words.\n\nAn apostrophe is a mark ' used to indicate the omission of letters or figures. \u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) September 27, 2019\n\nTwitter wits had a range of barbs for Trump about his punctuation tirade.\n\nBy hyphen he means apostrophe. And by discribing he means describing. But I\u2019m stuck on the difference between liddle and liddle\u2019. Is liddle\u2019 possessive? As in \u201cself-owned?\u201d https://t.co/jJB5k5Srbb \u2014 Matt Dornic (@mdornic) September 27, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s really your stupidity that\u2019s hard to \u201cdiscribe.\u201d https://t.co/r96U7GLLgC \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) September 27, 2019\n\nDude - a \u201chyphen\u201d is the least of your problems. And btw, it\u2019s called an apostrophe. \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) September 27, 2019\n\nWe've talked about this, Sweetie'. That's not a hyphen, it's an apostrophe.\n\nIt's a funny word, right? Remember, I told you that you could call it a Sky Comma. You use it to repla...\n\n\n\nYou know what, you have a comprehension disorder.\n\nI feel like I'm not making a difference here pic.twitter.com/sIcgYeAOoP \u2014 KevinlyFather \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfc\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddff (@KevinlyFather) September 27, 2019\n\n1. Liddle' isn't a word. It's little\n\n\n\n2. It's not a hyphen. It's an apostrophe\n\n\n\n3. It's great to see that you're focusing on the right priorities \u2014 Edward Hardy (@EdwardTHardy) September 27, 2019\n\nYou\u2019re melting, snowflake.\n\n\n\nOr is that puddle from your crybaby tears? \u2014 Counterchekist (@counterchekist) September 27, 2019\n\nSir, it appears that the grammatical guidance you receive is not much better than the legal advice. In short, the words you are looking for are \u201capostrophe\u201d and \u201cI hereby resign the Office of President of the United States.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Taub (@jentaub) September 27, 2019\n\nTrump more upset that CNN misreported his nicknames than CNN reporting that Trump committed crimes. That tells you so much about Trump \u2014 (((DeanObeidallah))) (@DeanObeidallah) September 27, 2019\n\nSomeday, people are going to wonder what the last things Donald Trump did were in the days before he was impeached and they\u2019re going to find this tweet complaining about a hyphen that is actually an apostrophe. \u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) September 27, 2019\n\nAt least now you know why Trump never let you see his grades. Does anyone really believe the guy who wrote this tweet got a degree from Wharton without paying-off every teacher he had? P.S, there was no \u2018spell check\u2019 in the \u201860\u2019s. No way he took tests or wrote papers. \u2014 NoelCaslerComedy (@CaslerNoel) September 27, 2019", "description": "He called an apostrophe a hyphen.
