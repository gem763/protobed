Indeed that is one of the great beauties of running: simplicity.\n\nHowever, more often than not there will be other factors at play, such as temperature, weather conditions, terrain and distance. This is when you'll be needing additions or adaptations to these pieces of kit.\n\nThe following gear was all tried and tested over the course of many runs in all kinds of different environments and conditions.\n\nThe items in this roundup of course aren't exhaustive, however we see these as key bits of gear that'll keep you running in a wide range of scenarios.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

At five inches in length, they don\u2019t leave your thighs feeling too exposed, and with the brief they double up perfectly for bootcamp-style workouts as they maintain your modesty. With a handy zip pocket in the back for your keys and a couple of energy gels, you\u2019re perfectly set.\n\nBuy now\n\nOn Running cloud X: \u00a3130, On Running\n\nON is one of the world\u2019s most up-and-coming trainer brands, with shoes to suit all terrains and types of runners. The Cloud X is a lightweight running shoe ideally suited to road running up to mid-level distances. At 218g, it has a minimal feel on your foot, and its mid-level cushioning will ensure you don\u2019t run in a clumsy heel strike manner \u2013 you\u2019ll be a little more poised on your forefoot. These fit like a glove so you can place your feet with real precision.\n\nBuy now\n\nStance great plains crew: \u00a314.99, Stance\n\nThese from Stance are not only technically very capable running socks, they are also a bit of a style statement which we like. They also come in short (tab) and mid (quarter) lengths, but the crew versions pull up to your calf and are often adorned with fun designs. The height also helps keep any dust or small stones from working their way in. They feel great and comfortable for hours of running, the thicker section along the sole of the foot and lighter more breathable fabric on the top help with this.\n\nBuy now\n\nUnder Armour rush run short sleeve: \u00a355, Under Armour\n\nAs far as base layers go, Under Armour turn out some of the best. This running tee comes from its recently launched \u201crush\u201d line which features mineral-infused fabric that absorbs the energy omitted from your body and reflects it back into your muscles. Whether it does this or not is hard to say, but what we can say is it feels and fits great. It\u2019s quick drying and has an ideal near-skin fit, which is particularly good around the chest and shoulders.\n\nBuy now\n\nIffley Road waterproof gilet black: \u00a3135, Iffley Road\n\nConstructed from a lightweight triple-layer Italian softshell fabric, this is a highly waterproof, highly windproof and breathable gilet, and it\u2019s lightweight too, coming in at 125g. This British manufacturer turns out super premium runwear, and this gilet is no exception \u2013 it\u2019s built to last which you can feel the moment you put it on \u2013 it\u2019s machine washable, and looks great too. All its seams are taped which adds extra waterproofing, it has one good sized pocket placed centrally to the rear and is finished with a soft on-skin fabric round the neck and front zip. What\u2019s not to love?\n\nBuy now\n\nArc\u2019Teryx incendo SL jacket: \u00a3100, Arc\u2019Teryx\n\nIf you\u2019re heading out for an extended period or on more of a running adventure, having a windproof jacket tucked into a pocket or backpack is a must. This one from Arc\u2019Teryx weighs just 80g \u2013 so it\u2019s barely noticeable \u2013 and packs down into almost nothing. Windproof on the front and arms with a breathable and stretchy fabric under the arms and on the back panel mean it\u2019s a comfortable fit and you shouldn't sweat too badly in it.\n\nBuy now\n\nOn Running pants: \u00a3135, On Running\n\nA really well thought out design, these premium-feel, relaxed fitting joggers are ideal for running in cold or wet weather. On the front, the top half is a water repellent, plus it doesn\u2019t re-attach below the knee so they don\u2019t restrict your movement at all. The rest is made of a comfortable and stretchy polyester/elastane fabric. They fit snug around the ankle and have zips for ease of taking on and off, and the elasticated waistband sits comfortably in place.\n\nBuy now\n\nArc\u2019Teryx calvus: \u00a325, Arc\u2019Teryx\n\nThis moisture wicking cap is a go-to in all conditions. It fits really nicely and at 50g it\u2019s really lightweight so you\u2019ll very soon forget you\u2019re wearing it. Sometimes the peak of a cap can be too long \u2013 which is just annoying, plus can get blown off easily \u2013 or too short thereby not providing shade from the sun or rain, but we found the calvus to be the perfect length. It\u2019s finished with a water repellant finish and is breathable.\n\nBuy now\n\nBolle bolt: 85.99, RX Sport\n\nA no-nonsense, excellent pair of wrap around sunglasses, ideally suited to running but also good for all types of summer sports. They fit perfectly \u2013 helped by their adjustable nosepiece and having no gaps on the side \u2013 and the frame is made from great quality nylon which offers some flex too. They have interchangeable lenses so you can replace if damaged or switch for lower light alternatives (they don't come with additional lenses), plus a special treatment and coating on the outside of the lens means any grease, rain or dust will struggle to settle ensuring good visibility. These are polarised which is ideal around water and high glare too.\n\nBuy now\n\nMontane via jaws 10: \u00a395, Montane\n\nMontane has an extensive range of quality running packs, and with its 10l storage, this one sits bang in the middle in terms of its size and capacity. Weighing 350g, it\u2019s not an ultra lightweight option, but as it fits so well you really don\u2019t notice the weight of the pack itself.\n\nIt holds two 500ml soft flasks in the front pocket, and you can house a 2l hydration pack in the rear should you be heading for a long run. With a total of eight storage compartments, it\u2019s great for organising and quickly being able to find what you\u2019re looking for. With its stretchy sides, a stretchy Velcro strap on the front (plus smaller sternum strap), once you\u2019ve got it on, it feels really stable and comfortable.\n\nBuy now\n\nCamelbak ultra belt: \u00a339.99, Wiggle\n\nIf you feel a backpack is overkill for what you need, consider a belt \u2013 they\u2019re lightweight, convenient, pretty unnoticeable and cheaper. This superb one from Camelbak comes with a 500ml soft flask and a range of pockets \u2013 some expandable ones to stow extra gear and gels, and one large zip one to keep phone and keys safe \u2013 plus you can stow your poles onto the side of it which is handy. It comes in three different sizes, as this particular belt is one complete loop which fits snug and secure just above your waist.\n\nBuy now\n\nLeki micro trail vario: \u00a3194.95, Leki\n\nGiving you extra stability and power if you\u2019re taking on longer runs or on uneven terrain, poles are a great piece of kit. Here we have specialist German pole manufacturer Leki\u2019s latest flagship offer for trail running. Made entirely from carbon, they\u2019re lightweight yet strong with a nice amount of flex.

If you go for cheaper options in the Garmin range, there is a noticeable drop in quality and reliability, but the 235 excels, tracking all those essential stats such as distance, pace, time, heart rate, cadence and training zones. It\u2019s really lightweight too at 42g, which is great for those PBs as it sits relatively unnoticed on your wrist. Not unsurprisingly, the battery life is less than other heavier and more expensive options, but it\u2019s perfectly sufficient for a typical week of training runs.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeats powerbeats pro: \u00a3219, John Lewis & Partners\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best running headphones and have a generous budget, we found these to outclass all other options on every front. With a great battery life (advertised as nine hours, this might be a slight exaggeration), a super comfortable and secure fit combined with great sound quality, the only thing not to love about these headphones is the high price. Other great functionality includes an autoplay and pause when you remove or put the earphones in, and the ability to use either the right or left earpiece independently from one another and simple controls for volume and calls.\n\nBuy now\n\nBlack Diamond revolt: \u00a360, Black Diamond\n\nWe particularly like this lightweight head torch because of its excellent battery life, plus you can either charge it via a USB cable or pop in three regular AAA batteries, making it super versatile. It can throw out 300 lumens which is more than sufficient for lighting up any trail, and there\u2019s a multitude of settings including main beam (dimmable), strobe, and red night-vision. You can also lock it by holding the button for 10 seconds, plus it\u2019s waterproof up to 1.1m.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Men's running gear\n\nIf we had to pick just one item that we use over and over, run after run in all conditions, it would be the Columbia shorts. They just keep on giving even after many washes and months of hard wear \u2013 they're super comfortable, supportive and come at a very fair price too.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
