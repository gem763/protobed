The new deal will give S4 Capital access to Firewood\u2019s client base in the United States, including Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce and VMware.\n\nSmall- and medium-sized companies advertising on digital platforms for the first time are continuing to drive growth in the United States, where consumer spending chugs along at a steady pace.\n\nS4 has already won work from the likes of Procter & Gamble, Nestle, Coca-Cola and Sprint and had said it was being asked to bid for other major clients.", "description": "S4 Capital's content unit, MediaMonks, is set to merge with Silicon Valley's biggest independent agency, Firewood, as the Martin Sorrell advertising vehicle ramps up its digital push and raises funds to expand.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
