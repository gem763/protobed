Situated on a small peninsula on the west coast of New Zealand\u2019s biggest city, Ihum\u0101tao is next to Auckland airport, but locals, tourists and historians alike have tended to focus on the city\u2019s urban areas and its northern coastline. Despite, or perhaps because of, its long, complex and difficult history, Ihum\u0101tao has remained outside the consciousness of most New Zealanders.\n\nIn July however, Ihum\u0101tao hit national and international headlines when a group known as Soul (Save Our Unique Landscapes), which had been occupying land at Ihum\u0101tao for several years to protest against a planned major housing development, was served an eviction notice. The situation escalated quickly as police arrived to enforce the eviction, and thousands of people from around the country converged to support Soul. Many saw the stand-off as part of a global movement to assert Indigenous rights that includes protests at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, North Dakota and the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.\n\nNew Zealand: M\u0101ori king says disputed Ihum\u0101tao land should be returned Read more\n\nSoul, which comprises mana whenua (M\u0101ori with historic and territorial rights to the land) and members of the wider community, argues the development is not appropriate because of the historical and cultural significance of Ihum\u0101tao. Some tribal leaders, however, supported the development, having negotiated with developers to ensure they returned a portion of the land to mana whenua and set aside some of the planned houses for local M\u0101ori to purchase.\n\nThe government initially refused to get involved, backing the tribal leaders who supported the development. As the situation escalated, however, it realised that many local M\u0101ori, tribal leaders and members of the wider public did not support the development. The government decided to halt construction on the site until mana whenua had reached a collective decision on the best way forward. After weeks of discussions, mana whenua announced that they would like the land at Ihum\u0101tao returned to M\u0101ori ownership, and asked the government to work with developers to achieve this.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protestors gather at Ihum\u0101tao.

With the exception of a handful of insightful pieces by archaeologists, historians and Indigenous rights experts, there has been a dearth of information on the history of Ihum\u0101tao.\n\nYet Ihum\u0101tao is a place that every New Zealander should know. In a city that has destroyed or forgotten most of its past, fragments of Auckland\u2019s deep histories still survive here. It is one of the few places in Auckland where the long narratives of human history can be found in the landscape and in the stories of the descendants who still live there.\n\nNew Zealand was the final stop on the 65,000-year journey of the diaspora of modern humans across the world. Archaeologist David Veart explains the significance of places such as Ihum\u0101tao, where traces of the earliest inhabitants still remain: \u201cPeople in New Zealand often say we\u2019ve got no history \u2026 Well, what we\u2019re looking at is the end point of the exploration of the planet.\u201d\n\nMana whenua have ancestral links to Ihum\u0101tao that stretch back to the first people to arrive in T\u0101maki from East Polynesia. Archaeologists have estimated that M\u0101ori occupied the coastline from around 1450, and the lava fields at Ihum\u0101tao from the 1500s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Volcanic rock at Otuataua Stonefields. Photograph: Supplied\n\nEarly M\u0101ori gathered up the loose volcanic rock on the warm, fertile volcanic soils at Ihum\u0101tao to clear the land for cultivation. They built complex wall and drainage systems so that the tropical crops they brought with them from Polynesia, such as k\u016bmara (sweet potato) and taro, could survive. These systems once covered much of Auckland\u2019s 8,000 hectares of lava fields, but have almost all been destroyed by urban development. Today, only 200 hectares remain, half of which are located on the \u014ctuataua Stonefields historic reserve at Ihum\u0101tao.\n\nTribal connections with place were formed under as well as above the ground at Ihum\u0101tao. The dead were buried in lava caves, returned to the earth so that the past, present and future could continue to grow and bind together. At times these burials come to the surface, reminding people of the hidden histories that coexist with newer senses of place in layers across the landscape. In 2008, archaeologists uncovered and removed 88 k\u014diwi (human remains) during the Auckland airport northern runway development project.\n\nAs well as its deep history, Ihum\u0101tao offers very different perspectives on more recent history. After the British signed the Treaty of Waitangi with M\u0101ori tribal leaders in 1840, mana whenua invited governor Hobson to establish a government settlement on their land in Auckland. Most of the land surrounding Auckland was taken from M\u0101ori within a few years, but at Ihum\u0101tao mana whenua continued to occupy and cultivate their ancestral lands.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ihum\u0101tao mission station opposite Manukau Heads, 1855, from Auckland Libraries\u2019 heritage collections.

M\u0101ori helped run the station and school, and built some of the first houses and gardens for European settlers. In early colonial Auckland, Ihum\u0101tao was a mixed place, one forged by both existing tribal dynamics and the structures of the British empire.\n\nAs settler numbers increased, tribal leaders in the central North Island sought to protect M\u0101ori autonomy and resist further sales of their lands by electing a M\u0101ori king, a movement known as the k\u012bngitanga. After a series of meetings, one of which was held at Ihum\u0101tao, they selected the first M\u0101ori king in 1858.\n\nTensions continued to grow between the colonial government and the k\u012bngitanga, and in 1863, M\u0101ori at Ihum\u0101tao were ordered to take an oath of allegiance to Queen Victoria and give up their arms, or to leave Auckland and join their k\u012bngitanga relatives in the Waikato area. It was a hugely distressing moment for mana whenua, but most chose to support their relatives in the Waikato. This moment, which arguably marked the beginning of the Waikato war, the biggest campaign of the New Zealand wars, has been left out of most histories of Auckland.\n\nWill Jacinda come?

Mana whenua returned to a small reserve at Ihum\u0101tao, where their descendants continue to live today. When the Waitangi tribunal (a commission of enquiry established by the government to investigate M\u0101ori claims of breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi) investigated claims arising from the Waikato war, it found that the British invasion of the Waikato had been in direct violation of the treaty. Furthermore, it stated that the confiscations following the war had left an enduring mark on M\u0101ori. \u201cFor them\u201d, the tribunal report stated, \u201cit is as if the confiscations and dealings occurred yesterday.\u201d\n\nAs Auckland continues to expand, its new roads, runways, factories and houses threaten some of the oldest and richest histories in the land. These histories are alive and present for mana whenua at Ihum\u0101tao, but they should also be known by all New Zealanders. The recent decision to make New Zealand history compulsory in secondary schools is one step in the right direction. Ihum\u0101tao is not a remote site of marginal importance, but a place that should be central to all of us, if we are to understand different perspectives on our history; even those that don\u2019t fit comfortably or easily into the overriding European narratives that have been crafted about our nation\u2019s past.\n\n\u2022 Lucy Mackintosh is history curator at the Auckland War Memorial Museum | T\u0101maki Paenga Hira and has recently completed a PhD in history at the University of Auckland on Auckland\u2019s historic landscapes.
