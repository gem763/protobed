She said: \u201cIt seems highly unlikely that widely available nicotine containing vaping products, particularly of the type regulated in Europe, are causing these cases.\n\n\u201cAll the evidence to date suggests that illicit marijuana vaping products (THC oils) are the cause. In particular, a compound called tocopherol acetate may be the culprit.\n\n\u201cAuthorities who are reacting to these cases by advising no one to vape are by default sending the message to people who have quit smoking through vaping that they should return to tobacco ... which we know carries multiple risks to health.\u201d", "description": "A man in his 50s has become the ninth person to die of a vaping-related illness in the US.
