In fact, they think I should have passed some of the money on to them and I\u2019m regretting telling anyone now.\n\nI gave my brother some money to go on holiday with his family as they\u2019re on the breadline and have never been abroad, and I\u2019ve given my sons some money to do with what they please.\n\nSome other relatives have been bad-mouthing me and it\u2019s caused a rift in the family.\n\nI didn\u2019t win millions and I want to provide for my wife and myself in our old age, which seems reasonable, but I feel I have to justify my decisions.\n\nI\u2019ve been told certain people think I\u2019m mean and selfish.\n\nHave you got any advice?\n\nColeen says\n\nI honestly think you just have to ignore it. When the thorny issue of money rears its head, you really see people for who they are, and it can be a shock.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve had many letters from people aggrieved because they haven\u2019t been left anything in someone\u2019s will when they believe it\u2019s their right, and it can divide families.\n\nIf your relatives can\u2019t be pleased you can now have a lovely life free of \u00adfinancial stress after working so hard, it\u2019s their problem, not yours.\n\nIt\u2019s your money to do what you want with and you don\u2019t have to justify your decisions.\n\nYou deserve this and you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. It\u2019s kind you gave money to your sons and to your brother and his family, but what are you supposed to do, give it away so you\u2019re left worrying?\n\nI think jealousy is at the root of this \u2013 while money is fabulous, it can also be toxic. I don\u2019t think you should have to justify yourself to relatives but, if you want to shut it down, just tell them you didn\u2019t win enough to give it away to everyone. Enjoy your windfall.", "description": "\"I've struggled all my life without much money and now I have finally have some my family are bitter and bad-mouthing me\"", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531633.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mature-Couple-with-coins-no-savings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
