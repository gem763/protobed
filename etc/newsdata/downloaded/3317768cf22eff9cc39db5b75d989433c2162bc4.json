The breweries could charge those landlords more for their beer, and it would stay the same price in the pub for customers, he says.\n\nMr Bhattacharya said alcohol in supermarkets is cheap for a number of reasons.\n\nAlcohol duty has been cut in real terms every year since 2013, and beer duty in real terms is 18% lower than then.\n\nOne of the main reasons supermarket booze is cheaper than pubs is bargaining power, he says.\n\nSupermarkets can squeeze brewers on price because they are such large customers, but when it comes to landlords negotiating with brewers, \"the boot's on the other foot\", he said.\n\nSupermarkets can also use alcohol as a loss leader - that is, it's sold at a loss to attract shoppers into stores, where they will buy more profitable items.\n\nDuty of care\n\nKatherine Severi, IAS chief executive, said: \"Alcohol has become a lot more affordable, and cheaper too, by comparison with other goods... For too long, alcohol duty has been politicised.\"\n\nLandlords have a duty of care to people in their pubs, she said, adding that a change in the tax regime would \"reduce societal harms\".\n\nBrigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers, said: \"The focus should be on reducing the overall beer duty rate, which is one of the highest in the EU and places an enormous burden on pubs.\n\n\"It is also important that the report recognises that the excise duty regime should encourage the consumption of lower-strength products.\"\n\nA Treasury statement said: \"We are committed to supporting our pub industry and responsible drinkers, while tackling the sources of harmful drinking.\n\n\"That's why we've consistently cut or frozen alcohol duties, saving drinkers \u00a35.2bn, and introduced a new higher rate of tax for harmful high-strength ciders.\"", "description": "Alcohol should be more expensive in supermarkets compared with pubs, says think tank.", "authors": ["Tom Espiner", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1119B/production/_108634007_beer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
