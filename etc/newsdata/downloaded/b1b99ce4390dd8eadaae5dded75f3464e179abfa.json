He also had access to intelligence coming from our allies both domestically and internationally,\" said Lucki in a statement Monday, confirming reports Friday and over the weekend describing the work Ortis did.\n\n\"While these allegations, if proven true, are extremely unsettling, Canadians and our law enforcement partners can trust that our priority continues to be the integrity of the investigations and the safety and security of the public we serve.\"\n\nLucki pointed out that the investigation is still ongoing and said the case has \"shaken many people throughout the RCMP, particularly in federal policing.\"\n\n'Mitigation strategies' in place\n\n\"We are assessing the impacts of the alleged activities as information becomes available. We are aware of the potential risk to agency operations of our partners in Canada and abroad and we thank them for their continued collaboration,\" she said.\n\n\"We assure you that mitigation strategies are being put in place as required.\"\n\nFederal departments across government are also running in-house damage assessments to get a sense of the ramifications, according to sources speaking to CBC on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEven former government people in retirement are getting calls \u2014 meaning investigators are going back years to assess the damage.\n\nDiplomatic sources said members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance \u2014 the U.S., U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2014 are waiting for a formal damage assessment from the public safety minister's office, and some members are already questioning how Ortis was able to hoard information within the RCMP.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau was asked on the campaign trail how this case might affect Canada's international relationships.\n\n\"I think people will understand I can't make any public comments on this, but I can assure you this is something that the responsible authorities are engaged with at the highest levels, including with our allies,\" he said from Waterloo, Ont.\n\nOrtis, 47, is back in court later this week. He has worked at the RCMP since 2007.", "description": "RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki says the force is\u00a0still trying to understand the fallout of allegations\u00a0levelled against one of their top intelligence officials\u00a0and that RCMP officers are\u00a0\"shaken\" by the charges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4652548.1525730394!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rcmp-commissioner-20180507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
