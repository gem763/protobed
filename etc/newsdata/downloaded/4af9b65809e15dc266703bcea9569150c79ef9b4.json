Built by volunteers, it\u2019s 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the Kalasatama metro in Sompasaari, Helsinki. Free to use, it\u2019s open day and night all year round and kept spotless. There are no lockers, showers or staff, so it\u2019s real back to nature stuff. After enjoying the sauna, we went for a swim in the Gulf of Finland, then had a convivial barbecue with other visitors.\n\n\u2022 sompasauna.fi\n\nClare\n\nGeorgian splendour, Tbilisi\n\nThe old town of Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, has a great selection of traditional sulphur baths. Orbeliani is the most popular, and the beautiful facade of tiled mosaic is a landmark. Inside are private rooms that you can book by the hour. These include hot and cold pools, saunas and showers. You can also get a massage. Rooms cost from \u20ac14 an hour, depending on their size and comfort.\n\nJulia Barbosa\n\nUrban cool, Berlin\n\nClose to Potsdamer Platz, Liquidrom-Berlin is a fabulous crown-like space-age structure with various types of sauna (Himalayan, Japanese and Finnish). The floating pool with its underwater ambient music calms the soul immediately as well as helping you to feel really cool. We spent a wintry evening enjoying a break from the hubbub of the city, returning to Potsdamer Platz on the stroke of midnight, refuelled for the night ahead.\n\n\u2022 Two hours from \u20ac17.50, liquidrom-berlin.de\n\nSplundyBoy\n\nProfile Readers' tips competition: send a tip for a chance to win a \u00a3200 voucher Show Hide Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

On a bitterly cold February day, my girlfriend I and took a bus there wearing the snug woollen jumpers we had bought when we arrived in Iceland. We shivered between swimming in the big, warm pools and taking turns on the slide. We lay on our backs in the hot shallows while snow swirled in the wind. Friendly Icelanders chatted and laughed in the hot tubs. She agreed to marry me that day, and that place seems like a strange and lovely dream.\n\n\u2022 visitreykjavik.is/laugardalslaug\n\nRhys Davies\n\nGlorious mud, Turkey\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Sharon Cooper/Getty Images\n\n30 of the best spas in the UK Read more\n\nAnyone wanting the full Roman baths experience should take a boat trip up the Dalyan Bogazi river in southern Turkey and visit Sultaniye Kapl\u0131calar\u0131 on the southern shore of this vast tidal inlet. Here you can set free your inner hippo and wallow in one of the warm sulphuric mud pits before visiting the natural thermal spa room and then finally washing off in the open air pool or simply diving into the inlet itself. All that and a view to die for. Bliss.\n\n\u2022 Entry 70p, more as part of boat trip\n\nJustin Desyllas\n\nMaking hay, North Yorkshire\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Tony Bartholomew/Turnstone Media\n\nMy daughter and I visited the new Spa at the Alpamare complex in Scarborough. It was a bargain \u00a325 for a twilight session, which also includes entry to the rest of the complex. The staff were really welcoming and gave us a tour of all the facilities. The hay room was something I\u2019d never experienced before but was so relaxing, as you swing gently on suspended recliners amid scented hay from nearby pastures. We also loved the foam room, and the 90C sauna looking out to sea. A great find during our weekend away; we will definitely return.\n\n\u2022 alpamare.co.uk/spa\n\nSara\n\nThermal falls, Italy\n\nThe ancient hot sulphur springs at Cascate del Mulino in Saturnia, southern Tuscany, are the complete antithesis to a fancy modern spa, and all the better for it. The springs are in a stunning, wooded location amid beautiful hills near Grosseto, and, as you enter the water, there is a powerful sense of participating in a ritual that must have changed little since Roman times. Forget about pampering, but go there for a unique, communal experience. They\u2019re free of charge as well.\n\n\u2022 visittuscany.com\n\nChristine Keogh\n\nBrimstone bubbles, France\n\n20 of the best spas in Europe Read more\n\nThe hotel receptionist in Ax-les-Thermes in the Pyrenees handed us a discount voucher for Les Bains du Couloubret in the centre of town. What a discovery! Turkish meets Roman meets municipal baths in the most understated, relaxed atmosphere. Sulphurous, naturally heated waters take the form of swimming pools, whirlpools, waterfalls and spa baths. With inside and outside sections, the rooftop pool offers views of the mountains. A two-hour session costs \u20ac18.50. The memories remain for a very long time \u2013 as does the faintly sulphurous scent of your bathing attire.\n\n\u2022 bains-couloubret.com\n\nJosephine Winder\n\nSlides and steam, Lithuania\n\nAkvapark is a water park and hot spring resort in the spa town of Druskininkai, southern Lithuania. It offers swimming pools, slides, saunas of varying temperatures, steam rooms, outside jacuzzis which are great in winter, baths of healing mud and mineral water, massage rooms, relaxation rooms, and much more. This is all set in a picturesque landscape with forests and lakes. A double room at the spa costs from \u20ac80 a night, which includes use of the facilities.\n\n\u2022 akvapark.lt\n\nDavid Reilly\n\nVolcanic activity, Azores\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Rui Almeida/Getty Images\n\nAfter winding through the Azorean countryside (a strange mixture of volcanic and pastoral landscapes, with cows and tea and banana plantations), you reach the Dona Beija thermal pools in Furnas \u2013 four beautifully designed pools in a tropical garden. The volcanic islands supply the geothermal energy to heat the restorative spring water, and even though it was raining gently when we went, it couldn\u2019t take away from the magic of the place. We moved from pool to pool, slowly getting into the rhythm of the place, and followed the lead of locals by applying some of the clay to our bodies.\n\n\u2022 Adult \u20ac6, child \u20ac4, pocadonabeija.com\n\nFran\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
