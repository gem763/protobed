There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019", "description": "The president tried to insult the House speaker with a photo.
