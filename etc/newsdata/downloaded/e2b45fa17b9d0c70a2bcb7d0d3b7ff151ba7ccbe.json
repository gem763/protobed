The esteemed Sony-owned studio hasn\u2019t released a full title since 2016\u2019s bittersweet Uncharted 4, and its next game, while a sequel, is billed as the biggest, boldest, and most boundary-pushing game Naughty Dog has created to date.\n\nBased on first impressions, that certainly feels true, both in the look and feel of TLOU Part II and also in its promised narrative scope. Ahead of the roughly three-hour demo on Tuesday, creative director Neil Druckmann told us that if the first TLOU was about unconditional love and how far you would go to protect those you care about, then Part II is about how that love can also give way to extreme hate under unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\u2018The Last of Us Part II\u2019 will explore the nature of hate and revenge in a lawless post-apocalypse\n\nDruckmann\u2019s preamble set the tone for the first hands-on experience with TLOU Part II, one of the most anticipated gaming sequels in recent memory. The original game earned a unique level of reverence from players. It almost felt like a turning point for narrative-driven video games, carrying the emotional weight of a Hollywood film but on a gorgeous, big-budget canvas typically reserved only for the most successful, established franchises.\n\nI bought a PlayStation 3 near the end of the console\u2019s life cycle just to play the original game. And then I bought it again on PS4 when it was remastered. I remember the moments after I finished it in the fall of 2013 as my first brush with the then-burgeoning world of Let\u2019s Play\u2019s and YouTube reaction culture (including a viral video I stumbled on from an on-the-rise internet celebrity named PewDiePie) just so I could watch someone else\u2019s facial expressions as they experienced its polarizing final sequence.\n\nI suspect TLOU Part II will inspire similarly fervent adoration and divisive reactions, but for a different reason. This time around, it won\u2019t be about Joel\u2019s choices and what they said about him as a person and how justified he was in making them. It will be about the path of his surrogate daughter Ellie, and whether the now-19-year-old protagonist will sacrifice what makes her one of the most beloved and relatable video game characters in her quest for vengeance.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to Naughty Dog\u2019s superb writing and character growth that Ellie has emerged as the face of such a serious-minded, major studio series. On one hand, she\u2019s a hardened survivor trapped in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with an alarming body count behind her and a dark secret literally hiding on her skin (now covered by a tattoo designed by a former lover).\n\nOn the other hand, she is immensely relatable, as awkward and socially clumsy as any inexperienced teenager maneuvering relationships both romantic and otherwise. When Naughty Dog lead game designer Em Schatz told me on Tuesday that Ellie is \u201cone of the most complex characters in video games,\u201d I didn\u2019t bat an eye. It\u2019s true that Ellie will go down as a colossal figure in gaming\u2019s narrative pantheon.\n\n\u201cWe want our characters to be so familiar, so you say, \u2018I see myself in this person,\u2019\u201d Schatz says. She draws the distinction between Ellie and, say, Uncharted\u2019s Nathan Drake. \u201cNathan Drake is a superhero. But If the world collapsed, if there was an apocalypse, a lot of the things I see Ellie and Joel do, I can see myself in them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEllie is one of the most complex characters in video games.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s knowing what Ellie might eventually become \u2014 a ruthless, soulless killer \u2014 that might make TLOU Part II such a difficult game to play for the die-hard Ellie fans out there. We don\u2019t know too much about the sequel\u2019s plot, but my demo had a telling structure, and my conversation with Schatz illuminated some key themes the game will explore.\n\nI spent the first half traversing an abandoned, snowy town on patrol with Dina, Ellie\u2019s budding love interest. Something will inevitably happen to Dina \u2014 the latest trailer makes that clear \u2014 but we don\u2019t know what. It\u2019s that event that sends Ellie down the path I found her in during the second half of the demo: Ellie versus a band of unidentified killers who appear to stand between her and the revenge quest she embarks on.\n\nFor those who loved the original TLOU, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the sequel feels and plays the same. Naughty Dog has crafted a rich, deeply believable world full of intricate environments and tiny, scrutable details. I marveled at the handwriting on the left-behind notes on desks and in drawers and the intricate motions Ellie makes at the crafting stations when putting together a makeshift silencer for her pistol.\n\nI wandered through decaying motor homes and ranch-style houses and grocery stores that felt frozen in time. I listened to poignant stories of characters I\u2019m told I\u2019ll never meet but feel as if I\u2019ve known for years, told by way of ambient conversations Ellie partakes in as you make her dutifully raid shelves and cabinets for rubbing alcohol and bandages.\n\nThe quiet moments between Ellie and Dina were the most memorable, as Ellie\u2019s sarcastic quips and Dina\u2019s anecdotes about her incompatible ex-boyfriend slowly peel away the platonic cover of their relationship. In just 90 minutes or so, I could already feel myself developing a fondness for the two characters and their burgeoning romance, and it made escaping the infected in the survival horror sequences that followed alarmingly tense. When the teenage duo finds a deceased friend\u2019s basement marijuana stash and decides to light up to kill the time, I felt like I was watching a story as classic as any iconic coming-of-age film.\n\nEllie and Dina\u2019s romance forms the humane core of the game\u2019s vengeance narrative\n\nOf course, that kinder, more intimate setting eventually gave way to brutal violence. If traditional, Hollywood-inspired narrative is the core of TLOU, it\u2019s the human-on-human combat that provides the interactive meat to the experience. And it remains disturbing.\n\nThe second half of the demo was also about 90 minutes, but it centered on TLOU Part II\u2019s more open combat scenarios. Those now feel more dynamic, with a greater variety of weapons and ways to approach any one obstacle. Environments are larger, with multiple-story buildings that add a sense of verticality to the fights. It\u2019s something that didn\u2019t exist in the first game.\n\nThere\u2019s also added depth to stealth play. You can hide in tall grass, picking off enemies with a pistol outfitted with a DIY silencer or Ellie\u2019s trusty bow and arrow, the latter of which can be replenished with ammo so long as you lodge the arrow tip through a human skull so it can be easily removed. If you prefer a more destructive approach, you can lure enemies into explosive tripwire traps using the loud gunshot of a pistol or rifle against one unsuspecting foe to ensnare others.\n\nIt\u2019s here, in Ellie\u2019s deeply violent murder spree, that the game\u2019s character study seems anchored. Unlike Joel, who was already a vicious killer and who players watched redirect his loss of humanity toward protecting what became his only reason for living, Ellie is still an impressionable young adult. She\u2019s trying to find her way in a world that wants only to continuously take from her, and we as players are subjected to watching what that does to someone who still has much left to lose.\n\nTranslated to gameplay, the level of violence here is as uncomfortable, if not more so, now that you\u2019re embodying a teenager. I didn\u2019t feel necessarily great about striking a human enemy so hard with a crowbar that it shattered into pieces upon making contact with a woman\u2019s cheekbone. Nor did I very much like the half-dozen times I had to stab dogs in the tops of their heads to prevent them from chewing my face off (something that did, in fact, happen to me at least twice when my health fell low enough for the canine to deliver one of the game\u2019s graphic and signature finishers).\n\nEnemies react with more realistic emotion and intelligence, and combat feels more dynamic\n\nOther finishers include zombies ripping your neck out if they get too close and, if you manage to surprise a human foe, slow and guttural death by throat-cutting. In another particularly chilling twist, every human enemy now has a name; kill one, and their nearby companion will yell \u201cBill\u201d or \u201cDwayne\u201d or \u201cCarrie\u201d and become more agitated and aggressive. They will mourn their friends, and yet you have to kill them all the same.\n\nAs in the first title, this level of harrowing realism is on purpose. TLOU, more so than many other games, does at least seem to try to make a meaningful point about the nature of its violence and the messiness of forcing players to engage in it. TLOU is also set in a grim, lawless world where this type of behavior is supposed to set the tone. Yet early trailers for Part II \u2014 one, in particular, that featured a girl getting her arm permanently disfigured by a hammer \u2014 seemed to deliver a level of gratuitous carnage that left many wondering whether Naughty Dog was going too far or amping up the gruesomeness for shock value.\n\nIn my interview with Schatz, she says the game is designed to acknowledge how conflicted we feel about Ellie committing heinous acts, including blowing people up, bludgeoning them with sharp objects, and setting them on fire. At the same time, these tactics are often the most efficient and resource-conscious strategies at your disposal in a game where ammo is scarce and outright firefights often get you killed. They\u2019re also supposed to be cathartic in a sick way.\n\nYou\u2019re supposed to entertain the possibility that your opponents deserve this, that Ellie\u2019s revenge is justified, and that taking these people out by any means necessary is just the price she has to pay. Naughty Dog wants you to engage in acts of brutal violence and question it along the way. As a player, you have to ultimately decide whether it\u2019s more of an act of over-the-top glorification than thoughtful commentary, even if it does narratively tie into Ellie\u2019s dark downward spiral.\n\n\u201cWe want the player to be asking these moral questions all the time,\u201d Schatz says. \u201cWe don\u2019t depict violence and hate as a way of endorsing it. We want to present these as consequences in a world where there is no authority, no police you can go to, not really black-and-white, good guys and bad guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the player to be asking these moral questions all the time.\u201d\n\nBut again, Naughty Dog isn\u2019t as concerned with the right and wrong of the actions you as a player feel inclined to perform. Rather, it\u2019s about the way those actions reflect back on Ellie. She is not a stand-in for the player, like a voiceless RPG protagonist. She\u2019s a fully formed personality with a conscience on the line and a moral compass hanging in the balance. She is the story. Much of the uncomfortable nature of TLOU Part II seems to derive from having to guide Ellie through scenarios that see her shoot, stab, maim, and dismember the people who stand between her and the retribution she seeks.\n\nIn the end, she might not be the character so many of us have seen ourselves in. She\u2019ll be a different person, and, like Joel, the type of person Ellie becomes is squarely in Naughty Dog\u2019s court. It\u2019s the studio\u2019s story to tell, and it\u2019s not something we as players get to necessarily decide. But it is something we as the audience can choose to interpret how we see fit.\n\n\u201cWhen you need justice, how far are you willing to go for that?\u201d Schatz says of the game\u2019s central theme. \u201cAnd how much of yourself are you going to lose in the process?\u201d", "description": "The Last of Us Part II will launch on the PS4 on February 21st, 2020, and it features a darker, more intense world where players question heroine Ellie\u2019s descent into violence.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEDo806OAr1dNnnagExr6Lp_UCQ=/0x0:3840x2010/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19233918/TLOUPII_DEMO_SCREEN_10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
