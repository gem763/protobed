Democrats want to impeach Trump for leaning on the Ukrainians about the Biden\u2019s family\u2019s shady dealings \u2014 and they are shady \u2014 with that corrupt regime and its sycophants. Before that, they wanted to impeach Trump because favor-seekers book rooms in hotels with his name on them. Before that, they wanted to impeach him because of his Twitter habits. Etc.\n\nThe cynic in me guesses that the Ukrainian gambit serves a dual purpose: First: It provides a pretext for a pre-election impeachment inquiry against the incumbent president \u2014 which, given the current composition of the Senate, is unlikely to end in action before the election, or after that, either, unless there is a Democratic majority seated in the Senate. Second: The likely collateral damage to Joe Biden probably is not entirely unwelcome in some Democratic circles \u2014 he already is sliding vis-\u00e0-vis Senator Warren, and to many Democrats he already has the look of a likely loser should he be the nominee. If somebody has to be put on an ice floe, it\u2019s going to be Joe Biden.\n\nThere are many problems with this approach, one of which is this: Americans in possession of even a modest political memory must recall that not only did Democrats insist that the 2016 election was illegitimate, they also insisted that the last election that brought a Republican to the White House was illegitimate. There was talk of impeaching George W. Bush, too \u2014 talk that was endorsed by, among others, Donald Trump, who was a donor to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaigns before he became her tormentor. For the Democrats, there is only one kind of legitimate presidential election: one where they win.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nationalreview.Com Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry-Democrats-Refuse-To-Accept-Republican-Electoral-Victory"], "top_image": ""}
