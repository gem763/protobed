Senior Prosecutor, Ron Mncwabe\n\nMncwabe said Ramaphosa\u2019s mistake was to \u201cpick and choose\u201d which matters he will deal with first.\n\nHe is challenging the president\u2019s decision to revoke his appointment as head of prosecutions in the Northern Cape, which former president Jacob Zuma signed on the eve of his axing in February 2018.\n\nHe said Ramaphosa\u2019s legal activities with regard to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane\u2019s reports against Gordhan were initiated long after his application, made in April, adding that Ramaphosa had \u201celected to join as an interested party and support [Gordhan]\u201d.\n\n\u201cI verily confirm and place it on record that the three above mentioned applications were initiated from May 2019, well after this review application by myself was initiated in April 2019, yet these three applications have since received first preference \u2026 while this application of mine has been relegated as a matter of secondary importance\u201d.\n\nIn the application for condonation filed last month, the presidency\u2019s director-general, Cassius Lubisi \u2013 whose locus standi (right to bring an action to court) Mncwabe has also disputed \u2013 said delays in filing the answering affidavit were because of \u201cthe complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved\u201d, and therefore \u201cit took some time to arrange for consultation with counsel\u201d.\n\nOther reasons included preparations for the May 8 elections and consultations with Justice Minister Ronald Lamola, as well as similar applications by two other prosecutors whom Zuma had appointed at the same time as Mncwabe.\n\nThe other revoked appointments that were being challenged were those of the director of public prosecutions for Mpumalanga, Advocate Raymond Mathenjwa, and the special director of public prosecutions for the priority crimes litigation unit, Advocate Jacobus Pretorius.\n\nHowever, advocates Malini Govender and Bonnie Currie-Gamwo were not challenging the reversal of their appointments as director of public prosecutions for the Free State, and special director of public prosecutions for the sexual offences and community affairs unit, respectively.\n\nIn last week\u2019s papers, Mncwabe said the fact that Ramaphosa prioritised campaigning in the elections to be appointed as president showed \u201cclear contempt and disregard of the court\u2019s rules and practice directives with regard to time limits \u2026 and such cannot be condoned as doing so, without a doubt will be a firm foundation of a wrong precedence\u201d.\n\nREAD: Prosecutors take the fight to Cyril over reversal of Zuma appointments\n\nHe said there was also \u201cstill no explanation as to why [Ramaphosa], in his personal capacity, cannot or could not depose to the answering affidavit himself\u201d, instead of being represented by Lubisi.\n\nMncwabe said the constitutional provisions which Ramaphosa claimed to have used to revoke his appointment could not be delegated to Lubisi.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I strongly submit that, with there being no explanation whatsoever as to why [Ramaphosa], acting as such, has failed and/or neglected to depose to the answering affidavit himself, [Lubisi] lacks the necessary and requisite locus standi to depose to the answering affidavit on behalf of [Ramaphosa]\u201d.\n\nHe said that if the court agreed with him, it would follow that \u201cthere is no answering affidavit\u201d before court and his matter should proceed on an unopposed basis.\n\nMncwabe said some of the claims Lubisi put before court in defence of Ramaphosa\u2019s case were not supported by confirmatory affidavits and thus stood to be dismissed.\n\nThe High Court is yet to rule on the matter.", "description": "President Cyril Ramaphosa cannot make excuses that he could not find time to file his court papers, while in the same period he was involved in Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan\u2019s legal cases.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9413/6237132549de43b088ef3ef49731db82.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
