Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos that Moscow had \u201cthousands of emails\u201d damaging to 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a letter responding to Graham dated Wednesday, Ambassador Joe Hockey wrote that the Australian government \u201cis cooperating\u201d with Barr\u2019s inquiry and has \u201cbeen public about our willingness to cooperate.\u201d\n\nHockey added: \u201cIn your letter you made mention of the role of an Australian diplomat. We reject your characterisation of his role.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mueller\u2019s report, a foreign government official contacted the FBI in July 2016 about an encounter he had with Papadopoulos two months earlier, during which the then-Trump aide suggested the campaign \u201chad received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to\u201d Clinton.\n\nThat warning \u201cprompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities,\u201d Mueller wrote.\n\nPapadopoulos was sentenced in September 2018 to 14 days in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that Trump pushed Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a recent telephone call to help Barr gather information for the Justice Department's inquiry.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/52/d7920c4f42d8b90e49a547c37d13/191003-lindsey-graham-773.jpg"}
