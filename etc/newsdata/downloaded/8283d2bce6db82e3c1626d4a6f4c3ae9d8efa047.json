He is fully qualified as a lawyer in two international jurisdictions.\n\nThe US has apparently learned it can use its leverage over natural resources to pursue a geopolitical chess game which sees it heavily countering Russia\u2019s influence over the future of the energy markets.\n\nIf you look closely enough, the ulterior motives driving Washington\u2019s foreign policy agenda are readily apparent even in the mainstream media.\n\n\u201cOur great supply of natural gas is a boon for geopolitical leverage,\u201d Ellen Wald, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Center writes in the Hill. \u201cWe saw in the Middle East last week how energy production and distribution plays into geopolitics. With so much natural gas, we can work to counteract Russian leverage in Europe, we can supply allies and we can free ourselves of some unnecessary foreign entanglements.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia will eclipse American oil production by 2050 \u2013 US energy agency\n\nFor years, myself and like-minded individuals have attempted to highlight that US-led wars are almost solely driven by oil, natural gas, money, and geopolitics. For a while, we were labeled as conspiracy theorists, or terrorist sympathizers, or what have you, but following former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\u2019s comments that \u201cpeople say we\u2019re not fighting for oil. Of course we are,\u201d this mantra became a lot harder to maintain.\n\nEven Donald Trump openly suggested the US hadn\u2019t gone far enough in its bid to plunder and control the world\u2019s oil supply (twice).\n\nDespite these many admissions \u2013 and believe me, I could write an entire book on this topic \u2013 the issue is always framed by the mainstream media in different terms, particularly when it comes to foreign adversaries and the geopolitical significance of oil and natural gas.\n\n\u201cRussia Uses Its Oil Giant, Rosneft, as a Foreign Policy Tool\u201d claims the New York Times. In this article, the writer alleges that \u201cRussia is increasingly wielding oil as a geopolitical tool, spreading its influence around the world and challenging the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Washington & Warsaw make pact to obstruct Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline\n\nSo, if Russia is doing it, it\u2019s a big scandal worthy of a New York Times opinion piece. If the US is doing it \u2013 well, it turns out that the US isn\u2019t doing it enough, according to some writers. Western writers encourage the United States to do the very thing they are accusing \u2013 and denigrating \u2013 Russia for doing.\n\nBut no, it doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cBelarus Is Latest Target of Russian Use of Oil and Gas as Geopolitical Weapons,\u201d writes the Huffington Post.\n\nForeign Affairs goes to great lengths to explain \u201cRussia\u2019s Middle East Energy Diplomacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s Gas Web Ensnares Europe,\u201d Foreign Policy argues.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation details \u201cThe Russia-Venezuela Axis: Using Energy for Geopolitical Advantage.\u201d\n\nRussia is a \u201cglobal energy powerhouse that\u2019s much more than a petro-state,\u201d the Conversation explains.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s Latest Geopolitical Power Grab Is Going Unnoticed,\u201d claimed Oil Price last year.\n\nIt really isn\u2019t going unnoticed, given the amount of articles out there on this topic. But we really don\u2019t see this kind of analysis when it comes to the US and its ability and desire to exploit natural resources to achieve geostrategic outcomes. In fact, when the shoe is on the other foot, the headlines are wholly different.\n\n\u201cUS Natural Gas is the New, Global, Soft-Power Weapon,\u201d explained the National Interest earlier this year.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, lexical semantics matter. When it comes to the US, natural gas is a soft power weapon which it should weaponise. In the case of Russia, natural gas is being weaponized, and this should concern and worry us all. And no, I am not overstating this at all. Consider this paragraph from the aforementioned National Interest article, which reads:\n\n\u201cThe United States now uses natural gas converted to liquid natural gas (LNG) from shale deposits in states such as Texas, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania to transform geopolitics. Lower LNG prices stymie terrorist-financing budgets in Tehran and lower the ability for Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia to weaponize their energy assets for geopolitical adventures in Ukraine, Crimea, Syria, Central Asian and the Middle East.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Energy supernetwork: Putin approves Russia\u2019s new gas pipeline megaproject to China via Mongolia\n\nTo put it bluntly, corporate media are essentially saying the following: \u201cRussia weaponises energy resources for geopolitical adventures. The United States has a duty to weaponize energy resources in turn for its own geopolitical adventures.\u201d Seriously, the US can export Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to countries on Russia\u2019s border, such as Poland, but Russia should not be attempting to develop a natural gas pipeline with Germany (how scandalous by the way).\n\nAs much as Trump is a Russian asset (if you are still na\u00efve enough to believe that), this is one area that even he seeks to heavily disrupt and further alienate Russia over. As much as the US president has stated he wants to \u201cprotect\u201d Germany from Russia, I still feel as though Germany is old and wise enough to make these kinds of decisions for itself.\n\n\u201cThe United States simply cannot allow Russia to dominate Europe\u2019s energy future,\u201d said Ted Cruz, a sponsor of a bill implementing sanctions targeting firms that worked on the Russia-led pipeline project.\n\nSeriously, why even bother making the accusations against Russia in relation to the use of natural resources as a geopolitical tool to further one\u2019s agenda, when the US is notorious for doing just that? These accusations are meaningless when the accuser lives in a glass house, throwing tiny pebbles out into an open garden full of hypocrisy and double standards.\n\nAlso on rt.com US-Russia gas war drives European energy prices to 10-year low\n\nIn this sense, geopolitics is more than just a global chess game: it is a sports game. The teams are East v West, and we must pick a side. You are either with us or against us. Our failures to secure the transition of puppet governments in Syria and Iran, as well as our inability to maintain puppet governments in Iraq and Syria, mean that Russia will sooner or later start to fill the void. But \u2013 and correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2013 if Russia following a foreign policy agenda of its own is inherently bad, it would have to make that same foreign policy agenda of the United States equally bad.\n\nIn the case of the US, through official documents and leaked cables we actually know the foreign policy agenda and its relation to natural resources. We even know that powerful people support the use of extremist terror groups to achieve those ends. At no stage is this deemed scandalous or worthy of discussion.\n\nIf we\u2019re doing it, it\u2019s okay. If we suspect Russia is doing it, sound the alarm, and encourage the US to pursue an even greater geostrategic policy of weaponizing natural resources to counter and contain Russia.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
