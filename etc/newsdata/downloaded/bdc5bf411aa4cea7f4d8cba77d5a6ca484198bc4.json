(AP) - Kentucky coach Mark Stoops says quarterback Terry Wilson will miss the remainder of the season with a torn patellar tendon that will require surgery.\n\nWilson was injured late in the third quarter Saturday night on a horse-collar tackle by Eastern Michigan defensive lineman Turan Rush. He was carted off the field for observation and an MRI on Sunday revealed the tear. A release from the school did not state when Wilson would have surgery.\n\nStoops says he\u2019s \u201csorry\u201d for Wilson\u2019s injury in the release. He added that the junior QB \u201cdone so much for program the last two seasons, both in leadership and his production on the field.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s injury likely propels Troy junior transfer Sawyer Smith to starter for Saturday night\u2019s game against No. 9 Florida. Smith relieved Wilson and threw two touchdown passes to seal the 38-17 victory for Kentucky (2-0).\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kentucky coach Mark Stoops says quarterback Terry Wilson will miss the remainder of the season with a torn patellar tendon that will require surgery.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/e_michigan_kentucky_football_59829_c0-112-2688-1679_s1770x1032.jpg?300b650a821adb86d7726eefaeb05fa74b2722b2", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
