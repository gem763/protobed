But that belief is wrong, according to Matthew Ringgenberg, a finance professor at the University of Utah.\n\nThose who sell a stock short, of course, are betting that its price will decline. They sell shares that they have borrowed from a broker, hoping to be able to buy them back in the future at lower prices and repay the broker loan. The short-interest ratio reflects the total number of shares that have been sold short and have yet to be repurchased\u2014expressed as a ratio by dividing it by the total number of all shares outstanding.\n\nAt the end of August, Ringgenberg told Barron\u2019s, this ratio was more than 20% higher than where it stood as recently as the beginning of this year. This increase is \u201cone of the steepest\u201d since immediately before 2008, he said, when the ratio jumped nearly 40% over a similarly short period.\n\nLook Out Below Stocks in the S&P 1500 with the highest short interest. *Total number of shares sold short as percentage of float. Source: FactSet\n\nTo appreciate why the contrarians are wrong about the short-interest ratio, consider an index Ringgenberg and his co-researchers constructed that represents the extent to which any given month\u2019s short-selling ratio is above or below trend. They found that higher readings are bearish and lower readings bullish, which is directly the opposite of what the contrarians have heretofore assumed.\n\nIn fact, they found that, over the four decades ended in 2014, this index was \u201carguably the strongest known predictor of aggregate stock returns,\u201d outperforming any of a number of popular indicators used to forecast returns\u2014such as price/earnings or price/book ratios.\n\nWhy should short sellers collectively have this unique ability? After all, the stock market is notoriously difficult to predict, with most investors doing no better than random guesses.\n\nThe answer, according to Ringgenberg, is that short sellers must jump over a number of hurdles that other investors do not have to overcome. For example, it can be costly to borrow shares to sell them short, and for some stocks it can be difficult finding borrowable shares at any price. Furthermore, since the potential loss of a short sale is infinite, the practice is especially risky.\n\nThese hurdles discourage all but the most committed and confident of traders from ever selling short. That doesn\u2019t mean they will always be right. But it does mean that, on balance, their outlook on a stock is more likely to be correct than those who merely purchase stocks, according to Ringgenberg.\n\nRead more: Beyond Meat, Uber, and 8 More Stocks That Are Vulnerable to a Short Squeeze\n\nSo why did contrarians come to interpret the short-interest ratio in precisely the wrong way? Ringgenberg speculates that contrarians were swayed by the entirely plausible theory that a high level of short interest represents a large amount of future buying, since those shorts eventually will have to be covered. And it is true, he says, that \u201clots of short covering can lead to a positive price bump.\u201d\n\nThe key, however, is that this bump tends only to be temporary, Ringgenberg points out.\n\n\n\nEven though the short-interest ratio has spiked over the past several months, signaling that the more-often-than-not correct short sellers are anticipating lower prices, the ratio hasn\u2019t yet risen into the outright negative territory that would tempt some to sell everything and head for the hills. What\u2019s worrisome is not the absolute level of short-selling volume\u2014at least not yet\u2014but the trend.\n\nThe good news, according to Ringgenberg, is that \u201cshort sellers are not anticipating the kind of market downturn we saw in 2008.\u201d The bad news is that the \u201cdata does show some evidence of a possible downturn.\u201d\n\nConsider yourself warned.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to Barron\u2019s.
