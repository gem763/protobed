They are in 13th place in the 16-team league.\n\nAnderlecht have since named Frank Vercauteren, who has the necessary diploma, as head coach, saying he was replacing Davies, who stays on as an assistant coach.\n\nBut it has not cleared up who is actually in charge at the club. Anderlecht said Vercauteren would be \u201cin charge on matchdays,\u201d suggesting that former Manchester City captain Kompany was still in overall command.", "description": "Belgian giants Anderlecht were fined the maximum 5,000 euro (4,317.5 pounds) on Tuesday for allowing Vincent Kompany to coach their team without the required diploma, the Belgian football association said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441217017&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1T3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
