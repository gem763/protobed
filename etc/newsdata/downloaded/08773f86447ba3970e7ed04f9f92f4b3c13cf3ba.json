Though Biden also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, he had previously opposed denying same-sex couples benefits.\n\nHe backed same-sex marriage before former President Barack Obama, for whom he served. And shortly after his statement about Pence, Biden wrote on Twitter that there is \"nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights.\"\n\nForum attendees Elle Boeding, Micah McCutchen and Emmett Cory, all 20-something students at the University of Northern Iowa who are involved with the LGBTQ-group UNI Proud, said, though, that the event made them further doubt whether Biden was the best representative for a party that has rapidly evolved on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer issues.\n\nCory questioned Biden's response that he \"didn't have to evolve\" because he was an early supporter of gay rights.\n\n\"I think that he thinks he doesn't need to, but he does, he can't just ride (his political history) without having to get with the times,\" Cory said.\n\nBoeding was turned off by Biden at times interrupting Lenz, who tweeted that Biden \"said to me dryly, 'You're a real sweetheart,'\" as the two walked off stage.\n\n\"In this specific setting, interrupting a woman is a no go ... I don't know what it will take for him to connect the dots,\" Boeding said.\n\nMcCutchen said: \"Joe Biden had a bad night.\"\n\nBiden is set to attend additional campaign events in Iowa on Saturday, including a multi-candidate steak fry hosted by a county Democratic Party. His appearance at the LGBTQ forum came amid news reports that Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine's president to investigate Biden and Biden's son.", "description": "Biden's LGBTQ record draws scrutiny at Iowa presidential forum", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8K05O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
