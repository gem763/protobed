Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 member of GOP leadership, said of voters Wednesday. \u201cThey do not want to see their private health insurance taken away. They do not want to see illegal immigrants given free health care. They do not want to see the economy destroyed by the Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a risky bet for a party that continues to hemorrhage support in suburbs that serve as political cornerstones in swing states such as North Carolina, where Charlotte\u2019s suburban voters on Tuesday continued to break against Republicans.\n\nVoters in Mecklenburg County, a suburban stronghold, gave Democrat Dan McCready a margin of 12 percentage points over Republican Dan Bishop, bigger than the nine-point advantage McCready posted there during last year\u2019s invalidated race in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District.\n\nPelosi trying to run political playbook of first speakership under Trump rules\n\nBishop won the race based on running up the count in the more exurban and rural portions of the district in the south-central part of the state, continuing the geographical divide in the era of President Trump. That provided a sigh of relief for Republicans worried that defeat would have prompted even more retirement announcements.\n\nBut Democrats see the trend going deeply in their favor \u2014 in 2016, Republicans won this seat by more than 17 percentage points. \u201cThey needed to win it, they squeaked by. I don\u2019t think any Republican in the House, who\u2019s concerned about his or her electoral prospects, can feel better about the situation,\u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told reporters.\n\nDemocrats can still play offense in 2020, as at least 25 Republicans still in office won by less than 5 percentage points last year, including a handful who have already decided not to run again in 2020. History falls on the Democratic side, as the House majority has not changed hands during a presidential election year since 1952.\n\nRepublicans face a conundrum if they are going to try to win back the net gain of 19 seats they need to reclaim the majority. Many of those seats look more like the suburban portions of Mecklenberg County than they do Union County, a rural county along the state border that gave the GOP candidate 60 percent of its vote.\n\nThe party\u2019s current messaging focus \u2014 heavily reliant on disparaging Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), along with her \u201csquad\u201d of liberal freshmen \u2014 is resonating in rural areas that, for the most part, Republicans already hold.\n\nDemocrats went through a similar dilemma eight years ago, in their first months of being kicked into the minority after the GOP landslide of the 2010 midterm elections. In May 2011, Democrats won a special election in Upstate New York, taking a swing-seat district from Republicans with a singularly focused message.\n\nThen, Democrats hammered away at the proposal to create premium accounts for Medicare by Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), then the chairman of the House Budget Committee. They accused the GOP candidate of wanting to \u201cend Medicare as we know it,\u201d and in a district that had a large elderly population, it resonated.\n\nAfter their victory, Democrats promised to take that message all the way to the majority in the 2012 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt sends a clear message that will echo nationwide,\u201d said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), then the minority leader.\n\nBy August 2012, that message had fizzled. Ryan wasn\u2019t even politically toxic \u2014 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate. Their ticket lost, largely because of President Barack Obama\u2019s incumbency and not Ryan\u2019s budget proposals.\n\nRepublicans retained a healthy House majority, and by October 2015, Ryan became House speaker.\n\nPelosi outlines a path to victory for House Democrats in 2020 \u2014 and guarantees it\n\nThat May 2011 message, which Republicans called \u201cMediscare,\u201d worked briefly but did not hold up over the long haul, as GOP candidates over time learned how to counter the attacks or at least neutralize them.\n\nDemocrats who have some rural constituents have another 14 months to learn how to deflect the Republican attack line on socialism before they face voters again. Republicans have the time to figure out how to make that message connect with more suburban voters or find another message. Some GOP leaders say it will work.\n\n\u201cI think it is scaring an awful lot of folks in those swing districts, scaring a lot of moderate Democrats and energizing a lot of our folks,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested that there might be a narrow-enough path for his candidates to run entirely in sync with Trump during his reelection and eke out the House majority.\n\n\u201cThe seats that we have to go win are not so suburban,\u201d McCarthy told reporters, noting that there are 31 Democrats in districts that Trump won in 2016. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s going to carry them and more. And the difference is the Democrats now have a record.\u201d\n\nIn what McCarthy called the \u201cnew socialist Democrat Party,\u201d Pelosi has emerged as a \u201cmoderate\u201d compared with the more liberal faction.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve got real problems,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nIn that regard, GOP leaders today sound somewhat like Pelosi in May 2011. At a news conference two days after that Democratic victory, Pelosi used the word \u201cMedicare\u201d 22 times, and throughout that summer she stuck to that message.\n\nWhen asked how Democrats could win back the majority, she replied: \u201cMedicare, Medicare, Medicare.\u201d\n\nIt took several more election cycles for Democrats to pull together a message that connected with suburban voters and vaulted them into the majority.\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The Republican triumph in Tuesday\u2019s special election recalls a Democratic victory in 2011, which proved to be a false positive.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z77QMBGUZII6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
