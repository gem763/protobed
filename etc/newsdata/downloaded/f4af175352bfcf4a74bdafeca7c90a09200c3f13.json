Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign was the first to take issue with the policy, penning letters to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube demanding that they ban ads that contain false or misleading information. Those letters were prompted by false ads placed by the Trump campaign.\n\nTwitter bans political ads in yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if @twitter lifted the ban after 2020.\n\n\n\nStatement: pic.twitter.com/4ZdHGJw3js \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) October 30, 2019\n\nIn its statement, Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale alleged that Twitter\u2019s new political ads ban could hurt Republicans more than Democrats, harkening back to the party\u2019s baseless theory that conservative speech is censored more on social media.\n\n\u201cTwitter just walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars of potential revenue, a very dumb decision for their stockholders,\u201d Parscale said in a statement. \u201cWill Twitter also be stopping ads from biased liberal media outlets who will now run unchecked as they buy obvious political content meant to attack Republicans? This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s actual revenue from campaign advertising is significantly smaller than Parscale\u2019s figure, coming it at less than $1 million in recent cycles.\n\nDemocrats were broadly supportive of Twitter\u2019s decision, even urging Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg to follow suit.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg has said he doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of blocking false political ads,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said in a tweet. \u201cIf that\u2019s really the case, and not a desperate attempt to placate the far-right, Facebook should follow Twitter\u2019s lead and stop running political ads on its site altogether.\u201d", "description": "Twitter\u2019s move to ban all political ads comes after weeks of lawmakers berating Facebook over its own policy that allows politicians to lie in ads.
