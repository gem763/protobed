In fact, the NCAA rallied. An appellate court overturned Judge Claudia Wilken\u2019s ruling that schools should be permitted - though not required - to pay athletes up to $5,000 per year for the right to commercialize their names, images and likenesses.\n\nTurns out that was a pyrrhic victory. The decisions from O\u2019Bannon did not protect the NCAA from further attacks on its rules against athletes being paid for being athletes.\n\n\u201cThere was never a prohibition on that,\u201d Michael Hausfeld, who was the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the O\u2019Bannon case, told The Associated Press. \u201cThere was just silence. (The court) just said the schools can\u2019t pay. That\u2019s extremely important. But the endorsers can.\u201d\n\nLast week, California\u2019s governor signed into law a bill that prevents colleges and universities in the state from prohibiting its athletes from making money from things like endorsements or autograph signings. Politicians in other states, who have taken note of growing public support for college athletes being able to cash in on the billion-dollar business their work and talent makes possible, were quick to jump on board. In these divided times, politicians are reaching across the aisle to take down the NCAA.\n\nBy the end of the week, lawmakers in at least 10 more states had said they would follow California\u2019s lead - some more aggressively than others. California\u2019s law is set to take effect in 2023. A bill filed in Florida on Friday would go into effect next year if passed.\n\nThe NCAA earlier this year formed a working group, led by Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith and Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman, to come up with a way that athletes could be compensated for their names, images and likenesses.\n\n\u201cYou now see probably what in physics would be the most delayed reaction to an action,\u201d Hausfeld said.\n\nAckerman and Smith\u2019s group is scheduled to present a report later this month to the university presidents that make up the NCAA\u2019s Board of Governors.\n\n\u201cYou always want to be more proactive on any of these issues,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert told the Indianapolis Star last week. \u201cDo I wish it had been started 10 years ago? Sure, but the fact is we were not in a place where we could do it.\u201d\n\nIt is important to point out the NCAA is the schools. The rules are made and passed by school administrators and university presidents. Emmert does not have power to enact policy and there is not a cabal of bureaucrats in Indianapolis pulling the strings. The one time Emmert did try to get out in front of something was in 2011, when he pushed for a $2,000 a year cost-of-attendance stipend for athletes. Membership rebelled. Wilken later ruled the NCAA could not prohibit cost-of-attendance stipends, and now most schools are paying more than they would have under Emmert\u2019s plan.\n\nEmmert and others will point to other court cases working through the legal system as the reason why name, image and likeness could not be tackled sooner.\n\nBut forward-thinking leadership across the board in college sports is lacking, and it worries many athletic directors who don\u2019t see allowing athletes access to a free market as an unmanageable problem. The prospect of a wide receiver, point guard or midfielder becoming a social media influencer, starting a side business giving lessons in their sports or making $25 a pop for leaving fans personalized voice messages through companies such as Cameo is not keeping administrators up at night.\n\nThere will be challenges. Especially, as it relates to recruiting in the most high-profile sports. But athletic programs are already facing those challenges and it\u2019s possible a regulated free market could eat into a black market of payments to players that is near impossible for NCAA enforcement to disrupt.\n\nGetting an administrator to say any of this publicly these days is difficult. No one wants to be seen as putting forth a contradictory message, especially when the NCAA could find itself back in court trying to fend off numerous state laws.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the irony. You have an entity that has been found guilty of violating the antitrust laws, restraining interstate competition, then seeking to assert that the states are interfering with interstate competition that is already being restrained by the NCAA,\u201d Hausfeld said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understand that that argument is coming back at them.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA has spent nearly $150 million in legal fees over the last three years. The prospect of dropping another $50 million - give or take - on lawyers to solve a problem that has been looming for years seems like another example of the NCAA paying full price for day-old bagels.\n\nThe chances Smith and Ackerman deliver a solution that will satisfy lawmakers seem unlikely. More likely the group pulls something from the recycle bin.\n\nInstead of allowing athletes to access a free market and earn someone else\u2019s money, what administrators in college sports expect is a plan to give athletes money related to licensing agreements on things like apparel. The schools could essentially buy the name, image and likeness rights from athletes, build it into the cost of a scholarship and cover any Title IX equity issues by giving everyone the same cut. So, basically, something like Wilken prescribed.\n\nIt is hard to find fiscal sense in that. Instead of permitting the quarterback to make a five-figure deal with the local music hall to promote concerts on his Instagram, a school would be doling out thousands of dollars a year to athletes who would otherwise be lucky to earn more than beer money on their own.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to get around the market,\u201d Hausfeld said. \u201cThe market will determine what the athletes can make either as individuals or a group. But the NCAA shouldn\u2019t impose a restraint on them. It has nothing to do with amateurism. It has nothing to do with their educational abilities or obligations. It\u2019s a pure business decision.\u201d\n\n____\n\nFollow Ralph D.
