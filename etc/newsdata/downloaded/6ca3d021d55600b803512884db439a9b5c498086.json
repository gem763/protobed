When AUMs are being calculated, assets placed in the fund of fund products end up being counted twice \u2014 once for those products and again as part of each individual product under its umbrella.\n\nWhile investors may be unaware of the phenomenon, it\u2019s an open secret among professionals and researchers who told the Financial Post it is an industry convention to report AUMs this way. The result is that some ETF providers appear to be larger than they actually are, as does the industry as a whole.\n\nAccording to the National Bank of Canada, the Canadian ETF industry has a combined AUM of $188 billion when the reported AUMs of all the ETFs are added up. But when double counting is removed, that figure falls to $173 billion, a decrease of nearly eight per cent.\n\nAs for ETF flows, year-to-date as of the end of September, they\u2019re actually $14.2 billion instead of $15.6 billion, the bank said.\n\n\u201cDouble counting is a marketing tactic \u2014 it\u2019s a show of force,\u201d said Mark Noble, senior vice-president of ETF strategy at Horizons ETFs. \u201cThe money is going into those funds to show some sort of AUM and volume because, by and large, rightly or wrongly, usually the deciding factor on if (investors) buy an ETF in an asset class is whether it\u2019s the largest or not.\u201d\n\nHorizons, Noble said, does not remove double counting from its ETF AUMs. The firm has three asset allocation products that are comprised entirely of it own ETFs and an additional four that are made up of the ETFs of other providers, such as KraneShares and iShares.\n\nAccording to a Financial Post analysis, BMO Global Asset Management, the second-largest ETF provider in Canada, does not remove double counting either.\n\nOn its website, BMO, which has 19 ETF of ETF products, says that it had $59.3 billion in ETF assets under management as of the end of September.\n\nThe Post added the individual AUMs of each of the 118 ETFs that BMO has listed online, including the 19 ETF of ETF products, and calculated their combined worth to be $59.91 billion as of Oct. 7.\n\nAdjusted for the double counting of holdings in the 19 ETF of ETFs, BMO\u2019s total AUM dips to $52.93 billion, a decline of more than 11 per cent.\n\nThe Post provided its analysis to BMO, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVanguard, which ranks third in the ranking of ETF providers by AUM, has five asset allocation ETFs of ETFs, entirely made up of its own products. It also did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nThere\u2019s no real impetus to correct the numbers for double counting, Noble said, and there\u2019s a clear benefit to providers for releasing the AUM figures as they currently do.\n\nThere's no real impetus to correct the numbers for double counting, and there's a clear benefit to providers for releasing the AUM figures as they currently do. Mark Noble, senior V-P, ETF strategy, Horizons ETFs\n\nNoble said that he\u2019s seen new products accumulate hundreds of millions in AUM in weeks, only to dig into their holdings and find out that most of the flows are not coming from new investors, but from a provider\u2019s other ETFs or mutual funds.\n\nHe describes it as providers \u201ccannibalizing\u201d themselves.\n\nThe AUM question aside, ETFs of ETFs are gaining popularity among investors, who are seeing the the benefit of potentially holding thousands of securities instead of hundreds through a regular ETF. Some of the new products, such as BMO\u2019s and Vanguard\u2019s asset allocation ETFs, replicate an entire portfolio by holding sub-ETFs of equities and fixed income in weighting combinations that match conservative, balanced and growth mindsets.\n\nThe provider not only benefits from being able to introduce more of these new products to the market but is also able to make their existing ETFs \u2014 the ones that will be held within \u2014 larger and therefore more appealing.\n\nDaniel Straus, National Bank of Canada vice-president of ETFs and financial product research, said that externally double counting ETF AUMs is not illegal.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t appear to put investors at harm, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any impact to investor returns that come from this practice because the size of the assets in a fund complex only really matter to the managers and shareholders of that company rather than the investors in the trusts who are getting the return experience of the underlying holdings,\u201d Straus said.\n\nIn fact, it might benefit them. Many ETFs of ETFs are created for the purpose of giving investors a hedged option. BMO has done this with 11 of its products, creating an ETF of an ETF that mirrors an already existing BMO fund and simply hedges it to Canadian currency. Straus said when one of the two trades a lot and sees its liquidity boosted, the other will automatically follow.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any impact to investor returns that come from this practice Daniel Straus, vice-president, ETFs and financial product research, National Bank of Canada\n\nStraus, who publishes National Bank\u2019s ETF research, keeps track of double counting and has written about it in his reports, but when he publishes monthly updates on Canada\u2019s sector, he still uses the AUMs that are advertised by the providers. Strategic Insight, a research firm that also monitors the ETF industry also publishes research using numbers that haven\u2019t been adjusted to exclude double counting.\n\nBoth National Bank and Strategic Insight\u2019s research is also published by the Canadian ETFs Association on its online website. When reached by the Post, Canadian ETF Association executive director Pat Dunwoody said she uses these reports in the group\u2019s discussions with government officials about the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nDunwoody is well aware of double counting in both the mutual fund industry and the ETF industry, but did not know that the research used by CETFA did not account for this.\n\n\u201cMy assumption had been that they pulled out the double counting,\u201d Dunwoody said. \u201cWhat I will say from an association point of view is I want accurate information.\u201d\n\nAs the ETF industry continues to grow, Noble said he expects it will see a continued shift toward more ETF of ETFs products. The Canadian market already has 850 ETF products and there are few, he said, who can explain the difference between them. Selling bundles of ETFs under one product is just another way to make that process easier for investors.\n\nThat growth will likely lead to further confusion about double counting, he admits. Worse, it\u2019ll make it more difficult to determine if providers are actually raising new money from new investors or funnelling their own cash into their products. There\u2019s even the potential for triple counting to ensue, he said, if more mutual funds begin to hold ETFs of ETFs.\n\nAs for investors, they\u2019ll be left to wonder just how much the ETF industry is actually growing.", "description": "Fund values and the industry as a whole may not as big as they appear", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/abgettyimages-183458237.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
