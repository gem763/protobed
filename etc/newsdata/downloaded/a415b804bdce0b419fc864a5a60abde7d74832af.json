After causing catastrophic damage in the Bahamas, Dorian is now off the Florida coast and headed up the Atlantic seaboard. About 3 million people from Florida to North Carolina have been warned to evacuate.\n\nRead: Dorian\u2019s death toll rises to 20 in Bahamas, and expected to grow\n\nOn Sunday morning, as Dorian was still approaching the Bahamas and its potential U.S. landfall was unclear, Trump tweeted that, in addition to Florida, \u201cSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nHowever, Alabama did not lie within the storm\u2019s \u201ccone of uncertainty,\u201d and about 20 minutes after Trump\u2019s tweet the National Weather Service tweeted what was effectively a correction: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\u201d\n\nA NOAA spokesman told the Associated Press on Sunday: \u201cThe current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\u201d\n\nThen Wednesday, in an apparent effort to show Trump had been right all along, the White House released video of Trump showing reporters a NWS map of Dorian\u2019s projected path, dated Aug. 29, which he said was the \u201coriginal chart\u201d showing the hurricane headed toward Florida and potentially moving toward the Gulf Coast.\n\nBut in the map he used, Dorian\u2019s official projected path stops short of Alabama \u2014 though what appears to be a drawn-on second bubble does extend westward beyond Georgia and into Alabama. The second bubble, crudely drawn in black ink believed to have been from a Sharpie marker, was not part of the original NWS projection.\n\nWhen reporters asked Trump if the second bubble had been drawn on, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d and then, more quietly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted that unspecified \u201cother, better maps\u201d showed Alabama could have been impacted, potentially \u201cpretty hard.\u201d The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the National Weather Service, did not comment Wednesday, and has not publicly released any maps showing that.\n\nFollowing a number of critical media reports Wednesday afternoon, Trump tweeted an image of Dorian predictions that did include Alabama, and said he will \u201caccept the Fake News apologies\u201d:\n\nThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\nHowever, that map was dated Aug. 28, meaning its projections were long outdated by the time Trump tweeted Sunday. Furthermore, the map, which was taken from the South Florida Water Management District website, clearly states that National Hurricane Center information supersedes it. \u201cIf anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product,\u201d it reads.\n\nIf the map shown Wednesday was altered, it could actually be illegal. According to 18 U.S. Code 2074: \u201cWhoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.\u201d\n\nWrongly including Alabama in his warning had practical issues, too, including the potential for unnecessarily panicking residents and misallocating disaster resources, and lessening the public\u2019s trust in NWS forecasts.\n\nLikely coincidentally, shares of Newell Brands Inc. NWL, -4.03% , the company that owns the Sharpie brand, rose more than 4% on Wednesday.", "description": "In what appeared to be a bizarre attempt to justify a days-old tweet, President Donald Trump on Wednesday publicly displayed a doctored, nearly week-old...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ712_trumpm_ZG_20190904181037.jpg"}
