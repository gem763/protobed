But she still refused, and she fled with me and my other siblings.\u2019\n\nHellen\u2019s story is tragically common in Uganda.\n\nAccording to the country\u2019s Ministry of Education, 77% of primary school children and 82% of secondary school children experience sexual abuse.\n\nHellen with fellow rape survivor Maama Alice Nangobi, who is being supported by the Rape Hurts Foundation (RHF)\n\nSexual violence in Uganda During childhood, 35.3% of girls and 16.5% of boys in Uganda experience sexual abuse. For 25.0% of the girls and 25.3% of the boys who experienced sexual abuse in childhood the first incident of sexual abuse occurred at or before the age of 13 Most children who experienced childhood sexual abuse experienced multiple incidents in their life 40% of girls in Uganda are married before their 18th birthday and one in 10 is married before the age of 15. According to UNICEF, Uganda has the 16th highest prevalence rate of child marriage in the world and the tenth highest absolute number of child brides globally \u2013 787,000.\n\nThere is still a huge stigma surrounding rape in Uganda, with victims often blamed for being attacked, preventing them from coming forward.\n\nIn 2008, Hellen took the brave step of setting up a charity to help other survivors, the Rape Hurts Foundation (RHF), and said she is willing to \u2018die\u2019 fighting for her beliefs.\n\nHellen founded non-profit organisation Rape Hurts to help other sexual abuse survivors (Picture: Rape Hurts Foundation)\n\nThis group of women are learning savings and entrepreneurship skills at Rape Hurts Foundation Offices in Uganda (Picture: Hellen Tanyinga)\n\nShe said: \u2018I know rape hurts and I couldn\u2019t want any other woman or girl to go through what I went through. It affected my whole life, 25th July 1995 is still so fresh in my memory. I was raped 3 days to my birthday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was just 11 years old. It\u2019s that experience which gives me the courage to carry on and save lives.\n\n\u2018I am a voice for the voiceless in my community, I don\u2019t only speak out for the rights of women and girls or victims of Gender Based Violence, human trafficking and modern day slavery but also for the LGBTIQ, which causes me trouble sometimes.\n\n\u2018The men and even other women are not comfortable with my out spokeness, some men don\u2019t like me challenging the status quo.\n\n\u2018I have hundreds of rapists and women abusers in jail and they are not happy with me but it\u2019s a job I do with a lot of pride and am even willing to die for it.\u2019\n\nThe Rape Hurts Foundation (RHF) operates in Busoga, eastern Uganda.\n\nRHF are raising money to complete the construction of Tammy Morrison Women & Children\u2019s Hospital in eastern Uganda (Picture: Rape Hurts Foundation)\n\nThey have developed a forest plantation to help women become more financially independent (Picture: Hellen Tanyinga)\n\nLast year it won the prestigious Thomson Reuters Foundation Trustlaw Impact Award for its work on protecting women and children.\n\nAchievements made by RHF include opening a community school for over 400 children and developing a forest plantation to allow rape survivors to earn a living to reduce dependency on their husbands or partners.\n\nThe organisation are also building a hospital and safety shelter for victims of gender based violence (GBV) in Busoga.\n\nHellen said: \u2018Over the last 11 years since we opened our doors, I have seen some real change and impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Because of our awareness programs more women and girls are willing to report causes of sexual & gender based violence in the communities we have reached out to.\n\n\u2018In past, it was believed that if you are a young girl and boys or men don\u2019t touch your body as you walked on the streets then one isn\u2019t beautiful. Rape was considered normal and women or girls even hardly reported such to police or their parents. But times have changed.
