The veteran notched his sixth straight season with 30-plus saves and now has 298.\n\n\u201cEvery day just baby steps, keep working on my mechanics to make sure I stay sharp,\u201d said Jansen, who struggled mightily at times this season and even got booed in his own ballpark. \u201cThis is the best I felt all year.\u201d\n\nSeager\u2019s ground-rule double in the fifth was the Dodgers\u2018 first hit of the game and briefly gave them a 2-1 lead.\n\nHis double in the seventh was Seager\u2019s 41st of the season, a career high. His first double made Seager one of six Dodgers with two 40-plus double seasons and the first since Shawn Green in 2003.\n\n\u201cHe adds so much length to our lineup,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nThe Dodgers broke the game open in the seventh with five runs and five hits.\n\nPete Fairbanks (1-3) gave up Seager\u2019s RBI double in the inning. He walked Will Smith before rookie Gavin Lux singled up the middle to chase Fairbanks and make it 5-2.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to throw something that looks like a strike but isn\u2019t and he put a good swing on it,\u201d Fairbanks said of Seager\u2019s hit. \u201cDidn\u2019t execute it as well as I could have.\u201d\n\nA.J. Pollock followed with an RBI single off Cole Sulser before Cody Bellinger\u2019s RBI double extended the Dodgers\u2018 lead to 7-2.\n\nThe Rays answered with three runs in the eighth off Kenta Maeda (10-8), including a two-run homer by pinch-hitter Jes\u00fas Aguilar that left them trailing 7-5.\n\n\u201cWe put some pressure on them but obviously not enough and probably a little bit too late,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash said.\n\nTampa Bay had its lead for the second AL wild card cut to one-half game over Cleveland.\n\nSeager nearly had a homer in the eighth but left fielder Tommy Pham made a leaping grab near the wall to rob him.\n\nEach team ran through eight pitchers.\n\nJi-Man Choi hit a solo homer off Pedro Baez that tied the game 2-all in the sixth.\n\nThe Rays led 1-0 on Willy Adames\u2019 sacrifice fly to right field in the second. It scored Joey Wendle, who walked, stole second and took third on a balk by Caleb Ferguson.\n\nCaleb Ferguson made his second start for the Dodgers after being in the bullpen most of the season. The left-hander allowed one run and no hits in 1 2/3 innings. He struck out one and walked two. Ferguson replaced scheduled starter Ross Stripling, who pitched in relief, which will be his role in the postseason.\n\nTampa Bay\u2019s Blake Snell struck out four in two innings in his return from arthroscopic surgery on his left elbow July 25. Last year\u2019s AL Cy Young Award winner faced six batters.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have asked for much more from him,\u201d Cash said. \u201cYou always wonder, with not getting reps or that amount of reps, what\u2019s the command going to be? The power was tremendous, the fastball command was great.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRays: RHP Yonny Chirinos (right middle finger inflammation) could return as a starter or work out of the bullpen when he returns. Either way, he would likely only pitch a couple innings due to his lengthy absence. \u2026 INF Brandon Lowe (right shin, left quad) played in an instructional league game in Florida, but has hurdles to clear before he could return to the active roster.\n\nDodgers: LHP Rich Hill (left knee strain) threw a bullpen session. His knee has no structural damage and it\u2019s more about tolerating stress on his knee. \u2026 3B Justin Turner continues to improve from a sprained left ankle. He hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 7.\n\nVERDUGO WAITS\n\nOF Alex Verdugo (right oblique strain) has yet to be cleared for baseball activities, but hopes to return if the Dodgers reach the NL Championship Series. He said his oblique feels good, but his back is stiff and painful at times. It locked up on him while swinging in a rehab assignment at Ogden, Utah. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to play. I miss it a lot. I got to stay positive.\u201d Verdugo isn\u2019t sure if he will go to the team\u2019s spring training facility in Arizona to rehab. He was sidelined for his bobblehead night Tuesday. He called his likeness \u201cvery accurate.\u201d Verdugo saw an early rendering of it and asked if a neck chain could be added. He typically wears multiple jewel-encrusted necklaces, and the maker obliged.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRays: LHP Brendan McKay (2-4, 2.57 ERA) is 0-3 with a 6.50 ERA in his last five starts since Aug. 7. He\u2019s never faced the Dodgers and has made just one interleague start in his career.\n\nDodgers: RHP Tony Gonsolin (3-2, 2.83) gets the start after allowing one earned run and two hits in three innings of relief last week at Baltimore.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kenley Jansen has got his groove back with the playoffs nearing.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/rays_dodgers_baseball_44082_c0-122-2908-1817_s1770x1032.jpg?08e7d976eccad9e73daa87ead5bee43cd2e4723c", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
