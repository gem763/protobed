Play ball, he said. And play they did.\n\nGuess how the talking points went?\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren: \u201cImpeachment must go forward.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders: \u201cI think the House will find [Trump] worthy of impeachment.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden, former vice president: \u201cThis president is the most corrupt president in modern history, and I think in all of our history.\u201d\n\nGreat. Thanks guys. Now you there, Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 you\u2019ve called for Trump\u2019s impeachment numerous times in recent times. So how are you able to give him a fair hearing?\n\nWell, Coop \u2014 [I\u2019m]just being observant because he has committed crimes in public \u2026 [and] as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it,\u201d Harris said.\n\nSwing! Thank you, Sen. Harris.\n\nSen. Cory Booker? Can you be fair on impeachment \u2014 ostensibly, to the point of putting on a good show about that innocent until proven guilty thing?\n\nBoker: \u201cThis has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship. \u2026 We have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable. \u2026 This president has violated his [duty]. I will do mine\u201d\n\nGreat. Score another for impeachment.\n\nBut what of the possibility of distraction? Are Democrats getting distracted by impeachment calls?\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar: Rest assured, America. \u201cWe can do two things at once,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Julian Castro, ex-Housing and Urban secretary, said. \u201cWe can walk and chew gum at the same time.\u201d\n\nAnd as Mayor Pete Buttigieg chimed in from left field: Besides, what choice do we have?\n\n\u201cThe president has left the congress with no choice\u201d but to impeach, Buttigieg said.\n\nBatter up. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard approaches the plate.\n\n\u201cIf impeachment is driven by the hyper-partisan interest, it will only further divide nation,\u201d she said.\n\nGreat. Good points. Good, solid Republican talking points. No wonder Democrats don\u2019t want Gabbard on the stage. No wonder CNN reportedly hates her.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate here is more patriotic \u2026 than the criminal in the White House,\u201d chimed in millionaire businessman Tom Steyer, the guy who funded an Impeach Trump movement.\n\nAnd the crowd applauded. Back in the game.\n\n\u201cI support impeachment,\u201d businessman Andrew Yang said.\n\nAnd finally, Beto O\u2019Rourke. Beto, with the bouncing cadence, the bouncing rhythmic voice. The bouncing rhythmic voice that says nothing.\n\n\u201cI think about everyone who\u2019s ever served this country in uniform,\u201d O\u2019Rourke began. And then he went on: Whaw whaw whaw, whaw whaw, whaw whaw whaw whaw.\n\nLike Charlie Brown\u2019s teacher \u2014 only bouncier.\n\nWelcome to the fourth Democratic Party debate.\n\nWelcome to the best the Democrats have to offer.\n\nThe number one issue they bring to the table?\n\nImpeach Trump. It\u2019s the signature issue of the party; the signature issue of the Democrats\u2019 presidential trail.\n\nAnd after listening to the cream of the Democrat crop, one thing\u2019s becoming very clear: Team Trump doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to worry about. If Democrats, this far into primary season, are still campaigning first and foremost on impeachment, then the second term of Trump seems pretty secure.\n\nIt\u2019s swing and miss for the Dems, all the way home.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
