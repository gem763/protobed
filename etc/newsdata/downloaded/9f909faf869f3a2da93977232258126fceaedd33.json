He is shown in a still from a video released in April, having not been seen since he spoke at the Grand Mosque in Mosul in 2014\n\nAn aerial view of the site taken today shows the helicopter\n\nThis was the moment they had been planning for since a lucky break in Iraq last month.\n\nIraqi-Kurdish officials had detained one of Baghdadi's many wives, a nephew and the wife of one of his trusted couriers.\n\nThe information from that trio led them, it is understood, to an IS hideout in the desert of western Iraq, a bolthole that was to prove extremely valuable.\n\nFor found inside, among some of the IS leader's personal possessions, were the coordinates of his secret location, a non-descript house in a part of northwest Syria that was controlled by Al Qaeda, an enemy of Baghdadi.\n\nEven for the organisation that murdered more than 3,000 in 9/11, the brutal violence of Islamic State was too much and Baghdadi was seen as unhinged.\n\nWith the CIA now on board, the mission to take out Baghdadi had suddenly grown even more dangerous.\n\nTrump looks on\n\nWhen Mr Trump arrived on Saturday to watch the operation in real-time, it came four days after he had given the green light, with several other opportunities aborted at the last minute.\n\nMoments after he was in place, at around 9pm UK time, the US helicopters lifted off from their air base in Iraq and flew some 500 miles over 'very very dangerous territory', a journey that lasted just over an hour.\n\nDonald Trump addressed the nation Sunday morning, confirming that the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He said he had watched and monitored the whole operation Saturday night\n\nThe teams had to cross Russian, Syrian and Turkish airspace to reach their objective. With current tensions in the region, they could easily have been mistaken for an invading force.\n\nUS commanders notified Moscow, Damascus and Ankara that something 'big' that they 'would like' was going to happen \u2013 but they did not share their ultimate goal.\n\nAs the helicopters, a mix of Chinooks and Black Hawks, approached the compound in the war-ravaged Idlib province, near the Turkish border, all hell broke loose.\n\nMeeting in the situation room Saturday night (from left to right): National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark Milley and Brig. General Marcus Evans\n\nTroops storm in\n\nFearing a booby-trapped front door, the elite soldiers made their own opening, blowing holes into the wall of Baghdadi's den. Two 'wives', both wearing suicide vests which thankfully did not detonate, were killed in the ensuing firefight, along with a large number of Baghdadi's 'fighters and companions'.\n\nISIS 'already has a new leader' barely a day after former chief Baghdadi 'died like a dog' in US strikes as former Saddam Hussein army officer takes terror group's reins ISIS 'already has a new leader' barely a day after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi who died 'like a dog' in US strikes as a former Saddam Hussein army officer takes the terror group's reins. Abdullah Qardash - sometimes spelt Karshesh - was said to have been nominated by the now deceased al-Baghdadi to run the group's 'Muslim Affairs', as reported by Newsweek. Little is known about Qardash, who once served under Saddam Hussein. But he is understood to have already taken over a number of duties from al-Baghdadi prior to his demise this week when he detonated a suicide vest. An official told Newsweek: 'Baghdadi was a figurehead. He was not involved in operations or day-to-day,' the official told 'All Baghdadi did was say yes or no\u2014no planning.'\n\nAs they cleared the building carefully, tracking room by room in the darkness, an Arabic speaker called out, urging Baghdadi to give himself up.\n\nBut the terrorist who called for death to the West ran, drawing Delta Force deeper into the compound they had studied from plans \u2013 memorising every corner, every hiding place and every possible escape route.\n\nAs the team went further, they helped 11 children get out alive, while a group of Islamic State extremists, realising their time was up, surrendered. Mr Trump said there 'more dead than alive' in the aftermath.\n\nOnce the compound had been emptied of others, the US troops and their dogs chased Baghdadi into an underground tunnel, taking three children with him.\n\nThe soldiers knew it was a dead end and there was no escape, so proceeded slowly, sending in their highly-trained canines.\n\nTarget down\n\nIt was at that point that Baghdadi's murderous reign came to an end as he detonated his own suicide vest, killing himself, his terrified young hostages and bringing much of the tunnel down upon them.\n\nAnnouncing the news yesterday, Mr Trump said: 'The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.'\n\nBack in the White House, having been informed of the explosion, they held their breath. Back in the tunnel, the US team dug through the rubble.\n\nNot much of Baghdadi was left \u2013 but enough for a DNA test using a small field kit.\n\nWithin 15 minutes, news crackled through to the Situation Room on the radio: '100 per cent confidence Jackpot. Over.'\n\nJackpot is thought to be the codename the US gave to Baghdadi, the same name they had given to Osama Bin Laden during a similar operation in 2011.\n\nThe overall Bin Laden operation was given the classified name 'Operation Neptune Spear', a reference to the trident in the insignia of SEAL Team Six who went after the terrorist.\n\nThis time, the mission for Baghdadi was given a more human touch, named after US human rights worker Kayla Mueller, who was captured by IS and, according to the US, made a personal prisoner of its leader before she was killed.\n\nWith Baghdadi confirmed dead, and the opposition outside 'obliterated' in the president's words, Delta Force made their way out but not before 'exploiting' the scene, a military term for intelligence gathering on the go.\n\nHideout blitzed\n\nThey grabbed every computer, every phone, every bit of paper they could find in the hope it will bring them closer to tracking those still loyal to IS and putting an end to them once and for all. Two hours after they touched down, the team was back in the air, being whisked to safety, heading out of Syria along the same path they had taken to get in.\n\nThe last action was to call in an airstrike by US drones, reducing Baghdadi's hideout to rubble, wiping it from the face of the Earth and covering their tracks.\n\nWhen he had word his units were back safe and sound, not a casualty among them, Donald Trump fired up his Twitter to tease the world with a cryptic message: 'Something very big has just happened!'\n\nHe then stayed silent until breaking the news yesterday morning, telling reporters: 'Last night, the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice.'\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning. His lair was in a village known for smuggling, and he arrived there 48 hours before the raid\n\nDeath of a butcher, but not of his cause: JOHN R. BRADLEY examines the likely impact of the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\n\nHe may have been the world's most wanted terrorist and the supremo of global jihad, but Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was all but a mythical figure to those hunting him.\n\nKnown as 'The Invisible Sheikh' \u2013 by virtue of the mask he wore to address his commanders \u2013 he nurtured the lowest of profiles, eschewing the showmanship of fellow jihadi leaders who paid the price by making themselves vulnerable to tracking by intelligence services.\n\nIndeed, he made only two video appearances during his lifetime \u2013 until yesterday, that is, when US Special Forces apparently recorded him blowing himself up in northwestern Syria.\n\nFor five years, Al-Baghdadi \u2013 a nom de guerre, his real name was Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri \u2013 led the most barbaric terrorist outfit the modern world has known.\n\nHe came to global attention in 2014 when a YouTube video showed him in the pulpit of the Nouri mosque in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, which his IS foot- soldiers had just conquered.\n\nDressed in a black turban and flowing black gown, he delivered a sermon urging Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the new caliphate \u2013 an Islamic state led by a caliph, a successor to the Prophet Muhammad who has absolute political and religious power \u2013 and to flock to protect its newly conquered territory.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's Iraqi tribe claimed descent from the Prophet, but few had heard of him before he brazenly declared himself ruler of all Muslims.\n\nBorn in 1971 to a middle-class family in the Iraqi city of Samarra, Al-Baghdadi always saw his destiny as an important religious leader. As a youth he was a keen footballer, but known for his piety. His family nickname was 'the Believer' because he'd scold those who failed to observe religious practices correctly.\n\nHe moved to Baghdad to study, graduating in Koranic studies and then teaching at a mosque. But when the US invaded Iraq in 2003, he joined the violent insurrection. A year later, US forces arrested him in Fallujah, but he was considered a low-level threat and incarcerated for only ten months.\n\nCrucially, however, he spent time in the hellish Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca \u2013 known as the Jihad University \u2013 detention facilities where he befriended battle-hardened jihadis.\n\nFollowing his release, Al-Baghdadi joined the Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda which later became Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nIn 2010, he re-emerged as its leader, and his fighters crossed into Syria to take advantage of the chaos caused by the civil war. Islamic State in Iraq thus morphed into Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \u2013 and ISIL (later IS) was born.\n\nBy 2015, this ruthless battlefield tactician was ruling over a caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq that was the size of Britain, with almost 8 million people under his control, and an annual budget of more than $1billion \u2013 generated through the sale of oil from the facilities IS controlled, but also from extortion and kidnapping.\n\nHis fanatical militia, who flocked to the caliphate from all over the world, numbered at least 30,000, although some estimates put their number at the caliphate's peak as at least double or even treble that.\n\nDuring its reign of terror, IS carried out unspeakable acts of barbarity in the name of a perverted holy war. Its ultimate, apocalyptic goal was to rid the world of anyone \u2013 Muslim and non-Muslim alike \u2013 who refused to submit to its extremist interpretation of Islam.\n\nThousands of innocents were lined up on their knees and ritually slaughtered by having their throats slit. As 'infidels', Christians, Yazidis and Shia Muslims were singled out for slaughter, the ghastly spectacle was recorded in sickeningly\n\nprofessional propaganda videos that shocked the world.\n\nIS relished its reputation for brutality to Western hostages in particular, including Britons David Haines, an aid worker, and Alan Henning, a Salford taxi driver who had gone to Syria to help deliver aid. Countless others were burned or buried alive, or drowned, while suspected homosexuals were thrown from the top of buildings, and thousands of women and girls were taken as sex slaves.\n\nIn Iraq, more than 200 mass graves containing IS victims have been found containing between 6,000 and 12,000 bodies. Still more mass graves continue to be discovered in Syria.\n\nAt the same time, IS terrorists have carried out dozens of attacks around the world, killing and maiming thousands.\n\nNo wonder Donald Trump was triumphant yesterday \u2013 'he died like a dog' \u2013 as he announced Al-Baghdadi's death. There have been numerous false reports of his death since the defeat of IS in 2017, but the President has a particular reason to be thrilled.\n\nTrump is facing stinging criticism domestically and internationally that his partial withdrawal of US troops in Syria this month has left the Kurds \u2013 America's allies in the fight against IS \u2013 exposed and created a vacuum which might allow IS to re-emerge.\n\nThe group still has thousands of armed supporters in the area. IS sleeper cells have already launched several attacks.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's death will bolster Trump's claim that under his watch IS will not be allowed to regain strength and threaten American interests. But the President would be foolish to be too optimistic. The parallels between the US raids that killed Al-Baghdadi and that which killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 are striking \u2013 and ominous.\n\nMany terrorism experts argue that Al Qaeda is an even more dangerous enemy today, with thousands of battle-hardened members in South Asia, Africa and the West. Meanwhile, Islamic State is active in at least 18 countries, claiming to have carried out more than 1,800 attacks in the first half of this year alone. Al-Baghdadi is gone and the dream of the caliphate is over \u2013 but his death has not dealt a fatal blow.\n\nJohn R Bradley is the author of After the Arab Spring: How Islamists Hijacked the Middle East Revolts", "description": "Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died 'like a dog and a coward' in a daring raid by US forces under the cover of darkness in in Idlib, Syria.
