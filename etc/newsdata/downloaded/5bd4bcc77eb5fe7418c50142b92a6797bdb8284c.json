We need to address this challenge by raising awareness and boosting investment in research and monitoring.\u201d\n\nThe release reported about 12 million Americans suffer from these diseases that have been designated as \u201cneglected,\u201d usually in places with unsafe drinking water and subpar housing, sanitation and sewage systems. The press release added that because many believe these diseases have been eradicated in the country, they have not been tracked or reported sufficiently.\n\nThe legislation specifically will set up a task force to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to prevent, diagnose and treat these diseases. It would also administer resources to states to allow them to track the prevalence of these illnesses, mandate the Health and Human Services Department to develop educational programs about the diseases and promote research to find affordable tools and treatment, according to the release.\n\nBooker has made poverty a central focus in his presidential campaign.\n\nEarlier this month he released a plan to cut child poverty saying the U.S. has \u201ca moral responsibility to look after each other and make sure that every child living in America has the opportunity to grow and thrive.\u201d\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, Booker is currently in 8th place in the crowded Democratic primary field.", "description": "Sen.
