China launches a five-year economic plan, the \"Great Leap Forward\", collectivising farming and investing in heavy industry. The plan is abandoned after two years after poor harvests lead to starvation and millions of deaths. The 10-year \"Cultural Revolution\" causes economic and political upheaval, as Mao attempts to purge communist China of remaining capitalist and traditional elements of society, and enforce Maoism as the dominant and permanent ideology. Chairman Mao dies. China's \"one-child policy\" is introduced to curb population growth. Troops fire on protesters in Tianaman Square who had been campaigning for greater freedom and democracy. The uprising is crushed. The opening of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges symbolise the increasing economic liberalisation of China. Control of Hong Kong is handed back to China from the UK. Two years later Portugal transfers the sovereignty of Macau back to the Chinese. China joins the World Trade Organization. Yang Liwei becomes the first Chinese astronaut. Within 10 years the country will successfully deploy a robot rover on the moon. After years of tension, including riots over how Japanese schoolbooks are accused of portraying the events of the second world war, and tensions over territorial claims in the South China Sea, Wen Jiabao becomes the first Chinese prime minister to address Japan's parliament. Beijing hosts the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. China overtakes Germany as the world's biggest exporter of goods. The following year it becomes the world's second-largest economy, over-taking Japan. The Chinese economic \"miracle\" falters, as growth falls to its lowest level for 25 years. China becomes increasingly embroiled in a trade war with the US. A series of major pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong challenge Chinese rule there. The country's human rights record also comes under scrutiny for its treatment of the Uighurs, with claims that more than 1 million of them have been detained in camps the Chinese have euphemistically called \u201cvocational education centres\u201d.\n\nBut the major headache is Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protesters plan to grab the spotlight from Beijing on Tuesday with their own rally against what they see as the erosion of their special freedoms.\n\nThe semi-autonomous territory has been embroiled for months in the worst unrest since Britain returned the financial hub to China in 1997, with police and hardcore protesters trading tear gas for petrol bombs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Chinese woman holds a national flag following the flag raising ceremony while visiting Tiananmen Square on 27 September Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nIn an apparent olive branch, Xi vowed on Monday to continue to \u201cfully and faithfully implement\u201d the one country-two systems policy under which Hong Kong residents enjoy freedoms unseen on the mainland.\n\nBut Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was invited to the national day celebration, highlighting Beijing\u2019s continued support for the under-fire leader.\n\nThe Guardian view on the People\u2019s Republic of China at 70: whose history? | Editorial Read more\n\nCommunist party grandees will watch as 15,000 soldiers march across Tiananmen, 580 pieces of military equipment are shown off and 160 aircraft roar overhead.\n\n\u201cBeijing wants to highlight its military modernisation, political unity, and determination to protect its interests,\u201d Ni said.\n\nThe Communist party has repeatedly defied the odds to remain in power for seven decades.\n\nUnder Mao, tens of millions of people died during the disastrous Great Leap Forward, and the country was plunged into violent chaos during the decade-long Cultural Revolution.\n\nAfter Mao died in 1976, the party launched the reform and opening-up policy under the paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, starting decades of breakneck growth and development.\n\nChina prepares to mark 70 years of People\u2019s Republic \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nBut the Communist party retained a stranglehold on power, sending troops to end the biggest challenge to its rule in 1989 when pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square.\n\nXi\u2019s address on Tuesday is likely to invoke his \u201cChinese dream\u201d, the \u201crejuvenation\u201d of a nation that is seeking what it sees as a return to former glory.\n\nThe party wants to show \u201cthat under the leadership of the CCP, China is making strides toward becoming a rich and powerful country\u201d, said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\nThe Chinese leader has made clear that be believes only the Communist party can make the country realise its dream \u2013 with him at the helm.", "description": "New weapons \u2013 including a hypersonic drone and a ballistic missile that can reach the US \u2013 are expected to make their public debut", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f468ddd900092679ca2d5f8f32eb2fe1dc6af267/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=216bf81bd269b586296a0e51193729af", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
