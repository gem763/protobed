REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The rapidly growing internet sector accounted for $2.1 trillion of the U.S. economy in 2018, or about 10% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), an industry group said on Thursday.\n\nThe Internet Association, a group representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Uber Technology Inc (UBER.N) and many other firms, released its estimate as the tech sector has come under increasing criticism, with some lawmakers calling for the breakup of major firms and renewed antitrust scrutiny.\n\nThe study says the internet sector represents the fourth largest sector of the U.S. economy, behind real estate, government and manufacturing.\n\nLast year, manufacturing accounted for about $2.3 trillion in U.S. GDP.\n\nThe study found that the internet sector has nearly 6 million direct jobs, which accounts for 4% of U.S. jobs, while U.S. internet firms spent $64 billion in capital expenditures. The study also found the internet sector indirectly supports another 13 million jobs.\n\nIn 2015, the Internet Association estimated the sector was responsible for an estimated $966.2 billion, or 6% GDP in 2014.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in April estimated the \u201cdigital economy\u201d accounted for 6.9% of the 2017 U.S. GDP, or $1.35 trillion, in 2017, placing it in seventh place overall. That definition includes digital-enabling infrastructure, e-commerce transactions, and digital media but does not include ride-sharing services and other goods and services connected to the \u201csharing\u201d economy.\n\nThe Internet Association study used Census, BEA, and SEC government data from 2018 to estimate the internet sector\u2019s contributions to the American economy. The group\u2019s chief economist, Christopher Hooton said the internet industry is \u201ccreating jobs in every sector of the economy\u201d and said the new analysis more accurately captures the internet\u2019s economic impact.\n\nThe BEA study notes that employees working in the U.S. digital economy earned $132,223 in average compensation in 2017, compared to $68,506 per worker for the total U.S. economy.", "description": "The rapidly growing internet sector accounted for $2.1 trillion of the U.S. economy in 2018, or about 10% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP), an industry group said on Thursday.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434269935&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1X0-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
