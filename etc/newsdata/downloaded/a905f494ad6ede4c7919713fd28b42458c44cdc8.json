Between TVA and the two commissioned debates, I think Blanchet probably had the best performance of all six leaders,\" said Scott Reid, former advisor to prime minister Paul Martin.\n\nNDP strategist and former press secretary to Jack Layton, Karl B\u00e9langer, agrees, adding that the dimensions of the campaign look a lot different now than they did six weeks ago.\n\n\"We have a different campaign. There were a lot of assumptions at the beginning of the campaign like the NDP were dead in the water and separatism was dead too, well guess what it\u2019s not,\u201d said B\u00e9langer. \"So right now, the Bloc Quebecois is in a position not to get 20 or 30 seats, but maybe 40 or 50 seats.\"\n\nRight now, he said, the two front-runners aren\u2019t in a position to form majority governments, something he doesn\u2019t see changing during the final stretch.\n\n\"It\u2019s Thanksgiving weekend, the opinions are crystalizing during this weekend as people talk over pumpkin pie and turkey and we\u2019re going to end up with a minority government, I just don\u2019t know what colour it will be.\"\n\nThe Bloc\u2019s surging popularity, which the polls show isn\u2019t slowing down, will impact the overall electoral math on election night especially as it involves the second largest province in Canada.\n\nBallot box issue still up for grabs\n\nAll three pundits conceded that no single issue has come out on top as the key defining indicator that could tip the scale in favour of one party over another.\n\n\"There isn\u2019t one right now, and that\u2019s a problem for Justin Trudeau,\" said B\u00e9langer.\n\nHe said the incumbent Liberal leader\u2019s message will instead likely be fear-based.\n\n\"Forget blackface, forget Aga Khan, forget SNC, and vote to prevent the barbarians from getting in,\" B\u00e9langer said.\n\nReid predicts the Liberals will make the ballot box issue one of comparison, positing their base beside the Doug Ford and Andrew Scheer camps focused on spending \u201ccuts.\u201d\n\n\"This is a different campaign for the next eight days, particularly for the Liberals. The best thing, probably the only thing they can do, is scare the living hell out of NDP and Green voters and say 'There\u2019s a real possibility of a Scheer prime ministership. If you want to stop that, get on board with me.'\"\n\nThe Conservatives released their costed platform on Friday with a priority to balance the budget by 2024-25, which would require \u2013 as laid out in the plan \u2013 stripping back on measures like business subsidies, foreign aid, and the carbon tax.\n\nTory strategist and former campaign director for Stephen Harper, Jenni Byrne, said while no single issue has made a serious impact on party popularity thus far, \u201cpolarization\u201d will likely dictate the tone of the remaining days.\n\nShe added that Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer\u2019s base would be wise to keep intensifying their ground game, heading into the final stretch to capture the votes of Canadians whose opinions aren\u2019t yet solidified.\n\n\"Thanksgiving weekend the last election saw a record number of people went out to the advanced polls,\u201d said Byrne. \u201cYou should be reaching out to those current undecideds and pulling them into the polling station.\"", "description": "Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet and his supporters are shifting the campaign dynamic eight days out from the election, putting some parties at risk of losing third-party status or gaining enough seats to win a majority government, political insiders say.", "authors": ["Sarah Turnbull"], "top_image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4606323.1569260483!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
