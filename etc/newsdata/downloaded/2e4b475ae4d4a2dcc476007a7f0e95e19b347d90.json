The Riches\u2019 attorneys claim Wheeler wasn\u2019t allowed to comment to the media without permission from the family but Fox made his comments public anyway, taking advantage of his previous allegiance to the network.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge George Daniels said those alleged steps, taken individually, were not so outrageous to sustain a suit for inflicting emotional distress, but the appeals court said when all the claims were considered they did meet the standard.\n\n\u201cThese allegations, taken together, plausibly rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct,\u201d Calabresi said. The 2nd Circuit panel also noted that the defendants knew that the Riches were in extreme distress because of their son\u2019s death and allegedly pressed forward with the scheme despite that.\n\nCalabresi\u2019s opinion seeks to sidestep First Amendment concerns by noting that the plaintiffs will still be required to prove \u201cactual malice\u201d to prevail with the suit, essentially that the defendants knew the WikiLeaks link was false or acted with reckless disregard for whether it was true or not.\n\nThe appeals court ruling also says the case doesn\u2019t tee up the issue of whether ordinary newsgathering could trigger liability for interfering in a source\u2019s contract pledging confidentiality to someone else.\n\n\u201cThe allegations \u2014 which we have to take as true \u2014 are that Zimmerman and Butowsky (i) intentionally planted a biased investigator to gain the trust of a grieving family; (ii) fed false information to the investigator with the sole purpose of exploiting that investigator\u2019s relationship with the family to give credence to a politically motivated story; and (iii) knew, from the very start, that this story was nothing more than a false conspiracy theory,\u201d Calabresi wrote. \u201cAll that is more than enough to counter any possible justification.\u201d\n\nThe judges also seemed troubled that while Fox retracted Zimmerman\u2019s reports and deleted them from the network\u2019s website, related segments from Fox host Sean Hannity\u2019s program remain online.\n\n\u201cTo this day, Fox News makes available online at least two videos repeating, almost verbatim, the content of the Zimmerman story,\u201d Calabresi wrote, adding that the court found the videos up as recently as Thursday.\n\nA statement from Fox and a separate comment from an attorney for Butowsky expressed disappointment in the appeals court\u2019s ruling, but said the suit will eventually run aground because the key claims in it are simply not true.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s ruling today permits Mr. and Mrs. Rich to proceed with discovery to determine whether there is a factual basis for their claims against Fox News,\u201d the Fox statement said. \u201cAnd while we extend the Rich family our deepest condolences for their loss, we believe that discovery will demonstrate that Fox News did not engage in conduct that will support the Riches\u2019 claims. We will be evaluating our next legal steps.\u201d\n\nButowsky\u2019s lawyer, Ty Clevenger, noted that the appeals court was required at the early stage of the suit to assume that all the claims in the Riches\u2019 complaint were accurate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a setback for us, but only a temporary one,\u201d Clevenger told POLITICO. \u201cThe Second Circuit had to accept the Rich\u2019s allegations as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss. We\u2019re confident we can prove that those allegations are not true, so we still expect to prevail in the end.\u201d\n\nCalabresi, Underhill and Daniels were appointed by President Bill Clinton.
