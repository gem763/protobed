But New York Fed officials said Friday they were also examining whether the distribution of those reserves across the banking system\u2014and not just the absolute level\u2014had contributed to cash shortages earlier this week.\n\n\u201cThat ability of the system to move money around and redistribute\u2014it didn\u2019t work the way we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d said New York Fed President John Williams in an interview on Friday.\n\nThe New York Fed said on Friday it would continue to offer to add at least $75 billion daily to the financial system through Oct. 10, prolonging its efforts to relieve pressure in money markets.\n\nIn addition to at least $75 billion in overnight loans, the Fed said it would also offer three separate 14-day cash loans of at least $30 billion each next week. The Fed will conduct further operations as needed after Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cThis is, I would say, Central Banking 101,\u201d said Mr. Williams. \u201cThis is what the Fed\u2019s open-market operations are designed to address\u2014directly provide liquidity into the system, which supports market functioning.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, corporate tax payments were due to the Treasury, and Treasury debt auctions settled, leading to large transfers of cash from the banking system.\n\nThe level of reserves in the system at the beginning of the week appeared \u201cabove what we thought banks\u2019 minimum level of reserves was,\u201d said Lorie Logan, the New York Fed executive who is interim manager of the portfolio.\n\nBut those reserves can be concentrated in a few institutions, and officials weren\u2019t sure \u201cwhat the distribution process would look like as different shocks like this take place and how those reserves would then redistribute to other entities that needed liquidity,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the lessons this week was that this distribution process \u201cwas definitely stickier than we expected,\u201d and repo markets experienced greater dysfunction than anticipated as a result, she said.\n\nThe Fed is adding money to the financial system through the market for repurchase agreements, or repo. In those transactions, banks offer collateral such as government bonds in exchange for short-term loans, for periods as brief as overnight. The market is a major way that banks and financial firms raise capital to fund their businesses.\n\nThe Fed should have been more alert to the potential risks in the repo market, said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS and a former Fed staffer. He said the firm\u2019s traders had first picked up signs markets could face stress as repo rates began ticking higher late last week.\n\nBut the Fed restored confidence, particularly through its decision Friday to offer two-week cash loans. \u201cEverybody saw that as their bazooka,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said.\n\nThe newly scheduled operations give financial markets an assurance that the Fed will continue adding liquidity through the end of the coming quarter. Banks tend to hold on to cash at the ends of quarters because that is when regulators typically examine their balance sheets to ensure they are following rules that safeguard the banking system.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of cash to right the system,\u201d said Glenn Havlicek, the chief executive at GLMX, which provides technology to repo trading desks, and who formerly oversaw the repo desk at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThe timing is also important because there have been periods in the past year when demand for cash has exceeded the ability or willingness of investors to provide it, leading to spikes in the rates investors charge banks in repo.\n\nThat happened at the end of last year when the repo rate traded as high as 6%, pushing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.\u2019s GCF Repo Index to a then-record 5.14%. Repo rates also notably rose in April when people withdrew cash from the banking system to pay federal income taxes.\n\nSeparately, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday to a range between 1.75% and 2%.\n\nAs a result of volatility in the repo market, the fed-funds rate spiked to trade outside of its range on Tuesday, but by Thursday was again trading firmly within the target band.\n\nMr. Williams said the central bank had effectively diagnosed and deployed its tools to take \u201cforceful, decisive action that addressed the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are consistently and constructively supporting stability in these markets, and supporting the FOMC\u2019s desired interest rate.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, banks asked for $75.55 billion in reserves, $550 million more than the amount offered by the Fed, offering collateral in the form of Treasury and mortgage securities.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s operation was the fourth time this week it has intervened to calm roiled money markets. Rates on short-term repos briefly rose to nearly 10% earlier this week as financial firms looked for overnight funding. The actions marked the first time since the financial crisis that the Fed had taken such measures.\n\nThe New York Fed hasn\u2019t had to intervene in money markets since 2008 because during and after the financial crisis, the Fed flooded the financial system with reserves. It did this by buying hundreds of billions of dollars of long-term securities to spur growth after cutting interest rates to nearly zero.\n\nReserves over the last five years have been declining, especially over the last two years, when the Fed began shrinking securities holdings. Reserves fell to less than $1.4 trillion this week from a peak of $2.8 trillion in 2014.\n\nThe Fed stopped shrinking its asset holdings last month. But because other Fed liabilities such as currency in circulation and the Treasury\u2019s general financing account are rising, reserves are likely to grind lower in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com and Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "Federal Reserve officials are studying whether market plumbing issues contributed to a spike in short-term lending rates this week.", "authors": ["Daniel Kruger", "Nick Timiraos", "Daniel.Kruger Wsj.Com", "Nick.Timiraos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109157/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
