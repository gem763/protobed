Scary, but a useful in this rare scenario.\n\nThe system called ClearSight Ground View - which is a \u00a3575 optional extra - uses cameras mounted in the front grille and on the door mirrors project their view onto the central touchscreen of the 4X4 so the driver can see in a 180 degree view what is ahead of and underneath the front of the vehicle.\n\nIt has a practical use in an urban environment by helping drivers spot high city centre kerbs when parking, and avoid scuffing their wheels.\n\nLand Rover first signalled the X-Ray technology in 2014 but this is its first use in a showroom vehicle available to customers.\n\nRay tested out the new technology while driving across a single-track disused railway bridge more than 150 feet above the Corinth canal in Greece\n\nThe ClearSight Ground View - costing \u00a3575 - lets you see what lurks below the car\n\nWhile the system will rarely be used for driving over old railway bridges, motorists will be able to check how close they are to high kerbs and potholes\n\nThe new Evoque 4X4 also has eyes in the back of its head thanks to a smart rear-view mirror specifically designed to overcome a problem with the restricted view through letter-box shaped rear window which, while it allows the SUV to look sleek, is not great for visibility.\n\nTo overcome this, the traditional reflective rear view mirror transforms at the flick of a switch into a high definition video screen displaying the images from a rear-facing camera positioned above the rear window.\n\nAgain, you have to pay extra for the feature - a fairly hefty \u00a3450.\n\nThe picture is pin sharp. And thanks to a wider 50-degree field of vision it\u2019s like watching a hi-definition movie in Cinemascope.\n\nBut the beauty is that it means the driver\u2019s view also remains unrestricted by passengers or large items of luggage or kit in the back. This technology also delivers clearer visibility in low light conditions.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The new Evoque 4X4 also has eyes in the back of its head thanks to a smart rear-view mirror. It switches from the traditional view to a camera screen at the flick of a switch\n\nRay Massey used the feature to peer down at railway tracks, sleepers and \u2013 through the cracks in the bridge \u2013 the water far below\n\nThis is what it looks like when you take a \u00a339,000 (in this spec) SUV over a bridge 150 feet above a gorge\n\nThe camera is designed with a protective lip and a special water repellent coating to prevent mud and water spray soiling the lens.\n\nIf the the camera is ever obscured, drivers can change back to a traditional rear view mirror at the flick of a switch.\n\nBut the clever tech should not overshadow what a smart package the new Evoque provides and how fun and practical it is to drive. It\u2019s an evolution rather than a revolution and doesn\u2019t look radically different. The devil is in the detail.\n\nIt has an all new body shell, though will only be available with five doors after Range Rover decided to do away with the three-door coupe option for the second coming of Evoque.\n\nThanks to a longer wheel-base, the new model has more interior space and knee-room for rear passengers, 10 per cent more luggage space sufficient for a set of golf clubs, and extra cubby-hole storage. It also has new 21-inch wheels.\n\nThe slick 9-speed automatic gearbox has been improved, too.\n\nThe clever off-roading tech meant it made mince-meat of rough gravel roads and coped far better than I expected with some fairly challenging rutted tracks, steep mountain inclines, and large rock-strewn tracks.\n\nThe clever tech should not overshadow what a smart package the new Evoque provides and how fun and practical it is to drive\n\nIt\u2019s an evolution rather than a revolution and doesn\u2019t look radically different. The devil is in the detail, says Ray Massey\n\nThanks to a longer wheel-base, the new Evoque has more interior space and knee-room for rear passengers\n\nI also took it across and through a few streams and small rivers \u2013 conscious that it can now wade through 600mm of water \u2013 up by 100mm.\n\nIt can also hold itself when heading up a slippery steep incline, without rolling back.\n\nFor off-roading there are four main modes - Comfort, Sand, Grass-Gravel-Snow, and Mud & Ruts, plus a new Auto mode which by automatically selects the most appropriate setting for the conditions and adjusts the vehicle accordingly.\n\nAt launch is a range of 48-volt battery-aided mild hybrid 2.0-litre four-cylinder Ingenium petrol and diesel engines linked to a nine-speed automatic gearbox promising fuel economy of up to 50.4mpg.\n\nThe powertrain uses an engine mounted generator to harvest energy normally lost during deceleration and store it in the under-floor battery to give the car a boost when needed.\n\nRay Massey took the compact 4X4 across and through a few streams and small rivers \u2013 conscious that it can now wade through 600mm of water \u2013 up by 100mm\n\nAt speeds below 11mph the engine shuts off while the driver applies the brakes to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions\n\nAn eco-friendly three-cylinder plug-in hybrid version is to follow in 12 months\u2019 time and there may even be an all-electric version\n\nAt speeds below 11mph the engine shuts off while the driver applies the brakes.\n\nWhen the driver pulls away, the stored energy is redeployed to boost the engine under acceleration and thus reduce fuel consumption.\n\nAn eco-friendly three-cylinder plug-in hybrid version is to follow in 12 months\u2019 time and there may even be an all-electric version.\n\nDiesels will still be the biggest sellers, though.\n\nI spent most time driving the very able Evoque S D240 in a fetching exterior shade of Firenze Red.\n\nThe comfortable interior and supportive seats were clad in the vegan-friendly - but very sophisticated - Cloud Eucalyptus textile and Ultrafabrics man-made cloths.
