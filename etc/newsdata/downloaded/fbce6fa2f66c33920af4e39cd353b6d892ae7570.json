But it gets worse: It\u2019s estimated that five million South Africans have pre-diabetes (a.k.a. almost diabetes, when your blood sugar levels are high, but not high enough for full-blown diabetes) \u2013 and 90% of those people don\u2019t know they have it either.\n\nRemind me what diabetes is again\n\nDiabetes isn\u2019t just one disease. There are actually three types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Most people with diabetes have type 2 \u2013 it happens when your body doesn\u2019t use insulin well and is unable to keep your blood sugar stable, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nType 1 diabetes is much less common \u2013 only about 5% of those with diabetes have type 1 \u2013 and it\u2019s essentially an autoimmune disease where your body stops making insulin at all (and as such, can\u2019t regulate blood sugar).\n\nAnd gestational diabetes occurs in pregnant women \u2013 it usually goes away after you give birth, but it can increase your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later on, according to the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\n\nAll three types of diabetes can easily be detected through a blood test. The test, essentially, checks to see if your blood glucose (a.k.a. blood sugar) is too high. But be warned: You can\u2019t diagnose yourself \u2013 not even with an OTC blood glucose meter, per the NIDDK.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are walking around with undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes because the symptoms are super-subtle, says Dr Poorani Goundan, an endocrinologist at Boston Medical Center.\n\nThese sneaky diabetes symptoms might indicate that it\u2019s time to head into your doctor\u2019s office for a test.\n\nRead more: This new research suggests that diabetes is actually 5 separate diseases\n\n1. You have to pee all the time\n\nWhen you have excess sugar coursing through your bloodstream, your body instinctively tries to get rid of it, says endocrinologist Dr Mary Vouyiouklis Kellis. \u201cWater follows sugar, so you end up having high-volume urine loss,\u201d she explains.\n\nIf you notice you\u2019re suddenly peeing a lot, and more often, for no real reason \u2013 especially if you\u2019re waking up a few times during the night to go \u2013 it\u2019s time to talk to your doctor, she says.\n\n2. You never stop drinking water\n\nWith all that peeing, dehydration is a very real possibility. And, to make matters worse, \u201csome patients who don\u2019t know they have diabetes quench their thirst with sugary drinks like soda or juice, which adds to their blood sugars,\u201d Goundan says. Signs of dehydration include dark-coloured urine, a drop in (water) weight and extreme thirst.\n\nSound familiar? Talk to your doc about this potential symptom of diabetes, especially if it occurs in tandem with lots of bathroom breaks.\n\n3. Your breath smells awful\n\nDiabetes-related dehydration contributes to dry mouth and the bad breath that can accompany it. (After all, with dry mouth, there\u2019s not enough spit to wash away bacteria and balance the pH in your mouth, Kellis says.)\n\nWhat\u2019s more, undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes can trigger ketosis, a process in which the body uses fat, rather than glucose, for energy. Ketosis releases a chemical byproduct called ketones, which can make your breath smell unpleasantly sweet or fruity, she says \u2013 sometimes it might even smell like acetone, since that\u2019s a type of ketone.\n\nUnless you\u2019re on a keto diet (which is designed to put you into ketosis), it\u2019s worth talking to your doctor.\n\nRead more: 6 ways to make diabetes MUCH easier to manage\n\n4. Your vision\u2019s getting increasingly blurry\n\nBlurry vision is a common \u2013 and often ignored \u2013 diabetes symptom in women. What does diabetes have to do with your vision? Kellis explains that fluid can form in your eye\u2019s lens as sugar levels increase (remember: fluid follows sugar).\n\nA build-up of fluid in the eye blurs vision, causes nearsightedness, and sends many people to the optometrist for new glasses or contacts prescription.\n\nFortunately, getting your blood sugar levels under control can clear up blurred vision, she adds.\n\n5. Your hands and feet fall asleep a lot\n\nNeuropathy \u2013 a condition characterised by numbness or weird sensations like pins and needles in your arms, legs, hands and feet \u2013 occurs in more than half of people with type 2 diabetes, according to a 2017 Diabetes Care review.\n\nWhy so common? Diabetes reduces blood flow to your extremities and, over time, damages your blood vessels and nerves, Kellis says.\n\n6. Your cuts and bruises take forever to heal\n\nReduced sensation in your extremities makes you more prone to injuries. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to notice a cut because you can\u2019t feel it, which means you\u2019re less likely to take care of it and it\u2019s more likely to get infected,\u201d says Goundan.\n\nThen, once you do have an injury, uncontrolled diabetes can make it harder for your body to heal. \u201cHigh blood sugars provide a good environment for bacteria to grow,\u201d she says. That\u2019s because diabetes is also often accompanied by high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and the resulting plaque buildup can narrow blood vessels, reducing blood supply and leading to slow healing.\n\nDiabetes can also weaken the T-cells that make up your immune system \u2013 your body\u2019s defence against infection. \u201cWhen you have high blood sugar, it\u2019s like delaying your body\u2019s army to go to the wound to heal it,\u201d says Kellis.\n\n7. You\u2019re losing weight\u2026 but aren\u2019t trying to.\n\nUnexplained weight loss can happen for lots of reasons, and diabetes is one of them. Goundan explains that insulin helps your body move sugar from your blood to your cells, so when you have an insulin resistance, you don\u2019t get enough energy into your cells despite all that sugar flowing through your body. \u201cBecause you\u2019re unable to get enough energy from sugar, your body burns your own fat and muscle for energy,\u201d Kellis says. \u201cWeight loss can be pretty significant, sometimes 4.5 to 9 kilos.\u201d\n\nGenerally, doctors recommend visiting the doc if you unintentionally lose between five to 10 percent of your body weight over the course of six months.\n\nRead more: Everything you really need to know about diabetes\n\n8. You get enough sleep, but you\u2019re still so tired.\n\nCarbohydrates, which your body breaks down into glucose, are your body\u2019s main source of energy. But your body can\u2019t effectively use that source of energy when you have diabetes, explains Goundan. (And diabetes-related dehydration can also bring on fatigue.)\n\nOf course, there are tons of other reasons you could be feeling exhausted, including your diet, stress levels, and how much you\u2019ve been sleeping.\n\nStill, if you can\u2019t think of any other good reason for your extreme fatigue, and your low energy levels are accompanied by some of these other diabetes symptoms, it\u2019s worth getting checked out.\n\n9. You get a surprising number of yeast infections\n\nHigh blood sugars create an environment in your vagina that\u2019s ripe for yeast infections. \u201cGlucose is fuel for yeast. The more that\u2019s around, the more they can multiply,\u201d says Kellis.\n\nIf you\u2019re having two to three yeast infections every few months or if the standard treatments just aren\u2019t working, it\u2019s time to see a doctor. \u201cOnce blood sugar is controlled, the frequency goes down,\u201d says Goundan.\n\n10. You\u2019ve got weird dark spots on your skin\n\nDarkening skin around the nape of your neck, under your armpits, or even in your groin area is a surprising and common early sign of insulin resistance, the precursor to diabetes \u2013 the medical name for the condition is acanthosis nigricans (AN).\n\n\u201cWe see this often in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),\u201d says Kellis, who notes that women with PCOS are at an increased risk of insulin issues. If you notice new dark spots on your skin, they\u2019re worth checking out with your doctor.\n\nRead more: 7 diabetes food swaps anyone who wants to lose weight should know\n\n11. You feel really itchy all the time\n\nThose with diabetes often experience itching due to yeast infections (which can occur on the skin, too), dry skin, or poor circulation, according to the American Diabetes Association. If poor circulation is to blame, your legs will be the itchiest area.\n\nPer the ADA, you can try to treat the itching yourself by limiting how much you bathe (especially in less humid climates), using soap with a built-in moisturiser, and remembering to apply lotion immediately after washing up.\n\n\n\nThis article was originally published on womenshealthmag.com\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "You might want to do a breath check.", "authors": ["Colleen De Bellefonds"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8192/e0d0f63a879f4eaf862e9be4a87cffb9.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-22"}
