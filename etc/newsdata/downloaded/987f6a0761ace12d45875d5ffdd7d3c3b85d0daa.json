Alfallaj, 35, a Saudi Arabian citizen, was arrested on February 2018 based on a criminal complaint in Oklahoma alleging he'd lied to the FBI and attended terror training sites in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The U.S. government identified the defendant after finding his fingerprints on an application to join Al Qaeda that the U.S. military had gathered from the battlefields of Afghanistan,\u201d Assistant Attorney General John Demers of the National Security Division said in a Justice Department statement.\n\nTALIBAN VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN RAMPS UP AS SUICIDE BOMBER KILLS AT LEAST 20\n\nAlfallaj pleaded guilty to possessing a visa obtained by fraud from March 2012 to 2018 and making false statements to the FBI.\n\nFederal prosecutors said he came to the U.S. in 2011 on a nonimmigrant visa based on his wife's foreign student status. He allegedly lied on his visa application about whether he supports terrorists or terror groups.\n\nThe FBI said it found 15 of Alfallaj's fingerprints on an application to an Al Qaeda training site in Afghanistan leading up to the 9/11 attacks. American forces found the document in an Afghan safe house. It included an emergency phone number associated with Alfallaj's father in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cWe were able to match those fingerprints with fingerprints taken for his U.S. visa application and to determine that he had made false statements in that application in order to conceal his attendance at an Al Qaeda training camp in 2000,\" Demers said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"He also admitted he falsely told federal agents during the December 2017 interview that he had never visited Afghanistan or participated in religious, tactical, or military training outside Saudi Arabia, and otherwise affirmed falsely that all of the answers on his nonimmigrant visa application were true and correct,\u201d the news release states.\n\nIn 2013, Alfallaj inquired in an online forum about fighting in Afghanistan or Chechnya, prosecutors said.\n\nHe will be deported once he completes his prison sentence.", "description": "A former Oklahoma resident was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison for visa fraud and concealing his attendance at an Al-Qaeda training camp, authorities said Thursday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/iStock-gavel.jpg"}
