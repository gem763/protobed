The Mint is wholly owned by the Western Australian government.\n\nThe endeavour began in late 2018 when it launched GoldPass in collaboration with local fintech startup InfiniGold \u2014 a mobile app that allows investors to instantly buy, sell, and transfer physical gold via digital certificates.\n\nPhysical Perth Mint gold backs each of those certificates, and the government guarantees that gold. It is these certificates that will be tokenized in the form of an ERC-20 cryptocurrency, also issued by InfiniGold.\n\n\u201cThe digitization of gold via a public ledger is a natural progression for the global commodity markets,\u201d said Perth Mint CEO Richard Hayes. \u201cIt will promote gold as a mainstream asset, enhance its accessibility, and offer greater liquidity, transparency and auditability of the real assets backing this type of digital token.\u201d\n\nMarketing materials further state PMGT\u2019s liquidity is to be provided by \u201cmarket makers\u201d and enabled via the GoldPass platform.\n\nMany of these kinds of stablecoins have failed before\n\nThe firm is angling PMGT as an alternative to USD-backed stablecoins. It hopes the tokens will be one day tradable with traditional products like gold ETFs and CME gold futures.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly cool that a sovereign government appears confident enough to deploy a token on a public blockchain like Ethereum, but those involved should remain cautious.\n\nBack in June, Hard Fork reported that two-thirds of failed stablecoin projects launched since 2017 were backed by physical gold.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
