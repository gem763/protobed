I would be nothing without it [\u2026] If there\u2019s a reboot of the show, it won\u2019t be as good as what it was, so why do it? It would ruin it.\"\n\nHer words echoed those of Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman who has always insisted that a reboot would never happen.\n\nShe famously said: \"The show is about a time in your life when your friends are your family. It's not that time anymore. All we'd be doing is putting those six actors back together, but the heart of the show would be gone.\"\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nAniston was also asked about her dating life while on the radio show - but she firmly shifted the conversation back to her work.\n\nIn reply to a question about whether she was seeing anyone since her split from former husband Justin Theroux in 2017, she stated: \"I\u2019m very busy. For now. I\u2019m promoting [ The Morning Show ]. I\u2019m prepping for next season.\"\n\nHowever, the celeb did go on to reveal that she hates being set up on dates.\n\nStern suggested he set her up with someone, to which she responded: \"Not right now. But listen, I just don\u2019t like being set up. I don\u2019t like it. Hate it.\"\n\nAniston is next set to appear in The Morning Show on Apple TV alongside Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell. The show premieres on November 1.", "description": "Jennifer Aniston once said she'd love to do a Friends reboot but it looks like she might have changed her mind", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Nbc Via Getty Images", "Wireimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18875911.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Photocall-Of-Netflixs-Murder-Mystery.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
