He and others in the FPO worry they would be negotiating from a position of weakness.\n\nSome commentators think it would make sense for Kurz to join forces with the resurgent Green party, which has 26 seats, and the Neos with 15 seats, but it will not be easy to bridge policy differences with the Greens, led by Werner Kogler.\n\nAustrian President and former Greens leader Alexander van der Bellen has encouraged Kurz to put climate change atop the political agenda - especially as surveys show the environment is the top concern of Austrian voters.\n\nBut for now Kurz has focused on boosting a fragile economy, cutting taxes on workers and retirees, and fighting illegal migration - policies more in line with the FPO.\n\nWhile Kurz could get a slim majority with the Greens, he may be wary of going with them alone because he would risk being at the mercy of a handful of its left-wing lawmakers - making the Neos an option for a three-way coalition.\n\nThe bad blood between the OVP and the SPO makes a coalition between the two biggest parties unlikely.\n\nFar-right politician Strache has retreated from the political stage since the video scandal but revived speculation of a comeback at the head of a new movement by posting on Facebook that any party he led could easily win seats.\n\nHe posted the remark after FPO leaders decided not to award an open seat in parliament to his wife, animal rights activist Philippa Strache, who was on the party's list of candidates.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Shields and Kirsti Knolle; editing by David Clarke)", "description": "VIENNA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Austrian conservative leader  Sebastian Kurz opened talks with potential coalition partners on  Tuesday after his People's Party...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
