NARU GUARDA CABADDU/via REUTERS\n\nGovernment authorities were starting to receive reports from field officials on the island of Mindanao where the earthquake struck, opening cracks in buildings and homes, sending residents running from shops and offices and knocking power out.\n\n\u201cOur hospital chief reported that a child died because of the earthquake,\u201d Reuel Limbungan, mayor of Tulunan town in North Cotabato province, told the DZMM radio station. Two more people were injured, he added.\n\nThe earthquake also shook Davao City, the hometown of President Rodrigo Duterte and among the most populous cities in the country.\n\nIn Magsaysay town, in the nearby province of Davao del Sur, 20 people were injured by falling debris and home furniture, Anthony Allada, the municipality\u2019s information officer, told DZMM.\n\n\u201cMany houses were totally damaged... Another person is in a critical condition,\u201d Allada said.\n\nThe municipality of M\u2019lang, in Cotabato province, reported three injuries, Vice Mayor Joselito Pinol told DZMM radio.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 69 km (43 miles) north-northwest of the city of General Santos, Mindanao at 7:39 p.m. (1137 GMT). The epicentre was about 80 km southwest of central Davao.\n\n\u201cWe felt a very strong jolt and there was a blackout. I saw people rushing down. We were panicking, heading to the exit,\u201d said Naru Guarda Cabaddu, a hotel consultant visiting Kidapawan City, between the epicentre of the quake and Davao.\n\nThe Philippines is on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences frequent earthquakes.\n\n\u201cI was driving back home when I felt a very powerful shake. I stopped and saw people and patients running out of the hospital,\u201d Raprap Rafael, a resident of Kidapawan City, told Reuters. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping at my home tonight.\u201d\n\nRenato Solidum, head of the Philippines seismic agency, told the ANC news channel there was a chance of aftershocks, which could be strong and capable of causing severe damage.\n\n\u201cAftershocks can happen. Some can be felt most likely in low intensities. But we cannot remove the possibility of similar intensities that can be felt in the epicentral area,\u201d he said.", "description": "A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck the southern Philippines on Wednesday, killing at least one child and injuring more than two dozen other people.", "authors": ["Neil Jerome Morales", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441490799&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F179", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
