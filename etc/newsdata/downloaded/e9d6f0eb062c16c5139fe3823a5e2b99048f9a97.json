Through the end of September, the registered urban unemployment rate was 3.61 percent, down 0.21 percentage points compared with the same period last year.\n\nEmployment in some key groups such as college graduates and demobilized military staff members saw stable growth. According to the ministry, about 1.33 million people who had difficulty finding jobs received help from governments of different levels in the last three quarters.\n\nFor example, Anhui province provides 3,000 yuan ($424) in financial incentives to college students, encouraging them to take positions in small and medium-sized enterprises rather than merely applying for jobs in State-owned or large companies.\n\nMoreover, entrepreneurial training courses are open to college students in the province. So far, about 15,000 college students have joined the courses, with loans of over 70 million yuan provided to the students.\n\nZhang Ying, the ministry's director in employment promotion, said at a news conference on Monday that though the employment rate faces continuous pressure, it has seen reasonable growth, and more supportive policies will be carried out to further spur it.\n\nShe said that more preferential policies\uff0dsuch as cutting taxes and offering subsidies on insurance\uff0dwill be given to enterprises who reduce layoffs.\n\nAccording to the ministry, about 27.5 billion yuan was given to 750,000 enterprises over the past nine months as a reward for their efforts to stabilize employment.\n\nSkill-improving training courses are in the pipeline to help more people who have difficulty finding work to get jobs, and financial support is also being given to those learning and improving skills. In fact, the ministry said that about 1.3 billion yuan has been given to 810,000 people to help them boost their working skills.\n\nShe said that intensive job fairs began on Monday and will run through Nov 21, while job fairs for college graduates will operate in late November and December.", "description": "Nation's target for new jobs in 2019 nearly met in first nine months of year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/22/5dae3d92a310cf3e97a24d24.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
