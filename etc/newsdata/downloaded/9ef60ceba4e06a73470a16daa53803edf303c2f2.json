(IRBT) .\n\nIn this daily bar chart of IRBT, below, we can see a small double top pattern in March and April of last year followed by a steep decline that has more than cut prices in half. IRBT is below the declining 50-day moving average line and the falling 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has declined sharply from late April and tells us that sellers of IRBT have been very aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a sell mode below the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of IRBT, below, we can see that prices are testing a key support area from 2017-2018 in the $60-$57 area. A break of this key level is likely to precipitate further declines.\n\nPrices are below the declining 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bearish and so is the MACD oscillator.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of IRBT, below, we can see a possible downside price target of $49.\n\nBottom line strategy: All of our charts and indicators of IRBT are bearish.
