He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS. Cummings was very popular in his district, where he was a key member of the community.\n\nCummings said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in January that he was one of the few members of Congress who lived in an inner city environment.\n\n\"I like to be among my constituents,\" he said. \"Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go \u2013 I might as well stay home.\"\n\nElijah Cummings funeral speakers\n\nHere is the list of speakers at Cummings' funeral on Friday, according to Pelosi's office:", "description": "Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaking at funeral for longtime Maryland congressman", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/25/90122943-028a-41fe-b76b-15abff618f5b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/9790b59cbcafffa7a8bd05f0507fd1c2/hillary-gettyimages-1178071791.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
