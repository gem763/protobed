His is a diplomacy of narcissism, bent on advancing private interests at the expense of our national interests.\n\nAmbassador Yovanovitch is not the first professional diplomat to find herself in political crosshairs in the history of the State Department. Trump is not the first demagogue to bully career personnel. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is not the first secretary of state derelict in his duty. But the damage from this assault\u2014coming from within the executive branch itself, after nearly three years of unceasing diplomatic self-sabotage, and at a particularly fragile geopolitical moment\u2014will likely prove to be even more severe to both diplomatic tradecraft and U.S. foreign policy.\n\nTHE NEW MCCARTHYISM\n\nAlmost 70 years ago, in the early years of the Cold War, Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted a savage campaign against \u201cdisloyalty\u201d in the State Department. Partisan investigators, untethered to evidence or ethics, forced out 81 department employees in the first half of the 1950s. Among them was John Paton Davies, Jr., an accomplished China hand. His sin was to foresee the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. Davies was subjected to nine security and loyalty investigations, none of which substantiated the paranoid accusation that he was a communist sympathizer. Nevertheless, in a moment of profound political cowardice, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles fired him.\n\nPurging Davies and his colleagues was not only wrong but also foolish. The loss of such expertise blinded American diplomacy on China for a generation and had a chilling effect on the department and its morale. One of the United States\u2019 most distinguished diplomats, George Kennan, was also pushed out of the Foreign Service during this era. He tried to defend Davies, who had served with him in Moscow and on the Policy Planning Staff, to little avail. Years later, Kennan wrote in his memoirs that McCarthy\u2019s onslaught and the department\u2019s failure to defend its employees was the most \u201csobering and disillusioning\u201d episode of his long career.\n\nThat Senator McCarthy\u2019s chief counsel, Roy Cohn, was also Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer and mentor is one of history\u2019s sad ironies. Trump\u2019s scorched-earth tactics, casual relationship with truth, and contempt for career public service bear more than a passing resemblance to the playbook that Cohn wrote for McCarthy. And when Trump cried out for a \u201cnew Roy Cohn\u201d to replace the late original, it was hardly a surprise that former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared\u2014or that he dove into the muck of the Ukraine scandal and agitated for the removal of a career ambassador whose integrity and expertise proved to be an obstruction.\n\nOne might imagine that the State Department\u2019s leadership would stand up to the president and for its personnel\u2014so many of whom are doing hard jobs in hard places around the world. If only that were the case.\n\nTrump\u2019s scorched-earth tactics, casual relationship with truth, and contempt for career public service bear more than a passing resemblance to the playbook that Cohn wrote for McCarthy.\n\nInstead, today\u2019s leaders have shown no more spine than Dulles did. Secretary Pompeo apparently worked around the embassy in Kiev to advance the president\u2019s private agenda, allowed specious opposition research about Yovanovitch to circulate around the department, and sat on his hands as Trump slandered Yovanovitch on the infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and warned ominously that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d The ghost of Roy Cohn was smiling somewhere.\n\nEven before the Ukraine mess, the Trump administration had been waging a war on diplomacy for nearly three years. The White House regularly pushes historic cuts to diplomacy and development spending, which is already 19 times smaller than the defense budget. Career diplomats are sidelined, with only one of 28 assistant secretary-rank positions filled by a Foreign Service officer, and more ambassadorships going to political appointees in this administration than in any in recent history. One-fifth of ambassadorships remain unfilled, including critical posts.\n\nNot coincidentally, applications to join the Foreign Service have declined precipitously, with fewer people taking the entrance exam in 2019 than in more than two decades. The pace of resignations by career professionals is depressing, the pernicious practice of retaliation against individual officers just because they worked on controversial issues in the last administration is damning, and the silence from the department\u2019s leadership is deafening.\n\nAGAINST THE AMERICAN INTEREST\n\nLast spring, I wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs called \u201cThe Lost Art of American Diplomacy.\u201d It was meant less as an elegy than as a reminder of diplomacy\u2019s significance. I\u2019m feeling much more elegiac today.\n\nTo clean up the institutional wreckage in the State Department will take many years. The damage to our influence and reputation may prove to be even longer lasting\u2014and harder to repair.\n\nThe practical consequences are not hard to discern. If a U.S. ambassador doesn\u2019t speak for the president, and the embassy is seen as an enemy of the White House, why would the local government take seriously its diplomatic messages? Why use official channels, rather than speak directly to the president\u2019s personal lawyer and his grifting confidants? If the key to unlocking aid is stroking the president\u2019s vanity, why undertake the hard work of economic or political reform, with all the risks that entails?\n\nFor dictators, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving, a non-stop advertisement for Western self-dealing.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions distort diplomatic practice and decapitate the American interest. Because of them, a new Ukrainian administration is all the more exposed to corruption and democratic backsliding, and all the more vulnerable to Russian manipulation and aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin, professionally trained to manufacture compromising material on all sorts of opponents, couldn\u2019t have produced a more disruptive document than the summary of the Trump-Zelensky call last July, which has sowed political dysfunction in both Washington and Kiev.\n\nBy using his public office for personal gain, Trump has affirmed Putin\u2019s long-held conviction\u2014shared by autocrats the world over\u2014that Americans are just as venal and self-absorbed as they are, just more hypocritical about it. For dictators, Trump is the gift that keeps on giving, a non-stop advertisement for Western self-dealing. So much for enlightened self-interest. So much for the power of our example. So much for our credibility.\n\nWe are digging a deep hole for ourselves in a world that is changing fast, filled with players who won\u2019t wait for us to stop digging and a landscape that is quickly hardening against U.S. interests. Our allies are confused. Our adversaries are quick to take advantage. The institutions and coalitions we shaped over decades are wobbling. The confidence of the American people in the power and purpose of disciplined American leadership is evaporating.\n\nTHE URGENCY OF RENEWAL\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s dereliction of duty takes place at a time when the United States will need to rely on diplomacy more, not less, to advance its interests and values in an ever more competitive world.\n\nI closed my essay six months ago on a reasonably optimistic note. I acknowledged that a long, tough journey lay ahead\u2014that American diplomacy would take a lot longer to fix than it has taken to break. But I also emphasized the opportunity before us, which the malpractice of the Trump administration has thrown into sharp relief. The journey toward renewal will be even more arduous now, and even more urgent.", "description": "In my three and a half decades as a U.S. Foreign Service officer, proudly serving five presidents and ten secretaries of state from both parties, I\u2019ve never seen an attack on diplomacy as damaging, to both the State Department as an institution and our international influence, as the one now underway.", "authors": ["William J.
