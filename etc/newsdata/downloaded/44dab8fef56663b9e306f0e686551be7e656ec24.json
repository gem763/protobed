The water cannon fired blue jets of water, used elsewhere in the world to help identify protesters later.\n\n\u201cRadical protesters are currently occupying Harcourt Road in Admiralty, vandalising Central Government Offices and repeatedly throwing petrol bombs inside,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\nThe Chinese-ruled territory has been rocked by more than three months of clashes, with demonstrators angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing in their city\u2019s affairs despite a promise of autonomy.\n\nOn July 1, the anniversary of the city\u2019s 1997 return from Britain to China, protesters wearing hard hats, masks and black shirts laid siege to the Legislative Council building and swarmed inside.\n\nViolence has broken out on previous weekends with protesters trashing metro stations and setting fires in the streets. The police have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nThe spark for the protests was planned legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.\n\nThe protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, protesters gathered peacefully outside the British Consulate, calling on Britain to rein in China and ensure it respects the city\u2019s freedoms.\n\nPro-China demonstrators and anti-government protesters argue at Amoy Plaza shopping mall in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, China, September 14, 2019.

It has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States and Britain, of fomenting the unrest and told them to mind their own business.\n\nBritain says it has a legal responsibility to ensure China abides by the 1984 declaration.\n\nHong Kong island was granted to Britain \u201cin perpetuity\u201d in 1842 at the end of the First Opium War. Kowloon, a peninsula on the mainland opposite Hong Kong island, joined later, after the Second Opium War.\n\nThe colony was expanded to include the New Territories, to the north of Kowloon, on a 99-year lease, in 1898.\n\nBritain returned all of the territory to China, which never recognised the \u201cunequal treaties\u201d, in 1997.\n\n\u201cThe Joint Declaration is a legally binding treaty between the UK and China that remains as valid today as it was when it was signed and ratified over 30 years ago,\u201d a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in June.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\n\u201cAs a co-signatory, the UK government will continue to defend our position.\u201d\n\nBut it was not immediately clear what Britain could or would want to do to defend that position. It is pinning its hopes on closer trade and investment cooperation with China, which since 1997 has risen to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after it leaves the European Union at the end of next month.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired water cannon and volleys of tear gas to break up protesters throwing petrol bombs near the Legislative Council building and inside the Central Government Offices on Sunday, the latest in weeks of sometimes violent unrest.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429813875&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0HN", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
