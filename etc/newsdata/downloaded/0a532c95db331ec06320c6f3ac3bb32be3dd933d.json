Elijah Cummings was eulogized as a leader with the fiery moral conviction of an Old Testament prophet Friday at a funeral that brought former presidents and ordinary people alike to the Baltimore church where the congressman worshipped for four decades.\n\n\u201cOur Elijah was a fierce champion of truth, justice and kindness in every part of his life,\u201d said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who took the stage at the New Psalmist Baptist Church to rousing applause.\n\nCummings, a black sharecropper\u2019s son and civil rights leader who rose to power in Washington over two decades ago with his sonorous voice and powerful oratory, died of longstanding health problems Oct. 17 at age 68 while locked in political combat with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Baltimore Democrat led multiple investigations of the president, who recently lashed out at Cummings\u2019 district as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil on Capitol Hill seemed close at hand during the service.\n\nIn what sounded like a reference to the impeachment inquiry against Trump, former President Bill Clinton told the crowd, \u201cWe all know now that, at least until certain things happen, his legacy is how ardently he honored his oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew that without the Constitution, the laws that were passed under it, the rights that were guaranteed by it and the abuses it was designed to prevent \u2026 he would not have been in Congress,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cand so he said to himself, \u2018I am certain every day, I will not let this promise be sullied.'\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who as Democratic leader is overseeing the impeachment drive, took note in her eulogy of the bipartisan crowd at the church and said Cummings had the ability to work with both his fellow Democrats and with Republicans.\n\n\u201cOur Elijah always made a seat at the table for others,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama recalled Cummings\u2019 humble beginnings, saying: \u201cHis life validates the things we tell ourselves about what\u2019s possible in this country, not guaranteed, but possible.\u201d\n\nCummings\u2019s widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, told the crowd that Trump\u2019s recent jabs hurt her husband. Without mentioning the president by name, she said Cummings\u2019 job became \u201cinfinitely more difficult in the last months of his life when he sustained personal attacks and attacks on his beloved city.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile he carried himself with grace and dignity in all public forums, it hurt him,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump, who was in South Carolina on Friday, offered his condolences to the Cummings family during a speech and recalled the congressman\u2019s \u201cvery strong passion\u201d for lowering prescription drug prices, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d\n\nAt the church, gospel and R&B singer BeBe Winans, a favorite of Cummings, performed \u201cStand\u201d as mourners sang along, stood and raised their hands. Many wiped away tears. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren recited the 23rd Psalm.\n\n\u201cIt is no coincidence \u2014 is it? \u2014 that Elijah Cummings shared a name with an Old Testament prophet,\u201d Hillary Clinton told the crowd. \u201cLike the prophet, our Elijah could call down fire from heaven. But he also prayed and worked for healing. He weathered storms and earthquakes but never lost his faith.\u201d\n\nSeveral hundred people had lined up outside before dawn, waiting for the doors to open so they could pay their final respects to Cummings, who lay in an open casket in the grand, 4,000-seat sanctuary.\n\n\u201cI felt like it was my civic duty, my responsibility to come and pay respects to a man who has done so much for Baltimore city, so much for the people, trying to keep us together,\u201d said the Rev. Jacqueline Williams, 67, of Baltimore, as she waited in line.\n\nOn Thursday, Cummings became the first African American lawmaker to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nBobby Trotter, a 67-year-old Baltimore resident who lives just outside Cummings\u2019 district, recalled how the congressman helped quell tensions in the city after the rioting that erupted in 2015 over the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a spinal injury during a jolting ride in a police van.\n\nCummings \u201cbelieved in helping people, particularly people that were downtrodden. He stood up. He spoke for them,\u201d Trotter said.\n\nA family spokeswoman said the burial would be private.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Julio Cortez in Baltimore and Denise Lavoie in Richmond contributed to this report.", "description": "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Rep.
