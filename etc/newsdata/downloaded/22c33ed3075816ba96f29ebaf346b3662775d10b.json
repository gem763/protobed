(AP) - After all that drama, Kyler Murray\u2019s debut ended in a tie that almost seemed like a win.\n\nMurray and the Arizona Cardinals nearly finished an improbable comeback on Sunday in the rookie\u2019s debut, rallying from an 18-point deficit in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 24 in regulation.\n\nThe Cardinals had two chances to win in extra time and so did the Lions, but all they could do was trade field goals and settle for a 27-27 tie.\n\nIt was a strange ending to a thrilling game.\n\nArizona\u2019s new-look offense under first-year coach Kliff Kingsbury was a dud for most of the afternoon before inexplicably coming alive in the fourth quarter. Murray hit David Johnson for a 27-yard touchdown to pull the Cardinals within 24-16 with less than six minutes remaining.\n\nAfter the defense stopped the Lions, the top overall draft pick was at it again, leading a nine-play, 60-yard drive to a 4-yard touchdown throw to Larry Fitzgerald. Murray found Christian Kirk on the 2-point conversion to tie it with 43 seconds remaining.\n\nMurray was 15 of 19 for 154 yards and two touchdowns during the fourth-quarter comeback. Overall, he was 29 of 54 or 308 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nIt was a stunning collapse for Detroit, which looked totally in control until midway through the fourth period. The Lions took a 17-0 lead during the second quarter and had a 17-3 advantage at halftime.\n\nMatthew Stafford threw for 385 yards and three touchdowns for the Lions, but they couldn\u2019t put together drives in the fourth quarter to stop Arizona\u2019s momentum.\n\nLarry Fitzgerald, in his 16th NFL season, finished with eight catches for 113 yards.\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight year a game ended in a tie in the first week after the Browns and Steelers did the same thing last year.\n\nNICE GAME ROOKIE\n\nDetroit\u2019s T.J. Hockenson looks like he\u2019s ready to make an immediate impact in his rookie season. The 6-foot-5, 247-pound tight end, the No. 8 overall pick in April, was a problem for the Arizona secondary, creating mismatches all over the field. He finished with six catches for 131 yards and a touchdown.\n\nANOTHER ONE\n\nChandler Jones had Arizona\u2019s biggest play of the first quarter when he sacked Stafford, stripped the ball and recovered the fumble. Jones has 42 sacks in 49 career games with the Cardinals, including at least one sack in all four season openers since joining the franchise in 2016.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLions: plays its home opener against the Los Angeles Chargers, who also won in OT on Sunday.\n\nCardinals: goes on the road to face QB Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens, who looked very good in Week 1 in a lopsided win over Miami.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After all that drama, Kyler Murray's debut ended in a tie that almost seemed like a win.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Brandt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/lions_cardinals_football_78230_c0-176-4202-2625_s1770x1032.jpg?373f855019fa931ee8a629bd731b430542f04133", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
