While those events could produce a shift away from the current targeted, moderate stimulus regime, there have been few signals to date of any change.\n\nThe leaders are \u201clooking at a very long horizon,\u201d and that approach makes the headline growth rate - either above 6% or slightly below it - not that important, Yao Wei, chief China economist at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said in an interview on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings in Washington last week.\n\n\u201cThey measure the policy scope by looking at the overall debt, by looking at how much risk there is in shadow banking, in the housing sector and in inflation,\u201d Yao said. \u201cLooking at all these things, they judge they actually don\u2019t have much scope from a long-term perspective. So they\u2019re very careful about how to use it and when to use it.\u201d\n\n\n\nGrowth volatility is acceptable if other targets on employment, income and environmental protection are met, according to the top economic planning agency. China is facing downward pressure and challenges, but the country is able to meet major economic targets for this year, the National Development and Reform Commission\u2019s spokesman Yuan Da said Monday.\n\n\n\nIn the first three quarters of 2019, there were 10.97 million new urban jobs created, 99.7% of the target for the full year, according to the Statistics Bureau.\n\n\n\nWith few major monetary policy moves in the past month, the Loan Prime Rate, a market gauge of borrowing costs, remained unchanged in October, according to a PBOC release on Monday.\n\n\n\nIn his statement to the IMF\u2019s steering committee at the meetings, Yi said that growth had been stable this year and the \u201cmain economic indicators kept within an appropriate range.\u201d While keeping credit growing, the bank should also pay attention to \u201cmaintaining a stabilized leverage ratio,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nYi won support for China\u2019s approach from the IMF, which otherwise has been urging more action to support the global economy. Kenneth Kang, deputy director of the fund\u2019s Asia and Pacific Department, said any support to prop up the Chinese economy should be \u201ccontained, calibrated to the shock, it should be temporary in nature and it should be focusing on re-balancing growth down the road.\u201d\n\n\n\nStabilisation signs?\n\nEven though the third quarter growth numbers came in below estimates, policy makers may in fact be seeing signs of a stabilisation, particularly if the nascent trade-war truce with the US holds.\n\n\n\nCorporate demand for long-term credit picked up in recent months, the growth of auto sales - an important part of the country\u2019s retail sales - contracted less, and infrastructure investment stabilised at a low level. These factors are among those that have prompted economists from Citigroup, Barclays, Oversea-Chinese Banking, and Natwest Markets to cautiously call a bottoming-out.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe positive factors such as the trade truce, low base effect, the stabilisation of manufacturing sector and pickup of infrastructure investment may give the PBOC more reason to take a wait and see approach,\u201d Tommy Xie, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking, wrote in a note.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, if conditions were to worsen materially from here, China still has ample room to react, with interest rates far above zero. Before last week\u2019s growth data, economists surveyed by Bloomberg saw full-year expansion for 2019 coming in at 6.2% before slowing to 5.9% in 2020.\n\n\n\nFor now, the early signs of stabilisation give the authorities a chance to debate some long-term issues at the coming meetings, such as a graying population and the merits of freer internal migration of labour. These reforms could be more important than imminent policy loosening in ensuring a steady performance of the economy in the longer term.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways that China could manage its long-term demographic problems,\u201d Scott Kennedy, an expert on the US-China economic relationship at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThere are many things they could do, from eliminating the hukou system to delaying the retirement age to permitting inward immigration.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome of these topics are likely become the topics at the upcoming Party meetings.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wait for the upcoming Politburo meeting and a possible fourth Plenum for signals on the medium-term policy outlook,\u201d Liu Peiqian, China economist at Natwest Markets. \u201cIn particular we look for the Politburo\u2019s assessment about external uncertainties and how the authorities will balance their priorities of growth, deleveraging and stability.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s policy makers are preparing for two key policy meetings in the coming weeks with fresh evidence that sooner rather than later, the number for gross domestic product growth will start with a 5.", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/747/2e1ef56c042146bbb4dbd4fe0a0a7006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
