So get your camera rolling!\n\nThis sighting was captured by Alberto Scattolin, the 54-year-old owner and guide of Matimba Lodge. He enjoys going to the Kruger in the late afternoon to be on the lookout for new wildlife experiences.\n\nWATCH: Giraffe Struggles To Escape Crocodile's Jaws\n\nLast week, on the 7th of October, he witnessed this incredible sighting at Ngobeni Loop in the H14, which is a spot quite famous for its leopards. Alberto tells LatestSightings.com what happened:\n\n\u201cThis afternoon was no different than any other late afternoon drives in the Kruger. Usually, when I have no guests, I take a drive-by myself and try my luck to see if I can find some exciting sightings. On this specific day, I tried my luck once again and sure enough, it paid off!\n\n\n\n\u201cI arrived at this waterhole and spotted a crocodile feasting on a carcass in the water. But out of nowhere, a leopard appeared spotted the potential free meal. He immediately started approaching the water where the crocodile was.\n\nWATCH: Incredible Kruger dam scene plays out as hippos rescue wildebeest\n\n\u201cI stayed and watched as the hungry leopard tried to take the meal from the croc repeatedly. The croc had none of it though and protected the meal by lashing out at the leopard with snapping jaws each time it came close enough to almost become a meal itself. I\u2019ve seen a similar situation before, but never anything as intense as this.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was the only person at this spot at the time, hence, it made this an unbelievable experience, it was like an exclusive performance for a sole audience. The sighting ended when I had to leave since the gates were about to close. This was the most amazing interaction with these two animals I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love the Kruger, and I hope to see more people having similar and even better sightings to share. When you\u2019re in the Kruger and you get to a sighting like this, enjoy it while it lasts, because you never know if you will ever see anything like that again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
