The somber first episode acts as both a respectful homage to the beloved actor, who played Archie\u2019s dad Fred Andrews in the show\u2019s first three seasons until suffering a fatal stroke in February, and as a way to explain his character\u2019s sudden absence.\n\nThe serious tone of the episode means none of the usual unrealistic, delightfully-absurd antics that make the show fun to watch, from a cheerleading squad breaking into juvie to perform \u201cJailhouse Rock\u201d for the inmates to the time that Archie wore a bowtie to his murder trial. Instead, Season 4 picks up during the surprisingly uneventful summer before Archie\u2019s (KJ Apa) senior year of high school. He and his friends, Jughead (Cole Sprouse), Betty (Lili Reinhart), and Veronica (Camila Mendes), are enjoying the peaceful respite from investigating murders and sparring with mob bosses. They\u2019re making plans to go camping when Archie receives the news that his father has died.\n\nWithout spoiling the details of Fred\u2019s death, I can disclose that he gets into an accident that reaffirms his characterization on the show as a selfless and humble local hero. The rest of the episode will undoubtedly leave viewers misty-eyed, as Archie and co. struggle to come to terms with the reality of the tragedy and make preparations for the funeral. In one particularly moving scene, the town\u2019s annual Fourth of July parade is converted into a celebration of Fred Andrews.\n\nThe townspeople line the streets to greet Fred\u2019s hearse, wielding red, white and blue signs with messages like \u201cWelcome Home Fred\u201d and \u201cAlways in Our Hearts.\u201d Even the self-involved bully Cheryl Blossom, played by Madelaine Petsch, pitches in by funding a fireworks show. It is undeniably sentimental, but moving, nonetheless.\n\nThe sincere grief of the actors, many of whom were close with Perry, elevates the premiere beyond a sappy attempt to pull at heartstrings, in spite of the fact that earnestness is not the typical or natural approach of a show like Riverdale. When Archie, while delivering a eulogy at the funeral, says, \u201cFred Andrews will always be a part of Riverdale,\u201d you can just as easily imagine swapping in Perry\u2019s name. Petsch\u2019s face is contorted with sobs when she, as Cheryl, lays a red rose on the casket and Ashleigh Monique Murray, who plays Josie, delivers a stirring a capella rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the cast members have taken to social media to share messages honoring the deceased actor ahead of the premiere. Lili Reinhart shared three group portraits featuring Perry on Instagram with the caption, \u201cTonight\u2019s episode, and all of episodes for the rest of our run, are for Luke. We love, honor, and cherish his memory every single day. I only wish he were here to see how many lives he touched with happiness and laughter. I know he\u2019s watching from above. We love you, Luke.\u201d Madelaine Petsch similarly posted a photo of herself and her late co-star with a lengthy caption about his role as a mentor on set. Perry, she wrote, \u201cwas always so generous and supportive and patient.\u201d\n\nRiverdale has a well-established trend of casting famous actors from \u201880s and \u201890s teen dramas, beginning with Perry\u2014a simultaneous nod to the shows and films that laid the groundwork for the genre, as well as an act of hopeful foreshadowing that its young, relatively unknown stars will become household names like their predecessors. The other Riverdale parents include M\u00e4dchen Amick (Twin Peaks), Skeet Ulrich (Scream), and John Hughes teen queen Molly Ringwald. Last season, Chad Michael Murray, though of a slightly younger generation of high-school heartthrobs, joined the cast as a dad-turned-sadistic cult leader. And in the newest episode, Perry\u2019s Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Shannen Doherty makes an unexpected appearance\u2014the first of what will surely be many twists in the upcoming season.", "description": "The fourth season premiere of CW\u2019s \u201cRiverdale,\u201d titled \u201cIn Memoriam,\u201d saw the teen drama honoring the death of cast member Luke Perry, who passed away in February.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570663161/191008-leon-riverdale-tease_g2u908", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
