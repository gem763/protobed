But there's one that didn't get any air time which potentially could be interesting to businesses: Another model of the Surface Laptop 3.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft officials touted two new Surface Laptop 3 models during the company's fall hardware event: A 13.5-inch Laptop 3 running Intel's 10th-generation Core \"Ice Lake\" and a 15-inch Laptop 3 running a customized AMD Ryzen processor developed in tandem by Microsoft and AMD. But there also is a 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 that will run Intel's Core \"Ice Lake\" processor.\n\n\n\nThe Intel-based 15-inch model is available to business customers through a set of preapproved Surface business partners. Microsoft is not making the AMD-based 15-inch Surface available to business customers through these channels. (If you happen to be a business customer who wants the AMD-based 15-inch Surface Laptop 3, you can just buy it outside of the Surface business channels.)\n\nMicrosoft says Surface Laptop 3 will get up to 11.5 hours of battery life. It's configurable with up to 32GB of RAM. Pricing starts at $1,099. Microsoft has made the Alcantara-covered keyboard optional; metal keyboards are now offered, as well. Surface Laptop 3 is slated to begin shipping on October 22.", "description": "Microsoft is offering business users a version of its just-announced 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 with Intel inside.", "authors": ["Mary Jo Foley"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/03/9a6f36b5-a545-48a6-8aac-2cec3e447a11/thumbnail/770x578/56b231fa29787ef9d0e62fc8197c95b4/surfacelaptop3intelbased.jpg"}
