And they said Mr. Pence\u2019s Ireland visit is fishy because it prompted an awkward, 180-mile commute to business meetings in Dublin and was accompanied by shifting explanations.\n\nAides initially said Mr. Trump suggested the stay, though Mr. Pence\u2019s team later took full responsibility for the decision.\n\nIn his tweets, Mr. Trump said Mr. Pence stayed at his Irish resort because it was the best option for the vice president\u2019s stop on the country\u2019s western coast.\n\n\u201cMike\u2019s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
