But now we suspect that this is not necessarily the case.\"\n\n\"We are now seeing these injections can be very harmful to the joints with serious complications.\"\n\nHe said patients contemplating such injections should be given more information about potential risks.\n\n\"What we wanted to do with our paper is to tell physicians and patients to be careful, because these injections are likely not as safe as we thought.\"\n\nThe findings appear online in the journal Radiology.\n\nThe NHS provides the injections for those suffering moderate to severe osteoarthritis and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and it is also used in sports medicine.\n\nDr Guermazi said: \"Physicians do not commonly tell patients about the possibility of joint collapse or subchondral insufficiency fractures that may lead to earlier total hip or knee replacement. This information should be part of the consent when you inject patients with intra-articular corticosteroids.\"\n\nResearchers said patients with little sign of osteoarthritis on their X-rays should be particularly closely monitored, if the pain they were experiencing was disproportionate to evidence on the scan. Such patients are at greater risk of destructive arthritis after injections, they said.", "description": "Cortisone\u00a0injections for hip and knee pain lead to more complications than previously thought, research has found.\u00a0 The anti-inflammatory jabs are used by athletes to mask pain, and to treat symptoms of osteoarthritis.
