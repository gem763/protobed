Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Several Democrats running for president in 2020 support some version of Medicare for all.", "authors": ["Gerald Friedman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x42RyriIJSVmDUde84YG3g--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/192bdd8fb4dde851a4a0f4bf93493831", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
