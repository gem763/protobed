Summit", "language": "en", "text": "(BRUSSELS) \u2014 European Union and British negotiators failed to reach a breakthrough in Brexit talks during a frantic all-night session and will continue seeking a compromise on the eve of Thursday\u2019s crucial EU summit.\n\nAn EU official, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations were still ongoing, said Wednesday that \u201cdiscussions continued until late in the night and will continue today.\u201d\n\nBoth sides were hoping that after more than three years of false starts and sudden reversals, a clean divorce deal for Britain leaving the bloc might be sketched out within the coming hours.\n\nEven though many questions remain, diplomats made it clear that both sides were within touching distance of a deal for the first time since a U.K. withdrawal plan fell apart in the British House of Commons in March.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But once Britain exits, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure.\n\nThe big question is how far Johnson\u2019s government is prepared to budge on its insistence that the U.K., including Northern Ireland, must leave the European Union\u2019s customs union \u2014 something that would require checks on goods passing between the U.K. and the EU, including on the island of Ireland. Ireland and other EU members say any checks in Ireland are unacceptable.\n\nThe alternative is to have checks between Britain and Northern Ireland. But Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, the party that props up Johnson\u2019s minority government, strongly opposes any measures that could loosen the bonds between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nEven if there is a deal, it must be passed by both European lawmakers and Britain\u2019s Parliament, which rejected \u2014 three times \u2014 the agreement struck by his predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nPro-Brexit Conservative lawmaker David Davis said success rests on the stance of the DUP.\n\nHe said that \u201cif the DUP says \u2018this is intolerable to us\u2019 that will be quite important.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s EU leaders\u2019 meeting \u2014 the last scheduled summit before the Brexit deadline \u2014 was long considered the last opportunity to approve a divorce agreement. Johnson insists his country will leave at the end of the month with or without an agreement, although U.K. lawmakers are determined to push for another delay rather than risk a chaotic no-deal Brexit.\n\nThey have passed a law that compels the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit if there is no deal in place by Saturday.\n\nJohnson insists he won\u2019t do that \u2014 but also says he will obey the law. It\u2019s unclear how the two statements can be reconciled.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "European Union and British negotiators were hoping to sketch out a clean divorce deal for Britain leaving the bloc.", "authors": ["Raf Casert", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brexit-talks-fail-eu-summit.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C5239px%2C2742px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
