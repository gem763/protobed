Highs: Mid-80s.\n\nTonight: Mostly clear. Lows: Mid-60s to near 70.\n\nTomorrow: Mostly to partly sunny. Highs: Mid- to upper 80s.\n\nView the weather at Washington Post headquarters.\n\nFORECAST IN DETAIL\n\nThese days, it often seems hard to get rid of summer. That\u2019s the story for the near future around here. Since average highs are approaching the mid-70s, it\u2019s more difficult to get it to be truly hot, but at least a few days ahead should try for that consideration. At least beach and pool (if it\u2019s still open) season is extended?\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

We\u2019re right on the cusp of the Nice Day stamp requirements on temperature, but since it\u2019s Saturday, I\u2019ll lean friendly. There\u2019s a very small chance a shower or storm trickles out of the mountains late in western suburbs but don\u2019t bet on it. Winds are from the south around 5 to 10 mph. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: Mostly clear skies rule. With humidity levels up somewhat, temperatures don\u2019t fall as much as recent on nights. Lows are mainly in the range of mid-60s to near 70. Winds are light after sunset. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates.

Skies are again partly to mostly sunny, with only an outside shot at some precipitation coming in off the mountains to the west. With dew points into the mid-60s and highs in the mid- and upper 80s, it\u2019ll feel like 90s in the afternoon. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTomorrow night: Skies are partly cloudy and temperatures range from the upper 60s to the lower 70s in most spots. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nConditions are similar to tomorrow by Monday. An approaching cold front may increase the clouds, especially in the afternoon, when some showers or storms may pass through. Highs range from the mid-80s to around 90. Confidence: Medium\n\nWe\u2019ll get a taste of weather that is more typical for late September, although it may still be on the warm side Tuesday. Highs range from the upper 70s to lower 80s, and the day will be sun-dominated. Humidity should be low.
