That said, some users have posted videos like the one above showing that it\u2019s possible to unlock an S10 by placing a specific kind of gel case on top of the sensor, even on a phone with freshly registered fingerprints, essentially allowing these gel cases to act as a sort of master key.\n\nThe unfortunate thing for Samsung is that ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensors like the one in Galaxy S10 are generally regarded as being more accurate and secure than optical in-display fingerprint sensors like the ones used in the OnePlus 7 Pro and OnePlus 7T.\n\nAt launch, some Galaxy S10 owners complained that the phone\u2019s in-display fingerprint sensor was a bit too sensitive, which sometimes required users to tap their fingers on the phone\u2019s screen multiple times in order to unlock the device. This later prompted Samsung to send out a patch that adjusted the sensitivity of the S10's fingerprint sensor and made unlocking the phone easier, but it may have also been the cause for this phone\u2019s recent issue with silicone covers.\n\nSo remember, if you\u2019re really concerned about people hacking into your phone, maintaining physical security of your gadgets is still a crucial way to protect yourself. And if you see people walking around with suspicious-looking gel pads, you might want to keep on eye on them too.", "description": "After a British couple discovered that their Galaxy S10 could be unlocked by anyone\u2019s fingerprints, Samsung has now provided an official statement explaining the issue and advising late model Galaxy phone owners on what to do....", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "George Dvorsky"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dlg8kzgcsimdnyenojl3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
