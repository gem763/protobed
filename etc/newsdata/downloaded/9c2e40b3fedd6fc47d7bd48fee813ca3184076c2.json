Chapman is joined by his team of hunters or \u201cThe Dirty Dozen,\u201d along with Beth during the final months of her life.\n\nDOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER HONORS HIS LATE WIFE BETH IN NEW SHOW: 'SHE'S STILL HERE WITH ME'\n\nBeth passed away in June at the age 51 after a lengthy battle with cancer. Chapman told Fox News that Beth didn\u2019t think twice about sharing her private ordeal with audiences.\n\n\u201cI freaked out at some of the stuff she showed,\u201d Chapman admitted. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Honey, are you sure?\u2019 She said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019 Her goal was to beat this thing and to show people how to do it. Of course, she didn\u2019t, cancer won, but she wanted to show her fans, her family and everybody what to do if something like this should happen to them. I was amazed at some of the stuff she showed the camera.\u201d\n\nRADIO HOST DELILAH SAYS FAITH \u2018SAVED MY SANITY\u2019 AFTER SHE LOST TWO SONS: \u2018I DID THE BEST THAT I COULD\u2019\n\nBeth was first diagnosed with stage 2 throat cancer in November 2017. She underwent successful surgery, but doctors told her months later the cancer had returned. Although she began chemotherapy last December, Chapman told Us Weekly at the time that she wanted to explore alternative therapies instead.\n\nIn April, she was admitted to a hospital in Hawaii with \u201cserious breathing issues,\u201d but recovered. In June, she was rushed again to the ER and placed in a medically induced coma. Sources told TMZ that Beth was having trouble breathing due to her throat cancer and described the incident as a \u201cchoking emergency.\u201d\n\nChapman said that despite Beth\u2019s health deteriorating, she was determined to be by her family\u2019s side, further building their bounty business.\n\nBETH CHAPMAN \u2018CHOKED ON CANCER\u2019 IN FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS, DAUGHTER SAYS\n\n\u201cWhen I first started dating Beth about 31 years ago, I had a skinhead break my nose,\u201d Chapman recalled. \u201cI cuffed him and I was in his face calling him names and he head-butted me \u2014 I\u2019ve learned not to call names or get in a skinhead\u2019s face since then. But I came home\u2026 She\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 Blood everywhere. Of course, the old saying was, what does the other guy look like? I go, \u2018Listen, pretty bad.\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018Sure.\u2019 She went with me to the next bust.\u201d\n\n\"In my heart, I always knew Beth would be my forever wife.\" \u2014 Duane \"Dog\" Chapman\n\nFRANCO COLUMBU DEAD: BODYBUILDER, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BEST FRIEND WAS 78\n\n\u201cShe wanted to be there all the time to make sure the stories I told her were true,\u201d Chapman continued. \u201cShe would not let me go anywhere by myself ever. She hung with me\u2026 I think out of the 30 plus years, there were maybe seven to eight days when we were apart during something--oh, when I was in jail in Mexico. That was the longest we were ever apart. Her being right by my side...was Beth and she wasn\u2019t going to let cancer stop that. She was going out there with the family and with me.\u201d\n\nWhile Chapman is still grieving the loss of his beloved wife, he said the show must go on. Since becoming a bounty hunter, Chapman has captured more than 5,000 fugitives and has been involved in several well-publicized hunts, including the search for UFC fighter War Machine, as well as escapees from the Dannemora Prison break in 2013.\n\nDOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER URGES STORE BURGLAR TO SURRENDER: I'M 'COMING FOR YOU'\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using a lot of sophisticated equipment to capture the fugitives now, and we\u2019re also training a lot of different law enforcement that sees us how we\u2019re doing it,\u201d explained Chapman. \"It\u2019s a challenge, to be able to capture [these criminals], but once you do, it\u2019s more of a reward. Deep down inside you feel like you did a very good. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, the good guy versus the bad guy.\u201d\n\n\u201c[And] it\u2019s in our blood,\u201d continued Chapman about the series. \u201cWe just love it. We love to do this. I\u2019m so happy and I\u2019m so proud. I love to entertain people and make them cry and laugh. It\u2019s just in my DNA.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, \u201cDog the Bounty Hunter\u201d originally premiered on A&E, launching the couple into reality TV stardom.\n\nAfter several years together building their bail and bounty business, Duane proposed to Beth in 2005 in Las Vegas, where they almost tied the knot but were too late to the courthouse. They ended up marrying in May 2006, but the wedding was bittersweet: The day before their big day, Duane's daughter, Barbara Katy Chapman, died in a car accident near her Alaska home.\n\nDIRECTOR OF JESSI COMBS' FINAL FILM SAYS MOVIE WILL BE DEDICATED TO HER: 'SHE WILL BE MISSED BY ALL'\n\nAs for what made them finally marry, Chapman wrote in his book \"Where Mercy Is Shown, Mercy Is Given:\" \"Our youngest children had begun to ask us why we weren't married, and Beth was being referred to as my 'life partner' or 'sidekick.' Those descriptions weren't fair to her, either. In my heart, I always knew Beth would be my forever wife. It was time to make it official.\"\n\nChapman previously told Fox News of his wife's cancer battle, \"Faith is probably the No. 1 thing in our lives, no matter what we\u2019re faced with ... Through this cancer episode, we had to drum up as much faith as we could.\"\n\n\"And the Bible talks about having faith as small as a mustard seed,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s not much ... And I thank God that we had at least that much faith to get her through that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBeth is survived by Chapman, their children Bonnie Jo and Garry, her daughter Cecily, several grandchildren and a great-grandson, as well as son Dominic Davis from a prior relationship.\n\n\"Dog's Most Wanted\" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on WGN.", "description": "Duane \u201cDog\u201d Chapman is honoring the memory of his late wife Beth Chapman the only way he knows how \u2014 by catching bad guys.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco", "Duane", "Dog"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/30/694940094001_6080514919001_6080508042001-vs.jpg"}
