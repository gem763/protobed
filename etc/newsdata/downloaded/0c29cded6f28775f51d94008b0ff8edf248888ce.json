For the first time since the Bank of Canada began fixing the date of its interest rate announcements in late 2000, we have rate decisions scheduled from the BoC and the Fed on the same day on Wednesday, writes BMO economist Doug Porter.\n\n\u201cImagine if the Super Bowl, the World Series, the Stanley Cup, and Wimbledon finals were all scheduled in the same 24-hour period.

Play resumes with the release of the U.S. GDP and employment numbers on Wednesday. Canadian GDP for August and important macroeconomic data and a Bank of Japan meeting comes down the pipe on Thursday.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s another big week for earnings this week, with 164 S&P500 companies and another 263 corporate earnings events on the Canadian exchanges.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know this morning:\n\nIn Banff, Royce Chwin, CEO, Travel Alberta will discuss what the industry needs to do differently to grow provincial tourism revenue to $20 billion by 2030\n\nA federal-provincial-industry consortium discusses start-up clean energy company G4 Insights Inc. and how it converts wood into renewable natural gas in Edmonton\n\nSyncrude Managing Director Doreen Cole to announce Syncrude achieving a major production milestone\n\nCarbon Positive Clean Technology conference in Edmonton\n\nNotable Earnings: Restaurant Brands International Inc., Capital Power Corp, PrairieSky Royalty Ltd First Quantum Minerals Ltd, Hexo Corp., Alphabet\n\nThe outlook is upbeat for housing in Canada next year with construction starts, sales and prices expected to rebound on the back of economic and demographic support, according to the country\u2019s largest public mortgage provider.\n\nHousing starts will range between 194,000 and 204,300 next year, showing a return to form after two years of declines, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said in its annual housing market outlook, writes Colin McClelland.\n\n\u2014 Please send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014 Yadullah Hussain @yad_Fpenergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/posthasteoct-28-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
