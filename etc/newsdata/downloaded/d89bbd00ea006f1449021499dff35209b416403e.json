Southwest, the biggest operator of the plane, has dropped the Max from its schedule through Jan. 5.\n\nJon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said the union has been uncomfortable with Southwest\u2019s timetable.\n\n\u201cOn our side, we think we\u2019re looking at maybe even February or March,\u201d he said during a meeting of pilot-union representatives from several airlines.\n\nSouthwest spokeswoman Brandy King said the airline is waiting for more information from federal regulators about timing of the plane\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cWe continue our work on schedule revisions but do not have any new information on timing for MAX return to service,\u201d she said.\n\nBoeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said, \u201cWhile the decision is up to the regulators, we continue to work towards return to service of the MAX in the fourth quarter of this year.\u201d\n\nBoeing is making changes to the Max\u2019s flight-control computers and rewriting software that mistakenly activated on flights in Indonesia last October and Ethiopia in March, pushing the noses of the planes down based on faulty sensor readings. The changes are intended to make the automated software, called MCAS, less powerful and easier for pilots to control.\n\nGreg Bowen, Southwest pilots\u2019 union chairman for training matters, said even after that work is done, the Federal Aviation Administration will need to decide what type of pilot training will be needed before the planes fly again. He said the FAA is considering revising a half-dozen pilot checklists related to MCAS and flight-control computers, which he said would take at least 30 days.\n\nThe FAA declined to comment.\n\nJohn DeLeeuw, safety chairman of the pilots\u2019 union at American Airlines, said American plans to fly two of its grounded Max jets from storage in New Mexico to its maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, this week or next week. The airline will need FAA permission for the flights.\n\nDeLeeuw said American wants to perform maintenance on the jets, \u201cbut also to see how the airplanes are flying after being in the desert for six, seven months.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pilot-union leaders at Southwest Airlines say it could be February or March before their airline resumes flights using the Boeing 737 Max.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Koenig"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
