The film takes its title from Victor Hugo\u2019s classic novel about popular rebellion and follows three policemen overrun by an angry mob during the 2005 Paris riots.\n\nThe riots, which took place in the city\u2019s poorer suburbs, were led by youths of mainly African heritage in protest of high unemployment and a perceived culture of police harassment.\n\n\u201cThe background of my story is a very violent situation,\u201d Ly explained. \u201cI really emphasize that I don\u2019t accept or support violence, but sometimes it cannot be helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pro-violence, but sometimes violence can help you to obtain things. You can see that in history, for example, with the French Revolution,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was the violence that made the French Revolution succeed. Also, in 2005 you had the revolt in the Paris suburbs.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has been subject to widespread political and civil unrest since early June, when pro-democracy activists began taking to the streets to oppose an extradition bill that would have permitted criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial.\n\nThe bill has since been scrapped by Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam, although the protests have since merged into wider demonstrations against police brutality, with participants demanding the release of over 1,000 detainees.\n\nThe movement is also part of a wider pushback against Beijing\u2019s increasing interference in the region\u2019s internal affairs, undermining the principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d that was signed following the handover from the British Empire in 1997.\n\n\u201cI think we have seen in history how you begin with talk and if the talk doesn\u2019t work it moves to violence,\u201d concluded Ly. \u201cYou saw in France in 2005 that there were talks at the start but when the talks went nowhere the people became violent. It was only at that time that the government became interested.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Celebrated Les Mis\u00e9rables\u00a0director\u00a0Ladj Ly has expressed\u00a0his support for the ongoing anti-communist China demonstrations in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/LadjLy1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
