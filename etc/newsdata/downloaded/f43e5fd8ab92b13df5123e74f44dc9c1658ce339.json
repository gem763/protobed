(AP) \u2014 Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox is a low-key retired school teacher who hasn't faced serious competition since the first President Bush was in office.\n\nNow he's a top target of Democrats \u2014both in and out of state\u2014 looking to capitalize on voter antipathy toward the current resident of the White House.\n\nAttack ads accusing Cox of being a shill for special interests are all over the airwaves in his Richmond-area district. His opponent is raking in cash while trying to paint Cox as a crony of President Donald Trump.\n\nVirginia's legislative elections in November have become the marquee warmup for the 2020 election cycle \u2014 an early gauge of Democratic enthusiasm and Republican resilience in a state once considered a presidential battleground.\n\nThe races are more than just bellwethers. Virginia has become a test run for the parties' massive, expensive campaigns to win the redistricting wars. The state legislature elected in November \u2014 like many legislatures elected next year across the country \u2014 will help decide who redraws congressional maps. The fight has drawn big money and attention to races often overlooked in the past.\n\nSeveral 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have made stops in Virginia, and more are expected before Election Day. GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein recently gave $500,000 to a Republican House candidate, one of the biggest single donations to a political candidate in state history.\n\nFor Cox, this year has meant trying to hold on to his own seat while raising millions for both his race and to help his caucus.\n\n\"I'm just trying to work very, very hard at it,\" he said.\n\nCox's opponent, Sheila Bynum-Coleman, recently had one of the biggest fundraising hauls of any candidate in the state and has several high-profile endorsements from advocacy groups spending unprecedented amounts on state legislative contests, including the Human Rights Campaign and Emily's List.\n\nFour states have legislatives elections this year, but only Virginia's holds the promise of a seismic power shift. Democrats in the Old Dominion have a shot of winning control of the statehouse, which would give them control of both houses of the legislature and the governor's office for the first time in more than two decades.\n\nThat would be the culmination of the state's rapid political transformation. Demographic shifts and population growth in the Washington suburbs have weakened the political influence of the state's conservative, rural areas. Republicans have not won a statewide election in a decade but have managed to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers of the legislature.\n\nVoters unhappy with President Donald Trump, particularly in suburban areas, have helped accelerate the shift. Democrats surprised even themselves with how well they did in 2017, picking up 15 seats in the state House. The outcome was viewed as an early indicator of the national Democratic surge in the suburbs in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nImpeachment efforts by U.S. House Democrats have put a renewed focus on the Trump presidency just ahead of next month's elections. It's unclear what effect that will have in Virginia, but polls have consistently shown Trump with a low approval rating in the state.\n\nThese off-year legislative elections when there no statewide candidates running typically favor Republicans, but Democrats have other forces working in their favor.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that found the GOP-led Virginia House illegally packed black voters into certain districts when they drew legislative boundaries in 2011, helping Republicans who lived in nearby districts.\n\nThe new map helps Democrats and dramatically shifts the partisan dynamics in several districts that were once safely Republican. Two of the state's most powerful Republicans, Cox and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Chris Jones, saw some of the biggest partisan and demographic swings.\n\nTheir new districts now include more inner suburban and urban precincts and fewer rural ones. African Americans now make up a third of Cox's district, up from 18 percent. Jones now represents a Hampton Roads district that is half African American, up from about a quarter.\n\n\"I do think (the new map) was targeting senior (Republican) members. Having said that, that's over. I'm very happy with my district and I'm going to work my district hard \u2014 always do,\" Cox said.", "description": "Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox is a low-key retired school teacher who hasn't faced serious competition since the first President Bush was in office.
