Now He's Pleading Guilty Just to Walk Free.", "language": "en", "text": "Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nA 62-year-old Louisiana man has been locked up in one of the country\u2019s most infamous prisons for 42 years over a deadly armed robbery he said he didn\u2019t commit. Now he\u2019s pleading guilty so he can walk free, his attorneys say.\n\nIn exchange for pleading guilty to manslaughter and three counts of armed robbery, Elvis Brooks leaves prison Wednesday with a felony criminal record that bars him from ever returning to a completely normal life, according to the Innocence Project New Orleans, the organization that pressed for another hearing of his case.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a deal he sought, either, his attorney Charell Arnold, told VICE News. But pushing to clear him of the charges entirely could\u2019ve taken years, if not a decade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger. I\u2019d like to get out,\u201d Brooks told NOLA.com.\n\nBrooks was 19 in July 1977, when two armed men robbed a local bar and killed a patron. Brooks had an alibi for that night \u2014 and 12 other people to back up his account, according to Arnold. Nonetheless, he was named as the suspect, sentenced to life in prison, and spent much of the next 42 years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the nation\u2019s largest maximum-security prison notorious for being built on the site of a former slave plantation.\n\n\u201cThe only reason that Elvis Brooks became a suspect in this case was because he was African-American man who lived in this particular neighborhood,\u201d Arnold, who maintains that he\u2019s innocent, said.\n\nArnold said the witnesses who later identified Brooks as the suspect were merely \u201cwhite strangers\u201d who saw a robbery and homicide occur in a \u201cdimly lit bar\u201d after drinking all day.\n\n\n\nThe Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office, meanwhile, has maintained that Brooks was fairly identified in a line-up that year by three separate witnesses, one of whom previously recognized Brooks from around their neighborhood. Additionally, Brooks\u2019 original sentence was held up through several appeals, since he\u2019s been fighting his imprisonment for decades now.\n\n\"Mr. Brooks committed a murder and multiple armed robberies in 1977, and his conviction and sentence were properly attained and affirmed through the course of several appeals,\u201d Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe took another look at the case after 42 years, and remain convinced this office did nothing then or now to deprive this defendant of a fair trial.\u201d\n\nInstead, Cannizzaro continued, the district attorney concluded he was \u201cworthy of new sentencing consideration.\u201d\n\nIPNO had asked for a new hearing on Brooks\u2019 case after they found prosecutors and police may have violated the so-called Brady doctrine, which keeps prosecutors from improperly withholding evidence that can help a defendant\u2019s case. Arnold said fingerprints obtained from beer cans allegedly held by the robbers that night didn\u2019t match with Brooks\u2019 prints, but that this information wasn\u2019t disclosed to his attorney.\n\nAdditionally, another armed robbery took place just around the corner from the bar where a man was killed on that July 1977 night, about an hour before the event Brooks was blamed for. Brooks was not identified as a suspect in that other, close crime, however.\n\nBrooks\u2019 case is effectively closed now that he\u2019s taken the plea deal, Arnold said. Having pleaded guilty, he won\u2019t be able to pursue cash through Louisiana\u2019s Innocence Compensation Fund, which is afforded to people who are wrongfully convicted of a crime. The legal group says that it will soon post a fundraiser for him, as it does for many of its clients.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, he will be released with a criminal record, he has no ability to seek compensation,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cFor all of those 42 years, the state owes him nothing.\u201d\n\nCover: Elvis Brooks before his arrest with his sister, Earline Brooks Colbert.
