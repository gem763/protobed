Tulsi Gabbard, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has changed course on her opinion of the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nUp until Friday, Gabbard was one of the few House Democrats to oppose her caucus' move to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, sparked by a whistleblower complaint against the president regarding his interactions with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn a statement, Gabbard said that she has changed her mind after reviewing the latest developments in the Ukraine story, including the release of a summary of the phone call Trump had with Zelensky and the declassified whistleblower complaint.\n\n\"[U]nfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent,\" Gabbard said Friday. \"Future presidents, as well as anyone in positions of power in the government, will conclude that they can abuse their position for personal gain, without fear of accountability or consequences.\"\n\nRead: The full declassified text of the Trump whistleblower complaint\n\nMore: How GOP lawmakers are responding to the whistleblower complaint\n\n\"So it is unfortunate, but necessary, that I speak in support of the inquiry into the President\u2019s alleged abuse of power in relation to his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s leaders,\" Gabbard said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate U.S. representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii speaks during the second night of the Democratic presidential debates at the Fox Theatre in Detroit on Tuesday, July 31, 2019. More\n\nIn order to proceed to a Senate impeachment trial, a majority of House members must vote to recommend articles of impeachment. Democrats, who are a majority in the House, exceed the 218 votes that are required. According to recent tallies of impeachment supporters, Democrats appear to have enough support.\n\nNot all House Democrats are on board, though. CNN reported there are still 12 who haven't committed after Gabbard's announcement.\n\n\"Hyperpartisanship is one of the main things that is driving our country apart,\" Gabbard said on Tuesday of her opposition to impeachment. \"I think it's important to defeat Donald Trump, that's why I'm running for president, but I think it's the American people who need to make their voices heard in making that decision.\"\n\nGabbard's announcement also comes after another Democrat running for her seat in Congress slammed her for her position. Kai Kahele, a state senator, said that Trump's rhetoric is divisive, impeachment isn't, while calling for donations to his campaign.\n\nGabbard repeated her opposition to divisiveness on Friday, calling for the impeachment probe to be \"swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused.\"\n\n\"It cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus that will further divide our country and undermine our democracy,\" Gabbard said.\n\nMore: Donald Trump's wary White House deals with the threat of impeachment\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Impeachment: Democrat Tulsi Gabbard changes mind, now supports inquiry", "description": "Rep.
