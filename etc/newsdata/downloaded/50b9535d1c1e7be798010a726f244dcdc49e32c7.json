(AP Photo/Felipe Dana)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests (all times local):\n\n2 a.m. Saturday\n\nA Hong Kong police official says a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh during widespread demonstrations against a ban on face masks.\n\nHe says police are trying to verify if the boy was hit by a stray bullet or shot by a police officer who fired his gun after being attacked by a large group of protesters Friday night.\n\nThe official requested anonymity because he isn't authorized to speak to the news media.\n\nThe Hospital Authority says a 14-year-old boy was hospitalized in serious condition. The authority didn't provide details.\n\nThe teen is the second victim of gunfire this week and since pro-democracy protests began in June. A riot officer shot an 18-year-old youth at close range during widespread violence Tuesday.\n\nA government statement said a plainclothes officer fired a single shot in self-defense Friday night after a large group of protesters attacked him in the northern Yuen Long district.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nA Chinese spokesman for Hong Kong affairs says the \"chaotic situation\" in the semi-autonomous region cannot be allowed to continue endlessly and more effective measures are needed to stem protests.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency quoted Yang Guang as saying Friday that Beijing supports Hong Kong's use of emergency powers to ban masks at rallies. Yang expressed confidence in Chief Executive Carrie Lam's ability to handle the situation amid speculation Beijing could intervene.\n\nYang said the \"chaotic situation in Hong Kong cannot continue endlessly,\" and that \"it has come to a crucial moment to end violence and chaos with a more clear-cut attitude and more effective measures.\"\n\nHe said the situation in Hong Kong had evolved to directly challenge government authority under \"the intervention of external forces.\"\n\n___\n\n7:20 p.m.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the Hong Kong government should turn to political dialogue instead of aggravating tensions in monthslong pro-democracy protests.\n\nIn a statement issued Friday after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers to ban protesters from wearing masks in all public gatherings, Raab said \"political dialogue is the only way to resolve the situation in Hong Kong.\"\n\nRaab said Lam's administration needs to ensure public security and safety, but \"must avoid aggravating and instead reduce tensions.\"\n\nThe emergency ordinance is a relic of British colonial rule and was last used in 1967 to quell riots before the territory returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\n___\n\n6:20 p.m.\n\nThousands of protesters in masks are streaming into Hong Kong streets after the territory's leader invoked rarely used emergency powers to ban masks at rallies.\n\nImmediately defying the ban set to take force Saturday, chanting protesters are cramming streets in the central business district and elsewhere, the majority wearing masks of the type that will be outlawed in gatherings from midnight.\n\n___\n\n5:20 p.m.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam should quit over months-long pro-democracy protests and predicts Beijing would send its military to end the crisis.\n\nMahathir, the world's oldest leader at 94, says Lam \"is in a dilemma\" as she is caught between obeying China's ruling Communist Party and trying to appease angry citizens.\n\nSpeaking in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, Mahathir said: \"She has to obey the masters (but) at the same time, she has to ask her conscience. Her conscience says the people of Hong Kong are right in rejecting the law.\"\n\nMahathir says that for Lam, the \"best thing is to resign.\"\n\nJust like China sent the military to crush the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in Beijing, Mahathir says, \"I think in the end, that is what China will do\" in Hong Kong.\n\n___\n\n4:55 p.m.\n\nA government document detailing the mask ban at Hong Kong protests that will be enforced Saturday says it will not just cover unauthorized or illegal assemblies but also apply to gatherings approved by police.\n\nThe document was given to reporters during Chief Executive Carrie Lam's news conference.\n\nSecretary of Security John Lee Ka-Chiu says the ban covers any procession with over 30 people and assemblies of more than 50 people.\n\nLam, who attended China's National Day festivities in Beijing this week, says the ban was her own government's decision, not an order from Beijing. She also reiterated she won't quit, saying her departure wouldn't resolve the crisis.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A Hong Kong police official says a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh during widespread demonstrations against a ban on face masks.
