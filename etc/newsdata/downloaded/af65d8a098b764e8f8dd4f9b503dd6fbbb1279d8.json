They are: centre Frans Steyn, loose forward Francois Louw, locks Franco Mostert and RG Snyman and prop Vincent Koch.\n\nNine of the team that defeated Namibia 57-3 in City of Toyota in the preceding match regain a starting place while Damian Willemse \u2013 who arrived as an injury replacement from the UK on Thursday \u2013 goes straight into the starting line-up at fullback.\n\nThere are also first starts at the Rugby World Cup for prop Thomas du Toit and scrumhalf Cobus Reinach.\n\nA win with a bonus point would almost certainly secure a place in the quarter-finals for the Springboks.\n\n\u201cA four-day turnaround between Tests is a challenge but we had planned for it and will be well prepared,\u201d said Rassie Erasmus, South Africa\u2019s director of rugby.\n\n\u201cThis match is just as important as the three that we have already played \u2013 it has the same number of log points available and the same impact on our chances of qualifying and we have to now complete the job.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of new combinations in our team but we have been together for several weeks now and everyone understands our gameplan and strategies. The nice thing is that at the end of the match every member of the squad will have started a Rugby World Cup match.\n\n\u201cBut the first thing we have to focus on is winning the match and securing a place in the quarter-finals.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of positional changes in the backline with Sbu Nkosi switching to the left wing, Warrick Gelant starting on the right flank and De Allende being given a start at outside centre.\n\nThe versatile Thomas du Toit starts at loosehead prop while Francois Louw is at No 8 with Schalk Brits returning to his more usual No 2 jersey after appearing at the back of the scrum against Namibia.\n\nA powerful looking bench includes five of the starting XV from the victory over Italy in Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Handre Pollard and Willie le Roux.\n\nRested completely from the Italy squad are prop Tendai Mtawarira, hooker Bongi Mbonambi, centre Lukhanyo Am and wings Cheslin Kolbe and Makazole Mapimpi \u2013 who had featured in all four matches in Japan \u2013 as well as Lood de Jager, Duane Vermeulen and Faf de Klerk.\n\n\u201cOur preparations for the match have been shortened by the turnaround time but we are giving Canada the same attention we applied in the three previous matches,\u201d said Erasmus.\n\nThe match kicks off at 12h15 (SA time) and is available on SuperSport channel 201 or SABC radio.\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Damian Willemse, 14 Warrick Gelant, 13 Damian de Allende, 12 Frans Steyn, 11 Sbu Nkosi, 10 Elton Jantjies, 9 Cobus Reinach, 8 Francois Louw, 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Siya Kolisi, 5 Franco Mostert, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Vincent Koch, 2 Schalk Brits, 1 Thomas du Toit\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Eben Etzebeth, 20 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 21 Herschel Jantjies, 22 Handre Pollard, 23 Willie le Roux\n\nCanada\n\nTBA", "description": "The Springboks have made 13 changes to their starting XV for Tuesday\u2019s match against Canada in Kobe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7885/f212aa685bae4916bd1747eb63bc1bc0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
