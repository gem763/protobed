We can\u2019t tell between them (Picture: Rex \u2013 Kylie Jenner)\n\nIt\u2019s official, little Stormi Webster has already won Halloween as she dressed as her mum Kylie Jenner\u2019s mini-me and frankly, it\u2019s iconic.\n\nThe one-year-old tot took inspiration from Kylie\u2019s lavender ostrich-feathered Versace gown which she wore to the Met Gala in May.\n\nMaking for the most adorable little costume, Stormi is seen wearing a pretty near identical dress complete with sparkling handbag and, of course, a lavender-coloured wig similar to the one Kylie rocked at the prestigious ball.\n\nIt seems Stormi really does take after her mother as the toddler stood there, pouted, posed and flashed the sweetest smile as though she were on her own red carpet.\n\n\u2018My baby!!!!!!!! i cant handle this!!!! [sic],\u2019 Kylie captioned the Instagram post with several purple heart emojis.\n\nStormi\u2019s look got perhaps the most important seal of approval as her father, Travis Scott, simply left a heart emoji under the pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModel Chanel Iman had all the feels too and commented: \u2018Ohhh I love it She\u2019s adorable,\u2019 while Cassie Ventura shared a similar response: \u2018OMG I can\u2019t.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nKris Jenner\u2019s boyfriend Corey Gamble basically hailed little Stormi a queen and said: \u2018She The real Boss!\u2019 while Sofia Richie exclaimed: \u2018Omg I can\u2019t deal.\u2019\n\nStormi\u2019s epic Halloween costume also got the thumbs up from the likes of Paris Hilton and Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nWell done Stormi, you\u2019re the MVP of Halloween 2019.\n\nIconic (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nKylie and Stassi recreating that famous moment (Picture: Kylie Jenner, Instagram)\n\nKylie, 22, has been killing it this spooky season after revealing her first costume over the weekend.\n\nFollowing a wild night out with Scott Disick\u2019s girlfriend Sofia, which included downing tequila from the bottle, the cosmetics mogul transformed herself into Madonna while her bestie Anastasia \u2018Stassi\u2019 Karanikolaou became Britney Spears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair then recreated the iconic moment the popstars kissed on-stage at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2003.\n\nAnd Kylie teased that was only her first outfit so the best is probably yet to come once 31 October rears its creepy head.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
