REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nIn a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, Trump said there was \u201cbroad bipartisan agreement, for decades if not centuries, that a sitting president cannot be subjected to criminal process.\u201d\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, in August subpoenaed Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns from 2011 to 2018 and other records from the president\u2019s longtime accounting firm Mazars USA.\n\nIn a separate filing on Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice argued that the court must block Vance from getting the tax returns until they have made a \u201cheightened and particularized showing of need for the documents\u2019 production.\u201d\n\nThough the Justice Department stopped short of saying Vance could not get the returns under any circumstances, it said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he could demonstrate an immediate need for them because the U.S. Constitution bars states from prosecuting a sitting president.\n\n\u201cRecognition of these principles does not place the president above the law; it merely postpones initiation of any potential criminal prosecution until his term of office ends,\u201d the department said.\n\nA spokesman for Vance\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nVance\u2019s subpoena was part of a criminal probe into the Republican president and his family business. The scope of that probe is not publicly known.\n\nTrump sued Vance\u2019s office in Manhattan federal court to block the subpoena. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero threw out Trump\u2019s lawsuit on Monday, calling his claim that he was immune from investigation \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd Circuit has put Marrero\u2019s order on hold, and is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 23.\n\nVance\u2019s investigation comes amid an impeachment inquiry and investigations into Trump\u2019s finances by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSeparately on Friday, a federal appeals court in Washington backed an effort by a House Oversight Committee to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records from Mazars.\n\nTwo other House committees are seeking to obtain Trump\u2019s financial records from Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N). The 2nd Circuit is currently considering a lawsuit by Trump to block them from getting those records, which do not include his tax returns.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on the president\u2019s request in a July phone call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic former vice president Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday urged a federal appeals court to block New York prosecutors from obtaining eight years of his tax returns, arguing that he was immune from criminal investigation as a sitting president.", "authors": ["Brendan Pierson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439840070&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A244", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
