Photo: Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images\n\nSupernatural, the show Jared Padalecki co-anchored for 15 seasons, is finally coming to an end, but the man is not taking a vacation! Deadline reported today that Padalecki will take the titular role in a reboot of Walker, Texas Ranger, which starred Chuck Norris in its original incarnation and ran for eight seasons. The idea of a series coming into existence right now and running for a decade is hard to fathom, but that\u2019s what a program like Walker and an actor like Padalecki are built for: longevity. He\u2019s got a ways to go before he laps the television endurance of David Boreanaz \u2014 who has starred in two shows that surpassed 100 episodes, and also there was that time he spent on Buffy \u2014 but Supernatural beat out even the Bones run by three seasons.\n\nThis new Walker doesn\u2019t have a network yet, but the show\u2019s original home, CBS, is said to be in the running for it, along with the CW, which has housed Padalecki\u2019s Supernatural for the past generation. In a very CBS way, the reboot will \u201cexplore morality, family, and rediscovering our lost common ground,\u201d and the noble Cordell Walker will be a \u201cbroken widower and father of two\u201d with his \u201cown moral code to fight for what\u2019s right, regardless of the rules.\u201d According to Deadline, he will also have a female partner. Together they are \u201cthe modern-day heroes our world needs.\u201d But the most important question is: What role will Jensen Ackles play? Because the Winchesters will definitely be together in a new form, right?", "description": "Following the conclusion of Supernatural, Jared Padalecki will now fight the good fight in a reboot of Walker, Texas Ranger.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/23/23-jared-padalecki.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
