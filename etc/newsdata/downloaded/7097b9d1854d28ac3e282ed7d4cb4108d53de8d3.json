He was obviously facing a different level of competition, but he still looked like a complete mismatch in talent compared to the rest of the league.\n\nNow, Johnson figures to fill in the back end of the Pistons roster. He averaged only 6.8 points and 3.1 rebounds per game while shooting a rough 40.6 percent from the field during his last NBA campaign, split between the Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Iso Joe is back in the NBA after an MVP season in the Big 3.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YvZecVFerFGDZTqOdMe7ew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/n6gS5Ev6zd6Fn2m8HX5wVQ--~B/aD0yODgxO3c9NDMyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/fbc89020-d5ab-11e9-8bbf-320ac626d974", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
