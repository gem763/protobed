It\u2019s also precisely as gross as you\u2019d imagine, but biologists are fascinated by The Blob and other slime moulds like it.\n\n\u201cThe blob is a living being which belongs to one of nature\u2019s mysteries,\u201d said Bruno David, who directs the Paris Museum of Natural History.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, David said The Blob \u201csurprises us because it has no brain but is able to learn.\u201d\n\nCiting studies into slime moulds and their ilk, Quanta Magazine last year said researchers had successfully \u2018trained\u2019 organisms like The Blob, despite the fact they don\u2019t even have goddamned brains:\n\nMost importantly, slime molds can be taught new tricks; depending on the species, they may not like caffeine, salt or strong light, but they can learn that no-go areas marked with these are not as bad as they seem, a process known as habituation.\n\nAs someone who gravitates towards coffee, snacks, and the brain-melting light of my smartphone, I have to agree with the smile moulds on that one.\n\nBiologists are also fascinated by the possibility that slime moulds which merge can effectively \u2018share\u2019 those memories between cells, which, if proven, could rewrite much of what we know about evolutionary biology.\n\nBecause I am suddenly and irreversibly obsessed with The Blob and other slime moulds, here are some other facts: David said The Blob can digest food without having a stomach, can heal itself in two minutes after being chopped apart, and exhibits nearly 720 sexes.\n\nI now love The Blob. It is my disgusting child. Look at it.
