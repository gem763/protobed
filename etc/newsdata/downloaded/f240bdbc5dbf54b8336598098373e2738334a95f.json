Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nWRAPPING YOUR MIND AROUND TODAY \u2026 JOSEPH MAGUIRE, the acting DNI who is denying a Washington Post story saying he threatened to quit, will testify in front of the HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE at 9 a.m. in 2154 Rayburn.\n\nTHE TITLE OF THE HEARING: Whistleblower Disclosure. Nearly the entire committee will have read the whistleblower report by the hearing, and will be well versed in its contents.\n\nWE SPOKE WITH DEMOCRATS FAMILIAR with the game plan, and here\u2019s the deal:\n\nTHIS IS NOT AN IMPEACHMENT HEARING, but rather an oversight hearing of the intelligence community. But obviously, the material here is highly relevant to impeachment. The Democrats\u2019 goal is to understand what the White House and DOJ did to block Congress from getting the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and IG report, and why. Was there a cover-up? Who ordered what, when, why and through what channels? The committee will also be pushing for the DNI to make more information about the complaint public -- although there\u2019s skepticism they\u2019ll be able to do that.\n\nNEW: THE ADVISERS \u2026 WHO HAS THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMITTEE\u2019S EAR? The Democratic leadership and committee staff are relying on significant outside counsel as they try to keep the impeachment and oversight process on the tracks.\n\nPHIL SCHILIRO, who ran leg affairs for President BARACK OBAMA and was a top Oversight staffer for Rep. HENRY WAXMAN (D-Calif.), is informally advising the Democratic leadership and key committees about the oversight process. He recently started Co-Equal, an organization dedicated to legislating. (The organization has compiled Oversight Committee precedent. So if someone says \u201cNo staff member has ever been able to question a witness!\u201d Co-Equal can tell you when it\u2019s happened.) Also advising the Democrats: FRED WERTHEIMER and LAURENCE TRIBE.\n\n-- ABOUT THE COUNTS: Every news organization with a major Washington presence -- including POLITICO -- has kept helpful counts of who is supporting impeachment. The counts have differed, because some people count those who supported an impeachment inquiry, others count people who supported impeachment itself. Several outlets alerted the number 218 last night.\n\nTHESE COUNTS don\u2019t matter much in the Democratic leadership -- very few people are paying attention to them at this point. LET US EXPLAIN: The House is already in the middle of an impeachment inquiry, so asking whether someone supports that is not exactly the most relevant question. Asking someone if they would vote for impeachment is also not really operative, since we don\u2019t know what the impeachment articles will look like yet. A vote for what?\n\nWhat you need to know is that the counts are going up. And, frankly, they might be most helpful in determining who is still skittish about impeachment. So don\u2019t worry about the overall number just yet.\n\nBIDEN SPEAKS, via a pool report from NBC\u2019s Marianna Sotomayor in Bel Air, Calif.: \u201cBiden stressed once again that there is no proof to the president\u2019s allegations that he and his son Hunter Biden had conflicts of interest while he served as vice president.\n\n\u201c\u2018This is not about me and it really isn\u2019t because not a single publication said anything he has ever said about me or my son is true. Everyone has gone and researched it and said it\u2019s not true,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cBiden suggested that Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate him and his son because \u201870-something polls show that I\u2019ll kick his \u2026 toes.\u2019\u201d\n\nGood Thursday morning.

Hoyer was sitting in a rental car in South Carolina, after attending the funeral of Emily Clyburn, the late wife of House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, earlier in the day. \u2026\n\n\u201cWhile on a plane back to Washington that night, Pelosi scrolled through a Washington Post op-ed that had published minutes earlier from seven vulnerable Democratic freshmen \u2014 and long-time impeachment holdouts \u2014 backing proceedings to remove Trump from office. \u2026 In fact, Pelosi had spoken to the group on a conference call on Monday night, offering guidance before their op-ed went live.\n\n\u201cShe then started jotting down notes, the first draft of her own speech endorsing an inquiry \u2014 words that would not only formalize the House investigation but potentially change the course of the nation and define her storied career. But there was a hiccup: \u2018I put down some notes on the plane at 10 p.m. at night but then I left it on the plane,\u2019 Pelosi said. \u2026\n\n\u201cIt was May 22 \u2026 That was when Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois moderate who chairs the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, made a pronouncement that stunned the room. \u2018We just need to let all this Mueller stuff go,\u2019 Bustos said, according to three sources who attended the meeting.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- WAPO TICK TOCK \u2026 \u201cSeven days: Inside Trump\u2019s frenetic response to the whistleblower complaint and the battle over impeachment,\u201d by Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Phil Rucker: \u201cThe helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct.\n\n\u201cEven some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval that an impeachment fight could wreak on Trump and his administration, especially as he heads into the 2020 election.\u201d WaPo\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The Senate majority leader has kept a sphynx-like pose during all manner of President Donald Trump controversies. But with an impeachment cloud settling over Washington, McConnell is revealing even less than usual.\n\n\u201cThe GOP leader is saying very little to his members about either his mood or his own view of a political threat that could imperil not just Trump but his Senate majority, according to interviews with nearly a dozen senators. But on Wednesday evening McConnell dismissed criticism of the readout of Trump's call with the Ukrainian president and said it is \"laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\"\n\n\"I've read the summary of the call. If this is the \u2018launching point\u2019 for House Democrats' impeachment process, they've already overplayed their hand. It's clear there is no quid pro quo that the Democrats were desperately praying for,\u2019 McConnell said in a statement for this story.\u201d POLITICO\n\nIMPEACHMENT CLIP PACKET \u2026\n\n-- NYT: \u201cWhistle-Blower Is Said to Allege Concerns About White House Handling of Ukraine Call,\u201d by Charlie Savage, Mike Schmidt and Julian Barnes: \u201cThe intelligence officer who filed a whistle-blower complaint about President Trump\u2019s interactions with the leader of Ukraine raised alarms not only about what the two men said in a phone call, but also about how the White House handled records of the conversation, according to two people briefed on the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe whistle-blower, moreover, identified multiple White House officials as witnesses to potential presidential misconduct who could corroborate the complaint, the people said \u2014 adding that the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, interviewed witnesses.\n\n\u201cMr. Atkinson eventually concluded that there was reason to believe that the president might have illegally solicited a foreign campaign contribution \u2014 and that his potential misconduct created a national security risk, according to a newly disclosed Justice Department memo.\u201d NYT\n\n-- THE APRIL PHONE CALL \u2026 NYT: \u201cWhen Ukraine elected its new leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, on April 21, Mr. Trump seized on the moment as an opportunity to press his case. Within hours of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s victory, Mr. Trump placed a congratulatory call as he was en route from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to Washington.\n\n\u201cHe urged Mr. Zelensky to coordinate with Mr. Giuliani and to pursue investigations of \u2018corruption,\u2019 according to people familiar with the call, the details of which have not previously been reported.\u201d NYT\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cJustice Dept. rejected investigation of Trump phone call just weeks after it began examining the matter,\u201d by Matt Zapotosky and Devlin Barrett: \u201cJustice Department officials took less than a month to abandon an inquiry into President Trump\u2019s communications with his Ukrainian counterpart about investigating former vice president Joe Biden \u2014 reigniting concerns among Democrats and legal observers that the law enforcement agency is serving as a shield for the commander in chief.\n\n\u201cJust weeks after intelligence leaders asked the Justice Department and FBI to consider examining a summer phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the head of the department\u2019s criminal division determined there was not sufficient cause even to launch an investigation, senior Justice Department officials said.\n\n\u201cDepartment officials and career public integrity prosecutors reviewed a rough transcript of the call and verified its authenticity, but \u2014 because a case was not opened \u2014 took no other steps, such as conducting interviews, the officials said. They looked only at whether Trump might have violated campaign finance laws, not federal corruption statutes, even though some legal analysts said there seemed to be evidence of both.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- CNN: \u201cWhistleblower tentatively agrees to testify, attorneys say, as long as they get appropriate clearances to attend hearing,\u201d by Zachary Cohen, Pamela Brown, Paul LeBlanc and Manu Raju: \u201cThe anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, which includes allegations about President Donald Trump's conduct, has tentatively agreed to meet with congressional lawmakers, according to correspondence obtained by CNN.\n\n\u201cThe meeting could take place on the condition that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire approves appropriate security clearances for the individual's legal counsel so that they can accompany their client, the correspondence showed. Rep. Chris Stewart, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Twitter late Wednesday night that the complaint had been declassified but the document was not immediately available publicly.\u201d CNN\n\nNEW \u2026 NBC\u2019S JOSH LEDERMAN and KRISTEN WELKER: \u201cAfter President Donald Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, on a possible corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, the Ukrainians turned to another American to facilitate the introduction: Ambassador Kurt Volker, Trump\u2019s part-time envoy for Ukraine.\n\n\u201c\u2018Ambassador Volker called me,\u2019 Giuliani told NBC News in an interview Wednesday night. Although Volker has mostly stayed under the radar since taking the job in 2017, his unusual arrangement as Trump\u2019s special representative for Ukraine negotiations is attracting new attention amid revelations of his role in the ongoing Ukraine saga.\n\n\u201cAn unpaid volunteer, Volker spends most of his time engaged in outside projects, including his work at a Washington lobbying firm that continued to represent the Government of Ukraine for almost two years after Volker started as special envoy.\u201d NBC\n\nOPINIONATORS \u2026\n\n-- THE RIGHT \u2026 WSJ: \u201cThe Ukraine Transcript Fizzle\u201d: \u201cThe White House on Wednesday released the transcript of President Trump\u2019s July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the news is that Mr. Trump was telling the truth about it. The conversation was largely routine diplomacy, and even the reference to Joe Biden was less than promoted by the press. Good luck persuading Americans that this is an impeachable offense. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe references to the Bidens are in the context of fighting corruption, not as a prerequisite of U.S. aid. Mr. Trump was unwise to mention Mr. Biden, but the tenor of the conversation is congenial. It\u2019s amusing to hear the same critics who call Mr. Trump an oafish thug on a daily basis now say this was all a subtle masterpiece of extortion. When is Mr. Trump ever subtle?\n\n\u201cDemocrats are making much of Mr. Trump\u2019s references to Attorney General Barr, which were also imprudent in the Biden context. But the Justice Department says nothing came of it, that Mr. Trump never asked Mr. Barr to make that call, and Mr. Barr has never communicated with Ukraine, or with Mr. Giuliani about Ukraine.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- THE LEFT \u2026 NYT: \u201cNancy Pelosi Is Sending a Message: Lots of them, in fact\u201d: \u201cThe message for Mr. Trump is the most straightforward: Enough. After months of watching the president ravage democratic norms and taunt lawmakers about their inability to hold him accountable, Congress is making clear that there are lines that cannot be crossed without repercussion.\u201d NYT\n\nTRUMP\u2019S THURSDAY -- The president will leave Trump Tower at 9:05 a.m. en route to the InterContinental New York Barclay, where he\u2019ll participate in a meet-and-greet with the U.S. Mission to the U.N.

At the time, James Biden\u2019s business partners were pursuing a potential investment in Integrate, according to Frey and court records. Frey, who had a business relationship with James Biden and his associates, had introduced the group to Integrate.\n\n\u201cJames Biden told the Integrate executives that he would get the Biden Cancer Initiative to promote an oral rinse made by the firm and used by cancer patients, Frey, who said he participated in the call, told POLITICO. He added that James Biden directly invoked the former vice president on the call. \u2018He said his brother would be very excited about this product,\u2019 Frey said. A spokesman for James Biden disputed Frey\u2019s account.\u201d POLITICO\n\nSCOOP -- \u201cTrump Turnberry resort singled out in airport\u2019s pitch to U.S. military,\u201d by The Scotsman\u2019s Martyn McLaughlin: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort is the only hotel named by Glasgow Prestwick Airport in promotional material distributed at private meetings with US military aircrews in an attempt to win their custom, The Scotsman can reveal.\n\n\u201cThe document, prepared by the Scottish Government owned airport and handed out at \u2018closed\u2019 meetings with US Armed Forces personnel, emphasises the \u2018five star\u2019 status of the US president\u2019s flagship Scottish property, even noting how it has been \u2018newly refurbished.\u2019\n\n\u201cTwo sources familiar with the gatherings said Prestwick staff also delivered presentations in which they offered to arrange rounds of golf at Turnberry for visiting US Air Force (USAF) crews as part of their layovers.\u201d The Scotsman\n\nBIBI\u2019S BACK, MAYBE \u2026 AP/JERUSALEM: \u201cIsrael\u2019s Netanyahu begins coalition hunt amid deadlock\u201d: \u201cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began Thursday the daunting task of trying to cobble together a coalition government amid political deadlock that emerged from this month\u2019s repeat elections, which had no clear winner.\n\n\u201cHe now has up to six weeks to attempt to resolve the political impasse, but his odds appear slim. Even with the support of smaller allies, both Netanyahu and his main challenger, Blue and White party leader and former army chief Benny Gantz, lack the support for the required 61-seat parliamentary majority needed to establish a government. That\u2019s including the support of Netanyahu\u2019s traditional ultra-Orthodox and religious-nationalist allies.\u201d AP\n\n-- NOTE: Trump has been uncharacteristically silent about all this, aside from a rather cold Sept. 18 comment that the U.S. relationship is with the state of Israel, rather than any one leader.\n\nWHAT THE PENTAGON IS READING -- @SenatorDurbin: \u201cI\u2019m calling on the DoD OIG to investigate the withholding of Ukraine military aid appropriated by Congress, allegedly at the direction of the White House.
