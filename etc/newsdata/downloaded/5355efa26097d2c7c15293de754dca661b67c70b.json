It was very satisfying because it makes sense with lots of other research that has been done by colleagues. It provides this molecular explanation now as to how this jump could have occurred.\n\n\"Rh5 currently is an important blood stage vaccine candidate for malaria and so if we can get any more information on this gene, that could really help us in trying to combat this disease.\"\n\nHe said the chances of the parasite mutating again soon were \"very, very slim\", although theoretically possible.\n\nNearly half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The most cases and deaths occur in young children in sub-Saharan Africa, caused by Plasmodium falciparum.", "description": "Discovery of mutation 50,000 years ago could help in the fight against malaria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11097/production/_109238796_gettyimages-450997371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
