There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Saudi Arabia.'\n\nAmal was convicted of administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life and a further charge of child cruelty by 'wilfully ill treating the child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering'.\n\nMohammed was cleared of the child cruelty charge.\n\nJudge Lucraft adjourned sentence until 4 November but the reality is the pair are unlikely to set foot in the UK again.\n\nThe youngster had been flown to London from overseas in a private air ambulance to be treated for ongoing feeding problems, the court heard.\n\nDoctors managed to provide food through a drip until the child reached a stable condition and was flown home on 6 September 2017.\n\nBut the child was returned to the Savannah ward at the Evelina Hospital on 13 February 2018.\n\nOver the next four weeks the youngster was repeatedly injected with insulin.\n\nAlarmed by the child's plummeting blood sugar levels, doctors discovered the cause to be insulin injection despite the child not being diabetic or having any need for the drug.\n\n\"The effect of the insulin was to reduce her blood sugar levels to dangerously low levels,\" said Sarah Whitehouse QC, prosecuting.\n\n\"If a person stops eating for any length of time their blood sugar levels become very low.\"\n\nMs Whitehouse said the couple 'had access to insulin, they knew how and when to use it, and they knew what its effects were.'\n\nMrs Asiri pestered staff to check the child's blood sugar levels after poisoning them which led doctors to discover the child was hypoglycaemic.\n\n(Image: central news)\n\n\"Asiri seemed to know the child's blood sugar levels had dropped and one explanation for this is that she was causing it to happen by injecting,\" Ms Whitehouse added.\n\nAsiri drew the curtains of the child's private cubicle after attempting to tamper secretively with their medication, the court heard.\n\nDr Helen Mundy became suspicious of the 'erratic' fluctuations in blood sugar and sent samples to be tested in a hospital laboratory after a series of hypoglycemic attacks between 14 February 2018 to 21 February 2018.\n\nThe youngster's blood sugar levels were maintained with glucose through a drip until Dr Mundy spotted their tube had been detached on 4 March, jurors heard.\n\nMedical staff then braced themselves for another crash in blood sugar levels but were shocked when further tests revealed the levels remained the same.\n\nMs Whitehouse said: 'Dr Mundy was becoming concerned that the cause of these erratic blood sugar levels was an excess of insulin.\n\n\"Dr Mundy could not be sure however whether this excess was being caused by abnormal insulin levels produced by the child themselves or whether it was being administered from outside by someone injecting them.\n\n\"The tube became disconnected and nobody could say for how long it had been disconnected for.\n\n\"What's significant about it is despite the fact that the child was out of glucose their blood sugar levels had not plummeted.\n\n\"On every previous occasion when staff reduced the child's intravenous glucose by even a small amount, the blood sugar levels dropped sharply.\n\n\"Yet on this occasion that did not happen.\n\n\"Mrs Asiri arrived back a few minutes later and immediately tried to draw the curtains to the child's cubicle.\n\n\n\n\"She was asked not to do so.\"\n\nPolice searched the hospital bed followed by the couple's apartment after they were arrested on 9 March 2018.\n\nOfficers uncovered a black handbag stuffed with insulin needles with the child's DNA on the tip of one.\n\nFour boxes of insulin pens were then found hidden in the fridge at their flat.\n\nThe pair denied any wrongdoing in police interviews and Mrs Asiri claimed she had simply forgotten to empty her bag of the needles.\n\nMr Asiri admitted he understood how insulin impacted blood sugar but claimed a nurse was responsible for the dangerous injections.\n\n\"He said that he understood how dangerous it was when blood sugars dropped but he had not interfered with the child's condition,\" said Ms Whitehouse.\n\nMrs Asiri, formerly of Kensington, denied but was convicted of one charge of cruelty to a person under the age of 16 while her husband was cleared of the charge.\n\nAmal Asiri alone also denied but was convicted of administering a poison or noxious substance to a child, so as to endanger life.", "description": "Amal Asiri, 29, and her husband Mohammed Asiri, 38, were last seen on 27 September and failed to turn up for trial at the Old Bailey three days later", "authors": ["Nina Lloyd", "Image", "Central News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707123.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-cnl_A_Asiri_Mohammed_Asiri_1a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
