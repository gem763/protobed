The issue has previously been identified by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nWhile Mr Elliott considered it unlikely that Australia would enter an official recession, he told the Arnold Bloch Leibler event that \u201cmany households feel they have less discretionary income\u201d and economic growth is \u201cbelow its potential\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, the Reserve Bank\u2019s official rate cut earlier this month had a limited short-term impact because \u201cunfortunately, the relief from low interest rates is starting to be poured back into housing. [Consumers] are not spending it on retail or other things\u201d.\n\nLending grey line\n\nAfter ANZ mortgage volumes were crippled by an over-conservative approach to responsible lending, Mr Elliott said this was starting to correct itself.\n\nAfter meeting with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and Australian Securities and Investments Commission this week, he said ANZ was cautiously moving back towards the \u201cgrey line\u201d of what is a responsible loan, after \u201cstaying away from the line because it is too hard\u201d during the uncertainty of the banking royal commission.\n\n\u201cWe are still not really sure where the line is \u2026 but we are slowly crawling back to where we see the line. It will work itself out when it is clarified by the courts and ASIC \u2013 that will slowly build up confidence,\" he said. \"But it\u2019s been dislocating for customers.\"\n\nOpen banking risks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government\u2019s open banking regime could provide banks with their next headache, Mr Elliott suggested, given it will allow big data to be used to price loans based on individual borrowers\u2019 risks. This could lead to more discriminatory pricing, which raised questions about equity and access to finance.\n\n\u201cYou are going to see the emergence of targeted, nuanced banking \u2013 and the big question for the community is that in the old system, everyone paid about the same. But in a world of risk-based pricing, who will get the best deals? People with money. So there will be social implications of that.\u201d\n\nThe banking industry is facing \u201cmassive change\u201d from empowered regulators, more scrutiny, and new technology facilitating switching, Mr Elliott said. Even though banks remain profitable and serve customers well, \u201cinternally, it feels like we are in a crisis,\u201d he told the lunch.\n\nRepeating a theme in a speech to the Intersekt fintech festival last week, Mr Elliott said it was hard to know which technology giants would be competitors in the future. \u201cWe need to change our business to respond to that otherwise we will be in serious trouble,\u201d he said.\n\nANZ will release its full-year results on October 31.", "description": "ANZ boss Shayne Elliott said many customers felt like the economy was in recession as savings from the latest round of rate cuts were used to reduce housing debt.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1935%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_451%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f060858889f650a6f9b359b7a4f4c2c713f6529c", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
