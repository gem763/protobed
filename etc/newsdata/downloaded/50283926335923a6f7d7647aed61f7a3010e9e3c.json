Today, six of the top ten companies are coming out of China and certainly do not share our values on things like expression.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook CEO also warned that Chinese tech companies have an advantage in terms of infrastructure, and the close partnerships between Chinese tech companies and the Communist government.\n\n\u201cPart of the infrastructure that they\u2019re building on is a lot more modern than some of what we would have to build on here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as we put forward the white paper around the Libra project, China immediately announced a public-private partnership working with companies like that, to extend the work that they\u2019d already done with Alipay into a digital Renmimbi as part of the Belt & Road initiative that they have, and they\u2019re planning on launching that in the next few months.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
