Donald Trump\u2019s declarations and proclamations, however, tend to be more problematic than most.\n\nWhen the Republican recognized Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, for example, we were reminded of the many women who\u2019ve accused Trump of sexual misconduct. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we were reminded of the president\u2019s snide mockery of former prisoners of war. On World Autism Day, we\u2019re reminded of the ridiculous things Trump has said about autism and vaccines.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this week, which is apparently \u201cNational Character Counts Week.\u201d Trump\u2019s latest proclamation emphasizes the importance of inspiring future leaders to \u201clead lives of virtue and integrity,\u201d and providing them with a strong \u201cmoral compass.\u201d\n\n\u201c[C]haracter is developed consciously through exemplary effort and respect for others. \u201cThroughout this week, and each day of our lives, may we strive to demonstrate good character through our thoughts, discourse, and deeds in our homes, schools, workplaces, and houses of worship. Let us set an example for others of the timeless values of respect, compassion, justice, tolerance, fairness, and integrity. May we never forget that our Nation is only as strong as the virtue and character of our citizenry.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Michael Gerson had a column a couple of years ago, wondering whether Trump is \u201cmorally equipped to be president.\u201d The piece highlighted Trump\u2019s \u201cvulgarity and smallness, which have been the equivalent of spray-painting graffiti on the Washington Monument.\u201d\n\nThat was written in 2017. Trump\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d has not improved as his presidency has progressed.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily expect Trump to ignore \u201cNational Character Counts Week,\u201d but he probably shouldn\u2019t be too surprised when those who see his proclamation take note of the gap between the message and the messenger.", "description": "On \"National Character Counts Week,\" Trump shouldn't be surprised when those who see his proclamation take note of the gap between the message and the messenger", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/180308-msnbc-donald-trump-proclamation-se-442p.jpg?itok=ibTFcqh8", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
