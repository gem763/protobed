The first lady, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is carved into a piece of granite placed beside a new 160-seat lecture theater co-funded by Hands and his wife, Julia.\n\nRoosevelt was a champion of civil rights, diversity, and female empowerment; the 59-year-old Hands, who made his fortune investing as the founder of private-equity firm Terra Firma, is also a supporter of equality.\n\nOn this bright but bitter British morning, Oxford\u2019s Mansfield College is home to both the queen of diversity and the onetime king of private equity. Both had humble beginnings.\n\nWhen he was 3 years old, Hands moved with his parents from South Africa to the United Kingdom. He overcame severe dyslexia and bullying at his non-fee-paying school, known in the U.K. as a state school, to amass a 265 million pound sterling (US$320 million) fortune. He is driven by helping others wishing to follow a similar path.\n\nTerra Firma has grown by investing almost \u00a315 billion in 33 businesses, including Odeon cinemas and bookmaker William Hill. But it will probably be most remembered for a deal that went horribly wrong: The firm lost its entire \u00a31.75 billion investment in EMI when the music publisher ran into financial trouble and lender Citigroup took it over in 2011. Hands embarked on a lengthy legal battle against Citi, which he eventually dropped some years later. He has since been struggling to regain his crown.\n\n\u201c Diversity in the student population means a diverse business world, which is healthy and more productive. \u201d \u2014Guy Hands\n\nSo when it comes to legacy, is philanthropy a substitute for something his business might not deliver? \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d says Hands, perched on a sofa inside the sumptuous lodgings of\n\nMansfield\u2019s principal. \u201cFailure has never worried me. It\u2019s actually made me more motivated to do business.\u201d\n\nHands is also seeking to support causes that are close to his heart. Hands says he always had a connection with minorities. This came from having fled South Africa at the height of apartheid and feeling like an outsider himself on arriving in the U.K., being dyslexic and bullied at school. \u201cMy parents were incredibly politically aligned against apartheid,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very socially conscious and personally could identify in some way with minorities.\u201d\n\nDespite Hands\u2019 limited academic credentials, Mansfield College saw potential and he was accepted into Oxford. Now he wants to help others achieve their potential. \u201cMansfield was in financial trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cI asked them why I should give them my money. They then redefined their core values with a goal of becoming a more liberal, socially inclusive, diverse college.\u201d The college set itself a target of lifting admissions of students from state schools to 75% and improving diversity. Hands gave it an endowment of an undisclosed amount, and has supported Mansfield via The Hands Family Trust for almost 20 years. Mansfield now leads the way at Oxford with 96% of its U.K. offers to students from the state sector.\n\nIts drive for diversity has gone further, with 33.3% of the 2018 student intake identifying themselves as a member of a minority group. \u201cDiversity in the student population means a diverse business world, which is healthy and more productive,\u201d Hands says.\n\nAround 20% of all undergraduates at Mansfield are on full scholarships, while one in five students this year come from a family with a combined income of less than \u00a316,000. The Hands Building, which opened last year, bears his name in recognition of his work with his alma mater. It also contains the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights.\n\nTerra Firma London donates 10% of its pretax profits annually, in aggregate, to the Terra Firma Charitable Trust and Impetus PEF. As for his legacy, Hands believes it will come from future business achievements rather than a lecture theater. \u201cRay Kroc founded McDonald\u2019s when he was my age,\u201d Hands says. \u201cHis legacy was based on the last 15 years of his life.\u201d\n\nThe king of private equity could rise once again.", "description": "Even as the Terra Firma founder pursues causes close to his heart, his professional drive remains", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Guy Hands"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-101365/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
