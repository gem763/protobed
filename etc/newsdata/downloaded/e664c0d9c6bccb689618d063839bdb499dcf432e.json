REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nFramed as a \u201creset\u201d in the relationship, Washington\u2019s envoy to Brussels told reporters that Pompeo\u2019s meetings with the new four top officials on Monday night and on Tuesday went \u201cextraordinarily well\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe secretary made this trip solely and exclusively to see the four EU leaders with the objective of resetting our relationship,\u201d U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland said.\n\n\u201cOur relationship had reached multiple impasses on multiple fronts and resulted in a lot of uncomfortable, cranky conversations,\u201d he said, saying Trump endorsed Pompeo\u2019s trip.\n\nFrom his support for Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc to a brief downgrade of the EU\u2019s status in Washington, Trump\u2019s disdain for Brussels and his withdrawal from agreements backed by the EU have soured ties and divided traditional allies.\n\nThe meetings signal a change in approach. In late 2018, Pompeo warned in a speech in Brussels that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy was reshaping the post-World War Two system on the basis of sovereign states, not institutions like the EU.\n\nBut Sondland said the new team chosen to run the bloc\u2019s three institutions of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council had grown used to Trump\u2019s leadership style and were ready to work with him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that we share the same objective but we have different tactics,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nThe EU institutions declined to comment.\n\nPompeo met Germany\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, who will take over as president of the Commission; the EU\u2019s incoming foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell of Spain; Belgium\u2019s caretaker prime minister Charles Michel, who will chair EU summits; and Italy\u2019s David Sassoli, the new speaker of the EU\u2019s parliament.\n\nVon der Leyen and Borrell take office on Nov. 1, while Michel will start in December. Sassoli began in July.\n\n\u201cIt is a healthy thing to disagree .. But that doesn\u2019t belie the friendship and the necessity of a long-time alliance. This is not a Trump issue ... this is a EU-U.S. issue,\u201d Sondland said after Pompeo had left for Washington.\n\nSondland said he also hoped all four new leaders would meet Trump in the White House soon.\n\n\u201cThey are welcome to call Pompeo 24/7 ... even just to talk. All four of them can get through to the president if they really would like to speak to him directly,\u201d Sondland said.\n\nFor his part, Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to accuse Brussels of unfair trade practices.\n\n\u201cFor all of the \u2018geniuses\u2019 out there, many who have been in other administrations and \u2018taken to the cleaners\u2019 by China, that want me to get together with the EU and others to go after China Trade practices remember, the EU & all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also.
