After more than 15 years of conflict and a dire need to rebuild, Iraq's government hails this growth as a success.\n\nIraq's crude oil exports also increased to 3.6 million bpd in August, from 3.56 million bpd the previous month, according to its oil ministry.", "description": "Iraq, OPEC's second-largest oil producer, needs the increased revenues after years of war.
