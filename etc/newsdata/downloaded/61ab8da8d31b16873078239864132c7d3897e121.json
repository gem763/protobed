He gloated and goaded on Twitter. He stood outside the White House and crowed. Mueller had done \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cvery poorly,\u201d the president said on the South Lawn. He called it \u201ca great day for me.\u201d He was, after all, rid, it seemed, of perhaps his first term\u2019s preeminent enemy.\n\nIt took him less than 24 hours to flip to the next big fight.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBecause on July 25, according to reports, Trump pressured repeatedly the leader of Ukraine to help rustle up potential political ammunition on Joe Biden, the man polls at this point suggest is his most likely opponent in next year\u2019s election.\n\nThat Trump would so quickly in the wake of the Mueller investigation commit a brazen act some critics say represents an egregious and impeachable abuse of power has mystified many observers. How could he have so blithely ignored the lessons of the nearly three-year investigation? But those who know him best say this is merely the latest episode in a lifelong pattern of behavior for the congenitally combative Trump. He\u2019s always been this way. He doesn\u2019t stop to reflect. If he wins, he barely basks. If he loses, he doesn\u2019t take the time to lie low or lick wounds; he invariably refuses to even admit that he lost. Regardless of the outcome\u2014up, down or somewhere in between\u2014when one tussle is done, Trump reflexively starts to scan the horizon in search of a new skirmish.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not in a fight, he looks for one,\u201d former Trump publicist Alan Marcus told me this weekend. \u201cHe can\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always in an attack mode,\u201d former Trump casino executive Jack O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cHe\u2019s always got adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does love a confrontation\u2014there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d added Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive. \u201cTrump thinks he\u2019s always going to win\u2014he really does believe that\u2014and he fights very, very, very dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cA street fighter,\u201d Louise Sunshine, another former Trump Organization executive, once told me.\n\nTrump, of course, has said all of this himself, and for as long as people have been paying him any attention. For decades, he has been redundantly clear. \u201cI go after people,\u201d he has said. \u201c\u2026 as viciously and as violently as you can,\u201d he has said. \u201cIt makes me feel so good,\u201d he has said.\n\nAs president, he\u2019s changed \u2026 not at all.\n\n\u201cI like conflict,\u201d he confirmed last year.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u201cDonald,\u201d wrote Jerome Tuccille, in the first biography ever written of Trump, in 1985, \u201cwas a round, fleshy baby who howled up a storm from the day he was born.\u201d He was \u201ca brat\u201d from the start, according to his oldest sister. In elementary school in Queens, he was a desk-crashing, spitball-spewing, pigtail-pulling playground boor. \u201cSurly,\u201d said one of his teachers. \u201cA little shit,\u201d said another. He was sent at 13 years old some 60 miles up the Hudson River to New York Military Academy, where he was cocksure and hypercompetitive\u2014\u201cso competitive,\u201d his roommate recalled, \u201cthat everybody who could come close to him he had to destroy.\u201d His favorite instructor at NYMA called him \u201ca real pain in the ass.\u201d But it was what Trump\u2019s father had taught him to be. \u201cLife\u2019s a competition,\u201d Fred Trump told his second son and chosen heir. Be a \u201ckiller.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, when Trump was a young adult, Roy Cohn continued the tutorial. \u201cWhat makes Roy Cohn tick?\u201d journalist Ken Auletta once asked Cohn in an interview, the audio recording of which acts as a kind of spine to Matt Tyrnauer\u2019s new documentary. \u201cA love of a good fight,\u201d Cohn answered.\n\n\u201cRoy,\u201d Roger Stone tells Tyrnauer, \u201cwould always be for an offensive strategy. Those are the rules of war. You don\u2019t fight on the other guy\u2019s ground. You define what the debate is going to be about. I think Donald learned that from Roy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bring out the worst in my enemies, and that\u2019s how I get them to defeat themselves,\u201d Cohn once said. Trump was taking notes. \u201cA sponge,\u201d Cohn cousin David Lloyd Marcus told me.\n\n\u201cHe made Donald,\u201d added socialite and celebrity interviewer Nikki Haskell, \u201cvery confrontational.\u201d\n\nTrump spent the 1980s constructing what\u2019s proven to be an ineradicable foundation, opening the refurbished Grand Hyatt, building Trump Tower and buying Mar-a-Lago, the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League and a vast stretch of land on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side that he would try to turn into \u201cTrump City,\u201d pile-driving into the cultural bedrock the places and props that would underpin his persona.\n\nThe consistency of his bellicosity, too, became impossible to ignore. He fought, and he fought, and he fought. Even after fighting the city for lavish tax breaks for his first two projects\u2014and winning\u2014he quickly picked new fights and new foes. He fought preservationists after jackhammering pieces of art on the building he had to tear down to put up the building branded with his name. He fought aghast residents of the neighborhood in which he wanted to plop his most gargantuan project yet.\n\nAnd as the owner of the USFL\u2019s Generals, he fought \u2026 everybody. Arrogant, impulsive and ill-informed, Trump wasted no time starting to fight with his fellow team owners in the second-tier outfit. He then set his sights on the larger, richer, much more powerful National Football League. He wanted to go head-to-head by playing games in the fall instead of the spring. He wanted to fight for players, for television time, for attention. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely at war with the National Football League,\u201d he said just six weeks after he acquired the Generals. He wanted the NFL in the end to take in him and his team, and he didn\u2019t want to wait. And enough of his fellow owners finally capitulated. He sued the NFL\u2014and he lost. \u201cEveryone let Donald Trump take over,\u201d one of the owners said. \u201cIt was our death.\u201d\n\nTrump, though, hadn\u2019t even waited for the verdict to shift his focus. Two months before the upshot in court, he kickstarted his next fight. It started with two words.\n\n\u201cDear Ed \u2026\u201d\n\nMayor Ed Koch. His No. 1 antagonist all decade long.\n\nFor several years, Trump had been looking down from his Trump Tower perches, from his office on the 26th floor and from his triplex at the top, sometimes with a telescope, watching broken Wollman Rink sitting dormant in Central Park. The city had been fumbling in its efforts to fix it, a stupor of faulty Freon, damaged coils and construction delays. And it still was nowhere close to being done. Trump sniffed the possibility of a fight that could make him look good.\n\n\u201cI have watched with amazement,\u201d he wrote in a provocation of a letter to Koch, \u201cas New York City repeatedly failed on its promises to complete and open the Wollman Skating Rink. Building the rink, which essentially involves the pouring of a concrete slab over coolant piping, should take no more than four months\u2019 time. To hear that, after six years, it will now take another two years, is unacceptable to all the thousands of people who are waiting to skate once again at the Wollman Rink. I and all other New Yorkers are tired of watching the catastrophe of Wollman Rink. The incompetence displayed on this simple construction project must be considered one of the great embarrassments of your administration. I fear that in two years there will be no skating at the Wollman Rink, with the general public being the losers.\u201d\n\nHe made his pitch. He wanted to take over the rink and make it work. \u201cI don\u2019t want my name attached to losers,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo far the Wollman Rink has been one of the great losers. I\u2019ll make it a winner.\u201d\n\nAnd he did. The rink opened later in the year to great fanfare in the city and around the country. Beyond the specific accomplishment, though, the entire endeavor let Trump fan his feud with Koch. It was a milepost in their sour, never-ending back-and-forth, Trump calling Koch a \u201cmoron\u201d and a \u201cdisaster,\u201d Koch calling Trump a greedy bully, all of which only intensified later in the decade when Koch spurned Trump\u2019s demands for more tax breaks for his plot on the Upper West Side.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t get the money from the city that he wanted, but the war alone was a sort of a win\u2014a key slice of the Cohn syllabus, passed down. Reporters, as Trump put it, \u201clove stories about extremes, whether they\u2019re great successes or terrible failures.\u201d All publicity was good publicity, he believed, and more than anything else, as he (with Tony Schwartz) would write in The Art of the Deal, \u201cthe press thrives on confrontation.\u201d\n\nThe \u201890s were no different. He fought his first wife through their high-profile split and acrimonious aftermath. He fought his lenders and creditors in a desperate attempt to stay solvent. Most people, perhaps all other people, would have concluded that this was more than enough strife. Not Trump. He picked a fight with casino analyst Marvin Roffman (and lost). He picked a fight with Atlantic City resident Vera Coking (and lost). He engaged in headline-generating legal tit-for-tat with Harry and Leona Helmsley. In 1995, still owing his lenders $115 million of debt he had guaranteed during his late \u201880s shopping spree, Trump teetered on the precipice of personal bankruptcy. Restless and unchastened, he spent the rest of the decade tangling with casino tycoon Steve Wynn in Atlantic City, filing lawsuits, calling him names (\u201can incompetent\u201d) and attempting (and ultimately succeeding) to prevent him from expanding from Las Vegas into what Trump considered his territory.\n\n\u201cHe is a man who will say anything,\u201d Richard D. \u201cSkip\u201d Bronson, Wynn\u2019s righthand man at the time, wrote of Trump in a book about this fight, War at the Shore. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how baseless or how ridiculous the comments, Trump didn\u2019t need to be proven right in order to win. All he had to do was be a nuisance and stall long enough so that the project would no longer be attractive.\u201d Bronson added: \u201cThe whole feud had been a game to him and now that it was over, he was ready to move on.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nOver the last two decades, as his officious schtick on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d somehow forged a path into politics, he sniped with celebrities before he did the same with Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\n\u201cTrump is a predator,\u201d Republican strategist Alex Castellanos asserted last spring. \u201cWhen something enters his world, he either eats it, kills it or mates with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is not interested in pleasures such as art and food and friendship, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be motivated by love or creative impulses. The one exception is his drive to create conflict, which brings him the attention of others. When he says he likes to fight\u2014all kinds of fights\u2014he is telling the truth,\u201d Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio told me earlier this year, pointing to a \u201cdiscomfort\u201d Trump seems to feel in \u201cthe moment of peace that follows a victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d D\u2019Antonio texted this weekend as the Ukraine news was breaking. \u201cIt\u2019s always a matter of a new extreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more comfortable in an adversarial relationship,\u201d O\u2019Donnell, the former Trump casino exec, said when we talked on Sunday. \u201cSo he\u2019s thinking about Mueller one moment, and he\u2019s thinking about Biden the next.\u201d\n\nI asked O\u2019Donnell why he thinks Trump is this way.\n\nHe told me to call a psychiatrist.", "description": "Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal reflects his lifelong craving for a fresh enemy.", "authors": ["Michael Kruse"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/20/39/4a83e809400788a47ace65a9350b/20190922-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
