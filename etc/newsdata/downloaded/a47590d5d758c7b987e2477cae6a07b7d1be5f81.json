That was followed last week by a $400 million deal between Vice Media and Refinery 29.\n\nBetween the lines: Digital media execs and investors have privately told Axios that the combined valuation of Vice Media and Refinery29 should be much lower than the total $4 billion figure that has been reported.\n\nVice investor Disney has already written written down its entire $400 million investment in the company, signaling that it doesn't expect to see any return for its money.\n\nBe smart: Private company valuations are set by figures that investors agree to when they put money into a private company in exchange for a slice of the firm \u2014 the total valuation determines how big the slice is for the cash invested. There's no guarantee an acquirer or the public market will agree with those figures, and valuations are subject to change with market dynamics.\n\nCase-in-point: In 2015, Rakuten was said to be considering acquiring POPSUGAR for $580 million. Four years later, POPSUGAR was reportedly sold at a value just over half of that.\n\nIn 2015, Rakuten was said to be considering acquiring POPSUGAR for $580 million. Four years later, POPSUGAR was reportedly sold at a value just over half of that. Last year, digital news site Mic sold to Bustle Digital Group for a mere $5 million, less than two years after having been valued at more than $100 million.\n\nBottom line: Media companies are merging in an effort to combine resources and reach bigger audiences in a bid to become profitable, or at least get a better shot at competing with the likes of Google and Facebook for ad revenue. But until companies go public or sell for a public cash figure, there's no way of knowing just how much their big bets are really worth.\n\nWorth a read: Via CNBC's Alex Sherman: \"Vice\u2019s $400 million deal for Refinery29 illustrates the pointlessness of private valuations.\"", "description": "What companies are actually worth is a moving target determined by what investors are willing to pay and say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/oHEOLukg6yvRCPQN1zrbGpCuc5g=/0x0:1365x768/1920x1080/2019/10/08/1570502247453.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
