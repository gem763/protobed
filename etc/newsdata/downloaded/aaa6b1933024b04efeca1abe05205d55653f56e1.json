Protests", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration announced Monday that it\u2019s backing down from an attempt to drastically limit protests near the White House and National Mall, bowing to pressure from members of the public who deemed the plan unconstitutional.\n\nThe announcement came from the National Park Service, which oversees the White House grounds and the National Mall, home to the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and several other iconic spots that have served as a backdrop to some of the nation\u2019s most historic demonstrations.\n\nThe proposal, which NPS first revealed in August 2018, sought to create new hurdles for groups planning protests in those areas. The most burdensome would have required organizers to start reimbursing the government for the hefty cost of providing security at such events in order to get a permit. That\u2019s on top of the fees they\u2019re already required to pay for toilets, medical tents and other amenities for participants.\n\nThe proposal also sought to close off 80 percent of the White House sidewalk to protesters, among other restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe intent of the proposed revisions was to maintain the public\u2019s opportunity to hold special events and right to demonstrate while outlining clear parameters that protect the iconic landmarks, views and grounds for use and enjoyment of citizens and visitors from around the globe,\u201d the NPS said in its Monday announcement, defending the idea behind the plan.\n\nThe agency is backing down after receiving more than 140,000 comments about the protest crackdown. That\u2019s a big win for the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped lead the drive for public comments.\n\n\u201cThe National Mall is the place where we, as a nation, go to speak directly to our government,\u201d ACLU senior legislative counsel Kate Ruane said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump might not like having protesters on his doorstep, but the First Amendment guarantees us the right to be there.\u201d\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\u2019s historic 1963 March on Washington, the ACLU noted, would have been too expensive for the organizers to fund had they faced the fees Trump\u2019s administration was proposing today.\n\n\u201cThe National Park Service\u2019s retreat should serve as a reminder that if the administration tries to come after our right to protest,\u201d Ruane continued, \u201cit will have to get through thousands of ACLU members and supporters first.\u201d\n\nIn a rare instance of bipartisan opposition, both left- and right-wing groups have been speaking out against the proposal for the past year. In April, a coalition that included the ACLU and the NAACP alongside the conservative Charles Koch Institute and March for Life organizers wrote a letter to the House Committee on Natural Resources saying they were united against the protest crackdown.\n\n\u201cOur organizations do not agree on all issues,\u201d the letter read, \u201cbut one principle we unreservedly support is our right to gather together to express ourselves.\u201d", "description": "The National Park Service backed down from its plan to severely limit protests near the White House and National Mall after a wave of bipartisan outrage.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db741e9200000de2f507089.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
