I think only Chaplin managed to pull it off, then Hitler went and ruined it for everyone.\n\n\u2018Then his hair cut is stupid. You look in the mirror and you\u2019ve got the stupid getup on and you feel\u2026the best word is worthless.\u2019\n\nHe mock cried: \u2018So it was really hard for me!\u2019\n\nSpeaking of satirising Hitler but not making him accessible, because, you know atrocities, Waititi added he was careful in his approach of how he mastered the outfit.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I had to be very careful not to make the character loveable, or fun, or not to go \u201coooh I can\u2019t wait to dress up in this stuff\u201d. It\u2019s not fun,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I had fun working with Roman and doing those scenes where I\u2019m communicating with him and being an idiot, but there\u2019s never a moment where I feel you should relish playing that role.\u2019\n\nThe film also stars Scarlett as Jojo\u2019s mum (Picture: Twentieth Century Fox)\n\nRecently speaking at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Waititi \u2013 who is set to start working on the fourth Thor film, Love And Thunder \u2013 said: \u2018I play an imaginary friend who is sort of a kind of cross between Hitler and all this little boy\u2019s heroes.\n\n\u2018So it\u2019s all kind of combined into this weird version of\u2026 it\u2019s not Hitler, I\u2019m not trying to play that character, so I didn\u2019t do much research since I\u2019m not trying to be authentic.\u2019\n\nThe filmmaker previously revealed that years went by between writing JoJo Rabbit\u2019s first scene and the film\u2019s end cut.\n\nSpeaking at Bafta\u2019s Screenwriters Lecture Series last year, he was asked how he finds returning to a script he had written years ago.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve done that with all my films.\u2019 he replied.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d say that most of them, apart from my first one, that was very fast in making that, the rest of them were at least five years between writing the first draft and making the film.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJojo Rabbit is in cinemas 3 January, 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
