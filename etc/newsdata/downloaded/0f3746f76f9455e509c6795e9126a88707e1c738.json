I had the Sunday shift on NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition\u201d desk, and she\u2019d call in the afternoon to prep for Monday\u2019s early-morning analysis segment. But the call was also my chance to take her temperature on the city she adored and the astonishingly productive life she led.\n\n\u201cHi, it\u2019s Cokie.\u201d By the time she phoned, she\u2019d already been on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d gone to Mass, gathered gossip at both places, hit the Safeway, checked email and the wires, revised a book chapter or a speech, and begun contemplating what to cook for dinner with her husband, Steve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having about 30 people tonight,\u201d was a typical next sentence, referring to a legion of family and friends, great-grandmothers and grandkids who were routinely convened for Sunday supper. \u201cSo I have to keep this brief, and I\u2019ll check back after everyone\u2019s gone. What are you thinking about for tomorrow?\u201d I was, of course, wondering how anyone could pull off dinner for 30 on a Sunday night. She\u2019d get more done on a Sunday than I would all week \u2014 and check in on more people than I do in a month.\n\nShe was a centrifugal force, pulling into her orbit Washington\u2019s greenrooms and hearing rooms, its church aisles and carpools, its unsung women and kids and elders and friendships spanning generations and party lines, in a place that, every year, feels more balkanized. (She loved to tell the story of her mother\u2019s arrival in town: Lindy Boggs, then the young bride of a new congressman, would be picked up in a car by dowager congressional spouses once the new legislative session commenced and brought along to meet other wives from both parties.) She took Political Washington and Neighborhood Washington and Historic Washington and Regular People Washington into the studio with her, and shared them with the rest of the country.\n\nEditing Cokie was like peering around the wall at a party of jaw-droppingly entertaining guests. She was the connective tissue between so many communities and, as Spy Magazine memorably diagramed, so much power. And she was impossibly, unfailingly kind.\n\nIn Washington and around the country, thousands of people whose names we\u2019ll never hear \u2014 from the lowliest news assistant to the mom with a baby in the NICU to the colleague with a cancer diagnosis to the friend you didn\u2019t realize had met her husband through Cokie (and then married him at Cokie\u2019s own house) \u2014 have deeply affectionate, personal memories of her. Strangers on social media shared their own stories. \u201cMixed scents of coffee, toasted bread and cinnamon with the voice of Ms. Roberts are how my days started,\u201d read one Facebook reminiscence from a Japanese man. \u201cI always loved it. Thank you so much for your professionalism.\u201d Twitter was flooded with memories and selfies with Cokie \u2014 often pictures of grandmothers and girls in their teens. In a city as transactional as Washington, the breadth of mourning has been genuinely remarkable.\n\nCokie brought something foundational to her audience: the knowledge of, and deep belief in, the laws of the country. Enough of her relatives had been involved getting them written or enacting them or getting someone else \u2014 often a woman \u2014 into a position to do it. She had a taproot to the beginnings of America, right there in her own family, from her Louisiana roots through her long Washington pedigree, and she drew from it naturally, knowledgeably and un-self-consciously most Mondays just after 6 a.m. (Because it was so early in the morning, NPR eventually set up a small studio at her home, which is how audiences got to know about the family basset hound, Abner, when he interrupted a live interview, barking from a nearby room.)\n\nOur country\u2019s history, alongside her family\u2019s, was a legacy she took seriously but wore lightly. She really did see part of her job as keeping the nation\u2019s capital decent and civil and doing the business it was supposed to do, which of course she did with relish. She loved dishing about which high-level officials were real \u201cgirl\u2019s girls\u201d in ABC\u2019s makeup chair and which officials wrote their own condolence notes immediately and sincerely (Condi Rice, Denis McDonough).\n\nShe loved being in the know. Once, on a summer Sunday nearly a decade ago, after she\u2019d mostly moved to ABC News, she phoned around 9 p.m. \u201cThe White House just called ABC and told them to, quote, \u2018Get an anchor in the chair.\u2019 They\u2019re not saying, but I think it\u2019s bin Laden.\u201d The White House hadn\u2019t called NPR, but her tip kept us in the game; we rallied our anchor from bed.\n\nEach time NPR got a new CEO or senior-level manager, that person would be invited for lunch with Cokie, Nina Totenberg and Linda Wertheimer. It was clear to most of us that these \u201cfounding mothers\u201d (as Cokie titled her book on women in the Revolutionary War) together had far more sway than whichever of the latest chiefs was about to take the helm. You got the sense that they were deliberately, and with unfailing courtesy, exercising their powers of intimidation \u2014 scaring the newcomers into recognizing the significance, the meaning, of the network they were being hired to run. She vetted new leadership and read a few honchos the riot act when they promoted people above their abilities, especially if better-qualified women had been passed over. She and the other founding mothers fought to preserve the DNA of NPR. After all, they\u2019d birthed the place.\n\nThere are legions of women in media and politics who are feeling motherless now, in Washington and New York and New Orleans and for all I know dozens of other places she visited quietly but influentially. She leaves so much \u2014 goodness, intellect, integrity, humor \u2014 to live up to. I hope we\u2019re worthy.\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "She pulled Washingtonians of every type into her orbit.", "authors": ["Kitty Eisele", "Kitty Eisele Is A Former Senior Supervising Editor Of Npr S", "Morning Edition", "A Former Nieman Fellow At Harvard.", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ltTe4QKb2GX3U16nc4xNnMl4EVk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5NSDXIELXQI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
