Glioblastoma can be difficult to treat and may require several different approaches including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. With standard treatment, the median survival for patients is approximately 11-15 months, according to the American Brain Tumor Association.\n\nHalbert said that about a month ago she and Jason were informed that the cancer had become more aggressive, and had leaked into his cerebral spinal fluid, lessening his predicted prognosis.\n\n\u201cHow were we supposed to tell our daughters?\u201d Halbert remembered thinking. \u201cHow were we supposed to plan our future?\u201d\n\nBOY WITH TERMINAL CANCER CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS EARLY\n\nThe couple\u2019s two daughters, 18-year-old Kaylee and 16-year-old Ashlee, had always dreamed of their weddings, and dancing with their father at the ceremony, Halbert added, but she knew it was no longer an option.\n\n\u201cThe dreams they had of their daddy walking them down the aisle had come to a screeching halt,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\"So, I asked them what was most important to them and my oldest said she wanted to have her father/daughter dance that she would have had at her wedding,\" Halbert tells Fox News. \"Mind you, she is only 18 and nowhere near getting married, but she picked out her song with her dad at the age of 7 so this is something that weighed heavily on her.\"\n\nHalbert added that her younger daughter had also picked out a song for her future wedding. At that point, Halbert got the idea to \u201cpre-create\u201d their daddy-daughter wedding dances with Jason, as something the girls could look back on after he\u2019s passed \u2014 and the entire family loved the idea.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nPretty soon, family and friends rallied around to donate their time and services \u2014 as well as a slew of wedding dresses to choose from \u2014 to make the moment happen. Shalonda Chaddock, a professional photographer and friend of Halbert\u2019s, immediately agreed to document the bittersweet dances for the girls.\n\n\u201cI have photographed a lot of difficult shoots \u2026 but this one was by far the most difficult to photograph because I know this family personally and I have watched these girls grow up,\u201d Chaddock, who runs Chubby Cheek Photography, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cHaving two young daughters myself, I wanted so badly to capture the perfect images for them. But, as the tears fell, I realized that these [photos] didn\u2019t have to be perfect, they just needed them,\u201d she said.\n\nWIDOW STUDYING TO BECOME A NURSE AFTER HUSBAND DIES FOLLOWING HEART TRANSPLANT\n\nPictures from the family\u2019s daddy-daughter dances, which took place on Oct. 14, show Jason twirling and embracing his two teenage daughters. In one, he even walks them down the \u201caisle,\u201d arm-in-arm.\n\n\u201cThe day of the dance, the sun was shining through gray rain clouds, sunlight mixing with rain showers. I realized, afterwards, how appropriate the weather was for this day,\u201d Halbert wrote of the moment on Facebook. \u201cThat is what we've been doing through this whole journey, trying to find the light among the darkness, the sunshine in the rain.\u201d\n\nMOM SHAMED FOR 'BABYING' HER SON FIRES BACK AT CRITICS\n\nHalbert now says she\u2019s sharing photos from the heart-wrenching photoshoot as a reminder for others to appreciate their families, and as a way to raise awareness for the disease that\u2019s taking her husband.\n\nShe also said on Facebook that she\u2019s hoping to encourage others to \u201cpre-create\u201d moments themselves.\n\n\u201cWhen our girls look back at this chapter, I want them to remember not a journey of death, but a journey of life. Take the trip, snap the pictures, eat dessert first, go see your friends, play games with your kids, make your days matter! When you live your life surrounded by kindness and love, you have lived your life well,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn a statement shared with Fox News, Halbert added that the family has been \"inundated with messages\" from folks who wished they had done something similar before losing a loved one.\n\n\"It's given [Jason's] struggle purpose,\" she told Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the family\u2019s \u201cPray For J\u201d Facebook page \u2014 where Halbert shares updates on her family and her husband\u2019s health \u2014 Jason\u2019s body is responding well to a new round of chemotherapy drugs, and doctors say it\u2019s likely he may have more time than what was discussed in the last prognosis.\n\nA GoFundMe page has also been set up for the family to help deal with Jason\u2019s medical costs.", "description": "\u201cThe dreams they had of their daddy walking them down the aisle had come to a screeching halt,\u201d the girls' mom remembered.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/halbertChubbyCheek2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
