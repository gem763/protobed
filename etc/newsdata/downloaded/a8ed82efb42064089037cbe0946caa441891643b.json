Since it launched I\u2019ve been really curious but I\u2019d never even seen one in the flesh until it turned up week before last. I\u2019d also only ever had a VR experience once for about five minutes with a Google Goggles cardboard visor and someone\u2019s phone a few years ago, so I wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d take to it. But I chanced the motion sickness because I was really desperate to play one particular game. Thankfully, the gamble paid off. I have not been disappointed. At all. Quite the reverse. It\u2019s been a revelation.\n\nThe game in question is Moss. I\u2019m still in the early stages, but the adventures of little Quill are really some of the most captivating gaming I\u2019ve experienced in many, many years. The attention to detail in the environments and the adorable little creatures within them are really something special. So far, my only gripe with it is that I can\u2019t pick Quill up, put her in my pocket and go for a walk in the forest myself just to look around.\n\nThat, and the fact that I accidentally let her fall into a pond at one point and I\u2019ve felt like an evil monster ever since, as watching her drown was utterly heartbreaking. I actively had to stop myself playing it because there was so much to enjoy, I didn\u2019t want to rush through it. I simply don\u2019t want it to end. Surely a sequel is a certainty given its reception?\n\nThankfully I was able to distract myself with Astro Bot, which is pretty much 100% weapons grade fun. It genuinely feels like the true sequel to Super Mario Galaxy. I\u2019m only in World 2 and I\u2019ve already spent hours gawking at the level designs and laughing at all the little flourishes and details that adorn them all. Anyone who\u2019s played it will know about the level that starts on the beach but then things move on when you get to the robot dolphins\u2026 so many \u2018Wow!\u2019 moments.\n\nI also tried WipEout, which was glacially cool, but will probably make my eyes bleed if I play it for long enough and although I haven\u2019t quite built up the courage to try it yet, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s only a matter of time before Resident Evil 7 gets a second play through as well. X-Wing VR Mission will have to be obtained at some point now, no question.\n\nMy only real-world gaming friend was about to join the fun. He suffers with terrible motion sickness with certain games, usually anything first person, but he also often gets it if he watches someone else playing anything third person too. Much to our surprise, the only thing he couldn\u2019t handle was WipEout. He was as taken with Moss and Astro Bot as I was and vowed to get himself one ASAP. I\u2019ve seen some of the things that have made him queasy. It doesn\u2019t take much. But PlayStation VR definitely seemed to agree with him. Basically, assuming it doesn\u2019t make you sick, and you\u2019ve got a PlayStation 4, I really can\u2019t recommend it enough.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve done this one before as a Hot Topic, GC, but how about which games sold you on a system? Was there a specific title you played, or saw, early or later in a system\u2019s lifespan that caught your eye and made you think, \u2018That\u2019s it, I need that in my life\u2019. Were you previously loyal to a rival format and someone else\u2019s exclusives turned your head, or were you reluctant to take the plunge into any given generation and then something snagged you and dragged you back into gaming?\n\nyourhomeisatrisk\n\nGC: It\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve done a killer app Hot Topic so, yes, we\u2019ll give it a go in the future. As for Moss, when we met the developer two years ago they implied they\u2019d made a deal with a major publisher but there\u2019s never been an announcement. We wonder if Sony has maybe signed them up for the PlayStation VR 2, but that\u2019s just a guess.", "description": "The Tuesday Inbox recommends the Switch Lite with free game deal at Tesco, as one reader discovers Star Fox homage Ex-Zodiac.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the_witcher_3_wild_hunt_hearts_of_stone_im_sure_the_lumps_nothing_geralt_but_id_rather_not_diagnose_you_at_a_party_en_1571094720.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
