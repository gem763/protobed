And while I had my reservations, I just couldn\u2019t resist the value prop of learning from someone who has led Vogue for 31 years; has hired and fired hundreds of people; and who is indubitably the most influential and powerful person in fashion, an industry she has spent her entire career upholding and enabling (for better or for worse). Plus, the only new and surprising thing we\u2019ve learned about her in the past several years is that she loves a flip-flop. Maybe, I thought, she was finally going to open up a bit.\n\nThe online course, which promises lessons in \u201chow to be a boss,\u201d begins with that same footage you\u2019ve probably seen in the ad: Wintour, moving coolly through a crowd of rabid paparazzi (Anna, love the hair! Anna, Anna! Stop!), followed by a slideshow of her magazine covers. \u201cAnna Wintour, you are a power,\u201d Christine Amanpour intones solemnly. Cue inspirational music.\n\nIn theory, for $90, the course gives you a dozen classes in \u201cleadership and creativity\u201d and \u201cunprecedented access\u201d into Wintour\u2019s world. It\u2019s produced by MasterClass, a polished online learning platform whose slogan is \u201conline classes from the world\u2019s greatest minds\u201d and which features lessons from the likes of Martin Scorsese and Serena Williams. (MasterClass did not respond to inquiries about whether it recruited Wintour for the course and what its fee structure with instructors is.)\n\nI hadn\u2019t heard of the platform before now, but it looked promising: Anna Wintour is notoriously private, a woman who rarely reveals herself \u2014 here she was offering a chance to get inside her head. Again, I had strong reservations: Part of Wintour\u2019s extreme privacy is her tendency to stay mum on the controversies and criticism she\u2019s received while head of Vogue over the years. That said, I was sold on the proposition that if she was really engaging in lessons on leadership, she might cop to some of her mistakes.\n\nSo I joined the ranks of some 100 other students. A quick scan of the community forum revealed that many of them were, like myself, women working in fashion or media, eager to know if Anna would actually respond to anything in the community forum\u2019s \u201cDear Anna\u201d advice column. She hasn\u2019t yet.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Cond\u00e9 Nast has struggled in recent years, including a $120 million hemorrhage in 2017 that forced it to sell three of its magazines and consolidate departments across titles. And Vogue, once the arbiter of fashion, taste, and culture, has struggled to fend off the forces of indifference from younger readers. Celebrities no longer need it in quite the same way now that they have their own social platforms, and when the news of Cond\u00e9\u2019s shake-up broke in 2017, a few writers addressed the elephant in the room: With the democratization of high fashion via social media and blogging, does the fashion industry even need a magazine like\ufeff Vogue? The answer, mostly, was no.\n\nPart of the magazine\u2019s efforts to remain in the Zeitgeist involve turning Wintour into a brand in her own right and placing her at the forefront of its PR efforts. Take Vogue\u2019s \u201cGo Ask Anna\u201d video series, launched earlier this year and billed as the \u201canything-goes, see-what-Anna-really-thinks video series.\u201d Mostly it gives the impression that taping is being squeezed in in between meetings. (In the latest installment, Taylor Swift asked Wintour such intimate questions as \u201cWhere would you rather live forever, a lighthouse or a houseboat?\u201d) Surely, fashion\u2019s most powerful person has insight on things that matter more than this?\n\nBut the MasterClass, I soon found out, took a similar approach. The advice was banal (\u201cDon\u2019t micromanage,\u201d \u201cBe daring and take risks,\u201d \u201cHave a broad range of experience\u201d), and the accompanying PDF workbook is much the same, with 35 pages of leadership and success boilerplate lifted from a corporate-retreat handbook. Wintour opens the series by recounting her morning schedule, the same one that\u2019s been making the rounds since 2007.\n\nIn an attempt to flesh out Anna, the Human, lessons are mixed with anecdotes from her life as Vogue\u2019s leader: an escaped-peacock snafu at the 2007 Met Gala, or the time a businessman told her he loved Vogue because it was elegant, unlike Madonna, whom Wintour later deigned to put on the cover in an act of fashion-world anarchy. The 1989 Madonna cover \u2014 as well as 2014\u2019s Kimye cover \u2014 is framed as a controversy the editor deftly overcame (\u201cI think there is always a time you know you have to break the rules\u201d).\n\nOther controversies \u2014 her mutually advantageous relationship with Harvey Weinstein, or the John Galliano goodwill tour she launched following the designer\u2019s anti-Semitic comments \u2014 are not addressed. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to understand how your work fits into a much larger cultural narrative,\u201d she says in the session on editorial decision-making, and I can\u2019t help but recall the time in 2012 when Wintour gave Asma al-Assad, the wife of dictator Bashar al-Assad, a full Vogue spread. It was the same year Assad\u2019s regime murdered thousands of Syrian civilians, including children. Evidence that Vogue ever ran the story has been entirely scrubbed from the web (almost).\n\nOther scenes felt like an attempt at reputation management, like the meeting where Wintour says something vague about wanting a spring issue to focus on \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment.\u201d She asks fashion news director Chioma Nnadi how runways looked this season. \u201cIn Europe there was a real embrace of gender fluidity,\u201d Nnadi responds, before going into some contrived hand-wringing over London runways: \u201cIt still felt like the girls were really young and thin.\u201d Wintour agrees, saying she\u2019d \u201chad words\u201d with a number of designers that \u201cwere not well received.\u201d If this was indeed true, it makes you wonder how powerful this woman really is after all.\n\nMuch of the series mirrored this sort of neatly performed wokeness, with videos ceaselessly flashing Vogue spreads featuring nonwhite models as Wintour deadpans about \u201ctaking risks.\u201d But Vogue has, since its conception, been a gatekeeper for fashion\u2019s white, Western-centric taste-making. During Wintour\u2019s tenure, the magazine has had less than a dozen different nonwhite cover models, its 2015 Met Gala exhibit and theme was a cringeworthy ode to Orientalism, and its 2019 exhibit ignored the crucial role queer people of color played in the genesis of camp. In one lesson, Wintour name-checks Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover in its 126-year history. She just doesn\u2019t mention that part.\n\nI wanted this class to live up to the potential it promised: to give me and other hungry, ambitious young women a real shot at learning something from one of the only women of her standing in media. But what we get, like Wintour\u2019s previous ventures in authenticity, is a highly produced branding exercise that serves only to further the mythmaking around her.\n\nIt occurs to me that I was kidding myself all along, though. The course \u2014closed off, superficial, and with a penchant for glossing over anything unsightly \u2014 is how Anna Wintour and her Vogue have always operated. And maybe that\u2019s the biggest lesson here: When all you can offer is an empty gesture, the people who admire you will start to forget why.", "description": "Anna Wintour\u2019s pricey MasterClass is yet another disappointing, empty gesture from the Vogue editor.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/19/19-anna-wintour.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
