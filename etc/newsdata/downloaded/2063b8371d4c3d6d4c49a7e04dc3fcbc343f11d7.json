If the abuse continues, the referee will suspend the game for a period of time. The third and final step will see the official abandon the game.\n\nBut Abraham, 22, suggested that if England\u2019s players believe someone is not comfortable, captain Harry Kane could lead them off the pitch before the three steps are played out if they are not working.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve touched base on how to deal with the situation,\u201d said the Chelsea forward. \u201cHarry Kane even said that if it happens and we\u2019re not happy with it, we speak to the player and if he\u2019s not happy, we all come off the pitch together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team thing. Don\u2019t isolate one person, we\u2019re a whole team. If it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\u201d\n\nDefender Trent Alexander-Arnold, 21, believes the protocols will be followed but that in any potentially threatening situation a different course of action may be appropriate.\n\n\u201cWe need to be professional athletes,\u201d said the Liverpool player. \u201cWe have an obligation to follow the protocols, that\u2019s what we need to do. If it does get to the extreme, maybe different action might be taken.\u201d\n\nAshley Young was subjected to monkey chants in Sofia during an England game in 2011.\n\nThe Bulgarian Football Union was fined 40,000 euros (\u00a336,000) by UEFA for \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d chanting and for the lighting and throwing of fireworks.\n\nAbraham suffered racial abuse online earlier this season, targeted by trolls after missing a penalty in the Super Cup shoot-out defeat to Liverpool.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Tammy Abraham says England are prepared to defy UEFA rules on racism and walk off the pitch if they face abuse during Euro 2020 qualifiers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b4d80c62b531a6f07b50836c7b698b5fc1bcd3ec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
