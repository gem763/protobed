They\u2019ve always accused the pair of being lazy and outsourcing too much work to paid trades rather than doing the grunt work themselves.\n\nDan and Keith have also tipped a bucket (quite literally) over Jesse\u2019s efforts for the opposite reason. They felt the real estate agent had become sloppy because he was trying to do too much.\n\nNever shy at coming forward, Jesse quickly pointed out the hypocrisy in Keith\u2019s scathing assessments of his tiling work. And he has a point. If Keith was to be believed, contestants were foolish to try to do all their own labour and equally foolish if they paid skilled labourers. He can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubting that with everyone\u2019s money close to running out, all five teams have pulled out all the stops this week to present rooms on the cheap. And that\u2019s likely to be the story from here on in, unless one of the many sponsors decides to cough up some more cash.\n\nFor Mitch and Mark that frugality has meant pinching flowers from the neighbours\u2019 gardens to add a touch of greenery to the dressing room Darren extravagantly dubbed a \u201cstrut-in \u2018robe\u201d rather than a mere \u201cwalk-in \u2018robe\u201d.\n\nEven notorious big-spender El\u2019ise has had to rein it in. She resorted to using bargain-basement Margaret Thatcher autobiographies as decorative items in her room. Neale was not impressed. In fact, he felt quite certain, as an Englishman, that El\u2019ise would be the only person on the planet, apart from the late Iron Lady herself, to have the books in pride of place in the bedroom wardrobe.\n\nAndy and Deb took the cost-cutting much further and completely axed their en suite to use the studio solely as a large bedroom. The neutral-hued room reduced Shaynna to tears. In a good way. She felt a connection to the room because it had been \u201cmade with love\u201d. Righto!\n\nLittle did she know that this supposedly tranquil retreat was, just hours before, the site of Deb and Andy\u2019s first big dust-up in 10 weeks on The Block.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re annoying me so much,\u201d the usually laid-back Deb told Andy when he said he didn\u2019t really care that he had painted the walls the wrong colour.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always the attitude when it comes to the styling and the painting. \u2018Everything is crap. Everything is f***ed. Everything is \u2018I don\u2019t care!\u2019 So, I have to do it all. I have to care and do it all.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Deb and the other contestants, they are going to have to get used to doing it all themselves if they are to finish the biggest renovation in Block history with the meagre budgets they were given.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2014 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
