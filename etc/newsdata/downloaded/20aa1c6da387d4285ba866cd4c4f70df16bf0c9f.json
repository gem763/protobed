Ferguson, nicknamed \u201cFergie,\u201d revealed she\u2019s a fan of non-invasive laser facelifts to keep her features youthful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started the laser treatment, but it\u2019s not finished yet,\u201d said the proud mom of Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. \u201cThe collagen needs to rebuild. I hope it will all be done by my birthday.\u201d\n\nPRINCESS MADELEINE, PRINCE CARL PHILIP OF SWEDEN\u2019S CHILDREN LOSE THEIR ROYAL TITLES\n\nThe Duchess of York said she used the same treatment last year to prepare for Princess Eugenie\u2019s royal wedding. People magazine reported the laser lift is meant to work as a natural facelift, stimulating collagen and refinishing skin texture.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the frozen look,\u201d said Ferguson, who turns the big 6-0 on Oct. 15. \u201cI\u2019m so animated and I like to be myself. I don\u2019t like the thoughts of needles and am very glad if I look well and happy \u2014 I\u2019m really happy to be open about what I\u2019ve had done.\u201d\n\nELIZABETH HURLEY MET MEGHAN MARKLE BEFORE PRINCE HARRY DID: 'SHE WAS FANTASTIC'\n\nFerguson admitted that in the past, she has tried Botox. But these days, Ferguson insisted she relies on more minimally invasive treatments. She\u2019s a fan of mesotherapy, which uses \u201cinjections of vitamins, minerals and amino acids\u201d to boost collagen production. Ferguson said the treatment was the right choice for her after years of sun damage.\n\n\u201cI need to repair the damage that was done on the beach when I was a child,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s why I had the mesotherapy, the vitamin cocktail to hydrate and boost the skin.\u201d\n\nAfter that therapy session in 2013, Ferguson said she had a facial thread lift, which \u201cinvolves inserting a mesh of medically advanced threads under the skin,\u201d lifting the face and smoothing away fine lines.\n\nKATE MIDDLETON'S BROTHER JAMES ANNOUNCES ENGAGEMENT TO FRENCH GIRLFRIEND ALIZEE THEVENET\n\nELTON JOHN WRITES QUEEN ELIZABETH SLAPPED HER NEPHEW ACROSS THE FACE IN FRONT OF HIM IN NEW BOOK\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like garden trellising for sweat peas,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cYou insert the threads under the skin with a fine needle and they hold everything up. They also encourage collagen production. It takes a couple of months, then the sweat peas blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore I had it done I thought, \u2018Oh, this is going to be so painful,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t bad,\u201d Ferguson continued. \u201cMy skin responded well. I think if you look at photos of me after I had it done, I look much better.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd her face wasn\u2019t the only thing Ferguson focused on.\n\nAccording to the outlet, Ferguson traveled to the Bahamas earlier this year to have regenerative stem cell therapy on her feet.\n\nPRINCESS BEATRICE ENGAGED TO EDOARDO MAPELLI MOZZI\n\nPRINCESS CHARLOTTE 'LOVES' UNICORNS, DAD PRINCE WILLIAM SAYS\n\n\u201cI think my toes were ruined by all the riding I did when I was young,\u201d she explained, pointing to her big toe. \u201cThey shaved the bone here and implanted stem cells, 20 million of them taken from my midriff, into my feet to make new cartilage. It takes about six months to heal but now I can walk in heels!\u201d", "description": "Sarah Ferguson is telling all on how she\u2019s fighting the signs of aging.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/Fergie-hat-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
