The hope is that by appointing members for fixed terms with protection against removal for any reason except breach of a yet-to-be-announced code of conduct, the board will make decisions without regard to public opinion or Facebook\u2019s business interests. Importantly, it will also be seen to be doing so.\n\nThe board\u2019s decisions might not be any better in substance than the ones Facebook has been making already. Often, there is no \u201cright\u201d answer. And to hope that this body will finally resolve intractable disputes about the proper limits of free speech that have bedeviled lawyers and philosophers for centuries, well before all the added challenges of the digital age, is to misunderstand the board\u2019s purpose.\n\nWhat the board can do is explain the reasoning behind any particular decision or rule. This process of transparent, public reasoning is the main way people in a pluralistic community can come to view the rules that they have to abide by as legitimate. Research shows that people\u2019s feelings about whether a decision is legitimate depend more on the process for reaching the decision\u2014and, crucially, whether the decision is explained by reference to neutral, generally applicable rules\u2014than whether they agree with the answer.\n\nThis emphasis on explanation is seen throughout the charter. In nine pages the charter repeatedly refers to the responsibility of the board to make decisions that are \u201cexplained clearly\u201d \u201cusing clearly articulated reasoning\u201d and \u201cplain language.\u201d The charter also instructs the board to give substantial weight to its own prior decisions\u2014like common-law legal systems do\u2014in deciding any case. This all amounts to the idea that the board\u2019s decisions should be based on something more than mere gut feeling or personal opinion. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a little simplistic for Zuckerberg to write in his letter yesterday that \u201cJust as our Board of Directors keeps Facebook accountable to our shareholders, we believe the Oversight Board can do the same for our community.\u201d While the board should have regard to the community interest, it should not merely be a proxy for public sentiment\u2014otherwise Facebook could just decide these issues by poll. Decisions need to be based on something more fundamental.\n\nThis is the role of the Facebook\u2019s \u201cvalues.\u201d So while the new board and its charter are getting all the attention, the values that Facebook published last week are just as consequential. These values, like the charter itself, emphasize Facebook\u2019s commitment to \u201cvoice,\u201d but note that this needs to be balanced against the need to respect authenticity, safety, privacy and dignity. Importantly, these documents expressly incorporate international human rights norms as informing its decision-making. This grounding in a more widely endorsed set of principles is another bid for broader acceptance of its new rules.", "description": "Deciding which postings to take down is a difficult and unpopular job.
