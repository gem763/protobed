It could be five years, it could be 10 years, it could be 15 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve kind of surprised myself, really, so I\u2019ve stopped trying to have a plan and just accept that every year is a bonus.\n\n\u2018If I didn\u2019t feel like I could win tournaments, I would probably stop because I haven\u2019t got to that point yet where I\u2019m happy to lose.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s going to come a time where I might get on the start line and think I\u2019m maybe 10th favourite to win a tournament, where I\u2019m relying on nine people to get beat for me to win a tournament.\n\n\u2018Maybe that would be the time where I probably think about turning it in. But at the moment, I don\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u2018There are a few of us at the top that are sharing victories so as long as every time I\u2019ve got my hat in the ring, I\u2019ve got half a chance then I\u2019ll keep going.\u2019\n\nThe Rocket certainly has got his hat in the ring after his thoroughly impressive victory in Shanghai last month, where he ousted Kyren Wilson, Neil Robertson and Shaun Murphy en route to the title.\n\nWhile O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s first round exit at the World Championship this year grabbed the headlines, his form has been stunning in recent months and continues to be so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe world number two entered 11 tournaments last season and won five of them, with his Shanghai victory taking his win rate to six from his last 12 events.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan faces Jamie O\u2019Neill in round one in Crawley on Monday evening.\n\nMORE: Snooker\u2019s English Open returns to Crawley in defiance of Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s \u2018hellhole\u2019 comments\n\nMORE: Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s English Open opponent Jamie O\u2019Neill is back on tour after a \u2018four or five year party\u2019", "description": "Ronnie O'Sullivan reckons he could still have 15 years at the top of snooker, but will only continue to play professionally if he believes he can win big tournaments.
