The laundry list of issues includes concerns about the ability of the lead Chinese negotiator to make a deal, reports that China isn\u2019t ready to move on the really big issues, and new U.S. additions to a group of \u201cblacklisted\u201d Chinese companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve noted all along that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for investors to get too optimistic about the talks that start Thursday, because past negotiations have fizzled out when it comes to the two countries agreeing on some of the major bottlenecks. It looks like many investors are going into the negotiations\u2014which start Thursday\u2014with caution. Bonds are up again early Tuesday after falling Monday, and gold is also finding a bid.\n\nWorries are starting to grow because higher U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect in mid-October if progress doesn\u2019t get made. While caution is never a bad thing, it might also not be the best idea to throw away any hopes for a positive outcome, even if it\u2019s not a full agreement.\n\nAt this point, even if we end up getting news that negotiations will continue after this week or that those new tariffs could get delayed, it might be seen as a market-friendly development. If you\u2019re someone who trades daily, that\u2019s more of an issue. Long-term investors probably would be better off not following every twist and turn, and not getting too focused on how each move affects their portfolio.\n\nOtherwise, news looks a little thin this morning aside from some data (more below). The S&P 500 Index (SPX) appears like it might drop below its 100-day moving average of 2928 early today, possibly setting up a test of psychological support at 2900. The 200-day moving average of 2843 remains well below current levels. Volatility is on the rise, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) back above 19 early Tuesday after falling below 18 recently.\n\nNo Signs of Inflation\n\nIt\u2019s still weeks until the Fed meets, but today\u2019s Producer Price Index (PPI) for September and Thursday\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the same month could offer potential hints about what the Fed might be discussing when it meets. PPI surprised with a negative reading for September, falling 0.3%. Analysts had expected a 0.1% rise. It\u2019s just one month, but any pullback in prices isn\u2019t necessarily the best news as far as economic health is concerned. Goods and services prices both fell in September, and the core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, was flat.\n\nSome analysts are already arguing that the negative PPI might be another quiver in the doves\u2019 bow over at the Fed. Though PPI and CPI could play a role in the Fed\u2019s rate deliberations later this month, we already saw that the Fed\u2019s most closely-watched inflation indicator, Personal Consumption Expenditure prices (PCE), barely budged last time out. That, along with last week\u2019s fair but not too exciting September jobs report, don\u2019t seem to show much potential for any kind of major pick-up in inflation. Weakness overseas, the strong dollar, and falling crude prices are other factors that might give the Fed a clear runway to cut rates.\n\nOne possible argument against that thesis is if tariffs start causing prices to rise for U.S. producers. It\u2019s always possible some of the pain might get passed along. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case yet, judging from Tuesday\u2019s report.\n\nMarkets didn\u2019t really show much direction Monday, maybe in part because there wasn\u2019t a heck of a lot of news. What\u2019s interesting is how the SPX continued to play with what some analysts see as a key support area near the 50-day moving average, which began Monday close to 2942. In a setback for any bullish investors, the SPX closed just below that on Monday. That, along with the market\u2019s inability to find more buyers following an early rally Monday could suggest that the risk-off tone persists amid concern surrounding the trade talks.\n\nWhile one day isn\u2019t a trend, something worth noting is how both gold and bonds fell Monday. With both trading near recent highs, you might chalk this up to simple profit taking. Or it might reflect hopes for trade talk progress. However, stocks didn\u2019t seem to get much juice from this bond and gold pullback, which means it might have been more of a technical move.", "description": "Trade talks haven\u2019t even started yet, but stock futures took a hit early Tuesday apparently because optimism is already running out of steam.
