Bernard Sanders has reshuffled his state operations in New Hampshire, where he\u2019s facing pressure for a repeat performance from 2016 when he easily carried the state over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential nominating contest.\n\nJoe Caiazzo, who had been New Hampshire state director for Mr. Sanders\u2018 presidential campaign, is being replaced by Shannon Jackson, an adviser who ran Mr. Sanders\u2018 2018 reelection campaign. Mr. Caiazzo is being reassigned to Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great team in NH and are in a really strong position there,\u201d Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement to Fox News. \u201cThe campaign is now building out our operations to include Massachusetts and Maine state directors as we increase our focus in Super Tuesday states. We are running a 50 state campaign, taking no state or voters for granted and expanding our operations to secure the Democratic nomination.\u201d\n\nThe staffing shake-up also came as Kurt Ehrenberg, a senior adviser in New Hampshire, also parted ways with the campaign.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning there was clear and fundamental disagreement between Mr. Caiazzo and myself on how to run a successful presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. Ehrenberg told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nMr. Sanders holds a slight edge in New Hampshire over former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of neighboring Massachusetts in the latest Real Clear Politics average, but other recent polling has also shown Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden holding leads in the critical early state.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
