Hexo Corp., which was battered last week after significantly lowering guidance, gained nearly 20 per cent to close at $3.81.\n\nIt's never clean from the beginning. There's going to be a lot of starts and stops for the next two to three quarters Roth Capital Partners analyst Scott Fortune\n\nWhile cannabis derivative products such as edibles, vapes and beverages have been legalized, they can only begin appearing on shelves after a 60-day moratorium ends on Dec. 16. Instead of jumping into the market now, Roth Capital Partners analyst Scott Fortune recommends that investors \u2014 especially those with a long-term scope \u2014 wait a few quarters until the market settles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this before in California,\u201d Fortune said. \u201cEvery time you have a new legalization, it\u2019s messy. It\u2019s never clean from the beginning. There\u2019s going to be a lot of starts and stops for the next two to three quarters.\u201d\n\nIn the two months leading up to the legalization of cannabis in 2018, the North American Marijuana Index jumped more than 40 per cent. But after sales began on Oct.17, the benchmark index entered a downward spiral that would see it bottom out in late December. A cannabis 2.0 market won\u2019t follow the same example, Fortune said, as he doesn\u2019t expect stocks to once again run up in advance of sales.\n\nInvestors have switched their mindsets to focus on profitability, he said, something that very few cannabis companies have proven capable of producing. Even with the introduction of new products into the market, he doesn\u2019t suspect that will change over the next three quarters.\n\nEvolve ETFs portfolio manager Elliot Johnson thinks too much emphasis has been put on chasing profitability in the cannabis space. Most licensed producers are still focused on spending to expand their production ability, he said, and that\u2019s likely to continue due to the new influx of product for which they\u2019ll be responsible.\n\nFrom the start, Johnson is focused on which companies will be able to establish brands, especially on beverages and edibles. He\u2019s looking to the market leaders \u2014 Aurora, Canopy and Cronos \u2014 to be the ones who do so first \u2014 and is moving his portfolio toward them.\n\nHexo, in particular, stands out to AltaCorp Capital analyst David Kideckel. The Gatineau, Que.-based company has launched a joint venture with Molson Coors Brewing Co. called Truss Beverage Co that should make it in a front-runner in the drink category. Truss announced on Thursday that it will be ready to launch six cannabis-infused beverages in December.\n\nKideckel reduced his target price for Hexo after the company pulled its guidance and offered a profit warning last week but says his \u201cbull thesis hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201d His new target is $7.25 and he values Truss at $1.21 of that \u2014 or 17 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe think Hexo is well-positioned to capture a good chunk of the market, not only for beverages but other derivative products as well,\u201d he said.\n\nFortune may be cautious on the space short-term, but does see opportunity in MediPharm as a play on the lack of infrastructure in place needed to extract product for the consumer demand related to cannabis 2.0.\n\nStocks may have bottomed, but \u201cnothing\u2019s changed fundamentally about the size and the opportunity\u201d in the space \u2014 especially after 2.0 products hit shelves, Fortune insists.\n\nFinancial Post\n\nEmail: vferreira@nationalpost.com | Twitter: VicF77", "description": "Analysts warn it's still too early to bet on the market's rejuvenation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/aurora.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
