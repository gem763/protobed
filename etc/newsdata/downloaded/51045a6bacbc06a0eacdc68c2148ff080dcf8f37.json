(Gabriella Demczuk/The New York Times)\n\nLAKE CHARLES, La. \u2014 President Donald Trump left a dizzying trail of developments behind him in Washington on Friday evening, swapping the confines of the capital for a fiery rally where he used foul language, fierce political attacks and personal grievances to light up his supporters for the second day in a row.\n\nThe president lashed out at the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, saying that the top Democrat in Congress \u201chates this country\u201d and ridiculing her decision to begin an impeachment inquiry into his efforts to get foreign countries to dig up damaging information on his rivals.\n\nTo the delight of thousands who repeatedly roared their approval, Trump denounced the impeachment inquiry and condemned what he called the \u201cunholy alliance of corrupt Democrat politicians, deep-state bureaucrats and the fake news media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe radical Democrats\u2019 policies are crazy. Their politicians are corrupt. Their candidates are terrible,\u201d Trump said to huge applause. \u201cAnd they know they can\u2019t win on Election Day, so they\u2019re pursuing an illegal, invalid and unconstitutional bullshit impeachment.\u201d\n\nRegarding Pelosi, he said: \u201cShe hates the country. Nancy Pelosi hates the United States of America, because she wouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest political rally came only a day after he appeared in front of supporters in Minneapolis to deliver a profanity-laced screed against former Vice President Joe Biden and called his younger son, Hunter, \u201ca loser.\u201d Trump only briefly returned to Washington, where an impeachment inquiry surrounding his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to uncover damaging information about the Bidens is rapidly moving forward.\n\nIn a head-spinning 24 hours before departing for Louisiana, Trump announced a preliminary deal with China that will forestall a tariff increase, and the Pentagon announced it would send additional troops to Saudi Arabia \u2014 a decision, Trump said before departing Washington, was made because the Saudis had \u201cagreed to pay us for everything.\u201d\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday that the president\u2019s financial team must turn over eight years of Trump\u2019s financial information to a House committee. Separately, judges in three states ruled against the administration\u2019s efforts to withhold green cards from immigrants who receive public assistance.\n\nAnd in a closed-door deposition on Capitol Hill, Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, offered a scathing assessment of the Trump administration\u2019s approach to foreign policy, adding that she believed Trump had personally pushed for her removal for months.\n\nAsked about Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony before he left Washington, Trump said that Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, \u201cdidn\u2019t speak favorably\u201d about her during the July 25 phone call that has formed the basis of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAmid it all, Trump left again for the campaign trail, which he has long employed as a useful conduit for his most provocative language, particularly when he feels the confines of Washington closing in.\n\nUpon landing, he announced the departure of Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, who had publicly expressed frustration with the job in recent weeks. Once the president took the stage in this southwestern corner of the state, he defended himself against those pursuing impeachment, singling out Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nSchiff\u2019s decision during a committee hearing to liken the president\u2019s remarks in the July 25 call to a mobster issuing a veiled threat drew the president\u2019s ire Friday, as it had for weeks.\n\n\u201cHe made it up: It was fiction,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, congressman, are you immune from something like that? That should be a crime.\u201d\n\nThroughout the rally, Trump seemed to abruptly switch emotional channels. He toggled between lashing out at Democrats to acting out an imagined back-and-forth between two former FBI officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, in order to mock them for exchanging unflattering text messages about Trump during his candidacy. He also paused at one point to interview Little League ballplayers about their pitching speeds.\n\nEventually, he circled back to his original purpose for the visit: testing his political influence over local races before Saturday\u2019s primary election, largely following the same attack-style playbook he deployed last month in a close North Carolina race.", "description": "LAKE CHARLES, La. -- President Donald Trump left a dizzying trail of developments behind him in Washington on Friday evening, swapping the confines of the capital for a fiery rally where he used foul language, fierce political attacks and personal grievances to light up his supporters for the second", "authors": ["Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wD3Cvn7z7jPPdqRR8k3paQ--~B/aD0zMDA0O3c9NDUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/feaee59e3020ce242d51331703f5f301", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
