Cats are perfectly capable of living outside, but it also leaves them vulnerable to predators and extreme weather conditions. If this describes your cat, and you want to provide him with some protection from both of these things, a proper bed and/or little house is just the thing you need. While shade is easy to find in the summer, you should be most worried about keeping your kitty warm in the winter. The easiest solution here is to provide a nice, cozy, heated cat bed that is specifically designed to be outside so that the bed itself can withstand both extreme temperatures and precipitation. If you have a cat that does live indoors but spends a lot of time outside, an outside bed will help them out during those freezing cold winter months too. If they are not spending their nights outside, though, a simple heated bed or outdoor cat heating pad is probably sufficient. For the best all-around solution, click here to purchase a great heated cat bed that is both comfortable and stylish! For some other options, here are 10 of the best outdoor cat beds.\n\nBest Beds for Your Outdoor Cat 1. K&H Manufacturing Outdoor Kitty House\n\nThis bed is a great choice because you can get it either heated or non-heated, which makes it very versatile. The heated version uses only 20 watts, and both are water-resistant for worry-free use outdoors. It features two protected exits so your pets won\u2019t be trapped by any other animal or predator that might be after them. It\u2019s a convenient purchase too, since no tools are required for assembly. Water-resistant may not mean completely waterproof, though, so that is something to consider. Some customers have found the inside getting wet during heavy rains. This is a great option, perhaps, if you\u2019re looking for a cute kitty house for an indoor cat with outdoor access.\n\nA great bed for all four seasons, your outdoor kitty will really love this versatile and comfortable outdoor pet bed for cats! The base is ventilated to help prevent water or dirt from building up. This will help keep it cool in summer as well, but the warm cushion will keep it cozy in the winter. It is made from very durable plastic, which means rain can\u2019t wreck it and it\u2019s easy to clean! It will comfortably hold up to 17 pounds, so it may not be suitable for larger pets. The cushion\u2019s material is a little thin, so it might require careful washing. Overall, it is a great bed for an outdoor cat who wants to be comfortable year round!\n\nThis one is an excellent choice for a cat who lives indoors but spends lots of his time outside. Particularly in the winter, this heated cat pad will keep her cozy. The thermal design will keep your cat warm without having to use electricity, and it is very conveniently machine washable. The heat can help soothe sore muscles or joints on sick or aging cats, and the leopard print will be a cute little addition to your back porch. This is not a good choice for protection if your cat is outside full-time. Though it would be a nice addition for her, she will also need a more protective bed or house.\n\nAnother great product from K&H, this outdoor heated cat bed for cats is ideal for any cat spending time outdoors, whether they live out there or not. The floor is heated and will warm to your pet\u2019s natural body temperature when he sits or lies down on it. It is easy to assemble and large enough for any cat. The rugged exterior is durable and suitable for use just about anywhere your cat may like to sleep or hang out. This shelter has only one entrance/exit, so it should probably be placed somewhere that is not accessible by potential predators. It is a great choice for use in areas where extreme temperatures may pose an issue to your outdoor kitty.\n\nAnother great outdoor heating pad for cats, this one is made from incredibly soft foam and will be both warm and very comfortable for your cat. This heating pad is thermostatically controlled and will adjust to your cat's own body temperature when she is using it. It uses only 20 watts, so it is a very safe choice. It is ideal for any covered outdoor areas that your cat likes to chill in. An excellent way to keep your cat warm while they have some fun outdoors in chillier weather, it should not be placed anywhere that is not protected.

The bed has a removable, zip top that can be used to switch back and forth between a bed and a pod in just a few seconds. The removable top makes this bed suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. A simple bed indoors, it can be transformed into something a little warmer and protective for use outside. While it may protect against weather conditions, it should still be placed somewhere safe so your cat will be protected from predators. Versatile, modern, and stylish, this is an awesome choice for cats of all sizes, living indoors or out.\n\nA heated outdoor cat bed with a very unique look, this A-shaped cat house will add a bit of style to your backyard or your deck and will keep your cat protected and warm!

It cleans up easily with the removable cover being machine washable, making it easy to put back together again. It's perfect for use both indoors and out. The doors on this house do attach with Velcro so they will be susceptible to wear and tear over time. Despite that, it will work very well for keeping your kitty cozy and warm during the winter, wherever he likes to sleep.\n\nThis is a great heated bed for outdoor cats and can be placed in areas they like to spend time, such as your garage, shed, or barn. This pad features an internal thermostat which will automatically regulate its temperature to around 102 degrees F. The pad is weather-ready, sealing the components inside to protect against moisture. It would be a great pad to place inside a larger pet house with no heating, and the 6-foot-long cord will make for an easy reach to a power outlet. The pad is plastic, so it may not be the softest sleeping surface. Using a blanket or some type of cover might make your pet a little more comfortable.\n\nMost cats can sit and stare out a window for hours. It only makes sense, then, to give them a nice comfy place to do so. This cat perch easily attaches to your window to provide endless hours of comfy window staring.

This perch is Humane Society-approved and cleans easily with soap and water.
