As per the established CBM, we were informed about the test by Pakistan.\" He was referring to the confidence building measures agreed between the nuclear-armed neighbors.\n\nPakistan's last surface-to-surface missile test occurred in May, during vote counting in India's national election.\n\nThe latest show of force comes amid ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India over the disputed region of Kashmir, over which they have repeatedly clashed since partition in 1947. In February, the countries' militaries became locked in a standoff after India blamed Pakistan for a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed over 40 Indian troops.\n\nPakistan successfully carried out night training launch of surface to surface ballistic missile Ghaznavi, capable of delivering multiple types of warheads upto 290 KMs. CJCSC & Services Chiefs congrat team.
