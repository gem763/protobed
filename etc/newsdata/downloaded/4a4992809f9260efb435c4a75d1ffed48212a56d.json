Matt Gaetz (R-FL) slammed House Democrats for barring members of the Judiciary Committee from attending impeachment inquiry hearings, after he was kicked out of attending the deposition of a witness on Monday morning.\n\n\u201cNot only did Adam Schiff not want the American people to see whatever evidence they\u2019re developing, not only do they not want to let the full Congress see their work \u2014 they\u2019re even barring members of the Judiciary Committee, and based on every review of impeachment I\u2019ve done, the Judiciary Committee is pretty involved,\u201d he told Breitbart News in an interview.\n\nGaetz said he did not know why Judiciary Committee members are not allowed to participate in the hearings, when the Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) was the first to announce an impeachment inquiry and hold hearings. Currently, the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees are running the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if this is just the latest chapter of Adam Schiff\u2019s kangaroo court, or if there\u2019s such diminished trust in Jerry Nadler that our entire committee is now paying the price,\u201d he said.\n\nGaetz said he believes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took the impeachment inquiry away from Nadler and gave it to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) because doing it through the Judiciary Committee was not fielding results.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi has chosen to reshuffle the legislative deck because her Democrats were getting worked silly on the Judiciary Committee following the Lewandowski hearing, the John Dean hearing, it really was not a forum that fielded results for Democrats,\u201d Gaetz said, recalling previous hearings with witnesses Corey Lewandowski and former Nixon counsel John Dean.\n\n\u201cBut just because you don\u2019t like the outcome doesn\u2019t mean that the Speaker and the Democrat leadership should be excluding members who want to participate in a process that could ultimately overturn an election,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nHe blasted the Democrats for making the impeachment inquiry a secret process that has been conducted behind closed-doors.\n\n\u201cThis is not a secret meeting to mark up an energy bill \u2014 this is a secret meeting to discuss and query the reversal of the will of the American people, and they\u2019re not real confident in their facts. If I was confident in the facts, I\u2019d want everyone to know the facts,\u201d he said.\n\nExcluding the Judiciary Committee from participating has sidelined some of the president\u2019s top supporters in the House, such as Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-GA), House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Jim Sensenbrenner (R-NJ), who has experience with Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nSchiff on Sunday compared the closed-door hearings to \u201cgrand jury\u201d proceedings.\n\n\u201cThey are making up the rules as they go along,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like today. Last week it looked more like a clown show, because [Schiff] was selectively leaking material, he was fabricating transcripts for theatrical effect. I guess my question to the chairman would be, \u2018Which part of the grand jury model that you have in your mind contemplates making up fake transcripts for theatrical effect?\u2019 I didn\u2019t read that anywhere in the grand jury regs,\u201d he said.\n\nGaetz also revealed that while the House parliamentarian was looking up whether Gaetz could attend the hearing, Schiff attempted to count that time against Republicans\u2019 time to question the witness, Fiona Hill.\n\n\u201cThis took 45 minutes to resolve,\u201d he said. \u201cThe parliamentarian of course said there\u2019s no basis for that. It shows how determined Adam Schiff is to rig the game.\u201d\n\nGaetz said once the parliamentarian ruled in favor of the Democrats, he left of his own accord.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to make the Capitol Police throw me out by the scruff of my neck,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Gaetz slammed Democrats for barring members of the Judiciary Committee from attending impeachment inquiry hearings, after he was kicked out.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Matt-Gaetz-Kicked-Out-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
