Surv\u00e9, the chair of Sekunjalo and the head of its subsidiary Independent Media, told the PIC commission of inquiry in April that, in addition to the R850m PIC loan, Sekunjalo received a R1bn loan from a Chinese consortium called Interacom Investment Holdings. Lastly, R150m was provided by the Sekunjalo group itself, for the R2bn needed to buy out Independent News & Media in Ireland.\n\nSurv\u00e9 told the commission that the media group had only been making interest payments to the Chinese consortium, and not to the PIC. Independent Media now owes the state-run asset manager an outstanding balance of roundly R1.5bn, given the interest that has accrued on the initial investment, the commission heard.\n\nThe PIC's acting head of legal, Lindiwe Dlamini, told the committee on Tuesday that the PIC has issued a letter of demand to Sekunjalo to repay the loan, and that it is considering submitting a liquidation application to recover the money. She did not provide more information.\n\nA spokesperson for Sekunjalo said the company would be sending through a statement. This article will be updated once comment is received.\n\nPIC commission of inquiry\n\nKhoza told MPs the PIC board anticipates the findings of the PIC commission of inquiry will be \"damning and far-reaching,\" adding the board is committed to restoring \"sound corporate governance and public trust\".\n\nThe commission, appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa in August last year, will release its final report by the end of October. Chaired by Justice Lex Mpati, it investigated the standard of the PIC's internal governance, how it made decisions to invest and potential wrongdoing by senior executives. The inquiry heard evidence, including from Surv\u00e9, over 63 days from early January 2019 to mid-August.\n\nIn an article published on Independent-owned IOL on Sunday, meanwhile, Surv\u00e9 accused Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan of trying to influence the PIC commission to make \"adverse findings\" against his companies.\n\nGordhan has denied Surve's claims, calling them \"malicious and nonsensical,\" while Mpati, who heads the PIC commission, said the allegations of interference have \"no basis in fact\".\n\nSteinhoff\n\nThe PIC is one of the largest investors in the scandal-hit global retailer, whose share price plunged in late 2017. The state asset manager held a 10% stake in the company.\n\nThe corporation originally lodged a litigation process against Steinhoff in Amsterdam, where the retailer is domiciled. But after the retailer's board in April 2019 announced plans to resolve claims against it, the investment corporation opted to delay litigation and wait to see how the mediation process would play out, Dlamini said.\n\nIf the mediation process collapses or is unfruitful, however, the PIC will continue its litigation against Steinhoff, she added. Dlamini said that the PIC had engaged with the Hawks and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority on Steinhoff.\n\nIn the meantime, it will consider a delinquency application against directors representing its interests at Steinhoff.\n\nWhile the PIC has also requested full access to a 3 000-page internal report compiled by PwC into Steinhoff's financials, Steinhoff has refused. The group views the report as privileged and confidential.\n\nFor this reason, Dlamini said the PIC intends to take remedial action against people publicly known to be implicated in the saga.\n\nVBS Mutual Bank\n\nThe PIC was one of the major shareholders in VBS Mutual Bank. The two PIC officials nominated to represent the interests of the PIC on the VBS board - Ernest Nesane and Paul Magula - have now been declared delinquent directors by a high court after being implicated in an investigation into the collapse of the bank. The directors were also disbarred by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, earlier this year.\n\nThe PIC has also filed a liquidation claim with the liquidators of the bank. \"We are waiting for the finalisation of the process,\" Dlamini said. The asset manager said it is also considering \"other avenues\" for adequate consequence management and this includes civil liabilities against affected parties, she added.\n\nAYO Technology Solutions\n\nThe PIC made a R4.3bn investment in AYO Technology Solutions in December 2017, shortly before the IT company listed on the JSE. But commission of inquiry into the PIC heard evidence there may have been major misrepresentations AYO's share value at the time the PIC made the investment.\n\nThe corporation has lodged a civil claim to recover the R4.3bn over what it views as misrepresentations, as well as the flouting of policy processes by PIC employees, including its former CEO Dan Matjila. AYO, meanwhile, is opposing the claim.\n\nDlamini told MPs the corporation is also considering an anti-dissipation order to freeze AYO's assets, as it is suspected they might be moved offshore. The PIC has contacted the Financial Intelligence Centre and the SA Reserve Bank for assistance.\n\nLast week, meanwhile, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority raided Sekunjalo's offices in Cape Town, part of a market manipulation probe which may be related to AYO.\n\nSurv\u00e9, in response, described the raid as a \"tactic designed to focus yet more negative attention on companies that I am associated to\".\n\n\"I firmly believe that what transpired today is a concerted and organised effort to personally discredit me and undermine the organisations in which I have a vested interest, in an effort to \u2018control\u2019 me and the reporting that is carried out through Independent Media of which, I am chairman\".\n\nHe says the Sekunjalo group is planning the sue the FSCA. The authority, meanwhile, says it will oppose any legal action.", "description": "The state asset manager was updating MPs about plans to recoup investments and loans.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2449/13948c1cfc704c37a14d6fe0c8a2363f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
