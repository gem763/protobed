For Mr. Johnson, who has staked his claim to 10 Downing Street on delivering the withdrawal, the amendment was another in a long series of setbacks in Parliament, preventing him from forcing lawmakers into a binary decision on whether to support his plan or not.\n\nThe government plans to press ahead with its Brexit blueprint, forcing another critical vote on Tuesday. But that could also present opponents with the opportunity to try to amend his plan.\n\nAssuming that Mr. Johnson does request another Brexit delay, as he is obliged to do, the European Union would have to decide whether to grant it and, if so, for how long. European leaders would calculate whether to grant a brief delay of a few more weeks to resolve the technical details, or a longer delay to allow a general election or perhaps a second referendum.\n\nMeeting on a Saturday for the first time since the Falklands War in 1982, members of the House of Commons rose, one after the other, to fervently endorse or reject Mr. Johnson\u2019s deal. The debate seemed to be ultimately less about the details of the plan, with its fiendishly complicated arrangements for trade with Northern Ireland, than about whether Britain could finally put Brexit behind it.", "description": "What was supposed to be a dramatic up-or-down vote on the British prime minister\u2019s deal with Brussels fizzled amid parliamentary maneuvers.", "authors": ["Mark Landler", "Stephen Castle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/19/world/19brexit-leadall1/19brexit-leadall1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
