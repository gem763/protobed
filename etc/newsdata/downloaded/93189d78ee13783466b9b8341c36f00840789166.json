One Independent, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, joined Democrats in rejecting the measure.\n\nBut even though the effort failed, it will undoubtedly please Trump as he sees House Republicans rallying around him, a stark contrast to last week when 129 GOP lawmakers voted to rebuke the president over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\n\n\nAfter the vote Monday night, Trump retweeted about 20 Republicans who criticized Schiff.\n\nCensure (at least) Corrupt Adam Schiff! After what he got caught doing, any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest....are you listening Dems? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2019\n\nHouse Republicans have seized on Schiff\u2019s exaggerated rendition of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make it sound like a mob boss shakedown, as well as a New York Times report that a whistleblower sought guidance from an Intelligence Committee aide. Republicans have used this contact to allege without evidence that Schiff, who is leading the House impeachment effort, helped coordinate the complaint.\n\nBoth episodes were cited in the censure resolution, which was drafted by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and has over 180 Republican co-sponsors, including the upper rungs of GOP leadership.\n\nIn the resolution, Republicans said Schiff \u201cmisled the American people,\u201d and made \u201ca mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chamber\u2019s most solemn constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nWhile largely a symbolic move, a censure resolution is the most severe form of punishment in the House short of expulsion. Members who are censured are required to stand in the well of the House while the resolution is read out loud, a form of public shaming.\n\n\u201cEach member of Congress must uphold a high standard of honesty and integrity. When it comes to matters of our national security, that responsibility is even greater. Chairman Schiff has fallen short in his duty,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a statement.\n\nAfter the vote, Schiff fired back at the GOP in a tweet: \"When [Republicans] found they lacked the courage to confront the most dangerous and unethical president in American history, they consoled themselves by attacking those who did.\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi put out a statement supporting Schiff, a close ally whom she tapped to lead the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cChairman Schiff is a great American patriot,\" the California Democrat said in a statement. \"Our country is extremely well-served by his serious, smart and strategic leadership to protect our elections, national security and democracy \u2014 which sadly stands in stark contrast to Republicans in the Congress who cover up the truth, look the other way when the president invites foreign governments to interfere in our elections and vote against legislation to secure the ballot from foreign attacks,\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Republicans have been encouraged by senior members to barge into the closed-door depositions connected to the impeachment inquiry, knowing they will be turned away \u2014 and handed a new talking point that they hope can bolster their argument that the Democrats aren\u2019t being transparent.\n\nAnd House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) got into a heated argument on the House floor with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) last Friday, when he tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to bring up a resolution that would have changed the House rules to allow all lawmakers access to impeachment proceedings and materials.\n\n\u201cYou don't want us to find that out because you are holding all this in secret. Shouldn't we know what's really going on and what's behind this so-called whistleblower complaint that's been debunked?\u201d Scalise said on the House floor last week.\n\nWhile House Republicans are privately concerned as to whether Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine were appropriate, the GOP is in agreement on at least one thing: the Democrats\u2019 impeachment process has been unfair. Members are fuming at the idea of having to vote on articles of impeachment without being fully privy to the underlying investigation. And while a handful of GOP members have expressed alarm with the president\u2019s behavior, House Republicans are overwhelmingly still standing by Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen you sit there and go, \u2018I can\u2019t read the transcripts, I can\u2019t sit in on the meetings\u2019 ... well it\u2019s like [Democrats] have got to do something credible at some point,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada, one of the Republicans who has expressed concern with Trump\u2019s conduct but is frustrated by the impeachment process. \u201cIt\u2019s not even process. It\u2019s hey, build some credibility.\u201d\n\nAs Democrats ramp up their Trump impeachment probe \u2014 which has revealed a steady drip of revelations in the Ukraine saga \u2014 relations between the two parties have hit an all-time low. A bipartisan meeting at the White House last week ended in a blow up when Speaker Nancy Pelosi said to Trump that \u201call roads with you lead to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.\u201d Trump fired back by calling Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician,\u201d leading the speaker to storm out and both sides to dig in even further.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to defend Trump on the substance of the allegations against him, but they feel like they are on firmer ground when it comes to attacking Democrats over process and procedure concerns.\n\nThus far, however, Republicans have failed to make much headway with their attacks on the impeachment inquiry, and public-opinion polls show growing support for removing Trump. Democrats have defended their decision to hold closed-door depositions with impeachment witnesses and declined to hold a vote formally authorizing the impeachment probe \u2014 something Trump and the GOP have been demanding, arguing it happened in both the Clinton and Nixon impeachments.\n\n\u201cWe're going to continue to have what we believe are fair, proper, consistent with the rules, consistent with the Constitution of the United States, consistent with the laws of the United States of America, to find out whether this president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Hoyer said on the floor. \u201cAnd then when we conclude an answer to that question, every member of this House will have availability of all the information.\u201d\n\nStill, Republicans are pressing ahead. Republicans have been firing off a series of letters, starting with McCarthy earlier this month demanding that Pelosi halt the impeachment inquiry until she answer a string of questions about the process.\n\n\u201cDemocrats expect elected representatives to potentially vote on articles of impeachment when most House members currently don\u2019t even have access to the documents produced as part of this closed-door investigation,\" said Rep. Doug Collins (Ga.), top Republicans on the Judiciary Committee. \"It\u2019s ironic that the Democrats adopted House rules this January that specifically prohibit any chairman from doing exactly what it seems Adam Schiff is now doing: selectively leak information while shielding the work of his committee from being fact-checked by other House members.\u201d\n\nEvery single Republican on the House Intelligence Committee signed on to a letter criticizing Schiff for withholding documents and other materials from the minority. GOP lawmakers also demanded in a letter that Democratic committee leaders release the guidelines governing their impeachment proceedings. And another letter spearheaded by Collins requested to review all the impeachment materials, citing House Rule XI, which says all committee records are the property of the House and every individual member.\n\nRepublicans are planning to make a series of floor speeches this week hammering Democrats over what they claim has been a \u201csecretive\u201d impeachment process, according to GOP aides, with members painting the impeachment effort as nothing more than an attempt to undermine the results of the 2016 election.\n\nGOP lawmakers have been attempting to call attention to the process by trying to force their way into closed-door depositions or demanding access to the witness transcripts. Only members of the three committees investigating Trump are allowed to attend the depositions with impeachment witnesses or access the transcripts.\n\n\u201cI want to get to the truth just like everybody else,\u201d Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) said outside the secure room where the House Intelligence Committee meets. \u201cBut this needs to happen out in the open, with full transparency, and right now that\u2019s not happening.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/64/3b03d20f43b19ff01f00c4efd56e/20191021-scalise-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
