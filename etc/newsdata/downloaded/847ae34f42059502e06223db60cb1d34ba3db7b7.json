So far, she remains at the hospital for some special care.\n\n\u201cValentina was born with a heart defect (2 holes in the heart and valves that need to be fixed),\u201d Campos-Duffy wrote. \u201cShe will need surgery in 3-4 months. As we suspected, Valentina was also born with an extra chromosome, which means she also has Downs Syndrome. That extra chromosome certainly made her EXTRA cute. Life is wonderful!!\u201d\n\nCampos Duffy said her other children, who range in age from 3 to 19, are taken with the new arrival just as much as the baby girl\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cWhen we visit with her at the hospital, the kids fight over who can hold her \u2014 I don\u2019t blame them!\u201d Campos-Duffy wrote. \u201cShe\u2019s the sweetest, most perfect angel we have ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe parents expected complications for their daughter. In September, Duffy resigned from Congress to spend more time with his family.\n\nDuffy was part of the Real World: Boston cast and he met his future when both were part of MTV\u2019s Road Rules: All Stars in 1998.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
