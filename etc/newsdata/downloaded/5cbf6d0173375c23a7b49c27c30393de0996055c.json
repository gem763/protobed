Neither of those two things can happen as scheduled because of the strike.\n\nGM\u2019s Bowling Green Assembly in Kentucky was scheduled to start building the new car late this year, and while some production could still occur, the plant won't get up to speed quickly.\n\n\"As we\u2019ve previously stated, Chevrolet Corvette Stingray production begins in late 2019 and convertible production follows in late first-quarter 2020,\" a GM spokesman said. \"It\u2019s too early to speculate on production timing impacts on any of our vehicles due to the UAW work stoppage.\"\n\nBut a person familiar with operations at Bowling Green Assembly said, \"I know for a fact that this strike is directly going to affect the start of regular production for the mid-engine Corvette.\"\n\nThat's because the plant still must fulfill orders for the current model Corvette, dubbed the C7.\n\nThen, the factory must undergo a tooling change to build the mid-engine car, known as the C8. GM had planned to idle the plant this week and next to retool it.\n\n\"That can't happen because the plant hasn't finished production of the current generation Corvette,\" the person said.\n\nThe mid-engine model is the biggest change to the Corvette's design in the car's 66-year history. GM started taking preorders for the Corvette in August and dedicated a \"concierge\" team to answer customer inquiries about the sports car, which starts at $59,995.\n\nAbout 46,000 UAW workers went on strike nationwide at GM facilities at 12:01 a.m. Sept. 16.\n\nThe strike is having an impact on GM production in other ways. On Monday, GM partially idled an engine plant in its Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, because of the U.S. strike.\n\nThe new mid-engine 2020 Corvette Stingray is seen at the Next Generation Corvette Reveal event in Irvine, California on July 18, 2019. More\n\nThat plant is still building engines for vehicles assembled at the site, which is still running. GM builds the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox SUVs at the plant. The partial shutdown impacted 415 of the propulsion plant\u2019s 2,100 employees, the spokesman said.\n\nWorkers install the 2020 Corvette Stingray on the wall at the northeast entrance of the Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit, Tuesday, September 10, 2019. More\n\nLast week, GM idled its factory in Salio, Mexico, that builds its profitable 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups. That impacted 6,000 workers in Mexico.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 workers in Mexico, Canada and at U.S. parts suppliers have been laid off because of the strike.\n\nAfter a week of scheduled downtime, GM's CAMI plant in Ontario, where it also builds the Chevrolet Equinox, was back up running Monday, GM said.\n\nSome Chevrolet dealers remain optimistic that Corvette production will continue as planned.\n\n\"They were supposed to start production in the first part of December, and that's still a ways away,\" said Chevrolet dealer Tommy Brasher, owner of Brasher Motor Co. in Weimar, Texas.\n\nBrasher said he has sold \"a couple\" of the cars in preorders.\n\nFollow Detroit Free Press reporter Jamie L.
