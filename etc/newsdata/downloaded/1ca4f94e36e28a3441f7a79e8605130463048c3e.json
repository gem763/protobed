Why should they not have one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, to be clear, they should have them. If you purchased that AR-15, if you own it, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke. \u201cI think Texas has a real opportunity to lead on this issue right now because we so jealously guard that Second Amendment. We believe in it. We\u2019ll defend it.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke continued, \u201cWe have this proud, rich tradition of hunting, of owning guns for self-defense, for sport, for collection.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Kylee Zempel", "Thefederalist.Com"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
