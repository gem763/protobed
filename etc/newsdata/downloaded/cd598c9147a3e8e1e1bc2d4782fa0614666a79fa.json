But like the run of success he found himself enjoying amid Monday\u2019s series finale with the Detroit Tigers, it came to an end.\n\nThe Tigers struck for five runs off Means to secure a 5-2 victory at Comerica Park and earn a series split in a four-game set between the teams best positioned to finish with baseball\u2019s worst record. Even after Monday\u2019s result, Detroit holds that distinction by 3\u00bd games, with only a dozen games left in Baltimore\u2019s season.\n\nThat means only a few more starts in Means\u2019s rookie season, one in which he established himself as a legitimate major league starter for the Orioles (49-101) after barely making the team out of spring training. Entering Monday with a 2.53 ERA in his five previous starts, Means allowed a leadoff triple to Victor Reyes before Jordy Mercer homered on the next pitch to give the Tigers (45-104) a 2-0 lead.\n\nFrom there, Means needed only five more pitches to finish the first, retiring 12 batters in a row to get through four innings on 45 pitches. But Dawel Lugo singled on his first pitch of the fifth. Travis Demeritte followed with a slow roller to first base, and Means was unable to cover the bag in time for an out.\n\nA botched bunt attempt and a strikeout led to two outs, but Reyes drove in both runners with a double, getting caught in a lengthy pickle to end the inning.\n\nMeans put himself in a tough spot in the sixth, walking two of the first three batters before a single by Brandon Dixon loaded the bases. Lugo\u2019s sacrifice fly ended Means\u2019s outing after 5 2/3 innings, his first time not pitching into the seventh since Aug. 19. Branden Kline stranded Means\u2019s two inherited runners with a groundout.\n\nNote: The Orioles named Matt Blood director of player development. Blood had been director of baseball innovation with the Texas Rangers.", "description": "All-star rookie left-hander yields five runs as teams split four-game series.", "authors": ["Nathan Ruiz", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CV36I6gZTVnoddp8MceB1TJoJxk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3COOZIGY3EI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
