His previous startup, Powa, claimed to be worth $2.7 billion and collapsed spectacularly in 2016 after swallowing up $200 million of investors' money. Insiders detailed reckless spending, mismanagement, and lavish parties to Business Insider at the time. Wagner has never explained in depth how the business went off the rails to the extent it did, but professed ignorance as to the extent of Powa's woes.\n\nHe launched Rezolve a few months after Powa's collapse. Its offering appears to be similar to Powa's, offering various ways for brands to make it easier for people to make purchases on mobile. Late last year, Wagner made a bid for another collapsed would-be unicorn, augmented reality startup Blippar, to build out Rezolve's business. That bid was unsuccessful and a Blippar investor, property developer Nick Candy, snapped up the firm instead.\n\nWright said in a statement: \"I was struck by his energy as a young man and naturally we were keen to assist his activities in Japan. Thereafter we have remained in touch and I have seen his commitment and innovative spirit which he shows in seeking to penetrate the global marketplace for digital platforms.\"\n\nHe added: \"He is keen to build on the company's success in Asia and if there is any way in which I, given my long experience of the region with fluency in Japanese and Korean, can assist him, I am keen to do so.\"\n\nAccording to Rezolve's most recently filed accounts, the business lost $4.5 million before tax in 2017 on revenue of $1.3 million. That was up on a loss of $2.5 million the prior year. Rezolve also revealed that it had made a number of accounting errors in its 2016 statement, including mistakes in its share capital figures and reporting its results in sterling, not dollars. Wagner told The Times at the time that the errors were \"just minor edits.\"", "description": "Dan Wagner has appointed former UK ambassador David Wright to the board of Rezolve.", "authors": ["Shona Ghosh"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a15072e22af00d1597c1a-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
