(Loren Elliott/Reuters)\n\nThe Trump administration on Thursday formally canceled plans to deport migrants with serious medical conditions, including critically ill children, which would have ended the deferred action program for such individuals.\n\nActing Homeland Security Department Secretary Kevin McAleenan reversed the August decision of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to shutter than program for all but military members and their families.\n\n\u201cAt the direction of Acting Secretary McAleenan, USCIS is resuming its consideration of non-military deferred action requests on a discretionary, case-by-case basis, except as otherwise required by an applicable statute, regulation, or court order,\u201d a statement from USCIS read.\n\nThe agency had urged Homeland Security to retire the deferred action program completely, without exception for the military.\n\n\u201cUSCIS strongly believes that the exercise of deferred action is subject to abuse,\u201d a USCIS memo said.\n\nAbout 400 individuals with serious medical conditions had been told they had 33 days to leave the country.\n\nThe move caught flack from immigration advocates and Democrats, who called a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on the decision.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the Trump Administration is reversing its inhumane and disastrous decision to deport critically ill children and their families who are receiving life-saving medical treatment in the United States,\u201d committee chairman Elijah Cummings wrote in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt should not take an emergency hearing by Congress \u2014 and threats for more \u2014 to force the Trump administration to do the right thing,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cOur committee will continue to seek answers about who was responsible for this cruel policy in the first place.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration canceled plans to deport migrants with serious medical conditions, including critically ill children.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Andrew C.
