Finally, she is free from pain + seizures but leaves our hearts shattered. We love you so much Adelaideybug and forever after.\u201d\n\nPeople magazine reported that Adelaide had her first seizure at about 7 months old and was eventually diagnosed with Infantile Spasms.\n\nMiguel told ABC 7 Chicago earlier this month that his family was working to bring awareness about epilepsy. Kelly posted about the family\u2019s journey on her blog, Inchstones. They also worked to raise money for \u201cMy Shot at Epilepsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to ask why these things happen and oh, I\u2019d give away all that I have to have Adelaide here,\u201d he told People. \u201cBut without her condition, we would have never met the strong and amazing people we are surrounded by right now. We have been giving this platform to talk about Infantile Spasms and epilepsy. And we have been given this platform to tell people about Adelaide. And that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do.\"\n\nABC 7 reported that Miguel was \"handpicked\" by Lin Manuel Miranda to play the lead role of Alexander Hamilton.", "description": "The wife of \u201cHamilton\u201d star Miguel Cervantes took to Twitter Sunday to announce the heartbreaking death of their 3-year-old daughter who suffered from a severe form of childhood epilepsy, according to reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/EF6bsV5XUAEltvQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
