For better or worse, such a muted response could signal another turning point for the region.\n\n\u201cIt is enormous,\u201d said Gregory Gause, a scholar of the region at Texas A&M University. \u201cThis is the most serious challenge since the invasion of Kuwait to the status of the United States as a great power that would protect the free flow of energy from the region, and unless there is a big change in the response from the Trump administration I think Gulf leaders will start to question the value of that security commitment.\u201d", "description": "The American hesitation to take military action may signal a weakening of its commitment to protect the Arab Persian Gulf and could embolden Iran.", "authors": ["David D.
