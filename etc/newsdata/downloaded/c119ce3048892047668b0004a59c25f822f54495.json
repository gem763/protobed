I have submitted my letter of intent to [interior secretary Eduardo A\u00f1o] which he accepted and favourably endorsed to the president,\u201d Albayalde said in an address to police on Monday morning. It comes weeks before his scheduled retirement on 8 November.\n\nThe shocking allegation stemmed from a 2013 anti-drug raid in Pampanga province in Central Luzon, when he was a provincial police chief. He allegedly sought to stop the dismissal of officers under him who were found to have taken and hidden more than 100kg of shabu, or methamphetamine, as a bribe from a drug suspect so he could escape. A fall guy was arrested instead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Philippine national police chief General Oscar Albayalde Photograph: Bullit Marquez/AP\n\nA retired police general made the revelation accidentally during a Senate inquiry on another topic. Benjamin Magalong, the retired head of the criminal investigation and detection group, testified that Albayalde made a call to intervene in the investigation of the raid. Senators pursued the matter and another retired general, who investigated the controversial raid, came forward to allege Albayalde told him he \u201cgot a little\u201d from the profits.\n\nThe Senate probe established irregularities in the controversial raid and found the reports the police filed were inconsistent. It also found the police were slow in punishing corrupt personnel. Magalong claimed the officers involved in the raid were given desirable posts under Albayalde.\n\nAlbayalde\u2019s resignation comes after a weekend conversation with A\u00f1o, whom Duterte ordered to investigate allegations against him.", "description": "Oscar Albayalde denies allegations he profits from drug deals arranged by corrupt officers in 2013", "authors": ["Carmela Fonbuena"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a11a6a901f1f7d5152cefa329c0666d3a8f182c/0_34_4712_2829/master/4712.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5c047a5b891acf7f265c19532e51f658", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
