Corbyn opposes the Brexit deal Johnson has negotiated.", "description": "A television report saying U.S. companies are lobbying the British government over drug prices was a topic of debate in Britain\u2019s Parliament on Wednesday in...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU305_johnso_ZG_20191030102524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
