What is clear from this case is that we need better protection, institutions and clearer laws for protected areas,\u201d said Dur\u00e1n.\n\nAdding to the controversy, Pablo Mira, the regional director of Conaf for Valpara\u00edso \u2013 under whose jurisdiction the islands fall \u2013 was abruptly dismissed from his post in September. Mira had been a vocal opponent of the treasure hunt, but Chilean authorities have insisted that his dismissal was unrelated to the excavation permit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 1758 map of Robinson Crusoe Island.

He now reportedly believes that the treasure is hidden in a synthetic tunnel beneath a thick slab of rock.\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Rebolledo, the executive director of Conaf, has said that the necessary evaluations were made in order to guarantee that the dig will not affect the national park in any way.\n\nIf successful, Keiser\u2019s search could put to rest the 300-year-old mystery surrounding the exact nature of the riches accrued by the Spanish sailor Juan Esteban Ubilla.\n\nAccording to historical record, Ubilla accumulated the hoard \u2013 said to be worth $10bn \u2013 on his travels along South America\u2019s Pacific coast in the early 18th century. He buried it in the remote Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands when his ship was intercepted by the British navy admiral Lord Anson in 1714.\n\nThe haul is rumoured to contain original gold statues from Peru \u2013 including a necklace belonging to the wife of the last Inca emperor, Atahualpa \u2013 as well as 800 barrels of gold and silver coins.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In 1704, the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in the archipelago for four years.

However, a mast split in bad weather as they were leaving the island and Webb was forced to turn back and rebury the hoard.\n\nWebb then drew two treasure maps and wrote out coded instructions, one of which he sent back to England. Keiser acquired the second copy in 1998 from the family of the Chilean politician Luis Cousi\u00f1o.\n\nIn 1704, the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in the archipelago for four years, inspiring Daniel Defoe\u2019s novel Robinson Crusoe \u2013 after which one of the islands was renamed in 1966 in a bid to increase tourism.\n\n", "description": "Archaeologists and environmentalists condemn proposal to use heavy machinery to seek 18th-century trove", "authors": ["John Bartlett In Santiago"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/574f0ac5263b4a4c7413242b43dc3153883d1c36/0_168_5421_3251/master/5421.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f00d643d86f6ea0705343b8d6c844d4", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
