For that ruling to be blocked, every country including the United States that attended the settlement body's meeting Monday would have had to reject it.\n\nThe record $7.5 billion ruling found that the European bloc and member states Britain, France, Germany and Spain failed to remove improper subsidies for Airbus that hindered sales by U.S. rival Boeing.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to impose the sanctions starting Friday.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
