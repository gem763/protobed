Here's how you can, too", "language": "en", "text": "For many women in their twenties, saving money and being their own financial advocate can be daunting. And if they are living paycheck to paycheck, it can seem almost impossible to meet certain financial goals.\n\nBut 25-year-old Tori Dunlap says the idea of being financially independent isn\u2019t as far-fetched as many women may think. Dunlap is destigmatizing the way millennial women take ownership of their finances after banking six figures fewer than three years out of college.\n\nThe 25-year-old knows more about finances than you may think.\n\nDunlap was featured in CNBC and The Cut for impressively saving $100,000 in three years.\n\n\"The joke was always, 'As long as I do it the day before I turn 26, it still counts,'\" she told \"Good Morning America.\" \"I was happy I came in actually nine months [prior] to my goal, so I was like 25 years old and 3 months when it happened.\"\n\nDunlap, who set the extreme goal for herself three years ago, decided to do so after reading an article about someone doing the exact same thing.\n\n\"I crunched the numbers, did the math, and realized that would be possible for me. So it was a completely arbitrary goal that I set for myself,\" she said. \"I thought if the other person can do it, maybe I can.\"\n\nShe used different strategies to save the money, including automating her savings so that $20 to $50 got put away every month, setting up an emergency fund and investing early in things like a ROTH IRA.\n\nDunlap grew up with parents who taught her the value of a dollar and helped guide her in any sort of financial decision. Whether it was saving up money to go see \"Annie The Musical\" or starting a vending machine business at age 9, she learned the importance of saving early on.\n\n\"I just saw my parents be really frugal. They not only said to be good with money, but they demonstrated how to be good with money,\" she said. \"It\u2019s really amazing that my parents gave me that gift of \u2026 here\u2019s how to make money, here\u2019s how to manage it and here\u2019s how to run your business.\"\n\nWhile Dunlap was able to save money and reach her goal quickly, she acknowledges that not everybody is like her and everybody has their own set of challenges that they face. Through her own planning and with help from her parents, she managed to graduate college without any debt -- an advantage she readily admits.\n\n\"It is a privilege that I not only went to college, but that I was able to go debt free. With a student loan crisis of over a trillion dollars in student debt, that is something that I really like to acknowledge,\" she said.\n\nNow, after reaching her goal, she\u2019s trying to help other women reach their financial goals with \"Her First 100k,\" a community she founded for women to help guide them to financial success.\n\nOn her website, she advocates for women\u2019s financial equality by helping them build wealth and know what they\u2019re worth.\n\nDunlap teaches other women how to save and budget, pay off debt, have a money mindset, negotiate job offers/raises, price themselves as a creative and build their personal brand.\n\nAnd though she\u2019s not a licensed financial or career professional, many have turned to Dunlap for advice and taken her sessions at different events.\n\n\"I believe I was put on this earth to fight for women\u2019s financial rights. So I don\u2019t think we have any sort of equality, as people of a marginalized group,\" she said. \"Whether that\u2019s women, people of color, folks in the LGBT community, I don\u2019t think you have any sort of equality until you have financial equality.\"\n\nHere are 3 tips from Dunlap on how you, too, can save up money:\n\n1. Invest early\n\n\u201cThat's what grows your money,\u201d she says. \u201cThat's what makes you wealthy. And what gives you opportunities, as far as your experiences in life, and how you want to live it.\u201d\n\nShe also says that smart investing is particularly important for young women.\n\nSo we care about the pay gap a lot with women, and that's something we should continue to care about and talk about,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the thing that we're not talking about is the investing gap, so women either wait to invest longer than men or don't invest at all.\u201d\n\n2. Get a Side Hustle\n\nTo earn some more money for your savings account, you may want to consider a side hustle.\n\nIt could be anything from turning your hobby into to a money-earning business or picking up a few hours a week giving rides or running errands for others.\n\n3. Use the 3-Bucket Budget Rule\n\nDunlap uses what she calls the three-bucket budget rule to divvy up spending.\n\n\u201cThe first bucket is reserved for living expenses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second for goals like retirement or home owning \u2026 those are the two most important buckets. And then anything left over goes into the third for the \u2018fun stuff,\u2019 like travel.\u201d\n\nDunlap says she focuses on priority-based spending.\n\n\u201c[Figure] out what your priorities are in life, what really brings you joy,\u201d she said.", "description": "Tori Dunlap achieved her goal of saving $100,000 in three years.
