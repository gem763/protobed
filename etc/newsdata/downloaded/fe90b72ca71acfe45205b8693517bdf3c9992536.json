REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African business confidence fell to its lowest level in 34 years in August, as a sharp drop in export volumes and a weaker currency aggravated already tough economic conditions, a survey showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s monthly business confidence index (BCI) fell to 89.1 in August from 92.0 in July, the lowest level since the inception of the index in April 1985 when the measure was at 88.1, the business body said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the same set of circumstances as back then, but you are seeing a similar economic climate,\u201d said SACCI economist Richard Downing.\n\n\u201cThis time the main thing is the difficulty government is having in implementing what needs to be done\u201d.\n\nSeven of the thirteen sub-indices in the BCI deteriorated between August and July, four improved, while two remained unchanged, SACCI said.\n\nMerchandise export volumes, the exchange rate weighted against major trading and investment currencies, and share prices on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange were the most negative contributors.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most industrialised economy recorded a surprise 3.1% expansion in the second quarter after contracting by the same margin in the first quarter following a sector-wide slowdown driven by power outages.\n\nBut the economic growth outlook remains meek amid lack of clarity and progress on reforms.\n\nOn Tuesday ratings firm Moody\u2019s, the last of the top-three credit agencies to rate the country\u2019s sovereign debt at investment grade, warned of the risk of ongoing uncertainty and the slow pace of reforms, especially at cash-strapped power utility Eskom.[nL5N261288]", "description": "South African business confidence fell to its lowest level in 34 years in August, as a sharp drop in export volumes and a weaker currency aggravated already tough economic conditions, a survey showed on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428641965&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0P9-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
