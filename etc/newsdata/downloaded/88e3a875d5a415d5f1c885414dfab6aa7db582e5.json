But what to do with the leftovers? | Coco Khan", "language": "en", "text": "My boyfriend told me I ought not to give a chicken such power over my wellbeing\n\nBefore checking out of our family holiday let, a minor disagreement broke out. The opponents: my boyfriend and my mother. The dispute: what to do with the remaining food. He argued that we should bin it \u2013 you can\u2019t force yourself to eat when full. She argued that we should try: wasting food is gross, and we\u2019d be less hungry later.\n\nThey turned to me expectantly. I had become the referee.\n\nI could see both sides. Mum\u2019s thinking reflects the way I was raised \u2013 with a scarcity mindset. If you don\u2019t know when the next resource might appear, you\u2019re compelled to use everything when you have it. But there\u2019s more to it than that. Yes, we learned that every penny counts, but we were never discouraged from enjoying life. It was about spending on things we genuinely wanted (a nice early dinner) and not frittering idly (airport sandwiches). I guess you could call it the art of \u201cmindful spending\u201d (also: \u201cnot being a mug\u201d).\n\nThat said, I have self-flagellated many times on the altar of waste. Once, I phoned my boyfriend, miserable about working late. \u201cI was supposed to cook the chicken,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to spoil.\u201d He told me I ought not to give a chicken such power over my wellbeing.\n\nFrom cat videos to karaoke, I've decided to embrace silliness | Coco Khan Read more\n\nBack to the debate. Part of adulthood is learning to balance competing interests, but this is a muscle I\u2019ve only just begun to flex. I am not a mother, an older sibling, or a line manager. The responsibility to adjudicate rarely falls to me.\n\nI did what any proper adult would do. I weighed up who I was more scared would kick off (both! In different ways!) and solved it by wrapping everything in kitchen paper and carrying it around \u201cjust in case\u201d. Sure, at one point I found melted cheese all over my favourite bag, but you can\u2019t put a price on peace.", "description": "My boyfriend told me I ought not to give a chicken such power over my wellbeing", "authors": ["Coco Khan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b30d7e8d6c71a28fb942a9e9f7485e9d6b3d5205/44_444_4467_2680/master/4467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=131dd70c492b28e52ff9ad6004be0eeb", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
