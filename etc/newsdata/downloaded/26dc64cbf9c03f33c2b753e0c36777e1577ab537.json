When she arrives, she attempts to kiss Mitchell, but he pushes her away \u2014 and she notices his odd behaviour.\n\nShe confides in Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe) about Mitchell\u2019s lack of interest in her, and \u2014 this conversation proves rather useful \u2014 as Cleo devises a way of putting the spark back in their relationship.\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nHowever, things don\u2019t go according to plan \u2014 and Mitchell later admits to Scott that sleeping with Cleo would feel like he\u2019s cheating on Anita, and thus he decides to break up with Cleo as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the week, Mitchell and Anita sneak into the florist \u2014 but they\u2019ve no idea of the dangers that are lurking outside. Yes, Cindy Cunningham\u2019s (Stephanie Waring) building work spirals out of control, as Breda (Moya Brady) crashes into the cranes \u2014 which results in a crack being formed in the village floor. Matters are then made worse, as Luke (Gary Lucy) gets involved in the commotion.\n\nScott and Anita realise what\u2019s going on when they set their sights upon the emergency services, and thus they attempt to get out of dodge. However, this proves difficult, as the door is jammed shut!\n\nWill the pair be able to escape in time?\n\nOr will they become victims of the wreckage?\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 29th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mitchell makes a huge decision in regards to his relationship with Cleo, as him and Scott are caught up in the village disaster.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-HOLLYOAKS-STUNT-06-367f_1572004226.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
