And without missing a beat, the left began its familiar smear attack. On Thursday night, Rachel Maddow grossly misrepresented a law journal article that Menashi wrote in order to paint him as a bigot. As I wrote in this space last week, Maddow deliberately ignored the context of Menashi\u2019s article\u2014which was a defense of Israel\u2019s legitimacy as a Jewish homeland\u2014in launching her unfounded attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now the smears continue, the latest one coming from CNN. More unfair distortions of the record of an extremely qualified individual with a shining academic record and legal resume.\n\nTo remind everyone, Menashi is an honors graduate of Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School. He clerked for D.C. Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg and then for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. In private practice at Kirkland & Ellis LLP in New York, Menashi was an appellate litigator.\n\nMenashi is also an accomplished academic. After fellowships at Georgetown and NYU, he was hired as an assistant professor at Scalia Law School at George Mason University. Menashi\u2019s scholarship has been published in leading law journals, including the Fordham Law Review, theNotre Dame Law Review, and the University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law. In 2017, Menashi took a leave of absence from Scalia Law School to serve as Deputy General Counsel and Acting General Counsel of the Department of Education. Currently, Menashi works in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMenashi follows in the footsteps of the smeared but distinguished Trump nominees coming before him\u2014Amy Coney Barrett, Brian Buescher, Neomi Rao, Ken Lee, and of course, Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2014to name a few.\n\nThe left will look for material wherever they can find it to twist and misrepresent: law review articles, college newspaper columns\u2014even high school yearbooks. In the case of Menashi, it has principally turned to his writings as a columnist and editor of the Dartmouth Review while he was a college student, and a few pieces he authored after graduating.\n\nA survey of Menashi\u2019s writings from the time he was at Dartmouth reveals him to be a thoughtful, measured intellectual. In his pieces, Menashi went to great lengths to fairly frame issues and include quotes from individuals holding opinions different than what the pieces sought to argue. Where Menashi did express opinions in his writings, he discussed controversial issues with civility. He thoughtfully included poll data and observations from the culture at large to bolster arguments that he made. Judicial temperament? Check.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut rather than highlight Menashi\u2019s thoughtfulness or temperament as a young writer, CNN runs the same play that we\u2019ve seen time and time again with respect to Trump judicial nominees: dig for quotes about hot button issues and pull them out of context (bonus points if they are from college!), so that the nominee appears to be an extremist ideologue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor that reason, it\u2019s worth specifically nothing the inaccuracies and distortions in CNN\u2019s piece:\n\nTake Back the Night Marches/Male Stereotyping\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting Christina Hoff Sommers\u2019s arguments in her book, The War Against Boys, Menashi\u2019s editorial refutes the notion that men are complicit in the oppression of females by virtue of their sex alone. The editorial notes that Dartmouth had just been named as one of the \u201c10 most anti-male schools in America\u201d and states that this is \u201cunsurprising\u201d given proposals from the Dartmouth administration to make fraternities co-ed and the fact that the Dartmouth Women\u2019s Center seems to consider \u201cmost\u201d students to be \u201cheteropatriarchal gynophobes.\u201d The editorial resists what it believed to be a central idea of women\u2019s marches at the time, which was that \u201cevery man\u2019s a potential rapist.\u201d\n\nLGBTQ Issues\n\nMenashi\u2019s Dartmouth Review column, \u201cMatters of Life and Death,\u201d written in reaction to the deaths of Matthew Shepard and Jesse Dirkhising, repeats an argument that had been made by Andrew Sullivan (an openly gay journalist) in the New Republic about the two murders (\u201cUs and Them,\u201d New Republic, April 2, 2001). Like Menashi, Sullivan criticized the Human Rights Campaign both for its response to the two cases and for seeming to confirm stereotypes. Sullivan wrote:\n\nThe leading gay rights organization, the Human Rights Campaign\u2014which has raised oodles of cash exploiting the horror of Shepard\u2019s murder\u2014has said nothing whatsoever about the Dirkhising case. For the HRC, the murder of Jesse Dirkhising is off-message. Worse, there\u2019s a touch of embarrassment among some gays about the case, as if the actions of this depraved couple had some connection to the rest of gay America. Don\u2019t these squeamish people realize that, by helping to hush this up, they seem to confirm homophobic suspicions that this murder actually is typical of gays?\n\nIn the piece, Menashi does not suggest any correlation between homosexuality and violent behavior but instead explicitly wrote, \u201cthe murder only reflects on the two contemptible individuals who slaughtered a 13-year-old boy\u201d and that \u201c[t]he notion that this murder somehow establishes a widespread correlation between homosexuality and homicidal tendencies is, to say the least, unfounded.\u201d It is, in fact, the main point of Menashi\u2019s editorial that the crime does not reflect on gays or any other group.\n\nCNN also references an article Menashi wrote in American Enterprise in 2000 entitled \u201cDouble Dorm Standards.\u201d The article does not pass judgment either way on the military\u2019s then operative \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy. Instead, it discusses the hypocrisy of college administrators who on the one hand oppose the policy and \u201cinsist troops in mortal combat should be able to handle the tension of living in mixed quarters,\u201d but who simultaneously establish separate campus housing for LBGT students. Does CNN disagree with the Tufts University president quoted in the article that such separation on campus \u201cflies in the face of the fact that many of us have been engaged in trying to change military policy on gays. If students can\u2019t live in this situation, what will they do in the military, living with someone who is not gay?\u201d\n\nMulticulturalism and Race\n\nAt a tender age, Menashi recognized that political correctness and identity politics were divisive and destructive forces that imperil both liberal democracy and academic freedom. In fact, Menashi supported students learning about foreign cultures and non-Western languages. But students hadn\u2019t been, which suggested the academic emphasis on multiculturalism was not really about learning about other cultures but about promoting a certain political view. In his 2002 essay for Doublethink, Menashi wrote:\n\nAcademic multiculturalism, for one, has been exposed as thoroughly bankrupt. The country would be aided in its current effort, certainly, if its students were familiar with other cultures, conversant in Arab history, and knowledgeable about Islamic law. But in fact they know very little of substance about other cultures\u2026\n\nThe promotion of particular political views was the heart of Menashi\u2019s concern with college pre-orientation programs for minority students, which had become popular at the time. Menashi\u2019s column on the subject argues that such programs discourage alternative points of view. Menashi wrote, \u201cIt seems . . . that intellectual freedom is no longer in vogue at American universities.\u201d\n\nMenashi\u2014himself a descendent of relatives who faced persecution for their ethnicity and faith (his maternalgrandmother survived a violent pogrom in Baghdad)\u2014showed sensitivity for minorities while still fighting against the Ivy League PC-ethos. Writing about several controversial Dartmouth fraternity parties, Menashi urged that Greek organizations should not be required to reflexively apologize for alleged offenses just because some students claimed them to be culturally insensitive or racist. Menashi suggested that, without a complete evaluation of the claims and controversy, it had the effect of degrading more serious claims of racism and bigotry: \u201cWhen students cannot evaluate claims of racism and sensitivity, and instinctively apologize whenever minority groups object, liberal education\u2014not to mention rational discourse\u2014suffers.\u201d\n\nIn defending the parties, Menashi vigorously advocated for freedom of speech and freedom of thought at Dartmouth. The environment at Dartmouth at the time was one that devalued the importance of freedom of thought and expression; campus speech codes were in vogue. Menashi believed it was imperative to stand up for the First Amendment, which was under broad attack at the time. Menashi rightly recognized that protecting all speech included protecting speech that is viewed by many to be offensive or unsavory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a staff editorial for the Dartmouth Review that he authored in 2001, entitled, \u201cTolerance at Dartmouth,\u201d Menashi wrote: \u201c[P]art of living in a diverse community is coming into contact with people whose opinions and rhetoric are different, unsettling, and yes, even offensive. To restrict what can be thought and said, however, is to destroy the free expression of ideas on which liberal education rests.\u201d And while it might not be obvious to today\u2019s modern reader that a luau or \u201cghetto party\u201d implicates free speech concerns, a contemporaneous New York Times article about fraternity life at Dartmouth explained that fraternities had changed over decades from establishment institutions to enclaves of \u201cresistance to political correctness.\u201d\n\nThe CNN piece distorts another Menashi article by suggesting he was defending the \u201cghetto party\u201d by writing, \u201cno one carried toy guns and only person had sported an afro.\u201d On the contrary, Menashi was correcting misstatements made by Bill Maher on his program, Politically Incorrect. Maher had reported that the attendees of the \u201cghetto party\u201d had \u201cplayed rap music,\u201d \u201cworn afros,\u201d and \u201ccarried toy guns.\u201d Menashi explains that there were no guns and only one afro\u2014not multiple. (The AP story that CNN cites also incorrectly reports that there were toy guns at the party.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuman Rights\n\nCNN cites a 2002 Washington Times book review in which Menashi defended the following quotation from Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi: \u201cWe must be aware of the superiority of our civilization, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights, and in contrast with Islamic countries respect for religious and political rights.\u201d Throughout the reviewed book, The Survival of Culture: Permanent Values in a Virtual Age, the authors addressed the issue of cultural relativism, \u201cthe most conspicuous example\u201d of which was \u201cthe brouhaha surrounding\u201d Berlusconi\u2019s remark, which was made soon after 9/11 and denounced by European politicos even though Menashi asserted he had \u201cstated the obvious.\u201d\n\nCNN suffers from the same malady if it is suggesting \u201crespect for religious and political rights\u201d and other human rights is not superior to a system in which they are absent. Even Berlusconi\u2019s retraction of the comment, which CNN mentions as if to try to reinforce its weak position, spoke more to context\u2014of course, the fight against terror depended on the help of \u201cmoderate Arab countries\u201d\u2014but as CNN then reported, he reiterated, \u201cThose who see an enemy in freedom of religion and cultural diversity are themselves our enemies.\u201d\n\nMenashi\u2019s concern, of course, is that such rights are protected, which they certainly are not in many parts of the world. The same book review referenced the British commentator David Pryce-Jones \u201ctak[ing] on the European Union for abandoning the democratic ideals that are Europe\u2019s heritage.\u201d Another 2002 book review by Menashi criticized an author who would have had \u201cAmerican power . . . divorce itself from a special concern for human rights.\u201d Human rights remained a concern when Menashi penned his 2010 law review article\u2014the one Rachel Maddow grossly misrepresented\u2014about how the establishment of Israel, a nation-state, reflected the best way to advance \u201cthe aspirations of liberal democracy\u201d after other means of advancing liberal democracy had failed in the face of \u201cthe worst human-rights crisis in history.\u201d\n\n***\n\nSteve Menashi is a good and decent man who doesn\u2019t deserve CNN\u2019s attempted character assassination\u2014as any fair reader will readily see. The \u201cbig lie\u201d is the only weapon his opponents have left since truth is their enemy.
