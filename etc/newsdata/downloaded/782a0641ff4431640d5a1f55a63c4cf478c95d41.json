He is also accused of exposing himself to a painter he had hired. He has denied the allegations.\n\nAB (@AB84) Thank you for the opportunity @Patriots #GoWinIt\n\nEarlier Friday, Patriots coach Bill Belichick briefly addressed Brown before cutting short his regular media availability amid repeated questions on the receiver.\n\n\u201cWe take all the situations with our team very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some things we are looking into but I\u2019m not going to have any comment on the off-the-field situations.\u201d\n\nAsked if he expected Brown to play Sunday against the New York Jets, Belichick said, \u201cHe\u2019s on our roster.\u201d\n\nBut when more questions about Brown followed, the coach walked out.\n\nPatriots on NBCSB (@NBCSPatriots) Following several questions about Antonio Brown, Bill Belichick ends his press conference after just a few minutes pic.twitter.com/TIFNePYPY8\n\nBrown\u2019s second accuser came forward in an SI.com story published earlier this week. The woman who was hired to paint by Brown says she \u201creceived a group text message that appeared to come from the same phone number Brown provided to her in 2017. The text chain, with four other phone numbers on it, included photos of her and her children, with the person she believes is Brown encouraging others in the group to investigate the woman. The texter accused the artist of fabricating her account of the 2017 incident for cash.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old Brown, who became one of football\u2019s most prolific offensive players with the Pittsburgh Steelers, was traded to Oakland in March but signed a contract with New England on Monday afternoon following a tumultuous offseason that culminated with his release from the Raiders without having played a single game for the team. Brown recorded 686 catches and 9,145 receiving yards over the past six seasons with the Steelers, the highest totals for a receiver over a six-year span in NFL history.\n\nHe caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown on Sunday in his only game for the Super Bowl champions.", "description": "The Super Bowl champions released the embattled wide receiver on Friday amid multiple allegations of sexual misconduct", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55027bc73a58ec9b9587a44fd2d9aeb3df178d73/0_0_2207_1325/master/2207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=637e998fa9fd382fc43630d06a207aaf", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
