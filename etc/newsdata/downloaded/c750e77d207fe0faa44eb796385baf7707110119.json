It has no basis in logic or need, damages America's interests and tarnishes her values.\"\n\nTom Brenner/Reuters, FILE\n\nAdministration officials said the drastic reduction was necessary so that the U.S. could focus on border operations and reducing a massive backlog of legal cases of people seeking asylum in the U.S.\n\n\"At the core of the Trump administration's foreign policy is a commitment to make decisions based on reality, not wishes, and to drive optimal outcomes based on concrete facts,\" the administration wrote in its notification to Congress.\n\nEric Gay/AP\n\nAccording to the United Nations Refugee Agency, the world is facing a record number of people -- nearly 71 million -- who have been forced to leave their homes. Among them, nearly 26 million are designated refugees and more than half of the refugees are under age 18.\n\nKen Cuccinelli, the acting chief of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the cap \"takes into account our existing and anticipated humanitarian workload on all fronts and fulfills our primary duty to protect and serve U.S. citizens.\"\n\nTrump has cut the number gradually each year. In 2016, President Barack Obama's last year in office, the cap was 85,000. Trump cut it in 2017 to 50,000, then 45,000 in 2018 and 30,000 this year.\n\nThe cap is the lowest ever since the program was created in 1980.\n\nIn addition to being drastically cut, the new cap sets more specific and narrow limits on the types of permitted refugees. Unlike previous years where admissions were set based on geography, the administration has now carved out separate admissions caps for religious refugees and refugees impacted by the Iraq War.\n\nThe administration also designates that the U.S. will accept 1,500 refugees in 2020 from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. That number would just be a fraction compared to the tens of thousands of migrants from Central America who are arriving at the U.S. border each month.", "description": "The Trump administration plans to cap the number of refugees allowed in the U.S. next year at 18,000, the lowest number in decades.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Ken-Cuccinelli-ap-ps-190926_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
