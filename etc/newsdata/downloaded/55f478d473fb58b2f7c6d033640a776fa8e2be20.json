Pinkerton, also recently donated $1,000 to the political action committee, according to Federal Election Committee reports.\n\nNone of the top airline executives donated to the PAC prior to this upcoming election cycle, and marks the first time the three have not been associated with political action committees that equally contribute money to both Democrats and Republicans alike, according to the travel industry web site Skift.\n\nOn the labor side of the airline industry, groups have started to donate money to the conservative PAC as well.\n\n2019 Travel PAC Donations to Responsibility and Freedom Work PAC\n\nAirlines For America (A4a) PAC $5,000 Southwest Airlines Co.

Railroad and seaport operation groups are also contributing.\n\nAsked by Skift as to the significance of the aviation industry\u2019s recent unilateral support of Republican candidates, several top airline executives relayed that they will continue to fund political campaigns that further support the industry's corporate interests.\n\n\u201cSouthwest has adopted a policy that it will primarily use its affiliated political action committee, the Southwest Airlines Co. Freedom Fund (Freedom Fund), which is financed through voluntary Employee contributions, to support political campaigns, and that Company funds will be limited to supporting selected political campaigns at the state and local level in compliance with the laws of the relevant states and localities,\u201d a Southwest Airlines representative said in a recent statement.\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cAll political campaign contributions from the Freedom Fund or by the Company directly are approved by the Senior Vice President of Governmental Affairs and Real Estate and overseen by Southwest\u2019s Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer, with an annual summary of those contributions provided to the Southwest Board of Directors. All political contributions are intended to promote the interests of the Company and are not guided by any private political preferences of any Employee.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAt United Airlines a spokesman wrote that \u201cUnited Airlines employees are welcome to make political donations on their own behalf with their own money.\u201d", "description": "Three top airline CEOs are starting to donate to a right-leaning political action committee for the upcoming election.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/American-Airlines.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
