But few of those involved in the early clashes had protective helmets and respirators used by more hardcore frontliners.\n\nTensions built early on Sunday afternoon as riot police flooded the harbourside park where the unsanctioned rally was due to take place.\n\nOfficers stopped and searched numerous people, sparking confrontations as the crowds got bigger, many of them shouting \u201cblack cops\u201d and \u201ctriads\u201d at the police.\n\nTear gas, pepper spray and some rubber bullets were fired in at least three different locations as clashes broke out and crowds scattered.\n\nSmall groups of hardcore protesters then built barricades and blocked roads in a familiar game of cat and mouse with police.\n\nSome used metal fencing from nearby luxury malls to block the \u201cAvenue of Stars\u201d, a famous waterfront promenade.\n\nPolice said some of their officers were attacked with \u201chard objects and umbrellas\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Months of unrest \u2013\n\nHong Kong has been battered by nearly five months of huge and frequently violent pro-democracy protests which Beijing and its local leaders have taken a hard line against.\n\nWith no political solution on the table, the city\u2019s police force have been largely left to deal with the protesters, becoming increasingly loathed by the pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nHardcore protesters have hurled petrol bombs and bricks, vandalised pro-Beijing businesses and assaulted people who disagree with them.\n\nProminent pro-democracy figures have also found themselves the targets of attacks by gangs of men, decimating the international finance hub\u2019s once solid reputation for stability and safety.\n\nIn the last few days, protests have not been as large or violent as earlier this month when some of the most sustained clashes took place.\n\nBut smaller \u201cflashmob\u201d protests have remained a near daily phenomenon.\n\n\u201cIt may look like less people are coming out but it\u2019s just that everyone is using different methods to support the movement,\u201d said a 23-year-old protester, who gave her surname Chan.\n\nA teenaged protester, who declined to give his name, said many felt they had to keep hitting the streets because few of their demands had been met.\n\n\u201cWithout genuine universal suffrage and democracy, this will happen again and we will have to fight again in the future,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do worry about being arrested. But I have prepared my last words and have left them at home,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the demands from protesters is an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 2,500 arrested and fully free elections \u2014 all of which have been refused by Beijing and chief executive Carrie Lam.\n\nThe one concession made so far has been to scrap a widely loathed plan to allow extraditions to the mainland \u2014 an issue that sparked record-breaking protests earlier in the year before the movement morphed into a wider anti-government revolt.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets on Sunday at pro-democracy protesters who defied authorities to hold a rally on Hong", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/8ae32a_clouds-acrid-smoke-wafted-streets-packed-tourists-including-landmark-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
