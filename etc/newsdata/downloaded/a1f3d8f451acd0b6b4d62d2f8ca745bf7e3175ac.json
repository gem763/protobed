Officials expect many residents to be left homeless. As the storm approached, most people went to shelters, tourist hotels shut down, and residents boarded up their homes. As of the country\u2019s 2000 census, Grand Bahama Island had a population of 46,994 and the island chain, overall, was populated by 303,611 residents.\n\n\"A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 18 to 23 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds on Grand Bahama Island,\" the NHC warned Monday. \"Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves. Water levels should very slowly subside on the Abaco Islands during the day.\"\n\nThe NHC predicted 12 to 24 inches of rainfall in Northwestern Bahamas through the end of the week, with 30 inches possible in isolated areas. The Carolina coast may get 5-10 inches, with 4-8 inches for the Florida and Georgia coast.\n\n\"This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods,\" the NHC said.\n\nThe east-central coast of Florida could even see isolated tornadoes, forecasters warned.\n\nForecasters predict Hurricane Dorian is expected to begin pulling away from The Bahamas early Tuesday, turning north along the southeastern coast of the United States. The storm is expected to stay near the shoreline, hitting coastal towns with dangerous winds and heavy surf. Authorities continue to warn that Dorian could still make landfall.\n\n\"Tropical-storm-force winds are mostly likely to start in Georgia early on Wednesday, in South Carolina late Wednesday, and in North Carolina early Thursday,\" the National Hurricane Center tweeted Monday morning.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a mandatory evacuation order for his state\u2019s 830,000 coastal residents, which is scheduled to take effect at noon Monday. Authorities in Florida similarly ordered evacuations for vulnerable coastal areas and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina has warned his state of possible heavy rain, wind and floods later in the week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Hurricane Dorian continued to head west at 1 mph with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/NWS-DORIAN.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
