(Reuters)\n\nJason Myers missed a 48-yard field goal, and the Rams answered by scoring touchdowns to close the first half and open the second, taking control of the game.\n\nBut Wilson\u2019s fourth touchdown pass of the night with 2:28 remaining into the bobbling hands of Chris Carson was the final shot of the night, giving the Seahawks a lead they would not relinquish.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe scoring drive was aided by a controversial roughing call on Clay Matthews when he hit Wilson as he threw the ball away with what looked like a legal shoulder-to-shoulder blow, giving Seattle a first down on the Rams 25-yard line.\n\nRams\u2019 final shot comes up painfully short\n\nThe Rams had a shot to win the game on their final drive, but Zuerlein\u2019s missed 44-yard field goal with 15 seconds remaining sealed the Seattle victory.\n\nStory continues\n\nGreg the leg misses from 44 yards for the win! #LARvsSEA #seahawks pic.twitter.com/9DnoPB5suR \u2014 Sports Gifs & Videos (@Supreme_gifs) October 4, 2019\n\nIt was a stunning miss from one of the game\u2019s best kickers who has eight career game-winning field goals on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nZuerlein got his chance after the Seahawks failed to capitalize on a Jared Goff interception to Tedric Thompson with 2:12 left. Seattle went three-and-out on the ensuing possession and took just 30 seconds off the clock, setting Los Angeles up for what appeared to be the game-winning drive before Zuerlien\u2019s kick sailed wide right.\n\nWilson continues torrid start to 2019\n\nWilson finished the night completing 17-of-23 pass attempts for 268 yards and four touchdowns. He regularly made the types of plays he\u2019s become known for during his five-time Pro Bowl career, evading pressure with his feet and finding tight windows with his arm to come up with first downs and scores.\n\nHe also made plays on the ground, picking up 32 rushing yards on eight carries.\n\nWilson\u2019s big night was the latest in an outstanding start to the 2019 season that saw him enter Thursday averaging 285.3 passing yards with eight touchdowns and no interceptions through four games. He\u2019s still yet to throw a pick on the season.\n\nSeahawks are contenders\n\nWilson\u2019s excellence next to a running game anchored by Chris Carson and a rejuvenated defense rebuilt in the aftermath of the Legion of Boom has put the Seahawks back squarely in the Super Bowl contender conversation.\n\nCarson tallied 118 rushing yards on Thursday and now has 380 rushing yards on the season. Rookie burner DK Metcalf is proving to be a premium deep threat while Lockett and tight end Will Dissly are regular, reliable targets for Wilson.\n\nSeattle improves to 4-1 while sending its biggest division rival and the defending conference champions a game back at 3-2.\n\nWhat about the Rams?\n\nFor the Rams, all is not lost after almost pulling out a divisional road win. But questions remain about Sean McVay\u2019s once- unstoppable offense that clicked at times and sputtered at others as Goff did the same en route to 395 passing yards with a touchdown and an interception.\n\nTodd Gurley picked up a pair of touchdowns, but still doesn\u2019t look like the elite runner he was before last year\u2019s still-mysterious knee ailment that plagued him through the playoffs. He finished with 51 yards on 15 carries.\n\nThe Rams are still a strong football team. But for now they\u2019ve taken a clear backseat to the Seahawks in the division.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Behind brilliant play from Russell Wilson and a revamped defense, the Seahawks look like contenders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zpFfjNNJtsS397o4oREHWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g5g._kpymZkkyUJgsbx.ig--~B/aD0yNDg0O3c9MzcyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/58c92030-e657-11e9-bf7a-e3bc22dd49d1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
