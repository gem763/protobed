Microsoft employees have responded with a fiery statement condemning the partnership and calling on fellow employees to join them in walking out on September 20.\n\nWhen hundreds of Amazon workers announced last week that they would be walking out to protest their company\u2019s inadequate climate policies, Microsoft employees were quick to join their fellow Seattleites.\n\nOn September 10, a group called Microsoft Workers 4 Good tweeted \u201cMicrosoft workers will be joining millions of people around the world by participating in the youth-led Global Climate Strike on September 20th to demand an end to the age of fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nThe workers\u2019 demands are straightforward: \u201cZero carbon emissions by 2030. Zero contracts with fossil fuel companies. Zero funding of climate denial lobbying or other efforts. Zero harm to climate refugees and frontline communities.\u201d\n\nGoogle, Facebook and others pledged support for the multi-city walkout, some of which is being organised through the burgeoning Tech Workers Coalition. Then, on September 17, just three days before the well-publicised climate events, Microsoft announced that it had partnered with Chevron, the oil giant and Schlumberger, the world\u2019s largest oilfield services provider, to accelerate oil field development and extraction of fossil fuels.\n\nIt is, as Microsoft stated in its release yesterday, \u201cthe industry\u2019s first three-party collaboration to accelerate creation of innovative petrotechnical and digital technologies.\u201d\n\nThe partnership will \u201cdramatically accelerate the speed with which we can analyse data to generate new exploration opportunities and bring prospects to development more quickly and with more certainty,\u201d said Joseph C. Geagea, an executive vice president at Chevron, according to the Houston Chronicle.\n\nEssentially, Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform Azure will host Schlumberger\u2019s DELFI \u201ccognitive exploration and production environment,\u201d and the two companies will work with Chevron to build AI-powered applications native to both. If successful, the project\u2019s stakeholders have stated they hope to expand the technology and make it available to other oil companies, too.\n\nIt is, in other words, a project explicitly designed to improve the speed at which oil companies can develop new sites for fossil fuel extraction, as well as the rates of extraction at existing sites. The partnership aims to ensure more oil is extracted and burned, more efficiently. It would help increase carbon emissions, and it\u2019s a new contract with a fossil fuel company \u2014 a stark affront to the first two asks of the tech worker climate organisers.\n\n\u201cThis is a bad look,\u201d tweeted Calvin Jones, a senior product manager at Microsoft, when the news broke. Indeed, the announcement angered a number of employees. One Microsoft worker, who was granted anonymity, told me he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the announcement. \u201cTo me it really highlights where Microsoft\u2019s priorities are,\u201d he said. \u201cNeedless to say, it is money that drives the company and its actions. But this is starting to be at the expense of our planet.\u201d\n\nIt also outraged the employees who have been helping to organise the walkout, driving them to release a powerful, sometimes emotional statement urging more Microsoft workers to join them.\n\n\u201cWith this kind of news making headlines just three days before the Global Climate Strike,\u201d it reads, \u201cit\u2019s no longer possible for us to ignore Microsoft\u2019s complicity in the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nIt continues:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft makes millions of dollars in profits by helping fossil fuel companies extract more oil. In this week\u2019s company-wide all-hands, our CEO, Satya Nadella, defended our contracts with Big Oil by suggesting that our technology helps them in their R&D efforts to develop sustainable energy. Yet, this is in clear contradiction to the ambitions of fossil fuel-CEOs and even other Microsoft leaders: Azure Executive Tom Keane, in discussing Microsoft\u2019s multimillion dollar contract with Chevron, asked \u201cHow can we [..] more efficiently do oil exploration? Or more efficiently do sensor management from an offshore oil rig?\u201d \u201cAs Microsoft workers, we\u2019ve been made complicit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we want to make real impact, all of us need to mobilise, work together, and demand a fundamental change in Microsoft\u2019s priorities,\u201d it continues, \u201cIt is imperative that all tech companies stand together, denounce the usage of Cloud and AI services for non-renewable energy extraction, and work together to put an end to fossil fuel consumption.\u201d\n\nGizmodo obtained a copy of the statement, which was first sent to internal channels, then posted on GitHub, where it can now be read in full here.\n\nThis kind of partnership is not new to the company. Microsoft has been aggressively courting the oil industry, forming partnerships with ExxonMobil and hosting exhibitions like \u201cEmpowering Oil & Gas with AI\u201d at industry conferences. Yet the timing of this announcement seems particularly aggressive, given the well-publicised stake that Microsoft employees have in the climate strike.\n\nThree days before the Global #ClimateStrike, @Microsoft announced yet another partnership empowering Schlumberger and Chevron to extract more oil, faster. #LeaveItInTheGround https://t.co/jcoWZ5v2c0 \u2014 Microsoft Workers 4 Good (@MsWorkers4) September 18, 2019\n\nIt also remains remarkable that Microsoft\u2019s very public founder, Bill Gates, has made climate change a central focus of his philanthropy, and that he has made no public statement regarding the shift of the company he started towards embracing the oil industry. At this point, of the big five tech companies, Microsoft is perhaps doing the most to explicitly accelerate climate change.\n\n\u201cThis statement was necessary because we need to do more,\u201d one of its authors, also a Microsoft employee, told me. \u201cMicrosoft has so many resources and people power to make great change and emerge as a leader in sustainability. We need to stand with Amazon and Google as a united front and prove that together, we\u2019re an unstoppable force. The Global Climate Strike on September 20th is our chance to show just that. And this statement is calling on everyone, Microsoft employee or not, to come out and show their support.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Mere days before Microsoft workers are set to walk out of their jobs and publicly call on their employer to reduce carbon emissions and sever its ties with fossil fuel companies, the tech giant has announced a major partnership with two of the biggest corporations in the oil industry.
