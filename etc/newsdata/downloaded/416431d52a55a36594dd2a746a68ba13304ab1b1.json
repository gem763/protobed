Sebasti\u00e1n Marroqu\u00edn Son of Pablo Escobar\n\nThousands lost their lives during Pablo Escobar\u2019s reign at the top of the infamous Medell\u00edn cartel \u2013 a powerful drug trafficking ring which, during the height of its operations, brought in more than $60 million per day and supplied an estimated 80 percent of all cocaine smuggled into the US.\n\nBeginning his criminal career stealing cars and selling contraband cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, Escobar rose quickly through the ranks of the Colombian criminal underworld, often kidnapping and killing anyone who stood between him and his business interests.\n\nBy the early 90s, the so-called \u2018King of Cocaine\u2019 was the wealthiest criminal in history, turning over $21.9 billion a year in personal income, putting him among the richest men in the world.\n\nFollowing his death during a shootout with police in 1993, his family fled Colombia for Mozambique, eventually settling in Buenos Aires Argentina where Escobar\u2019s son, Juan Pablo, chose the name Sebasti\u00e1n Marroqu\u00edn and sought to distance himself from his father\u2019s and the Medellin Cartel\u2019s nefarious activities.\n\nAfter decades of remaining tight-lipped about his father, in the last few years he has written two books and featured in a documentary on the subject.\n\nEuronews met with Marroqu\u00edn to ask why, after so many years of silence, he has decided to reveal all about his relationship with his murderous father.\n\n\u201cThe worst violence imaginable,\u201d he responds when asked about what it was that made him turn away from the path his father carved for himself.\n\n\u201cEven Quentin Tarantino couldn\u2019t have imagined as much violence as there was.\u201d\n\nAfter decades of silence, Marroqu\u00edn says he feels he has a duty to tell the truth about Escobar. He tells Euronews that \u201cglorification\u201d is the \u201cbest ingredient\u201d to make money from his father\u2019s story, and that TV series and movies don\u2019t even scratch the surface of his cruelty.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that the image of Pablo Escobar has been used to tell stories about him that are not true,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAs his son, it\u2019s up to me to tell the truth about Escobar. It\u2019s not a truth that benefits me \u2013 quite the contrary \u2013 it\u2019s a truth that makes my father look even worse than how he is shown in the movies.\u201d\n\n\u2018Contradictions and paradoxes\u2019\n\nPablo Escobar \u2013 dubbed El Padrino by those who adored him \u2013 spent vast sums of money trying to ingratiate himself with the Colombian community.\n\nWith the billions of dollars he made trafficking tons of cocaine out of the country, he built homes, hospitals, schools and sports centers and, according to Marroqu\u00edn, these acts of generosity brought him \u201csympathy from the social classes who felt most abandoned [by the government]\u201d.\n\nBefore long, the press began to call him \u2018Robin Hood\u2019, and Marroqu\u00edn says that the image he cultivated \u201cguaranteed impunity and protection for many years\u201d.\n\nBut there were also contradictions to his father\u2019s kindness, Marroqu\u00edn says; a certain irony in his quest to do good.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cMy father\u2019s life is full of contrasts and paradoxes\u2026 He built sports fields so that young people didn\u2019t use drugs, but he financed them with drug money.\u201d\n\nIn spite all that his father had done, Marroqu\u00edn\u2019s first book was dedicated to El Padrino for showing him the path not to take in life.\n\n\u201cAs a son,\u201d he says, \u201cI have the best memories of him as a father and the worst of his violence.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I agree with those who have written about my father on is his unconditional love for his family.\u201d\n\nA difficult relationship\n\nEscobar\u2019s illicit activities were no secret.\n\nEveryone, including his family, knew of the thousands of murders Escobar ordered, the kidnapping and torture, and, of course, the drugs.\n\nAs a young teenager, Marroqu\u00edn did not keep his opinions from his father.\n\n\u201cI had him face to face and I told him a thousand times that I didn\u2019t like the bombs he planted, I didn\u2019t like that he kidnapped people, that he murdered people,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI knew that the violence he was generating would always turn against us.\u201d\n\nAnd this, according to Marroqu\u00edn, is what sets his books apart from the works of others on the subject of his father.\n\n\u201cThe imbalance between the truth behind this story and the fiction people want to sell about my father\u2019s life is evident,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI know that I would go from selling thousands of books to selling millions if I dedicated myself to writing an ode to my father.\u201d\n\nHowever, he says he can\u2019t stop people telling stories about Escobar, because he does the same thing.\n\nBut he feels the thing makes his stories different to the others is his refusal to glorify his father.\n\n\u201cI think the difference is summarized in a letter I received recently when I was presenting my second book in Argentina,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA 13-year-old boy gave me a closed envelope and told me that he had known who my father was since the age of eight.\n\n\u201cHe said: I know who your dad was because my grandmother told me about it and I was interested in the movies about him. I always wanted to be Pablo Escobar. Until I read your book. And now I want to be a journalist.\u201d\n\nIn the name of the father\n\nAfter fleeing Colombia following the death of his father, adjusting to normal life was difficult for Marroqu\u00edn.\n\nEscobar had gone down in a hail of gunfire when he was discovered hiding in a neighbourhood of Medell\u00edn following his escape from prison.\n\nWith authorities closing in, a firefight ensued and despite trying to make good his escape by fleeing across the rooftops, Escobar was felled by a fatal shot to the head.\n\nHowever, in spite of all he had done, he was given a hero\u2019s farewell, with 25,000 people lining the streets of Medell\u00edn on the day of his funeral.\n\nHis wife, son and young daughter fled the country, looking for asylum before settling, eventually, in Buenos Aires, where Marroqu\u00edn still lives today.\n\nHe now has a son of his own, which raises the difficult question of what to tell him about his infamous grandfather.\n\n\u201cObviously, I\u2019m not going to start telling him what prohibition or the drug trade is,\u201d says Marroqu\u00edn.\n\n\u201cBut he already knows that his grandfather is Pablo Escobar. My commitment to him is to raise him with respect and love, because I know that it would be exclusively what my father would give him if he were alive.\u201d\n\nBut as for keeping Escobar\u2019s transgressions from him, Marroqu\u00edn refuses to do so.\n\n\u201cOf course he will know 100 percent of the crimes committed by his grandfather so that the day he has the chance to be the next Pablo Escobar he has enough knowledge to choose a different path.\u201d\n\nWhat would he say to those who would idolize his father?\n\n\u201cI would invite them to become aware of the true story of Pablo Escobar,\u201d he responds. \u201cIt\u2019s not that glorified, glamorous version you see in the TV series about him.\u201d\n\nAccording to Marroqu\u00edn, the money and the luxury that came with his father\u2019s profession were only a tiny fraction of a much larger picture.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point in owning a mansion if you do not have anyone at home waiting for you?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhen I was hiding with my father, we were surrounded by millions of dollars but we were starving. Money is supposed to take away your hunger. To us money brought hunger, death, violence, and the disappearance of loved ones.\u201d\n\nIn his words, he would not recommend that anyone gets caught up in his father\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d he says, \u201cI do not know of any retired drug traffickers.\u201d", "description": "Thousands lost their lives on Escobar's route to the top of the Colombian criminal underworld.
