When Alma wakes up in the hospital following her car crash in the Undone series premiere, she\u2019s greeted by her immediate family. There\u2019s her mother, Camila, lecturing Alma for not wearing a seatbelt before she says a word about being happy Alma is alive. There\u2019s her sister, Becca, bubbly and somehow endearingly self-centered as she talks about Alma zipping through physical therapy in time to be maid of honor at her wedding.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s her father, Jacob, sitting in the corner, quietly reading a newspaper. He\u2019s dead.\n\nIf the Undone premiere was a chance for us to learn about Alma\u2019s dissatisfying life, \u201cThe Hospital\u201d is our chance to see what happens when it all blows up. The result is an absolute dazzler of an episode that embraces the full potential of Undone\u2019s rotoscope animation while deepening the mystery of what happened to Alma\u2019s father \u2014 and why now, at such a strange crossroads in her own life, she can suddenly see him.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Jacob, Alma\u2019s father. An early flashback gives us a window into the kind of father he was: loving, doting, and quick to defuse a potential conflict with an improvised joke. As Jacob makes socks out of newspapers and takes Alma for a second round of trick-or-treating, you can see the vital role he played in balancing out the dynamics of this family, and the hole it left when he was suddenly gone.\n\nThen again: He\u2019s also the guy who left his adolescent daughter waiting on the sidewalk when he dashed off to solve some unexplained problem. And now he\u2019s the guy who deliberately engineered a car accident so his daughter could help him by going back in time and reversing the mysterious incident that led to his death in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe Hospital\u201d is a kind of orientation: For the viewer, who might need time to get used to Undone\u2019s rapid-fire visual and geographical leaps this show will take, and for Alma, who is understandably overwhelmed by her new superpower. For much of the episode, Alma is caught in a time loop, returning again and again to the moment she wakes up in the hospital bed.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just a Russian Doll situation. Alma is still learning the boundaries of her superpowers, but they seem to puncture reality itself. In one loop, her bed appears in a real-life version of the forest that appears on the front of a greeting card she gets from Sam. In another particularly horrifying loop, centuries seem to pass in an instant, as her mother grows old, turns into a skeleton, and melts. In another, more panicked loop, Alma sprints through the hospital, discovering indecipherable buttons in the elevator and briefly blipping into the reality show playing on the TV in her hospital room. And in yet another loop, Alma sees herself in that same elevator.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to process, which is why Jacob is quick to warn Alma that she needs to control her mind. \u201cYou\u2019re letting the whole ocean in at once,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you do that, you will go mad.\u201d He also alludes to Alma\u2019s late grandmother, Geraldine, who was treated as a schizophrenic but, according to Jacob, went through something very much like this.\n\nAnd while we have plenty of reason to distrust Jacob\u2019s role in Alma\u2019s current predicament \u2014 at the very least, his interest in using Alma\u2019s superpower is utterly selfish \u2014 he does make a fairly compelling pitch. As a child, when Alma dressed up as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, Jacob wondered aloud why anyone would enter a world as magical as Oz and spend all her time trying to get back to her boring home.\n\nNow \u2014 opposite a breathtaking montage that includes flowers blooming in space, fish turning into birds, and young and old Alma dancing together under the moon \u2014 Jacob argues that Alma, like Dorothy, has to make a similar choice: \u201cTry something different. A life that doesn\u2019t follow a paint-by-numbers timeline. Or any timeline at all. A life where anything can happen at any time. A life without limitations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this speech about a life without limitations ends with a very specific image: Jacob, returning to the young Alma on the sidewalk where he left her behind, and sweeping her up in his arms. In a world of infinite possibilities, this long-delayed family reunion might be Alma\u2019s greatest dream of all.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 Even with the extremely limited information we\u2019ve been given, let\u2019s speculate: What, exactly, was Jacob doing on the night of his death? While trick-or-treating with Alma, he gets a brief phone call, and urges the frantic caller not to dial 911 before he takes off to fix \u2026 well, whatever he\u2019s fixing.\n\n\u2022 After a series of loops, Alma does seem to grow a little bit. Instead of snarking back at her mom for the seatbelt lecture, she apologizes for not always recognizing that other people care about her, and she patiently indulges Becca\u2019s self-centered monologue about the wedding,\n\n\u2022 Apparently independent of her new superpower, Alma has some memory loss from the car accident, which means she doesn\u2019t remember breaking up with Sam. As a result, he just pretends they\u2019re still together. Honestly, dude: Pretty weird!\n\n\u2022 Young Alma wonders how the Wicked Witch of the West manages to pee without melting, and honestly: great question.\n\n\u2022 Alma watches (and then takes a brief trip into) The Cake Off, an apparent knockoff of The Great British Bake Off that Amazon is probably green-lighting right this second.\n\n\u2022 What is a Hospital Cactus Garden? Exactly what it sounds like.", "description": "An absolute dazzler of an episode embraces the full potential of rotoscope animation while deepening the series\u2019 central mystery.
