I find it hard to believe that your office was unable to identify lodgings that could accommodate the security and logistical needs of your trip in the capital of Ireland, which houses among other locations the United States Embassy \u2013 where President Reagan stayed during his 1984 visit,\u201d Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, wrote in a letter to Pence Thursday.\n\nTrump and a number of administration officials have repeatedly stayed at Trump-owned properties during his presidency, raising concerns about whether the president has profited from his presidency. Legal observers have also questioned whether he has violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from profiting from foreign or domestic government bodies.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Speaking to reporters in Dublin, where Vice President Mike Pence spent the day, he spoke about his personal connection to the village of Doonbeg \u2014 the site of both the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel as well as family history.\n\nIn response to inquiries earlier this week, Pence\u2019s office initially claimed that he stayed at Trump\u2019s golf club at the \u201csuggestion\u201d of the president. Pence also described it as a \u201cfamily\u201d visit because his cousin runs a bar in Doonbeg, and his great-grandmother grew up there.\n\n\u201cI am alarmed that you elected to spend taxpayer dollars for travel and lodging at President Trump\u2019s privately-owned property \u2013 located on the other side of the country, more than 180 miles away from your meetings with government officials in Dublin,\u201d Peters wrote Thursday. \u201cThis raises serious concerns about wasteful expenditures and possible conflicts of interest related to taxpayer-funded travel by this Administration.\u201d\n\nPeters also attached a series of questions to Pence about the trip, including how much it cost taxpayers and the government, whether he was charged the regular rate or \u201ca government rate,\u201d and \u201cwhether any analysis was conducted to compare the full costs of travel \u2014 including lodging, security, and other travel costs \u2013 for staying in Doonbeg instead of Dublin during your official visit to Ireland.\u201d\n\nAccording to government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), at least 250 Trump administration officials have made at least 630 visits to Trump-owned properties, most frequently his senior advisers, daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nPence\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Peters\u2019 letter, which was first obtained by ABC News.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he had \u201cno involvement\u201d in Pence\u2019s decision to stay at his golf club.\n\n\u201cFrom what I understood, he was going there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThen I heard he was going there, but I didn\u2019t \u2015 it wasn\u2019t my idea for Mike to go there. Mike went there because his family is there. That\u2019s my \u2015 that\u2019s my understanding of it.\u201d\n\nRead the full letter below.", "description": "A number of White House officials and staff have stayed at Trump-owned properties, raising concerns about whether Trump has profited from the presidency.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7139c2240000d11775f98a.jpeg?cache=jdajfdc2se&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
