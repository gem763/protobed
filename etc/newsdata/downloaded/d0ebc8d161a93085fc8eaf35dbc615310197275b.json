While Houston is the hub of the U.S. energy industry, big tech companies are settling in Austin (Google and Apple) and Dallas (Uber).\n\nAnd with a large, young, and college-educated workforce flocking to live and work in the region, these Texas cities and suburbs have been both gaining political power and becoming more solidly liberal. Research by Ren\u00e9e Cross and Richard Murray at the University of Houston has found that voters in the 27 counties around big metro areas grew from 52% of the total electorate in 1968 to 69% in 2018. Meanwhile, voters in the more rural counties \u2013 outside the Democratic strongholds in south Texas \u2013 decreased from 38% to 8% in that time.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke in particular was effective in ginning up support and \u2013 crucially, for a low-turnout demographic \u2013 votes from young Texans. He carried the state\u2019s five major urban counties by a combined 790,000 votes last year, six times more than Mr. Obama in 2012. Registering and turning out more voters in those cities and suburbs is at the core of Texas Democrats\u2019 plan, released this week, to flip \u201cthe biggest battleground state in the country.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Csmonitor.Com Usa Politics Texodus-Why-The-Lone-Star-State-Might-Turn-Blue-For-Real-This-Time"], "top_image": ""}
