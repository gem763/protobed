(Photo: Viking)\n\nMidway through John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s 25th novel, \"Agent Running in the Field (Viking, 288 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four stars), the main character Nat, a Cold War veteran of the British Secret Intelligence Service, recalls what his espionage mentor once told him: \u201cIf you spy for long enough, the show comes round again.\u201d\n\nAnd so it does for Nat and for the multitude of le Carr\u00e9 fans who know that this spy-novel master loves to double down on plots starring expendable, aging spies in the twilight of their careers who are pulled back into Deep State operations.\n\nThe story begins at the Athleticus badminton club in South West London, where Nat, 47, is the reigning champion. When a young, awkward stranger named Ed challenges him to a badminton throw down, the story\u2019s vibe turns to suspicion. Despite Nat\u2019s wariness of Ed, who over post-match pints talks obsessively of his hatred for Brexit and Trump, they hit it off and play matches most Mondays.\n\nMore: Steph Cha smartly interrogates LA racial tensions in page-turner 'Your House Will Pay'\n\nBadminton\u2019s not exactly babe-seducing, fast-car chasing James Bond, is it? While this novel has high-wire moments, le Carr\u00e9 doesn\u2019t do \"Goldfinger.\" Rather, Nat\u2019s first-person narrative heats up more like Earl Grey steeping \u2013 to be savored, not stirred.\n\nIt\u2019s 2018, and M16 has called Nat back to London from his agent-running decades in Moscow and Eastern Europe. He frets that he\u2019s being put out to pasture. Instead, he is assigned to run Haven, a derelict London spy substation.\n\nThe story unfolds leisurely, as Nat adapts to his new desk job and settles into home life with his smart lawyer wife, Prue, and rebellious college-age daughter, Steff. Badminton included, it all makes the duplicity and betrayal harder to see coming.\n\nLe Carr\u00e9 gradually builds his cast of engaging, sub rosa characters. Angst-driven Ed is a key player. So is Nat\u2019s second at Haven, Florence, a young, classy, potty-mouthed rising star. Nat\u2019s boss, Dom, is incompetent, compromised. Russian sleeper-agent-turned-double-agent Sergei is troublesome. Minor characters, like retired Russian spy Arkady, are defined by treachery and critical to the plot.\n\nAuthor John le Carr\u00e9. (Photo: Nadav Kandar)\n\nOnce a British spy himself, le Carr\u00e9, 88, has been writing best-selling espionage fiction for more than 50 years. He knows intricately the clandestine world\u2019s tradecraft. He knows that spies \u2013 even the clever, amusing Nat \u2013 live nearly broken double lives troubled with daily doubt, distrust and deception. Yet, living a shadowy life defined by danger, heartlessness and immorality, Nat has survived as a decent, good-hearted man.\n\n\"Agent Running in the Field\" is a throwback to le Carr\u00e9 \u2019s first two novels starring another retired spy, George Smiley, the author\u2019s most famous recurring character. Though unlike those Cold War settings, this novel's crises and controversies are clear and present.\n\nWhile \"Agent Running in the Field\" isn\u2019t a breathtaking thriller, it is a breathing and alive contemporary tale. Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s storytelling genius frequently causes pause to consider what a pleasure it is to read him, right up to the novel\u2019s thought-provoking, albeit anticlimactic ending.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/22/agent-running-field-modern-thriller-master-john-le-carre/4010234002/", "description": "An aging veteran of British\u00a0Secret Intelligence Service is called back to London in this slow-moving but delectable spy thriller from John le Carr\u00e9.", "authors": ["Don Oldenburg", "Special To Usa Today", "J.K.
