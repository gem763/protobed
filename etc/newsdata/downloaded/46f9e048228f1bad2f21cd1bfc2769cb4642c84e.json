Hollywood liberals backtrack after seeking list of Trump donors", "language": "en", "text": "The politics of blacklisting is again rearing its ugly head.\n\nAnd what\u2019s driving it is a conviction by some on the left that Donald Trump is so dangerous that his donors need to be spotlighted and exposed.\n\nExcept that this time there\u2019s a backlash to the blacklisting. And even liberals are denouncing the move as a horrible, terrible, no-good, really bad idea.\n\nDEMOCRATIC FIELD SUPPOSEDLY NARROWS AS TRUMP RUNS AGAINST THE MEDIA\n\nThe latest contretemps was started by Hollywood types, so it has a nice celebrity status to lift it above the usual Twitter talk.\n\nWith Trump scheduled to hold a fundraiser in Beverly Hills, Eric McCormack, a star of \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d urged the Hollywood Reporter to reveal whoever has the temerity to show up and support the president\u2019s campaign.\n\n\"Hey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event,\" he wrote, \"so the rest of us can be clear about who we don't want to work with. Thx,\" McCormack tweeted.\n\nHis co-star, Debra Messing, who despises Trump, soon echoed the call: \u201cPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know.\u201d\n\nThe president, who has tangled with Messing before, quickly hit back:\n\n\u201cI have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC\u2019s failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me \u2018Sir.\u2019 How times have changed!\u201d\n\nA word about campaign donors: Of course their contributions are public record. But it takes some work to dig up the list of contributors at a particular event or in a certain geographic area\u2014and in this hyperpartisan environment, that\u2019s not done for fun.\n\nBut this tale has a twist. Some liberals say the actors went too far.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nOn \u201cThe View,\u201d Whoopi Goldberg, who\u2019s no Trump fan, delivered a stern condemnation:\n\n\u201cThis is not a good idea, okay? Your idea of who you don\u2019t want to work with is your personal business. Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on, and then people will be coming after you!\u201d\n\nWhoopi went on to invoke the Hollywood blacklists of the McCarthy era, when plenty of people in the entertainment industry lost their jobs because a mere whisper of communist affiliation. \u201cNobody cared whether it was true or not,\u201d she said.\n\nLo and behold, McCormack suddenly started backpedaling.\n\nHe said on Instagram that his earlier tweet \u201chas been misinterpreted in a very upsetting way. I absolutely do not support blacklists or discrimination of any kind, as anyone who knows me would attest. I'd simply like to understand where Trump's major donations are coming from, which is a matter of public record.\u201d\n\nThis is pure Hollywood fiction. What did McCormack think would happen to those donors whose names would be made public? His original tweet said he wants to know who\u2019s giving Trump cash so he and others \u201ccan be clear about who we don't want to work with.\u201d If that isn\u2019t a boycott, what is?\n\nFace it, he\u2019s rewriting the script in a way that no producer would accept.\n\nMessing, also feeling the heat, joined the retreat: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better.\u201d\n\nThe same issue surfaced last month when Rep. Joaquin Castro, chairman of his brother\u2019s presidential campaign, published a list of Trump donors in his Texas district and their business affiliations.\n\nThe congressman, in the wake of the El Paso shootings, said those who financially support Trump are \u201cfueling a campaign of hate.\u201d But Castro faced a substantial backlash.\n\nHouse GOP Whip Steve Scalise, who was badly wounded at a baseball practice by a gunman who hated Republicans, said: \u201cPeople should not be personally targeted for their political views, period.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a sliding scale here: Refusing to serve people in restaurants. Shouting at them in public places. Organizing protests outside their homes. Publicizing lists of donors. Saying they are fueling \u201chate.\u201d It\u2019s all aimed at harassing those who participate in democracy, and too many Trump haters seem to justify it when the president, his aides and supporters are the targets.\n\nBut the strong criticism of Debra Messing and her Hollywood pals, even by liberals on \u201cThe View,\u201d suggests a growing realization that some of these tactics go too far.", "description": "The politics of blacklisting is again rearing its ugly head.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/04/694940094001_6083496522001_6083500113001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
