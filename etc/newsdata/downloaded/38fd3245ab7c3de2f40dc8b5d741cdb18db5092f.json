However, only 14 studies \u2013 all based on human disease \u2013 reported good quality data, tested the deep learning system with images from a separate dataset to the one used to train it, and showed the same images to human experts.\n\nThe team pooled the most promising results from within each of the 14 studies to reveal that deep learning systems correctly detected a disease state 87% of the time \u2013 compared with 86% for healthcare professionals \u2013 and correctly gave the all-clear 93% of the time, compared with 91% for human experts.\n\nHowever, the healthcare professionals in these scenarios were not given additional patient information they would have in the real world which could steer their diagnosis.", "description": "", "authors": ["Theguardian.Com Technology Sep Ai-Equal-With-Human-Experts-In-Medical-Diagnosis-Study-Finds"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
