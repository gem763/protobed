To add to their discomfort, Iraq, where there are more than 5000 American soldiers helping to combat ISIS, told Washington this new contingent was not welcome and had no permission to remain.\n\nThere seems no end to the mis-steps by the US and the west since the 2003 invasion of Iraq that upended a precarious but centuries-old regional balance. Russia, which along with Iran saved Bashar al-Assad\u2019s dictatorship in Syria from succumbing to a majority Sunni rebellion, is the winner. Turkey, the main external backer of the rebellion against the Assads, is at best in the middle.\n\nIt was Moscow that found a sort of solution for the Syrian Kurds betrayed by the US. It brokered a deal between the Assad regime and the YPG that controlled one-quarter of Syria. Russia has helped Mr Assad\u2019s forces to advance into north-western areas adjoining two enclaves Turkey already controls \u2014 as a result of incursions in 2016 and 2018 greenlighted by Russia.\n\nThese include Manbij, where Russian video of a hastily abandoned US base went viral, and Kobani, the border city whose epic defence against Isis by the YPG, with US air cover, in 2014-15 gave the Syrian Kurds their evanescent moment in the western sun.\n\nSo yes, Mr Trump\u2019s pullout from north-east Syria has, for now, given Mr Erdogan what he wanted: an extension of Turkey\u2019s frontiers southwards into a Syrian buffer zone. But that has left him more vulnerable to Mr Putin, who is working hard to divide NATO member Turkey from its western allies. This would seem to be working.\n\nMr Erdogan has the rare ability to unite the US Congress in bipartisan hostility against him, whatever goes on in his phone calls with Mr Trump. If Ankara resumes its assault on Syria\u2019s Kurds, Congress will tighten sanctions screws on Turkey, and a White House under siege will probably fall in line.\n\nTurkey\u2019s vulnerability to Russia results from its tattered Syria policy, which is at the heart of its grievances with the US. This is a toxic cocktail.\n\nNow, as the Russian-backed Assad forces surge back into northern Syria after a gap of more than seven years, the absence of the US is not exactly a plus for Turkey. It is an undoubted plus for Mr Putin, by contrast, to have his military police patrolling a NATO border.\n\nMr Assad, on a visit to the front lines of Idlib, the last rebel redoubt in north-west Syria, called Mr Erdogan \u201ca thief\u201d. The Turkish president, for his part, has long referred to Mr Assad as \u201ca butcher\u201d. Mr Putin has his work cut out here if he wants the two leaders \u2014 their armies marching towards each other \u2014 to somehow be reconciled.\n\nHe would know, however, that, with the partial exception of the Iranians, every leader in the Middle East can turn on a sixpence. And after Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d debacle, he seems confident Arab leaders will once again take Russia seriously.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "There seems no end to the mis-steps by the US and the west since the 2003 invasion of Iraq that upended a precarious but centuries-old regional balance.
