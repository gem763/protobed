Ms Miller and her team, and the government.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Supreme Court: What happened on Tuesday?\n\nWhat happened on Wednesday?\n\nWednesday focused on the two sides that had won their arguments in the lower courts.\n\nIn the morning, the government's representative, Sir James Eadie QC, argued in favour of the English court decision.\n\nHe said prorogation was \"a well-established constitutional function exercised by the executive\" and decisions about it were \"squarely\u2026 within that political or high policy area\".\n\nSir James also argued Parliament had previously passed laws addressing aspects of prorogation, but there was no law relevant to this particular case - meaning the courts could not intervene.\n\nAsked about the need to uphold parliamentary sovereignty, Sir James said it was \"a precious principle\", but urged caution before \"that phrase is too widely or generally bandied about\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The government's lawyer, Sir James Eadie QC, says the suspension is a political judgement\n\nOne of the judges, Lady Black, asked how could Parliament apply a check on government once it is \"removed from the picture\" due to prorogation.\n\nBut Sir James said it always and inevitably had the effect of limiting debate in Parliament, and MPs could resume their scrutiny once the suspension was over.\n\nIt was not appropriate for the courts to \"design a set of rules\" about how long a suspension should last, he said.\n\nThe BBC's home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani, said a key issue was the scope of parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nLord Wilson also asked Sir James why no witness statement had been provided by a minister to explain why the prorogation decision was taken.\n\nSir James told the court he would present a written statement setting out what the government would do if it lost the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Advocate General for Scotland, Lord Keen QC, on behalf of the government, assured the court the prime minister would take \"all necessary steps\" to comply in that event, but would not comment on whether Mr Johnson might subsequently try to prorogue Parliament again.\n\nThe afternoon session saw Aidan O'Neill QC arguing in favour of the Scottish court ruling against prorogation.\n\nHe said the decision had been carried out \"in bad faith\", and \"for an improper purpose\".\n\nHe suggested the government should engage \"solely in high politics rather than low, dishonest, dirty tricks\", but \"given the attitude that has been taken by its advisers and the prime minister to the notion of the rule of law\" that could not be assumed.\n\nMr O'Neill said one of the advantages of the ruling from Edinburgh was it had \"distance\", adding: \"A view of what all of this heated debate [and] political machinations looks like 400 miles away, far from the fever and excitement of the nation's capital, [and] outside the Westminster bubble.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aidan O'Neill QC argued to uphold the ruling of the Scottish courts\n\nHe said he was not calling for the court to \"decide a whole new set of rules for how prorogation can be used\", but argued it was \"most certainly for the province of the courts\" to determine whether the move followed constitutional principles.\n\nHe added: \"In the present case, it appears the prime minister's action\u2026 has had the intent and effect of preventing Parliament... from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions that will have constitutional and irreversible impact on our country.\n\n\"That cannot be a lawful use of the power of prorogation.\"\n\nHe added: \"We cannot have a situation in which there are no standards, in which prorogation can be used with impunity.\"\n\nIt is not yet known when the judges will deliver their verdict - it could be as early as Thursday afternoon.\n\nOur home affairs correspondent said the feeling was the wait would not be long given the importance of the issue.", "description": "Judges at the Supreme Court continued to hear arguments over the legality of suspending Parliament.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6775/production/_108858462_944e56ab-b34f-43df-8186-3583721d5cbd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
