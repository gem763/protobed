The answer came in response to a question posed by Congressman David Kustoff (R-Tenn), who cut through Zuckerberg\u2019s typical explanation about the project being largely charitable.\n\n\u201cWhen you came up with this idea and went to your board of directors, how did you tell them that Facebook could monetize or profit from the creation or use of Libra and Calibra?\u201d the congressman asked.\n\n\u201cWell, Congressman, you may not believe this, but that\u2019s actually not the first thing that we talk about at the company,\u201d Zuckerberg responded. \u201cWe focus on building services that are going to create value in people\u2019s lives, and we believe that if we do that, that we\u2019re eventually able to get some of the value downstream.\u201d\n\nIf more of these purchases happen on Facebook than say, Amazon or Google, the social network will be able to snap up a larger portion of the ad market. Zuckerberg explained:\n\nThe way that this will help Facebook over time is that basically in our ads system, it\u2019s an auction. If you\u2019re a small business, we don\u2019t have a rate that you have to pay \u2014 you bid and tell us what the ads are worth to you if you can get customers into your store or if you can complete a transaction. And what we basically see is when we eliminate friction for a customer buying something from a business, then the value for that business of advertising on our system goes up, so they bid more in the ad system. If we can make that now, in addition to finding businesses that people want to interact with, people can also transact with them directly. I would expect that over time that will lead to higher prices for ads because it will be worth more to businesses so they will bid more on the ads system.\n\nZuckerberg hasn\u2019t said anything about whether Libra will have transaction fees \u2014 a key part of why people like decentralized cryptocurrencies (which don\u2019t have them) and a key question for his project (which isn\u2019t decentralized, and thus could).\n\nA less charitable read on Zuck\u2019s response could also be that if converting Libras into dollars is difficult, people will be forced to spend money \u2014 and advertise their goods\u2014 on Facebook since it\u2019ll be too hard to do so anywhere else.\n\nThis is all predicated on Libra actually getting off the ground. So far, Facebook\u2019s planned cryptocurrency, which launched in 2019, has been plagued with regulatory concerns from international lawmakers, wary financial partners in the US, and looming competition from China.\n\n\u201cBut in order for that to happen, we have to build a system that passes all the regulatory approvals, it has to be useful for people, if all that plays out then we may see a positive business impact,\u201d Zuckerberg finished.\n\nSure, sure.", "description": "During a congressional testimony, the tech CEO tried to quell lawmakers\u2019 concerns about Libra.
