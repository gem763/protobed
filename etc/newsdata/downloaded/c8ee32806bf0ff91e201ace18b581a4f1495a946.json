Morales is currently vying to serve an unprecedented fourth term as president under the Movement for Socialism Party.\n\nThe previous figure \u2013 issued before the pause on Sunday with some 84 percent of the votes counted \u2013 suggested Morales was unlikely to secure the needed margin for victory, sparking allegations of fraud from the Citizen Community Party leader Mesa and his supporters, some of whom took to the streets to protest ahead of the final count.\n\nIn videos posted online, opposition demonstrators could be seen setting fire to a TSE headquarters in Bolivia\u2019s capital of Sucre, while similar angry crowds were spotted burning election materials in the southern city of Tarija.\n\nBolivian opposition supporters burn headquarters of the electoral authority in Sucre, Chuquisaca as votes continue to be counted, and as Carlos Mesa conspires, claiming fraud. pic.twitter.com/JefBxGZ4rd \u2014 Camila (@camilateleSUR) October 22, 2019\n\nSerious attack by supporters of Bolivia's opposition in Tarija as we await official results from the TSE.
