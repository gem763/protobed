Many came with handmade cardboard signs.\n\nSome students came with handmade cardboard signs. The one in the middle reads, \"Hongkongers, resist\".

But though we only have so little freedom left, we will continue to resist and show defiance to the authorities,\u201d said Martin Lee, a 15-year-old student, who is a member of the school\u2019s anti-ELAB concern group.\n\nLee was responding to the Education Bureau\u2019s statement released last Friday that said students should not wear masks or cover their faces by any means in and out of school, except for health or religious reasons.\n\nAlthough Lee\u2019s parents opposed his involvement in the movement, he said he had to persist in doing the right thing. At home, he avoids talking about politics with his parents, as they always end up in arguments.\n\nA guide to the key players in the Hong Kong protests\n\nLee\u2019s mother also signed the reply slip distributed by the Education Bureau on her phone. He said that he couldn\u2019t do anything about it, as the reply slips were sent directly to parents online.\n\n\u201cYet, I can\u2019t stay silent in this critical moment because of my parents. There\u2019s no turning back already. If the central government continues to erode our freedoms, we won\u2019t be able to speak our minds anymore,\u201d said Lee. \u201cHong Kong can never go back to the prosperous city that we know.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, he held up a black Bauhinia flag. The crowd chanted in the background, \u201cHongkongers, resist!\u201d\n\nAnother student, Yin Tang, said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t resist the emergency law, the government will use it to take away our freedoms step by step.\u201d\n\nAs the students sing the movement's anthem, \"Glory to Hong Kong\", some put their hands on their hearts.

The 16-year-old claimed he was only playing video games with a friend and did not take part in any illegal activities. He started running when he saw at least 100 riot police officers arriving at the scene.\n\nKwong\u2019s hands were tied behind his back with a zip tie for more than 20 minutes and police officers searched his bag.\n\n\u201cThe officers said a lot of insulting things to us. They asked us why we didn\u2019t spend our energy on studying and broke the law instead. Some even said it would be best if all of us had a criminal record,\u201d Kwong said.\n\nKwong, 16, was arrested for vandalism, theft and unlawful assembly near Sha Tin City Hall on Saturday night.

He eventually met with his lawyer at around 2am and was released on bail at 3am.\n\nKwong said he will not attend school today and that the school has arranged emotional support services for him and other arrested students once they are ready to return to school.\n\nStudents who participated in the human chain event did not wear masks. Tam Siu-ching, 16, said it is because most students feared they would be violating the newly imposed anti-mask law if they hid their faces.\n\n\u201cWe are here to support our schoolmates, but because there are many of us, I think it is better to not wear a mask,\u201d Tang said.\n\nThe human chain event ended at around 8am, and students were ushered into school by their teachers. The school\u2019s concern group will organise another activity during lunch time today in which students will make paper cranes, a symbol of hope, to show support for the arrested students.\n\nA police vehicle arrived at Sha Tin Wai Station at around 8:00am, shortly after the human chain event began, but police officers remained in the vehicle.", "description": "Students at Shau Kei Wan Government Secondary School and Christ College in Sha Tin held peaceful demonstrations supporting the students arrested and opposing the mask ban", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shatinhumanchain.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
