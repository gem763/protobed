Their desire to work elsewhere has caused great consternation among some fans and media members, who fret that these players are upsetting the natural order.\n\nDetractors insist that the universe isn\u2019t supposed to work like that.\n\nOnly management gets to decide if and when a player is shipped out.\n\nYou say he loves being part of that franchise? Sorry. He and his family are entrenched in the community? Tough. He\u2019s being sent to a horrible situation with a terrible organization? Oh well.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the job and comes with the territory.\n\nThe same imbalance of power surfaces in the private sector from time to time. When a company decides to relocate its headquarters, some lucky workers get to choose between keeping their job or staying put. I imagine former employees of the Baltimore Colts weren\u2019t required to steal away in the middle of the night, but they likely can offer moving advice to current employees of the Oakland Raiders.\n\nThe general public has a lot more empathy for transplanted office workers than, say, wideout Demaryius Thomas, who earlier this month was traded from New England to the New York Jets. Thomas didn\u2019t request, demand or suggest a move.\n\nNonetheless, he went from a favorite for the Super Bowl to a contender for the toilet bowl.\n\nI know, I know. Pro athletes make a whole lot more money than average Joes and Janes, enjoying an income level that disallows any dissatisfaction over working conditions. If players on the Miami Dolphins have an issue with management\u2019s blatant tanking, they must shut up and bear it, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to earn NFL paychecks.\n\nThis might be a radical concept, but money doesn\u2019t buy happiness.\n\nMiami appears to be an exceedingly gloomy workplace, and no right-minded person should fault a player like defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick, who sought and was granted a trade. He joins offensive lineman Laremy Tunsil and wideout Kenny Stills on the list of talented young players Miami unloaded in recent months.\n\nWhether or not they asked to be traded, they must feel like they received pardons. But circumstances don\u2019t have to be as dire as Miami\u2019s for a player to seek a change, for whatever reason.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey requested a trade last week. (I refuse to portray them as demands; teams have 99.9 % of the power and therefore do whatever the heck they choose.) Ramsey played in Week 3 but missed practice on Monday after calling in sick.\n\nHis claim has generated skepticism from many, presumably from some who ever called in sick for reasons unrelated to health. \u201cJalen Ramsey is everything that\u2019s wrong with NFL,\u201d read a recent newspaper headline, topping a column that decried Ramsey\u2019s \u201cselfish trade demands.\u201d\n\nOf course, columnists don\u2019t selfishly request trades. They simply accept job offers elsewhere, leaving their old \u201cteam\u201d to fend for itself. Employees who aren\u2019t bound by noncompete clauses customarily do likewise.\n\nCritics believe athletes shouldn\u2019t have a say in decisions that other workers make routinely, like where to work. The paradigm starts with the draft, which is built on an illogical fear that the best athletes would flock to certain teams and forsake others. Supposedly, big markets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago would horde all the talent, leaving crumbs for outposts like Green Bay, Buffalo and Jacksonville.\n\nBut think a little deeper about life without a draft.\n\nHow many top college quarterbacks over the last 15 years would\u2019ve chosen to start their career in New England? How many stellar left tackles or middle linebackers could be stockpiled by Chicago? Players would be drawn to teams based on a number of factors: the opportunity for playing time, proximity to hometown, childhood association, friends on the rosters, etc.\n\nGiving players freedom of choice from the outset wouldn\u2019t be nearly as messy as feared. Alas, that\u2019s another subject for another day.\n\nFor now, I\u2019m simply questioning the outcry as a handful of players try to be active participants in charting their career paths. I\u2019m wondering why so many folks adamantly oppose players making trade requests, yet accept teams trading (or cutting) players who want to remain.\n\nYes, selfishness is involved. But it emanates from the fans way more than the athletes.\n\n\u2981 Brooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
