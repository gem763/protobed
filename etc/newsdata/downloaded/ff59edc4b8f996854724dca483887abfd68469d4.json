Gavin Newsom said. \u201cNo one is satisfied with this, no one is happy with this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe utility needs to upgrade and fix its equipment so massive outages aren\u2019t the norm going forward, he said.\n\nIt could take as many as five days to restore power after the danger has passed because every inch of power line must be checked to make sure it isn\u2019t damaged or in danger of sparking a blaze, PG&E said.\n\nThe news came as residents in the region\u2019s wine country north of San Francisco marked the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes. San Francisco is the only county in the nine-county Bay Area where power will not be affected.\n\nTo the south, Southern California Edison said more than 106,000 of its customers in parts of eight counties could face power cuts as early as Thursday as Santa Ana winds loomed.\n\nThe cutbacks followed a game plan instituted after deadly wildfires \u2014 some blamed on downed PG&E transmission lines \u2014 destroyed dozens of lives and thousands of homes in recent years and forced the utility into bankruptcy over an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits.\n\nPG&E planned to shut down power to about 500,000 customers between midnight and 4 a.m. Wednesday, starting northward and following the winds south, expanding the outage as weather required it.\n\nBut the outages weren\u2019t limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimize the risk of wildfires.\n\nClasses were cancelled for thousands of schoolchildren and at the University of California, Berkeley, Sonoma State University and Mills College.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation said it was installing generators to avoid closing the Caldecott Tunnel linking the East Bay to San Francisco and the Tom Lantos Tunnel on State Route 1 in Pacifica.\n\n\u201cThe tunnels can\u2019t operate without power,\u201d Caltrans tweeted.\n\nPG&E had warned of the possibility of a widespread shut-off Monday, prompting residents to flock to stores for supplies as they prepared for dying cellphone batteries, automatic garage doors that won\u2019t work and lukewarm refrigerators.\n\n\u201cWe sold out of lanterns this morning. The shelf is completely empty,\u201d said Howard Gibbs, the manager at Ace Hardware in the town of Lafayette, 20 miles east of San Francisco. \u201cWe\u2019ve got just a few flashlights left, and we\u2019re down to our last couple propane tanks, too.\u201d\n\nResidents of the Sonoma County city of Cloverdale, population 9,300, were preparing for the possibility of zero power and downed internet and cellphone lines, as happened during the wine country fires. Cloverdale homes were not burned then, but residents were worried sick over family in burn zones and in the dark without communications, Mayor Melanie Bagby said.\n\nShe accused PG&E of failing to upgrade its equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable that we\u2019re in the situation that we\u2019re in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe pay our bills, and we gave PG&E a monopoly to guarantee we would have\u201d reliable power.\n\nBut Santa Rosa Mayor Tom Schwedhelm said he was grateful PG&E was taking proactive action. His city lost 5% of its housing in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 and torched nearly 6,000 structures in Sonoma and Napa counties. State investigators determined the fire was sparked by a private electrical system, and was not the fault of PG&E.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d much rather do this than address what we had to address two years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nHospitals would operate on backup power, but other systems could see their generators fail after a few days. Outages even posed a threat that fire hydrants wouldn\u2019t work at a time of extreme fire danger.\n\nThe East Bay Municipal Utility District serving Alameda and Contra Costa counties, recently spent $409,000 to rent 29 backup generators for use beginning at noon Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe backup generators that we have are stationed at the pumping plants, which pump water to the fire hydrants,\u201d spokeswoman Andrea Pook told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThe local tanks have been filled as much as we can, and we have made sure the generators are ready to go.\u201d\n\nCounties activated their emergency centers and authorities urged people to have supplies of water for several days, to keep sensitive medicines such as insulin in cool places, to drive carefully because traffic lights could be out, to have a full gas tank for emergencies and to check the food in freezers and refrigerators for spoilage after power is restored.\n\nPG&E set up about 30 community centers offering air conditioning, restrooms, bottled water and electronic charging stations during daylight hours.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf asked residents Tuesday not to clog 911 lines with non-emergencies and urged people to be prepared. The city canceled all police officers\u2019 days off in preparation for the outages.\n\n\u201cWe all know the devastation that fires can cause,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 1991, a grass fire torched the Oakland Hills, killing 25 people and destroying more than 3,000 homes.\n\nPG&E said it was informing customers by text and email about where and when the power would be cut. But its website, where it directed people to check whether their addresses would be affected, was not working most of the day Tuesday after being overloaded with visitors.\n\nAt the Dollar General store in Paradise, people were buying candles, gas cans, ice, flashlights, batteries and canned food, and the store ran out of ice chests Tuesday morning, manager Ben Humphries said.\n\nHumphries, who moved to Oroville with his family after losing his home in Paradise, said there was a sense of irony to PG&E\u2019s aggressive action in the area now, after the company opted not to turn off the power ahead of the Nov. 8 fire that wiped out Paradise.\n\n\u201cI understand their concerns. But in my opinion, it\u2019s too little too late. We already had our town burned to the ground,\u201d Humphries said.", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Bottled water and batteries were flying off the shelves at California stores as millions of customers prepared to live without", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/63b280_california-wildfires-power-shutoff-58922-james-cooke-is-shown-buying-water-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
