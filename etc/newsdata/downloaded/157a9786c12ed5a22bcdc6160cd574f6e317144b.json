(AP) - Looking for clean play in real games, the Atlanta Falcons welcomed additional enforcement to Wednesday\u2019s practice.\n\nFor the first time under coach Dan Quinn, a full crew of seven officials worked the session in their black and white striped shirts - plus a head official in a black shirt.\n\nThe Falcons normally have three officials at practices. A change was needed after Atlanta was called for 16 penalties, including 10 on defense, in last week\u2019s 27-24 loss at Indianapolis.\n\nQuinn said he talked to players before practice about eliminating mistakes , including turnovers, before Sunday\u2019s game against Tennessee.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make sure we\u2019re only fighting one team,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cNo more self-inflicted wounds that derail us. We\u2019re fighting Tennessee and only Tennessee. \u2026 I wanted to make sure we got the point across.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons have 35 penalties through three games, tied with Cleveland for the NFL lead.\n\nIt was time for more whistles - even if quarterback Matt Ryan says he barely noticed the additional striped shirts.\n\n\u201cYou focus on other things out there than the refs,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nQuinn said there is a \u201c100 percent\u201d sense of urgency for Atlanta (1-2) against the Titans.\n\nHe said one measure to address repeat violations of penalties will be \u201cin-house discipline, so to speak.\u201d\n\nThe in-house discipline may be administered in players-only meetings, possibly including fines.\n\n\u201cWe all have a lot of money, so $100 is not going to mean much,\u201d said defensive end Adrian Clayborn.\n\nOffensive guard Jamon Brown said multiple penalties are \u201cdefinitely going to cost you a pretty penny.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes you more aware about playing clean,\u201d Brown said before adding any fine levied by veteran players wouldn\u2019t be the most painful punishment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more the dishonor of being called out,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAdded Clayborn: \u201cNobody wants to get called out by your teammates.\u201d\n\nPenalties are not Atlanta\u2019s only problem. Another factor in the slow start is a minus-4 turnover ratio.\n\nQuinn, in his fifth season, is coming off a 7-9 finish in 2018 that was his first losing record in Atlanta. Injuries were a major problem last season, and now the Falcons have lost another key starter.\n\nFor the second straight opening month of a season, the Falcons must overcome a season-ending injury to strong safety Keanu Neal, who suffered a torn left Achilles tendon against the Colts.\n\nThe Falcons have fresh memories of how to adjust to losing Neal. As was the case last season, Kemal Ishmael will move up as Neal\u2019s primary replacement. There will be different combinations in the secondary on third down and passing situations.\n\nJamal Carter was signed from the practice squad to provide depth at safety. Carter had 11 tackles in 16 games as a rookie with Denver in 2017. He was signed to Atlanta\u2019s practice squad on Sept. 2.\n\nQuinn said Carter \u201cshowed some of the traits\u201d of speed and toughness the team liked through his three weeks of practice with the Falcons.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need your shot, need your chance,\u201d Quinn said, adding Carter has the talent to take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nThe Falcons had workouts for veteran safeties George Iloka and T.J. McDonald before bringing up Carter on Tuesday.\n\nThe Falcons placed Neal on injured reserve, waived punter Matt Wile and signed offensive tackle John Wetzel. Wile was re-signed to the practice squad on Wednesday, when punter Matt Bosher had only limited participation with his right groin injury.\n\nRunning backs Ito Smith and Kenjon Barner were held out with concussions. Barner also has a knee injury. Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett (toe) also did not practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Looking for clean play in real games, the Atlanta Falcons welcomed additional enforcement to Wednesday's practice.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/falcons_colts_football_44599_c0-190-4531-2831_s1770x1032.jpg?8184cd2c5ba86906d478e8f97006742df96ae9b8", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
