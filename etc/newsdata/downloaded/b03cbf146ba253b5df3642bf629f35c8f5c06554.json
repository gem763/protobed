But he was unnerved to learn the elected official was Tawanna P. Gaines, his longtime state representative.\n\n\u201cShe was supposed to be one of us,\u201d Luftman said the other day, sitting in the senior center next to the town hall where Gaines, 67, began her political career as a member of the town council. \u201cShe had a reputation for helping the little guy. But I guess no politician helps the little guy.\u201d\n\nGaines (D), who had a leadership role in the Maryland legislature before her abrupt resignation on Oct. 4, was charged with federal wire fraud Wednesday over allegedly using $22,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses. The crime appears to be smaller in scope than those committed by other Prince George\u2019s politicians, whose acceptance of cash bribes gave the county a reputation for corruption. But it nonetheless was met with frustration and sadness \u2014 at the highest levels of local government and in close-knit Berwyn Heights.\n\nGaines\u2019s attorney, William C. Brennan Jr., declined to comment, citing the pending case against the 18-year delegate, who according to court filings is expected to appear at a hearing on Thursday to enter a guilty plea.\n\nCounty Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) said in an interview that she worries the case will damage the county\u2019s reputation, making it more difficult to attract the kind of businesses and investments residents deserve.\n\n\u201cFew people were more disappointed than I was,\u201d Alsobrooks said. \u201cActions have consequences. Her actions have consequences for her and for this county.\u201d\n\n\n\nDel. Tawanna P. Gaines in 2006. (courtesy of Tawanna-P. Gaines)\n\n[Read Tawanna Gaines\u2019 resignation letter]\n\nFormer county executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) echoed other leaders who were stunned by the alleged wrongdoing, recalling that Gaines had supported his efforts to pass ethics reforms after former county executive Jack B. Johnson\u2019s arrest on public corruption charges in 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is something that hits you way out of left field,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThis is not a minor player. It\u2019s someone who delivered for the county and the state.\u201d\n\nGaines is accused of soliciting campaign donations that were directed to a PayPal account that was not disclosed in state campaign finance filings, then using the money for expenses not related to her job or political career.\n\nShe is the third Democratic politician from Prince George\u2019s to face criminal charges related to financial misconduct in the past two years \u2014 following former state delegates Michael L. Vaughn and William A. Campos, who were involved in a bribery scandal. Two former lawmakers from Baltimore have also been sentenced in the past two years on charges related to financial wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t like these numbers regarding Prince George\u2019s,\u201d said Del. Michael A. Jackson (D), who heads the Prince George\u2019s House delegation and said he has considered Gaines a friend for 20 years. \u201cBut we\u2019ll get through it. . . . At the end of the day, you\u2019re just going to find a lot of sad hearts.\u201d\n\nSome Prince George\u2019s officials said they believe politicians from the county, a majority-black jurisdiction where most elected officials are African American, are more heavily scrutinized than politicians in mostly white jurisdictions \u2014 and that the county\u2019s reputation is harder hit by the failings of its elected officials than in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn neighboring Washington, they pointed out, D.C. Council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who is white, remains in office despite being embroiled in an ethics scandal that led to an FBI raid on his Georgetown house. (Evans has not been charged with wrongdoing, however. And Republican members of Congress have cited the questions about his alleged conduct as one reason the District should not become a state.)\n\n\u201cSome people are quick to condemn and say, \u2018Here we go again, Prince George\u2019s,\u2019 \u201d said Greenbelt Mayor Emmett Jordan, urging people to avoid jumping to conclusions or rushing to condemn Gaines as corrupt before more information is available. \u201cBut there is more scrutiny about things that happen in Prince George\u2019s . . . I don\u2019t think these sorts of things aren\u2019t happening in other jurisdictions.\u201d\n\n[\u2018A word that has blood dripping off it\u2019: How a white lawmaker\u2019s slur reverberated in Maryland]\n\nThe Prince George\u2019s County Democratic Central Committee has until Nov. 4 to propose a replacement for Gaines to Gov. Larry Hogan (R). Committee Chair Cheryl Landis said she is in the process of scheduling a public hearing in District 22, which Gaines represented, where interested candidates can testify. The central committee will then vote.\n\nBoth Nicole Williams and Ashanti Martinez, who both ran unsuccessfully last year for one of the district\u2019s three House seats, said they are interested in seeking the appointment. Jordan said he is considering vying for the seat, as well.\n\nWilliams and Martinez said the departure of Gaines, who was the vice chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, will leave a void in the legislature.\n\n\u201cHer knowledge and skill set is something that is going to be sorely missed for Prince George\u2019s,\u201d said Williams, who came in fourth in last year\u2019s Democratic primary.\n\nMartinez, who came in fifth, said he is \u201cshocked that this is how her legacy will be remembered.\u201d\n\nThe two aspiring lawmakers also said they hope the episode leads to a conversation about salaries for state representatives, who are paid about $50,000 for what is considered a part-time position.\n\nIn the senior center in Berwyn Heights, a wooded enclave between Greenbelt and College Park, residents said Thursday that they were appalled when they learned of the allegation against Gaines, who used to frequently stop by the center. Gaines was elected in the 1990s as the first African American council member in Berwyn Heights, and she served as the town\u2019s first female mayor.\n\nLuftman, while holding court in the senior center after lunch, said he was told \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that Gaines had stolen $220,000 in campaign funds.\n\n\u201cIt was $22,000,\u201d a longtime resident in a pink sweater, who declined to give her name, corrected him from across the room. \u201cAnd no politics allowed here!\u201d\n\nTown manager Maria Broadbent described Gaines as an \u201cactive listener and kindhearted person\u201d who was invested in the people of Berwyn Heights. She declined to comment on the charges against the former delegate.\n\nWalking her dog outside the town hall, Shira Frances, who moved to Berwyn Heights last year, said she didn\u2019t know Gaines but was disappointed to hear about the charges.\n\n\u201cAre we becoming Baltimore?\u201d she asked, referring to a corruption investigation of former Baltimore mayor Catherine E. Pugh (D) and other recent scandals in that city. \u201cIt would be great to have politicians who weren\u2019t corrupt.\u201d\n\nOvetta Wiggins contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nDel.
