According to our findings, the suspect Stephan B. aimed to carry out a massacre,\" federal prosecutor Peter Frank said.\n\nFrank said the suspect appears to have built several of his own weapons and that explosives were also found in his car.\n\nAlso on rt.com Halle\u2019s \u2018Nazi killer\u2019: How blind hatred fueled a deadly shooting spree in Germany\n\nThe gunman broadcast yesterday's hate-fuelled attack on the Twitch live-streaming service. During the stream, he said Jews were \"the root of all problems\" and blamed feminism for declining birth rates in Western countries.\n\nConcerns mounted after the attack that the shooter had acted with others, but latest reports suggest the attacker was a \"lone wolf\" case. Police did not confirm reports made by other officials that additional perpetrators had fled the scene in a hijacked car.\n\nThe gunman also put an explosive device in front of the door of the synagogue as worshippers were gathering for the Yom Kippur holiday, but it failed to explode and was defused by police. German officials believe the man had a \"right-wing extremist background.\"\n\nHe also posted a manifesto explaining his motivation and weaponry online before the attack. German media reports said the suspect saw the Christchurch massacre shooter as inspiration, but it is unclear exactly why the German radicalized or how.\n\nLike this story?
