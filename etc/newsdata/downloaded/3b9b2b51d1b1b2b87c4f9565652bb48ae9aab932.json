IAN BIRRELL finds how one small sign sums up the state of our divided nation", "language": "en", "text": "Captain Jean-Luc Picard should have known better than to trust our weather.\n\nBut scarcely had Sir Patrick Stewart pointed to the symbolism of the sun shining on the People\u2019s Vote campaign than drops of rain began to fall on the marchers massed near Parliament.\n\nIt did not dampen the mood of defiance. Hoods went over heads and umbrellas were unfurled as the Hollywood star finished an impassioned speech in his rich thespian tones to fellow protesters demanding a second Brexit referendum.\n\nMany of the demonstrators carried homemade banners. Some were angry, some crude, some offensive \u2013 but lots of them displayed very typical British wit. \u2018I am quite cross,\u2019 read one. \u2018I voted Remain but all I got was this lousy Brexit,\u2019 read another\n\nThen a big screen switched to the proceedings a few hundred feet away in the chamber as MPs voted on the Letwin amendment \u2013 and there was jubilation at seeing tellers deliver a result forcing Boris Johnson into another Brexit extension.\n\n\u2018What we have done is historic because we defeated Johnson again,\u2019 said Shadow Brexit Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who was met by cheers from the crowd.\n\n\u2018We are not going to let him rip us out with this sellout deal.\u2019\n\nSo regardless of the rain, those seeking to stop Brexit \u2013 or at least give the public a final say \u2013 continue to make much of the political weather.\n\nSir Patrick Stewart pointed to the symbolism of the sun shining on the People\u2019s Vote campaign than drops of rain began to fall on the marchers massed near Parliament. It did not dampen the mood of defiance\n\n\u2018We are united in believing every form of Brexit is worse than remaining in the European Union,\u2019 said London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nThe Mayor\u2019s message that \u2018Brexit has been a complete and utter mess\u2019 was backed by hundreds of thousands of people who descended on Central London yesterday to demonstrate in favour of a \u2018final say\u2019 referendum.\n\nBanners showed protesters had come from Aberdeen to Cornwall, many of them draped in EU colours or carrying its blue and gold starred flag.\n\n\u2018We are European,\u2019 tweeted television chef Rick Stein, sharing an image of himself on the march.\n\nFootage posted to social media showed Rees-Mogg, his young son Peter, and Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom being heckled by demonstrators as they left Parliament under police escort to shouts of \u2018shame\u2019\n\nAmong the protesters was Pauline Smith, 70, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, who said she was demonstrating for her six grandchildren but also honouring her father Tommy, who had fought at El Alamein in the Second World War and who died last year.\n\n\u2018He thought his lasting legacy was peace in Europe and so he loved the EU, with countries having to co-operate,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018We have to stop the injustice of Brexit.\u2019\n\nThis was the fourth \u2013 and biggest according to the organisers \u2013 march run by the People\u2019s Vote campaign since the referendum took place 40 long months ago.\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote claimed one million people took part yesterday after they distributed 1.5 million leaflets, with 172 coaches bringing in people to join a demonstration designed to fuel the pressure on deadlocked parliamentarians.\n\nA spokesman admitted, however, that it was impossible \u2018to put an exact figure on the crowd\u2019 as the march meandered from Hyde Park to Parliament Square, where protesters gathered for speeches under Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s statue.\n\nHugo Dixon, deputy chairman of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, told me they were putting on a show of force to influence all the forthcoming critical votes in Parliament so that MPs gave the electorate the final say on Brexit.\n\n\u2018Public opinion has turned against Brexit,\u2019 said Mr Dixon. \u2018It would be undemocratic not to check with the people if they still wish to amputate ourselves from our continent. I\u2019m moderately optimistic we will win. But nothing is in the bag.\u2019\n\nI stopped to chat with one man holding a banner in Latin reading \u2018Tempora mutant, et nos in illis mutamur\u2019 which translates as \u2018Times change and we change with them\u2019 \u2013 even if the grammar wasn\u2019t quite correct\n\nMany of the demonstrators carried homemade banners. Some were angry, some crude, some offensive \u2013 but lots of them displayed very typical British wit.\n\n\u2018I am quite cross,\u2019 read one. \u2018I voted Remain but all I got was this lousy Brexit,\u2019 read another.\n\nEven some dogs dragged along were clad in blue and gold. An affable woman from Worcester told me she was doing a roaring trade selling \u2018B******s to Brexit\u2019 socks from her table stall.\n\nAnother man flogged toilet paper featuring Donald Trump\u2019s face for \u00a33 a roll.\n\nThere was even a contingent of men and women carrying \u2018Tories Against Brexit\u2019 banners, which included former councillors and local party officials.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not all behind Boris,\u2019 one yelled at photographers taking their picture.\n\nAmong them was ex-Tory MP Keith Best. \u2018I went in with Margaret Thatcher in 1979,\u2019 he said.\n\nOne group of protesters pulled a float depicting key Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings in what seemed to be a Nazi uniform with an armband reading \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019 and depicting Johnson as his puppet\n\n\u2018It was she who conceived the single market and the idea of majority voting to protect the concept. We\u2019ve shaped Europe and we should continue to shape it.\u2019\n\nHe added that he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 by his party, saying it had become a caucus of the hard-Right.\n\n\u2018It is no longer the pragmatic organisation I joined, which was a broad church.\u2019\n\nThis bevy of bold blues mingled with the usual ragtag of hard-Left reds, a sprinkling of Greens and scores of people displaying yellow stickers of the Lib Dems.\n\nI stopped to chat with one man holding a banner in Latin reading \u2018Tempora mutant, et nos in illis mutamur\u2019 which translates as \u2018Times change and we change with them\u2019 \u2013 even if the grammar wasn\u2019t quite correct.\n\nHe told me it was aimed at Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, both fond of classical quips.\n\nIt turned out he was a former Tory voter whose Lib Dem membership had arrived in the post yesterday morning.\n\n\u2018I was a businessman who knows the importance of selling into Europe,\u2019 said Nigel Middlemiss, 72, who worked for an analytics firm.\n\nFootage posted to social media showed Rees-Mogg, his young son Peter, and Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom being heckled by demonstrators as they left Parliament under police escort to shouts of \u2018shame\u2019.\n\nEven some dogs dragged along were clad in blue and gold. An affable woman from Worcester told me she was doing a roaring trade selling \u2018B******s to Brexit\u2019 socks from her table stall\n\nOne group of protesters pulled a float depicting key Downing Street aide Dominic Cummings in what seemed to be a Nazi uniform with an armband reading \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019 and depicting Johnson as his puppet.\n\nIt was designed by German artist Jacques Tilly \u2013 who previously made a sculpture of Theresa May with her nose impaling a man in a bowler hat \u2013 and had been driven from Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday by Phil Jeanes, who lives in Essen.\n\n\u2018He put 14 sketches together and we chose what we thought would be the best,\u2019 said Mr Jeanes, 67, who is retired and married to a German.\n\nMeanwhile, a small group of pro-Brexit campaigners confronted the crowds in Westminster, one sporting a T-shirt saying \u2018Back Boris\u2019 and another wearing a Ukip baseball cap.\n\nJason Hurt, 48, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with \u2018I voted Leave\u2019 and said people who voted for Brexit were being ignored. \u2018I want my voice heard. It is always about the Remainers, never about the Leavers. There are 17.4 million of us.\u2019\n\nInevitably they were challenged. A pair of men \u2013 one with a loud hailer \u2013 repeatedly shouted \u2018Stop Brexit\u2019 only to be met by rival chants demanding Brexit.\n\nThe scene beside the Mother of Parliaments symbolised the deadlocked debate torturing our nation: two sides shouting slogans at each other but neither listening.\n\nPerhaps the most pertinent sign was held aloft by Alan Tongue, 80, a freelance conductor of music from Cambridge.\n\nIt read simply \u2018Madness\u2019 in small black lettering. \u2018It doesn\u2019t refer to the pop group,\u2019 he said with a smile.\n\nOne man\u2019s small sign amid the sound and fury of massed marchers demanding another referendum.\n\nYet it sums up the state of our divided nation. The final Brexit frontier, wherever it lies, still seems far off. Beam me up, Scotty.", "description": "IAN BIRRELL: Many of the demonstrators carried homemade banners.
