I did decide immediately right in the hour when I realised that we were going to lose is that I should take responsibility - that's why I stepped down as leader. I just thought the buck stops with me so I've got take responsibility,' he told the Sunday Herald Sun.\n\nFormer Labor leader Bill Shorten has opened up about why he believes he lost the federal election in his first interview since his May defeat at the polling booths\n\nThe 52-year-old (pictured with wife Chloe) explained he takes personal responsibility for Labor's loss and that he believes the franking credit saga and too many political messages led to his party's defeat\n\nHe explained that even as all the polls had Labor down to win he never thought the election was in the bag.\n\nHe revealed he had three speeches prepared for the night of the election - a winning speech, a speech where the outcome was not clear, and a defeat speech.\n\nAt 6.30pm the polls showed Labor winning but by 7.30pm the momentum had changed with Mr Shorten recalling he said to 'get speech number three out'.\n\n'I felt for my family who I had taken on the journey for the best part of six years and they'd invested a lot in giving sacrifice - from Chloe to the kids. I felt for volunteers, for my staff, for my MP colleagues who had worked so hard. It's not just your own disappointment - it's also other people's disappointment'.\n\nMr Shorten says he believes two main things led to Labor's unexpected defeat - too many messages led voters to think the party did not have a solid plan and tax reforms around franking credits.\n\n'I think we had too many messages in hindsight. In a universe where you can re-run things... fewer messages. I also accept... tax reforms around franking credits created a sense of vulnerability and anxiety among older Australians which I clearly underestimated,' he said.\n\nHis wife Chloe has also chosen to remain in public life throwing herself into her writing and saying she wants to focus on what she can achieve for Australian mother's and families\n\nHe said the last few months had been a journey in which he realised he still wanted to devote his life to public service - but ruled out any future leadership challenges saying he has 'hung up his leadership running shoes'.\n\nHe has taken a role on new Labor leader Anthony Albanese's front bench and a role overseeing the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\n\nHis wife Chloe has also chosen to remain in public life throwing herself into her writing and saying she wants to focus on what she can achieve for Australian mother's and families.\n\nMr Shorten has taken a role on new Labor leader Anthony Albanese's front bench and a role overseeing the National Disability Insurance Scheme\n\n\n\n", "description": "Former Labor leader Bill Shorten has opened up about why he believes he lost the federal election and why he has chosen to remain in Canberra rather than transfer into the corporate world.", "authors": ["Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/12/19330610-0-image-a-13_1570273980756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
