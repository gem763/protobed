REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n\nMONTREAL (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday he will continue to advocate for a settlement on trade between the United States and Europe and called the imposition of tariffs a \u201close-lose game\u201d on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe United States was granted approval this month to impose tariffs on European Union goods with an annual trade value of around $7.5 billion, over illegal government support for the European planemaker.\n\n\u201cWe think a trade war on aviation will be a lose-lose game,\u201d Faury told reporters in Montreal. \u201cWe continue to advocate for a settlement on this topic and we think it\u2019s still possible.\u201d\n\nTariffs, he warned, would raise costs on planes ordered by carriers at a specific price years ago.\n\nThe World Trade Organization has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) received billions of dollars of subsidies in a pair of cases marking the world\u2019s largest ever corporate trade dispute. Both sides have threatened tariffs after the Geneva body found neither adhered fully to its findings.\n\nWashington sought permission to impose tariffs up to 100% on European goods worth $11.2 billion a year. Those include aircraft and aerospace parts from Airbus host nations - Britain, France, Germany and Spain - as well a range of goods including wine, cheese and luxury goods from across the EU.\n\nRoughly 40% of an Airbus aircraft is U.S. content, Faury said.\n\nThe company operates a final assembly line for its narrowbody planes in Alabama.", "description": "Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday he will continue to advocate for a settlement on trade between the United States and Europe and called the imposition of tariffs a \"lose-lose game\" on both sides of the Atlantic.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434320836&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P25A", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
