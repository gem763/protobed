The Connecticut Sun have thrived on terrific performances from guard Courtney Williams on both ends of the floor.\n\nBut with all due respect to the guards and wings, it\u2019s the bigs who will decide the WNBA Finals.\n\nWhen Washington hosts Game 5 of the best-of-five series Thursday night at the Entertainment and Sports Arena, the Mystics faithful could see one of the league\u2019s oldest franchises lift the championship trophy for the first time.\n\nWhatever the outcome, they\u2019ll see a physical battle among some of the most talented fours and fives in the league: Washington\u2019s Elena Delle Donne and Emma Meesseman and Connecticut\u2019s Jonquel Jones and Alyssa Thomas.\n\nThe MVP back on the block\n\nAs pained as she is by a herniated disk pinching a nerve in her back, Delle Donne is playing through it in the most important moment of her professional career. After playing 30 minutes Tuesday, she said she felt looser than she did in Game 3.\n\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll continue to progress and feel even better Thursday,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cThey were playing more aggressive defensively. They weren\u2019t just letting us sit outside and shoot threes comfortably. So I was trying to just draw attention by driving and hoping to get other people open.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s key \u2014 although Washington made 10 of 21 from the arc in Game 4 and has shot 47.3% from there for the series, by now the Sun know better than to give up many open looks from outside.\n\nThis is where a 6-foot-5 All-Star stationed down low would come in handy. But Mystics coach Mike Thibault said Delle Donne\u2019s injury has made it harder for her to post up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how she feels come Thursday,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cBut that would be something we would need to do a little bit better is get an inside versus outside game. They had 26 points in the paint in the first half and we had in the teens. You know, we\u2019ve got to get her some touches in different spots on the floor.\u201d\n\nJones an anchor down low\n\nThe Game 4 shot chart says it all: Though she only attempted 10 shots, four of Jones\u2019 five baskets came from the paint or the right block. Ten attempts is a bit low for Jones, but Connecticut coach Curt Miller was happy with what his center was able to do without the ball.\n\n\u201cWe went stretches without her touching it, which was frustrating, but her activity never stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought she was really active around the glass, even when she wasn\u2019t touching.\u201d\n\nThe Sun usually need to outrebound their opponents to win games. When Delle Donne missed most of Game 2, the Sun dominated the Mystics on the boards 41 to 27, and Jones grabbed 18 rebounds \u2014 nine offensive, nine defensive.\n\nIn Games 3 and 4, Jones still led all players with nine and 13 boards, respectively. But almost all of those came off the defensive glass, which Washington doesn\u2019t mind. Mystics center LaToya Sanders knew why that number was so high Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the majority of her rebounds were defensive rebounds, so \u2014 make shots?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cMake shots so she don\u2019t get defensive rebounds. I feel like we did a good job again with her on the offensive rebounds \u2026 We had a couple bunnies, chippy shots that we missed, so if we do that obviously her rebounds will go down.\u201d\n\nThomas keeping the offense moving\n\nMiller has called Thomas the best facilitating power forward in the WNBA, \u201cwith the exception of maybe Candace Parker.\u201d That\u2019s high praise, but check her numbers: 11 assists in Game 4, following nine in Game 3.\n\nThomas took on a point-forward role for much of Game 4, something Washington didn\u2019t defend particularly well. Miller said that gave the Sun better spacing and a different attack.\n\n\u201c(The Mystics are) too talented, they\u2019re too well-coached to do anything for too long,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut in stretches tonight with Alyssa starting the offense, we were really, really productive. Some of our most productive offense came with her running the offense.\u201d\n\nBy the way, Delle Donne isn\u2019t the only one playing hurt. Thomas is putting up her numbers despite a torn labrum in not one, but both of her shoulders.\n\nMeesseman the leading scorer\n\nThe only Mystic to score in double figures in all four games of this series, Meesseman is a \u201csecret weapon\u201d no longer. Washington badly needs her to score to win.\n\nUnlike Delle Donne, Meesseman doesn\u2019t dominate in the post, but she can knock down shots from anywhere. She was held scoreless in the first half on five field goal tries Tuesday, then got her game going again in the second half once the Mystics began passing more, she said.\n\nDepending on Delle Donne\u2019s health, the Mystics\u2019 offense in Game 5 could need some plays designed for Meesseman to get free using the MVP as a decoy.\n\nThe Mystics came close to the title Tuesday, leading by as many as five points in the fourth quarter despite a 16-point halftime deficit. So players like Sanders say they like where they\u2019re at entering the decisive Game 5.\n\n\u201cPeople know that we\u2019re going back home, going to our houses, our beds, our food,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI just like our mindset. We know that we gave this one away. We gave this one away. So we\u2019re just gonna get ready, get our bodies ready for another 40-minute fight.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
