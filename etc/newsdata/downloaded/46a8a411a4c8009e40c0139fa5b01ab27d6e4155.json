Survivors of the camps, mostly Kazakhs or Uyghurs married to foreign nations who appealed abroad for their freedom, say they were subject to forced sterilization and beatings, forced to memorize Communist Party propaganda songs, affirm their loyalty for dictator Xi Jinping, and serve as sex slaves for guards at the camps. Some also accused China of using the prisoners for slave labor to manufacture products sold in, among other places, the United States.\n\nThe Chinese government published the favorable statement in full.\n\nBelarus, claiming to speak on behalf of other draconian states like Russia, Bolivia, Pakistan, and Democratic Republic of Congo, condemned \u201cpoliticizing human rights issues by naming and shaming\u201d human rights violators.\n\n\u201cFaced with the grave challenge of terrorism and extremism, China has undertaken a series of counter-terrorism and deradicalization measures in Xinjiang, including setting up vocational education and training centers,\u201d Belarus said, using China\u2019s preferred term for the concentration camps. \u201cThe past three consecutive years has [sic] seen not a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang and people there enjoy a stronger sense of happiness, fulfillment and security.\u201d\n\nDespite the Chinese regime severely limiting the entry of foreigners or other Chinese people from elsewhere in the country into Xinjiang, the note said the countries \u201cappreciate China\u2019s commitment to openness and transparency,\u201d referencing a staged \u201cmedia access\u201d tour China organized for the state media of various friendly countries.\n\nThe statement concluded by condemning those standing up for human rights and demanding they \u201crefrain from employing unfounded charges against China based on unconfirmed information before they visit Xinjiang,\u201d which they cannot do freely.\n\nThe statement followed an attack against human rights defenders in July by a coalition of countries with deep business ties to China for demanding accountability on the Xinjiang camps.\n\nBelarus has a longstanding human rights record that the United Nations defined as \u201cfundamentally poor\u201d in July. It has only ever had one president since achieving independence from the Soviet Union. pro-Russia autocrat Alexander Lukashenko. Among the human rights crimes Lukashenko stands guilty of are the arbitrary arrest and silencing of journalists and dissidents and widespread regulations on speech and assembly.\n\nBelarus is an \u201cimportant\u201d partner to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), according to Beijing. The BRI is a sprawling infrastructure project nominally meant to expand modern transportation to connect Beijing to Western Europe. In reality, China has used the BRI to hand out predatory loans to developing countries, many of which then embezzle the money and leave the government deeply in debt. China then takes ownership of key properties in those countries, expanding its political reach.\n\nDictator Xi Jinping last visited Minsk in June to discuss the expansion of BRI projects.\n\nBRI has, in part, silenced Muslim countries that would otherwise have a vested interest in defending Chinese Muslims from human rights atrocities. In addition to Pakistan, which co-signed the Belarussian statement at the U.N., countries like Malaysia and Turkey have also defended the camps. The Uyghurs are an ethnic Turkic people, making that country\u2019s support all the more incongruent with its interests.\n\nBelarus\u2019s statement on Tuesday was a response to one by the ambassador to the United Kingdom representing 23 democracies \u2013 including America, Japan, Australia, Albania, and Canada.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Chinese government to uphold its national laws and international obligations and commitments to respect human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, in Xinjiang and across China,\u201d the statement read, demanding China allow the U.N. \u201cmeaningful access to Xinjiang\u201d without complete control over where inspectors go and what they see.\n\nThe NGO Human Rights Watch published evidence in April that the Chinese regime is bullying developing nations into silence on Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cFor years China has worked behind the scenes to weaken UN human rights mechanisms,\u201d Geneva director for Human Rights Watch John Fisher said at the time. \u201cBut the growing global outcry over its mistreatment of Xinjiang\u2019s Muslims has sent China into panic mode, using public as well as private pressure to block concerted international action.\u201d \u201cIt speaks volumes that China felt it necessary to twist arms and mount propaganda displays to try to suppress scrutiny of its rights record. Now it\u2019s up to governments to take action at the June Council session and show that China is being held to international rights standards,\u201d Fisher added. In September, Chinese state media openly warned other countries not to use the General Assembly\u2019s general debate, in which all members\u2019 heads of state are invited to speak on any issue, to demand justice for Xinjiang.-", "description": "A group of 54 United Nations members issued a statement Tuesday defending China for building over 1,000 concentration camps for Muslims.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/CHINA-POLITICS-RIGHTS-RELIGION-XINJIANG-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
