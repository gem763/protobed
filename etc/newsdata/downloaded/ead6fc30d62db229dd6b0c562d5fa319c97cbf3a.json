Hughes said the lower Delaware county has had limited resources for dealing with these types of health crises.\n\n\"Prior to Michelle being here, if a person was in a mental health crisis, we may have to transport them to an emergency room, to Nanticoke Hospital or Beebe Hospital,\" he said. \"It could be several hours (before) going to the hospital room. That is not the most appropriate place for that type of illness to be.\"\n\nAmy Kevis, Connections Director of Criminal Justice & Community partnership, Michelle Robinson, Licensed Mental Health Clinician through the Connections Alliance, and R.L.

Commonly known by the brand name Narcan, this medication can be used in life-threatening emergencies to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose. Bringing Robinson on board adds another tool to that same toolbox.\n\n\"I do not want to have to go and tell someone\u2019s mother that their son or daughter has died if we can try to do something,\" Hughes said. \"We\u2019re going to do something.\"\n\nA big part of Robinson's job is simply listening \u2014 keeping her ear to the radio so that she can identify the types of calls that may benefit from her expertise and looking out for opportunities to educate officers about what kind of help she's able to provide.\n\nSometimes that means dropping what she's doing to intercede at unexpected moments, like when she popped into the station at night to finish up some paperwork or even just 20 minutes before she sat down with DelmarvaNow for an interview.\n\nWATCH: Why Maryland opioid efforts refocus on treatment\n\nRELATED: 'There's a way out': Hamilton House in Berlin to those struggling with addiction\n\n\"I can be right there to do that one-on-one assessment and talk to them and actually make the phone calls and get them connected,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe Georgetown-Connections Alliance, which is the first program of its kind in Sussex County, is paid for by the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services' Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health. Similar initiatives have already been underway in both New Castle and Smyrna.\n\n\"I think in Georgetown, even in these early stages, we\u2019re seeing that the folks that need a lot of help are getting that help and that through the intervention with the clinician who\u2019s placed with that agency, they\u2019re getting kind of that loose case management,\" said Amy Kevis, Connections director for criminal justice and community partnerships.\n\nTown of Georgetown Police Department.

While that may be the right avenue for some, it isn't the one size fits all answer to the problem.\n\nMore often, she explained, it's beneficial for people working through these types of disorders to return to their communities and build a support system. That's where someone like Robinson comes in to provide that critical aftercare piece by touching base with people to make sure they're staying on track.\n\nThe ability to follow up with Robinson is essential not only for those who have made the decision to seek treatment, but also for those who may not have been immediately ready.\n\n\"I know we had one individual who one of the clinicians asked and the guy said, \u2018I just don\u2019t have it in my heart to get sober right now,' \" Kevis said. \"That\u2019s heartbreaking, but at least you\u2019ve extended a hand to that person and in Georgetown, they\u2019ll be able to come back maybe later on.\"\n\nThat's why, she said, it's important to make mental health and substance abuse resources available around the clock. When someone's decides at 3:30 in the morning they're ready to seek treatment, waiting until 8 a.m. or being forced to sit in the emergency room may not be an option when the sickness of withdrawal is hours away.\n\nThe Georgetown-Connections Alliance pilot program is set to last through April, but Hughes is confident the agency will be able to secure additional funding to continue the partnership.\n\nBringing a mental health clinician into the department to build relationships with those in crisis illustrates not only the dedication to community policing, he said, but also an effort to improve long-term efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nIn the past, he explained arrests may have been made because there was nothing else to do, nowhere to take that person in crisis, but Robinson's new role with the department offers an alternative \u2014 a way to save and transform lives instead.\n\n\"I\u2019ll be the first person to admit sometimes that arrest took place and it probably should not have,\" Hughes said. \"I get that. We\u2019ve made mistakes, but I think this is a better way of doing business for us and I know it\u2019s a better way to take care of our community.\u201d\n\nFor more information about accessing mental health and substance abuse resources, visit www.connectionscsp.org or call 1-833-886-227.\n\nRELATED: Drug overdoses driven by opioids are a leading killer in Virginia\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: 6 benefits of a Delmarva Now digital subscription\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/delaware/2019/03/12/substance-abuse-mental-health-treatment-top-focus-police-program/3090626002/", "description": "Georgetown, Delaware police now have a clinician riding along with an officer to connect people with mental health and substance abuse resources.", "authors": ["Rose Velazquez", "Published A.M.
