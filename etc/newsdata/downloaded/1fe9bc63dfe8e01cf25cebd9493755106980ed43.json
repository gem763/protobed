Locals, though, were less than impressed.\n\nMois\u00e9s Aguilar Torres, the mayor of the town of Pichucalco in Chiapas, told his staff to arrange for the cardboard stand-in to be created and brought to public events he can\u2019t attend.\n\nThe cutout depicts the mayor, who was a registered nurse before turning to politics, dressed in a blue shirt, stepping forward with one hand raised in a fist.\n\nMoises Aguilar Torres, NO asiste a ning\u00fan evento y en su lugar env\u00eda una foto de \u00e9l, en tama\u00f1o normal. Es alcalde de uno de los municipios de Chiapas, pero \u00e9l no se rebaja y no asistir\u00e1, a lugares \"Chusma\" como Pichucalco, de donde es alcalde.
