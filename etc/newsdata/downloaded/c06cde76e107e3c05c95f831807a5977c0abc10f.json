It didn\u2019t fit their ongoing narrative that people are born gay, cannot change, and therefore it\u2019s just like race or ethnicity. Anyone who says otherwise is a \u201chater.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s always been an invalid comparison. Unlike biologically immutable and morally neutral traits such as race, sex or ethnicity, sexual behavior is volitional and has moral, social and health implications.\n\nInstead of reporting the limitations of this new study up front, the media deployed misleading headlines, knowing that few people read beyond them.\n\nThe New York Times headline was: \u201cMany Genes Influence Same-Sex Sexuality, not a single \u2018gay gene.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post entry was: \u201cStudy: No \u2018gay gene,\u2019 but genetics linked to same-sex behavior.\u201d\n\nAh, so there\u2019s no single gene, but being gay must still be caused somehow by genetics. The study, which involved more than 490,000 people, shows that same-sex behavior is \u201ca natural part of our diversity as a species,\u201d according to lead author Andrea Ganna of the Institute of Molecular Medicine in Finland.\n\nThe article in the August 30, 2019 edition of Science does have caveats against hasty conclusions about causation.\n\nThe study suggests that various genetic factors together may correlate with perhaps a third of the variation in same-sex sexual behavior, whose incidence is as little as 2 percent of the population, and which could be a single encounter for many people. This means the vast majority of instances of same-sex behavior correlate with social, cultural and environmental factors\u2014not genetics.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal had perhaps the most misleading headline: \u201cGenetics Tied To Same-Sex Behavior.\u201d However, in the very last paragraph, readers learn an inconvenient truth:\n\nResearchers \u201cworked with several advocacy and alliance groups, such as Sense about Science and GLAAD [the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a media pressure group), and received feedback on the science and how to best communicate the findings. The authors then rewrote sections of the paper to highlight the focus on behavior rather than a person\u2019s identity or orientation.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the original findings damaged the idea of the \u201cgay gene\u201d so badly that the researchers were pressured into recasting the data.\n\nImagine the outrage if, say, researchers rewrote tobacco smoke studies to please cigarette company lawyers.\n\nA dishonest axis between politically correct sex researchers and activist media has been afoot since Alfred C. Kinsey wooed credulous reporters before publishing his groundbreaking and fraudulent study of male sexual behavior in 1948. He did the same with his volume on female sexuality in 1953. Eager to validate casual sex of all kinds, the media have suppressed negative medical evidence about certain behaviors while hyping fake science, such as genetic studies that fail to be replicated.\n\n\u201cTo be succinct, this study is not worth very much,\u201d said David Pickup, a California-based license marriage and family therapist. \u201cThe title and article implies there are many genes that cause homosexuality, then the statement underneath the title says there\u2019s no way genes can predict sexual preference. It\u2019s the same old attempt to influence public beliefs. What\u2019s actually relevant is that they admit in the article there are environmental (emotional) influences that have a bearing on sexuality.\u201d\n\nThis is important because the LGBTQ movement is on a jihad to criminalize professionally licensed counseling aimed at reducing homosexual or gender dysphoric inclinations \u2013 even if a client wants it.\n\nTheir main argument is that if people are born gay or transgender and can\u2019t change, then any effort to assist them to do so amounts to malpractice or even criminal activity. With this reasoning, the far-left Southern Poverty Law Center managed to persuade a liberal judge in New Jersey to rule that a small Jewish group had committed consumer fraud simply because they referred people to counselors who specialize in reparative therapy.\n\nBut this affects far more than counselors. The myth that people are born gay and cannot possibly change is a direct rejection of the Christian gospel of sin and redemption. It has fueled a dangerously unconstitutional movement to criminalize traditional moral views regarding sexuality.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to treat everyone with respect. It\u2019s quite another to use cultural and political power to crush dissent and force people to lie. These are the seeds of tyranny.\n\nStar quarterback Drew Brees is the latest to feel the love. He made a short video for Focus on the Family promoting \u201cBring Your Bible to School Day\u201d and is now being hammered as \u201canti-LGBT\u201d because Focus supports traditional family values.\n\nAs America reels under the Left\u2019s many infringements on our liberties, Big Brother is taking the form of a fist in a rainbow-colored glove.\n\nBut they won\u2019t have the \u201cgay gene\u201d in that glove anymore.", "description": "The media outdid themselves last week when reporting on a .09/10/2019 3:41:28AM EST.", "authors": ["Robert Knight", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/169/a26a2666-fba9-49fb-84d9-73028eeb4c3f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
