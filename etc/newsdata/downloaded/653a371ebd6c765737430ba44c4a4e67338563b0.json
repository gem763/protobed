Cummings wrote in a joint letter to Mr. Pompeo.\n\nThe committee heads said they have also scheduled depositions with five State Department officials over the next two weeks.

Ulrich Brechbuhl and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.\n\nThe subpoena comes as Democrats ramp up impeachment efforts after a whistleblower said Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated an impeachment inquiry this week.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
