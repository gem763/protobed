This Rugby World Cup semi-final was all white.\n\nIn Yokahama on Saturday, it took just over a minute for England to breach New Zealand\u2019s rugby citadel. By the end of 80 minutes they had well and truly sacked it.\n\nEddie Jones\u2019s England players played with breathtaking power and precision to win 19-7, a result that not only puts them within touching distance of a second World Cup crown, but arguably re-calibrates world rugby\u2019s pecking order.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand are the gods of rugby so we had to take it to them and put them on the back foot as much as we could,\u201d smiled Jones.\n\nNew Zealand were battered in possession, taunted by England\u2019s superb handling, and kicked to shreds by George Ford. How they must have wished for the boot of Dan Carter or the Richie McCaw-ness of Richie McCaw.\n\nInstead, almost 69,000 rugby fans witnessed that most rare of sporting apparitions: an outfought, outplayed and flustered New Zealand team.\n\n\u201cWe were beaten by the better team,\u201d All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said. \u201cTake it on the chin. Hard to stomach but this is what happens in sport sometimes. Sometimes sport isn\u2019t fair but tonight it was.\u201d\n\nDEMOLITION OF AN ICON\n\nWith more English territory, possession and set pieces won, the statistics of this clash tell their own tale, but this was about much more than figures and scores and percentages; this was the surgical, forensic demolition of a sporting icon.\n\nLong the byword for rugby invincibility, the All Blacks had been unbeaten in 19 World Cup matches going back to 2007 - 18 wins and a technical draw after their clash with Italy here was cancelled due to a typhoon.\n\nEngland\u2019s record against the three-times World Cup winners had offered no real comfort \u2014 seven wins from 41 games, none at the World Cup and only one victory, in 2012, in their last 16 clashes.\n\nYet for all the pyrotechnics and theatrics with which organisers heralded this semi-final \u2014 thunderous Japanese drumming and flame cannons shooting fire into the darkening skies before kick-off \u2013 little could prepare spectators for what would unfold.\n\nAll day this had felt special. There is something about this England squad.\n\nAnd when they metaphorically embraced the famous haka with a v-shape formation of their own before kick-off, rejecting absolutely the intimidation many nations feel at the sight of the traditional Maori ceremonial challenge, all bets were off.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had to be in a radius,\u201d skipper Owen Farrell said. \u201cWe wanted to not stand there and have them come at us. We wanted to have a respectful distance but we didn\u2019t want to be just a flat line and have them come at us.\u201d\n\nOther teams have confronted the haka in novel ways before, but most of them have gone on to lose.\n\nRugby Union - Rugby World Cup - Semi Final - England v New Zealand - International Stadium Yokohama, Yokohama, Japan - October 26, 2019.

REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nHAKA CONFRONTED\n\nNot this England side, though, and with less than 100 seconds on the clock, a magnificent flurry of passing ended in centre Manu Tuilagi punching through the All Blacks\u2019 defence from close range for a try.\n\nDominant England wasted a handful of chances, but added to their score just before the break through a George Ford penalty.\n\nThat half must have made for uncomfortable viewing for the whole of New Zealand as their All Blacks went in trailing 10-0, although some might have felt relief that the deficit was so small.\n\nTheir reputation as one of the greatest teams in any sport has been hard won, however, and it was perhaps inevitable England would be made to pay for some wasted chances.\n\nSure enough, just before the hour flanker Ardie Savea nipped in to touch down when England\u2019s otherwise impressive lineout was caught dozing, and Richie Mo\u2019unga converted. So much for all the play and all the pressure.\n\nEnter that man Ford. Taking over the kicking from a limping Farrell, he ended up slotting four penalties for 12 points while New Zealand failed to add to their tally, and England eased to the finish line.\n\nThis New Zealand performance was ultimately characterised by poor discipline, moments of anger and some hot-headed decisions. Understandable, perhaps. The All Blacks are not used to losing.\n\nBut there was nothing even their inventive play could do to prevent being smothered by England\u2019s white blanket.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nFor the All Blacks it will be time for reflection and rebuilding, while England reach their fourth World Cup final and first since 2007.\n\nThey will meet either Wales or South Africa in the Nov. 2 showpiece, seeking their second victory after 2003 when they became the first, and to date only, northern hemisphere country to claim rugby\u2019s biggest prize.", "description": "All Blacks?
