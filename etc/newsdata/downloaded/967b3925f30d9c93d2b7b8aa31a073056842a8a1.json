(Photo: NINA PROMMER, EPA-EFE)\n\nAngela Bassett opened up about a harrowing childhood experience where she recalled being sexually assaulted by her mother's boyfriend at the time.\n\nThe \"9-1-1\" actress shared the story during the Rape Foundation\u2019s Brunch on Sunday. Bassett, who was hosting the brunch, told The Hollywood Reporter that she remembers being fondled as a young girl while she was sleeping.\n\n\"Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a complete assault, it was fondling, but it was devastating enough for a child who\u2019s 12 or 13,\" Bassett said. \"And thankfully to have a mother who could tell as soon as light broke that this happened and for her to expel him\u2026. That she heard me, believed me, and did something about it was so empowering for me as a young teen, as a young woman.\"\n\nThe Emmy-nominated actress shared that her mother's actions following the assault reassured her.\n\nMore: Angela Bassett on grossest '9-1-1' emergencies, favorite 'Black Panther' memes\n\nThe actress, who shares teenager twin daughter, Bronwyn, and son, Slater, with her husband Courtney B. Vance, said they're raising their kids to know about consent. According to Variety, she began teaching her twins about boundaries when they were two years old.\n\n\"I started that early because of experiences with friends and I know that they will be in situations one day,\" Bassett said. \"When a girl says no, both to him and to her, she means no. Back up. She has to say come here, kiss me.\"\n\nEric McCormack, who also co-hosted the brunch, shared how he speaks to his 17-year-old about sexual assault in case parents needed some advice.\n\n\"We have a 17-year-old and so the whole idea of consent over the last few years has been a conversation,\u201d McCormack said. \"But in terms of advice, I think the biggest thing I\u2019d have to work on with everybody is self-esteem and being strong enough to say no, to call for help. Nobody has the right to abuse you.\"\n\nIf you need to talk to someone about sexual assault, please call the national sexual assault helpline at 1-800-656-4673.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/10/angela-bassett-shares-devastating-story-sexual-assault/3929188002/", "description": "Angela Basset told The Hollywood Reporter that she remembers being fondled as a young girl while she was sleeping.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
