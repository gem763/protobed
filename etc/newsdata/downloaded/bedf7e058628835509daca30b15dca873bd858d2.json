(AP) - D\u2019Andre Swift is still looking for No. 10 Georgia\u2019s offense to play its first complete game.\n\nHe suggests some changes may be necessary to make that happen.\n\nSwift, the leader of the Bulldogs\u2019 running attack, would like to see the offense be less predictable in Saturday night\u2019s game against Kentucky. He didn\u2019t mince words when asked if he\u2019d like to see more creative play-calling as a way to help the Bulldogs\u2019 running backs create big plays.\n\n\u201cMost definitely,\u201d Swift said Monday. \u201cI think we need to do a better job of getting the ball to the playmakers in space and getting the ball outside a little more.\u201d\n\nGeorgia still leads the Southeastern Conference in rushing after being held about 80 yards below its average in last week\u2019s 20-17 double-overtime loss to South Carolina. There were many runs at the heart of the Gamecocks\u2019 defense. Too many for Swift\u2019s liking.\n\nSwift ran for 113 yards but his longest run was only 14 yards. Coach Kirby Smart says he\u2019d like to see more explosive plays, including from the running game.\n\nGeorgia has excellent big-play potential at running back with Swift, Zamir White, James Cook and Brian Herrien, who missed the Kentucky game with back spasms.\n\nSwift said the best way to take advantage of all that speed in the backfield is to mix in more \u201coutside zone, screens, stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs were held to a season-low 4.0 yards per carry in the loss.\n\nSmart said the production qualified as \u201crush efficiency\u201d by the team\u2019s standards, which include average yards gained on each down. The obvious problem was Georgia\u2019s four turnovers, including quarterback Jake Fromm\u2019s three interceptions.\n\nAsked if he believed Georgia had an efficient running game against South Carolina, Swift said \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise was Georgia\u2019s inability to wear down the South Carolina defense. The Bulldogs\u2019 big offensive line was the biggest reason Georgia outscored its first five opponents 84-17 in the second half.\n\nAfter the loss to South Carolina, Smart said \u201cThey outplayed us up front.\u201d He said he wants his players to learn from the loss.\n\nHe said Georgia\u2019s line has to prove it deserves its billing as perhaps the best in school history.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to talk about that, but they\u2019ve got to do it,\u201d Smart said.\n\nTight end Charlie Woerner said the entire offense must respond to Smart\u2019s challenge.\n\n\u201cA challenge is nice,\u201d Woerner said. \u201cYou definitely want to go out there and continue to prove to our coaches and prove to our fans that we can do what we need to do in the run game, that we can move guys off the ball and create gaps and create holes for our running backs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge and we\u2019ll face the challenge and we\u2019ll get better.\u201d\n\nGeorgia (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) can still make a third straight trip to the SEC championship game if the offense can recover from the turnovers and below-average run production.\n\nIt\u2019s also a challenge for first-year offensive coordinator James Coley. Swift said Coley shouldn\u2019t be blamed for the Bulldogs\u2019 season-low 17 points in the loss.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s done a good job so far,\u201d Swift said.\n\nWoerner said high expectations for the offense can be realized.\n\n\u201cYeah, we have a very talented offense, very big O line, very mature offense,\u201d Woerner said. \u201cWe have a lot of mountain left to climb until we\u2019re at our best. That\u2019s what encouraging about this. We can learn a lot from this loss and continue to get better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://twitter.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "D'Andre Swift is still looking for No. 10 Georgia's offense to play its first complete game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
