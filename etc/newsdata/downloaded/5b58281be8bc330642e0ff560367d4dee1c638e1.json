REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nMore than three years after the United Kingdom voted by 52%-48% in a referendum to leave the European Union, the future of Brexit remains uncertain, with options ranging from a turbulent no-deal exit to abandoning the entire endeavour.\n\nHopes of an deal to ease the transition were stoked when Johnson said the shape of an accord was emerging and European Commission President Juncker said an agreement was possible.\n\nBut EU negotiator Michel Barnier cast doubt on the likelihood of a deal and reaffirmed that the bloc could not agree to London\u2019s demand to remove the Irish \u201cbackstop\u201d, a policy to prevent a return of border controls on the island of Ireland - without a serious alternative.\n\n\u201cI am sure you understand this is unacceptable,\u201d Barnier said during a news conference in Berlin alongside German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.\n\nEU sources said no proper alternative for the border between Northern Ireland, a British province, and Ireland that ensures the integrity of the EU single market and customs union has been proposed yet by London, so no breakthrough is on the cards.\n\nIn a quip about British talk of virtual checks on the border, Barnier said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to inspect a cow with virtual methods.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on current UK thinking, it is difficult to see how we can arrive at a legally operative solution which fulfils all the objectives of the backstop. It is in a very sensitive and difficult phase,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by the current deadline of Oct. 31, with or without a transition deal.\n\nWith the outcome of the marathon Brexit process still mired in doubt, the United Kingdom Supreme Court will rule on Tuesday whether Johnson\u2019s Aug. 28 decision to suspend parliament was unlawful.\n\nBREXIT IN PLAY?\n\nIf its 11 justices rule against the government at 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT) on Tuesday, Johnson could be forced to recall parliament - a step that widens the scope for lawmakers to block his \u201cdo-or-die\u201d Brexit plans, which they fear could see Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party will vote to decide its strategy on Monday, leader Jeremy Corbyn heading for a showdown with the widely pro-EU party membership over whether Labour should endorse a policy of remaining in the bloc.\n\nIreland is crucial to any Brexit solution. Unless the Irish border backstop is removed or amended, Johnson will not be able to win parliamentary approval - but Ireland and the EU are loath to sign a deal without a solution to the frontier.\n\nJohnson has said he wants to secure an amended deal at an EU summit on Oct. 17-18, and that \u201ca large number of the important players\u201d, including Britain, Germany, France and Ireland, are keen to reach an agreement.\n\nBut he says that means a removal of the backstop, which aims to avoid the reimposition of checks along what would be the sole British land border with the EU by having London follow EU rules on trade, state aid, labour and environmental standards.\n\nHe said it was important the United Kingdom \u201cwhole and entire\u201d was able to break away from EU law in future.\n\n\u201cThe problem with ... the current backstop is that it would prevent the UK from diverging over a huge range of industrial standards and others,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may want to regulate differently but clearly there is also a strong incentive to keep goods moving fluidly, and we think we can do both.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas speaks during the budget debate in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament in Berlin, Germany September 11, 2019. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\n\nAn EU diplomat said on Monday that Johnson\u2019s government was sticking to a counter-productive approach imposing \u201cits own, self-made problems on us and demand(ing) that we fix them.\n\n\u201c...Why would we bend our rules for a country that is leaving? Why put ourselves at risk for a third country? Why help smooth their departure at our own cost?\u201d the diplomat said.", "description": "The European Union's Brexit negotiator said on Monday it was difficult to see a way to break the Brexit impasse as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's demand to drop an insurance policy for the Irish border was unacceptable.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432979598&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M18R", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
