We will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes,\" he said.\n\nHe did not specifically respond to a question about whether he heard anything in the call that concerned him or raised red flags.\n\nPompeo on Tuesday objected to a move by the U.S. House of Representatives to obtain depositions from five current and former State Department officials as part of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry, and accused Democrats of bullying and intimidation.\n\nAsked about his concerns, Pompeo said State Department employees had been contacted directly by lawmakers or their staff and told not to talk to the State Department's legal counsel.\n\n\"What we objected to were the demands that deeply violate the fundamental principles of separation of powers,\" he said.\n\n\"There are important constitutional prerogatives that the executive branch has to be present so that we can protect important information so our partners ... can have confidence that the information that they provide the State Department will continue to be protected,\" he said.\n\nPompeo is on a three-day trip to Italy, which will include a private audience with Pope Francis on Thursday and a visit to his ancestral home in the rugged, central Abruzzo region.\n\nHe will then fly on to Montenegro, North Macedonia and Greece. But the trip has been overshadowed by the impeachment inquiry at home.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and two other Democratic committee chairmen issued a statement on Tuesday accusing Pompeo of \"stonewalling\" the inquiry, and said he was a \"fact witness\".
