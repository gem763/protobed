A Manhattan district attorney subpoenaed eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns in September.\n\nDespite promises made during his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump has not released his tax information, making him the first president to fail to do so in nearly 40 years.\n\nConsovoy told judges that New York\u2019s local prosecutors had partisan intentions to embarrass the president when issuing the subpoena. He argued there was precedent to the idea that, while a president is not immune from prosecution in federal court, \u201clocal pressures\u201d on a president may be different.\n\nJudge Denny Chin pushed him on that claim, referencing a statement Trump made in the midst of the 2016 election about the staunch loyalty of his supporters. \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters,\u201d Trump said.\n\nChin asked Consovoy: \u201cWhat\u2019s your view on the Fifth Avenue example? Local authorities couldn\u2019t investigate? They couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think once a president is removed from office, any local authority \u2013 this is not a permanent immunity,\u201d Consovoy said in response.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m talking about while in office. That\u2019s the hypo[thetical]. Nothing could be done? That is your position?\u201d Chin pressed further.\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Consovoy said.\n\nThe case over Trump\u2019s tax returns is likely to make its way up to the supreme court. Trump\u2019s lawyers and New York prosecutors struck a agreement that says if Trump loses Wednesday\u2019s battle in the court of appeals, his lawyers will take no more than 10 days to petition to the supreme court.", "description": "Attorney argues president is immune from \u2018local pressures\u2019 in New York court as Trump seeks to block release of tax returns", "authors": ["Lauren Aratani", "Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cfab5026639b36627a2d9c28d86a7cd573f32e4/0_114_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39550384ac7d07ca8621cf95a24b82cd", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
