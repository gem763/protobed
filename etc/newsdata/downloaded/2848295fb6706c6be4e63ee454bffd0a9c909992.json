REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would meet with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for talks in early October, raising optimism over a possible breakthrough in the prolonged trade war that has been a drag on global growth.\n\nMnuchin also clarified that the Trump administration had requested Chinese officials to cancel the farming trip last Friday. The news on cancellation had caused a sharp pullback in U.S. stocks on the day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that people have become positive on (trade talks), but had taken the cancellation as a sign that the deal was in trouble, and now the administration seems to be suggesting that it\u2019s not,\u201d said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe market seems to be in a pretty tight range, while they await some more concrete news about the China situation.\u201d\n\nTrade-sensitive chipmaker stocks rose, with Micron Technology Inc (MU.O), Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) rising between 0.7% and 1.2% in premarket trading.\n\nEven as trade talks remain the primary focus, investors will also keep a watch on the Conference Board\u2019s U.S. consumer confidence reading for September that is expected to come in at 133.5 from a reading of 135.1 in August. The report is due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT).\n\nThe reading will follow mixed economic data from the United States and dismal manufacturing surveys out of the euro zone on Monday that added to investor apprehensions over slowing global growth.\n\n\u201cMarkets are in this delicate period where investors don\u2019t want too much acceleration because they are concerned that it will put an end to low interest rates but they also don\u2019t want enough slowing to impact corporate profits,\u201d Cherry Lane\u2019s Meckler said.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX came within striking distance of its July all-time high last week after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates and left the door open for further easing. The index is now 1.2% away from that peak.\n\nData due later this week, which includes the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation, will offer insights into U.S. economic health ahead of the third-quarter earnings season and the central bank\u2019s policy meeting in October.\n\nAt 8:25 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 72 points, or 0.27%. S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 9 points, or 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 27.75 points, or 0.35%.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) gained 0.9% after Jefferies assumed coverage with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and said Wall Street \u201cunderestimates\u201d the iPhone maker\u2019s position for the 5G cycle.\n\nVideo streaming platform Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) fell 0.3% after Pivotal Research cut its price target.\n\nNike Inc (NKE.N) rose 0.6%, ahead of the world\u2019s largest sportswear maker\u2019s first-quarter results after the bell.", "description": "U.S. stocks were set to open higher on Tuesday as Washington confirmed that trade negotiations with China would resume in two weeks, easing some uncertainty caused by the cancellation of a planned U.S. farm visit by Chinese delegates last week.", "authors": ["Ambar Warrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433318677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0YF", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
