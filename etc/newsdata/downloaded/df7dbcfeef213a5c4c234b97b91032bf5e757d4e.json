This baby-step agreement could take weeks to iron out,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader in a note.\n\nThe trade war has pressure China\u2019s trade, with its exports to the United States falling 10.7% from a year earlier in dollar terms over January-September, Chinese customs spokesman Li Kuiwen told reporters.\n\nChina\u2019s imports from the United States on the other hand have fallen 26.4% in dollar terms during the first nine months.\n\nChina\u2019s demand for oil remains strong, however, with its September imports reflecting a 10.8% rise from a year earlier as refiners ramped up output amid stable profit margins and solid fuel demand.", "description": "Oil prices eased on Monday as scant details on the first phase of a trade deal between the United States and China undercut last week's optimism over the thaw that helped to lift crude markets by 2%.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440534488&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D00S", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
