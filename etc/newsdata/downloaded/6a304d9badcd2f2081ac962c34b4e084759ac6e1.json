Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate.\n\nThe inflammatory spot showed Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s picture burning while Elizabeth Heng, a Republican activist from California, called AOC \u201cthe face of socialism and ignorance. Does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d\n\nABC allowed this as to run tonight.\n\n\n\nA U.S. Congresswoman being set on fire.#BoycottABC\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/HCW6ilahkg \u2014 Joshua Potash \ud83c\udd98 (@JoshuaPotash) September 13, 2019\n\nHang then compared Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s politics to the ones that spurred the Cambodian genocide, calling socialism \u201cforced obedience, starvation.\n\n\u201cMine is a face of freedom,\u201d she added. \u201cMy skin is not white. I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, nor socialist. I\u2019m a Republican.\u201d\n\nRelated: Democrats square off on trade, gun control, health care in Houston debate: live blog\n\nThe ad was paid for by Heng\u2019s New Faces of GOP PAC, which is dedicated to fighting against \u201cextreme, socialist Democrats\u201d and to \u201celevate the next generation of Republicans.\u201d\n\nAOC responded on Twitter TWTR, -1.23% that, \u201cRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist. Life is weird!\u201d\n\nKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color - that was the pretense.\n\n\n\nWhat you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case. https://t.co/zvp1EB02c5 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nShe also tweeted, \u201cKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2014 that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d\n\nBut many on Twitter were outraged at the violent ad, with #BoycottABC trending on Friday morning, as well as calls to boycott Sinclair Broadcast Group SBGI, -0.53%, the D.C. broadcasting syndicate that aired the controversial advert. Some likened the act to a death threat. Others condemned the depiction of violence against a woman, and a congresswoman at that.\n\nI don\u2019t care who you support, can we all agree the loser last night was @ABC from poor moderating & time distribution, egregiously low substance punditry, and airing ads showing hate & the corrupting power of $ in politics.\n\n\n\nIn 2024 we will do PBS not corporate media #BoycottABC \u2014 Jonathan Munitz \ud83c\udf39\ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udcb0 (@MyLifeIsMunitz) September 13, 2019\n\n2. Just to be clear, this ad where a sitting member of Congress' face (@AOC) is lit on fire didn't just air on the Sinclair station in DC. It also aired on ABC stations in NYC and Houston.\n\n\n\nUnlike the DC ABC station, the NYC & Houston stations are owned & operated by Disney/ABC \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 13, 2019\n\nSetting a picture of a political opponent on fire in a commercial shown on national television.

After candidate Beto O-Rourke said, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15,\u201d a Republican lawmaker from Texas tweeted that his own \u201cAR\u201d is \u201cready for him.\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded to Briscoe Cain that, \u201cThis is a death threat, Representative. Clearly, you shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15\u2014and neither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nRelated: Texas representative tweets Beto O\u2019Rourke that his \u2018AR is ready for you\u2019\n\nAnd in July, the U.S. Border Patrol began investigating a secret Facebook group run by its own agents that had shared graphic, doctored posts of Ocasio-Cortez, including one that showed a smiling President Donald Trump forcing her head toward his crotch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just indicative of the violent culture that we saw\u201d at the border facility that she toured, she said at the time.", "description": "Critics are likening the advert to a death threat against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. .", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR275_AOC_ZG_20190913110002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
