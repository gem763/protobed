The central bank said that had probably cut 0.4% of 2017 economic growth.\n\nIn March this year, the High Court ruled that the section of the law capping rates was unconstitutional and gave parliament a year to amend it.\n\nThe ruling was issued in a case brought by a private citizen challenging the caps. An appeal of the ruling by a consumer group is pending before a higher court.\n\nIn its March ruling, the High Court accused lawmakers of targeting banks with the cap, without considering borrowers\u2019 behaviour. It also said that the terms used in the law, like the definition of interest rates, were ambiguous.\n\nJude Njomo, the ruling party lawmaker who sponsored the initial rate cap law, introduced the amendments that were required by the court, saying they will clarify some concerns raised by the March court ruling.\n\n\u201cWe have done the necessary corrections that are required by law,\u201d he told lawmakers in chamber, adding that the changes also make it clear that penalties for violations will also apply to bank customers as well as lenders.\n\nMost bank loans in Kenya now come with the maximum 13% rate, but before 2016 they oscillated anywhere up to 27%.\n\nAn attempt by the Finance Ministry to remove the cap was blocked by lawmakers in September last year.\n\nA second attempt to repeal the cap by the finance minister, unveiled in June, is currently being considered by parliament.\n\nNjomo\u2019s amendments require a third and final reading in parliament before lawmakers vote on them. If they pass the amendments, they will be presented to the president for assent.\n\n\u201cThe main reason for this amendment is to bring clarity and is actually a technical issue,\u201d lawmaker John Mbadi said during Wednesday\u2019s debate. \u201cThe only thing that the court did was to ask parliament to clarify some ambiguities.\u201d", "description": "Kenyan lawmakers on Tuesday debated changes to a law capping commercial interest rates after the High Court gave parliament an ultimatum to alter the law to comply with the constitution.", "authors": ["George Obulutsa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
