They don't believe in the way I choose to live my life, basically.\n\n'So it has been quite difficult. Having to tell my parents was really difficult because I care a lot about them so it was something I put off for a long, long time.\n\n'But as I have got older, I have seen sense and realised that it is not about that, it is about being yourself and living life properly. My parents love me: there is no questioning that.\n\nSciver reaches her 50 and is congratulated by Brunt during the Women's World Cup between England and India at Lord's Cricket Ground in North London\n\nBrunt poses for a selfie with team-mates after winning the Women's World Cup in July 2017\n\n'They will always be there for me and support me.
