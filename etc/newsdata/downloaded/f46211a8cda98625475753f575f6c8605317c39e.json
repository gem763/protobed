At the time, however, Mr Biden was taking part in what was an international consensus between the Obama administration and several western allies that Mr Shokin needed to be removed because he was slowing down anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mr Sondland was reportedly instructed by Mr Trump to take a lead role in relations between the US and Ukraine, and Democrats see him as a key witness to what happened between the two countries leading up to the president's July phone call with Ukraine's leader, in which he asked for an investigation into Mr Biden.\n\nIn response to that snub, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said that the State Department is withholding messages that are deemed relevant to the impeachment enquiry. He also warned that by blocking Mr Sondland's testimony, the White House was participating in obstruction of the committees' investigation.\n\n\"Not only is the Congress being deprived of his testimony, and the American people are being deprived of his testimony today, but we are also aware that the ambassador has text messages or emails on a personal device which have been provided to the State Department,\" Mr Schiff said.\n\nHe continued: \"Although we have requested those from the ambassador and the State Department is withholding those messages as well. Those messages are also deeply relevant to this investigation and the impeachment enquiry.\"\n\nMr Trump also weighed in, claiming that he would like Mr Sondland to be allowed to testify \u2014 but casting the House investigation as illegitimate.\n\n\"I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify,\" Mr Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, \"but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away.\"", "description": "Lindsey Graham has invited Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani,\u00a0to testify before the Senate, citing an interest in providing a counterweight to\u00a0the impeachment inquiry being run by House Democrats.", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/11/Giuliani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
