Chief Gerke said he had worked at Journey Oilfield Services.\n\nThere is as yet not thought to be any link to domestic or international terrorism.\n\nPolice pulled over the gunman's vehicle shortly after 15:00 local time (20:00 GMT) between the cities of Midland and Odessa after the car did not indicate a left turn.\n\nThe shooter then fired at the officers before driving towards Odessa. He shot at random, targeting motorists and passers-by, before officers killed him outside a cinema.\n\nAt least 22 people were wounded, including 17-month-old girl Anderson Davis. A family friend told Buzzfeed News the child \"has a hole in her bottom lip, a hole in her tongue, and her top and bottom teeth were knocked out\".\n\nGreg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, tweeted that the suspect \"had previously failed a gun purchase background check\" in the state.\n\n\"We must keep guns out of criminals' hands,\" he wrote.\n\nNon-profit research group Gun Violence Archive says nearly 10,000 people have died in US shootings this year.", "description": "The gunman in Saturday's mass shooting had just been fired before the attack.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/184B5/production/_108590599_056198666.jpg"}
