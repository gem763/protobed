One opened the curtain, and then suddenly there were four [doctors and nurses],' he said.\n\n'I had a friend there and they asked if they should go - between that and the doctors I thought it was something serious.'\n\nHe was told he didn't need surgery as the morphine he was on had untwisted the spermatic cord - but he suffered the same injury months later and was told he needed surgery or he might lose a testicle\n\nHe was told he had suffered a testicular torsion, which is when the spermatic cord becomes twisted and stops the blood flow to the testicles.\n\nThe morphine had untwisted the cord and the doctor then checked to make sure everything was OK.\n\n'I thought, \"Why is there a viewing room for this\",' he said.\n\nWHAT IS TESTICULAR TORSION Testicular torsion is when the spermatic cord becomes twisted and stops the blood flow to the testicles. The ailment requires immediate surgery as it could cause permanent damage or the person could lose their testicle. Symptoms include: Nausea\n\nBelly pain\n\nVomiting\n\nSwelling\n\nOne testicle is higher than the other If you suspect you have a testicular torsion you should seek medical help immediately. They can be diagnosed through ultrasound or blood and urine tests. Men who have the surgery are required bed rest, skipping strenuous activities such as sports or sexual intercourse. Even men who lose a testicle are likely to be able to father children later in life.

He said the pain was similar to repeatedly being hit in the groin with a cricket ball.\n\n'They said I was lucky the first time as I was at risk of losing one of my testicles,' he said, but added that the whole situation was 'kind of funny'.\n\n'When you go to hospital for a knee reconstruction or a broken arm, that's a bit boring,' he said.\n\n'I had a friend tell me that they felt bad for me but they couldn't stop laughing.'\n\nThe comedian is keen to find a way to work what happened to him into his comedy repertoire\n\nMr Lyons said he feels better now, but is still in quite a bit of pain.\n\n'They put me on the strong painkillers, and I laid down on the couch for two weeks catching up on Netflix and playing PlayStation, which was nice to just take a break without guilt,' he said.\n\nHe said he still isn't able to swim, which he typically does daily, and was banned from having sex for six weeks.\n\nOne of his biggest disappointments was having to cancel his shows for the Sydney Fringe Festival, as he could barely walk.\n\nMr Lyons is gearing up for some television projects in the next few months, as well as touring with his show\n\n'The surgery is supposed to stop it from ever happening again, I hope when I am 50 it doesn't pop up again,' he said.\n\nHowever the comedian is keen to find a way to work what happened to him into his comedy repertoire.\n\n'I haven't thought of a funny enough joke yet - I think the pain is still fresh,' he said.\n\n'It would ridiculous if I couldn't come up with one joke out of the whole ordeal.'\n\nMr Lyons is gearing up for some television projects in the next few months, as well as touring with his show.", "description": "Ciaran Lyons, 22, was performing at the Melbourne Comedy Festival in April, 2019, when he suffered his first testicular torsion - another injury months later required surgery.", "authors": ["Claudia Poposki For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/05/19523108-0-image-a-45_1570681154188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
