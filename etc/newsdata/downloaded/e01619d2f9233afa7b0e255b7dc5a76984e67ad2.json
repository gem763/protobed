The slippery nature of the concept spurred Gerald Ford\u2019s famous declaration in 1970 that \u201can impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d That\u2019s true, but which offenses should Congress consider impeachable? The debate over how to answer that question revolves around a couple of hypotheticals:\n\nA crime that\u2019s not an impeachable offense?\n\n\u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose voters,\u201d Mr. Trump famously said at a campaign rally during the 2016 presidential race. As it happens, an imagined scenario in which the president commits murder was raised as far back as 1789. Michael Stern, former senior counsel to the House of Representatives, writes that \u201cthere is no serious question that our murdering president could be impeached for his crime.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cnot all crimes by federal officials have been seen as impeachable,\u201d write Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard, and Joshua Matz, an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law, in their book \u201cTo End a Presidency.\u201d So where exactly does the line fall? During Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, Mr. Tribe argued that his conduct did not rise to the level of an impeachable offense because it related to his private life.\n\nBut Michael Stokes Paulsen, a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas, disagrees, claiming the distinction is contrived: \u201cPerjury and obstruction of justice are serious felonies (even if somehow cast as \u2018private-capacity\u2019 wrongs),\u201d he writes. \u201cThey are not quite like gunning down a man, but they are serious wrongs against the public and the administration of justice.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the line between an offense that\u2019s impeachable and one that\u2019s merely illegal remains just as obscure as it was during Clinton\u2019s trial. In the words of the Congressional Research Service\u2019s Constitution Annotated:\n\nThere appeared to be broad consensus in the Senate that some private crimes not involving an abuse of power (e.g., murder for personal reasons) are so outrageous as to constitute grounds for removal, but there was no consensus on where the threshold for outrageousness lies.\n\nAn impeachable offense that\u2019s not a crime?\n\nIn 1974, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s second article of impeachment against Richard Nixon alleged an abuse of power in his Watergate cover-up, a political judgment with a legal foundation. (Nixon resigned before his impeachment could be formalized.) In the case of Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine call, some argue that his conduct amounted to an abuse of power that likewise violated both the Constitution and criminal law. Leah Litman, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, wrote for NBC News:\n\nTrump sought to use the extensive powers of his office to get a foreign government to open an investigation that would be damaging to a political rival. \u2026 Using the office of the president for personal political benefit comports with both the standard understandings of bribery and the broader category of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nMany caution that without an underlying criminal offense, like bribery, impeachment risks becoming a partisan political weapon.\n\nThe argument against this sort of ad hoc impeachment has its roots in Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Curtis\u2019s defense of President Andrew Johnson during his impeachment trial in 1868. As Nikolas Bowie, an assistant professor at Harvard Law School, writes in the Harvard Law Review, Curtis believed that retroactively criminalizing a president\u2019s behavior \u2014 inflammatory, racist campaign speeches \u2014 would violate a fundamental principle of common law: \u201cThere must be some law,\u201d Curtis argued, \u201cotherwise there is no crime.\u201d\n\nMr. Bowie argues that the decision to impeach Mr. Trump without any statutory justification would set a dangerous precedent that \u201cwould apply not just to someone as unpopular as President Trump but also to future Presidents whose policies happen to misalign with a congressional majority.\u201d", "description": "Only two presidents have ever been put on trial.
