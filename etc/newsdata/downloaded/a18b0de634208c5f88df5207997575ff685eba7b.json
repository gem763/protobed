It\u2019s in my words and expresses my thoughts. It describes how I feel and what\u2019s happened in my life. I\u2019ve been working at it steadily, and I\u2019m looking forward to continuing the process and creating a book that people will want to read.\u201d\n\nWoods\u2019 editor at HarperCollins, Shannon Welch, said she was \u201cdelighted to discover how much he has to say, and how ready, how eager, he is to say it. He\u2019s at a place in his career and his life where he\u2019s thinking deeply about his story, the highs and the lows, and how it all relates and connects. I think the result will be extraordinary.\u201d\n\nLast year, the biography Tiger Woods was released, written by the journalists Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian. The pair conducted interviews with more than 250 people in Woods\u2019 life, but not the man himself, after he reportedly set strict conditions on their meetings.\n\nThe New York Times called the biography \u201cexhilarating, depressing, tawdry and moving in almost equal measure\u201d, adding: \u201cIf you stripped most of the golf out of this book, you might sometimes think you are reading the biography of a sociopath, a non-murderous Tom Ripley or Patrick Bateman, or Svidrigailov from Crime and Punishment.\u201d", "description": "Publisher HarperCollins says Back is first and only account \u2018directly from\u2019 US golfer", "authors": ["Sian Cain", "Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee1e83a6e8020469ce0273f047f1638385ffb08f/0_192_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f2cdfad76826996d36929667967f318a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
