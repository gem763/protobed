If I was cutting my child\u2019s hair because people were being negative, that would be very worrying.\u2019\n\n\u2018He had it cut because he saw a picture of short hair that was all different colours \u2013 red, yellow, blue, whatever \u2013 and he wanted it to look like that. He thought it would change colour, obviously it didn\u2019t \u2013 but he still loves the hair so it\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharley recently spoke about how she feels towards those who criticise her parenting skills on social media. Speaking to OK! magazine, she said: \u2018Mainly I just block it out. I\u2019m not really interested in what anyone else thinks. Everyone parents differently.\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019re in the public eye people think they\u2019ve got a right to say things to you. They don\u2019t!\u2019\n\n\u2018These people comment just to get a response. I find that so bizarre and I don\u2019t respond. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s life is perfect but we\u2019re all just doing our best as parents.\u2019\n\nCharley recently welcomed her third child with co-star Matthew Wolfenden \u2014 who plays David Metcalfe in the ITV soap \u2014 and is also mum to Buster, 9. The actress is currently on maternity leave, and thus Debbie has been written out of Emmerdale, with the character currently tending to a new business venture up in Scotland.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Charley took to Instagram in order to put an end to those comments, dismissing the idea that trolls were the reason why her son cut his hair.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Debbie-bids-farewell-to-Cain-in-Emmerdale-6ebd_1571319432.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
