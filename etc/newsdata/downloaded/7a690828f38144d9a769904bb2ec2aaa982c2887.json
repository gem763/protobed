But the fragility that has undermined their season so far returned as they capitulated in alarming fashion.\n\nIt was the first time Tottenham have shipped seven goals at home in any major competition and they became the first English club to concede seven in Europe since they themselves lost 8-0 to FC Cologne in the now-defunct UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1995.\n\nTo add insult to injury for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s shell-shocked side it was a Gnabry, a former Arsenal misfit who managed one goal in a handful of appearances, who was their chief tormentor with a sensational display.\n\nWhile Tottenham\u2019s season continues to misfire, Niko Kovac\u2019s Bayern appear to be going from strength to strength.\n\nIt was not quite the Bavarians\u2019 biggest away win in Europe \u2014 they won 7-1 at Roma in 2014 \u2014 but to do it against a side who reached last year\u2019s final sent out a powerful message.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like (a) 7-2 (match) after 30 minutes. We had our problems at the back and (Manuel) Neuer kept us in the game with some class saves,\u201d Kovac told reporters.\n\n\u201cAfter that, we were much better. We scored at the right time. Getting the second before the break was key.\u201d\n\nPochettino has enjoyed unforgettable European nights as Tottenham manager but this will go down as one of his lowest moments since he took charge in 2014.\n\n\u201cBayern were clinical and scored with every single touch,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is tough to accept but we need to move on. We need to be strong and keep going, stay together...not to find guilt or try to escape. It is the only way to recover.\u201d\n\nBayern lead the group with six points with Red Star Belgrade on three after beating Olympiakos who are level with Tottenham on one point after their 2-2 draw on matchday one.\n\nChances flowed like the rain in a rip-roaring start to the first clash between the sides for 35 years.\n\nGnabry stung the finger of Hugo Lloris inside two minutes before Son was twice denied by Neuer after being played in one-on-one by Tanguy Ndombele.\n\nWhen Bayern gifted possession to Tottenham in the 12th minute, Ndombele found Son again and this time the South Korean beat Neuer with a powerful angled drive.\n\nTottenham\u2019s inability to hold a lead has been a feature this season and within three minutes Bayern were level thanks to a precision effort from distance by Joshua Kimmich.\n\nHarry Kane had an effort cleared off the line soon after but they were pole-axed by three Bayern goals in a 10-minute spell.\n\nLewandowski has already bagged 10 goals in six Bundesliga games this season and his hot streak continued seconds before the interval as he turned and fired home from the edge of the area after Tottenham had failed to clear the ball.\n\nIt was harsh on Tottenham but things only got worse.\n\nGnabry shredded Tottenham\u2019s defence in the 53rd minute with a jet-heeled burst down the left before cutting in to arrow a shot past Lloris and he struck again two minutes later.\n\nKane\u2019s penalty restored some hope for Tottenham on the hour after Danny Rose was adjudged to have been fouled and substitute Christian Eriksen forced a fingertip save by Neuer.\n\nBut when Gnabry completed his hat-trick in the 83rd minute, racing on to Thiago Alcantara\u2019s long ball before sliding a cool finish past Lloris, the home fans flooded towards exits.\n\nWith Bayern\u2019s fans joyfully singing \u201cfootball\u2019s coming home\u201d Lewandowski scored a brilliant second from Philippe Coutinho\u2019s pass \u2014 taking his Champions League haul to 56 in 106 games.\n\nTottenham\u2019s defence went AWOL again as Gnabry put Bayern in seventh heaven with his fourth.", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur suffered their heaviest home defeat in Europe as Serge Gnabry struck four goals for Bayern Munich in a 7-2 romp to seize control of Champions League Group B on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436171077&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910IC-OZASP"}
