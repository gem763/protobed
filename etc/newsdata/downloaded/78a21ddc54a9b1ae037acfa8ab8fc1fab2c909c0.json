It included Nate Karns as an opener sandwiched between Andrew Cashner and Dylan Bundy.\n\nThe term opener spread throughout baseball thanks to the Tampa Bay Rays and Oakland Athletics, who commonly used a reliever for a game\u2019s first inning or two before a pitcher more often used as a starter handled the bulk of a game.\n\nBut the Orioles never truly used the method this season. Although Karns was coined an opener, he was instead the first of a series of short-usage pitchers in a what would more accurately be described as a bullpen game.\n\nIn Baltimore\u2019s 5-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners at Camden Yards, the Orioles showed the benefits of using an opener when executed properly. Opener Richard Bleier and bulk man Aaron Brooks combined to cover all nine innings, with Brooks following Bleier with seven one-hit innings.\n\n\u201cThat was the best we\u2019ve seen Brooksy all year,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cIt was three pitches for strikes, really in control the entire time, gave up one hit, one walk in seven innings. Pitched ahead in the count. Got some big strikeouts. Just had a lot of composure tonight.\u201d\n\nMaking his first major league start after 159 career relief appearances, Bleier got two quick outs in the first before yielding a two-run home run.\n\nBut Bleier retired four of the next five Mariners before giving way to Brooks, who had started in his first 12 outings for the Orioles but posted a 14.25 first-inning ERA. Not pitching in the first led to one of Brooks\u2019s best performances with Baltimore. He allowed just one run in seven innings.", "description": "Baltimore beat the Mariners, 5-3, while employing a new-age baseball strategy.", "authors": ["Nathan Ruiz", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/318ROIlGYw9XgSDaTkZy2IroDhk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5O5XZ6G4EUI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
