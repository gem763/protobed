The coworking company delayed its public offering amid investor uncertainty around the company's finances, its unusual governance structure and potential conflicts of interest with Neumann's other business interests.\n\nJPMorgan is leading the listing, which would occur in October at the earliest because of the delay. WeWork was initially planning to list in September.\n\nBut JP Morgan also has a long history with WeWork and with Neumann. A JP Morgan fund bought a stake in the company five years ago. The bank helped Neumann when he wanted to borrow money against some of his stock. And Neumann has also borrowed almost $40 million in mortgages from the bank, Bloomberg's Sonali Basak reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Neumann is under siege by his board of directors and investors, according to several reports. The board convened on Monday to discuss whether or not to oust Neumann, reports said, but it wasn't clear where the group landed at the end of the day.", "description": "The Vanity Fair report comes amid revelations that Neumann and Dimon met over the weekend to try and get WeWork's IPO back on track.", "authors": ["Megan Hernbroth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c0e92c51486fd5389141682?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
