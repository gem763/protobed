Some have called for the resignation of the president, who has declared a two-month national emergency.\n\nMr Moreno said the curfew would take effect on Saturday at 15:00 (20:00 GMT).\n\n\"I've ordered the joint command of the armed forces to immediately take steps necessary to re-establish order in all of Ecuador,\" he said.\n\nThe armed forces said movement would be restricted across the country for 24 hours.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Police have fired tear gas to try to disperse angry crowds\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Women's groups marched through Quito demanding a peaceful solution to the crisis\n\nMr Moreno also thanked indigenous leaders for agreeing to hold direct talks. Members of the the indigenous umbrella group CONAIE had previously rejected calls for the talks but agreed on the condition that be broadcast and not held behind closed doors.\n\nIt is not clear if demonstrators will observe the curfew.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, protesters attacked a television station and newspaper office in Quito. The Teleamazonas channel broadcast pictures of its broken windows and a burning vehicle. El Comercio newspaper tweeted that a \"group of unknowns\" had attacked its offices. No injuries were reported in either incident.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption TV station Teleamazonas was targeted by protesters\n\nElsewhere, masked men threw petrol bombs at a government building in Quito housing the comptroller general's office and then overran it.\n\nOn Twitter, Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said the area around the building was being evacuated so fire crews could put out the flames. She said 30 people had been arrested outside the building.\n\nWhat's the background?\n\nProtests began after the government announced an end to fuel subsidies as part of public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in return for a loan. The deal reached in March will allow Ecuador to borrow $4.2bn (\u00a33.4bn).\n\nMr Moreno has said the fuel subsidies, introduced in the 1970s with an annual cost of $1.3bn, were no longer affordable. Eliminating them is part of his plan to shore up Ecuador's flagging economy and ease its debt burden.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Protesters in Quito chant: \"Women united will never be defeated!\"\n\nPetrol prices soared and thousands took to the streets. In recent days, they set up barricades, stormed buildings and clashed with security forces, who have tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas.\n\nProtesters have also entered some oil fields, affecting production in the Andean nation, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nIndigenous-led protests have toppled three presidents in the past few decades. Since the current unrest began, protesters have taken dozens of officers hostage in various locations throughout the country .", "description": "President Moreno vows to restore order just hours after protest leaders agree to talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qxkxq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
