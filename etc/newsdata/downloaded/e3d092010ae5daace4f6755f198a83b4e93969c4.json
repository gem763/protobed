Hospitals back home quoted him cash prices of over $30,000.\n\nThen he went online and found the Surgery Center of Oklahoma's cash price: just over $3,000.\n\n\"It's like [the] a la carte menu at a Mexican restaurant,\" Schlieper said, laughing. \"It's great. What do you want? That's how much it costs.\"\n\nClick here to share your story and search prices\n\nAnesthesiologist Keith Smith runs the center but they only perform certain outpatient procedures \u2014 like knee or gall bladder surgeries \u2014 and they don't take insurance.\n\n\"Patients are quoted anywhere from six to 10 times what we have listed online,\" Smith said of other facilities.\n\n\"We basically take in control of the institutional part and whittle that down to a razor-thin profit margin.\"\n\nAround the country, middle-class Americans with high-deductible insurance plans are heading to dozens of cash-based surgery centers like this one.\n\nBut New York University health economist Sherry Glied says not everyone can pay cash and this won't solve the system's larger problems.\n\n\"I laud people for wanting to try and find workarounds to the system,\" Glied said. \"But I think what this story really tells us is how outrageously variable everything in U.S. health care really is.\"\n\nSchlieper says there's a lesson here: \"Why can't we just know what it costs? ...Transparency would be great.\"\n\nIn our series, \"Medical Price Roulette,\" CBS News is collaborating with journalists at ClearHealthCosts to bring transparency to health care markets.
