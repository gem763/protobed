Pompeo said \u201cabsolutely, 100 percent,\u201d adding that he also wanted to attend the wedding of his son\u2019s best friend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPompeo declined to answer questions about the impeachment inquiry, and when asked whether the treatment of Kurdish allies in Syria had \u201cundercut U.S. credibility,\u201d he shot back \u2014 \u201cthe whole predicate of your question is insane.\u201d\n\nPompeo, 55, came home to a state that will probably remain resolutely red in next year\u2019s presidential election, where locals are expressing \u201ca lot of frustration\u201d with the Democratic impeachment inquiry in Washington, said Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kan.), who appeared with Pompeo at the event.\n\n\u201cThere are just so many other things we need to do,\u201d Estes said.\n\nDespite Pompeo\u2019s repeated attempts to tamp down speculation on a possible Senate bid \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s off the table\u201d he said in August \u2014 he has sometimes couched his denials in vague enough terms to suggest he is trying to keep his options open.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said Thursday that there had been \u201cno change\u201d in his thinking. His \u201cmission\u201d is \u201cto \u00adexecute American diplomacy, to make sure that American markets are open for Kansas products all around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. And it\u2019s what I continue, intend to continue to be focused on.\u201d\n\nIt was his fourth trip to the state this year, and \u201cthe timing is eyebrow-raising,\u201d said Brandon Woodard, a Democratic state legislator from the Kansas City area.\n\nPompeo, who previously served as CIA director under Trump, arrived at the State Department last spring promising to restore \u201cswagger\u201d to beleaguered diplomats, who had felt shut out of policymaking under his predecessor, Rex Tillerson.\n\nAD\n\nBut as House committees conduct an impeachment inquiry of Trump, testimony from a succession of State Department witnesses has laid bare the growing level of discontent with Pompeo\u2019s stewardship of the agency.\n\nAD\n\nTestimony by a number of State Department officials and \u00adex-employees has raised even more questions about how much Pompeo knew about the Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate his chief political rival, former vice president Joe Biden. Pompeo has said he will not speak publicly about private conversations.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done everything possible to keep his head down during this Ukraine stuff,\u201d said a former diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid. \u201cHe almost certainly will run for the Senate in Kansas. So he wants to be sure he has the complete and vocal backing of the president. This Ukraine thing, this \u00adGod-awful mess, could cause him a problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAround the State Department, it is widely believed that Pompeo is still mulling his candidacy. But it is uncertain what impact the House impeachment inquiry will have on his chances among Kansas voters.\n\nAD\n\nThe impeachment inquiry \u201chasn\u2019t fundamentally changed anything on the ground in regard to Pompeo,\u201d said Russell Arben Fox, a political science professor at Friends University in Wichita. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort of Republican Republicans really like. He has this reputation for being smart and stable and conservative \u2014 but not weird. And he could straddle the fence \u2014 appease both moderate and more conservative factions of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nRepublican leadership \u2014 including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u2014 has been urging Pompeo to consider running since Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) announced earlier this year he would be retiring.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe field is just very unsettled and Kansas Republicans are anxious for a clear conservative leader \u2014 Secretary Pompeo is where everyone wants to be,\u201d said Jared Suhn, a political consultant who previously worked for Roberts.\n\nAD\n\nThough Kansas has a late \u00adprimary-filing deadline of June 1, Pompeo could not realistically postpone a decision until then and keep other Republican potential candidates waiting for him to make up his mind, analysts said. The establishment front-runner, Rep. Roger Marshall, the Republican in western Kansas, already has nearly $2 million on hand.\n\nRepublican leaders are particularly concerned about the candidacy of Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who lost the governor\u2019s race to Democrat Laura Kelly last year. Kobach\u2019s anti-immigrant views and penchant for Trumpian grandstanding could turn off some moderate voters if he prevailed in the primary, analysts say.\n\nAD\n\nKobach, \u201chas been a polarizing figure,\u201d said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid he could put a Senate seat in play when the seat should be safely Republican.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRumors about Pompeo\u2019s ambitions have been stoked in part by a string of interviews he has given to Kansas media and his frequent trips home to the state, where he spent over a decade as a businessman and forged ties to conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. He has maintained his Kansas connections in other ways, such as appearing at the annual dinner of the Kansas Society of Washington this summer and meeting with the Kansas contingent at a Veterans of Foreign Wars conference in Orlando.\n\nAnalysts say if he doesn\u2019t run next year he may eye a Senate race in 2020 or even presidential bid in the future, with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that also includes the U.S. Military Academy, a stint in the Army and Harvard Law School.\n\nAD\n\nPompeo\u2019s leadership at the State Department has come under fire since diplomats have testified about their concern over efforts by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to get Ukrainians to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. William Taylor, who Pompeo pulled back from retirement to become the head of the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, said he wrote a cable to Pompeo saying the efforts at \u201cunofficial\u201d diplomacy were \u201cfolly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis week alone, at least four groups of former diplomats from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development have written open letters and issued statements expressing their disappointment that Pompeo has not defended diplomats from being mistreated. Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly recalled as the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, has become a hero of the diplomatic corps.\n\n\u201cWe have been inspired by the leadership these diplomats have shown, despite President Trump\u2019s and Secretary Pompeo\u2019s efforts to silence them,\u201d Foreign Policy for America, a group led by former diplomats, said a statement issued Wednesday.\n\nMany current employees say they share the sentiments but could not sign their names for fear of being fired. Morale has plummeted as many employees say they believe Pompeo has failed to publicly defend the diplomats who have testified despite his order not to and Trump\u2019s dismissal of them as \u201cradical\u201d bureaucrats of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The secretary of state returned to his adopted hometown, declining to answer questions about the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.", "authors": ["Annie Gowen", "National Correspondent", "Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fKqdIH4VfhCjqrh-YngumfljyzY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QNZ6D2HWPII6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
