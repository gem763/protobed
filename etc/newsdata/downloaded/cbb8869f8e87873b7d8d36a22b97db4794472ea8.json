First, he has to get elected as Student Body President at his Santa Barbara High School against Lucy Boynton's similarly ruthless Astrid - and high jinx and near death ensues.\n\nThough ridiculously wealthy and overly-indulged by her much older husband, Georgina has a streak of self-awareness and tongue-in-cheek charm.\n\nPaltrow's husband Brad Falchuk co-wrote the series with Murphy, but she admits that she initially told him 'no' to the part because she was too busy with her luxury lifestyle brand Goop, which is the subject of a Netflix series set for release next year.\n\n\"Brad said, 'You're my muse for this character,' and I was like, 'Oh, that's very nice,'\" she added to THR. \"I just was like, 'I can't do any projects right now. I have an immense amount of responsibility at my company.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Courtesy of NETFLIX More\n\nBut she eventually relented, adding: \"When you fully commit to somebody as your life partner, you want to also commit to their journey and their work. I felt almost like I wanted to fulfil Brad's vision of it.\"\n\nThe Politician is available to stream on Netflix now.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The actress is fabulously wealthy in the new Netflix series", "authors": ["Naomi Gordon"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DdR56e14wPUivkfnn2OgSw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_111/ccf9918e229d87cb512582668948d947", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
