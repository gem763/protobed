If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhen we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nDavid Muir: \"Are you proposing taking away [American's] guns...?\"\n\n\n\nBeto: \"Hell yes.\" pic.twitter.com/wg6VkrI0er \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) September 13, 2019\n\nHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
