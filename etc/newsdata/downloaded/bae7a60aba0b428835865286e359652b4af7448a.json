Being gay is not a fault, being a girl from a modest family is not a fault,\" Lopez told AFP last week.\n\nMore than a third of the 116,000 candidates for mayor, governor and local assembly posts nationwide in Sunday's elections were women.\n\nPresident Ivan Duque lauded the elections for attracting the \"largest number of candidates in history.\"\n\nBut the poll was still beset by violence, according to an independent election monitoring group.\n\nSince nominations closed in the last week of July, seven candidates were assassinated, 88 threatened, 12 targeted in attacks and one abducted, the Electoral Observation Mission said.\n\n- Referendum -\n\nThe vote was largely seen as a referendum on the right-wing Duque and his Democratic Center party, led by his mentor Alvaro Uribe -- the country's leader from 2002-10 who has been embroiled in an investigation over alleged witness tampering.\n\nCoalition candidates opposing Democratic Center dominated Sunday's vote, winning two-thirds of municipal seats according to the Interior Ministry.\n\nDuque made revising the country's 2016 peace deal a centerpiece of his election campaign last year, claiming the agreement was too lenient towards the left-wing former guerrilla movement FARC.\n\nThe insurgent group reorganised itself as a political party after the peace accord and Sunday was the second time it took part in elections.\n\nAfter a dismal showing in last year's legislative elections, the ex-insurgents won a majority in only one municipal government in Colombia's southwest.\n\nIn the country's north, former guerrilla Guillermo Torres -- known as the \"FARC singer\" for his performances of traditional Colombian \"vallenato\" folk music -- won the mayoralty of Bolivar department for a left-wing coalition.", "description": "Claudia Lopez, a symbol of the fight against corruption in Colombia, became the first woman to be elected mayor of Bogota on Sunday.
