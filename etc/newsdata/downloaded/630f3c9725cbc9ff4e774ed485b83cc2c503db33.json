But the honest study of history is not about making you feel good. Take the case of the second world war and how, 80 years after the invasion of Poland, a dispute in Gda\u0144sk over a museum about the war is playing out.\n\nThe populists in Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party have meddled so much in redrafting the narrative conveyed both by the museum and its main exhibition that four Polish historians involved with the institution\u2019s creation and launch have been left with little choice but to go to court.\n\nPopulists care little about the complexities and even less about acknowledging dark chapters of Poland\u2019s collective past\n\nThe courts are hardly the best place to adjudicate on the lessons of history. Universities, academies, libraries and museums are surely more suited to such debates. So let me explain how things got to this point.\n\nThe Gda\u0144sk Museum of the Second World War opened in 2017 to some fanfare; its distinguishing and unconventional features were to be its special focus both on the global context of the war and on the fate of civilians in the bloody conflict. The main exhibition took eight years to put together. The American historian Timothy Snyder called the project a \u201ccivilisational achievement\u201d and \u201cperhaps the most ambitious museum devoted to the second world war in any country\u201d.\n\nBut the populists who had come to power in Poland\u2019s elections two years earlier found this unbearable, preferring to promote a version of events that would airbrush real history and glorify the nation instead. Soon enough the minister of culture and national heritage, Piotr Gli\u0144ski, dismissed the Gda\u0144sk museum director, Pawe\u0142 Machcewicz . A new director, Karol Nawrocki, was duly installed who set about altering the main exhibition \u2013 without consulting its authors. The revised approach was to tack closely to government guidelines giving emphasis to a glorification of Polish military actions and to cast Poland as a righteous nation: the museum would be a monument to national martyrology.\n\nNawrocki, for example, replaced a filmed summary of civilians\u2019 experiences in the war with another film altogether, in which the soundtrack includes claims that can only be described as propaganda, with phrases such as: \u201cwe saved Jews\u201d; \u201cwe give life in the name of dignity and freedom\u201d; \u201cwe were betrayed\u201d; \u201cthe pope gave hope of victory\u201d; \u201ccommunists lose\u201d; \u201cwe won\u201d and \u201cwe do not beg for freedom, we fight for it\u201d.\n\nThis is Europe: stay close with the Guardian\u2019s email updates Read more\n\nThis is populist history. Populist historians tell people \u2013 especially those who have voted for them \u2013 what they want to hear about the past. Remembering the war is a zero-sum game to them: it\u2019s about winners and losers. They care little about the complexities and even less about acknowledging dark chapters of Poland\u2019s collective past. What have we really learned from the past? Old photos of a completely destroyed Warsaw reminded me of news images of other cities, such as Aleppo, that have in more recent times experienced the full brutality of a military onslaught. All the more reason to be reminded of what went before us and of those caught up in the horror.\n\nBut for populist historians \u2013 and not only in Poland \u2013 history is not about learning lessons; it is either a plaything to salve national complexes or a weapon to use in foreign policy (for example, in Polish-Ukrainian or Polish-Israeli relations).\n\nMachcewicz along with the museum\u2019s other founding historians, Janusz Marszalec, Rafa\u0142 Wnuk and Piotr M Majewski, responded to all this with a loud \u201cno\u201d. They have sued the new director of the museum over the infringement of their copyright for the exhibition\u2019s content and managed to halt other changes to the museum. I totally agree with Machcewicz, who describes this saga as \u201cPoland\u2019s most important dispute about history in years\u201d.\n\nThe case, which the courts have yet to rule on, is the first of its kind in Poland and probably in Europe. I can\u2019t think of another example of an exhibition mounted by a major museum being censored by a government because it pays too much attention to civilians and because it insufficiently glorifies the nation. It feels more like the standards that would be applied in Putin\u2019s Russia than in a democratic member state of the European Union.\n\nNorway is in denial about the threat of far-right violence | Sindre Bangstad Read more\n\nThe late Leszek Ko\u0142akowski, one of Poland\u2019s greatest philosophers, wrote in his essay, Doctor Faustus: \u201cWe learn about the past to know how to recognise around us those faces touched by its worst legacy.\u201d To me, a young Pole, this surely is the best definition of the point of studying history. It will hardly surprise you that communist censors didn\u2019t let Ko\u0142akowski publish those words. And now, 30 years after the communist regime collapsed in Poland, history is again being manipulated for political motives. It\u2019s as if only one version \u2013 that approved by a rightwing government that has overseen countless acts of democratic backsliding and is seeking re-election next month \u2013 is acceptable. Anyone who sees things differently is deemed a public enemy.\n\nWhen I started looking into the Gda\u0144sk museum dispute as a news story, it felt like a good issue to report \u2013 especially as I had studied history at university and am passionate about it. But gradually it became something more deeply personal; I realised that this was about our collective values. And it should be personal for anyone who cares about pluralism and free debate. This is a battle to safeguard history that\u2019s not written in black and white, nor aimed at serving a political agenda, but history that inspires us to make connections between the past and today\u2019s world. Big words, you might say. But those four historians who are taking on the government have picked a fight that goes far beyond the future of one museum. This has a European meaning. It concerns us all.\n\n\u2022 Estera Flieger is a journalist with Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza", "description": "Thirty years after communism ended, Poland\u2019s past is again being manipulated for political motives, says Polish journalist Estera Flieger", "authors": ["Estera Flieger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e92f705ccf85598a023305a26575a6c7f504be3/0_334_3798_2280/master/3798.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ce15b342cdc4c2c32ddff27d6cf5d497", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
