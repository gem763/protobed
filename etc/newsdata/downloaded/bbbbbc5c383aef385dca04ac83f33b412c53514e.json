I put out that video and in no way did I think I would get so much backlash and hate \u2013 and a ton of hate from the LGBTQ+ community.\u2019\n\nThe former Celebrity Big Brother star added: \u2018That alone breaks my heart so much because I would never want to offend that community.\u2019\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t told anyone in my life these feelings\u2026because of the judgement, because of the backlash,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018This is something that I have felt since I was five, six, seven.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecalling that she has been seeing a gender identity therapist for the past few months, Trisha explained: \u2018I would never have said I was transgender before. I said I don\u2019t think I\u2019m non-binary, I really in my heart feel male.\u2019\n\nSobbing, Trisha went on to say: \u2018I feel like I should just apologise so people stop being nasty to me because this is something I\u2019ve really struggled with.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018As a child I hated my breasts, I hated my vagina, I hated going into the female bathroom, I hated being classified as female.\u2019\n\nShe broke down in tears (Picture: YouTube/Trisha Paytas)\n\nDirectly addressing the backlash, she went on to say: \u2018I just don\u2019t get how people think I can choose this, that I\u2019m just deciding to do this,\u2019 before concluding: \u2018I feel part of the [LGBT] community without being part of the community because no one wants me in it.\u2019\n\nIn her original video, Trisha said she intends to continue using female pronouns and her birth name.\n\nShe said: \u2018I identify with men better. People always think there\u2019s something wrong with me because I don\u2019t have that many girlfriends but I do love girls \u2014 I love their sensitivity and all the stuff like that.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s why I identify more as a gay man because I like guys but I also identify as a guy.\u2019\n\nTrisha said she intends to continue using female pronouns (Picture: YouTube)\n\nHowever, viewers were confused when Trisha later said that while she one thousand percent \u2018thinks\u2019 she is transgender, she also \u2018a thousand percent\u2019 identifies with her \u2018natural born gender\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe YouTuber has faced a huge amount of backlash, with one viewer saying: \u2018Trisha it\u2019s not about how you dress it\u2019s literally that you\u2019re 100% okay with your birth gender and you only feel like a guy bc you have guy friends and wanna date gay guys and have short hair you cannot just choose to be trans like that.\u2019\n\nHowever, others have asked for people to show her empathy, with fellow YouTuber Jake Edwards tweeting: \u2018No trans person entered this world with a full understanding of the correct terminology to use. My main issue with the video was the lack of understanding and conflating gender stereotypes with gender identity.\n\n\u2018BUT this should be met with allowing Trisha the space to learn.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
