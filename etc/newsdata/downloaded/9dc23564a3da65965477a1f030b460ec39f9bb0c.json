We already did that.", "language": "en", "text": "At a rally in Louisiana on Friday night, President Donald Trump spoke for nearly 90 minutes.\n\nHe closed the evening by emphatically saying the US would \"defeat Socialism\" and \"put a man on the face of the moon.\"\n\nWe already did that \u2014 50 years ago.\n\nVisit Insider.com for more stories.\n\nOn Friday night, President Donald Trump held a campaign rally at the James E. Sudduth Coliseum in Lake Charles, Louisiana. A nearly full house listened on as Trump covered some of his favorite subjects (the border, the military, and the flag) and attacked all the usual suspects (Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, the state of California).\n\nAnd then things got weird.\n\nAt the end of his 90-minute speech, Trump took a moment to speak on the sanctity of the national motto \"In God We Trust\" before launching into a rousing history lesson on the founding of America.\n\n\"We stand on the shoulders of American patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism,\" Trump said. \"And we're gonna defeat socialism and put a man on the face of the moon.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nHere's the thing; The US already put a man on the moon \u2014 50 years ago. In fact, the photo of Buzz Aldrin planting a flag in the rocky, cratered face of the moon is one of the most recognizable images of the last hundred years (in no small part because it later became part of the station identification for MTV).\n\nNASA actually completed six crewed missions to the moon between 1969 and 1972 \u2014 and a total of 12 astronauts touched down on the moon's \"face.\"\n\nTrump has a history of flubbing up historical moments \u2014 claiming that Federick Douglass (who died in 1895) is \"doing great work,\" and claiming that the US \"took over the airports\" in order to defeat the British in the Revolutionary War (there definitely weren't airports \u2014 or airplanes \u2014 in the late 1770s).\n\nTrump's space policy \u2014 particularly on going back to the moon \u2014 has flip-flopped.\n\nIn June he tweeted, \"For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!\"\n\nHowever, in a speech on the Fourth of July, Trump celebrated the Apollo 11 moon landing, telling Gene Kranz, the Apollo flight director, \"Gene, I want you to know that we're going to be back on the moon very soon, and, someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.\"\n\nBut maybe this is all a big misunderstanding. Maybe Trump meant another moon?", "description": "This isn't the first time Trump has flubbed up history \u2014 or changed course on his policy of going to the moon.", "authors": ["Julie Gerstein"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da14923e94e864d1e7886f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
