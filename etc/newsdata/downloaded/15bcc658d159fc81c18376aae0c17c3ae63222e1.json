There was precious little else to shout about as their team toiled.\n\nPA\n\n7:18PM\n\nGood evening all!\n\nWhat a day of Premier League action we have had today - who needs an international break?\n\nBoth Manchester teams succumbing to Wolves and Newcastle respectively, with Liverpool staying eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.\n\nChelsea's youngsters have pushed themselves up to fifth in the table, while Arsenal's 1-0 win against Bournemouth leaves them just one point behind second-placed Manchester City.\n\n7:11PM\n\nDavid De Gea\n\nDe Gea has apologised to the fans, claiming he doesn't know what's going wrong and admitting these performances are unacceptable.\n\n7:08PM\n\nGary Neville on Sky Sports\n\nThe club need to get the players in the transfer market. The recruitment has been woeful for several years now. They need another centre-back, a right-back, two central midfielders, a wide player and a centre forward. Hopefully they can be supplemented by the talent coming through - there is talent there. These young players need the time to grow organically. The board have cocked this up over many years. The board have cocked this up. Manchester United are getting the pain that they deserve for the poor decisions at board level. There were things that I liked out there today - Tanzuebe and Maguire. The goalkeeper we hope can come back to his best and I like McTominay's spirit. If Man Utd recruit well in these next few windows then they will have the bones of something. But the club has recruited so badly.\n\nCredit: GETTY IMAGES\n\n7:05PM\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer post-match thoughts\n\nWe are in a position that we are not used to. Some of the boys lack a little bit of composure. We don't create enough chances to win a game of football. I't's symptomatic of where are at the moment. We work hard but we don't create. There are some attacking players away of course, but we expect them to come back and fire on all cylinders. [What's the solution?] That's the million-dollar question. We need to evaluate what's gone on during the first 8 games in the international break. I need to sort the heads out - that's the main thing. We have young boys who are maybe lacking confidence who need some help from the senior players and staff. They are human beings, good footballers who really want to do well. They need to see the results of their hard work and we don't at the minute. The first-half was very poor. That was the poorest we've been, we gave so many sloppy balls away. We dominated the second half but we didn't create enough. We have not changed a lot. We have played the same way and stuck to the principles that we have. We don't give away too many chances - but today was a poor goal, our own set-piece and we are counterattacked away from home. We have six of the starting XI out today that started the Chelsea game. That's going to affect results. It will take, however, as long it will have to take [to get back to winning ways]. We have given ourselves a big uphill task to get among the top four - never mind the top 6. It is tight, but we have to get a run together.\n\nCredit: Sky Sports\n\n6:35PM\n\nManchester United's poor form\n\n9 - Manchester United have picked up just nine points from their opening eight Premier League matches this season (W2 D3 L3), their worst start to a league season since 1989-90 (8 points) when they went on to finish 13th.

It seems Carroll caught him, but VAR and Mike Dean agree it was accidental.\n\nFree-kick still to come...De Gea is up...\n\n6:21PM\n\n93 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nLascelles and Schar head away as Man Utd search for an equaliser again. Tuanzebe wins a throw-in for Man Utd, as Fred attempts to find Rashford.\n\nBut Newcastle break up field with Yedlin, who tries to go in on goal, but he's easily dispossessed and Man Utd come back.\n\nWhy not take it into the corner?\n\n6:19PM\n\n91 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nIt's all Man Utd now, as expected, with 11 Newcastle men behind the ball, as expected.\n\nMaguire threads a pass down the line towards James but there it's too heavy and the ball goes out for a goal kick.\n\nOne of four added minutes survived by Newcastle.\n\n6:18PM\n\n88 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nChong fouls Almir\u00f3n after Yedlin intercepts a Man Utd pass. This game is beginning to slip away from Solskjaer's men.\n\nPereira then catches Carroll, giving away another free-kick, and there is some argy-bargy between Matty Longstaff, Fred, and McTominay, but nothing that isn't easily defused by referee Mike Dean.\n\nKrafth replaces Almir\u00f3n, too.\n\n6:14PM\n\n85 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nForu bodies into the box - finally - for Man Utd, but there's not enough venom in the cross so Greenwood's header is meat and drink for Dubravka.\n\nChong's playing down the left and his first job is to chase after a long ball that has far too much on it; it rolls out for a goal kick.\n\nChong is on now for Man Utd as the last roll of the dice.\n\n6:11PM\n\n82 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nPereira has a free-kick in a dangerous position on the edge of Newcastle's box, but it's a terrible strike that doesn't get beyond the wall.\n\nThen Fred loses control near the touchline and Newcastle will have the throw. Not an ideal two minutes for the Brazilian.\n\nSaint-Maximin is off for Newcastle - his job is done. Over to you, now, defence...\n\n6:09PM\n\n80 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nNewcastle with 11 men behind the ball now - it might not be long until Steve Bruce himself is on to defend.\n\nMan Utd look to attack, and approach the Newcastle penalty area but, despite the patient build-up, Fred rashly thrashes a speculative shot well over the bar.\n\n6:06PM\n\n77 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nNewcastle are much more comfortable now, and the stodgy attack play from both teams is now more frantic and end-to-end.\n\nGreenwood and Fred combine intricately at one end before Longstaff Snr has a long-range pop following another Saint-Maximin dribble.\n\nRojo has received a yellow card for a cumbersome challenge - totally needless.\n\n6:03PM\n\n74 min: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nThat goal came completely against the run of play. Man Utd had looked increasingly dominant as this half had gone on, but it was a ruthless counter, with a precise, punchy finish from the younger Longstaff brother.\n\nMan Utd come back and Rojo gets a header at the near post that's two foot away from the top corner.\n\nSt James' Park is buzzing.\n\n6:01PM\n\nGoooooaaaal Longstaff, M: Newcastle 1 Man Utd 0\n\nWhat was I saying? Newcastle counter straight from Man Utd's best period of the game. Saint-Maximin dribbles dangerously at the defence, before finding Willems wide left, he lays the perfect pass to debutant Longstaff on the edge of the area and he makes no mistake. De Gea did not even dive. Emphatic.\n\n6:00PM\n\n71 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nMan Utd's passing has improved, exemplified in James' cross to Rashford.\n\nHe thrashes a ball across the face of goal, and Schar just gets to it before Rashford, who had the goal at his mercy.\n\nMan Utd look like they're turning the screw a little here, and Newcastle might be running out of steam.\n\n5:57PM\n\n69 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nNewcastle are under a bit of pressure here. Maguire finds Pereira in behind Newcastle's back five, and he slots a cross into the area but no one can get on the end of it.\n\nGreenwood has come on for Mata, and he makes an immediate impact, finding Young in front of goal, but the defender's shot is blocked.\n\n5:54PM\n\n66 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nAlmir\u00f3n finds a pocket of space at the centre spot and storms at the Man Utd defence. He launches himself to the ground and there was little to no contact; Newcastle's midfielder receives a yellow card for simulation.\n\n5:53PM\n\n64 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nFred finds Young in space, who links with Pereira but Lascelles shuts the door well. He clears up to Carroll who is then fouled by Rojo - on for Dalot - while trying to hold the ball up.\n\nYedlin breaks down the right before clubbing a cross into the box. Carroll gets on the end of it but his header goes comfortably over the bar.\n\nIt's been a jittery, stuttering, tense half of football thus far.\n\n5:50PM\n\n62 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nYoung heads away Yedlin's header well after a patient attack from Newcastle gives them some territory.\n\nMaguire puts in a long ball towards Mata but it's just a bit too long, and Newcastle head away before McTominay tries to unleash a screamer from 35 yards which, again is well blocked.\n\nThe rumour is that Dalot has gone off injured. Another one for Man Utd to deal with.\n\n5:47PM\n\n59 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nJames attacks down the right, managing to nudge a cross in along the floor to the near post. But there's nobody there for Man Utd and Newcastle get it away - that is Rashford territory.\n\nPereira then flashes another ball into the box, and James is nearly on the end of it, but he can't quite get there.\n\n5:45PM\n\n57 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nBetter from Newcastle as they enter the Man Utd half, Willems and Schar finding teammates with decent passes.\n\nBut Tuanzebe, arguably the best player on the pitch thus far, thwarts any threat and Man Utd clear.\n\n5:43PM\n\n55 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nDalot attempts a cross which is blocked by Newcastle and Young will take a corner for Man Utd.\n\nMaguire gets to it, but not cleanly, and his header and follow-up shot are blocked.\n\nJames tries to whip another cross in towards the far post but Maguire can't get to it.\n\nA big cheer, too, as Andy Carroll comes on for Joelinton. He has never scored against Man Utd.\n\n5:42PM\n\n52 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nTuanzebe puts a good ball in to find James on the right, before a sloppy Man Utd thrown ends with the ball back out of play.\n\nMan Utd are patiently passing the ball around halfway, but they aren't testing Newcastle at all.\n\nThis is a bit dreary, to be honest. It's got a bizarre winner written all over it.\n\n5:39PM\n\n49 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nYedlin catches Young on the head as the Man Utd defender slides in to win the ball - it was totally inadvertent, though, and it seems the game will restart with a drop-ball.\n\nMike Dean doesn't know how to restart, here, either. Eventually there is a drop-ball that Man Utd bizarrely do not contest.\n\nYoung seems fine, too.\n\n5:36PM\n\n47 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nManchester Utd break down the left at nthe start of the second half through Rashford, before Almir\u00f3n fouls him in full flight. Mike Dean debates the yellow card but decides against it. Schar kicks the ball away, however, adn he does go in the book.\n\nSaint-Maximin breaks away following the Newcastle clearance, he releases Almir\u00f3n who hits it wide first time on his left foot.\n\n5:29PM\n\nSteve Bruce stat\n\nSteve Bruce has never won against Manchester United as a manager. This is his 23rd attempt and it's becoming increasingly clear that he will never get a better chance to get one over his old club.\n\nCredit: GETTY IMAGES\n\n5:20PM\n\nHalf-time: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nTwo teams short on confidence in wet weather, it was always going to be a bit like this, wasn't it? Both teams have had chances, however, with Maguire's header and Almir\u00f3n's run in behind the best of the two sides' respective efforts.\n\nSteve Bruce will probably be the happier of the two managers at half-time, but it's not total panic stations for Solskjaer yet.\n\n5:18PM\n\nHalf-time: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nMan Utd are happy to just knock the ball around halfway until referee Mike Dean blows his whistle.\n\nSaint-Maximin went down awkwardly at the end of the half - he has looked threatening at times, it will be interesting to see if he comes back out for the second half.\n\n5:16PM\n\n44 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nJoelinton fouls Tuanzebe, who has looked good for Man Utd, on halfway as Man Utd look to attack.\n\nSchar heads away a Dalot cross over the bar. It was a good cross and Pereira was behind the Newcastle defender so he had to intervene.\n\nIt's a great follow-up corner, too, and Maguire loses his marker. He has a free header on goal but he clips it wide. A massive chance and it should have been 1-0 Man Utd.\n\nMaguire looks gutted.\n\n5:13PM\n\n42 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nNewcastle come back through Almir\u00f3n, before Joelinton half-heads a cross that skids to Willems, who has a shot that is blocked and goes for a corner.\n\nBut Sean Longstaff's corner is poor and De Gea has goal kick.\n\n5:11PM\n\n41 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nMata and Rashford work the ball nicely in the Newcastle half as Man Utd work their way deep into Newcastle territory.\n\nPereira on the half-turn, dribbles, and then gets a long-range shot away at Dubravka but it's easy for the Newcastle keeper.\n\n5:10PM\n\n39 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nAlmir\u00f3n is in behind and he has a one-on-one with De Gea! There's no flag but the Newcastle striker takes an age to shoot, and Maguire gets back to block his effort. That was the best chance of the game so far.\n\n5:09PM\n\n37 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nA sloppy Tuanzebe gives the ball away to Sean Longstaff, but the Man Utd defender works back well to win the ball back.\n\nMan Utd look very comfortable on the ball, and they have had a lot of possession, but they are lacking penetration. Fred attempts a lob to no one and Dubravka laps the ball up easily.\n\n5:06PM\n\n35 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nA great ball from Matty Longstaff finds Willems, who feeds Saint-Maximin down the left, before the Frenchman attempts some step-over trickery and wins a corner.\n\nYoung is fouled while carrying out the clearing header though, and Man Utd can clear easily.\n\n5:03PM\n\n32 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nSteve Bruce wanted some fight and he's got it. Man Utd, although they have not been poor by any stretch, have had to fight for everything.\n\nThey eventually make their way up the field with admirable patience, Young and Fred exchanging passes regularly, before a risky pass to Mata skids off the turf for a goal kick.\n\n5:01PM\n\n30 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nSch\u00e4r gets to it first at the near post and glances a header goalwards, but it's just over the bar. That was a chance.\n\nYellow card to McTominay after Manchester Utd lose possession. That was a stonewall booking and, any worse, it could have been red. His studs were up, but he did pull his leg away slightly.\n\nVAR did check and decided yellow is correct.\n\nSteve Bruce will be very happy with this opening half an hour.\n\n4:57PM\n\n26 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nJoelinton nearly intercepts a pass to Maguire - that would have been really dangerous!\n\nSaint-Maximin then pops up with the ball, but he is trying to do everything himself; he dribbles well but is eventually dispossessed after travelling too far.\n\nFollowing that dispossession, Young finds himself in another cross-able position on the left, but Newcastle head away again as no Man Utd player attacks the ball.\n\n4:54PM\n\n23 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nJames is fouled again - this time by Longstaff - and Young has another chance to whip a cross in. He does just that but it is headed away by Sch\u00e4r.\n\nMan Utd come straight back, however, before an audacious attempt at a cross from James results in a goal kick for Newcastle.\n\n4:53PM\n\n21 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nSch\u00e4r gives away a clumsy free-kick down in the left corner as he bundles into James.\n\nThis could be dangerous for Newcastle, as Young whips the free-kick in from the left corner flag, but it's too close to Dubravka who takes with ease.\n\n200 days since Man Utd have scored a goal from a set-piece, incidentally.\n\n4:51PM\n\n19 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nLascelles tracks back superbly to put in a great tackle on Rashford as it seemed as if Man Utd were building strongly down the right.\n\nMan Utd continue pushing, but Rashford is caught offside. Newcastle are not defending too deep, then.\n\n4:48PM\n\n17 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nRashford, Dalot and Pereira intertwine cutely before Mata gets in behind! But the flag is up and Man Utd's first chance goes begging.\n\nNewcaslte are straight back on the counter after a lovely ball from Yedlin, but Newcastle's attempted cross is headed away well by Tuanzebe.\n\n4:46PM\n\n15 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nPereira is dispossessed by Shaun Longstaff before the former is fouled by Clark as he tried to regain possession. James stumbled as Man Utd looked to build an attack and Newcastle are able to clear.\n\nA frustrated James then takes out a charging Yedlin and he is lucky to escape a booking.\n\nNewcastle take the free-kick quickly - they have clearly decided that pace is best.\n\nIt comes to nothing, however, and Yedlin receives a yellow card himself (probably in frustration) after he lunges in with studs showing and gets none of the ball.\n\n4:43PM\n\n12 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nThere is danger for Man Utd as a tame backpass is almost intercepted by Saint-Maximin. The Frenchman then does get a shot away, however, from the resulting clearance, and it is well struck but it does not trouble De Gea.\n\n4:40PM\n\n8 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nNewcastle's back five remains strong, however, and Rashford cannot prevent a slightly wayward pass from trickling out for a throw-in. Yedlin clears before Man Utd play the ball back to De Gea, whose pass is inaccurate and, like his opposite number Dubravka's earlier effort, sails out for a throw-in.\n\n4:37PM\n\n6 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nMan Utd with the patient build-up play as they make their way into Newcastle territory. But Ashley Young is not able to control a pass on the greasy surface and Newcastle get the throw-in and clear.\n\nYoung Matty Longstaff has started energetically, too, as Dubravka's clearance flies straight for a throw-in and Manchester United will launch another attack.\n\n4:34PM\n\n4 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nFree-kick to Newcastle on the edge of the Man Utd box after Almir\u00f3n gets on the wrong side of Fred, and the Brazilian gives him a little tug of the shirt and trips him, too. He receives a yellow card.\n\nThe free-kick is blocked by Man Utd's wall and, as James look to break for Man Utd, Yedlin gets back well to clear.\n\nThe referee today is Mike Dean, by the way.\n\n4:32PM\n\n2 min: Newcastle 0 Man Utd 0\n\nGreat start from Newcastle as Saint-Maximin charges straight at the Man Utd back four. He threads a pass to Almir\u00f3n on the edge of the box who tries to cross in, but it's well blocked by Maguire and Man Utd clear from the corner.\n\n4:31PM\n\nWeather update from St James' Park\n\nThe teams are on their way out, at a slippery St James' Park.\n\nweather update\n\n4:22PM\n\nSteve Bruce speaks to Sky Sports\n\nNothing drastic [with today's team selection] - but I had to change something. Ciaran Clark trains every day like it's his last so he certainly deserves an opportunity.

The young one has caught my eye with his energy and the way that he plays, so I'm sure he will do great. You do not get a lot of time these days; we are seven games in and we have played some of the top teams in the division. I'm still coming to terms with players that I haven't even seen play yet.

If you win games you are happier, your mood changes but it doesn't mean your performances have been better - results change mood.\"\n\nSolskjaer however praised the fans for sticking with the side and assured them that the team is working hard to \"pay them back for their loyalty.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Newcastle head coach Bruce has revealed that Ferguson, under whom he enjoyed such success as a player at Manchester United, is only a phone call away when problems arise.\n\nAsked if he had spoken to him recently, the Magpies boss said:\n\n\"I've spoken to him a couple of times. I always ring him for a bit of advice now and again. I saw him on Monday night at Old Trafford. \"He has been terrific, and not just for me. For any other manager, if there is ever a time you need a bit of advice, he is always there to help you.\"\n\nAsked what Ferguson had said to him on Monday evening, Bruce replied with a smile: \"You don't want to know.\"\n\nBruce was part of the United team which famously won 1-0 at St James' in March 1996 courtesy of Eric Cantona's goal as they reeled in Kevin Keegan's Newcastle to deny them a first league title since 1927.\n\nFerguson won 13 Premier League titles as he built a series of teams which also dominated in Europe, although the club has found the going tougher since his retirement in 2013.\n\nBruce said:", "description": "Matty Longstaff sent Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Manchester United into a tailspin by firing hometown club\u00a0Newcastle\u00a0to victory on a dream Premier League debut.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qg6BB_mZ0bqdczBjyd7Djw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nuf7NhF2_vt3W3ES3ucUHQ--~B/aD0xNTYyO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/f66bcaa700def9946ca02e1101eb2fe5", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
