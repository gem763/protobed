Several other firms were eliminated from the bidding earlier.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper this week said he was withdrawing from reviewing the contract to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. His son worked for one of the original bidders that was no longer in the running for the deal.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 25, 2019 19:48 ET (23:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
