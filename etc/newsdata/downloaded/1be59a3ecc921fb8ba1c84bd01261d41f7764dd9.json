That was part of the Chinese response to the rift that started when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong and intensified when Silver defended Morey\u2019s right to exercise free speech.\n\nThis time, it was the NBA\u2019s call.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Lakers and Nets may have spoken Friday in advance of the game and then coaches and players would be made available to talk both before and after Saturday\u2019s contest. No player or coach from either team has reacted publicly to the fallout surrounding Morey\u2019s tweet, which was deleted quickly though continues to remain a major problem for the league and its relationship with the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nThe Rockets were asked repeatedly about the situation during their two-game trip to Japan earlier this week for games with the reigning NBA champion Toronto Raptors. A Rockets media relations official stopped Houston guards James Harden and Russell Westbrook from answering a question from a CNN reporter Thursday about whether they would continue to speak out about political and societal matters. That prompted an apology from the NBA, who said that decision \u201cwas inconsistent with how the NBA conducts media events.\u201d\n\nIn Tokyo, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said questions about the China-NBA rift are thorny to answer.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t answer questions like that because you\u2019re wrong no matter what,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cI\u2019m here to speak basketball, talk basketball. \u2026 Hey, I coach basketball. I\u2019m not a diplomat.\u201d\n\nSilver spoke earlier this week and said the league would continue protecting freedom of expression for its players and employees. Morey\u2019s tweet was criticized by Nets chairman Joe Tsai, who is in China for this week\u2019s games and is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent to both be apologetic that that was the outcome of that speech but at the same time support Daryl\u2019s right to his freedom of expression and Joe Tsai\u2019s right to respond,\u201d Silver said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "The NBA will complete its trip to China in silence.
