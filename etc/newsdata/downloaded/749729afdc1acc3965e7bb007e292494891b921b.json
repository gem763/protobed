The stripper-comedian-activist was at this club a few months ago, when it was the film set for Hustlers, a movie based on the New York magazine article about a band of strippers who drugged their Wall Street clients to steal their money. Jacq, whose Instagram and website sells T-shirts and artwork that say things like \u201ctip her\u201d and \u201cI want you to overcome your whoreophobia,\u201d was hired as a consultant for the movie and has a brief cameo where J.Lo grabs her boobs. \u201cI participated in this project because I wanted to be fondled by J.Lo,\u201d she says about that experience.\n\nFifteen feet above Jacq\u2019s head, another stripper has her red glitter pumps firmly planted on the ceiling as she twerks upside-down Spider-Man style before sliding headfirst down the pole at rocket speed. If the dancer miscalculates, she could easily fall and crack open her skull. It\u2019s a feeling of precariousness that Jacq can relate to. This week is the premiere of Hustlers and the stakes are high for Jacq. She is anxious about what her peers in the sex worker community will think and also about the message the film will portray to \u201ccivilians,\u201d the label strippers sometimes use for non-strippers.\n\nFor weeks, strip club locker rooms have been abuzz with debates about the movie. Was it exploitative or was it bringing the stripper narrative into the mainstream? Many sex workers wanted to know why Hollywood gets to portray sex workers\u2019 stories while actual sex workers are censored on social media all the time. Strippers like Jacq have been affected by the controversial bill package FOSTA-SESTA\u2014ostensibly meant to prevent sex trafficking online\u2014which has shut down many sex worker\u2019s social media profiles, forcing them offline and into overcrowded clubs. It\u2019s exacerbating the problems of discrimination, racism, and abuse that sex workers have faced at the hands of both managers and their clients since time immemorial.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, Jacq stood in front of the Cinepolis cinema in Chelsea, waiting for a girl squad of five sex workers to go see Hustlers for the first time. The squad tonight is a premier selection of New York\u2019s sex-worker-activist elite. There is Gizelle Marie, an activist for the black stripper community and one of the leading voices of last year\u2019s stripper strike; Valley Latini, a singer-songwriter-stripper whose hit is \u201cPay My Rent\u201d; SX Noir, a self-described \u201cthot leader\u201d and advocate for sex workers; and ButterflyMush, a stripper turned artist who\u2019s wearing a bag she painted herself that says \u201cgirls just want to have funds.\u201d As they walk with buckets of popcorn and chocolate mint candies wearing bondage-themed belts, lucite heels, and cheetah print, they look the sex-worker edition of the Spice Girls.\n\nAs the previews play, Gizelle Marie casually counts a wad of cash as she tells me that she didn\u2019t even want to see the movie because she\u2019s traumatized by how the media represents sex workers and was doubtful Hustlers would be any different. The story of the stripper, she tells me, \u201cis either glamorized or goes into this, What trauma happened to you? What did your daddy do to you?-type narrative.\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more complicated than that.\u201d\n\nWhen the movie begins, Gizelle shrieks: \u201cOh my God is that the manager of Show Palace?\u201d She would know\u2014Gizelle began stripping at 18 at Sin City in the Bronx and has worked in pretty much every club in New York since. Over the years, she\u2019s become so outspoken against the pervasive racism and body-shaming in clubs that many have banned her from working.\n\nGizelle\u2019s eyes widen as she watches the movie, and she keeps gripping my hand and telling me, \u201cThat\u2019s accurate!!\u201d There's a montage of scenes she relates to: a stripper talks about not even wanting to have sex with her boyfriend by the time she gets home from work; a client can\u2019t stop asking about a stripper\u2019s daddy issues; another stripper gets chewed out by a jealous boyfriend; a manager takes a larger cut of a stripper\u2019s salary than he promised; and Constance Wu\u2019s character barely takes home any money after she splits it with the DJ, security, the bartender, and the house mom.\n\nAt one point J.Lo\u2019s character says, \u201cThis whole country is a strip club. You got people tossing the money and people doing the dance.\u201d \u201cNow that is the real truth,\u201d says Gizelle. In the next scene, it\u2019s a cold night on the strip-club roof and J.Lo wraps Constance Wu\u2019s character in her fur coat. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s not true! Strippers are not that nice to each other!\u201d says Gizelle. \u201cI mean, I am! But not everybody is and we should be if we want to move ahead.\u201d\n\nI look over and see that Valley Latini is sobbing. On screen, J.Lo is cutting the string of a tampon for the young and vulnerable character of Lili Reinhart as Reinhart cries on the floor, telling J.Lo that her family stopped talking to her when they found out she\u2019s a stripper. \u201cIt\u2019s just so real and relatable,\u201d Latini tells me afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be so emotional. It\u2019s just so amazing to see our struggles being told up on the big screen like that.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, we pile into ButterflyMush\u2019s car and head to the strip club\u2014but first, she removes her son\u2019s car seat so we can all climb in the backseat. ButterflyMush knew the girls who the movie is based on and danced with one of them in Vegas. The movie doesn\u2019t follow their plot line exactly, but there are some parts ButterflyMush recognizes as true: \u201cThat part in the movie where girls try to copy them? I saw that happen, that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\n\u201c I didn\u2019t expect it to be so emotional. It\u2019s just so amazing to see our struggles being told up on the big screen like that. \u201d\n\nHustlers shows how much harder the industry became for strippers after the 2008 stock market crash and the lengths some were willing to go to survive. As we cross the Queensboro Bridge, SX Noir leans in and sums it up: \u201cHustlers is really about the redistribution of wealth. Sure it is empowering, but really this movie is about surviving under capitalism post-2008 financial crash.\u201d SX Noir says that much of the time, clients are stingy in compensating sex workers for the emotional labor they provide, in addition to the physical. \u201cI hope that people who watch this see that it takes work to be a stripper. It takes talent, skill and business smarts. It is work, these women are out here working.\u201d\n\nWhen we get to the club, a girl in a blue wig comes over and throws her arms around Jacq. \u201cI go on your page all the time when I need inspiration,\u201d she says before bursting into tears. \u201cIt\u2019s just so fucking hard. I worked 6 hours in the VIP room last week and barely made any money.\u201d This is true especially when you\u2019re a black stripper. \u201cThese clubs will say they\u2019re not racist but you go for auditions and they never call you back,\u201d she says. \u201cI gotta stop crying it\u2019s fucking up my eyelashes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d says Gizelle Marie. \u201cThe struggle is real. We need more spaces that are inclusive of all colors and body types.\u201d Later in the night, a girl comes over to Gizelle Marie: \u201cI had to meet you in person, you\u2019re the reason I got into stripping.\u201d For the girls in this club, Jacq and Gizelle, who have risked their careers to speak up on stripper\u2019s issues, are heroes.\n\nJacq is holding a glass of champagne in one hand and a clear purse that shows off the $1,800 in cash inside of it. She wants to spend all of it tonight to redistribute the money the strippers lost out on during the week the club was closed for Hustlers\u2019 filming. Sitting in a leather chair holding a fat stack of bills is Lorene Scafaria, the director and writer of Hustlers. \u201cWe had auditions and hired some of them,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI wish we could have hired all the girls.\u201d I ask her how she is feeling about the community\u2019s reactions to the movie. \u201cI was really nervous for the girl\u2019s reactions. It\u2019s so sensitive telling a story about a community and I wanted to do it right, \u201d she muses as she places a few bills in the mesh bodysuit of a stripper\u2019s ass vibrating at eye-level. \u201cIt makes me nostalgic to be here. I just want to go to back to the locker room, that\u2019s where I feel most at home.\u201d\n\nBut she needn\u2019t have worried, at least for this group of strippers. \u201cI think every stripper needs to see this movie,\u201d Gizelle tells me. In one of the opening scenes of Hustlers, J.Lo does a split on stage, and her lack of flexibility causes Gizelle to laugh. \u201cDamn, J.Lo can\u2019t do a split!\u201d she exclaims. Four hours later, on stage in front of us, a dancer melts into a split like butter on a hot frying plan. \u201cNow that,\u201d Gizelle says with a nod, \u201cis how it\u2019s really done.\u201d", "description": "My wild night seeing \u201cHustlers\u201d and hitting the strip club with a group of brutally honest strippers.", "authors": ["Summer Eldemire", "Cheat Sheet Intern"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568508459/unnamed_12_medbzq", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
