Frank S. Besson-class Logistic Support Vessels, its largest class of ships, as well as 34 Landing Craft Utility, and 36 Landing Craft Mechanized Mk-8, in addition to a number of tugs, small ferries, and barges.\n\nLanding craft move personnel and cargo from bases and ships to harbors, beaches, and contested or damaged ports. Ship-to-shore enablers allow the transfer of cargo at sea, and towing and terminal operators support operations in different environments.\n\n\"The Army has these unique capabilities to redeploy their forces or insert their forces into an austere environment if needed,\" Sgt. 1st Class Chase Conner, assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade, said during an exercise in summer 2018.\n\nIn 2017, the Army awarded a nearly billion-dollar contract for 36 new, modern landing craft. But in January 2018, then-Army Secretary Mark Esper, who is now secretary of defense, decided the Army Reserve would divest \"all watercraft systems\" in preparation for the service's 2020 budget.\n\nEsper said the Army had found $25 billion that could be cut and spent on other projects.", "description": "The Army's sudden move to divest much of its watercraft fleet raised alarm.
