His son Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative contracts with Ukraine \u2014 at the same time the vice president was in charge of U.S. policy toward the country raised \u2014 raised the prospect of fueling a narrative with downside political risk for Biden.\n\n\u201cThis puts him on the ropes over having to talk about this,\u201d said Patrick Murray, a pollster with Monmouth University. \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to talk about this, his family.\u201d\n\nMurray suggested the ethical dimensions of the controversy \u2014 and the implications of Trump\u2019s actions for impeachment, which Biden at present does not support \u2014 made any extended discussion of the story potentially perilous for Biden.\n\n\u201cAt the primary level, I don\u2019t think Democrats would believe these charges [concerning Biden] because of how polarized the debate is right now, but then they could start worrying that this could hurt him if he is the nominee,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018can Biden fight back? Will this hurt his ability to take Trump on fully?\u2019 And will it undermine that electability argument that he\u2019s been making?\u201d\n\nIn Florida, former Democratic nominee for governor and progressive activist Andrew Gillum said he was left feeling Biden came across as \u201cdefensive\u201d when he initially spoke to reporters.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u201cI saw Biden\u2019s response and was shocked that he wasn\u2019t more incredulous about the president\u2019s action,\u201d Gillum said, stressing that Biden \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to answer for any of these allegations, as if to give them credibility. He should go directly at the president!\u201d\n\nGillum added that others could \u201cargue that his calmness and sensibilities may be exactly what the doctor ordered when compared to Trump.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the evening Friday, Biden\u2019s campaign put caution aside and began fundraising off the issue, using it to advance his core argument that he\u2019s the best candidate to beat Trump.\n\n\u201cThis sort of behavior tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump and the people around him,\u201d the campaign emailed supporters in a fundraising pitch. \u201cBut it also tells you what he\u2019s worried about.\u201d\n\nHowever, even before Biden began running, Republicans as well as Democrats affiliated with his primary rivals said the imbroglio with Hunter Biden would help the president neutralize attacks against him \u2014 even if it paled next to voluminous evidence of Trump\u2019s transgressions.\n\nFor months, Biden has sidestepped questions about his son\u2019s business dealings, which were criticized when they were reported in 2015 by both The New York Times as well as Russia\u2019s state-run Izvestia news service.\n\nThe controversy can be traced back to March 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in Eastern Ukraine, setting off an international crisis. As the administration\u2019s point-man on Ukraine, Biden led the U.S. response.\n\nThat April, Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was appointed to the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company, despite lacking substantive experience working in Ukraine or the energy sector. He received compensation that was reportedly as high as $50,000 a month.\n\nAt the time, Burisma was seeking to build inroads to U.S. Democrats as it faced investigative scrutiny. The same month Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the U.K. government froze bank accounts that allegedly belonged to its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, as part of a money laundering investigation.\n\nTwo years later, Joe Biden successfully pressured the Ukrainian government to remove its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who was unpopular with Western leaders, threatening to withhold loan guarantees if it did not. At the time, Shokin's office had open probes of Burisma and Zlochevsky. Shokin\u2019s successor closed the investigations, but then reopened an investigation of Burisma last year.\n\nHunter Biden has said he was not involved in the investigations. Spokespeople for Joe Biden have said his son's dealings did not influence his official actions, and no evidence has emerged of wrongdoing on his part in the matter.\n\nIn a sign that Trump has no hesitation about attacking Biden over his perceived weaknesses, the president\u2019s campaign recently released a mashup video compilation questioning Biden\u2019s mental stability and his penchant for misspeaking.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign co-chair, Rep. Cedric Richmond, dismissed the notion that the new revelations could in any way muddy Biden\u2019s electability argument in the primary.\n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so at all,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cIn Congress, we work to get the facts out, we will continue to do that. But I think it\u2019s very concerning for Trump that he would ask for help from a foreign government [to investigate] not just the frontrunner, but the guy who\u2019s beating him by double digits in all the polls \u2026 the Vice President has said he\u2019s confident he\u2019ll beat Trump. The actions that are revealed now shows that Trump believes [Biden] will beat him.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign also appears ready to turn the issue into a referendum about a favorite target: the news media.\n\n\u201cThe press is playing into Donald Trump\u2019s hands talking about this,\u201d said a top Biden advisor. \u201cReputable news organizations have concluded there\u2019s nothing here. This is not a Joe Biden problem. This is a Donald Trump problem.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s focus on Biden could actually be beneficial, said David Axelrod, Barack Obama\u2019s longtime strategist.\n\n\u201cI think, at least in the short run, it\u2019s more likely to identify Biden as the candidate Trump fears and, perhaps, even benefit him among Democrats,\u201d Axelrod told POLITICO.", "description": "An extended discussion about his son\u2019s business dealings isn\u2019t helpful to Biden\u2019s electability argument.", "authors": ["Marc Caputo", "Natasha Korecki", "Ben Schreckinger"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/88/f1/0b98ecf84dfbb8325a55344cfe5c/19921-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
