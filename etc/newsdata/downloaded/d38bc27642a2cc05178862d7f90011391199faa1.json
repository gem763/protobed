Here are the predictions for this season from Yahoo Sports\u2019 NFL writers.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nMost Valuable Player: Half of our eight panelists are going with a repeat for Patrick Mahomes. Even if Mahomes has a regression from his 5,000-yard, 50-touchdown season, he can still put up monster numbers to win the award. And the Chiefs should be a Super Bowl contender.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\nDefensive player of the year: Six different players got votes. There were five pass rushers and Terez Paylor took Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Aaron Donald and Khalil Mack were the two to get multiple votes.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\nRookie of the year: We combined the offensive and defensive rookie of the year awards into one, and not surprisingly No. 1 overall pick Kyler Murray got four of the votes. Kimberley A. Martin was the only one to take a defensive player, choosing Steelers linebacker Devin Bush.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\nCoach of the year: Some very interesting choices here, and it was surprising to see which two coaches got multiple votes: Jets coach Adam Gase and Packers rookie head coach Matt LaFleur.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\nBiggest surprise: Our writers were allowed to pick any team, player or coach for this category, and they landed on differing opinions on the Giants quarterback controversy, with some love for the Bills and Jaguars.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\nStory continues\n\nBiggest disappointment: Not a lot of faith for the Chicago Bears here, as two writers picked them to miss the playoffs. Saints, Cowboys, Chargers and Cardinals fans might want to clip and save this one too.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\nSuper Bowl picks: The Chiefs, Patriots, Eagles and Saints got most of the attention here, taking up every slot except Frank Schwab\u2019s pick of the Chargers to win the AFC. Curiously nobody picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl, and that probably means New England will win yet another title in February.\n\n(Yahoo Sports graphics by Paul Rosales)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The NFL's 100th season is about to start, and our writers predict what will happen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5Oc9UVQ_vDO1BoL6U9oWpg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/63dqiiQkd70xsQNZcg6kHg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MzM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/5ca2fb40-cfeb-11e9-9273-8955eb87ffc3", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
