A lot of us would not be where we are now if it was not for him. All we can do is thank him.\n\n\"We have always trusted him 100 per cent and we are going to keep doing that. We are a team. When things are not going our way it is easy for people to try and get at the manager but we need to look at ourselves as players. We are doing that and we are going to keep working hard.\"", "description": "Dele Alli insists Tottenham's players remain \"1,000 per cent\" behind Mauricio Pochettino and that the reaction to their poor start to the season has been overblown.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213500014-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
