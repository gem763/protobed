His allies aren\u2019t so sure.", "language": "en", "text": "Under intense questioning from CNN in Iowa, Ernst on Wednesday said she didn\u2019t have enough information to determine whether Trump\u2019s actions were appropriate. Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins has avoided addressing the situation by saying she may have to be a juror at Trump\u2019s trial, though Collins pushed back against Trump\u2019s call for China to probe Biden. On Thursday, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner repeatedly spun the question into attacks on House Democrats and deferred to the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nDemocrats are taking notice. In an interview Thursday, aisle-crossing Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said he\u2019d spoken to two Senate Republican colleagues this week who either changed the subject or got off the phone with him when he brought up Ukraine.\n\nCoons said he is no longer sure that the Senate GOP would unanimously let Trump off the hook at a trial, but added that Republicans\u2019 immediate political concern over facing a mean Trump tweet might override all other factors.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump really goes after anyone who is anything less than completely supportive. The way he\u2019s gone back after Sen. Romney is inappropriate and disgraceful,\u201d Coons said. \u201cIf I were a Republican senator, I would make a pretty tough but prompt assessment that history will judge harshly those who do not show some independence from this president.\u201d\n\nSome Republican senators are starting to coalesce behind a wrist-slapping strategy with Trump. What Trump did was not right, they say, but neither is impeachment. It\u2019s movement away from Trump, but not in any way that has Senate Republican officials worried about defections.\n\nThe latest Republicans to take that line on Thursday were Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, who is up for reelection, and retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who called Trump\u2019s action \u201cinappropriate,\u201d while quickly adding that impeachment is \u201ca mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I wish President Trump hadn\u2019t raised the issue with the Ukrainian president? Yes,\u201d Cornyn wrote in a fundraising email. \u201cBut really, is it right for Democrats to now call for his removal for office over this?\u201d\n\nOther Republican senators willing to admonish Trump pivoted into attacks on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff or the impeachment process itself. Senior Republicans expect many in the party will land on that as the safest approach.\n\nSuch a strategy has seemingly paid off for the likes of Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who have avoided any Trump attacks on Twitter despite publicly breaking with the president on his calls for China to investigate Biden. The same goes for Grassley and Ernst, who stood up for whistleblowers amid Trump\u2019s attacks on the official who filed the initial complaint about the phone call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to probe the Biden family.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Bill Cassidy (R-La.). \u201cTo my mind, it does not pass that sort of impeachable test.\u201d\n\nGiven all the tightrope walking, Republicans close to Trump recognize that his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s most definitely a group of Republican senators who are not originally Trump fans that have endorsed him begrudgingly, who have warmed up to him as their fortunes rise,\u201d said a former senior Trump administration official.\n\nStill other Trump allies acknowledge that while the president could lose a popularity contest in the Senate, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s about to be tossed from the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cAre there some senators who would like to vote to convict Trump? Sure,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. \u201cAre there some people who don\u2019t like Trump? Sure.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, there are \u201cvery few Republican senators\u201d who are \u201cprepared to say as a historic duty that they believe that the choice of the American people should be repudiated because he\u2019s done something sufficiently bad.\u201d\n\nRepublicans close to the White House also say Trump has an ace up his sleeve: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who, they reason, has the president\u2019s back. Earlier this week, McConnell attacked the House investigatory process, earning a Trump attaboy on Twitter. McConnell is also running for reelection himself in a state that loves Trump.\n\n\u201cThe one person you want more than anyone is Mitch McConnell. He\u2019s a master of the chamber,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the former Trump White House press secretary. \u201cAnd as long as he\u2019s on your side, you\u2019re OK.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Sen.
