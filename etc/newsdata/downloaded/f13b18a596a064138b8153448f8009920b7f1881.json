Likewise, he's affirmed that renewed Fed purchases of bonds are not a new round of quantitative easing, but rather an adjustment to correct a shortage of bank reserves.\n\nHistorically, a mid-cycle adjustment, such as those seen in 1995 and 1998, can be 0.75 points, which is the total of what would be three rate cuts since July. Building a buffer of bank reserves is legitimate in the wake of money market turmoil when suddenly there weren\u2019t enough.\n\nStill, essentially, the Fed has made not one, but two mistakes. First, it set itself on a path to raise rates in 2018, mistakenly thinking economic growth would push inflation up. And it kept on that path in the face of all evidence to the contrary\u2014 was not going up despite low . Instead, the labor market continued to expand.\n\nThe second mistake was to willy-nilly start winding down its balance sheet after pumping it up with quantitative easing. In the process, it cut bank reserves in half, to $1.4 trillion from $2.8 trillion.\n\nTurns out that's not nearly enough to cover overnight lending needs at peak periods like the one that occurred September 16-17. Economists want the U.S. central bank to add $400 billion to bank reserves and grow that in line with the economy.\n\nThen there's U.S. President Donald Trump who's angry with the Fed because he wants them to turbo-charge the economy with cheap credit. Of course, investors have a right to be angry because the Fed keeps making big mistakes.\n\nIf policy makers are in fact able to wipe the slate clean on both fronts by reducing rates once more and restoring bank reserves to a sufficient level, can we sit back and relax? Perhaps.\n\nBut this inability to settle on appropriate policy has not contributed to investor confidence in the Fed under Powell\u2019s guidance. This loss of credibility may be its biggest problem.\n\nPowell needs to assert his leadership. There are members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that question the need for further interest rate cuts in spite of trade tensions and some indications of economic softness. Maybe they could sit on their hands for once and be satisfied with forward guidance that there will be no further cuts in the immediate future. It would be so much more credible if this rate cut could emerge with no formal dissents.\n\nInvestors can help, too. Markets should take Powell at his word if he finally does have it right. Sure, even lower rates would be nice, but this should really be enough for a mid-cycle adjustment. Yes, asset purchases are asset purchases and a bigger Fed balance sheet is by definition accommodative. But this, too, is a fine-tuning of monetary policy, not a change of course.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Darrell Delamaide/Investing.com) covering: .
