REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\n\u201cIt puts a little thrill in you when you\u2019re walking around at night to see the spooky mausoleums and the headstones,\u201d said Bottum as he toured the ornate burial ground in New York\u2019s Bronx borough. \u201cI\u2019m 35 going on 12.\u201d\n\nGuided excursions through historic graveyards such as Woodlawn, home of the Moonlight Illuminated Mausoleum Tour, have become a hot ticket across the United States around Halloween, celebrated on Oct. 31. The tours are a small slice of what has grown into a multi-billion dollar holiday industry - ranging from food and drinks to costumes and entertainment - designed to excite and amuse adults as much as their children.\n\nOn the cemetery circuit, celebrity spirits are the big draw. Beer baron Frederick Pabst lies in Milwaukee\u2019s Forest Home Cemetery, and \u201cGone With The Wind\u201d author Margaret Mitchell is a highlight of Atlanta\u2019s Oakland Cemetery.\n\nRich in history and stunning in architectural detail, all three cemeteries are listed on the U.S. National Park Service\u2019s National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWoman\u2019s rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton is among the many famous people interred at Woodlawn. But tour guide Nestor Danyluk says perhaps the most intriguing soul who inhabits the graveyard is Olive Thomas - hardly a household name today but a silent film starlet in the early 1900s who was known as \u201cEverybody\u2019s Sweetheart.\u201d\n\nThomas was a one-time Ziegfeld Follies chorus girl whose ghost is said to haunt the New Amsterdam Theatre, current home of the Broadway musical \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nThomas was married to actor Jack Pickford and died at age 25 in 1920 after drinking poison at a Paris hotel. It was never determined whether her death was an accident, suicide or murder, said cemetery historian Susan Olsen.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very flirtatious ghost,\u201d Danyluk told his audience of 20 at Thomas\u2019 granite mausoleum, adding that her spirit is said to appear at the Broadway theatre, where she once danced in shows.\n\n\u201cShe loves to sneak up behind men and tug on their shirts or put her hand up their pants legs. If you\u2019re feeling an odd sensation on your calves, it could be Olive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018ENLIGHTEN, NOT FRIGHTEN\u2019\n\nDespite the Halloween trappings, tour organizers say their aim is to share local history and cultivate pride in the community.\n\n\u201cOur tours are designed to enlighten, not frighten,\u201d said marketing manager Angie Wynne in Atlanta, where tickets for \u201cCapturing the Spirit of Oakland Halloween Tours\u201d sold out months ahead, in July.\n\nJulia Griffith, programme director at Historic Milwaukee, said volunteer guides wear Victorian-era clothing on evening tours at the 1850 cemetery where beer mogul Joseph Schlitz is interred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a spooky theme but they act as the various movers and shakers of Milwaukee who are buried there,\u201d Griffith said.\n\nWoodlawn, a 400-acre cemetery in the Bronx that opened during the American Civil War in 1863, is the final resting place for such American legends as Ellington, trumpeter Miles Davis, bandleader Lionel Hampton, songster Irving Berlin and \u201cMoby Dick\u201d author Herman Melville.\n\nIt also houses the stately tombs of department store moguls Frank Winfield Woolworth, James Cash Penney Jr. and Macy\u2019s co-owner Isidor Straus. His wife\u2019s refusal to leave his side for a rescue boat during the sinking of the Titanic was a memorable scene in films about the 1912 tragedy.\n\nThe Woodlawn tour, which invites guests to bring their own flashlights, has sold out annually since it was first offered in 2016, with more than 250 tickets snapped up this year at about $25 each, said Barbara Selesky, Woodlawn\u2019s marketing director.\n\nTourists look at the Webb family mausoleum during the Moonlight Mausoleum tour at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx in New York City, New York, U.S., October 25, 2019.
