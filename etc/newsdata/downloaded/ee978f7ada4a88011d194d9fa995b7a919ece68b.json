Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have met privately with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to a report in Politico.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s outreach to conservative is part of a wider effort to blunt scrutiny and potential regulation from the political right, which has exposed Facebook and other big tech companies for censorship and bias against conservatives. Breitbart News has reported exclusively on Facebook\u2019s \u201chate agents\u201d list, which the company uses to monitor high-profile political figures for potential banning.\n\nPolitico reports that the meetings were hosted at one of Zuckerberg\u2019s homes in California, and lasted two to three hours. A source familiar with the situation told Politico that the conversations revolved around \u201cfree expression, unfair treatment of conservatives, the appeals process for real or perceived unfair treatment, fact checking, partnerships, and privacy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politico, those who met privately with Zuckerberg include:\n\nDaily Wire founder Ben Shapiro\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)\n\nAmerican Enterprise Institute resident fellow Matt Continetti ( See also: Google Funds Establishment Conservatives to Fight Tech Regulation )\n\n) Talk show host Hugh Hewitt\n\nTownHall.com editor Guy Benson\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson\n\nMedia Research Center founder Brent Bozell\n\nWashington Examiner correspondent Byron York\n\nMerely attending the meetings doesn\u2019t imply agreement with Zuckerberg or his policies, but the individuals who spoke to Politico about the meetings indicate that at least some of the attendees are being won over by the Facebook CEO\u2019s charm offensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that he wanted to make things right by conservatives,\u201d one person familiar with the dinners told Politico. \u201cI think he\u2019s been genuine in hoping that might happen. Sometimes I think the headwinds are so strong in Palo Alto that I don\u2019t think even he can succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy perception of him was more positive than I anticipated,\u201d another person familiar with the meetings told Politico. \u201cHe was receptive and thoughtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m under no illusions that he\u2019s a conservative but I think he does care about some of our concerns,\u201d said another.\n\nRead the full report at Politico.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
