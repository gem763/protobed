Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!\" he tweeted.\n\nThe New York Times reported late on Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan were investigating Giuliani's actions regarding Ukraine as part of a case involving two of his business associates, Ukraine-born Lev Parnas and Belarus-born Igor Fruman.\n\nThe two men, who helped Giuliani investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden and his businessman son Hunter, were arrested on Thursday over what U.S. prosecutors called a scheme to illegally funnel money to a pro-Trump election committee and other political candidates.\n\nAsked about the Times report, Giuliani told Reuters: \"I never did any lobbying for anyone. If they want to ask me I\u2019m happy to prove it. But they haven\u2019t.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nTrump sowed confusion about his relationship with Giuliani on Friday, responding to a question about whether he was still his personal attorney: \"I don't know.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry against Trump on Friday that the president ousted her based on \"unfounded and false claims\" after she came under attack by Giuliani.\n\nThe inquiry is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is a leading rival seeking to face Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGiuliani has accused Yovanovitch of blocking efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
