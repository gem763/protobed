Shamefully there are some politicians who wish to absolve themselves from their positions of responsibility.\"\n\n(Image: One World Summit)\n\nAccording to the One Young World website, Meghan is a \"long-standing supporter\" of the organisation, having joined as a counsellor at the 2014 summit in Dublin.\n\nHer appearance at the summit comes after a source close to the couple told CNN the reaction to Prince Harry's comments on the ITV documentary about being on a \"different path\" to his brother had been \"hysterical\".\n\nThe source said Harry and Meghan had \"single-handedly modernised the monarchy\" and added the couple were surrounded by people \"afraid of and inexperienced\" at how best to \"deploy their value\".", "description": "Meghan Markle was full of smiles as she arrived at the One Young World Summit opening ceremony in a Aritzia purple dress, but one key moment didn't exactly go to plan...", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Pa", "David Fisher Rex", "One World Summit"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20705879.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6855JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
