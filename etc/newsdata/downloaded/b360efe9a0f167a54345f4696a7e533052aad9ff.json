He zig-zagged over topics as if he were darting through a defense.\n\nThe redshirt sophomore apologized at one point and laughed: \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not really an interesting person.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary. There are layers to the geology major just waiting to be excavated. He\u2019s the son of longtime NFL defensive lineman Albert Fontenot. He wears his dedication on his sleeve in the form of an arm tattoo that says \u201cLoyalty.\u201d He thinks big, too, and one day hopes to make his mark in the oil business.\n\nFontenot certainly struck it rich in his first start, erupting for 125 yards and three touchdowns in a win over Colorado State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d Fontenot said, \u201cto get my time to shine.\u201d\n\nTo him, that\u2019s patience and persistence personified.\n\nAs a redshirt his first season at Colorado in 2017, Fontenot used the opportunity to absorb pointers from former Colorado standout and current Denver Broncos tailback Phillip Lindsay. All set to be the starter last season, Fontenot saw graduate transfer Travon McMillian arrive that summer and take over.\n\nMore waiting.\n\nWhen his time arrived Friday, Fontenot made the most of it by exploding through the Rams defense. His three rushing touchdowns are tied for the second most in a starting debut by a Colorado tailback, behind only Michael Adkins, who had four against Charleston Southern in 2013.\n\n\u201cVery fast and shifty,\u201d said quarterback Steven Montez , whose team hosts No. 25 Nebraska on Saturday. \u201cHe makes our offense that much more dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe thought of following in his father\u2019s footsteps and becoming a defensive lineman never entered his mind.\n\nSimple, really: \u201cI didn\u2019t inherit his size,\u201d cracked the 6-foot, 195-pound Fontenot.\n\nAlthough, he was briefly a cornerback in middle school. But once he reached the high school level, his coaches at George Ranch in Richmond, Texas, switched him to tailback. In 2015, Fontenot shared the backfield with Darius Anderson, who\u2019s now at Texas Christian. They helped the Longhorns to an undefeated season, with Fontenot scoring three touchdowns in the state championship game.\n\nWhat stuck out to his coach was Fontenot\u2019s spirit.\n\n\u201cHe always celebrated Darius\u2019 accomplishments more than his own,\u201d recalled his high school coach Ricky Tullos, who\u2019s now coaching at Pearland High. \u201cHe\u2019s always been unselfish and really cares about his team and his teammates. It doesn\u2019t surprise me he was able to overcome adversity at the college level and wait for his time to shine.\u201d\n\nFor advice, Fontenot frequently chats with his dad. Most times, it\u2019s about day-to-day topics. Sometimes, it\u2019s about reading a defense. Each time, he carefully listens.\n\nAlbert Fontenot was a fourth-round pick by the Chicago Bears in 1993. The Baylor product also played for the Chargers and Indianapolis Colts while recording 27 1/2 sacks over a 130-game career.\n\nHis dad\u2019s biggest suggestion?\n\n\u201cJust do what I\u2019ve been doing my whole life,\u201d Fontenot said.\n\nHe\u2019s got a big test this weekend against a Cornhuskers defense that limited South Alabama to 83 yards rushing in the opener. It\u2019s the first meeting between the former Big Seven/Eight/12 rivals in Boulder since 2009.\n\n\u201cHave to treat it like another game,\u201d said Fontenot, who had 11 carries for 43 yards last season in spot duty, along with two blocked punts on special teams. \u201cCan\u2019t get too excited about it or too nervous.\u201d\n\nAbout that \u201cLoyalty\u201d tattoo down his left arm: It represents the importance of family, he explained.\n\nAbout his degree in geology, with a minor in atmospheric and oceanic studies: He wants to work in the oil industry and help a company find, well, oil. \u201cI like money,\u201d he joked.\n\nAnd about his running style: Full speed ahead, with a few jukes when necessary. His longest run against Colorado State was a 32-yard burst in the first quarter. He also had a 22-yard TD scamper in the fourth to wrap up the win.\n\n\u201cHis balance is his best quality,\u201d Montez said. \u201cHe can break that first tackle, whether they\u2019re pulling on his leg or grabbing him by his jersey. He kind of just slips the tackle, does a little stumble, and just goes and scores a touchdown.\u201d\n\nA performance worth the wait.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I put up the numbers I did,\u201d Fontenot said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A bundle of energy, Colorado tailback Alex Fontenot spoke in quick bursts after a recent practice.
