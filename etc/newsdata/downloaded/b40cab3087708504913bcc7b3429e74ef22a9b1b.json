Wiseman thinks we should look at the positives and take note of what the three main political parties didn\u2019t discuss: neither the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) nor immigration became major election issues.\n\n\u201cI was quite heartened because I think in the world today\u2014where there is so much divisiveness, where wedge politics play such an important part in the way parties are positioning themselves with populism\u2014on the issue of Canadian values, there was broad-based agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nWiseman has a particular interest in both topics. As the former CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), he saw the impending crisis in Canada\u2019s aging population and then had a front-row seat as the government lowered the retirement age and increased CPP contributions.\n\nI met Wiseman at his BlackRock office in Toronto on Thursday to discuss the call for Canada to increase its population to 100 million, issued this week by the Century Initiative, a non-profit he founded with five other Canadian executives including Dominic Barton, then-managing director of consulting giant McKinsey & Company. Barton was recently named Canada\u2019s ambassador to China at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries.\n\nThe Century Initiative\u2019s report makes the case for Canada to triple its population over the next 80 years, an idea also promoted by Globe and Mail columnist Doug Saunders in a 2017 book.\n\n\u201cThe thing about demographics is it\u2019s one of the only things that is entirely predictable,\u201d Wiseman told me.\n\nThose demographic predictions suggest a smaller, older Canada that he said will lead to massive productivity challenges. Think of the decades of stagnant growth in Japan or South Korea, where the birth rate has plummeted and, if current trends continue, the population could be cut in half in a single generation.\n\nThe Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index backs up Wiseman\u2019s concerns, reporting this week that Canada has a US$2.5-trillion gap between existing retirement savings and future needs. The country\u2019s lowest rating was on the long-term sustainability of its retirement income systems.\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in our future and we need to do it now,\u201d said Wiseman. (He also co-founded Focusing Capital on the Long Term, a global research organization that employs my partner.)\n\nThe financial executive acknowledges that population growth is just one critical lever for Canadian competitiveness. The other: scale.\n\n\u201cAs a small country with even 100 million, we\u2019re never going to have an entirely robust domestic market that can generate enough domestic demand.\u201d Wiseman explains. \u201cBy and large, Canadian companies and Canadian entrepreneurs, with some exceptions, aren\u2019t big enough in their thinking.\u201d\n\nAs for thinking big in his own career, it\u2019s been widely speculated that Wiseman is one of the favourites to succeed BlackRock\u2019s co-founder and CEO Larry Fink when he retires. Wiseman, who is at his most comfortable discussing financials, sheepishly dodged my question about how likely it was that a Canadian would soon head up a firm with its US$7 trillion in assets under management.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d put the chances pretty low on a pure probability way.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s worth noting what Canada\u2019s political parties didn\u2019t discuss during the election", "authors": ["David Skok", "Ceo", "Editor-In-Chief Of The Logic."], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mark-Wiseman-min-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
