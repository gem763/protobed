It\u2019s normal for officials to return to the private sector after a few years of pressure-cooker public service, but the Trump administration has seen extraordinary levels of turnover, and the administration\u2019s current ranks are thin and getting thinner. A current White House official described a \u201cwho cares\u201d attitude creeping through the building under Mulvaney\u2019s hands-off management style.\n\nBut others in the White House relish the daily hand-to-hand combat as House Democrats careen toward what looks like an inevitable impeachment vote. Those people \u201cfeed off of the frenzy and want to fight and are kind of excited about another opportunity to fight the \u2018witch hunt\u2019 like they did with Mueller and impeachment,\u201d a former official said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having the time of our lives fighting for the president and this country,\u201d said a senior administration official.\n\nThere is also a concern among Trump alums and other Republicans close to the White House about the current quality of the White House staff. Unlike past officials who occasionally stood up to Trump, redirected his fury or learned which of his whims they could safely ignore, today\u2019s crop of aides are more willing to indulge his basic political needs and desires, they say.\n\n\u201cYour Year Three team is very different from the Year One team in terms of the type of people and how they view their role and how Trump views their role,\u201d said the former official. \u201cHe\u2019s not looking for people to offer contrary opinions or to urge caution or try to restrain him in any way, and the people there don\u2019t view that as their role either.\u201d\n\nThe letter to Erdogan is a case in point, former officials note: It shows that Trump is more directly in charge of what goes on at the White House than ever before.\n\nEarlier in his tenure, when the president was going to write a foreign leader, officials at the State Department and the National Security Council would usually draft a version and the president would try to \u201cinsert some of his Trumpisms into it\u201d before other officials worked with him to get to a letter that everyone was comfortable with, said the former official. But with experienced bureaucratic warriors like Jim Mattis and national security adviser John Bolton now gone, there are few senior foreign policy officials left to stand in Trump\u2019s way.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.
