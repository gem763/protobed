One of the 21 three-storey executive homes became a \u201cclassroom\u201d for almost 50 attendees who registered for a Hard Hat Tour learning experience, led by members of Geranium\u2019s experienced construction team. The tour took guests through a pre-drywalled home where they were informed about the building practices that go into a Geranium home.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt Geranium, we have found that conducting Hard Hat Tours at our under-construction home communities is an excellent opportunity for those interested in purchasing a new home to learn from the individuals who are building them. The tours also demonstrate how we build above the Ontario Building Code with the construction materials and methods we employ.\u201d said Stephanie Lane, Director of Marketing & Sales.\n\nThe tours were led by site superintendents, Guy Marcello and Brent Shaw, who walked the groups through the 3,362 sq. ft. 4-bedroom home, pausing on each floor to speak about insulation, waterproofing, mechanical systems, among other key items installed behind the drywall. Attendees were given a copy of Geranium\u2019s Construction & Craftsmanship booklet containing information about the company\u2019s behind-the-wall building practices along with supporting photos to reinforce what had been on the tour itself.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to see a home during construction and learn from the building professionals was educational. By holding this event, Geranium shows they favour transparency in their business which is a good thing,\u201d said Hard Hat Tour attendee Tarisha S.\n\nNew homes for sale at Edgewood are in West Pickering on Woodview Avenue, south of Finch and west of Altona Road.
