(Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn battling to extend his run as Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has warned voters of many a hazard, from unrest in the occupied territories to nuclear weapons in Iran. In the hours before the polls were to open Tuesday, he warned of another one: election-day sex.\n\nVoting day is a national holiday here and Netanyahu\u2019s ruling Likud party posted a last-minute video beseeching supporters not to waste it by going to the beach, lounging on the couch or \u2014 as suggested by a shot of four feet intertwining beneath the sheets \u2014 engaging in a bit of weekday whoopee. While you\u2019re enjoying yourself, the ad ends, \u201cthe left is getting ready to take over the government.\u201d\n\nIn which the Israeli prime minister urges voters not to stay in bed having sex on election day, lest they emerge to find a leftist government https://t.co/8EtUJssaO0 \u2014 Gregg Carlstrom (@glcarlstrom) September 15, 2019\n\nIt was part of a closing pitch that could seem strange to American political consultants who seek to convey an air of building momentum at the end of a campaign. By contrast, Netanyahu\u2019s final message has been: I\u2019m losing.\n\nThe final public polls showed the race between Netanyahu and former army chief of staff Benny Gantz as too close call or even slightly favoring Likud. (It is illegal to release new survey results in the final three days of the campaign.) But in hopes of motivating his base to go vote for the second time in five months, Netanyahu has been waging an all-out, all-is-lost campaign.\n\nShowing his legendary ability to dominate the narrative, the prime minister was ever-present on national television and radio over the campaign\u2019s final weekend, sparring with the \u201chostile media,\u201d warning of widespread voter fraud in Arab neighborhoods and claiming that the country\u2019s recent run of security and growth was in fact slipping away. Israelis, who have heard the apocalyptic tone before, call it Netanyahu\u2019s \u201coy gevalt\u201d campaign.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu is extremely competent at increasing the turnout of his political base,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. \u201cHe did in 2015, he did in April and he\u2019s trying to do it now.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday night, an hour before Likud\u2019s final rally, a party official announced that the prime minister was canceling his appearance in favor of an emergency campaign meeting. New \u201csecret\u201d data had emerged showing turnout in Likud strongholds would be surpassed by voting in liberal and Arab areas.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu\u2019s hysteria scale has now reached level 20,\u201d said Avigdor Liberman, former defense minister and head of the Yisrael Beiteinu party. Whatever closing arguments Liberman and other candidates may have written for the final days were largely swamped by the prime minister\u2019s blitz.\n\nLiberman then released his own dark video showing a mass rally of Haredim \u2014 the black-clad ultra-Orthodox Jews who are known for high voter turnout, and who have been courted aggressively by Netanyahu. \u201cTomorrow, the Haredim are going to war,\u201d the ad said. \u201cAnd you? You must go out and vote!\u201d\n\nIt was Liberman, a onetime Netanyahu ally, who denied Likud the parliamentary seats it needed to form a government after April\u2019s election, spurring Netanyahu to call for a \u201cdo-over\u201d vote half a year later.\n\nThe unprecedented back-to-back elections have scrambled the usual calculations of Israel\u2019s fractious political system, in part because the fears of low turnout by exhausted voters could be well-founded.\n\nNatanel Bariente, the manager of an optical shop on Ben Yehuda Street in Jerusalem, voted for Netanyahu in April, but now he\u2019s not sure whom to support or whether to bother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been too crazy \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d Bariente said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to the beach and I\u2019m not staying home; I have to work.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the campaign, overlapping with the summer holidays, has also scrambled the usual playbooks. Some candidates stumped on the beaches near Tel Aviv, their black loafers in the sand. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party erected billboards in Cyprus in hopes of catching the eye of vacationing Israelis.\n\nBut in recent days, the simmering campaigns have begun to boil. On Friday, Likud and Democratic Union supporters scuffled during rival parades through Jerusalem\u2019s main market.\n\n\u201cHow can you support Bibi?\u201d Miri Mejdi, 55, asked passing Likud supporters, using Netanyahu\u2019s familiar nickname. Immediately, she was surrounded by a half-dozen campaigners who shook their white banners in her face and screamed that she would turn the country over to leftists and Arabs. \u201cBibi HaMelech! Bibi HaMelech!\u201d one man shouted, \u201cBibi is King.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not left-wing, I\u2019m not right-wing,\u201d said Mejdi, her face flushed, after the storm had passed. She described herself as a longtime Likud voter who had grown disenchanted with the prime minister\u2019s long rule. \u201cNetanyahu has created this fanaticism; it has divided everyone.\u201d\n\nBut one of the Likud campaigners who argued with Mejdi disagreed. Yael Maimon, 57, who came from the town of Gedera to canvass for Netanyahu, credited him with keeping the country safe from terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe remember the bad guys,\u201d Maimon said of the stabbings and bus bombings that once plagued Jerusalem. She dismissed concerns that Netanyahu has been in office too long and that he faces a possible indictment, pending a hearing, on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all fake news,\u201d she said with a smile.\n\nRuth Eglash in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nNetanyahu offers West Bank annexation to right-wing voters ahead of cliffhanger election\n\nIsrael\u2019s do-over election this month may yield another deadlock.
