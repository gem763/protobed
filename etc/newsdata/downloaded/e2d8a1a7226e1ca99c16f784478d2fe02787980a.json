A contract as you know is flexible purely for Asda\u2019s benefit.\n\n\"This flexibility will clearly provide financial savings for the business and is one of the key parts which the business failed to discuss or disclose during the consultation period. This we feel is underhand and deceives your colleagues.\n\n\"Your customers were disgusted with the way your loyal colleagues are being treated and as such have willingly signed the letters and agreed for them to be presented to you. Most of your customers have included a home address or an email address for you to respond directly. The rest have requested that a response is forwarded to my office.\n\n\"In conclusion, Asda used to be a well-respected company where colleagues were proud to wear the Asda badge. This has changed and the change is not one for the better.\n\n\"You have the power and the authority to correct the direction the business has driven Asda to; however, you have an uphill battle to win back the respect and trust your employees had of Asda.\n\n\"It\u2019s time to return to the negotiating table and work with GMB upon pay, terms and conditions to continue to keep the business successful and give your colleagues the respect and pride they used to have.\"\n\n", "description": "The pound slumped before recovering on a volatile\u00a0morning in the currency markets as confidence about the chances of the EU and UK reaching a Brexit deal vacillated during another round of talks today. It comes as Whitehall's spending watchdog warns that a no-deal Brexit would mean delays to goods, more crime and fewer checks on migrants.
