A one-on-one dinner between the two leaders, originally expected to take an hour, lasted nearly 2\u00bd hours.\n\nIndian foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale, briefing the media late on Friday night, said that the talks mostly revolved around trade and terrorism.\n\n\"The two leaders spoke on issues of trade, investment and on enhancing both the trade values as well as trade volumes in order to bridge the trade deficit between the two countries,\" Gokhale said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (right) and Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the Vaan Irai Kal in Mamallapuram on Friday.

It remains to be seen whether either side raised the topic of Kashmir, an issue that remains hotly contested by both countries.\n\nGokhale declined to elaborate on the conversations and did not take questions, saying that the talks were ongoing.\n\nEarlier in the evening, the summit saw plenty of photo opportunities and warm optics as Xi and Modi walked around the monuments in the coastal town of Mamallapuram in southern Tamil Nadu.\n\nModi gave Xi a personal tour, a gesture that recalled their previous informal summit last April, when the Chinese president took his Indian counterpart on a tour of Hubei Museum in Wuhan.\n\nThe leaders spoke at length on Friday evening unaccompanied apart from their interpreters.\n\nAfter visiting two monuments, they sat down to sip coconut water, then toured a third monument and watched a 30-minute cultural performance.", "description": "Kicking off their informal summit in Chennai, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi banked on their personal chemistry in an attempt to iron out recent wrinkles in relations between the two countries.The first part of the Chinese leader's visit, on Friday evening, stretched", "authors": ["Kunal Purohit In Mamallapuram", "Tamil Nadu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u3wBZdS6FaNmHUwGAwa1bQ--~B/aD01NDg7dz05NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_us_228/0a383233d0bb0bd0269c132ea5ae4395", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
