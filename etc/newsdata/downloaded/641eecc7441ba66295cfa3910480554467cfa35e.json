Pat Roberts\u2019 retirement. But many GOP officials fear the controversial Kobach proved himself unelectable when he lost the governor\u2019s race in 2018, and they are concerned that he could hand what is normally a safe Republican seat to Democrats in 2020, when Republicans are trying to protect a three-seat Senate majority.\n\nSenior Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been trying to recruit Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas congressman, into the contest. Several other Republicans \u2014 including GOP Rep. Roger Marshall and state Senate President Susan Wagle \u2014 have entered the race as well. Republican state Treasurer Jake LaTurner dropped out of the Senate race last week to run for the House instead.\n\nThe 51-year-old Thiel, who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention, has emerged as one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken supporters in Silicon Valley. The billionaire has given extensively to Republican causes over the years \u2014 including to the president\u2019s 2020 campaign.\n\nCoulter had long been a Trump backer, but she has recently broken with him, saying the president has failed to keep his promises to crack down on illegal immigration. The president has fired back, calling her a \u201cWacky Nut Job.\u201d\n\nThe fundraising event comes just days before the Sept. 30 third-quarter fundraising deadline. Kobach will have to disclose his campaign fundraising by Oct. 15.", "description": "Kobach is a leading candidate for the Senate seat left open by veteran GOP Sen.
