I was laying in bed and I had the lamp on and I flicked the box open and set to it.\n\n\u2018As I picked [a slice] up, the lamp light caught something.\n\n\u2018I got up and flicked the big light on and it was a big chunk of ham.\u2019\n\nCaroline Parkinson, 55, has been vegan or vegetarian her whole life (Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\nCaroline\u2019s vegetarian pizza with big slice of ham (Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\nCaroline said she was \u2018mortified\u2019 and immediately burst into tears.\n\nShe added: \u2018I thought \u201coh my god\u201d. I got very upset. I could\u2019ve eaten it.\n\n\u2018But it really upset me, the thought of having eaten it. I\u2019d started eating, I think that\u2019s what upset me so much.\n\nSerial killer Dennis Nilsen spent his final hours in 'excruciating pain'\n\n\u2018I know it seems daft but I\u2019ve been vegan or vegetarian my whole life.\u2019\n\nCaroline phoned the Domino\u2019s in Flixton Road, Urmston, where she had ordered her takeaway and was given a refund.\n\nBut she said she is concerned her fears over food cross-contamination haven\u2019t been heard.\n\nShe said: \u2018I understand it was an honest mistake \u2013 but who knows how many thousands of times this has happened before?\n\n\u2018They use open tubs for all their vegetables and meat. I\u2019m concerned they\u2019re using the same gloves for both and some items can get stuck and drop off onto the wrong pizzas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018What if someone has an allergy?\u2019\n\nDomino\u2019s apologised for the \u2018innocent mistake\u2019 and gave Caroline a full refund (Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\nCaroline, who said she has enjoyed Domino\u2019s for years but won\u2019t be going back, is a vegetarian for \u2018health reasons\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018People are judged for going vegan and call it a fad or whatever, but this has been my whole life.\u2019\n\nA Domino\u2019s spokesperson said: \u2018When the customer notified us we immediately apologised for this innocent mistake and collected the pizza to investigate further.\n\n\u2018We issued a full refund to the customer and offered to remake and deliver a fresh order.\u2019\n\nCaroline contacted Metro.co.uk after reading about Patrick Hukins, from Sydney, Australia, who ordered a \u2018plant based pizza\u2019 and got one covered in bacon.\n\nHe said he felt \u2018betrayed\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
