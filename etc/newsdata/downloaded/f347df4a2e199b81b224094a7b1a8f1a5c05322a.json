Operating profit also increased to \u00a320.3million, up from the \u00a318.6million achieved in the first half of last year.\n\nThe AIM-listed group was founded in 2006 to acquire and consolidate UK motor retail businesses and trades under names such as Bristol Street Motors, Macklin Motors, Farnell Jaguar Land Rover and Hughes Group.\n\nThe group's share price is trading up 1.63 per cent or 0.53p to 33.08p today.\n\nVertu will pay an interim dividend of 0.6p a share, up 9.1 per cent from 0.55p in the first half of last year.\n\nRobert Forrester, Vertu's chief executive, said: 'The group performed well in the first half against a more challenging backdrop.\n\nCautiously optimistic: Vertu said it remained on track for the full year, though it added a note of caution amid Brexit uncertainty\n\n'We have an experienced leadership team, well invested systems and operationally we are keeping our discipline by doing all the basics very well, delivering a strong customer experience, and leaving the group in a position to outperform.\n\n'The board is pleased to see continued growth in high margin aftersales revenues and the continued growth in used car volumes. Cost and excellent working capital control has again been exhibited.\n\n'Our omni-channel retailing strategy and discipline around the allocation of capital, coupled with a net cash position, underpins the board's confidence in the future.'\n\nSpeaking to This is Money, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: 'After profit warnings from Lookers and Pendragon no-one will have been expecting too much good news from Vertu\u2019s first-half results but the company has shown great resilience in the face of tough trading conditions.'\n\nHe added: 'Vertu has \u00a3275 million in net assets yet its stock market valuation is just \u00a3122 million. The firm is therefore well positioned to weather the current market conditions and even has the chance to act as a consolidator in a fragmented market over time, to boost its own competitive position.'\n\nRecent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed demand for new cars has fallen 2.5 per cent so far this year.\n\nRival car dealership Pendragon, which trades under the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone brands, recently revealed plans to axe around 300 jobs and shut more than 20 Car Store showrooms as it warned over steep annual losses.", "description": "Vertu said it had seen 'softer' demand from buyers for new cars, with the Brexit-hit pound hitting manufacturers' costs and pushing up prices for consumers.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
