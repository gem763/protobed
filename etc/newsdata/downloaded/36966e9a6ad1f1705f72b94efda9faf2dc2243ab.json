Sure, they\u2019re smaller, and they\u2019ll likely be better than the previous version \u2013 but they aren\u2019t expected until next spring.\n\nThe $179 earphones were merely previewed on screen at the event, where the company talked up the new design that allows the buds to sit flush in your ear, and \u201ccustom sensors, speakers, and battery\u201d for improved performance. It\u2019s hard to say what these will feel like to use, but our own Callum Booth noted the Buds look like mints attached to bits of bicycles\u2019 inner tire tubing.\n\nThe new earphones will feature Adaptive Sound, which will dynamically adjust the volume depending on the noise level of your surroundings. That should save you the trouble of increasing or decreasing the volume manually.\n\nGoogle also mentioned the Buds would deliver reliable performance across longer ranges from your phone \u2013 about three rooms indoors, and up to a whole football field\u2019s length outdoors. You should get about five hours\u2019 playback on a single charge, and the included wireless charging case will allow for up to 24 hours of use until you have to juice it up again.\n\nCredit: Google The Google Pixel Buds get a wireless charging case that allows for 24 hours of use\n\nThe Buds are designed to fit snug in your ear for a good seal \u2013 but there\u2019s also a spatial vent to \u201creduce that plugged-ear feeling\u201d and allow ambient sound through.\n\nThere are also a few tweaks to improve voice calls. There are two mics in each earbud and suppress noise around you, and a voice accelerometer to detect speech through vibrations in your jawbone. Google says that will help make your voice audible even in windy conditions.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to bottle up your enthusiasm until spring 2020 to get your hands on these earphones, which will be available in four colors. You can join the waitlist on this page (which is currently down at the time of writing).\n\nFollow along with our Google hardware event coverage on this page.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "Google's $179 Pixel Buds earphones feature a new design, and adaptive volume control.
