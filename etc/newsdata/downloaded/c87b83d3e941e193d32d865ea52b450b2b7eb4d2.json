Open Tuesday to Friday 10am-5pm, Saturday 10am-5pm, Sunday and Monday 1pm-5pm; free admission.\n\nDistant shores\n\nMore than 10 million people have bid farewell to Ireland down the centuries and the Irish diaspora stretches all across the world. EPIC, The Irish Immigration Museum, is a museum devoted to telling the story of the huge numbers who left, through engaging interactive displays, including a Whispering Library of the words of some renowned Irish writers. Admission \u20ac15; open daily 10am-6.45pm.\n\nCollege life\n\nThe leafy confines of Trinity College are home to a number of sights, the most noteworthy being the chance to see the Book of Kells, a priceless ninth-century illuminated manuscript of The Gospels, on display in the institution\u2019s Harry Potter-esque Long Library. Admission \u20ac11-13; open Monday to Saturday, 8.30am-5.30pm, Sundays, 9.30am-5pm.\n\nFor art\u2019s sake\n\nThe Royal Hospital Kilmainham was built in 1680 and modelled on Les Invalides in Paris. Nowadays it\u2019s the imposing backdrop for the Irish Museum of Modern Art and its impressive collection of over 3,500 works by Irish and International artists, including Lucian Freud and Sean Scully, dating predominately from the 1940s onwards. Admission free; open Tuesday to Friday 11.30am-5.30pm, Saturdays 10am-5.30pm, Sundays 12-5.30pm. Closed Mondays.\n\nGolden hour\n\nDublin may be known as the home of Guinness, but it also has a long history of whiskey making and recent times have seen a profusion of new boutique distilleries spring up. Several are dotted around the historic Liberties neighbourhood, known in the 18th and 19th century as the Golden Triangle. A few choice examples include The Teeling Distillery, the distinctive glass spire of Pearse Lyons set in a former church, and Guinness\u2019s new Roe & Co Distillery, housed in its former power station on St. James\u2019s Street. Opening times vary.\n\nGeorgian grit\n\nThe Georgian grandeur of 14 Henrietta Street offers a compelling, if bleak, insight into life in a 19th-century Dublin tenement, with interactive guided tours of this new museum. One of the city\u2019s most prestigious addresses in the 18th century, by the turn of the 20th century it had become home to 100 souls living in cramped, unhealthy conditions. Admission \u20ac9. Tours available Wednesday to Saturday 10am-4pm, Sundays 12-4pm, closed Mondays and Tuesdays.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nWith its bosky views out over St Stephen\u2019s Green, The Shelbourne Hotel is a local institution \u2013 the first Constitution of the Republic of Ireland was drawn up here in Room 112 and it marked its 195th anniversary this year in grand style with a \u20ac40m facelift. Doubles from \u20ac349, B&B.\n\nA recently renovated Victorian building close to the banks of the Grand Canal, The Wilder Townhouse is an intimate stylish option within walking distance of St. Stephen\u2019s Green. Doubles from \u20ac130, room only.\n\nThe Hendrick Hotel is something new, a street-art themed hotel in the rejuvenated Smithfield district with a sceney, urban edge. Rooms are small but comfortable and the public spaces are adorned with over 270 pieces of graffiti and other art curated by Irish street artist, James Earley. Doubles from \u20ac129, room only.\n\nThe Generator on the nearby Smithfield Square is a great budget option with beds in shared dormitories from \u20ac16 per night or \u20ac50 for a private room.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThe Fumbally is one of Dublin\u2019s classic brunching and lunching spots, a large airy space with a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern-oriented menu.\n\nExpertly baked breads and pastries are on offer at Bread 41, as well as salads and more substantial lunch dishes with an emphasis on pickled and foraged ingredients.\n\nYou can eat some of Dublin\u2019s best, and most refined, fish and chips washed down by organic and biodynamic wines sitting at the counter of the small, but perfectly formed, Fish Shop.\n\nThe contiguous streets of Camden, Aungier and South Great George\u2019s Street are at the heart of Dublin\u2019s dining scene. Book in advance for a table at Pickle, arguably Ireland\u2019s best Indian restaurant, which specialises in North Indian cuisine.\n\nLatest hot table, Uno Mas, has a distinctly Iberian air with the likes of red mullet rice and squid a la plancha, while Pi Pizza serves some of the city\u2019s best wood-fired pizzas.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nTemple Bar is strictly for tourists. James Joyce\u2019s most famous literary protagonist Leopold Bloom mused in Ulysses that a good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub. For those who don\u2019t want to, Mulligans is widely acknowledged as serving one of the best pints of Guinness in Dublin and is loaded with atmosphere.\n\nThe aptly named The Virgin Mary is Dublin\u2019s one and only non-alcoholic bar serving an array of inventive cocktails and draught nitro-coffee.\n\nDublin has experienced an explosion of good coffee. 3FE was one of the first proponents and still one of the best.\n\nDubliners have been meeting and gossiping over tea, coffee and its must-order sticky buns at the landmark Bewley\u2019s for 180 years.\n\nThe Cobblestone in Smithfield is where to go to hear some traditional Irish music, which is more about the vibrant community of musicians who regularly drop in to play than performing for tourists.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nBrown Thomas is Dublin\u2019s answer to Selfridges and shares the same owners, so expect designer labels and high prices.\n\nIrish design given a more contemporary spin is another burgeoning retail trope with the Irish Design Shop and Stable of Ireland being two of the best examples. The latter employs knitters and weavers to update Irish classics with a tasteful, modern twist.\n\nThe former Georgian home of Lord Powerscourt is the ornate backdrop for the Powerscourt Townhouse Centre, with numerous boutiques and restaurants set around an internal courtyard.\n\nDublin Flea takes place on the last Sunday of every month and is currently popping up at The Digital Hub on Thomas Street, with its interesting mix of vintage, antique and independent sellers.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nDublin\u2019s Georgian streetscapes are one of its finest architectural boasts \u2013 gracious, 18th-century townhouses and squares are dotted both north and south of the River Liffey. St. Stephen\u2019s Green is the largest of its five Georgian squares and other fine examples include Merrion Square, the terraces of North Great George\u2019s Street and the Custom House, built in 1791.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nEuros.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nEnglish is used on a daily basis but you will also notice all official signs and public services displaying information using Gaelic \u2013 referred to by locals as Irish.\n\nShould I tip?\n\n10-12 per cent for good service.\n\nWhat\u2019s the average flight time from the UK?\n\nDublin can usually be reached within an hour from most UK airports, which all have good connections.\n\nPublic transport\n\nCentral Dublin is easily walkable \u2013 for longer distances there is a bus network as well as two tram lines called the LUAS. The Dublin Area Rapid Transit line is a light railway skirting the coast serving seaside suburbs north and south of Dublin Bay. Dublin Bikes is another popular mode of transport.\n\nBest view\n\nThe Great South Wall is one of Dublin\u2019s lesser known gems. Jutting out into Dublin Bay and built in 1795, you can walk its four-mile length to the pillar-box red Poolbeg Lighthouse and gaze back at the city.\n\nInsider tip\n\nWild swimming might be all the rage these days, but Dubliners have been at it for decades. Hop on the DART to Sandycove and the Forty Foot, immortalised by James Joyce in Ulysses, and take the freezing, but life-affirming, plunge into the icy waters of the Irish sea alongside its many devotees.", "description": "Spliced in two by the lazy flow of the River Liffey, the Irish capital has an easy, welcoming charm that gets under your skin.
