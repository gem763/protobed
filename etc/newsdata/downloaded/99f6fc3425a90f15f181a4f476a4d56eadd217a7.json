That hack, according to collusion truthers, and the subsequent release of damaging emails exchanged between top Democratic Party officials was central to Vladimir Putin\u2019s scheme to sway the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.\n\nBut the evidence to support this widely accepted claim is sketchy at best and appears to be under appropriate scrutiny by prosecutors now examining the origins of the FBI\u2019s pre-election investigation into the Trump campaign for \u201ccolluding\u201d with Russia.\n\nAccording to the transcript of a July call between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president, Trump raised the issue of \u201cCrowdStrike\u201d and suggested Ukraine might be in possession of the \u201cserver,\u201d a reference to the DNC server.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with the whole situation with Ukraine, with CrowdStrike. The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation.\u201d\n\nTo say the least.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Ties to Democrats\n\nWhile lawmakers and pundits on the Left and NeverTrump Right breezed past Trump\u2019s mention of CrowdStrike\u2014either out of subterfuge or ignorance\u2014it is significant.\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity firm with strong ties to the Democratic Party. After the DNC server was hacked in early 2016, Perkins Coie, a politically connected law firm, hired CrowdStrike on behalf of the DNC to find out who was behind the intrusion. (Perkins Coie is the same law firm that hired Fusion GPS on behalf of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign to dig up Russia-related dirt on Team Trump before the election.)\n\nThat isn\u2019t the extent of CrowdStrike\u2019s dubious political ties. Its co-founder, Moscow-born Dmitri Alperovitch, is associated with the Clinton Foundation; in 2015, CrowdStrike received $100 million in funding from Google whose chairman, Eric Schmidt, was a generous supporter of Hillary Clinton. CrowdStrike\u2019s president is Shawn Henry, who headed up the FBI\u2019s cybercrimes division during the Obama Administration when Robert Mueller was director.\n\nAccording to an October 2016 profile in Esquire, at the same time, the Obama Justice Department was concocting the Trump-Russia collusion ruse, Alperovitch and Henry were working with top Justice officials on cyber \u201cwar games.\u201d In March 2016\u2014as the DNC email system allegedly was compromised by the Russians\u2014Alperovitch and Henry organized \u201cfour teams of ten people\u2014representing the government, the private sector, European and Australian allies\u201d for the exercise. (Another participant included a former member of GCHQ, the British intelligence agency working with former CIA Director John Brennan in 2016 on the Russian collusion scheme.)\n\nAmong the officials working with CrowdStrike on the exercise was John Carlin, Mueller\u2019s former chief of staff and then head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division. Carlin facilitated the October 2016 FISA warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page; he also received regular briefings from then-deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe on both the Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia collusion probe. (Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general at the center of the so-called whistleblower controversy, worked directly for Carlin in 2016 and 2017.)\n\nProbably just a coincidence, right?\n\nThen, in June 2016\u2014around the same time Christopher Steele began compiling his anti-Trump dossier and James Comey\u2019s FBI was investigating Trump campaign aides\u2014Alperovitch authored a report that concluded hackers tied to the Kremlin were responsible for the DNC server breach.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWho Are You Going to Believe?\n\nThat report remains the only piece of evidence to support the claim that Putin apparatchiks stole thousands of emails from the Democrats just months before the presidential election. But the document isn\u2019t just part of political lore; it was legitimized both by the FBI and the CIA as the Obama Administration attempted to buttress its phony narrative about a conspiracy between Trump and Putin to steal the election from Hillary Clinton. The server, however, was never inspected by U.S. law enforcement or any other government agency.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017, former FBI Director James Comey admitted that the DNC refused to surrender the server to his agents.\n\nSenator Richard Burr (R-N.C.): Did the FBI request access to those devices to perform forensics on them? Comey: [coughs] Yes, we did. Burr: Were you given access to do the forensics? Comey: We were not. A highly respected private company got access and shared with us what they saw there.\n\nWhen pressed by Burr, Comey admitted that the DNC denied \u201cmultiple\u201d requests by the FBI for the device. \u201cUltimately it was agreed to that the private company [Crowdstrike] would share with us what they saw.\u201d\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nBut Comey wasn\u2019t the only top Obama official to take the word of a company working for the very same law firm that also was coordinating the Steele dossier and planting negative news articles about Trump weeks before the election.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan lifted much of the CrowdStrike paper for his infamous January 2017 intelligence community assessment about Russian election interference. \u201cRussia\u2019s intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including targets associated with both major US political parties,\u201d the report claimed.\n\nThe CrowdStrike report even made an appearance in the Mueller investigation, specifically, its prosecution of Roger Stone. But when Stone\u2019s defense team wanted the unredacted forensic reports that supported CrowdStrike\u2019s conclusion, Team Mueller admitted they didn\u2019t have them because CrowdStrike performed the redactions in-house.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the government allowed CrowdStrike and the Democratic Party\u2019s legal counsel to decide what it could and could not see in reports on Russian hacking,\u201d reported Real Clear Investigation\u2019s Aaron Mate in a lengthy expos\u00e9 on CrowdStrike earlier this year. Mate questioned the government\u2019s reliance on a \u201cpotentially biased and politically conflicted source like CrowdStrike.\u201d\n\nBad Actors Exposed at Last?\n\nDespite the latest outrage and hysteria over Trump\u2019s otherwise innocuous conversation with Zelensky, the president is not backing down. It\u2019s clear he is committed to exposing the bad actors behind the biggest political scandal in American history, which is how the world\u2019s most powerful law enforcement and intelligence apparatus was weaponized against him to sabotage his campaign and derail his presidency.\n\nTrump has reason to believe Ukraine played some early, significant role in the hoax: As I reported on Wednesday, Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s emissary to the country during the final years of his presidency, was a key figure in the collusion operation in 2016 and early 2017.\n\nThe Justice Department also confirmed that it is investigating Ukraine\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cA Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,\u201d a department spokeswoman told The Federalist this week.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s shady business dealings in Ukraine aren\u2019t the only scandals Democrats have to worry about right now. Finally exposing all the fabricated elements of the Russia collusion hoax, including the CrowdStrike report, will be a far greater threat to their electoral chances in 2020.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1156364249-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
