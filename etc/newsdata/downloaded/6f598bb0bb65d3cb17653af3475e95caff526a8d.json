It was titled, \u201cParents: What are your real thoughts about having kids? Would you still have them, after everything you\u2019ve been through?\u201d But I paused. I knew there would be a lot of \u201cParenting is so hard, but I wouldn\u2019t trade my kids for anything!\u201d responses, but surely some had regrets. Out of curiosity, I clicked through.\n\nThe post was from Reddit user u/olivesucks, who had always planned to have kids with their husband. But now, they\u2019re rethinking that choice: \u201cI know there\u2019s a positive and negative side on everything, but with your mind and experience today: Would you go back in time and \u2018cancel\u2019 the having kid(s) part?\u201d\n\nAlthough there were plenty of the expected \u201cmy kid(s) are the best thing that ever happened to me\u201d responses, there were also several who would undo their parenthood if they could. A couple of parents who said they wouldn\u2019t do it again because of how drastically their lives have been taken over, sure, but also one parent, u/Shoonasasi, whose child suffers from mental illness and brain disorders:\n\nWithout help, he\u2019s going to either end up in prison or dead, and it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking to know he\u2019s got no chance unless we win the lottery or sign over our rights and give him up to the government. If I could go back in time I wouldn\u2019t have had him, if only to save him from the life he\u2019s forced to live now.\n\nAnd then there was a response, from u/dieomama (and echoed by others), who said they would choose differently today \u2014 not because of their experience as parents but because of what we\u2019re leaving for our kids:\n\nLooking at the facts, there is a high probability that the climate crisis will make their lives miserable before they reach 30. I regret not being better informed at the time I had a child. If I had informed myself properly I would have refrained from bringing someone into this world. I can still hope for the best. The climate models are not 100% accurate, but still, things are not looking good for the future. I\u2019m a scientist by training and the science seems solid.\n\nWhether or not to raise children is such a personal decision, and whether or not there may be cause for regret is personal and situational, too. Contentment or regret can come from the quality of our lives, the quality of our children\u2019s lives or what we imagine the future will hold for them.", "description": "When I saw this post on Reddit the other day, I almost skimmed right past it.
