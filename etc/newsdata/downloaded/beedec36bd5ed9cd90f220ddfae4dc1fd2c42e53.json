A few counties in the Sierra Nevada foothills and the Central Valley saw power cuts earlier in the day. But the Bay Area outages had been pushed back all day until authorities were sure dry, gusty Diablo winds were on the way.\n\nPG&E earlier cut power to 500,000 homes and businesses in northern and central counties.\n\nThe utility says the precautionary cuts are to prevent the winds from toppling power lines and sparking deadly wildfires like one \u2014 blamed on PG&E equipment \u2014 that killed 85 people in November.\n\nThe new cuts will bring the total number of homes and businesses affected to about 734,000, or perhaps two million people.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric has delayed shutting off power to the San Francisco Bay area because expected dangerous, gusty winds haven\u2019t yet materialized.\n\nPG&E cut power to about 500,000 customers in northern and central California counties Wednesday and warned that it planned to expand the outages to about 250,000 other customers later in the day.\n\nBut by late Wednesday night, PG&E\u2019s second phase of shutoffs had only extended to the Sierra Nevada foothills and the central valley.\n\nSpokesman Jeff Smith says it\u2019s unclear when the Bay Area will be hit because it depends on the weather, which authorities are watching closely.\n\nPG&E is staging an unprecedented, widespread blackout because of extreme fire danger, including winds that could blow down power lines and spark deadly wildfires.\n\n___\n\n7:10 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric says Diablo winds are to blame for extreme fire weather that has prompted it to shut off power to more than 1 million people.\n\nThe hot, dry winds that swept into Northern California from the northeast are seasonal. But PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel says they are also part of a California-wide weather system that will produce Santa Ana winds in the south in the next day or so.\n\nStrenfel says such events have historically caused the most destructive wildfires in state history.\n\nPG&E on Wednesday began shutting off electricity to customers in 34 counties where predicted winds might knock down power lines and cause fires. Outages are affecting about 500,000 homes and businesses in the north and central valley. The company expects to cut power Wednesday night to more than 200,000 additional customers in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n___\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. says it\u2019s already been able to restore service to about 44,000 customers after it cut power to a million people because of high winds that create a high fire danger.\n\nCompany Vice President Sumeet Singh said Wednesday that the company identified a way to reroute electricity and restore some service.\n\nHe says winds have slowed in some parts of California\u2019s Sierra Foothills, and the utility is trying to determine whether it can bring back service to the Humboldt area. Doing so requires performing safety inspections along the route by helicopter and on the ground.\n\nSingh says PG&E is hoping to be able to bring back service to another 60,000 to 80,000 customers as soon as it can.\n\nStill, the company plans to cut power to another 250,000 customers Wednesday night.\n\n___\n\n5:20 p.m.\n\nAuthorities are asking the public to be kind to frontline utility workers in California as anger mounts against Pacific Gas and Electric over a power shutdown.\n\nPG&E is cutting power to customers in 34 counties as dry, gusty winds create dangerous wildfires conditions.\n\nThe utility\u2019s faulty equipment was to blame for a deadly fire a year ago that killed 85 people and nearly wiped out the town of Paradise.\n\nThe California Highway Patrol says a PG&E truck had a window shattered by a bullet Tuesday evening on Colusa County. The driver wasn\u2019t hurt.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether the truck was targeted. The shooting occurred hours before the power shutoffs began.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle says security was increased at a PG&E office in Oroville after an angry customer threw eggs at a window.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nAuthorities are asking the public to be kind to frontline utility workers in California as anger mounts against Pacific Gas and Electric over a power shutdown.\n\nPG&E is cutting power to customers in 34 counties as dry, gusty winds create dangerous wildfires conditions.\n\nThe utility\u2019s faulty equipment was to blame for a deadly fire a year ago that killed 85 people and nearly wiped out the town of Paradise.\n\nSacramento\u2019s KCRA-TV says the California Highway Patrol is investigating an incident Tuesday in Colusa County in which an occupied PG&E truck was damaged in a possible shooting before the shutdown began.

San Francisco County is exempted.\n\nThe utility relies on its own weather forecasters when deciding whether to cut power.\n\n___\n\n12:39 p.m.\n\nPeople in Moraga, California, were lining up at gas stations to fill their tanks and at the town\u2019s only grocery store to buy food before possibly having their electricity turned off.\n\nShelves also were also being emptied of emergency supplies at the town hardware store before Pacific Gas and Electric shut down power to help prevent wildfires.\n\nHardware and Lumber store owner Bill Snider said he sold 500 flashlights Tuesday and the shop ran out of batteries and coolers, even pricey ones that cost as much as $400.\n\nCustomer Elma Lear of Lafayette said she had to purchase $40 worth of beeswax candles from a home decor shop because there were none left at the hardware.\n\n__\n\n12:25 p.m.\n\nAt Friedman\u2019s Home Improvement store in Sonoma, California, employees with flashlights and head lamps took customers into the darkened store to buy batteries, power cords, flashlights and other items needed to get them through a widespread power blackout to help prevent wildfires.\n\nContractor Rick Lachmiller came to Friedman\u2019s early Wednesday to buy extension cords for his generator after his home lost power around 1 a.m.\n\nHe said he was upset and feels PG&E jumped the gun on the outage, since it was not even windy Wednesday morning, He also said the utility did not provide enough warning.\n\nPG&E spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said that because of the way the electric grid is laid out, some customers may be affected by the outage even though they\u2019re not experiencing extreme weather conditions in their location.\n\nStore co-owner Barry Friedman said many of his employees had childcare issues since most schools were closed Wednesday.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s largest utility says as many as 2 million people will remain without power at least through Thursday.\n\n___\n\n11:40 a.m.\n\nRetirees John and Greta Maltbie say they prepared for a widespread power blackout intended to prevent wildfires in California by buying bottled water, getting cash and filling their car with gas.\n\nBut the couple in suburban Sacramento forgot to charge their cellphones and were unable to get information on the Pacific Gas and Electric website, which was down after being overloaded with visitors.\n\nThe Maltbies were among three people at an air-conditioned tent set up by PG&E in the parking lot of a church.
