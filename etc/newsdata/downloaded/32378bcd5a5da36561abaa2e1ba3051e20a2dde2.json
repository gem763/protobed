Daniel Montsion have raised doubts about receipts used to prove the Ottawa Police Service purchased the \"assault\" gloves the officer was wearing the day he arrested Abdirahman Abdi.\n\nMontsion was wearing the gloves when he punched Abdi several times on July 24, 2016. Abdi was pronounced dead in hospital the next day.\n\nMontsion has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in connection with Abdi's death.\n\nOn Sept. 11, defence counsel Solomon Friedman filed a series of receipts and invoices indicating the supervisor of the direct action response team (DART), Sandra Sparling, had approved the purchase of 13 pairs of Oakley assault gloves between 2015 and 2016.\n\nFriedman called the receipts \"conclusive\" proof that the force considered the gloves approved protective gear.\n\nOttawa police Const. Daniel Montsion is facing charges of manslaughter, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in the July 2016 death of Abdirahman Abdi. (CBC)\n\nA matter of interpretation\n\nBut the Crown has zeroed in on a handwritten note attached to an invoice for 11 pairs of gloves, the only reference to \"protective\" gear among the receipts.\n\nFriedman told the court he believes the note reads \"protective expense, DART.\"\n\nCrown attorney Philip Perlmutter argued earlier this week that it actually says \"protective eyewear,\" and may be unrelated to the purchase of the gloves.\n\nThe purchase total also doesn't match the amount listed on a corresponding invoice.\n\nPerlmutter planned to formally ask the defence for more evidence to clear the matter up. Instead, the defence and the Crown tried to resolve the confusion out of court with an agreed statement of facts on Tuesday.\n\nWhen they couldn't see eye to eye, the Crown withdrew its complaints altogether Wednesday morning.\n\nFriedman said he was \"baffled\" over why they couldn't come to an agreement, and said the defence is concerned the matter has been left unresolved.\n\nThe gloves Const. Daniel Montsion wore the day of Abdirahman Abdi's arrest were entered into evidence as part of the officer's manslaughter trial.
