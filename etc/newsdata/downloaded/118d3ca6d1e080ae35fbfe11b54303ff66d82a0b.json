That will change as they gravitate to wind and solar projects, which tap debt markets backed by project financing for as much as 95% of their cost, he said.\n\nThe shift will create huge amounts of surplus cash that majors can return to investors as they increasingly tap pension funds and other lenders for lower-risk renewable projects, said Rystad. It underscores the massive changes oil and gas giants will need to undertake as they transition to wind and solar projects, the fastest-growing sources of energy.\n\nRead about how Big Oil\u2019s asset sales offload carbon footprints to new firms\n\n\u201cShareholders will be drowned in capital paid back by energy majors in the next 20 years,\u201d said Rystad, whose Oslo-based consultancy gained prominence for being among the first to identify the market-changing potential of U.S. shale and produces widely-followed oil production data and analytic.\n\n\u201cBasically the whole energy sector needs to decapitalize and to increase leverage,\u201d he said.\n\nMajor oil companies are poised to do a record number of clean-energy deals this year, with Royal Dutch Shell Plc leading the pack, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF last month. So far this year, they\u2019ve done about 70 deals in sectors including solar, wind and biofuels, close to surpassing the total for all of last year, the data show. A Bloomberg Intelligence index of global integrated majors is down 23% in the past year.\n\nGuaranteed Returns\n\nInvestment in upstream oil and gas projects tends to be high-return but risky as the results aren\u2019t always apparent at the outset. In contrast, renewable projects follow a model more closely aligned with utilities, in which power-purchase agreements with grids or end-users offer relatively low but guaranteed returns sought by banks and pension funds.\n\nWhile owning a solar farm won\u2019t provide the kind of returns attractive to Big Oil\u2019s investors, these companies can tap their engineering and operational expertise to develop projects and sell them when they\u2019re complete or de-risked, Rystad said. They can also find new profit streams closer to the end-user by adding bespoke services to the energy they provide, he said.\n\n\u201cClearly Chevron and Exxon and everybody have ambitions to be an energy major 30 or 40 or 50 years from now,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrent energy majors are only 15% debt, but the future energy majors will be 85% debt. That\u2019s why it will change the capital structure of the industry.\u201d\n\nA middle ground between the two can be found in the shale industry, Rystad said. Because shale development resembles manufacturing, with almost no dry holes encountered, and because companies can hedge their commodity price risk, its capital structure is about 30% to 50% equity, with the rest coming from debt, Rystad said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for Big Oil companies to start to invest much more in shale, change their capital structure gradually and then go further into renewables,\u201d he said.\n\n(Updates with index performance in fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Kelly Gilblom.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net;Sharon Cho in Singapore at ccho28@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Jasmine Ng\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Shareholders of global oil giants will be \u201cdrowned\u201d in cash from dividends and buybacks for the next 20 years as the firms shift their capital structure to finance renewable projects, according to Rystad Energy.Majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have traditionally had to", "authors": ["Dan Murtaugh", "Sharon Cho"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WWNczQ7jReJsywZuIl6QXg--~B/aD03NTQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/028e1599bd61e662801ce3432f3697c0", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
