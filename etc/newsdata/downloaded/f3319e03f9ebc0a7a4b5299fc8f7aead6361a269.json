They expressed concern that Facebook \u201cis on track to undo the great strides [its] product teams have made in integrity over the last two years\u201d.\n\n\u201cMisinformation affects us all,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOur current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands.\u201d\n\nFacebook has come under fire in recent weeks after the company rescinded an internal policy in late September, exempting political advertising from factchecking.\n\nPreviously the social network banned adverts containing \u201cdeceptive, false or misleading content\u201d but later clarified this policy does not apply to paid advertisements from politicians.\n\nPoliticians including the senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have publicly spoken out against this policy. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support of the employees who spoke out against the policy on Monday, calling them \u201ccourageous\u201d.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) Courageous workers at Facebook are now standing up to the corporation\u2019s leadership, challenging Zuckerberg\u2019s disturbing policy on allowing paid, targeted disinformation ads in the 2020 election: https://t.co/jDJE7WplVy\n\nSigned by a few hundred people, the letter represents just a portion of Facebook\u2019s workforce of more than 39,000 full-time employees. But it represents the latest example of tech employees organizing to fight company policies they see as unethical.\n\nIn August, a group of employees known as Googlers for Human Rights posted a public petition urging Google to cease its contract with US Customs and Border Protection and in 2018 tens of thousands of Google employees walked out of campuses across the US to protest sexual harassment policies.\n\nSince 2018, thousands of workers at Amazon have staged internal actions including a walkout in 2019 to protest the company\u2019s impact on climate change. In February 2019 workers at Microsoft pushed the company to cancel a $480m contract with the US army.\n\nThe Facebook workers called for specific changes including holding political ads to the same standards as other advertising, stronger design measures to better distinguish political ads from other content, and restricting targeting for political ads. The employees also recommended imposing a silence period ahead of elections and imposing spend caps for politicians.\n\nFacebook did not respond to request for comment.", "description": "A letter to Mark Zuckerberg says the exemption is \u201ca threat to what FB stands for\u201d and called for the same standards as other adverts", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b96c23c97eed845447a9acddc94d51fcfa95f4e8/0_0_3742_2245/master/3742.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a46670932d28cf4b1826ce42c64d58e0", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
