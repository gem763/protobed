REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nThe mustachioed hard-liner\u2019s efforts to add bite to the bark of U.S. foreign policy met stiff resistance from a White House leery of foreign entanglements and came to an abrupt halt on Tuesday when Trump announced he had fired him.\n\nTrump said he and others in the administration had disagreed strongly with many of Bolton\u2019s suggestions.\n\nBut Bolton, 70, can lay claim to one clear victory during his tenure.\n\nHanging on a wall in his West Wing office was a memento of that achievement: a framed copy of Trump\u2019s order last year to pull the United States out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nRight next to it hung a cartoon mocking the agreement, which was designed to make it more difficult for Iran to develop a nuclear bomb in exchange for international sanctions relief. The Trump administration said the accord secured by President Barack Obama and other world powers did not go far enough in curtailing Iran\u2019s activities.\n\nBolton\u2019s choice of decor reflected his disdain for the deal and his relentless focus on trying to isolate Tehran and cripple its economy by reimposing tight sanctions.\n\nBolton became national security adviser on April 9, 2018 and the next month Trump abandoned the Iran deal, meeting a promise he had made as a presidential candidate, which other wary West Wing advisers had persuaded him to put off.\n\nBolton changed that dynamic quickly. In an interview with Reuters last year, he said he reassured Trump that his instincts were right and that he could ignore the pleas and warnings of moderates and European allies to stay in the deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world,\u201d Bolton said he told Trump in arguing for withdrawal from the pact. \u201cThe Western alliance is not going to fall apart.\u201d\n\nSUPER-HAWK\n\nIn Washington\u2019s community of foreign policy veterans, Bolton has been a super-hawk for decades, whether as a tough-talking U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush or as a prominent analyst on Fox News.\n\nCritics call him an ideologue and a warmonger who retaliates against dissenting views, while allies say he is an intellectual and a shrewd operator committed to ensuring the supremacy of U.S. power.\n\nOver the years, Bolton has advocated for regime change in a number of countries, including Iran and North Korea, opposed direct negotiations with both and said the United States should stage pre-emptive attacks against their nuclear facilities.\n\nHe played a central role in the hardening of U.S. policy toward Venezuela\u2019s socialist government over the past year, pushing other countries to help speed up a transition of power in the South American nation.\n\nBolton did appear to soften some of his bellicose positions, at least in public, after becoming national security adviser, saying he was happy to follow the president\u2019s lead.\n\nThat kept him temporarily in good graces with Trump, who has made improved ties with both North Korea and Russia a centerpiece of his foreign policy, and who does not like being overshadowed by his staff.\n\nBolton was widely believed to have favored a planned U.S. air strike on Iran earlier this year in retaliation for the downing of a U.S. surveillance drone, an action Trump called off at the last minute.\n\nAnd Bolton had argued against the president\u2019s suggestions of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership and advocated a tougher approach on Russia and, more recently, Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Trump has spoken admiringly of Vladimir Putin, Bolton never did that, and accused the Russian president of lying about Moscow\u2019s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.\n\nBolton opposed easing of a wide range of sanctions on Russia and was instrumental in Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw last month from a 1987 accord that banned intermediate-range missiles because of what Washington charged was Moscow\u2019s deployment of prohibited nuclear-capable cruise missiles, an allegation Russia denied.", "description": "John Bolton was always an odd fit to be U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser: a conservative hawk who advocated for regime change in North Korea and Iran, supported the Iraq war and favored a tough stance toward Russia.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428440310&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF89222", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
