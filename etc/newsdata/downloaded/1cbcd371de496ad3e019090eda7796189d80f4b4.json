He needed a new business model.\n\nRwandan Joseline Iradukunda poses next to her \"Move\" app-driven ride-hailing service Volkswagen Polo in Kigali, Rwanda. September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Jean Bizimana\n\nStudy after study showed the same thing: there was no demand for new cars. Low purchasing power and a lack of financing put them out of the reach of most Africans, while competition from used imports gave buyers a cheaper alternative.\n\nSo Schaefer is placing a $50 million bet on a new business built around ride-hailing and car-sharing. And VW is using Rwanda \u2013 a small central African nation with a growing reputation for innovation \u2013 as its laboratory.\n\n\u201cIt was almost an industrial experiment,\u201d Schaefer told Reuters.\n\nThe German carmaker\u2019s project was launched with some fanfare last December in the capital Kigali but since then scant information has been disclosed about how it has progressed.\n\nVW told Reuters the app for its \u201cMove\u201d ride-service now had over 23,000 registered users in Kigali. However only around 2,200 of those are active users - a fairly modest uptake so far in the city of 850,000 people.\n\nIn July, the ride-hailing service averaged 384 rides per day, a figure VW said it wanted to double.\n\nIt may be a longshot but, if successful, the Rwandan gamble could help plot a future course for Volkswagen, and others, in Africa\u2019s challenging auto sector by securing a foothold in the region\u2019s rapidly growing ride-hailing space.\n\nIndustry experts are divided on the merits of the plan, with some questioning whether VW can compete with the likes of Uber and Bolt in Africa or, in light of those companies\u2019 losses, if it should even try.\n\nWhile VW sees Kigali is an ideal test ground, offering a data sample that\u2019s statistically significant at a reasonable cost, critics say the city - where Uber and Bolt are absent - is not an accurate gauge of conditions in bigger markets.\n\nSchaefer cautioned that the experiment was still in its early stages, adding he\u2019d like to give the business model a two-year test run before assessing it.\n\n\u201cLuckily our headquarters leaves us alone. They just say, do what you need to do.\u201d\n\nAnd though it hasn\u2019t yet set a timeframe, Volkswagen told Reuters it was already looking to Ghana in West Africa and Ethiopia, a rapidly reforming market of some 100 million people, as initial targets for an expansion of its mobility business.\n\nADAPT TO SURVIVE\n\nGlobal automakers like VW, Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Peugeot, are waking up to the potential in Africa, where incomes and consumer aspirations are rising.\n\nBut the region accounted for less than 1% of global new passenger car sales last year, making it hard to justify investing in local manufacturing and assembly.\n\nVW\u2019s ride-hailing cars are assembled in Kigali at a new $20 million plant that also produces vehicles for the relatively few customers able to afford a brand new Polo, Passat or Teramont.\n\nEmployers can also access VWs to transport their workers, and VW plans to launch car-sharing, where customers can drive themselves and are charged for the time they\u2019ve used a vehicle.\n\nAll those vehicles are owned by VW, which after a year or two of service will sell them onto the second-hand market at a price more accessible to average Rwandans. VW is also opening certified service centres.\n\nVW hopes combining all these businesses - new car sales, ride-hailing, car-sharing, used car sales, parts and service - can make the company\u2019s investment in Rwanda worthwhile.\n\n\u201cIf we were to focus only on selling new cars, in a few years we can close business,\u201d said Michaella Rugwizangoga, CEO of Volkswagen Mobility Solutions. \u201cWe had to think bigger.\u201d\n\nSchaefer believes VW will eventually need around 800 cars on the road in the city for ride-hailing and sharing. The company will begin introducing its E-Golf electric vehicle into the mobility fleet next year.\n\nFUTURE OR FAILURE?\n\nJoseline Iradukunda quit her old job as a secretary in a law firm to go to work behind the wheel of a new Polo for VW\u2019s app-driven ride-hailing service. The 25-year-old now spends her days plying the hilly, winding streets of Kigali.\n\n\u201cThis car works 24/7,\u201d she said proudly, parking near the city\u2019s beehive-shaped convention centre to pick up a client, one of roughly a dozen she will transport during her shift.\n\nJean-Jacques Koffi, a Kigali-based entrepreneur from Ivory Coast, is a regular Move customer.\n\n\u201cDuring the week, I use it twice a day,\u201d he said as Iradukunda drove him to his office. \u201cYou know it\u2019s a brand-new car. It\u2019s comfortable.\u201d\n\nRwanda has already earned a reputation for innovation - from a cashless public transport system to medical drones. The city\u2019s budding IT sector allowed VW to develop its app locally.\n\nVW\u2019s project is hailed by some as ahead of its time.\n\n\u201cThis truly is a fantastic case study for future mobility in progressive frontier economies,\u201d said Martyn Davies, managing director for emerging markets at Deloitte.\n\nBut others, like Justin Coetzee - a transport engineer and founder of GoMetro, a mapping platform that allows cities to optimise transport investments - don\u2019t see a market for what VW is offering.\n\nMost Kigali residents, he said, use existing, cheaper public transport like motor taxis and buses. Others drive themselves.\n\nAnd while VW faces no direct competition in Kigali, that won\u2019t be the case in many other markets, with Uber and Bolt established in major African cities, a fact that hasn\u2019t yet translated into profits.\n\n\u201cNo ride-sharing service is making money, even with scale. No model creates positive cash return,\u201d Coetzee said.\n\nSo far, the app\u2019s rating on Google\u2019s Play Store - the download platform for Android devices - trails both Uber and Bolt, while the Apple version has been widely panned by iPhone users.\n\nDespite these problems, Deloitte\u2019s Davies thinks VW has leverage that Uber and Bolt lack.\n\nThe promise of assembly plants and factory jobs, he argued, could earn the carmaker tax breaks from governments looking to industrialise along with a voice in policymaking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s VW\u2019s significant competitive advantage here,\u201d he said.", "description": "When Volkswagen's Africa boss Thomas Schaefer set out to conquer the continent, he quickly realised he needed more than a flashy new product.
