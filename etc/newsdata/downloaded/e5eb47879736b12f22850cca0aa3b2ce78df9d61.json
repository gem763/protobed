(Enterprise) and the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) announced today that they are developing a multi-pronged collaboration to create and implement a shared vision for affordable homes that improve residents\u2019 health and well-being.\n\nThe collaboration leverages the experience and vision of Enterprise, the leading market advocate for improving the availability and quality of green, healthy, affordable homes across the country with the deep technical knowledge and market transformation expertise of IWBI, the creators of the premier health and wellness building standard.\n\nWorking with IWBI, Enterprise is creating a best-in-class certification pathway within its Green Communities Criteria, focused on making well-designed homes affordable as well as advancing health outcomes for low- and moderate-income communities. With the integration of key aspects of WELL 2.0 into the criteria, affordable housing developers will have a flexible roadmap for achieving higher levels of health and wellness benefits that are firmly rooted in the latest scientific evidence and design best practices. Beginning next year, affordable housing that certifies to Enterprise\u2019s Green Communities 2020 Criteria will also be certified to WELL.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited about this collaboration with Enterprise,\u201d said IWBI President Rachel Gutter. \u201cNow with the criteria integration complete, the next step is to identify projects we can jointly support and certify to showcase the myriad benefits to residents as well as the short and long-term cost effectiveness of putting people\u2019s health at the center of the decisions for designing, building and operating the places where they live their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur partnership with the WELL team builds on Enterprise\u2019s deep commitment to advancing health outcomes through the design and creation of resilient, green and affordable homes,\u201d said Enterprise President Laurel Blatchford. \u201cBy creating homes and communities with wellness as the foundation, we can lessen health concerns often seen with unstable housing, such as asthma and mental health issues, while decreasing emergency room visits and in-patient hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nThrough the collaboration, Enterprise and IWBI will also advance research and stronger public policy that leads to improved housing options for all.\n\nAbout Enterprise Community Partners\n\nEnterprise is a proven and powerful nonprofit that improves communities and people\u2019s lives by making well-designed homes affordable and connected to opportunity. As a social enterprise, we bring together the nationwide know-how, policy leadership, partners, donors and investors to multiply the impact of local affordable housing development. Over more than 35 years, Enterprise has created 585,000 homes, invested more than $43 billion and touched millions of lives.\n\nEnterprise developed the Green Communities Criteria in 2004, leading the industry in bringing improved health, economic and environmental benefits of sustainable construction practices to low-income families.
