About 851,000 were apprehended and taken into custody by border patrol agents in fiscal year 2019, which ran from Oct. 1, 2018 to Sept. 30, 2019.\n\nFederal data on migrant arrests was shared with The Washington Examiner. The US Customs and Border Protection agency has not released data on how many migrants were able to claim asylum after being taken into custody.\n\nThe number does not include those who approached designated ports of entry along the southern border. As of Aug. 31, not including the September figure (which has not yet been released), 263,000 migrants were denied entry at ports. Neither figure includes arrests or those denied entry at the US-Canada border or along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts.\n\nCentral American asylum seekers wait as U.S. Border Patrol agents take groups of them into custody on June 12, 2018 near McAllen, Texas.

None of the figures provided by CBP reflect the number of migrants who enter the US illegally without detection.\n\nOf the migrants crossing the US-Mexico border in fiscal 2019, at least 250,000 were Guatemalan and another 250,000 were Honduran. Under President Donald Trump's Zero Tolerance policy, more migrant families have been arrested than ever.\n\nRead more: A 3-year-old girl was asked to choose between her mom or dad as a border patrol agent tried to separate the family\n\nMore than 450,000 of the migrants arrested in fiscal 2019 arrived with a family member, compared to fewer than 80,000 of those arrested in 2015. The number of families arrested has only increased since the Border Patrol agency was created in 1924, with a sharp uptick under the Trump administration, in comparison to the total number of arrests, which has fluctuated.\n\nPast data from US Border Patrol on the total number of apprehensions along the southern border shows that, starting in 2008 \u2014 the first year of President Barack Obama's term, the number of total arrests began to decline sharply. During President George W. Bush's administration, the number frequently rose above 1 million.\n\nUnder Obama, arrests typically hovered under 500,000. Under the first two years of Trump's administration, before the Zero Tolerance policy was instituted in 2018, the numbers remained at about the level under Obama's administration. The most recent data indicates a sharp rise after Trump's 2018 policy \u2014 more than doubling the fiscal 2018 number \u2014 but there are still not as many arrests as there were under the Bush administration.", "description": "New federal data shows about 851,000 migrants were arrested by border patrol along the US-Mexico border in fiscal 2019, the highest number since 2007.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9896c2d831b21f7530e086?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
