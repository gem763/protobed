Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOne of the much-anticipated features of this week\u2019s Democratic presidential-candidate debate in Houston is the first direct encounter between two of the field\u2019s Big Three: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. And via CNN, Team Biden is letting it be known that its champion is going to go after the fiery yet wonky Massachusetts progressive on one of her favorite talking points:\n\nJoe Biden is expected to use this week\u2019s debate to argue Democrats should select a nominee who is able to offer \u201cmore than plans,\u201d an adviser to the former vice-president says, previewing a potential line of attack against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose campaign mantra is \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for that \u2026\u201d\n\nThe Biden adviser said the campaign refuses to \u201caccept that the bold, far-reaching change\u201d proposed by Biden is \u201canything but progressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more expensive a plan is doesn\u2019t make it more progressive. Running for president is about making people\u2019s lives better, and that only happens if the change proposed becomes reality,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nYou know, I\u2019m not sure Biden ought to go there. For all the scope and ambition associated with her \u201cplans,\u201d Warren has spent a good deal of time thinking about how to make those plans \u201creality.\u201d In a long interview with Ezra Klein earlier this year, she talked extensively about how to use filibuster reform, an anti-corruption bill, a wealth tax, and executive actions to set the table for her broader legislative agenda with this insight being central:\n\nI think this is one of the reasons to run on plans, because if I get elected on those plans, it gives me the capacity to turn around and say to my colleagues, \u201cHey, that\u2019s what I ran on, that\u2019s what the majority of the American people voted for, that\u2019s what they got out and fought for. So as the Democratic Party, that\u2019s what we got to do.\u201d\n\nTeam Biden seems to equate \u201crealism\u201d with policy moderation. But unfortunately, his refusal (so far) to come to grips with the institutional constraints of the Senate, which he loves so much, given the obstructionist power of Mitch McConnell\u2019s Republicans, whom he na\u00efvely believes he can win over, makes him an exceptionally unrealistic candidate. As my colleague Jonathan Chait observed earlier this year when Biden defended the filibuster (after often speaking fondly of its most adept manipulators prior to McConnell, the southern segregationists), the former veep suffers from a debilitating disease he calls \u201cSenatitis\u201d:\n\nSenatitis is an irrational reverence for the folkways and culture of the upper legislative chamber. Those afflicted believe that the Senate gathers together 100 of the finest statesmen in American life, or at least transforms ordinary politicians into such giants through its mystical traditions. To the extent they see any problems with the operations of their beloved chamber, it can only be ascribed to the corrupting effects of non-senatorial politics, and the solution is always to make American politics more senatorial. If you hear somebody unironically use the phrase \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body,\u201d you have located an acute sufferer \u2026\n\n[N]one of the Democratic senators running for president can match Biden\u2019s adoration. The Senate\u2019s traditions form his model for how politics ought to be conducted. \u201cThe system\u2019s worked pretty damn well,\u201d Biden recently told a reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Constitution. It says you have to get a consensus to get anything done.\u201d In his presidential announcement speech, Biden frontally challenged the notion that the system had changed and made large-scale bipartisanship obsolete. \u201cSome of these people are saying, \u2018Biden just doesn\u2019t get it. You can\u2019t work with Republicans anymore. That\u2019s not the way it works anymore.\u2019 Well, folks, I\u2019m going to say something outrageous. I know how to make government work \u2014 not because I\u2019ve talked or tweeted about it, but because I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve worked across the aisle to reach consensus.\u201d\n\nMaybe the Senate will work as in days of yore in another 50 years or so, if and when climate change has reduced the country\u2019s policy options to moderate versus radical Chicken Little\u2013ism. But for now, Senatitis plays directly into the hands of the reactionaries who are using every anti-democratic lever our system has created to thwart the popular will and stop anything threatening to those enjoying or pursuing privilege. This makes the oh-so-reasonable Biden a candidate full of wild fancy and pixie dust, a unicorn-seeker just like his fellow late-septuagenarian Bernie Sanders, who has also been lukewarm at best about filibuster reform and thinks he can conjure up a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d to magically enact his agenda.\n\nYou have to figure that, if elected, either of these men (and other candidates who don\u2019t have plans to enact their plans) would sober up and begin to confront the actual challenge a Democratic president will face. Until then, though, Joe Biden doesn\u2019t need to be sniping at Elizabeth Warren for a lack of \u201crealism.\u201d", "description": "Joe Biden will reportedly challenge Elizabeth Warren in this week\u2019s debate to be \u201crealistic\u201d instead of embracing her many plans. But Biden\u2019s failure to develop a plan to enact his own agenda, and instead rely on bipartisanship, is very unrealistic.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/08/22/22-joe-biden-and-elizabeth-warren.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
