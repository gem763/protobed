Perhaps it\u2019s an unexpected revelation about a loved one, or a troubling news report. For me, it was this 32-word Daily Mail headline about Sarah Palin attending a Kid Rock concert, her impending divorce, and a cryptic meme.\n\nSome of it I understood. I knew that on Monday, the Anchorage Daily News had reported that Todd Palin \u2014 husband of former Alaska governor, vice-presidential candidate, and aspiring Skinny Tea influencer Sarah Palin \u2014 had filed for divorce from his wife of 31 years. The reason, according to court documents, was an \u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife.\u201d\n\nThe rest, however, bewildered me. A Kid Rock concert? A cryptic meme?\n\nIt was a lot to digest. Maybe visualizing it would help me understand.\n\nFirst, what I knew: Sarah Palin rocked out at a Kid Rock concert in Wisconsin just one week before her husband Todd filed for divorce.\n\nOkay. Those two events don\u2019t seem connected, but the timeline makes sense.\n\nNext: Bristol Palin\u2019s ex-husband posted a cryptic meme. But when? Everything in the headline is written in the present tense, as if all three of these seemingly wildly disparate events are taking place at the same time, even though we know at least two of them happened \u201cjust one week\u201d apart.\n\nAt first, I read it like this:\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, however, Bristol Palin\u2019s ex-husband, Dakota Meyer, posted the meme in question on Monday, a few hours after the report that Todd Palin had filed for divorce. So actually the timeline looks like this:\n\nWere any of these events really connected though? Here\u2019s a video Palin posted from the concert in question which, while whimsically edited, doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with her divorce.\n\nAs for the meme, it\u2019s a picture of a ripped, tattooed dude in a half-up ponytail holding a bow and arrow, and the words: \u201cA man should understand he doesn\u2019t protect his woman because she is weak. He protects her because she is IMPORTANT.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly. We need more of this,\u201d Meyer captioned the picture. It doesn\u2019t really seem to have anything to do with the Kid Rock concert or his former in-laws\u2019 divorce.\n\nHours later, my day fully derailed, my brain fully melted, I could finally conclude the following: Bristol Palin\u2019s ex-husband posted a random meme a couple of hours after Todd Palin filed for divorce from Sarah Palin, who had, a week earlier, attended a Kid Rock concert, and none of these three events were related.\n\nDoes that clear things up?\n\nStay in touch.
