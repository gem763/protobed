The longtime Overstock board member said that neither the company nor any past or present executive has received a \u201cWells notice\u201d from the SEC enforcement staff. A Wells notice is a document the SEC sends to people or firms when it is planning probable legal action for violating federal security laws.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had requests for information for almost a year,\u201d Johnson told Fox Business. \u201cWe have spent a king\u2019s ransom to process their requests for information to put this to bed.\u201d Johnson believe that based on conversations he recently had with the commission the state of the investigation is \u201calmost dormant.\u201d\n\nAn SEC spokesman declined comment.\n\nJohnson spoke to Fox Business as speculation continues to swirl around Byrne\u2019s surprise August 22 exit from the company he founded, ending one of the most flamboyant CEO tenures in corporate America.\n\nByrne started Overstock 1999 as an online retailer specializing in selling furniture and soon branched out to selling other products including jewelry, apparel, pet supplies, and electronics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince going public in 2002, the company has often been the target of short-sellers who bet the company\u2019s shares would decline based on what they said was Overstock\u2019s shaky finances. Byrne mounted an aggressive campaign against the \u201cshorts\u201d--who he said were distorting Overstock\u2019s financial issues.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Byrne led a crusade of sorts to seek regulatory and legislative remedies to curtail short seller abuses, often appearing on business news shows and even meeting with sympathetic congressional leaders to complain about the practice.\n\nWhile he had little to show for his efforts (the SEC continues to view short selling as a necessary tool to curtail hyping of stocks), Byrne created an outsized public persona.\n\nThat persona seemed to reach new heights last month when he said he was resigning from Overstock because of his romantic involvement with a Russian agent who is now serving jail time as part of the FBI probe into foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMany investors were skeptical of Byrne\u2019s reasoning and immediately pointed to public disclosures made by Overstock about what appeared to be a widening investigation by the SEC\u2019s enforcement staff into Overstock\u2019s new blockchain business, started by Byrne in 2018, to create a crypto stock market.\n\nThat company, known as tZERO, became the focus of an SEC probe in February 2018, according to public filings. The company has made periodic disclosures about the investigation, including one in December 2018 that suggested the SEC\u2019s probe has expanded. While former CEO Byrne hailed tZERO as a way to revolutionize the business, the blockchain arm of the business, Medici Ventures, is hemmoraghing money -- $61 million last year. Johnson has been the president of Medici Ventures.\n\nMeanwhile, Overstock's revenue continued to shrink in the competitive e-retailing space and the company reported a loss of $0.69 per share last quarter. Shares of the e-commerce company have declined more than 22 percent since Byrne\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut Johnson tells Fox Business while the investigation has been a distraction--he says it has impeded plans to sell Overstock\u2019s retail business with one buyer--significant enforcement action is not expected.\n\nJohnson says the last time the SEC\u2019s enforcement staff asked for information was in December 2018. The investigation appears to be focusing on public comments Overstock officials made that may have hyped investors' interest in putting money into tZERO. Johnson said two investors had either reduced their planned stake or declined to put money into the project after initially signaling greater interest.\n\n\u201cWe disclosed what they initially said,\u201d Johnson said of the investors\u2019 interest adding that the company didn\u2019t intentionally mislead anyone.\n\nOne problem the company faces in describing its dealings with regulators is that the investigation is occurring while Overstock is dealing with SEC compliance staff over the creation of tZERO. The crypto currency is not under investigation but undergoing a routine review of its plans for a crypto stock market. \u201cThe two sets of dialogue got conflated into one,\u201d said Johnson. Johnson added that the various company statements about its involvement with the agency created a misimpression that the enforcement staff was routinely badgering the company for documents when it was mainly the compliance staffs doing so in its review.\n\nOne problem the company faces in describing its dealings with regulators is that the investigation is occurring while Overstock is dealing with SEC compliance staff over the creation of tZERO, which is not an investigation but rather a routine review of its plans for a crypto stock market. \u201cThe two sets of dialogue got conflated into one,\u201d he said, leading to the misimpression that the enforcement staff was routinely badgering the company for documents when it was the compliance staffs doing so in its review.\n\nJohnson said he met with SEC officials in late June in an effort to end the investigation or at least get an understanding of its scope. He is awaiting to hear back from the federal agency.\n\n\u201cWe have been dealing with the SEC for 17 years and the enforcement staff has zero incentive to close a case unless you cooperate and push and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d Johnson said.", "description": "Overstock interim CEO tells Fox Business SEC has not asked the company for information since December 2018.", "authors": ["Charles Gasparino", "Lydia Moynihan"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Patrick-Byrne-Overstock-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
