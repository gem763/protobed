I am prepared to accept whatever sentence you deem fit.\u201d\n\nAs part of her sentence, Huffman will also have to pay a $30,000 fine, have supervised release for one year and do 250 hours of community service.\n\nHuffman was the first parent to be sentenced in the college admissions scam, and had husband and actor William H. Macy with her in court.\n\nProsecutors had previously recommended a one-month jail sentence for Huffman, plus a $20,000 fine and one year\u2019s probation.\n\nIn May, the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d actor pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, after being accused of paying $15,000 to cheat on her daughter\u2019s SAT exam.\n\nHuffman was one of dozens of wealthy parents who were charged earlier this year in a nationwide college admissions scam, for allegedly paying bribes to get their kids into elite universities, including Yale; Stanford; the University of California, Los Angeles and more.\n\n\u201cThe outrage in this case is a system that is already so distorted by money and privilege in the first place,\u201d the judge said in handing down Huffman\u2019s sentence in court Friday. \u201cIn a system in that context, that you took the step of having one more advantage to put your child ahead.\u201d\n\nAs part of the bribery scheme, known as Operation Varsity Blues, wealthy parents allegedly paid to falsely boost their children\u2019s exam scores or to have their children apply as student-athletes even if they had no skills in the relevant sport. \u201cFull House\u201d actor Lori Loughlin and her designer husband Mossimo Giannulli were also charged in the scam and both pleaded not guilty.\n\nHuffman recently wrote in a letter to the judge that she was just trying to give her kid a \u201cfair shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother, I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair.\u201d\n\nIn a memo filed last week, prosecutors wrote: \u201cAll parents want to help their kids get ahead, yet most manage to steer clear of conspiracy, bribery and fraud.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the judge said: \u201cTrying to be a good mother doesn\u2019t excuse this.\u201d\n\nFelicity Huffman departs federal court in Boston, where she pleaded guilty to charges in a nationwide college admissions bribery scandal. (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS) More\n\nAfter news of the college admissions scandal broke, many pointed out that higher education admissions are already rigged to favor wealthy and white students \u2015 even before reaching the point of criminality \u2015 whether in the form of donations to schools or extra tutors, essay coaches and interview prep professionals who help the elite get their kids into Ivy League schools. Legacy status, in particular, tips the scales heavily in an applicant\u2019s favor \u2015 and disproportionately benefits white students.\n\nEarlier this year, California lawmakers proposed a series of bills that aimed to reform college admissions in the state. The first of the bills to reach the governor\u2019s desk would require colleges to disclose whether they give preferential treatment to applicants related to donors or alumni (the bill is still awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s (D) possible signature before it would become law).", "description": "The actor had pleaded guilty after being accused of paying $15,000 to cheat on her daughter\u2019s SAT test.", "authors": ["Sarah Ruiz-Grossman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N.XVJH9HEtYDmcaeZ6gaog--~B/aD0zMDAzO3c9NDM3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76bf4d2300009f0351297f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
