It fell to $1.0964 per euro, though both moves were less than a tenth of a percentage point.\n\nIt held close to a one-week low against the New Zealand dollar at $0.6265 per kiwi and weakened a little against the beaten-up Australian dollar to $0.6715.\n\nAdding to concerns, the United States won approval on Wednesday to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods over illegal subsidies handed to Airbus, threatening to trigger a transatlantic trade war.\n\nFutures pricing indicated a 73% chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce benchmark interest rates to support the economy at its next meeting later this month.\n\nThat is up from about 60% a day earlier, but was not enough to drive a spirited flight from the dollar, which is also widely seen as a safety bet at times of economic or political uncertainty. The greenback held steady against a basket of currencies, just above 99 and not miles below the two year high 99.667 it hit on Tuesday.\n\n\"It seems like there's been a bit of a seachange in market sentiment,\" said Nick Twidale co-founder of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge, though adding that the U.S. still looked in better shape the Europe.\n\n\"I think overall (the dollar) will remain grinding higher while there's still a disparity between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe next readings on global economic health will be European August retail sales and a German service sector survey due on Thursday, and September's U.S. non-manufacturing ISM survey due at 1400 GMT.\n\nThe pound was steady at $1.2304 after fluctuating in a tight range as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson proposed an all-island regulatory zone in Ireland in his final pitch for a Brexit deal before the end of the month.\n\nSterling's outlook, however, remained uncertain after a cool response to the proposal from Brussels, leaving a no-deal exit from the European Union on Oct. 31 a real possibility.\n\nIn offshore trade, the Chinese yuan ticked up slightly to 7.1368 per dollar, with trade subdued as Chinese markets are closed until Monday for public holidays.", "description": "The dollar eased on Thursday, sliding to fresh one-week lows against the euro and yen as investor anxiety deepened over fresh signs of slowing U.S. economic growth and a broadening of global trade frictions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102217775-142548570.jpg?v=1570063763"}
