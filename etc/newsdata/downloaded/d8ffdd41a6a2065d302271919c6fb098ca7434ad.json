This Wizarding World that the filmmakers created, and as seen on the big screen, possesses a charm that is delightfully unique to the franchise.\n\nWhile the first \"Harry Potter\" movies are stylistically steeped in school days, the \"Fantastic Beasts\" films are far more sophisticated in spirit. This brand new Fantastic Beasts collection by Pottery Barn Teen pays homage to the \"Harry Potter\" prequels in subtle and stunning ways.\n\nThe Fantastic Beasts line is inspired, as was the movie, by art nouveau, art deco, and 1920s New York City. Think Erte, the Chrysler Building, and glamorous flappers mixed in with a healthy dose of a wizardly aesthetic. There are snake mirrors, phoenix lamps, magic wand pillows, Elder Wand bedding, velvet robes, and cozy throws \u2014 all embodying old-school glamour.\n\nI, for one, love a whimsical touch when it comes to home decor and have set my sights on ordering the Wizarding World Nagini Mirror and the Magical Spells Table Lamp. And I'm far from my teen years, proving that Pottery Barn's younger offerings aren't only for those under the age of 18. If you'd like to shop a more adult line, they've also released a new Harry Potter collection for entertaining over at Pottery Barn that includes pillows, Hogwarts napkins, and a very cool floating candle.\n\nIn the meantime, take a peek at 10 of our favorite pieces from Pottery Barn Teen's new Fantastic Beasts collection:", "description": "Harry Potter fans should check out the Fantastic Beasts line at Pottery Barn Teen.
