It\u2019s part of a plan that the state rejected in January, calling it too costly. The utility on Monday came back with a more modest proposal and a smaller price tag of $594 million, down from more than $1 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest twist in the saga over Dominion\u2019s massive overcharges in 2017 and 2018, which were flagged in a Virginia state report in August. Infuriated consumer advocates have called on the company to return the money to no avail, and one ratepayer group staged a \u201cRally for Our Refunds\u201d in Richmond three weeks ago.\n\nLike most power companies, Dominion is only allowed to earn a certain amount. Some utilities have returned extra cash to customers in the past if earnings exceed the threshold. The latest fight in Virginia is centered on a state law passed last year that allows electricity providers to keep some excess profits so long as they re-invest the money in renewable projects or grid upgrades.\n\nDominion has already said it plans to spend some of the funds on an offshore wind demonstration project, which broke ground this summer. \u201cWhat a great way to fund the first utility offshore wind project -- to be able to do it without having a rate increase,\u201d Thomas Wohlfarth, Dominion\u2019s senior vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a phone interview.\n\nUsing the company\u2019s over-earnings to pay for such projects will limit rate hikes and cut down on financing costs, saving money for customers in the long run, he said.\n\nThere is a hitch: Under the new law, Virginia\u2019s first review of utilities\u2019 excess earnings will cover a four-year period. So if Dominion doesn\u2019t earn as much in the next two years as it did in the last two, there\u2019s a chance the extra cash it has overcollected shrinks or disappears altogether, wiping out the money it\u2019s proposing to set aside for grid improvements and renewable power.\n\n\u201cThe two-year look is not the final story,\u201d Wohlfarth said. \u201cWe have to see what happens in the next two years.\u201d\n\nAnalysts attributed much of Dominion\u2019s excess income to warmer-than-normal weather in Virginia last year, which led to stronger electricity sales. The state report showed that the money came from Dominion\u2019s power-generation business, rather than its distribution system.\n\n\u201cIf the weather is warmer than normal and you sell more electricity than normal, you\u2019re going to overearn,\u201d said Charles Fishman, a utilities analyst at Morningstar Inc.\n\nShares of the company climbed 0.2% to close at $81.22. They have risen about 14% in 2019.\n\nDominion\u2019s $594 million grid plan will need approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The company is proposing to cover about half of the cost with some of the extra cash and recover the rest through customer rates. The program would help deploy the customer platform and smart meters through 2021.\n\n(Adds utility executive quote and funding details starting in the fifth paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: David R.
