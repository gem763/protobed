You could get shocked. You could get killed.\"\n\n'Not a lot of common sense'\n\nAnnual homecoming parties in Kingston are a regular problem, but Keech said this has never been an issue before.\n\nHe said they do education programs for small children, but never would have thought they had to make this case to grown-ups.\n\n\"You're talking about young adults here and I am quite surprised people would do that,\" he said.\n\n\"There is not a lot of common sense here and it could quite easily kill you.\"\n\nDon\u2019t turn a party into peril!
