( VFC ) \u2014 which owns brands including Timberland, Vans and The North Face \u2014 said it will stop using leather from the South American country until it has \"the confidence and assurance that the materials used in our products do not contribute to environmental harm in the country,\" according to a statement.\n\nDemand for beef and leather has caused huge swathes of land in the rainforest to be cleared for cattle ranches, potentially a major factor behind the fires.\n\nVF Corp. is a major player in apparel and footwear, also owning brands such as Eastpak and JanSport. VF's activewear and outdoor brands helped the firm generate $13.8 billion in earnings for 2019, it reported in July.\n\nIts move suggests the international outcry over the fires , and the response from populist Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, is spilling into the business world.\n\nThe Amazon, which spans eight countries and covers 40% of South America, is often referred to as \"the planet's lungs\" because estimates show that nearly 20% of oxygen produced by the Earth's land comes from rainforest. The Amazon also puts an enormous amount of water into the atmosphere and works to regulate global temperatures.\n\nBut Bolsonaro has sparred with global powers over the blazes, which number over 80,000 this year \u2014 in particular during a prickly G7 meeting in France this week.\n\nThe President's special communications office told CNN on Tuesday morning that Brazil would turn down the $20 million aid offer that was pledged for the Amazon at the G7 summit in France the day before.\n\nThe President has since softened his stance on the financial aid, suggesting he would consider the G7's aid if French President Emmanuel Macron apologized for accusing Bolsonaro of \"lying\" to him about climate commitments during trade negotiations.\n\nThe nation has also since accepted $12 million in aid from the UK government, which is a member of the G7.\n\nBolsonaro has repeatedly insisted the Amazon should be opened to development and has defunded the agencies responsible for cracking down on illegal activity, but he rejected accusations that he was partly responsible for the fires.", "description": "A major US shoemaker will stop buying Brazilian leather while fires are ravaging the Amazon rainforest.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190828102605-brazil-fire-super-tease.jpg"}
