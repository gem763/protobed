The bulk of the athletes - 327 of them - came from what are known as the Power Five conferences - the Pac-12, SEC, ACC, Big 12 and Big Ten - that have the largest TV football and basketball contracts and operate the largest sports departments.\n\nThe money schools bring in off football and basketball helps fund pretty much every other sport, but many of those programs struggle to stay afloat nonetheless. Between 1991 and 2012, for instance, the number of men\u2019s gymnastics teams shrunk from 36 to 16. Men\u2019s wrestling teams decreased from 110 to 77.\n\nWell aware of how closely its success is tied to the NCAA, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is strengthening its relationship with college sports and has been pushing for reforms that will make it simpler for athletes to pursue Olympic track without jeopardizing their college eligibility. Financial pressures because of the NCAA\u2019s strict rules about sponsorships have long been a concern. The USOPC formed a college advisory council in 2017 that consists of executives at Duke, Alabama, Stanford, Texas and the Big 12, among others.\n\nWithin the Olympic world, track and field is faring better than most sports. According to NCAA statistics, there were 286 men\u2019s and 338 women\u2019s track teams in Division I as of 2018, which marks a slight increase over the past decade - not surprising considering one of the foundations of Title IX is to offer the same number of opportunities for women to play college sports as for men.\n\nOf course, this is something of a mixed blessing for those who bleed red, white and blue.\n\nIn Rio, all but four of America\u2019s 129 track and field athletes were groomed in the NCAA. But those same schools are helping produce champions for other countries, as well.\n\nFor instance, five of the 42 Jamaicans who competed at the NCAA championships in June will be in Doha this week. In another twist, Jamaica\u2019s top hurdler, 2015 world champion Danielle Williams, is a volunteer assistant coach at Clemson, meaning she\u2019s able to train there.\n\nGermany, Canada, Nigeria and Grenada are among the countries that have athletes who will complete a \u201cdouble\u201d of sorts this year by competing in both NCAA and world championships.\n\nAnderson Peters holds Grenada\u2019s national record in the javelin throw and is also the NCAA champion out of Mississippi State.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s done a lot for me,\u201d Peters said of the leap of faith he took when he enrolled in American college. \u201cThe facility is for sure 100% better than the facilities I had at home. The coaching staff, the treatment that I\u2019ve been getting on my body has been pretty good. It really helps.\u201d\n\nMax Siegel, the CEO of USA Track and Field, said his federation and others work hard to improve the quality of the sport in all countries, not just the United States.\n\n\u201cWe all benefit by collaborating,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cWe take pride in that.\u201d\n\nNo single entity represents that spirit better than the quintessentially American institution of college sports.\n\nOf the 31 U.S. sports teams at the Summer Games in Rio, all but 11 had rosters with at least half its athletes\u2019 roots in a college program.\n\nNone of those sports depends more on the colleges than track, which essentially uses the schools not only as a training ground, but as a scouting system to determine where athletes stand - both competitively and within their financial support system - when they get out.\n\nThe U.S. team compiled a record 30 medals at the 2017 world championships and could be looking at a similar haul both this year and at next year\u2019s Olympics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to thank the American high school system and the American college system for giving us a great jump-start,\u201d said USA Track and Field\u2019s chief of sport, Duffy Mahoney. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that we embarked on that kind of operational philosophy umpteen years ago and we\u2019re getting better at it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nobody would think of asking Jamaicans, Kenyans or other winners to play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" if they capture a gold medal at world championships next week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eddie Pells", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/worlds_true_to_your_school_98031_c0-200-3390-2176_s1770x1032.jpg?40ac39f02cc296cc43420f56ce0d89f5485f3a14", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
