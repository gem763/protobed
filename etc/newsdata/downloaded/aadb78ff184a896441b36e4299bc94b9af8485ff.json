Asking Mueller to reflect on the president\u2019s state of mind was like expecting Siri to offer up her thoughts on Hegel.\n\nSo now Democrats are left with the same question that\u2019s increasingly divided the party in recent weeks \u2014 and is almost certain to spill out into the party\u2019s nomination contest, too.\n\nShould they impeach Donald Trump?\n\nLeaving political calculation aside for the moment, the answer depends, I suppose, on what you think impeachment is really for.\n\nIf you\u2019ve grown up in America and you\u2019re under, say, 30, you may not realize that impeachment wasn\u2019t always bandied about as a remedy for bad presidents. Until Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency collapsed in 1974 (he really was caught saying some pretty shocking things on tape), the idea of impeachment was mostly considered a historical oddity, like dueling with pistols, or mock turtlenecks.\n\nBut then came Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and something called the Starr report, and like so much else in our politics, the extreme became the perfectly plausible. That\u2019s especially true now, given what we know about the ugly circumstances of Trump\u2019s election and his bullying of prosecutors and witnesses.\n\nNot since Clinton\u2019s nadir has the possibility of impeachment taken on so much weight or relevance. Not since Nixon has any president watched members of his inner circle strike deals and go to jail as prosecutors circle the White House.\n\nEver since the Mueller report was submitted to the Justice Department (and then blatantly mischaracterized by the attorney general) in April, Mueller has overtly hinted that Congress should at least take up the question of impeachment.\n\nMueller takes the position that, since a sitting president can\u2019t be indicted, it\u2019s not up to investigators to reach any conclusion about presidential crimes; the Constitution gives that power expressly to the House.\n\nAs of this week, more than 90 Democrats in Congress have said they support impeaching Trump. Jerry Nadler, the New York congressman who chairs the Judiciary Committee, pointed this week to \u201cvery substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which, as you probably know, happens to be the constitutional standard for removing a commander in chief.\n\nAll of which makes for a halfway compelling case, if you look at impeachment chiefly as a legal proceeding. This seems to be Mueller\u2019s point, and Nadler\u2019s too \u2014 that the purpose of impeachment is to provide a special court system for law-breaking presidents who are otherwise shielded from prosecution.\n\nBut impeachment isn\u2019t just a trial mechanism. If it were, the Framers probably wouldn\u2019t have left us with vague language about \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which could cover anything from murder to shoplifting. They might have left the trial business to a panel of actual judges, rather than handing the whole thing over to Congress, which was bound to be saddled with political biases and arcane rivalries.\n\nNo, impeachment isn\u2019t just a legal remedy. Nor is it a way for opposition parties to negate the results of an election, no matter how clouded by allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nIt\u2019s a political tool. It\u2019s designed specifically to carry out the public will.\n\nImpeachment is there not principally to give the government a way to level charges, but to give the electorate a way to change its mind. It\u2019s there so that if a duly elected president acts in a way that thoroughly appalls the voters and squanders their confidence in the integrity of the office, we don\u2019t have to wait for the next election to send that president home.", "description": "Impeachment isn\u2019t just a legal remedy.
