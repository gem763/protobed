Here\u2019s why: Because nobody wants to be put through the same ringer that Trump\u2019s being put through. Right?\n\nEither that, or it\u2019s because those who fail to \u201ccall it out\u201d are benefiting from the secretiveness.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d Trump said, Bloomberg reported. \u201cThese people are sick. They\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nBreitbart reported he went on to say, \u201c[N]obody\u2019s called it out like I do, I don\u2019t understand. people are afraid to call it out, they are afraid to say the press is crooked, we have a crooked press, we have a dishonest media.\u201d\n\nIndeed.\n\nTrump, like him or hate him, agree with him or disagree with him, but the fact is that when it comes to disrupting political norms, he\u2019s king.\n\nTrump\u2019s opened eyes onto a corrupt U.S. intel machine. Trump\u2019s shed light on a deep-seated political structure that\u2019s joined together elitists from both parties at the expense of the people they\u2019re supposed to represent. And he\u2019s flashed sunshine onto an entitlement-minded world stage where players who\u2019ve not been used to accountability \u2014 and say, paying their fair U.N. and NATO shares \u2014 are now being held to account and told, hey, pay your fair shares.\n\nHe\u2019s actually shown America who America\u2019s common enemy is, and it\u2019s not so much the guy wearing the \u201cD\u201d button versus the gal donning the \u201cR\u201d hat as it is the movers and shakers who seek to influence on a worldwide scale \u2014 who seek to turn sovereign nations into melting pots of borderless parcels of land.\n\nAmerica\u2019s biggest enemies are the globalists.\n\nSome are socialists. Some are progressives. Some are Democrats \u2014 indeed, some are Republicans.\n\nBut their common denominator is they all believe the government knows best, and the bigger the government, the better it is for all concerned. They see the United Nations as an actual solution to the world\u2019s wars; they consider the central banks and concepts like currency manipulation as crucial to keeping economies steady; they regard the free market with suspicious eyes; they advance ideas like Global First, America Second in U.S. public schools, and try hard to teach the next generations of the world to think outside the sovereign box.\n\nTrump, in all his Make America Great Again, America First glories, is an offense to them.\n\nAn offense \u2014 and threat. A threat to power and pocketbooks, both.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at war,\u201d he said, in this New York City meeting.\n\nYes. We are. And the enemy is both foreign and domestic. The anti-American enemy of globalism isn\u2019t just at America\u2019s gate. It\u2019s inside. For one sign of proof, just look at all the vitriol surrounding this White House.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
