We're calling for an election so we won't be delivering the Budget on November 6.\"\n\nA source confirmed the Budget would be cancelled even if - as expected - Labour defeat Boris Johnson's bid for an election on Monday.\n\nIt means key sectors like social care are still hanging in the balance while the Tory leader agitates for a general election.\n\nAnd there is still no clarity over whether the cruel benefit freeze, which has gone on for four years, will come to an end in April.\n\nEarlier this week, Boris Johnson's spokesman said the budget date had been decided on the assumption that Britain was leaving the European Union with a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nBut on Thursday the Prime Minister was forced to concede that he would not meet his \"do or die\" deadline to leave the EU next week.\n\nMr Javid has previously said his budget plan would include higher public spending and a review of Britain's budget rules.", "description": "A Treasury source said: \"We're calling for an election so we won't be delivering the Budget on November 6\"", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Peter Summers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652434.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Parliament-Sits-On-A-Saturday-To-Vote-On-Boris-Johnsons-Brexit-Deal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
