The Rockets are now stuck with an over-the-hill center they can\u2019t trade for value and can\u2019t play much without triggering bonuses that\u2019ll make him way overpaid.\n\nIf they had known how this would turn out, they would\u2019ve signed Nene to a one-year minimum contract at most. At least that\u2019d be partially subsidized by the league. Because this is is a two-year deal, Houston is on the hook for the full base salary.\n\nThe Rockets got a valuable trade chip with Nene\u2019s contract.\n\nAt least if the deal goes through.\n\nBobby Marks of ESPN:\n\nAlthough Nene signed with the Houston Rockets on Sept. 6, the NBA has yet to officially approve the deal. The 10-day delay is a result of the NBA discussing internally whether it should disapprove details in the contract, according to multiple sources.\n\nNene\u2019s contract includes a low base salary with a massive amount of likely incentives. Houston could count Nene\u2019s full $10 million salary (base plus likely incentives) in a trade. The acquiring team would then owe Nene his base salary plus only the bonuses he actually triggers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s a workaround to the typical salary-matching rules.\n\nThe bonuses are tied to individual games played and team games won. Because Nene played 42 games for the 53-win Rockets last season, the bonuses are qualified as likely. Last year\u2019s performance is the default way to determine whether incentives are likely or unlikely.\n\nYou can read more about the contract\u2019s structure here.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s apprehension is interesting. The Collective Bargaining Agreement specifies a procedure for challenging incentive classification when the league or union believes the prior season is not a fair predictor. Essentially, that side makes a case to an arbiter that the default assumption is \u201cvery likely\u201d to be wrong.\n\nHowever, in a funny quirk here, that challenge system lays out only how the NBA can challenge to turn unlikely incentives into likely incentives and how the union can challenge to turn likely incentives into unlikely incentives. There\u2019s nothing about the NBA turning likely incentives into unlikely incentives, which the league is apparently considering here (and would make Nene\u2019s contract invalid, as there\u2019s a limit on unlikely incentives).\n\nThe CBA also prohibits circumventing the spirit of the rules. The league could rule Houston did that here. However, that\u2019s a tough case considering not only does Nene\u2019s contract meet all stated technicalities, there\u2019s a section specifically on challenging these types of details. It just doesn\u2019t apply.\n\nThe Heat opened the door for likely/unlikely-incentive shenanigans a couple years ago. We didn\u2019t hear then about the NBA challenging those contracts, and that\u2019s where the official challenge system would\u2019ve applied.\n\nIt seems unfair to punish the Rockets\u2019 creativity now.", "description": "The Rockets got a valuable trade chip with Nene's contract.
