It\u2019s me, 2019 calling, with some timely tuneup tips\u2014like starting the new year with a thorough assessment of your health. We have tests that can \u201czoom in\u201d on typical trouble spots, better than ever. So we can get a jump on fixing them, or better yet, pronouncing them untroubling\u2014with greater confidence than ever.\n\nMessage #1:Testing, testing, testing\n\nEvery new year brings us new diagnostic tools and improved early detection tests. Nothing could be more important. Many common, dangerous diseases have a wicked habit of showing no symptoms for years. Cancer, for example, can lie dormant for up to 10 years before it ambushes you with a red-flag lump or bump.\n\nSo, when you make an appointment with your doctor for an annual physical, make sure this list of recommended screenings is part of your examination. If you had any of these tests in 2018, move on to the next one after checking with your doctor(s).\n\nImportant note: before your doctor orders any of these tests, be sure to tell her or him about any unusual new symptoms, sensitivities, or \u201cnot-quite right\u201d feelings you might have. The best medical outcomes happen when you and your doctor can work together as a team. So, any new information you can offer is vitally important to guiding your test regimen\u2014keeping you steps ahead of any game a disease might be playing.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the standard tests, then move on to additional tests your results might say you need. We\u2019ll finish with tests that are highly recommended\u2014for vision, hearing, and oral health\u2014but that aren\u2019t usually part of a routine physical.\n\nTests for blood sugar\n\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood sugar (or glucose)\u2014your body\u2019s main source of energy\u2014is chronically too high.\n\nInsulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, escorts glucose into your cells so that it can be used for energy. But when you have type 2 diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t make enough insulin or it doesn\u2019t use insulin properly\u2014a condition called insulin resistance. Over time, glucose remains in your blood instead of entering your cells, which leads to consistently high blood sugar\u2014and eventually, diabetes.\n\nOver the long term, serious issues can develop as a result of chronically high blood sugar, including eye, kidney, nerve, and heart problems.\n\nHemoglobin A1C\n\nThe A1C (also called the hbA1c) test is the most accurate and trusted test for diabetes. It requires a small blood sample, which provides an average of your blood sugar levels over a 3-month span.\n\nHemoglobin is a protein found in our red blood cells. When glucose enters these cells, it attaches to molecules of hemoglobin. The more glucose found in your blood, the more hemoglobin molecules have been attached.\n\nBecause red blood cells have a lifespan of about 3 months, the A1C test measures how much glucose has attached itself to the hemoglobin in your red blood cells over that period of time.\n\nThe hemoglobin level is expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per 100 milliliters of blood.\n\nResults less than 5 percent are considered normal.\n\nResults between 5.7-6.4 percent are associated with prediabetes, meaning your blood sugar levels are elevated, but not high enough to get a full diagnosis of diabetes.\n\nIf prediabetes is your result, now is the time to change your lifestyle and diet to bring your glucose down to normal range! You can do it naturally and without drugs, but you must get started immediately.\n\nResults equal to or greater than 6.5 percent indicate diabetes.\n\nIf people get inconclusive A1C results or have a type of hemoglobin that makes the A1C test inaccurate, additional tests are in order. Many physicians perform one or more of the following tests even for people showing normal A1C results. A second set of eyes in the lab is never a bad idea.\n\nFasting Plasma Glucose (or Blood Sugar) Test\n\nThis test measures your blood sugar level at a single point in time. For the most reliable results, you need to fast for at least 8 hours first. It\u2019s best to stop eating at night and then have your test first thing in the morning.\n\nResults of less than 100 mg/dL are considered normal.\n\nResults from 100 -125 mg/dL could indicate prediabetes, and results greater than 126 mg/dL mean diabetes. (Doctors will often order two tests to confirm.)\n\nRandom Blood Sugar Test\n\nThis test is similar to the fasting blood sugar test, but instead of avoiding food for 8 hours before your test, you can do it no matter when you last ate.\n\nResults of 200 mg/dL or higher signal diabetes.\n\nOral Glucose Tolerance Test\n\nThis test takes about two hours. After an initial blood test, you have a sugary drink, wait 2 hours and get tested again. This provides an excellent look at how your body has processed and responded to the sugar.\n\nAgain, additional tests might be ordered to provide more information to patients who have prediabetes or diabetes. Results less than 140 mg/dL are normal, between 140-199 mg/dL signal prediabetes, and equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL indicate diabetes.\n\nOther Important Diabetes Tests\n\nAlong with your other tests, you should discuss these additional recommended tests with your doctor:\n\nEye exam with dilation. High blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in your eyes, which can lead to diabetic retinopathy. Your eye doctor will probably check for damaged blood vessels during your regular exam. Check, just in case.\n\nPodiatry exam. Diabetes can slow circulation to your extremities, leading to loss of feeling (neuropathy). A podiatrist can check for cracks, redness, sores, nerve damage, and other abnormalities.\n\nTests for Cholesterol\n\nWe used to blame cholesterol for the plaque and clogged arteries that caused heart trouble, weight problems, and strokes.\n\nWe now know we were only half right. There are two different kinds of cholesterol.\n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) is absolutely essential to good health, so we call it \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol. Our bodies use the sun\u2019s UV rays to convert HDL into vitamin D3 and to produce other vital hormones.\n\nLow-density lipoprotein, (LDL) on the other hand, does clog our arteries, playing a significant role in heart diseases and other health threats.\n\nWhen you have your cholesterol levels checked, as part of a lipid blood panel, your lab or doctor will use your scores to determine your relative risk of heart disease\u2014your total cholesterol ratio.\n\nGood Ratio? 5 to 1 or lower. Optimal ratio? 3.5 to 1.\n\nTriglycerides\n\nThe lipid blood panel also tests for triglycerides, the fats created as our foods are broken down, converted into sugar, used for fuel, and stored in our bodies as fat.\n\nTriglycerides have two essential jobs:\n\nTransport oxygen throughout our bodies, a health-or-illness matter for every cell we\u2019ve got. Serve as a reserve store of fat, which our bodies tap into when we need energy but no food is available for fuel.\n\nA healthy triglyceride count means not too low, which can slow or stall those oxygen transport duties, and not too high, which can lead to excess fat buildup. This can lead, of course, to weight gain, pre-diabetes and diabetes, heart disease, and all the usual bad outcomes.\n\nTriglycerides results:\n\nHealthy : Below 150 mg/dL (1.70 mmol/L)\n\n: Below 150 mg/dL (1.70 mmol/L) Borderline high : 150-199 mg/dL(1.7-2.2 mmol/L)\n\n: 150-199 mg/dL(1.7-2.2 mmol/L) High : 200-499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L)\n\n: 200-499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L) Very high: Above 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)\n\nTests for cancer\n\nOur US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that these vital tests are being skipped by an alarming and growing number of adults.\n\nIn 2013:\n\n20 percent of women were not up to date with cervical cancer screening\n\n25 percent of women were not up to date with breast cancer screening\n\n40 percent of adults were not up to date with colorectal cancer screening\n\nThis is playing with fire, and for no good reason\u2014most insurance covers these screenings, usually at 100 percent. And for the uninsured, clinics across the country offer screenings for no or minimal cost.\n\nCurrently, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends the following schedule:\n\nColorectal cancer: Starting at age 50 using either fecal occult blood testing (yearly), sigmoidoscopy (every 5 years), or colonoscopy (every 10 years).\n\nCervical cancer: Start at age 21 using a Pap test, every 3 years.\n\nBreast cancer: Starting at age 50, every 2 years, alternating traditional mammography with thermography, to reduce radiation exposure from mammography.\n\nDepending on many factors\u2014genetics, family and personal history, current state of health\u2014you might need additional, or more frequent, tests, including one that many physicians recommend for all patients. It\u2019s called the Creatine Reactive Protein, or CRP, test.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple but wide-ranging blood test that looks all over your body for this protein\u2014which is always present where there\u2019s inflammation. Elevated CRP levels doesn\u2019t immediately mean there\u2019s cancer\u2014something else could be causing the inflammation, which is the start point for nearly every disease we know.\n\nBut chronically elevated CRP always means something is wrong, and you should rule out cancer before anything else.\n\nFor patients with chronically elevated levels of CRP (score above 1), a high risk for cancer, or other test results signaling trouble, an oncoblot test is in order. It looks for the enox2 protein, which is produced by malignant cancer cells. If you test positive, then you search immediately for the source of the cancer. The test can identify the presence of 26 types of cancer.\n\nAnother test looks for circulating tumor cells (CTC.) These are the cancer cells produced by a tumor\u2014and cut loose into the bloodstream to find vulnerable cells, like at inflammation sites\u2014where they dig in and replicate the \u201cparent\u201d tumor. This is metasticy, and it\u2019s major, major trouble.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nThe bad news is, you can have CTC or enox2 proteins in your body for years, and never know it. Don\u2019t get ambushed.\n\nTests for prostate cancer\n\nFor decades, the PSA test for prostate health was the go-to routine. But evidence kept arriving that put a stop to that. There were too many men who were told that their PSA test showed they needed a biopsy to find the presence of threatened or threatening cells. But biopsy after painful, hit-or-miss biopsy found no evidence of precancerous or cancerous cells. The PSA test lost its go-to status.\n\nOther data found that prostate cancer is, thankfully, a very slow moving variety. Even men in their 60s were more likely to die with prostate cancer than because of it.\n\nThat said, prostate cancer remains the second most frequent killer of men, among cancers (following lung cancer).\n\nToday, we have a more reliable test for prostate cancer called gene3 (PCA3). All it takes is a urine test that looks for active genes found only in prostate cancer cells. In 95 percent of diagnosed prostate cancer cases, those active gene3 cells were highly visible.\n\nIn those cases, another test is in order. The Color Doppler Ultrasound exam is non-invasive, painless, and takes only about 30 minutes. It spots prostate tumors\u2014even identifies the type, location, and stage\u2014and other abnormalities.\n\nEven if tumors are found, it\u2019s not yet time for treatment.\n\nMany, but not all, physicians recommend starting with a PSA test for a benchmark, then getting another one after a year to highlight changes, if any. Only if changes are significant should the additional tests we\u2019ve just covered be prescribed.\n\nTests for oral health\n\nOur mouths are more vulnerable to serious health threats than most people realize. Unlike our skin, a barrier between the toxin-rich outside world and the wet, \u201craw\u201d tissue beneath it, our mouths are pretty much nothing but raw tissue. Every breath, bite, or swallow we take is swarming with pathogens.\n\nMaking matters worse, our delicate oral tissues are easily damaged. Bleeding gums after flossing or brushing? Hello, bacteria and inflammation, welcome to our systems.\n\nIndeed, poor oral health can be a player in diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and more. People with periodontal diseases have up to a 46 percent greater chance of dying than those with healthy gums.\n\nOur mouths are target-rich, vulnerable to cancers of the lips, tongue, cheeks, floor of the mouth, hard and soft palate, sinuses, and pharynx (throat). These can be life threatening if not diagnosed and treated early.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends oral cancer screening exams annually for those older than age 40.\n\nHow Is Oral Cancer Diagnosed?\n\nYour routine dental exam should include oral cancer screening. Your dentist should watch for and manually feel for sores or discolored tissue, lumps, irregular tissue changes under your tongue and the linings of the cheeks, and in your neck, head, face, and oral cavity.\n\nThe most common symptoms of oral cancer include:\n\nSwellings/thickenings, lumps or bumps, rough spots/crusts/or eroded areas on the lips, gums, or other areas inside the mouth\n\nVelvety white, red, or speckled (white and red) patches\n\nUnexplained bleeding\n\nUnexplained numbness, loss of feeling, or pain/tenderness in any area of the face, mouth, or neck\n\nPersistent sores on the face, neck, or mouth that bleed easily and do not heal within 2 weeks\n\nSoreness or feeling that something is caught in the back of the throat\n\nDifficulty chewing or swallowing, speaking, or moving the jaw or tongue\n\nHoarseness, chronic sore throat, or change in voice\n\nEar pain\n\nA change in the way your teeth or dentures fit together\n\nDramatic weight loss\n\nAny of these symptoms should be considered a signal, not a green light, of the need for a biopsy. That\u2019s never a decision to be taken lightly. A traditional biopsy is a painful, hit-or-miss procedure with mixed success. Fortunately, there are ways to get the information needed that are far less invasive\u2014using lasers, for example, or swabs and screens to test your mouth for dangerous bacteria. Make sure your doctor knows about these alternatives before deciding which procedure is best.\n\nTo really stay in touch with your oral health, conduct a self-exam at least once a month. Using a bright light and a mirror:\n\nLook at and feel your lips and the front of your gums\n\nTilt your head back and look at and feel the roof of your mouth\n\nPull your checks out to see the inside of your mouth, the lining of your cheeks, and the back gums\n\nPull out your tongue and look at all surfaces, including under the tongue\n\nExamine the floor of your mouth\n\nLook at the back of your throat\n\nFeel for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes in both sides of your neck and under your lower jaw\n\nSelf-exams don\u2019t excuse you from regular dentist visits. Danger spots in the mouth can be very tiny and difficult to see on your own.\n\nCall your dentist immediately if you notice any changes in the appearance of gums and tongue.\n\nTests for vision\n\nBelieve it or not, as we age, more of us suffer some degree of vision loss than hearing or cognitive function.\n\nOn the menu of unhappy outcomes:\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD)\n\nCataracts\n\nDiabetic eye disease\n\nGlaucoma\n\nDry eye\n\nLow vision\n\nBlindness\n\nThe first thing we want to test for, and correct, is signs of macular degeneration, the most common type of vision loss.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the exact causes, but we know you\u2019re more susceptible if you\u2019re:\n\nOlder than 50\n\nA smoker, overweight, or diabetic\n\nEating unhealthy food\n\nAdditional risk factors:\n\nLight eyes and fair skin\n\nHistory of cataracts\n\nFemale\n\nThere are two types of AMD\u2014early and late.\n\nIn early AMD, your sight is unaffected, so you have no idea your vision is threatened. Only your eye care professional can detect the early signals, so regular eye exams are critical.\n\nSome people with early AMD develop late AMD, where loss of vision can begin.\n\nLate AMD can be either dry or wet AMD.\n\nDry AMD is more common\u2014around 85 percent of people with late AMD have this type. Fortunately, it\u2019s the less severe type\u2014vision deteriorates slowly, over a longer period of time.\n\nWith wet AMD, vision degenerates more rapidly. It\u2019s caused by abnormal blood vessels that bleed and leak fluid, causing distorted vision.\n\nGlaucoma is another common condition that can hide for years before showing symptoms. Glaucoma is a buildup of pressure inside your eye. When this intraocular pressure damages the optic nerve, its ability to transmit images to your brain is impeded. If the damage continues, it can lead to permanent vision loss, even blindness, within just a few years.\n\nThere are two types of glaucoma. Open-angle or wide-angle glaucoma is the most common type. It occurs when your eye\u2019s drainage network prevents fluid from flowing out properly.\n\nAngle-closure glaucoma (or acute, chronic or narrow-angle glaucoma) is caused by the eye\u2019s drainage passageway narrowing. This can cause a buildup of ocular fluid and pressure in your eye. Obstructed drainage is also linked to cataracts, a clouding of the lens inside your eye.\n\nWhen you\u2019re tested, your eye doctor will use drops to open your pupils. He or she will check your optic nerve for signs of glaucoma, and do a tonometry test to check your eye pressure. He might also do a visual field test to see if you\u2019ve lost peripheral vision.\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to get glaucoma if you:\n\nAre of African-American, Irish, Russian, Japanese, Hispanic, Inuit, or Scandinavian descent\n\nAre over 40\n\nHave a family history of glaucoma\n\nHave poor vision\n\nHave diabetes\n\nTake certain steroid medications, like prednisone\n\nHave had trauma to the eye or eyes\n\nDon\u2019t avoid these tests. They\u2019re painless and take very little time.\n\nTests for hearing\n\nHearing loss already affects roughly one-third of Baby Boomers older than 65. And as they continue to age, it\u2019s inevitable that many more will join their ranks.\n\nThe microscopic, hair-like cells in our ears, inside the cochlea, serve to receive and transmit to the brain every sound we hear.\n\nThese tiny hairs can be damaged by:\n\nFree radicals\n\nNoise\n\nSome drugs\n\nCirculatory problems\n\nSome diseases\n\nInfections\n\nGenetics\n\nLack of antioxidants\n\nThere are 5 common tests audiologists use to diagnose hearing loss:\n\nPure-tone test\n\nSpeech test\n\nMiddle ear test\n\nAuditory brainstem response\n\nOtoacoustic emissions\n\nThe Pure-Tone test determines the highest and lowest sounds you can hear compared to normal hearing.\n\nThe Speech test has you listen on headphones to conversation in quiet and noisy environments. This helps determine your speech reception threshold, that is, how well you can pick up words in those environments.\n\nThe Middle Ear test involves pushing air into your ear, causing the eardrum to vibrate. Measuring the vibration helps identify problems like a perforated eardrum or obstructions in the ear\u2019s ventilation tubes.\n\nThe Auditory Brainstem Response test provides data about the inner ear and the neural pathways necessary for hearing. You\u2019ll have electrodes on your head to record brain wave activity.\n\nThe Otoacoustic Emissions test identifies the various sounds produced by the inner ear when the cochlea are stimulated. The sounds are measured to pin down different types of hearing loss. You\u2019ll have a small probe inserted into the ear canal.\n\nThanks for getting the message\n\nI hope these recommendations make 2019 a great year for building health and happiness for many years to come. Always make sure you and your doctor(s) are on the same page when it comes to which tests happen when.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
