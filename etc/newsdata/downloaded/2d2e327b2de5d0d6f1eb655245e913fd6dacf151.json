Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have long been a favourite ransom tender for cyber criminals thanks to the currencies' anonymous nature.\n\nSpain's interior ministry has sent three computer experts to Jerez de la Frontera, a city of some 212,000 residents which is the home of sherry, to help the municipality resolve the cyber attack, the city's authorities said in a statement.\n\nIts Socialist mayor, Mamem Sanchez, said the municipal website would only be back up and running when it is \"100% secure\".\n\nWhile law enforcement and security experts say it is unwise to pay hackers, many organisations end up accepting ransom demands which often cost less than rebuilding computer systems.", "description": "A hacker has taken over the computer system of a Spanish city and is demanding a ransom paid in bitcoin to unlock it, say local officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8178/599c16c30025437383ea030c3e246f9b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
