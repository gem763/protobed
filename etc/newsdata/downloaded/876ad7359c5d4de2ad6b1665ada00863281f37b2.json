That's when she was approached by a man who reprimanded her.\n\nOutrage: Tracy Bennett from Raleigh, North Carolina, has revealed a stranger shamed her for being on her phone in Costco when her sons Elliot, two, and Isaac, seven months, were fussing\n\n'You see these babies? They fuss like that because they want your attention. Maybe you should get off of your phone and give them your attention,' he said, according to her viral post that was shared on the Breastfeeding Mama Talk Facebook page.\n\nTracy told Today that she acted defensively in the moment and explained that she was trying to get her boys out of the line as quickly as possible. When she got home, she wrote all of the things she wished she had said to him.\n\nAt the start of her open letter, she pointed out all of the moments the man missed before he decided to share his two cents about her parenting skills.\n\n'First of all, I had no idea the toddler saying, \"Mama, pizza, mama, pizza\" over and over and the baby making pre-cry warnings to alert me that if we don\u2019t move soon he\u2019s [going] to lose it wanted my attention. Thank you for that brilliant analysis of the situation,' she wrote.\n\n'Secondly, I had been in the Membership line for 15 minutes already. I pulled out books, snacks, patty cake, and even took to creepily pointing out items in buggies as customers left the store to entertain them,' she continued.\n\n'Thirdly, you had been in the Refunds line next to me for a total of two minutes or else you would have seen the smiles and laughs and interaction. Lastly, after 15 minutes, these babies got a bit fussy. And on the meltdown scale, they were barely even at a 1.'\n\nTake a seat: In her open letter, the mother-of-two stressed that people should mind their own business if they have 'nothing kind or supportive to offer'\n\nTracy said was 'sensing the meltdown brewing' when she took out her phone, downloaded the Costco app, and texted her husband to ask what their log information is.\n\n'I ran out of tricks and my kids ran out of patience and now my goal was to just get us out of this line as quickly as possible before they released the kraken,' she explained.\n\n'But thank you for your parenting advice. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to shame a young mother with two tiny children. Thank you for seeing a stressful moment and deciding, \"I think I\u2019ll make this worse for her.\"'\n\nTracy went on to say that whenever you see a mother or father out in public with young children, you should assume they are 'stressed out' and trying their 'damnedest to get through the situation.'\n\n'Assume this is the very last place she wants to be. Assume she\u2019d rather be home cuddling, playing, running around with her babies,' she advised. 'Assume she probably has had no sleep since her first child was born.\n\n'Assume she is hungry because her toddler decided he wanted extra eggs this morning so she gave him her breakfast in addition to his own. And if you have nothing kind or supportive to offer her, please mind your own business.'\n\nGoing viral: The post has received hundreds of comments since it was shared last month, with many people offering their sympathies and sharing their own mom-shaming stories\n\n'Our babies are healthy, our babies are happy (despite the fact that they are not currently pleased with standing in line at Costco), and our babies are loved fiercely by us. And for the love of God, our babies can wait 2 minutes while we try to solve a problem on your phone,' she wrote at the end of her letter.\n\nThe post has received hundreds of comments since it was shared last month, with many people offering their sympathies and sharing their own mom-shaming stories.\n\n'No one knows their children more than their mama,' one woman wrote. 'Strangers have no idea how our days go. When they say things like this it drives me crazy!! Sorry you went through this. I would be sooooo upset.'\n\n'I was in a grocery store looking at my phone because my aunt had sent me a text with a list,' another woman recalled. 'Some old man was walking by and I looked up. He was looking at me so I smiled at him politely. He proceeded to say \"all of you are addicts and just can't put technology down.\" I almost threw a cantaloupe at him.'\n\nTracy told Today that reading the post's comments has made her feel 'supported and united' with other moms.\n\n'Motherhood is hard and it takes a lot of people telling you that you're not ruining your children's lives and sharing their own hot messes for you to feel like you're doing OK,' she said.\n\n'And, even outside motherhood, I don't understand why people want to tear each other down \u2014 what good comes from that?'", "description": "Tracy Bennett from Raleigh, North Carolina, penned an open letter to the man that was shared on the Breastfeeding Mama Talk Facebook page.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19563666-0-image-a-91_1570749807784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
