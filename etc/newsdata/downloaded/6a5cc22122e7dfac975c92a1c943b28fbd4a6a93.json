He was always so good to me, so protective. But I never got to pay him back. I\u2019ve returned to that memory a lot over the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cThese are thoughts I haven\u2019t yet been able to process properly. I\u2019m not sure I ever will.\u201d\n\nSacoolas was believed to be driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit Harry on August 27 outside RAF Croughton in Northants, where her husband worked in US intelligence.\n\nShe claimed diplomatic immunity from prosecution and later flew home.\n\nThe US government have refused to send her back to the UK, despite the Dunn family appealing directly to \u00adPresident Donald Trump .\n\nNiall said: \u201cWhen we were told Anne Sacoolas had immunity it was a punch in the face.\n\n\"It was really difficult hearing that and knowing we had nowhere left to go, nothing left to do.\u201d\n\nHe told how it was like the US telling the family: \u201cTough, she\u2019s not coming back. Go away and cry at home.\u201d\n\nCharlotte, husband Bruce and Harry\u2019s dad Tim are trying to a launch civil case against Sacoolas in a US court.", "description": "Niall Dunn, the younger twin by two minutes, revealed he was having his asthma attack in bed and Harry woke up their mum Charlotte who dialled 999", "authors": ["Amy Coles"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735796.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-27-at-135253JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
