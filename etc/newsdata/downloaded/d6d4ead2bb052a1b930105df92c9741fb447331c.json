And It had nothing to do with the first baseball World Series game in Washington since 1933.\n\nInstead, the Defense Department announced the winner of its huge $10 billion cloud computing contract. The winner: Microsoft. The software giant upset Amazon.com and its Amazon Web Services division to take the government cloud crown.\n\nThe \u201ccloud\u201d is a term referring to moving applications and data storage off local hardware and onto the web, so both can be accessed and analyzed by any device connected to the internet. And the U.S. government is getting into the cloud.\n\n(By the way, you have to give the Pentagon points for creativity. The contract is called JEDI, short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.)\n\n\u201cThe National Defense Strategy dictates that we must improve the speed and effectiveness with which we develop and deploy modernized technical capabilities to our women and men in uniform,\u201d Dana Deasy, the chief information officer for the Department of Defensesaid in a statement. \u201cThe DoD Digital Modernization Strategy was created to support this imperative. This award is an important step in execution of the Digital Modernization Strategy.\u201d\n\nIt is important for the tech giants, too.\n\nThe JEDI contract is \u201cthe biggest cloud deal for the space to date, a game-changer,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron\u2019s when Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) were announced as contract finalists earlier this year. What\u2019s more, the $10 billion figure represents the tip of the ice berg.\n\n\u201cBezos and Nadella are both laser focused on this cloud opportunity in the DoD and other agencies to successfully capture what could cumulatively be a $100 billion cloud market opportunity over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote in a Friday research report.\n\nThe loss hurts, but Amazon as well as Oracle (ORCL), International Business Machines (IBM) and Dell Technologies (DELL) still have big government cloud opportunities, according to Ives. The importance of the cloud will continue to grow for big tech for years.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft and Nadella are popping the Champagne tonight in Redmond, while Bezos and Amazon are likely shocked they lost the World Series of cloud deals,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nNow, Washington National fans hope there are more Champagne corks to pop before the weekend\u2019s out. Games 4 and 5 of the best-of-seven World Series are Saturday and Sunday nights. The Nats are up on the Astros, 2 games to 1.\n\nMicrosoft stock rose 2.4% the past week, better than the 0.7% gain of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Amazon stock rose 0.2%. Both Amazon and Microsoft reported third-quarter results last week.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com", "description": "The Pentagon has awarded Microsoft a $10 billion cloud contract, spurning Amazon.com.
