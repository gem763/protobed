In the same way that it\u2019s harder to care about statistics (like the proportion of rapes being prosecuted in England and Wales dropping to just 1.7%) than stories (like the new book by Chanel Miller, a blistering account of her sexual assault), perhaps it is easier to think of rape in these terms. As a horror show, unfolding.\n\nYesterday over lunch I read the news that, as Carl Beech was jailed after fabricating claims of historical rape, a former High Court judge concluded that the \u201cinstruction to believe a victim\u2019s account should cease.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I said aloud, darkly over tea. This came after the End Violence Against Women coalition (EVAW) pointed out that, judging by the woefully low rate of prosecutions, rape appears to have been decriminalised, an idea that continues to roll around my mind like a marble. Along with the ancient image of a thong.\n\nWhere once victims were humiliated in court by defence barristers holding up the underwear they wore on the night of the attack, today they are presented with old text messages or photos, which do the same job as the asking-for-it underwear, but in higher resolution. I spent my journey home reading Miller\u2019s book and that night lay in bed watching Unbelievable, the Netflix true-crime drama based on a teenager whose rape was discounted by detectives. I slept, not well.\n\nBoth Miller\u2019s book, Know My Name, and Netflix\u2019s Unbelievable shine a torch on the reality of sexual assault today, at a time when rape charges, prosecutions and convictions in England and Wales are at their lowest levels in more than a decade. Until recently, Miller was known as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, the pseudonym of the \u201cBrock Turner sexual assault victim\u201d. Her case first became famous because of widespread public criticism of the judgment. Despite there being witnesses to the assault, as Miller lay unconscious behind some bins after a frat party at Stanford University and despite Turner being convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault, he was sentenced to only six months in prison, of which he served three. The judge said he feared a longer sentence would have a \u201csevere impact\u201d on Turner, a \u201cpromising athlete\u201d. And second, because of Miller\u2019s powerful, detailed, victim statement. \u201cI was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn\u2019t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me.\u201d There are echoes of Miller\u2019s experience in Unbelievable, as there are, inevitably, in all accounts of violence against women. The series opens with Marie\u2019s rape and unravels from there, as minor inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s story lead police to charge her with false reporting, before it becomes clear that the rapist has attacked again.\n\nThe stories impact our understanding of how stereotypes skew ideas of what makes a plausible victim\n\nThese sharp-edged pieces of\u2026 entertainment, story-telling that illuminates the life of an assault victim, do two things, as well as keep us up at night, teeth ground to Tic Tacs. They impact our understanding of how status, stereotypes and trauma affect a case, thereby, hopefully, upsetting juries\u2019 skewed ideas of what makes a plausible victim. And they reflect a huge ongoing social change (where women are not only recognising assault, but demanding that institutions name it) and the shameful inability of the justice system to keep up with it.\n\nEVAW is suing the Crown Prosecution Service, claiming it has covertly changed its policy and practice in relation to decision-making on rape cases, leading to the shocking fall in charges: the number of cases charged has dropped 51% across five years. At any other time, such a crisis in prosecutions would be argued on the front benches, but it\u2019s a Brexit casualty. \u201cTumbleweed,\u201d EVAW\u2019s co-director Sarah Green said, over a bad phone line. She is clear too, though, that despite their current legal proceedings, rape will never be stopped through the justice system. The answers are in addressing the scale of sexual violence, with elected leaders understanding their responsibilities, with thoughtful interventions in schools, the welfare system, hospitals. With compulsory sex education that means porn isn\u2019t a child\u2019s default teacher on what sex is, who sex is for. With programmes on what consent looks like, on the impact of harassment in public places, the way it forces women to avoid the dark, or take the longer route home.\n\nI\u2019m often left hoppy and bitter when rape is a theme in my nightly telly, another body, another drink. But lately that agitation has moved upwards, to a place where I can recognise it as energy. As something useful, even positive. Horror stories rarely have happy endings, but it does feel, doesn\u2019t it, that a change is due. As grim and worrying as the figures are, the swell of social change, and the new clarity of storytelling, must, surely, drag the rest of the world along with it.\n\nEmail Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman", "description": "TV shows and books dealing with rape and sexual assault make for upsetting and unsettling viewing and reading, but at least the grim stories are propelling us towards the possibility of social change, says Eva Wiseman", "authors": ["Eva Wiseman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba92755ba2e0915d93ffdde975a668d132b1ecc/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8f8ebf4283ccb08be9294ff8ae6451c6", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
