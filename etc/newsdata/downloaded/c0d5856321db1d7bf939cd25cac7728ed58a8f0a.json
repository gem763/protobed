Gross domestic product expanded at a 6% pace in the third quarter, the slowest in 27 years.\n\n\u201cThis provides more evidence that the trade war is taking a toll on growth,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com. Still, \u201cthe more up-to-date data showed industrial production rose a surprisingly large 5.8% [year-on-year] rise last month when expectations were for a smaller 5.0% increase.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndustrial output has therefore grown at a faster pace for the first time in three months, but [it] remains to be seen whether this spike is just an outlier...or the start of something more profound,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery CLX19, -0.32% fell by 15 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $53.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, prompting the U.S. benchmark to post a 1.7% weekly decline, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The global benchmark, as measured by December Brent crude BRNZ19, -0.34%, lost 49 cents, or 0.8%, at $59.42 a barrel, off 1.8% for the week.\n\nRead: Why the IMO 2020 marine fuel sulfur limit will hurt consumers\n\nFor now, it appears that \u201coil prices have stabilized over the past couple of weeks,\u201d said Razaqzada. \u201cDuring this period, we have also seen equity prices rise noticeably as a result of optimism over the US-China trade situation and Brexit.\u201d Front-month Brent oil futures trade roughly 2.2% lower month to date, but was up more than 10% for the year so far.\n\nPrices posted gains on Thursday despite the Energy Information Administration reporting a larger-than-expected rise in crude stocks last week of 9.3 million barrels, though a fall in refinery activity led to a strong draw on gasoline and distillate inventories, which fell 2.6 million barrels and 3.8 million barrels, respectively.\n\nSeparately, data from Baker Hughes BHGE, +0.76% released Friday showed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil edged up for a second week in a row.\n\nRazaqzada warned that \u201cfurther sharp increases in crude stocks, if seen, may keep price gains [for oil] in check, although ongoing intervention from the OPEC+ group means the downside will be limited as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, overall, we are talking about a range-bound market, but with prices being near the range lows, the probability of a several-dollar rally has now increased,\u201d he said.\n\nPrices got a boost late in Thursday\u2019s trading session after news that the U.S. and Turkey reached a case-fire pact in Syria, temporarily easing Middle East tensions. A tentative Brexit deal, meanwhile, fueled appetite for asset perceived as risky, though the deal must still be approved by the British parliament and other EU member states.\n\nBack on Nymex, prices for petroleum products barely budged for the session, with November gasoline RBX19, -0.42% adding 0.03% to $1.623 a gallon, for a weekly loss of 1%, while November heating oil HOX19, -0.16% shed 0.05% to $1.9471 a gallon, down 0.5% for the week.\n\nNovember natural gas NGX19, -0.73% edged up by nearly 0.1% at $2.32 per million British thermal units, tallying a weekly rise of 4.8%.\n\nA storm in the Gulf of Mexico, dubbed potential tropical cyclone sixteen by the National Hurricane Center, was expected to bring tropical storm force winds along portions of the Northern Gulf Coast later Friday. The storm, for now, has no apparent impact on oil and natural-gas operations in the Gulf.", "description": "Oil futures finish lower on Friday, giving up earlier gains to build a loss for the week, as data showing slower Chinese economic growth fed worries about...", "authors": ["Myra P.
