So ensure you include two cups of a variety of colourful, non-starchy veggies too,' she said.\n\nIf you don't have time to make a full meal after a workout than opt for a snack from the pre-workout list.", "description": "A leading Australian dietitian has revealed exactly what she would eat before and after a workout to maintain energy for the rest of the day.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/02/19816390-0-image-a-190_1571275706082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
