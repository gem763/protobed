Among the previously unreported revelations are Falwell\u2019s decision to hire his son Trey\u2019s company to manage a shopping center owned by the university, Falwell\u2019s advocacy for loans given by the university to his friends, and Falwell\u2019s awarding university contracts to businesses owned by his friends.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a school; we\u2019re a real estate hedge fund,\u201d said a senior university official with inside knowledge of Liberty\u2019s finances. \u201cWe\u2019re not educating; we\u2019re buying real estate every year and taking students\u2019 money to do it.\u201d\n\nLiberty employees detailed other instances of Falwell\u2019s behavior that they see as falling short of the standard of conduct they expect from conservative Christian leaders, from partying at nightclubs, to graphically discussing his sex life with employees, to electioneering that makes uneasy even those who fondly remember the heyday of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr., the school\u2019s founder and Falwell Jr.\u2019s father, and his Moral Majority.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brandon Ambrosino", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
