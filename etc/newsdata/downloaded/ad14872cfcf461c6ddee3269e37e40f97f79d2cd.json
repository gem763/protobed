And it remains the same irrespective of the period you want to keep the furniture. What so special about renting? Well, other than flexibility which is a default feature of renting, its easy on your pockets without compromising of quality and its completely hassle-free. When you buy the right quality of furniture, you have to invest a lot of money and effort. This is something we all know. But the most critical point we miss here is, after buying any costly furniture, you get stuck. Keeping it with you for a long time is the only way to get a justified value of money. But what about the trends and styles which are rapidly changing and quirky new concepts of modern furniture society is adapting every day. Everybody wants that. Your financial liability also multiples many times and the urge to maintain the furniture in the best way possible makes you work extra hard. The doomed resale furniture market pushes us towards another most unwanted thing. Stay with the same piece as long as possible.\n\nAs we observed that not only buying and maintaining is a tedious job, but re-selling at any point of time also a depressing event. As you all know, furniture depreciates quickly, and resale value of it remains hardly one-fifth of its original cost even if you are selling only after using for a couple of years. If the furniture is a bit old or a bit damaged, it's worse. Buyers would try to bargain hard and pay only one-tenth of the value you actually paid initially. That's why buying limits your choices. But when you rent furniture, the situation is quite the opposite. You don't have to invest a significant amount, you get it delivered at your doorstep for free, and once you don't want to use it anymore, free pickup is just phone call away. Whenever you want to get rid of the whole set-up due to any reason just cancel your subscription and a trained team of professionals would come to pick everything in no time.\n\nRenting Is Real SavingA little comparison for all of us. Let's take a bed, for example. Comparison between buying and renting for a period of 10 years.\n\nBuying a Queen Bed Bed Purchase Price \u2013 30,000 INR\n\nincome Lost \u2013 36,000 INR (@ 10% Annual)\n\nRefurbishment Cost \u2013 3000 INR\n\nRelocation Cost \u2013 5,000 INR-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEffective Cost- 74000/- INR-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRenting a Queen Bed\n\nRent Paid \u2013 60,000 INR.\n\nInterest Income Lost - 0.00 INR (@ 10% Annual)\n\nRefurbishment Cost \u2013 0.00 INR\n\nRelocation Cost \u2013 0.00 INR\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Effective Cost- 60000/-INR Effective Saving- 14000/- Who could have imagined?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDepreciation & How It Draws Us Down Any kind of furniture doesn't matter how classy it is or how new it is or how well kept it is, hardly fetches one-third of its original value only after a couple of years of use. It is not fair, but that's how the market works. The majority of users prefer a reasonably priced new bed instead of a costly second-hand one. Even if they have to compromise on looks and quality. In other words, buying furniture is like losing money in a bet you knew would be a bad deal even before you made it. And there is more to consider-\n\n1- Refurnish Facility Every Year\n\nRenting allows refurnishing to your place every year. You don't need any special occasion to put more life into your home. Just choose anything from latest designs and enjoy the whole new experience of brand new furniture in the most stylish way. No extra money spent, no effort of getting the delivery and having the old furniture picked-up and\n\nno more stress of handling the whole thing if you decide to move again. It's just fun.\n\n2 - Unwanted Circumstance Due to some reason, your sofa got spoiled or got damaged. Neighbours' kids, thick gravy or red wine. You avoided the stains as long as you could but finally decided to get rid of it. What will be the resale value you imagine you will get? Let's assume that the original cost was around 1 lakh rupees, it would hardly sell in about 35000 to 40000 rupees. The hassle of finding the buyer and getting the sofa delivered would eat up many of your weekends. But if you have got furniture on rent you can return everything by just making a phone call and either get a new one or just take some time and think over all of your options. It is evident that accidents can happen with rented furniture also, but you will be charged with a very nominal amount for the damage after proper inspection. 3 - Sudden Requirement Of Shifting You have to move to a new city in one week, the buyer will sense your urgency and would make an offer of around one-third of the actual value of any piece of furniture you are willing to sell. Don't you believe me? Try it yourself and see. And let's not forget the hassle of finding the buyer, parading your goods in front of them and getting the delivery done. While there are thousands of other things waiting to be done. And if your furniture needs to be dismantled before transferring, that's entirely another level of pain. With rented furniture, there is no hassle. Just call the company and get rid of it. 4\u2014 The Urge To Stay Trendy If you like to stay stylish than you are ultimately doomed if you have decided to buy. You buy the best looking furniture but immediately after a much better design was launched. It happens with cars all the time. Now what? You can't quickly decide to get the latest model as selling the old/new piece of furniture is a financial disaster. After selling you will have to buy the new design too. More financial burden. A significant amount of capital would be required again. But if you rent instead of buying, you can swap with the latest designs anytime without spending any extra amount. Keep changing with the\n\nchange and stay stylish.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by City Furnish covering: .
