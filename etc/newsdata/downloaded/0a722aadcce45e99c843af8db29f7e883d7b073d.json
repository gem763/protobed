The G-7 involves the heads of state for the world\u2019s allied economic powerhouses, including France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe nations rotate hosting duties, and Trump himself said early on he was interested in the United States inviting the nations to his 643-room golf resort, said Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. Though local authorities said they never were involved in a vetting process, Mulvaney said White House event planners screened a dozen potential sites.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent at the end of that process that Doral was by far and away the best physical facility for this meeting,\u201d Mulvaney told White House reporters Thursday morning. \u201cIn fact, I was talking to one of the advance teams when they came back and I said what was it like. He said, \u2018Mick, you\u2019re not going to believe this, but it\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event.\u2019\u201d\n\nExplore where you live.

Zilch,\u201d Miami-Dade police spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta said of the agency\u2019s communications with the Trump administration about a possible summit. The county\u2019s tax-funded tourism bureau typically plays a central role in reserving hotel-room blocs for major events, including December\u2019s Art Basel and the Super Bowl, which is coming to Miami Gardens in February.\n\nBut for the G-7 in June, the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau said it learned the event was coming from the news on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even looked at what\u2019s on the books that month,\u201d said bureau president Bill Talbert.\n\nA Gimenez spokeswoman said the White House contacted the county mayor about 45 minutes before the announcement. Thursday night, Gimenez said he spoke to Trump himself during a call the president made to the mayor when Hurricane Dorian threatened Miami on Aug. 30. \u201cHe said he was thinking about holding it in Miami-Dade, and I said we would be honored and that we would assist in any way possible,\u201d said Gimenez, who is considering a run for Congress as a Republican. \u201cI also told him we had experience with hosting large events.\u201d\n\nThe city of Doral confirmed its potential as G-7 host city when it called the Secret Service\u2019s Miami office four months ago after reading a news item about the possibility, Mayor Juan Carlos Bermudez said. A follow-up call with the White House, along with President Trump\u2019s own strong hints that Doral was the choice, prompted the city to assign an extra $270,000 to the city\u2019s police budget to cover security costs tied to the summit.\n\n\u201cWhen they reached out to us, we understood they felt very strongly it should be here,\u201d Bermudez said of the Trump administration.\n\nTrump has been floating the idea of a Doral summit for months, adding the G-7 event to the growing list of presidential activities overlapping with the president\u2019s hospitality portfolio. The Trump Organization bought the former Marriott out of bankruptcy in 2012, rebranding it as a Trump property after an extensive renovation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right next to the airport, meaning a few minutes away,\u201d Trump said at the end of the last G-7 summit in August, when asked about the possibility of the 2020 event heading for Doral. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place. It\u2019s got tremendous acreage. ... We can handle whatever happens. People are really liking it. Plus, it has buildings that have 50 to 75 units in them, so each delegation can have its own building. ... It\u2019s very big, a great conference facility.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s Miami. Doral, Miami,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great area.\u201d\n\nMiami has played host to presidential summits and diplomatic gatherings, but those events centered around the Americas. The most disruptive was the 2003 Free Trade Area of the Americas, a gathering of trade ministers that brought throngs of protesters and police to downtown Miami. In 1994, Bill Clinton and 33 heads of state from Chile, Peru and the other countries in the Western Hemisphere gathered for the three-day Summit of the Americas conference at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables.\n\nA G-7 summit would bring Miami to another level as a diplomatic venue, as it would play host to heads of state from leading economies across the world: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a first,\u201d said former Miami Mayor Tom\u00e1s Regalado, \u201cbecause of the importance of the G-7.\u201d\n\nThe notion of the president granting his own resort a global summit hosted by the government he runs has added fuel to the broader complaint that Trump is making money off his tenure in office. House Democrats last month announced a probe of White House decision-making on the G-7 summit as part of their inquiry into whether Trump is violating constitutional restrictions against accepting gifts from foreign governments.\n\nThe premise of the inquiry is that the summit would obligate foreign governments to pay for lodging and food that the Trump Doral would be selling them \u2014 money that makes its way up the ladder at the Trump Organization and eventually into the coffers of Trump himself. In his 2018 financial disclosure form required by the federal government, Trump stated he took in $76 million from the hotel and golf courses there.\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney tried to blunt the criticism by revealing the Trump Organization planned to put on the summit \u201cat cost,\u201d offering discounts to Washington that made the Doral \u201cdramatically cheaper\u201d as a summit location than other sites considered in Utah, Hawaii and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no profit here,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cHe\u2019s not making any money off of this just like he\u2019s not making any money off of working here.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in Florida praised the economic boost Trump was delivering with the summit location choice, while Democrats described scandal.\n\n\u201cAnytime you bring all these foreign leaders from the seven largest economies in the world to Florida I\u2019m going to be for it,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from West Miami. \u201cAnd a lot of people are going to benefit from it because there\u2019s no way that the hotel can accommodate\u201d the press, staff and other contingents that follow a summit to town.\n\n\u201cInstead of picking a location based on security priorities ... the President once again chose to use his office to enrich himself and help his failing businesses,\u201d Miami-Dade\u2019s Democratic Party said in a statement.\n\nThe landmark event for the Trump Doral follows a string of setbacks and bad publicity for Miami-Dade\u2019s fifth largest resort, a suburban cluster of hotel facilities, ballrooms and four golf courses.\n\nAmid controversy over Trump\u2019s harsh remarks about Mexicans crossing the border illegally during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Doral resort\u2019s signature golf tournament bolted for a new sponsorship deal that took it to Mexico. Once Trump won the White House, the hotel reported a sales slowdown compared to competitors.\n\nA November 2018 report analyzing debt backed by the Fontainebleau Resort in Miami Beach showed the Trump Doral as the lowest performing property among the six analyzed. While the average Fontainebleau room in 2017 produced $248 a day in revenue, the Trump Doral generated just $110 a day. The average for the set was $180 a day.\n\nLast year, a consultant working for the Trump Doral to lower the property\u2019s tax bill with Miami-Dade produced documents showing the resort trailing its competitors.\n\nProfits from the resort fell nearly 70 percent from 2015 to 2017, according to evidence provided by consultant Jessica Vachiratevanurak. She told Miami-Dade County that the resort was \u201cseverely under-performing\u201d and blamed the downfall on \u201csome negative connotation associated with the brand.\u201d The county agreed to drop the resort\u2019s value for 2018 from $110.3 million to $105.6 million. This year the Trump Organization has again appealed Miami-Dade\u2019s assessment of its value.\n\nTrump himself has shown a decline in the resort\u2019s performance, too. While his 2018 disclosure showed him earning $76 million from the Trump Doral, that was down from $116 million in 2016.\n\nIn his press conference, Mulvaney said he was aware picking the president\u2019s hotel for the president\u2019s summit would open up the White House to \u201cpolitical criticism\u201d of self-dealing. But he also dismissed the idea that bringing the G-7 to Doral would be a boon. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s brand is probably strong enough as it is,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t need any help on that. It\u2019s the most recognizable name in the English language, and probably around the world right now.\u201d\n\nMiami Herald staff writers Alex Daugherty and Samantha Gross contributed to this report.", "description": "The G-7 will be held at President Donald Trump\u2019s Doral resort on June 10-12, 2020.
