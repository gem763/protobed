In the video, Halsey draws a beautiful girl into existence \u2014 played by Sydney Sweeney, a.k.a. Cassie in Euphoria \u2014 and the two run and interpretively dance through an amusement park, expressing something like attraction to one another. In addition to Cassie being on hand, it almost looks like Halsey chose a park extremely similar to the one featured in Euphoria\u2019s carnival episode. (Just without all that signature Sam Levinson night fog.) Considering that season one of the very emotional and stylized teen drama did end with Zendaya\u2019s Rue dancing through a big musical metaphor, \u201cGraveyard\u201d being an abandoned sequence from the Cassie-centric seventh episode of Euphoria feels entirely possible. In any case, this one is definitely for the Euphoria fans, Cassie sympathizers, and of course, Leonardo DiCaprio!\n\nRelated", "description": "The music video for Halsey\u2019s \u201cGraveyard\u201d features Sydney Sweeney, who plays Cassie in \u201cEuphoria,\u201d and basically looks like an outtake from the HBO show.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "ttp://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-halsey.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
