Getting on a plane is slower and more complicated than ever, with more travelers opting for carry-on bags in an expanding array of classes. London Gatwick airport is attempting a new timesaving solution to fix the problem: having passengers board the aircraft individually by seat number, sometimes from back to front.\n\n\u201cEarly indications are that this new technique has the potential to reduce the overall boarding time,\u201d Abhi Chacko, head of enabling technologies and digital innovation for Gatwick Airport, said in a news release. \u201cBy communicating to passengers better and boarding passengers by seat number, we also expect to make the whole boarding experience more relaxing and, potentially, prevent large numbers\u201d of passengers rushing forward at any stage.\n\n[Don\u2019t smile for surveillance: Why airport face scans are a privacy trap]\n\nThe plan isn\u2019t fully implemented but is, rather, a two-month experiment. Airport staff will test different boarding techniques to see what works best not only for speed but also for passengers\u2019 well-being. Gatwick, the Britain\u2019s second-largest airport, seeks a method that prevents groups of passengers from crowding the gate, which causies congestion and boarding slowdowns.\n\nOne trial will use digital displays at Gatwick\u2019s Gate 101 to inform passengers when to board, starting from the back row. Window seats will go first, followed by middle seats, then aisle. If all goes according to plan, the new techniques could cut boarding time by up to 10 percent.\n\nWhat will remain the same in Gatwick\u2019s temporary scheme is timing for travelers who have historically boarded first: Priority-class, young families and people who need special assistance will continue to be earliest.\n\n[The completely correct guide to getting off a plane]\n\nGatwick is just one player in the aviation industry working to make air travel more efficient. JetBlue and Delta are experimenting with facial-recognition technology to shave minutes off boarding. United and American Airlines are adding more overhead bin space to their planes to clear out logjams. Programs like Mobile Passport, CLEAR, Global Entry and TSA PreCheck are continuing to work on cutting down time spent in security and customs.\n\nIt remains to be seen which of the new approaches will be effective, but it seems things are trending in the right direction for faster boarding.\n\nRead more:\n\nAirline boarding is a mess.
