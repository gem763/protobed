They traded away some of their best players \u2014 left tackle Laremy Tunsil, wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Minkah Fitzpatrick \u2014 to stockpile draft picks. The \u201crace\u201d for the No. 1 choice in the 2020 draft could come down to the result of the Dec. 22 game in Miami between the Dolphins and the Cincinnati Bengals, who are currently 0-7.\n\nThe team with the top pick in next year\u2019s draft will have its choice of potential franchise quarterbacks, perhaps Alabama\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa or Oregon\u2019s Justin Herbert. The reward of finishing with the worst record in an NFL season is the guarantee of the draft\u2019s top selection. That\u2019s not so in the NBA, which has dealt with tanking allegations in a different way by having a lottery in which teams are encouraged to do their best to win games because even the franchise with the worst record in a season must take its chances when it comes to the draft order.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Dolphins have denied the tanking allegations. And indeed, there\u2019s no evidence that Coach Brian Flores and his players aren\u2019t doing all they can to try to win each game. Flores has gone back and forth between Ryan Fitzpatrick and Josh Rosen at quarterback. He went for a potential winning two-point conversion at the end of a near miss against the Washington Redskins. The Dolphins had a fourth-quarter lead Sunday in Buffalo before succumbing.\n\nThere\u2019s no disputing, however, that the team\u2019s front office has taken a bigger-picture view with the trades. So does that qualify as organizational tanking or merely being realistic and prudent?\n\nThe NFL is a league that thrives on its \u201cany given Sunday\u201d unpredictability and parity, based on the notion that the sport\u2019s overall prosperity is enhanced when fans in more cities are convinced that their teams have legitimate Super Bowl possibilities. The sharing of national TV revenue evenly between franchises keeps teams on relatively equal financial footing. The salary cap keeps spending on players fairly even. The scheduling formula and draft order also are components.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet even in a 2019 season in which TV viewership is on the upswing, there is a big disparity between a handful of have and have-not teams. At the top end, the New England Patriots have a record of 7-0 and an average victory margin of 25 points, the highest by an NFL team to this point in a season in the Super Bowl era. At the bottom end are the Dolphins, who suffered a 43-0 defeat to the Patriots in Week 2 in Miami, and the Bengals.\n\nThere also is a huge middle class of teams, though, in which anything still could happen.\n\n\u201cI think our competitiveness is really good,\u201d Atlanta Falcons President Rich McKay, the chairman of the NFL\u2019s rulemaking competition committee, said at the owners\u2019 meeting.\n\nAD\n\nMcKay said that the number of games decided by seven points or fewer was the most in league history through six weeks of a season.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s a good stat,\u201d McKay said. \u201cOur margin of victory is good. So we\u2019ve got a lot of good trends from a numbers standpoint.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that tanking allegations have surfaced in the NFL. There was, notably, the \u201cSuck for Luck\u201d talk when quarterback Andrew Luck, considered a once-in-a-generation NFL prospect, was to be available in the 2012 draft.\n\nThe reality is that the NFL draft remains a highly speculative venture, even when it comes to supposedly can\u2019t-miss quarterback prospects. Luck was taken first overall by the Indianapolis Colts in 2012 and replaced Peyton Manning, with owner Jim Irsay predicting multiple Super Bowl wins. And while Luck established himself as a top NFL quarterback, the Colts never so much as reached a Super Bowl with him before Luck announced his shocking retirement just before this season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe last 14 quarterbacks taken first overall in the NFL draft \u2014 since Manning in 1998 \u2014 are Baker Mayfield, Jared Goff, Jameis Winston, Luck, Cam Newton, Sam Bradford, Matthew Stafford, JaMarcus Russell, Alex Smith, Eli Manning, Carson Palmer, David Carr, Michael Vick and Tim Couch.\n\nThat list contains a mixture of successes and busts. Only one, Eli Manning, won a Super Bowl. So it is far from guaranteed that tanking works in the NFL, perhaps bolstering the case for Goodell\u2019s rejection of the NBA model.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed over the years. \u2026 I think from our standpoint, we find the draft to be successful on many fronts,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cOne, the competitive side, but also the event itself has grown dramatically. So it\u2019s not under active consideration. It hasn\u2019t been raised by either the [competition] committee or the clubs at this stage.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Commissioner Roger Goodell said last week that the league rejects allegations that Miami or any other NFL team is tanking.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tAfRAK4fJSr9F2wWQvldbnR3-dk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QLRMNRHN7YI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
