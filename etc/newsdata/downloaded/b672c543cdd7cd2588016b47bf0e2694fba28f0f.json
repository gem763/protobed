Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\nFox News Exclusive: Joe, Hunter Biden seen golfing with Ukraine gas company exec back in 2014, photo shows\n\nA photo obtained by Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" shows former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings with Hunter. Earlier this month, Joe Biden told Fox News in Iowa that he never discussed his son\u2019s foreign business dealings with him. \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Biden said, pointing the finger at President Trump. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader. You should be looking at Trump.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden told the New Yorker previously that he and his father had spoken \u201cjust once\u201d about his work in Ukraine. A source told Fox News the photo was taken in August 2014. News reports at the time indicated the vice president was in the Hamptons. Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma Holdings board in April 2014.

The report would appear to support Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani's claims on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that Pompeo was aware of his efforts to encourage Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the Bidens. Over the weekend, the Democratic chairmen of three House committees subpoenaed Pompeo for documents related to Ukraine they said were critical to their probe.\n\nHouse Democrats on Monday subpoenaed Giuliani's text messages, phone records, and other documents and communications as part of their formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. In an interview on \"Hannity,\" Giuliani blasted the Biden camp for apparently trying to \"silence\" him by encouraging media outlets not to book him as a guest. The former New York City mayor said the Democrats are going to turn into the \"party of corruption.\" Meanwhile, top Republicans are wondering whether Trump is a victim of a \"political setup\" by Democrats in the Ukraine call controversy, thanks to comments made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during her \"60 Minutes\" interview on Sunday.

But, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News it would be wrong to say Trump \"pressed\" the Australian prime minister for information that could have discredited former Special Counsel Mueller's now-completed probe, as the New York Times reported earlier Monday.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., slammed the Times report on \"Hannity,\" calling it an \"effort\" to shut down Barr's investigation.\n\nFox News Exclusive: WinRed, new GOP donor platform, reaps impeachment windfall, rakes in millions\n\nWinRed, the new GOP online fundraising platform designed to compete with Democrats in the battle for small-dollar campaign donations, has raised over $28 million since launching three months ago, with top officials crediting the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push for a big spike in fundraising over the last week, Fox News has learned. WinRed raised $28.1 million in the third fundraising quarter, which began in July and ended Monday. The online platform is used to raise money for President Trump\u2019s re-election, campaign committees and various Republican candidates across the country.\n\nMega mall owners mull investing in Forever 21 after bankruptcy\n\nTwo mall titans may invest in the bankrupt teen retailer Forever 21. The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday morning and recently tried to cut a deal in which its two largest landlords, Brookfield Property and Simon Property, would take an ownership stake, according to the New York Post. The reason is Forever 21 uses a lot of mall space with its 541 stores. The nationwide closure of 178 locations would leave big holes at shopping malls. Negotiations between the retailer, Brookfield, and Simon reached an impasse over the weekend and are considered dead -- for now.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTODAY'S MUST-READS\n\nSan Francisco removes boulders meant to deter homeless campers because this reason.\n\nOprah opens up about recent health scare, makes plea to fans\n\nWWE's John Cena talks effort to prevent suicides among veterans returning from combat.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nInvesting in you - Never stop trying: CEO suggests to fellow American dreamers.\n\nMark Cuban thinks the NCAA will 'implode' if this happens.\n\nWarren Buffett's Duracell sued by Energizer.\n\n#TheFlashback: CLICK HERE to find out what happened on \"This Day in History.\"\n\nSOME PARTING WORDS\n\nTucker Carlson says the left has been working tirelessly to impeach President Trump since his inauguration.
