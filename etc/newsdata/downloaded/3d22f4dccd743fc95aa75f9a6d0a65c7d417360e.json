The small animal and exotic veterinarian in Texas got her seven-year-old Schnoodle (a Schnauzer-poodle mix) named Ruby a $25 cow costume, and she and her husband are dressing up as farmers to match her. Last year they spent about $100 on her princess costume, which included jewelry and a tiara. And one of Ruby\u2019s very first costumes was as a frog, with Ochoa dressing as a princess.\n\n\u201cShe loves being able to attend Halloween parties with us,\u201d Ochoa told MarketWatch, noting that Ruby is often the center of attention. \u201cShe has been dressing up for Halloween her whole life.\u201d In fact, Ruby has enough clothes to fill her own closet.\n\nBecky Beach, a parenting blogger at MomBeach.com, spent about $30 to doll up her Pomeranian, Jivaeri, as a bumblebee this year. The little bug will go trick-or-treating with Beach and her 4-year-old son Bryan. \u201cWe get our furbaby involved because she is part of our family. I think of her as my daughter!\u201d Beach told MarketWatch. \u201cShe dresses up every year.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Becky Beach Jivaeri will be dressed as a bumblebee this year \u2014 a popular dog costume pick.\n\nAnd John Frigo, who works in digital marketing in Chicago, will be dressing his dachshund mix Beans as a hot dog, and his bulldog Bambam as \u201can old man poker player with a cigar and one of those green visor hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun for us, and trick-or-treaters seem to find it funny,\u201d he said, also describing his pups as members of the family. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of natural to involve them in the holidays.\u201d\n\nAnd it looks like Beans is on trend this year. In fact, you can expect to see packs of four-legged frankfurters among the trick-or-treaters on your block, as \u201chot dog\u201d is the second most popular pet costume after \u201cpumpkin\u201d on the NRF list. Superhero, bumblebee and cat costumes round out the top five.\n\nRover.com also surveyed hundreds of dog owners around the country, and found that half (51%) plan to dress their hounds for Halloween, spending about $20 on average. Classic seasonal specters like witches and ghosts are among the most popular costumes on Rover.com\u2019s list, along with TV and movie characters.\n\nOf course, Americans are spending more on their pets than ever before, according to the American Pet Products Association, as humans laid out a record-breaking $72.56 billion for food, supplies and over-the-counter medications, veterinary care, live animal purchases and other services last year.\n\n\u201cToday more than ever, pet owners view their pets as irreplaceable members of their families and lives,\u201d said the APPA\u2019s president and CEO Bob Vetere in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that giving pets the best lives possible is still a top priority for pet owners, and they\u2019re willing to spend more on the quality products and services they consume if it means more quality time with their beloved companions.\u201d\n\nAnd as far as Halloween spending is concerned, social media is driving some pretty spooktacular trends. Last month, Vanessa Cheng from Hong Kong posted an Instagram FB, -2.86% video of her 11-month-old French bulldog hobbling down a hall while dressed as Chucky, the killer doll from the \u201cChild\u2019s Play\u201d slasher movie franchise.\n\nIt went viral as the likes of Patton Oswalt shared it across Twitter TWTR, -2.54% and Facebook. And thus, \u201cChucky dog costume\u201d became the most-searched dog costume on Google GOOG, -0.14% in September. It\u2019s now sold out on Party City\u2019s PRTY, +1.60% website, where it was originally $22.50, but some enterprising sellers are hawking it on eBay EBAY, -0.15% for $80 for those who are willing to pay up to get their paws on one.\n\nKylie Jenner also posted some photos of her Italian greyhounds dressed as Woody, Buzz Lightyear and Little Bo-Peep from Disney\u2019s DIS, +1.97% \u201cToy Story\u201d movies in her Instagram Story last week. They run $20.26 to $32.95 on shopdisney.com, or they\u2019re also available on Chewy CHWY, +1.51% and Amazon AMZN, -0.69%.\n\nWhat Toy Story character would your pet be? https://t.co/MKt19sdf2f \u2014 People Pets (@PEOPLEPets) October 15, 2019\n\nIndeed, the National Retail Federation credits social media for near-record Halloween spending in general, as Americans are laying out $8.8 billion on the fright fest this year, including $3.2 billion on costumes for kids and adults, which is just shy of 2017 year\u2019s record $9.1 billion in total spending.\n\n\u201cSpending hasn\u2019t changed much over the past few years, but we are seeing a noticeable increase in consumers whose Halloween purchases are inspired by their friends, neighbors and even celebrities on social media,\u201d said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay in a release. Most people are drawing inspiration from Pinterest PINS, -1.68%, followed by YouTube and Instagram.\n\n\u201cI think part of it is maybe the advent of social media, where people can share cute pet pictures, which encourages others to do the same,\u201d agreed Frigo.\n\nAnd plenty of dog owners have also taken to social media to commiserate over the scratch they\u2019ve spent to get their animals in on the fun.\n\ndid i just spent 20 bucks on halloween apparel for my cats yes \u2014 Kat\ud83e\udd87 (@kat_chaa) September 6, 2019\n\nI just bought my dog a THIRD Halloween costume. What dog needs THREE costumes?? \u2014 Alexianna Marie (@alex_17johnsona) October 12, 2019", "description": "Pet parents tell MarketWatch how they\u2019re getting their furbabies into the Halloween spirit", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT789_PetHal_ZG_20191022114324.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
