REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\n\nBut the move was far more cautious than easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank over the past week, suggesting Chinese policymakers remain reluctant to join a global stimulus wave due to worries about mounting debt.\n\nStill, analysts say Beijing\u2019s restraint is being put to the test, as worsening economic data in August has raised fears that third-quarter growth could slip below 6%, breaching the lower end of the government\u2019s 2019 target.\n\nMany China watchers believe more forceful measures will be needed soon to avoid a sharper slowdown and get the economy back on an even keel.\n\nAs widely expected, China\u2019s new Loan Prime Rate (LPR) \u2014 for banks\u2019 best customers \u2014 was cut 5 basis points (bps) at Friday\u2019s monthly fixing to 4.2% [CNYLPR1Y=CFXS], the second time it has been trimmed since it was revamped in August, and days after the central bank\u2019s latest reduction in banks\u2019 reserve requirements (RRR) took effect.\n\nTotal reductions in the rate so far, at 11 bps, are less than half of the Fed\u2019s quarter-point rate cut on Thursday, which some analysts say reflects policymakers\u2019 concerns that lower rates could lead to property bubbles and add to financial risks.\n\nThe five-year benchmark rate [CNYLPR5Y=CFXS], which is likely to be used for mortgages, was left unchanged at 4.85%.\n\n\u201cSince the new rate is relatively untested, the PBOC (People\u2019s Bank of China) appears to be taking a measured approach at first,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.\n\n\u201cHowever, with economic activity likely to come under further pressure in the coming quarters and monetary easing so far failing to generate much of a pick-up in credit growth, we think the PBOC will need to start engineering larger declines before long.\u201d\n\nWhile small, the latest cut signals to markets that policymakers remain open to further easing, some analysts said.\n\nREFORMS TO BRING RATES DOWN OVER TIME\n\nChina\u2019s central bank has been struggling to bring down financing costs for years, particularly for small, private companies which generate a large share of country\u2019s economic activity and jobs. But such firms are considered bigger credit risks, and banks have long favored state-backed enterprises.\n\nIn long-awaited interest rate reforms, the PBOC designated the LPR as its benchmark for new loans last month to guide borrowing costs lower, though the previous benchmark lending rate will still apply to older loans for a while longer.\n\nThe new reference rate is set by 18 banks, and is loosely pegged to the rate on the central bank\u2019s medium-term lending facility (MLF), now at 3.3%.\n\nStill, economists believe the central bank plays a key role behind the scenes in adjusting the LPR.\n\n\u201cThe LPR is based on banks\u2019 quotations. If there is no government intervention, it\u2019s hard to believe banks are willing to lower their quotations, because corporate demand for loans is not weak at all,\u201d said Luo Yunfeng, an analyst at Merchants Securities in Beijing, noting that lower rates also mean smaller profit margins.\n\nA PROTECTION STORY?\n\nIris Pang, Greater China economist for ING in Hong Kong, said Friday\u2019s rate move \u201cis not a growth-stimulation story, I think it is more a protection story, to not fall into a weaker growth range. Growth has been very weak and this is more for lowering interest costs for production and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nA more effective way to reduce borrowing costs would be for the PBOC to directly cut MLF rates, said Tang Jianwei, analyst at Bank of Communications (BoComm), saying \u201cmore loosening is highly necessary because the economy is sluggish.\u201d\n\nThe PBOC last cut the MLF rate in early 2016, and its policy benchmark rate in 2015. But the latest RRR cuts have taken those levels to the lowest since 2007.\n\nWen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing, also said China needs to cut interest rates further, and by the same margin as the Fed.\n\n\u201cThat will help stabilize market expectations, investment, consumption and will not put pressure on the exchange rate.\u201d\n\nWang Yifeng, analyst at Everbright Securities, forecast another 5-10 bps fall in the LPR in November, as the long-running trade war takes a deeper toll.", "description": "China cut its new one-year benchmark lending rate for the second month in a row on Friday, a step by the central bank to try to wrestle down borrowing costs and support the economy as the Sino-U.S. trade war drags on.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431888726&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0FQ", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
