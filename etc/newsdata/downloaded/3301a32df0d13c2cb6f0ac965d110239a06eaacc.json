REUTERS/Gary He/File Photo\n\nAsked about potential delays from overseas regulators which also must approve the MAX\u2019s return, Muilenburg said, \u201cit could well be that approvals will vary by jurisdiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd again, the regulators will make that decision. Ultimately, it will be their timeline,\u201d he said.\n\nMuilenburg said the company was making \u201cdaily\u201d progress on testing the final software fix for the 737 MAX and developing related training materials, though the FAA said on Tuesday it would need at least several more weeks for review.\n\nThe company could consider cutting or halting 737 production if regulatory approvals are further delayed, Muilenburg said, though there was no immediate announcement of job cuts.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. manufacturer reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit and a negative free cash flow of $2.89 billion in the quarter, compared with a positive free cash flow of $4.10 billion a year earlier.\n\nCore operating earnings fell to $895 million or $1.45 per share, from $1.89 billion or $3.58 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNEW SETBACKS\n\nThe MAX crisis, which has consumed the company, has eclipsed work on a potential new mid-market airplane codenamed NMA, and other industrial setbacks broadened pressure on the company\u2019s new commercial leadership.\n\nOn Tuesday, Boeing named veteran executive Stan Deal, who had been running its two-year-old Global Services Division, to the top job at commercial airplanes.\n\nDeal\u2019s challenge is to get the MAX back into service globally while simultaneously handling new aircraft deliveries and boosting 737 production. That\u2019s seen as one of the most formidable logistical challenges in the industry\u2019s history.\n\nAfter the 737 MAX safety ban in March, Boeing cut 737 monthly production from 52 aircraft to 42 and halted deliveries, cutting off a key source of cash and hitting margins.\n\nBoeing\u2019s previous schedule to hit a record manufacturing rate of 57 single-aisle jets per month by June 2020, after incrementally returning to pre-crash levels, was now delayed until late 2020, the company said.\n\nMuilenburg also said General Electric (GE.N) was making \u201cgood progress\u201d addressing problems with its GE9X engine for the 777X twin-aisle, and the aircraft was still on track for a first flight in early 2020.\n\nBut Boeing was now targeting early 2021 for the first delivery of the 777X, and sees 3 total 777-program deliveries per month in 2020, verses 3.5 per month in 2019, Muilenburg said.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nWith the 777-8 and 777-9, Boeing aims to maintain its grip on the \u2018mini-jumbo\u2019 market by leap-frogging rival Airbus\u2019 (AIR.PA) 365-seat A350-1000 and scooping up fresh orders following the demise of the A380 superjumbo.\n\nCiting global trade tensions and a lack of orders from China, America\u2019s largest exporter was also reducing the 787 Dreamliner production rate to 12 airplanes per month for approximately two years beginning in late 2020.\n\nBoeing faced additional uncertainty over future production rates for its Dreamliner earlier this month from lost business, theoretically putting a hole in production after Boeing increased its build-rate to 14 aircraft per month from 12 at twin U.S. factories.", "description": "Boeing Co said on Wednesday it still expects U.S. regulatory approval for its grounded 737 MAX in the fourth quarter, sending its shares higher despite a slump in quarterly profit.", "authors": ["Ankit Ajmera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444102092&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M13L", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
