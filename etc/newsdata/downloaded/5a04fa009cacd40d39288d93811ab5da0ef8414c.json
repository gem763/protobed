Trump is also threatening to hit the European car industry with high tariffs over what he describes as an unfair playing field in the auto trade.\n\nAll of those transatlantic tensions are expected to land squarely on the desk of Phil Hogan, the Irish nominee for trade commissioner, who will face a parliamentary hearing on Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I haven't managed to leave that portfolio in total order for my successor,\" Malmstr\u00f6m quipped, when asked about relations with the U.S.\n\nWhile the Swede has scored big wins in her tenure with landmark deals \u2014 including breakthroughs in accords with Canada, Vietnam, Japan and the South American Mercosur bloc \u2014 she also tried to push for a \"value-based\" approach to trade that is at odds with the transactional approach of the Trump administration.\n\nUnder her mandate, the EU has included in its new trade agreements an obligation to ratify the Paris climate deal. Malmstr\u00f6m has also pushed for gender equality and is aiming to include language on women's rights in future agreements with Chile and New Zealand. \"Just by putting it on the agenda,\" the EU could nudge countries and companies to empower women, Malmstr\u00f6m said.\n\nDespite these attempts to modernize trade policy, Malmstr\u00f6m also spent much of her time striking a far more defensive position against the Americans.\n\n\"You have to be very patient,\" when dealing with Trump and his officials, Malmstr\u00f6m said, with a grin. Over the past two years, she has talked dozens of times with her counterparts Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, in a constant effort to avert a full-blown conflagration.\n\n\"We do talk regularly, we have contacts and even if we disagree. There's an ongoing conversation with Ambassador Lighthizer who I have met many times and speak to over the phone. And, you know, we talk,\" she said.\n\nThe problem is that despite these regular contacts with his closest advisers, Trump's motives remain unclear. \"Who thinks what in the administration is hard to know \u2026 it's become a bit unpredictable. It's clear that the U.S. administration likes tariffs, and they think that tariffs can be used for all kinds of things ... They have also this notion that trade is only measured by deficits or surplus, which is a bit old-fashioned, in our view,\" she added.\n\nBut the EU trade chief was willing to strike an optimistic note for Hogan\u2019s negotiations: Look past Trump, she said, and you will realize that Europe has more friends in Washington than you'd think \u2014 and that's what will spare Europe the sort of trade war the U.S. has started with China.\n\n\"The difference is that \u2014 I mean, we talk a lot about the U.S. administration, and they are of course, extremely powerful ... but in the Congress, in the Senate, and in the House, and among you know, academia, business life, there are lots and lots of people with European assent, and who are convinced that the transatlantic link is important,\" said Malmstr\u00f6m.\n\n\"So I think he has got much more political resistance when it comes to doing things against Europe than against China, where even many Democrats support these policies.\"\n\nTrump has slapped tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese exports, but only on around $10 billion of EU steel and aluminum.\n\n\"Will they start a massive trade war with us? Well, they have the aluminum and steel tariffs, that is unfortunate, but I wouldn't call that a trade war,\" Malmstr\u00f6m said.\n\nTrump has to make a decision on whether to hit the EU with additional tariffs on cars and car parts by November 13.\n\nBut again, Malmstr\u00f6m was surprisingly upbeat: \"If you look at the U.S. debate, there's not one single congressman or senator or trade unionist or big company in the U.S. who have said publicly that tariffs are a good idea on cars and car parts\" from Europe.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
