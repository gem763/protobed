China's top trade envoy, Liu He, will lead a delegation to resume trade talks with U.S. officials in Washington on Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged the U.S. to withdraw its move against the Chinese firms, and said, \"China will continue to take firm and strong measures to uphold its national sovereignty, our security and development interests.\"\n\nIn the U.S., futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.5%.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 was down 0.9% in midday trade, with losses across most regional indexes.\n\nShares in London Stock Exchange Group fell 5.9% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled a $36.6 billion bid for its London rival, a deal that would have united two major trading hubs.\n\nMeanwhile, German industrial output grew slightly in August, according to official data. The rise came as a surprise after a dismal reading on Monday of manufacturing orders for the same month.\n\nIndustrial output increased 0.3% in August over July in adjusted terms, the statistical office said. Despite the better-than-expected output, the industry remains in a downturn, the Ministry of Economics said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year German bund edged down to minus 0.578%, from minus 0.572% Monday afternoon. The yield on 10-year Treasurys also edged down to 1.550%, from 1.552% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nIn currencies, the British pound fell 0.6% against the U.S. dollar on increasing doubts that the U.K. can reach a deal with the European Union before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nOn the trade front, China's recent large purchases from the U.S. soybean market have signaled a potential thaw in relations. But China has also sought to narrow the scope of the trade negotiations, putting aside national-security issues and adding to market concerns that an immediate resolution is unlikely.\n\n\"They will not reach an agreement at any price,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at London Capital Group. \"Despite the optimism we see, there's a chance this week ends with another disappointment.\"\n\nGlobal oil benchmark Brent crude fell 0.4% to $58.10 a barrel, and gold gained 0.2%.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 1% and Korea's Kospi gained 1.2%. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose 0.3% as Chinese markets returned from a holiday.\n\nSamsung Electronics' shares rose 2.4% after the company delivered a strong third-quarter earnings forecast.\n\nEva Dou contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 07:19 ET (11:19 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
