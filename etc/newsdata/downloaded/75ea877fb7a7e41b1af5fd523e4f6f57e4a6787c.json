Bayley halted her momentum, hanging her up on the top rope, but Lynch expertly tagged Flair into the match.\n\nThe action broke down, with all four women hammering away on each other. Banks and Bayley looked to regroup on the floor, but Flair launched herself off the top rope with a moonsault that wiped out both opponents. She rolled Bayley into the ring, applied the Figure Eight and tapped out Bayley for the big tag team victory.\n\nResult\n\nFlair and Lynch defeated Bayley and Banks.\n\nGrade\n\nB\n\nAnalysis\n\nThis was a greatest hits version of the longer, frankly better, match we saw a few weeks back between these same teams.\n\nThe purpose, beyond showcasing the division, was to put over Flair against Bayley and set her up for championship opportunity. Corey Graves alluded to as much seconds after the tap out. With only a handful of matches announced for Sunday's Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, do not be surprised if that title bout ends up part of the lineup based on the conclusion of this one.\n\nIt is somewhat curious that Banks was de-emphasized as much as she was given her championship match inside the Hell in a Cell structure against Lynch on Sunday night, but protecting her from the loss was a wise move on the part of WWE Creative.", "description": "A new era in WWE history kicked off Friday night in Los Angeles with the premiere of Friday Night SmackDown on Fox, headlined by a colossal main event featuring Kofi Kingston defending his WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar...", "authors": ["Erik Beaston"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/831/523/0b701d399a710f8fd766e4939939bed1_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
