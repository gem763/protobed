That is not the same as wanting him impeached, much less convicted by the Senate and removed from office, but it represents a momentum the president needs to address and soon.\n\nThe president is correct that he is being treated \u201cunfairly\u201d and has been since before the election, which the left still resents his having won. Still, would the president be in such deep water if he displayed a different personality, or at least was kinder to his political opponents?\n\nLast week at a rally in Minnesota, the president said Barack Obama chose Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008, because \u201cBiden understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d That gets his mostly white rally-goers energized, but what effect does it have on the rest of the country?\n\nEllen DeGeneres recently demonstrated a different model for relating to political opposites. She was seen at a football game sitting in a box and smiling with former president George W. Bush, whose father was criticized by some on the right for speaking of the need for a \u201ckinder and gentler\u201d nation. Ms. DeGeneres said people should be more kind to each other, even if they have different political beliefs.\n\nThe New York Post noted, \u201cDeGeneres, 61, has banned numerous celebrities from appearing on her show when they have expressed views that contradict her own, including those who have vocalized their anti-gay marriage views.\u201d Ms. DeGeneres is gay and married to a woman.\n\nInconsistency is not unique to Ms. DeGeneres, but she has a point worth considering.\n\nIn their biography of the late Jack Kemp, the former congressman, 1996 vice presidential candidate and later HUD secretary, Fred Barnes and Morton Kondracke write: \u201cKemp embodied a spirit sorely missing in today\u2019s politics \u2014 in both parties. Kemp was positive, optimistic, idealistic, energetic, growth-and opportunity-oriented. He was incapable of personal attack and negative campaigning, even when it cost him. \u2018The purpose of politics,\u2019 he said, \u2018is not to defeat your opponent as much as it is to provide superior leadership and better ideas than the opposition.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of my favorite Kemp lines was that you don\u2019t beat a thesis with an anti-thesis; you beat it with a better thesis.\n\nPresident Trump has a better thesis. Like Mr. Kemp\u2019s promotion of supply-side economics in the 1970s, which Ronald Reagan came to embrace, leading to an economic boom, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are working. He should spend less time calling his opponents names and more time dissecting policies that have failed the country in the past.\n\nDemocrats have nothing to offer but \u201cfree\u201d stuff and impeachment. They are trying to make the president\u2019s personality central to what some have called a \u201ccoup.\u201d He is helping them. It is one thing to be combative, but quite another to be mean.\n\nThe president is pushing back against his critics in ways no other recent Republican president has done and good for him for doing so. But there is a way to do it that wins votes and prevails in the next election and another way that detracts from the president\u2019s multiple achievements and could lead to political disaster.\n\nThe Old Testament prophet, Jeremiah, rhetorically asks, \u201cCan a leopard change his spots?\u201d At his age President Trump may not be able to change his \u201cspots,\u201d but he can tone down the invective against opponents, which is only giving them and everyone else who hates him permission to fire back in a similar manner.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
