Financial Sector Earnings Next Week Could Help Tell Us", "language": "en", "text": "During Q2 earnings season, Financial sector results helped renew investor confidence in the U.S. consumer.\n\nThe question heading into Q3 is whether banking executives still see the same kind of strength, and if they think it can continue amid trade wars, Brexit, and signs of weakness in the U.S. economy.\n\nOver the last three months, as the broader stock market rallied to an all-time high, slammed the brakes, and then re-tested earlier peaks, consumer health arguably did much of the heavy lifting. It felt like every time stocks pulled back, they got a second wind from retail sales, housing or some other data or earnings news that showed consumers still out there buying.\n\nThe banks played a huge role in setting the stage by reporting better-than-expected Q2 results that showed signs of strong consumer demand even as some of the banks\u2019 trading divisions took a hit. Next week, six of the biggest banks come back to talk about their Q3 experience and what they expect for Q4. Analysts expect Financial sector earnings to drop slightly in Q3.\n\nThat said, most of the major banking names have done an excellent job keeping costs in check as they wrestle with fundamental industry headwinds like falling interest rates and slowing revenue from their trading divisions. This time out, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see more of the same, and you can\u2019t rule out a bit more vigor from the trading business thanks to all the volatility we saw in the markets last quarter.\n\nEarnings growth may not be there for Financials this time around, or it could be negligible. At the end of the day, though, Financial companies are still likely to be remarkably profitable considering a yield curve that remains relatively flat and global macroeconomic concerns, according to Briefing.com. This sector knows how to make money, but it might just not make as much as it did a year ago. Earnings will likely show large banking companies still in good financial condition with the U.S. consumer generally in decent shape for now, as the U.S. economy arguably remains the best-kept house on a tough block.\n\nInvestors have started to pick up on all this, judging from the S&P 500 Financial sector\u2019s good health over the last month and year to date. The sector is up 3.4% from a month ago to easily lead all sectors over that time period, and up 15% since the start of 2019. The 15% gain is below the SPX\u2019s 17% year-to-date pace, but it\u2019s an improvement after a few years when Financials generally didn\u2019t participate as much in major market rallies.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 1: ON PACE. After some challenging and confusing years for those investing in the Financial sector, this year has been a relief. The Financials (IXM-candlestick) are only trailing the S&P 500 Index (SPX-purple line) slightly since the start of 2019, and have led all sectors in performance over the last month.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.\n\nWhat to Listen For\n\nNo one necessarily planned it, but it\u2019s helpful in a way that banks report early in the earnings season. Few other industries have larger megaphones or the ability to set the tone like the biggest financial institutions can. The other sectors are important, too, but they often see things from their own silos. Combined, the big banks have a view of the entire economy and all the industries, as well as what consumers and investors are doing. Their positive remarks last quarter didn\u2019t really give Financial stocks an immediate lift, but it did apparently help reassure investors who were nervous about everything from trade wars to Brexit.", "description": "During Q2 earnings season, Financial sector results helped renew investor confidence in the U.S. consumer.
