And I think we have understood it subsequent to the event.\n\n\"It was a shame because Singapore is a circuit - we still managed to get a podium out of it and beat both Mercedes - but you could not help but feel that we had not maximised our potential.\"\n\nExplaining Red Bull's form from More\n\n\"Russia was about on par with where our expectation was and I think what has happened since is that we have seen Ferrari take a step forward as well.\n\n\"But hopefully for the remaining races we should be able to get back into a competitive situation - and we have seen we are a lot closer than 12 months ago.\"\n\nRed Bull had viewed this season - its first with the Honda powertrain - as a transition year to greater success in 2020, and Horner feels the team is in a good place as it focuses on making the next step.\n\n\"I think what Honda have done in improving each of the engines that have been introduced [is positive], and I think chassis wise for sure we took a bigger hit on the front wing regs than perhaps some of our competitors,\" Horner continued.\n\n\"Having understood that and worked our way through that, it very much feels like we are building good momentum in the latter stage of development of this car into 2020.\"\n\nAsked if he felt the ingredients were there for the team to deliver next year, he said: \"I think collectively there are a lot of good things going on and this year has been very much a transitionary year.\n\n\"I think working with the engineers at Sakura and Milton Keynes, they have really gelled extremely well, and I think we will start to see the benefits of that hopefully during the course of next year.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Red Bull has faith that it is building 'momentum' for a better Formula 1 season in 2020, despite post-summer break progress being clouded by an 'oddball' Singapore Grand Prix performance", "authors": ["Jonathan Noble"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m4DJaFJB.ceAW32AV_vuIg--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/d14e3ba3352270047afd81383a5661dc", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
