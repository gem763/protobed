The timeslot, which begins at 3 p.m. EDT, will be filled by rotating news anchors in a new show called Fox News Reporting.\n\nSmith has a non-compete agreement with Fox News, meaning he won\u2019t be switching to another cable network in the near future. He said he plans to spend more time with his family.\n\n\u201cShep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry,\u201d Fox News executive editor and President Jay Wallace said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHis integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put Fox News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery.\u201d\n\nSmith, who joined Fox News in 1996, was among the voices more critical of the Trump administration at the network, fact checking the president and often debunking conservative talking points. In the past, he feuded with Fox News\u2019 opinion contributors, including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.\n\n\u201cEven in our current polarized nation, it is my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive,\u201d he said Friday.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Watch the latest video at foxnews.com Watch the latest video at foxnews.com News anchor Shep Smith announced Friday he\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
