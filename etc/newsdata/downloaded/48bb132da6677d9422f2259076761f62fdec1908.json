Objects containing liquid believed to be urine were hurled at some of my officers along with bottles and rocks. Police horses were also assaulted by protesters striking them with sticks,\" he continued.\n\nArradondo explained because members of Antifa and other protesters were becoming \"violent and aggressive\" and \"causing harm to others in attendance,\" pepper spray was used against them.\n\nMore video from outside Trump rally in Minneapolis. We saw protestors throw stuff at police & their horses. Endless vulgarities. Intimidate Trump supporters & media. Surround cars so they couldn\u2019t leave. Light fires. pic.twitter.com/xHffkSAPpx \u2014 Matt Finn (@MattFinnFNC) October 11, 2019\n\nThe website that called for Antifa to come out to the \"AMERICA IS CANCELED\" counter-protest, published a report from someone that was present. In the post, they boasted how they set off fireworks and spray painted storefront windows \"with slogans not just against the bogeyman of Trump or fascism but against the police most of all.\"\n\n\"On October 10th, the police lost control. And in that void, we could glimpse beautiful expressions of joy and revolt,\" they added.\n\nMore videos from outside of Trump's rally on Thursday show counter-protesters harassing Trump supporters, with one woman slapped in the face by a counter-protester.\n\nAfter the @realDonaldTrump rally in Minneapolis, his supporters were attacked by left-wing extremists.
