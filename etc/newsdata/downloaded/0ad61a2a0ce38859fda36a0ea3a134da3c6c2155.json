In attempting to see over the economic horizon, they appeared more to be seeking to see past this administration. The economy remains sound, even as attempts to discredit become less so.\n\nOn August 19, the Washington Post\u2019s first sentence summed up its one-dimensional angle on the National Association for Business Economics\u2019 August survey: \u201cMost economists believe the United States will tip into recession by 2021, a new survey shows, despite White House insistence the economy is sound.\u201d So it went, with most establishment news outlets bent on finding the gray cloud around today\u2019s current sterling economy.\n\nNegative news sells. Perhaps it has always been thus, though it certainly seems most prevalent when the news is adverse to this administration.\n\nInterestingly, the latest NABE survey showed something else \u2014 an improvement over the previous survey \u2014 if the time had been taken to read it. As the survey stated in its section on the economy, \u201cCompared with results in the February 2019 survey, respondents, on balance, expect the next U.S. recession to occur later.\u201d In other words, the survey shows an improved outlook regarding recession.\n\nRespondents predicting a recession this year dropped from 10 percent to 2 percent. Those anticipating one next year also dropped, from 42 percent to 38 percent. Presuming these more optimistic respondents must put their predictions somewhere, they moved them to 2021, causing this later estimation to rise from 25 percent to 34 percent. Finally, those predicting the next recession would be even later moved up from 11 percent to 14 percent.\n\nDespite three of the four groups reporting a better recession picture, the headlines managed to deliver worse news on the economy. All this, despite the evidence before America\u2019s eyes being one of a very strong economy \u2014 one notably stronger than that of the preceding administration.\n\nEven disregarding the slant in coverage, the question why so much would be attributed to such a projection is intriguing. Consider a notable past one from 2007.\n\nRegarding NABE\u2019s 2007 survey, a September Reuters story that year stated, \u201cProjected 2008 growth was cut to 2.8 percent from 3.1 percent, with reductions concentrated in the first half.\u2026 Still, many thought that recession, while a risk, could most likely be avoided.\u2026 Only a third of respondents guessed that \u2018domino effects\u2019 were under way where losses in the subprime mortgage market would spread to many other sectors.\u201d Really?\n\nWell, 2008 growth actually turned out to be shrinkage \u2014 contracting by 0.1 percent. The \u201creductions\u201d actually fell more in the second half; while Q1 shrank 2.3 percent, Q3 fell 2.1, and Q4, 8.4 percent. All told, beginning in 2008, the economy contracted in five of the next six quarters, and 2009 annual GDP fell 2.5 percent.\n\nRecession turned out to be more than just a \u201crisk\u201d and was hardly \u201cavoided,\u201d instead being dubbed the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression. As for those \u201cdomino effects\u201d that only one third predicted, well, let us just say they did happen \u2014 in spades.\n\nOf course, once these predictions proved widely wrong, no one remembered. Instead, there was a mass absolution that \u201cno one saw it coming.\u201d That of course was partly true, but at the same time, it is also the entire point.\n\nThe purpose is not to focus on a lack of perfection in prognostication, but on an inability to see through the front windshield. If you could miss the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression when it\u2019s just months away, why are we being so subservient to these predictions now? This is especially so when they are used to base a headline on a prediction two years away.\n\nThe truth is that the economists\u2019 flaw is the same for \u201cexperts\u201d everywhere: They are especially adept at identifying objects receding in the rearview mirror, which they have just run over \u2014 or that have just run over them \u2014 but particularly inept at seeing them approaching.\n\nAll revolutions and revelations start by proving \u201cexperts\u201d wrong. Truthfully, that is their implicit identifier. The revolution and revelation then become routine, and new \u201cexperts\u201d sprout up around them. And so they remain until the process regenerates itself again.\n\n\u201cExperts\u201d are by definition masters of conventional wisdom. \u201cAdvances,\u201d which are by definition breaks from conventional wisdom, are therefore missed by \u201cexperts.\u201d\n\nThe recent NABE survey is just the latest reminder that it is dubious to overlook the obvious in search of the nebulous. Unless, of course, what you are looking for is a headline in search of a story.", "description": "Recent breathless headlines of impending recession exposed the \u201cexperts\u201d more than the economy.
