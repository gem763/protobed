Their friendship became even more strained when the two started dissing each other and when Drake was seen with Kanye\u2019s ex Amber Rose.\n\nBut it seems like Kanye is ready to put all that behind him by trying to get Drake\u2019s attention in the strangest way. Speaking during an interview with Zane Lowe, the Jesus Is King rapper revealed how he tries to make peace with Drake by leaving him notes at his house, which is in the same neighbourhood as Kanye\u2019s home.\n\n\"You cannot be in service to God and be mad at your brother next door,\" Yeezy first said.\n\n\"I go to Drake\u2019s house. I walk over there with no security and just will leave my phone number. Here\u2019s my cell. I\u2019m not trying to ring the doorbell and say, 'You gotta come outside right now.' He might be busy. He got a studio in there,\" he continued.\n\nAnd speaking on his controversial relationship with Jay Z, Yeezy said there were levels to rap icons.\n\n\"With Jay, I love all of these people, but you got to know there\u2019s a lineage of Jay to Ye to Drake,\" West continued.\n\n\"This person is your idol. Then you get to know 'em, then you be friends, then you turn to frenemies, then you turn to enemies, and then you gotta bring back the positive energy. But that is the lineage of rap kings and inspirers.\"", "description": "Ever since becoming a born-again Christian, rapper Kanye West is making a lot of changes in his life.", "authors": ["Mahlohonolo Magadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9529/9064447d212c4f838e9e5f296462e118.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
