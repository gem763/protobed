The Kurds will have nothing to do with America. They have now made a deal with the Assad government. The whole thing makes no sense.\"\n\nMarwan Kabalan from the Arab Center for Research told Al Jazeera the latest move to re-deploy forces to Syria reflects the contradictions in US foreign policy.\n\n\"US policy on Syria has been so inconsistent, it's very difficult to predict whether the United States will stay or leave,\" Kabalan said.\n\n\"The conflict is in Washington between President Trump and the foreign policy establishment, particularly the Pentagon. His eyes have always been on the upcoming election, he wants to boost support from his political base.\"\n\n'Shocking ignorance'\n\nBrett McGurk, the top US official leading Trump's anti-ISIL campaign until January, also criticised the latest shift in a social media post.\n\n\"The president of the United States of America appears to be calling for a mass migration of Kurds to the desert where they can resettle atop a tiny oilfield. Shocking ignorance of history, geography, law, American values, human decency, and honour.\"\n\nTrump had justified his earlier decision to withdraw US forces from Syria, saying he sought to bring about 1,000 troops home and end American involvement there.\n\nTrump said previously a \"small number\" of US troops would remain in Syria to secure the oilfields. An American official told the Washington Post earlier this week a proposal calls for 200 US troops to remain in the area.\n\nNews reports from Newsweek and US broadcaster Fox said a new deployment may include dozens of tanks and hundreds of soldiers.\n\n\n\nThe Turkish assault on northeastern Syria and the US-allied Kurdish forces has been halted after the US brokered a ceasefire.\n\nAnkara also brokered a deal with Russia that saw the evacuation of Kurdish forces from a vast area along Syria's border with Turkey.\n\nHow about the oil?\n\nThe Kurdish forces seized control of small oil fields in northeastern Hassakeh province after Syrian government troops pulled out of most of the Kurdish-majority regions in 2012 to fight rebels elsewhere.\n\nAfter expelling ISIL from southeastern Syria in 2018, the Kurds seized control of the more profitable oil fields in Deir Az Zor province.\n\nA quiet arrangement has existed between the Kurds and the Syrian government, whereby Damascus buys the surplus through middlemen in a profitable smuggling operation that has continued despite political differences. The Kurdish-led administration sells crude oil to private refiners, who use primitive homemade refineries to process fuel and diesel and sell it back to the administration.\n\nThe SDF currently sells Syria's oil for about $30 per barrel.\n\nThe oil was expected to be a bargaining chip for the Kurds to negotiate a deal with the Syrian government, which unsuccessfully tried to reach the oil fields to retake them from ISIL. With Trump saying he plans to keep forces to secure the oil, it seems the oil will continue to be used for leverage - with Moscow and Damascus.\n\nMcGurk said on Monday: \"Oil, like it or not, is owned by the Syrian state. Maybe there are new lawyers, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets.\"\n\nBefore the war, Syria produced about 350,000 barrels per day, exporting more than half of it. Most of that oil came from eastern Syria. Foreign companies, including Total, Shell, and Conoco, all left Syria after the war began more than eight years ago.\n\nUS Senator Lindsey Graham said after meeting with Trump on Thursday that he urged him to stay engaged in Syria.\n\n\"If you can find a way to secure the oil fields from Iran and ISIS, that's in our national security interest,\" Graham said.", "description": "Analysts question latest Trump policy shift that reportedly includes deployment of more troops alongside Kurdish forces.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/20f8cfd125534d4fb1dad8df619c1e81_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
