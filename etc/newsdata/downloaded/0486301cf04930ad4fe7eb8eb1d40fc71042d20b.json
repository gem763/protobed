We\u2019ll be bringing you stories of innovators, entrepreneurs, prognosticators, heretics, artists, thinkers, and everyday people whose ideas were initially ignored or dismissed as crazy but ultimately found acceptance. We\u2019ll also examine what it takes to survive as an intellectual and creative outcast in a world that\u2019s not quite ready for what you\u2019re selling.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at Vindication with a capital V, so often afforded after death, as it was in the case of 19th-century Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who ended up straightjacketed in an insane asylum, beaten to death by guards, his theory on hygiene \u2014 that doctors should wash their hands before surgery \u2014 having been roundly rejected and ridiculed by the medical community. Or Edmond Halley, who didn\u2019t get to live to see his comet return to Earth in 1758, as he predicted it would, in an epic confirmation of Newtonian physics.\n\nBut we\u2019ll also explore variations on the theme in lower case, like that triumphant feeling you get from proving to your husband once and for all that his long-cut route to the grocery store is exactly 4.36 minutes slower than yours \u2014 and all the attendant consequences. We hope to find out what it\u2019s like to be proven innocent, to have everyone think you\u2019re crazy when you\u2019re not, and to get up close to the thin line between delusion and conviction. (By the way, Hemingway wasn\u2019t paranoid \u2014 the FBI really was stalking him.) We\u2019ll have fun with rejection letters, mea culpas, and scientific studies, and lament the indignity of the posthumous Pulitzer. And in the end, we\u2019ll try to leave some deserving subjects feeling a bit more vindicated than when we started. \u2014 the editor", "description": "A monthlong examination of inventors, creators, and innovators whose seemingly wild ideas eventually turned out to be brilliant.", "authors": ["Adam Laukhuf"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vindicated/2016/10/28/28-vindicated.w1200.h630.jpg"}
