The picture, in fact, is from Bigg Boss season 9 and shows contestants Suyyash Rai and Kishwar Merchant, who entered as a couple and are now married.\n\nMeanwhile, the original Saki Saki girl, Koena Mitra in one of the earlier episodes of Bigg Boss 13 opened up about her \u201cpossessive\u201d Turkish boyfriend who once threatened to burn her passport. According to reports, she was talking about Mete Meral, who was a pilot, it is said.\n\nIn the episode, she tells the housemates that she was dating a Turkish man about seven years ago and the relationship ended with bitterness. \u201cHe was from Turkey. Initially, everything was going good but slowly things started changing and he became possessive about me. The extent was reached when he once locked me in the bathroom of my house so that I could not go to work. He once told me that when you come to Turkey, I will burn your passport so that you will not be able to go back.\"\n\nKoena Mitra and Mett Merral had reportedly broken up in 2007 after dating for about a year or two.", "description": "The show known only for its controversies has begun.
