Josh Simon said. Police said he also confessed to killing three other people at his apartment in Roseville, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) south of Mount Shasta.\n\nHangud is facing four murder charges, Simon said. He is in custody in Placer County.\n\nOfficers found the bodies of an adult and two juveniles Monday at Hangud\u2019s Roseville apartment after Mount Shasta police told them of Hangud\u2019s statement, Simon said.\n\nHangud left his home in Roseville with the relative found in his car last week, and they traveled to numerous places in Northern California and ended up in Mount Shasta, Simon said.\n\nIt appeared the victims were killed over a few days, though detectives were still trying to piece together when they died, Simon said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working to put that timeline together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can confirm the victim he had in his vehicle in Mount Shasta was an adult male of East Indian descent.\u201d\n\nSimon asked the public to reach out to the Roseville Police Department if they recently saw Hangud\u2019s red Mazda 6 sedan or if they know the family.\n\nOfficials were working to identify the victims. An autopsy will determine how they died, Simon said. He declined to say if the juveniles were children or teenagers or give any details on how they died.\n\nDetectives have interviewed Hangud, but they have not determined a motive, he said.\n\nTax records showed that Hangud faced an IRS tax lien of $178,00. Hangud\u2019s only prior interaction with law enforcement in Placer County was for speeding in 2016, the Sacramento Bee reported.\n\nHangud\u2019s LinkedIn profile shows he is a data specialist and had worked for several companies in Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A man who showed up at a Northern California police station with a dead body in his car and confessed to killing that person and another three family members found inside his apartment has been identified, police said Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/family_slain_19360_c0-1038-1998-2203_s1200x700.jpg?7bff83fe4454742c63029886c17649732012e92d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
