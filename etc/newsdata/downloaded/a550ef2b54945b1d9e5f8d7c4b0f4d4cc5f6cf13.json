Drug-related deforestation is also driving people out of the region, and making climate change worse.\n\nTo move cocaine to its North American consumers, South American drug traffickers cut through Central America. To avoid law enforcement, the traffickers are using increasingly remote routes, including protected national forests. To launder their money, they invest in ranching and agriculture, two businesses notorious for bulldozing and burning forests to make way for livestock and crops. These findings are from three new reports presented in discussions hosted by the government of Costa Rica about how countries can help preserve the environment.\n\ntraffickers are using increasingly remote routes\n\nLosing forests in Central America doesn\u2019t just destabilize the region, it comes with worldwide consequences. Forests help capture and store planet-heating carbon dioxide; when they are destroyed by traffickers or by the businesses the traffickers launder their money through, they release that planet-heating gas into the atmosphere. Right now, more than 20 percent of global carbon emissions are from deforestation alone. American money is part of what\u2019s causing the problem, says Bernardo Aguilar-Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the conservation NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Neotr\u00f3pica and an author on two of the reports. He hopes the research changes the way the world approaches drug policy.\n\n\u201cYou cannot do drug control policy and conservation policy separately,\u201d Aguilar-Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cYou have to do them in harmony.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the findings are being shared today during international talks on climate change. While researchers have made the link between narcotics and deforestation in the past, researchers say this is one of the first times that cocaine\u2019s specific role in climate change has been articulated. The studies focus on areas in Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala that make up the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, which faces some of the highest rates of deforestation in the world.\n\nWhen traffickers tear through forests, they uproot communities\n\nWhen traffickers tear through forests, they also uproot communities that make their homes there. Experts say the new routes traffickers are taking don\u2019t just send cocaine north, they push people to migrate, too. Traffickers use intimidation and violence to take control of an area, and they often target communities where poverty and political instability make it more difficult for them to fight back against encroachers on their land.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve asked community leaders and protected area managers in Central America how drug trafficking impacts their work, they say, \u2018Simple, it costs lives,\u2019\u201d says Jennifer Devine, a co-author of two of the studies and an assistant professor at Texas State University. That violence, along with the loss of livelihood for people who depend on local natural resources, becomes one of the drivers for migration, she points out.\n\nProtecting the local people protects the local forest\n\nTo better curb drug trafficking and save forests, the researchers say, governments should protect the people who call these areas home. Forests managed by indigenous tribes and other local communities were less susceptible to land grabs than government-managed state parks, according to a report released today led by researchers at Oregon State University. Protecting the local people protects the local forest \u2014 and in turn, protects the entire planet.", "description": "The cocaine trade, and efforts to stop it, are causing $214.6 million in damage every year, new research released today shows.
