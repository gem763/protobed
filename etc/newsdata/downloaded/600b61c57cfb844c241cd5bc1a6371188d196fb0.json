This time the indices are not holding up as well, but the selling on some names is becoming so pronounced now that there are traders trying to catch the falling knives.\n\nThe Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) , which is a momentum stock proxy, is down another 3% Tuesday morning after losing 3% Monday. A fall of 6% is equivalent to about 1,600 DJIA points. If the Dow was down that much we would have screaming headlines in the media and a \"Markets in Turmoil\" TV special on the schedule.\n\nWhile there are some signs of stabilization as traders try to catch some oversold bounce, these buyers are most likely to be flippers and they will exit fast and kill the bounce tries.\n\nThe risk of further downside is very high here as traders trapped in some of these momentum collapses look for exits. Downtrends are mostly a function of failed bounces and lower lows and that is what developed very quickly the last two days.\n\nMy game plan is to be very slow with new buying. There are some small-caps I like but many are bidless right now and can easily fall further. My initial buys will be quite small. A few of the names I'm watching are Personalis (PSNL) , Recro Pharma (REPH) and Snap (SNAP) .\n\nWe have the first decent bounce of the day as I write but traders will be watching closely to see if the early lows hold.\n\nAnother wave of selling will hit hard if lows are tested again.", "description": "Risk of Further Market Downside Is Very High Here...FFTY", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Risk Of Further Market Downside Is Very High Here", "These Buyers Are Most Likely To Be Flippers", "They Will Exit Fast", "Kill The Bounce Tries.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Dave Butler", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/362e2e5c-3e4d-11e8-9d2a-15be0c3c2a27.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
