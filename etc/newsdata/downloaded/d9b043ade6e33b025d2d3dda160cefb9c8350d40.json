that the Rugby Football Union has been fined a four-figure fee for the stunt, although it is not thought to be as much as the \u00a32,500 that France were sanctioned for their response ahead of the 2011 Rugby World Cup final.\n\nBut World Rugby have been accused of hypocrisy with the decision after putting video footage of the incident out on their social media and YouTube channels with the caption \u201c\"England's incredible response to intense New Zealand haka\u201d, which has already been viewed more than 4m times.\n\nThe players revealed after Saturday\u2019s historic victory that Eddie Jones signed off on the move to confront the haka, but Farrell did admit that the team still planned to keep their distance in a show of respect to the All Blacks, even if their aim was to show they would not be daunted by the challenge.\n\n\"We didn't just want to stand in a flat line and let them come at us,\" said Farrell, who also smiled and winked at the opposition during the haka.\n\nAll Blacks captain Kieran Read added that he felt England\u2019s response had no impact on the match whatsoever, while England\u2019s Manu Tuilagi said: \"Everyone wanted to show that we were ready and together. It was something different that I think Eddie suggested.\"\n\nJones\u2019s opposite number Erasmus defended England over the move to respond to New Zealand\u2019s challenge, and believes that\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not 100 per cent sure what to make of that,\u201d said the South African coach, \u201cbut it was certainly interesting and it was exciting. It was certainly something new, and it brought some spice to the test match.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was disrespectful, and it was something new for everyone in world rugby. I wouldn\u2019t make a big issue about it, but it\u2019s not for me to decide.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0have been hit with a \u00a32,000 fine for their response to the haka ahead of the Rugby World Cup final, having been punished by World Rugby for crossing the halfway line before last Saturday\u2019s semi-final victory over New Zealand.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/17/owen-farrell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
