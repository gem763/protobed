I had to quit my job as I felt I couldn't work.\n\n\"I have to live with the paranoia and mistrust of men. It's a lonely trip.\"\n\nRepresenting Robakowski, Rupert Taylor said he doesn't accept he was the perpetrator and is a man of no relevant previous convictions.\n\nSentencing Robakoawki, Judge Simon Carr said: \"The attack was persistent and she fought back the best she could. She got away and you attacked her again.\n\n\"The one single thing that stopped the attack was that your keys and phone fell out of your pocket. You returned to the hotel room occupied by your partner as if nothing happened.\n\n\"The effect on the victim has been devastating and stranger attacks of this sort are exceptionally rare. Those who carry them out are exceptionally dangerous.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"You continue to deny and minimise the offence you committed and present a high-risk of sexual violence to women and will for the rest of your life.\"\n\nJudge Carr then passed an extended sentence of 14 years, meaning Robakowski must serve a minimum of nine years in custody but then will only be released when a parole board deems him to no longer be a danger.", "description": "Adam Robakowski, 31, tried to find a sex worker but failed, so he sexually attacked a stranger in Newquay, Cornwall", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "John Bett", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20579102.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_141019Slug_10907JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
