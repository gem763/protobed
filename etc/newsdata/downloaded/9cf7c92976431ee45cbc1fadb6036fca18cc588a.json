(Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)\n\nWeek 2 of the 2019 NFL season begins Thursday with an NFC South divisional matchup between a pair of 0-1 teams: The Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Follow along here for live updates.\n\nGame scheduled to resume: Play is scheduled to resume at 9:05 p.m. Eastern time. Buccaneers rookie linebacker Devin White, the fifth overall selection in the NFL draft, was seen jogging to the locker room for the weather delay. He\u2019d left the field before the game was halted, and was taken to the medical tent on the sideline. (Bucs 0, Panthers 0 with 8:31 remaining in the first quarter)\n\nPlay suspended: The game has been suspended because of storms in the Charlotte area. The teams have left the field. (Bucs 0, Panthers 0 with 8:31 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nGamble by \u2018Riverboat Ron\u2019 fails: A fourth-down gamble by Panthers Coach Ron Rivera early in the game failed. Rivera left his offense on the field on fourth and 1 from the Tampa 47-yard line, but Cam Newton was stopped short of the first down on a quarterback keeper. Remember, Newton suffered an ankle injury during the preseason. He had only three carries for minus-two yards in the regular season opener. And he didn\u2019t seem to run with his usual forcefulness on that play. Rivera doubled down on his gamble with an instant replay challenge of the spot of the ball that failed. (Bucs 0, Panthers 0 with 8:31 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nBuccaneers at Panthers\n\nWhen: Thursday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte\n\nTV: NFL Network\n\nStreaming: NFL.com, Yahoo Sports, fuboTV\n\nPregame reading\n\nWhen the season began, there were injury-related questions about Cam Newton\u2019s shoulder and his ankle. The quarterback for the Carolina Panthers and former league MVP underwent arthroscopic surgery on his throwing shoulder in January, less than two years after he underwent surgery on the same right shoulder for a partially torn rotator cuff. Newton hurt his ankle during the preseason.\n\nHe was in Carolina\u2019s season-opening lineup Sunday. But his performance did little to put any concerns about the soundness of his shoulder and ankle to rest. Newton didn\u2019t have a completion longer than 17 yards in the Panthers\u2019 30-27 loss at home to the Los Angeles Rams. As a runner, he had three carries for minus-two yards.\n\nSo there will be plenty of scrutiny on Newton as he tries to get the Panthers into the win column for the season Thursday night against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Charlotte.\n\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d Newton said when he met with reporters this week. \u201cI\u2019m ready for Thursday.\u201d\n\n[NFL power rankings, Week 2: Antonio Brown will make the Patriots next to unbeatable or ruin them]\n\nMuch was said about Newton\u2019s shoulder during the Panthers\u2019 unraveling in the second half of last season. His ability to throw the ball down the field was questioned. Those questions continued this week, and Newton acknowledged during his news conference that he has found it bothersome.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only asking me because of my shoulder,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about this? You talk to the defensive coordinator for Tampa and don\u2019t think I can throw the ball over 20 yards. And see how far that gets you. How about that?\u201d\n\nNewton joked that Panthers offensive coordinator Norv Turner must have chosen tailback Christian McCaffrey, who ran for 128 yards on 19 carries and added 10 catches for 81 yards against the Rams, and not Newton for his fantasy football team.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve went over and seen who he was drafting in his league,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why we ain\u2019t doing no deep passes, right? Because he didn\u2019t pick me for his quarterback? Now it\u2019s all making sense. Golly.\u201d\n\nNo one around the team will be laughing much if the Panthers lose again Thursday night. They went 1-7 in the second half of last season to miss the playoffs after a 6-2 start. They need Newton to begin resembling the player he was earlier in his career.\n\n\u201cI just want to win,\u201d Newton said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I just want to win in the worst way, straight up. I don\u2019t care if I throw a ball at all.\u201d\n\nThis is a divisional matchup of 0-1 teams trying to keep pace with the New Orleans Saints in the NFC South. It marks the first appearance for Panthers defensive tackle Gerald McCoy against his former team after the Buccaneers released him in May following nine seasons and six Pro Bowl appearances.\n\nIt\u2019s also a quarterbacking matchup of former Heisman Trophy winners and top overall selections in the NFL draft. It will be the second game for the Buccaneers\u2019 Jameis Winston under the team\u2019s new head coach, Bruce Arians. Hopes that Arians would get improved results out of Winston were dented when Winston threw three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns, in Sunday\u2019s 31-17 defeat at home to the San Francisco 49ers to open the season.\n\nThe loser of this game emerges with a record of 0-2 and even bigger worries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to be better,\u201d Newton said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming around. It\u2019s early. . We\u2019ve just got to get that edge back. It starts offensively.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nSean Payton is moving the Saints past the NFC Championship no-call, but he hasn\u2019t forgotten\n\nThe NFL wanted a celebration for its 100th season.
