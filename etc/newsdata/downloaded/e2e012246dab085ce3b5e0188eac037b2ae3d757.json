One officer was slashed in the neck with a knife.\n\nPolice have responded with tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds, wounding several protesters, many of whom received treatment from volunteer medical workers at the roadside.\n\nProtesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to China in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nChina denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of inciting the unrest.\n\nSaturday's \"resisting tyranny\" protest is due to begin at 7 p.m. (1100 GMT).
