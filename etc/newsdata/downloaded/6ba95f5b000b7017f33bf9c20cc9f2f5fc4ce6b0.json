Business Insider Intelligence\n\nTo do this, sources told The WSJ that the engineers of Amazon's search algorithm started checking its performance for profitability alongside other metrics they'd long considered, like the dollar value of orders, though an Amazon spokeswoman told The WSJ that the e-tailer hasn't changed the criteria it uses to rank search results to include profitability.\n\nAny changes to Amazon's product search can be extremely impactful because many consumers begin their product searches on Amazon. Two-thirds of US consumers start their searches for new products on Amazon and 74% go to Amazon first when looking for a specific item, according to a report from Feedvisor. This means that search results on Amazon directly impact most consumers' online purchase process, especially because 87% of product clicks on Amazon come from product search and more than two-thirds of product views on the marketplace come from products on the first page of search results, per Jumpshot.\n\nBecause of its search's influence, promoting profitable items would likely boost Amazon's performance but hurt third-party sellers'.\n\nBy making its marketplace more profitable for itself, Amazon can improve its operations and more easily offer costly services like on-demand delivery and Prime. Last-mile delivery can be expensive and Prime bundles a number of offerings together at a $119 annual price tag that may undervalue its worth, but Amazon offers both to drive loyalty and repeat purchases. If Amazon's core retail business is more profitable because of the promotion of its private labels and other items that have good margins for Amazon, it would likely be easier for Amazon to offer services like Prime and speedy delivery at a potential loss.\n\nBut third-party sellers may have a harder time operating on Amazon if it's favoring profitable products like its own private labels. Third-party merchants accounted for 58% of physical gross merchandise sales on Amazon in 2018, and many merchants relyon Amazon's marketplace to bring in most of their revenue. But if Amazon's search surfaces products that are profitable for Amazon, these merchants may have a harder time reaching consumers or have to change their operations to become more profitable for Amazon \u2014 by changing the quantities they sell in or how their fulfillment process works, for example \u2014 which could hurt their own bottom lines.\n\nThis move by Amazon may bother the US and EU regulatory bodies that are already investigating its practices over antitrust concerns. Changing its algorithm to promote products that benefit it most would be a prime example of Amazon benefiting from its position as both a marketplace and a merchant on the marketplace.\n\nThis is an advantage that no other seller has on Amazon, and if the regulators take issue with it and Amazon's other, similar practices, including promoting its private labels on product pages and listings for competing items, it could result in fines, regulations, and more that impact Amazon's business.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
