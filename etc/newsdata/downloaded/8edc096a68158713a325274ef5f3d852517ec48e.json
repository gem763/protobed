Some heroic defending from Aden Flint and Sean Morrison ensured the Owls' lead stayed at a single goal, before the hosts finally started to threaten.\n\nWard had Cardiff's first shot on target after 70 minutes before Josh Murphy's deflected cross looped over the head of Cameron Dawson and flashed just past the post.\n\nBut the breakthrough finally came after Tomlin dusted himself off after he was tripped by Massimo Luongo and sent a bending effort into the corner from 25 yards out to level the scores.", "description": "JAMES CANDY AT THE CARDIFF CITY STADIUM: Lee Tomlin halted Sheffield Wednesday's march to the automatic promotion places as his stunning free-kick salvaged a draw for Cardiff.", "authors": ["James Candy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/22/19903680-0-image-a-18_1571432680837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
