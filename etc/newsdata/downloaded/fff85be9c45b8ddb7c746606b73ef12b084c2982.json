By the end of the game, the Brewers held a big, early lead at Cincinnati.\n\n\u201cNothing about this game that didn\u2019t indicate that we were all in,\u201d manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe scored seven runs. We had the go-ahead run with Goldschmidt up at the plate. if you want more than that, I\u2019d like to see you conjure it up.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis and Arizona were back on the field about 11 hours after the Diamondbacks\u2018 3-2 win in 19 innings, a game that took nearly seven hours Tuesday. Cardinals starter Michael Wacha was pulled in the second inning with tightness in his right shoulder.\n\nShildt said more would be known Thursday, but that it appears to be a mild strain. The injury forced the already-taxed Cardinals to go to their bullpen much earlier than desired.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re down four in the ninth. Teams with heart would pack that in,\u201d Schildt said. \u201cTeams with unbelievably high character and competitiveness and desire fight like crazy, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nErrors by rookie infielder Tommy Edman and catcher Matt Wieters helped Arizona score seven times in the sixth for a 9-5 lead. Wilmer Flores homered during the burst, which also included a run-scoring wild pitch.\n\nThe Cardinals loaded the bases with one out in the ninth and Wieters hit a two-run single. Goldschmidt was up next - he had homered in the first two games of the series, marking his return to the desert after the Diamondbacks traded their longtime star to St. Louis in the offseason.\n\nFacing former teammate Archie Bradley, Goldschmidt hit a grounder and Arizona turned two to end it. Bradley got his 17th save.\n\n\u201cWe were ready to go. They played a little bit better than us, made one more pitch, one more hit. It\u2019s no big deal, we\u2019re used to it,\u201d Goldschmidt said.\n\nMerrill Kelly (13-14) exited trailing 5-2 after six innings and wound up with the win.\n\nReliever Junior Fernandez (0-1) took the loss.\n\nCardinals rookie outfielder Randy Arozarena hit his first major league home run, stole home and threw out a runner at third base. Martinez added a triple, double and two RBIs.\n\nFlores hit a two-run double in the first, and Wacha left with two outs in the second. Wacha has pitched well recently, but is 0-3 in 10 starts since rejoining the rotation in early August.\n\nOnly a combined three players from both teams who played the entirety of Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s marathon were in the starting lineup Wednesday, and all played the whole game.\n\n\u201cIt was a solid win on a day we were gassed,\u201d Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cThere was sloppy moments, and I expected that. We managed through those times.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis took the lead in the fourth on the Cardinals\u2018 first steal of home plate since September 2012. Arozarena beat the tag at home plate after a dropped pickoff throw to first base. The Diamondbacks lost their challenge of the safe call on the play.\n\nArozarena\u2019s home run to left field in the top of the sixth gave the Cardinals a 5-2 lead.\n\n\u201cI feel 50-50 happy,\u201d Arozarena said in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m happy with what I did but would have liked our team to win. Everything is positive for us. Last night was so long, but that\u2019s baseball in the big leagues. You\u2019ve got to put it behind you.\u201d\n\nHIGH PRAISE\n\nWatching Yadier Molina still looking spry and energetic in the 19th inning of Tuesday night\u2019s game, Cardinals manager Mike Shildt only further came away impressed with his star catcher, who played the entire game on Tuesday before getting Wednesday off.\n\n\u201cBeen around professional baseball for 43 years or close to it,\u201d Shildt said before Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cI can confidently say, no slight to anyone - smartest, toughest, biggest heart of anyone I\u2019ve seen in this game in all of those individual categories.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCardinals: 2B Kolten Wong (hamstring) is set to hit on the field at Busch Stadium on Thursday, an off day. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more after (Thursday), but he\u2019s getting close,\u201d Shildt said.\n\nDiamondbacks: OF Abraham Almonte pulled up trying to reach down for what ended up being Martinez\u2019s triple in the fifth, and left the game. His injury was announced as a strained left hamstring. \u2026 RHP Taijuan Walker (Tommy John surgery in 2018, shoulder injury) is scheduled for a bullpen session on Thursday. Walker hasn\u2019t pitched all season but could make a start before it ends. \u2026 Manager Torey Lovullo said the team has decided to shut down pitchers Zac Gallen, who threw 80 innings for Miami and Arizona since June, and Luke Weaver, who after being out since late May with forearm tightness recently came back for a major league appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: After a day off for the team, RHP Dakota Hudson (16-7, 3.45 ERA) is scheduled to start at home Friday in the series opener with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nDiamondbacks: RHP Taylor Clarke (5-5, 5.40 ERA) is set for his first career start against the San Diego Padres on Friday after Arizona has the day off.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A lineup of almost all reserves wasn't enough for the St. Louis Cardinals against the Arizona Diamondbacks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jose M.
