I had a really nice start, managed to get the lead and then the pace was super good, I could really control the race.\"\n\n\n\nFerrari had enjoyed a front row lock-out in a rare morning qualifying session caused by Typhoon Hagibis but their race unravelled right at the start.\n\nVettel twitched before the lights went out and his hesitation enabled the fast starting Bottas to leapfrog from third into the lead.\n\n\n\n\"It was my mistake\" admitted Vettel. \"I lost momentum there. Mercedes had more pace than us, was a tough afternoon to maintain second.\"\n\n\n\nMax Verstappen enjoyed a bullet start from fifth in the Red Bull and was overtaking Leclerc on the outside of turn two when the Monegasque drove into the flying Dutchman, causing him to spin.\n\n\n\n\"He just drove into the side of my car,\" complained an unhappy Verstappen.\n\n\n\nLeclerc's front wing was damaged and with bits flying off in all directions -- one demolishing the wing mirror of Hamilton just behind -- he was forced to pit for a new nose at the start of lap four.\n\n\n\nHe rejoined in 18th position, fittingly a place behind Verstappen who appeared to be the helpless victim of their collision.\n\n'What do I have to do'\n\nVettel, who escaped sanction for his false start, was left sandwiched between the two Mercedes and made the first strategic move when he dived in the pits for a new set of soft tyres on lap 17.\n\nBottas followed from the lead on the next lap to take a new set of mediums emerging ahead of Vettel, meaning both the Finn and the German would need to stop again before the end of the 53 lap race.\n\n\n\nHamilton was now in the lead and Mercedes tried to leave him out on a one-stop strategy. But on lap 22 Hamilton reported his front tyres were \"dead\" and was brought in for a fresh set of medium tyres, rejoining in third.\n\n\n\nHamilton began to close on Vettel who pitted for his final change to medium tyres on lap 32, rejoining in third.\n\n\n\nBottas took on fresh soft tyres five laps later leaving Hamilton again in the lead.\n\n\n\n\"Tell me what I have to do to win this race,\" pleaded Hamilton over team radio, convinced his tyres would not last the distance.\n\n\n\nHe came in again on lap 43, allowing Vettel back into second but with only a slim three-second cushion, which the Englishman proceeded to eat into by setting a new lap record.\n\n\n\nHamilton swarmed all over Vettel in the closing laps but was unable to get past and make it a Mercedes one-two.\n\n\n\nEarlier Vettel had produced a perfect lap in the delayed qualifying session to outqualify his teammate for the first time in 10 races since the Canadian Grand Prix in June.\n\n\n\nThe day had been dubbed \"Super Sunday\" with qualifying and the race taking place back-to-back because of the track having been safely locked down Saturday as Typhoon Hagibis roared past.\n\n", "description": "Valtteri Bottas won the Japanese Grand Prix with Sebastian Vettel second in a Ferrari and the Finn's Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in third.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2865/dba38f40d29045cdb3ba28a4b38ae941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
