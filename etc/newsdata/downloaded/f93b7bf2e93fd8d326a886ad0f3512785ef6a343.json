He's the promoter and we're at their behest. We're realistic and we're just waiting to hear back from Matchroom,' Higgins told Sky Sports.\n\nHe then revealed that his fighter is back in training and described what the spider bite did to Parker.\n\nHe added: 'He's in good spirits, he's back in training. I saw the British media sort of mocked the spider bite thing, but the honest feeling for the doctors, we think it actually was a spider bite.\n\nParker celebrates victory over Alexander Flores. He hopes for a fight before the year's out\n\n'I'm no expert, but it sort of destroys your immune system, your health. You are fatigued. He was ordered by medical professionals to stand down for three weeks.\n\n'Make no mistake, we wanted to fight Chisora, we still do. We'll just see what happens.'\n\nA swift win over Price could see Chisora ready for another bout before the end of 2019, and the Parker team will be looking on with interest.\n\nBut Higgins added that it's up to promoters Eddie Hearn or Frank Smith to try and wedge them onto the New York or Saudi Arabian cards.\n\nDavid Price takes part in a media workout after standing in to take the Chisora fight\n\n'It would be a shame if Joseph had to sit out for eight months, but we remain hopeful,' he added.\n\nThis hiccup on the card hasn't been the first. Last month, Chisora himself threatened to pull the plug in a bizarre press conference rant.\n\nHe demanded more money for the bout and said to a perplexed Hearn: 'Who's the main event of this fight? I'm not selling out the O2 to main event for these boys.'\n\n'You want to put these guys, and nobody knows about them, on my show, and try and mug me off.\n\n'No cares about the Muhammad Ali trophy (the prize Taylor and Prograis are competing for). If I'm not going to main event I want more money or I'm pulling out the show.\n\n'Boxing right now is thriving on the heavyweights.'", "description": "The New Zealander, who is a former WBO heavyweight champion, was set to take on the Brit in a heavyweight clash at the O2 Arena on October 26 before a spider bite forced him to pull out.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19697242-0-image-a-64_1571064478029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
