Mantha also scored in Detroit's season-opening win in Nashville on Saturday.\n\nMantha scored with 54 seconds to go when he took a pass from Filip Hronek and his shot deflected off a Dallas defenseman and past goaltender Anton Khudobin.\n\nJonathan Bernier made 19 saves, including a pad save in the closing seconds against Alexander Radulov to preserve the victory.\n\nRoope Hintz scored two goals for Dallas, which has lost three one-goal decisions to start the season. Tyler Seguin recorded the Stars' other goal.\n\nThe Stars led 2-0 after the first period.\n\nHintz scored his second goal of the season midway through the period. Hintz received a pass at center ice, advanced to the left circle and beat Bernier on the glove side.\n\nSeguin gave Dallas a two-goal advantage at 16:49 of the period. He skated out of his own zone along the left side, got behind Wings center Dylan Larkin and beat Bernier top shelf.\n\nMantha's second-period goals tied it up.\n\nHis first came on a power play during the opening minute of the period. He one-timed a pass from Taro Hirose from just beyond the right circle past Khudobin.\n\nDanny DeKeyser and Hronek assisted on his second goal of the night but it was mostly an individual effort. Mantha skated around a defender and made a power move to the net, where he beat Khudobin on the stick side.\n\nMantha notched the hat trick just 15 seconds into the third period. Larkin backhanded a shot that skittered off Khudobin's right pad and Mantha, camped out in front, flicked it into the goal.\n\nThe Stars tied it just 33 seconds later on Hintz's second goal of the night. He shoveled in a rebound of a Mattias Janmark shot.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Anthony Mantha scored all four of the Detroit Red Wings goals, including the  game-winner in the final minute, as his team won its home opener 4-3 over the ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
