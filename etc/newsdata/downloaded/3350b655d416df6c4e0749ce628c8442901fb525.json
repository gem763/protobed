It\u2019s of particular concern for Japan, which after experiencing a major boom throughout the 20th Century is now seeing steep population contraction. In 2018 the lowest number of babies were born since the country began keeping records, while deaths steadily outpaced births.\n\nAnd, as populations decline in countries across the globe, the demand for housing will also drop as the number of households decreases. This is already happening in Japan, where the country\u2019s dramatically ageing population is fuelling a massive inventory of vacant homes. Known as \u2018akiya\u2019, these are homes left abandoned without heirs or new tenants. A record high of 13.6% properties across Japan were registered as akiya in 2018, and the problem is predicted to get worse; not only do relatives want to avoid inheriting homes due to Japan\u2019s second-home tax, but there are fewer citizens overall to occupy them.\n\nAkiya dot the landscape all over Japan, listed in \u2018akiya banks\u2019 from Tokyo prefecture to rural Okayama prefecture to mountainous Kumamoto prefecture in Kyushu, at the southern end of the Japanese archipelago. Akiya are particularly concentrated in rural areas as younger generations abandon their roots in favour of settling in cities where there are more opportunities \u2013 a phenomenon that\u2019s causing dramatic global population shift around the world.", "description": "With more than 20% of its population aged 70 and older and the birth rate declining, Japan has a property problem: there are more homes than people to live in them.", "authors": ["Mari Shibata"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/5y/p07r5y63.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
