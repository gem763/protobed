FOREX-Trade deal buzz bolsters yuan, softens dollar and yen\n\n* Dollar softens, yuan hits three-week high on trade hopes\n\n* Brexit breakthrough chance drives sterling up 2% Thursday\n\n* Trump meets Chinese chief negotiator at 1845 GMT\n\n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano and Tom Westbrook\n\nTOKYO/SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Hopes of progress in\n\nU.S.-China trade talks held down the dollar and lifted riskier\n\ncurrencies on Friday, while optimistic comments from Europe on\n\nBrexit boosted the British pound.\n\nThe greenback was a little weaker against the yuan and the\n\nAustralian and New Zealand dollars as well as the euro, though\n\nmovements were slight as caution tempered enthusiasm for risk.\n\n\"All it takes is one tweet, one headline to change the\n\nlandscape,\" analysts at OCBC Bank in Singapore said in an email.\n\n\"The current situation points to a heavy USD posture, but\n\ngiven the shifty sentiments, we urge caution in excessively\n\nchasing the risk-on trades higher.\"\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a first day of\n\ntrade talks on Thursday, with U.S. President Donald Trump\n\ndescribing the meetings as \"very, very good negotiation with\n\nChina\".\n\nBusiness groups, too, expressed optimism the two sides might\n\nbe able to ease a trade war that has sapped economic growth\n\naround the globe. And a scheduled meeting between Trump and China's Vice\n\nPremier Liu He, the chief Chinese negotiator, at 1845 GMT is\n\nseen as a further positive, after the U.S. blacklisting of some\n\nChinese technology firms made for a bumpy lead-in to the talks.\n\nImproved risk appetite pushed the safe-haven yen\n\nlower to 108.00 per dollar, its weakest since Oct. 1, and lifted\n\nthe Chinese yuan to 7.0983 per dollar, its strongest\n\nsince Sept. 23.\n\n\"Investors are ready to celebrate any form of a U.S.-China\n\ntrade deal, even a limited one,\" said FXTM analyst Han Tan.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the greenback was a little\n\nsofter at 98.655 . The Australian dollar rose 0.3%\n\nto a two-week high of $0.6782 and the kiwi edged higher\n\nto $0.6320.\n\nAlso undermining the dollar, data showed on Thursday U.S.\n\nconsumer prices were unchanged in September and underlying\n\ninflation retreated, supporting expectations the Federal Reserve\n\nwill cut interest rates in October.\n\nThe euro rose 0.1% to $1.1013.\n\nSterling was little changed, but at $1.2437 sat just under a\n\ntwo-week high it hit after soaring 2% overnight, its largest\n\ndaily percentage gain in seven months, driven by hopes for a\n\nBrexit resolution.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a Brexit\n\ndeal could be clinched by the end of October to allow the United\n\nKingdom to leave the European Union, after what he called a very\n\npositive meeting with Boris Johnson. Ireland is a major factor in the prolonged Brexit impasse,\n\nthough details of the pair's discussion or parameters of a\n\npossible breakthrough were scarce.\n\n\"There is a lot to play for still and the script can change\n\nat any moment in Brexit, so it's tough staying long GBP for any\n\nperiod of time,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at\n\nbrokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.\n\n\"It does feel that ahead of the (British parliament meeting\n\non) 19th October that traders will be buyers of weakness, but\n\nit's risky and, given the implied volatility, I would be keeping\n\nmy position size to a minimum.\"\n\nEditing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "FOREX-Trade deal buzz bolsters yuan, softens dollar and yen", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC220WE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
