Because they're losing their jobs and because their supply chain is going to hell, and companies are moving out of China, and they're moving to lots of other places including the United States. And that's not good. That's far worse than they thought. And by the way, in the meantime, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. We\u2019re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs, and we're helping our farmers who got targeted now.\"\n\nThe next round of trade talks between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and China Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to take place in October.\n\nFOX Business\u2019 Blair Shiff contributed to this report.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "China's talks are progressing, said Larry Kudlow.", "authors": ["Julia Limitone"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/larry-kudlow-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
