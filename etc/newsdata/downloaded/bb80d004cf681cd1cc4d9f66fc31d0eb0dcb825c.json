For years, Oromo people had complained of cultural and political marginalisation.\n\nBut some say it is an attempt by the ruling party to cultivate popular support ahead of next year's general election, reports the BBC's Kalkidan Yibeltal.\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nThere are thought to be at least 40 million Oromos in Ethiopia, making up more than 30% of the population.\n\nWithin the Oromos there are many different traditions associated with where people come from, and Irreecha brings them all together.\n\nThe celebration is a chance for people to wear traditional costume.\n\nThis man, from the Shoa region, are wearing \"Daabe\", made from baboon skin.\n\nThe beadwork, known as chelie, that these women are wearing on their foreheads is common to all Oromos, but their clothes are typical of people from the Borena region.\n\nThese men made the 400km journey from Bale, in southern Ethiopia, to join in the festivities.
