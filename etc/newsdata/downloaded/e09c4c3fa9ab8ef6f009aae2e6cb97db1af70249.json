Any day now a politician is bound to call for the return of military conscription of our youths into national service. David Cameron was trying to get there with his National Citizens Service, before events, as they say, got in the way.\n\nLots of countries still do this, especially if they\u2019re near to Russia and its tendency to annex bits of other states. That\u2019s not the issue for the UK, but politicians like the idea of military service knocking our wayward teenagers into shape, physically and otherwise.\n\nSo is military conscription what 21st-century Britain needs to get discipline up and crime down? No, says an Economic Journal study of conscription in Sweden. Indeed, it has the exact opposite effect, with military service significantly increasing the chances of young men committing crime afterwards \u2013 convictions go up by 32%. The effect is driven by young men from disadvantaged groups or who had criminal histories. In part that is because military service means they are less likely to get established in jobs.

If any of them veer off track and start banging on about national service, consider it your national duty to put them straight.\n\n\u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.
