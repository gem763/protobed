It\u2019s a wonderful, funny, quiet movie that manages to do so much inside such a seemingly tiny story about a family trying to keep a secret from a grandmother.\n\nOne of the things that makes The Farewell so wonderful is how it flips lost in translation stories on their heads. Its main character, Billi, is dropped inside a culture she doesn\u2019t entirely understand. But the film simultaneously offers both perspectives: her family may be strange for carrying out this elaborate lie, but it\u2019s Billi who\u2019s truly strange for not understanding why they all would want to.\n\nThat makes for some delightful comedy and heartfelt moments. It\u2019s also very much something that American cinema largely couldn\u2019t have produced in decades past due to how insular the industry is and unwelcome it\u2019s been to unfamiliar stories.\n\nCheck out 11 trailers from this week below.\n\nKnives Out\n\nThere\u2019s a new trailer for Knives Out, Rian Johnson\u2019s directorial follow-up to The Last Jedi. It\u2019s a much smaller-scale film that seems to be designed around letting a bunch of big personalities constantly unload on one another. It comes out on November 27th.\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nThe children\u2019s classic The Secret Garden is getting a gorgeous new adaptation that looks like it plays up the story\u2019s magical elements and imagery. It comes out sometime next spring.\n\nRaising Dion\n\nMichael B. Jordan executive produces (and briefly appears in) this new series about a young boy who begins to develop superpowers. While a lot of the story beats look familiar (\u201cgovernment must take away special kid\u201d), it feels like the show could have a much more interesting emotional core behind those elements. It comes out on October 4th.\n\nDickinson\n\nThis show needs to stop looking so good because I really do not want to subscribe to Apple TV Plus for a single series. But I\u2019m legitimately hyped for Dickinson right now. The show premieres on November 1st.\n\nLiving With Yourself\n\nThis really silly premise \u2014 there are two Paul Rudds \u2014 could have been the setup for a totally okay comedy, but Living With Yourself seems to take that conceit in a much weirder and darker direction that looks like it could be even more fun. It comes out on October 18th.\n\nDaybreak\n\nThe pitch for this show seems to have been Ferris Bueller x Mad Max, and... what if that was actually a great idea? It comes out on October 24th.\n\nThe Rhythm Section\n\nReed Morano, who\u2019s known for directing the first several episodes of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, has a new film coming out that seems to be a punk rock revenge film with Blake Lively in the lead. It comes out on January 31st.\n\nLiving Undocumented\n\nNetflix has an upcoming documentary that speaks to a number of families living unauthorized in the United States, showing the fear and challenges they face just trying to live their lives, raise a family, or go to school. It comes out on October 2nd.\n\nDark Waters\n\nThe next film from Carol director Todd Haynes is a legal thriller that has Mark Ruffalo playing a lawyer who sues DuPont for poisoning the water of a small town. It\u2019s based on a real lawsuit, which resulted in more than $670 million in payouts. The film comes out on November 22nd.\n\nIn the Tall Grass\n\nNetflix is getting an adaptation of In the Tall Grass, the novella from Stephen King and Joe Hill about an inescapable, evil field of grass. It\u2019s a ridiculous story to describe, but it looks like a good horror premise. It comes out on October 4th.\n\nCountdown\n\nThis movie is about people being murdered by an app, which is also a demon. I love it.", "description": "Watch this week\u2019s best new trailers from Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and more, including a look at Michael B.
