That is an irresponsible remark as he mistakenly treats the people\u2019s quest for democracy as an attempt to split China. pic.twitter.com/DE8tbMuzxo \u2014 Joshua Wong \u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2 \ud83d\ude37 (@joshuawongcf) October 16, 2019\n\nA legislator named Tanya Chan decided to shine a projector on Lam\u2019s podium to cover it with the \u201cfive demands\u201d message, a prank LegCo President Andrew Leung thought was a step too far. Leung suspended the meeting for fifteen minutes and called for more orderly behavior, but more pro-democracy legislators got their hands on projectors and bathed the podium in protest slogans, while the chamber rang with more chants.\n\nLeung canceled the meeting altogether and Lam departed the legislative building chased by pro-democracy lawmakers who were blocked from pursuing her by security. Chan declared Lam was the true \u201cculprit inciting the protests.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong Free Press puckishly noted Chinese media cut the streaming video feed from LegCo as soon as the heckling began, replacing it with \u201cimages of rural China.\u201d\n\nAfter departing LegCo, Lam was asked by reporters if she had lost the ability and legitimacy to govern.\n\n\u201cOf course I understand that as a result of these four months of social unrest, many people are very unhappy with the situation and even with the government, because we cannot promise them when things will get back to normal, and for some, we cannot promise them the things they want us to do, but this doesn\u2019t mean we have no will to govern,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cThe will and determination to govern is still there,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s why despite the pressure and the time constraints in the past months, my colleagues have pulled together a very substantive policy address and the supplement of more than 220 initiatives. And we will put our minds together to implement all of these.\u201d\n\nSome of the initiatives Lam mentioned are related to Hong Kong\u2019s housing crisis, widely seen as one of the reasons so many citizens, especially young people, were restless enough to erupt into a historically huge and determined protest movement in response to Lam\u2019s now-withdrawn extradition bill. Others are pro-business measures designed to shore up support from Hong Kong\u2019s business community, which is increasingly nervous about the economic fallout from the protests.\n\n\u201cTo nobody\u2019s surprise, none of the measures addressed protesters\u2019 demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police\u2019s alleged abuse of power. Instead, housing and economic measures were dominant,\u201d the South China Morning Post editorialized after watching Lam\u2019s belated policy address on video.\n\nLam concluded her address by looking forward to the day Hong Kong can \u201cemerge from the storm and embrace the rainbow,\u201d thanks to \u201cthe spirit of the rule of law, the freedom of expression, and the unique advantage brought by the one country, two systems.\u201d\n\nThis approach sounds less like Lam delivering on her pledge to consider the concerns of protesters, and more like an effort to peel off soft supporters who were really upset by high housing prices and economic troubles. Ardent members of the protest movement would definitely quarrel with her assertion that Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d relationship with China is a \u201cunique advantage.\u201d", "description": "Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam is heckled out of delivering a scheduled policy address to the legislature.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181460762-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
