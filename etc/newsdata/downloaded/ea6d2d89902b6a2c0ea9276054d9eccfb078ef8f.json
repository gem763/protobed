Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed mandatory buyback of semi-automatic rifles is a losing issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where you get away with that,\u201d the liberal host said after Thursday night\u2019s Democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nDuring the debate, Mr. O\u2019Rourke reiterated his plan to ban \u201cassault\u201d weapons and implement a mandatory, federal gun buyback program.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take you AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d the former Texas congressman declared to a round of applause.\n\nMr. Matthews later described the position as \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evening began with calls for unity,\u201d the host said during his post-debate analysis. \u201cI think it was a pushback against hard ideology of the Democratic left. That was the theme for a while, but then I thought some of the strong ideologues, the people who have strong agendas like [Elizabeth] Warren and Bernie Sanders were very clear where they stand: \u2018Medicare for All,\u2019 no more private insurance, absolute position on that. Bernie and her competed on paying off all the student loans.\n\n\u201cThen Beto came along and said he\u2019s going to not just buy back automatic \u2014 the semi-automatic assault rifles, but demand that they sell them back. I don\u2019t know where you get away with that,\u201d he continued. \u201cI noticed that Kamala [Harris] talked about an executive order. This would be an extraordinary ruling by the Supreme Court that would allow a president to use executive orders to demand the end of ownership by automatic weapons \u2014 by semi-automatic assault weapons.\n\n\u201cI just think these are three or four cases of extreme, ideological positions,\u201d he added. \u201cBut generally, I thought there was a pushback on that stage against the hard left. I heard a lot of calls for unity.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
