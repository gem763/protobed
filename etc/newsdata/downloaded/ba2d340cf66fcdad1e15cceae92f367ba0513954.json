Brown played just one game for the Patriots before he was released amid an NFL investigation into multiple allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him.\n\nThe NFL Players Association is already preparing a grievance filing on Brown\u2019s behalf, FOX Business confirmed this week. While the Patriots are expected to lean on language in Brown\u2019s contract related to off-field conduct to justify nonpayment of his bonus money \u2013 specifically, his failure to disclosure a situation that could impact his ability to play -- an independent arbitrator is likely to side with Brown, according to Daniel Wallach, a sports attorney and legal analyst for The Athletic.\n\n\u201cAB should win grievance and collect all $9M of his signing bonus, which can never be forfeited except in 4 circumstances, none of which apply here,\u201d Wallach wrote on Twitter. \u201c[The NFL collective-bargaining agreement] bars use of other contract provisions. In any event, Patriots waived disclosure issue when they played AB vs. Dolphins.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the collective-bargaining agreement, players can only commit a \u201cforfeitable breach\u201d that would allow teams to claw back bonuses under four circumstances: failure to report to practice or play, an inability to play due to incarceration, an inability to play due to a non-football injury, or voluntary retirement. None of those clauses apply to Brown.\n\nBrown\u2019s contract with the Patriots included language that states the team could void guarantees if Brown \u201ctakes any action that materially undermines the public\u2019s respect for, or is materially critical of, the club, player\u2019s teammates or the club\u2019s ownership, coaches, management, operations or policies,\u201d The MMQB reported. It\u2019s unclear if that clause would hold up under scrutiny, given a collectively-bargained provision that prevents use of forfeitable breach language outside the four detailed circumstances.\n\nBrown signed a one-year, $15 million contract with the Patriots that included $10 million guaranteed, including $9 million in signing bonus and $1 million in guaranteed salary.\n\nBrown\u2019s former personal trainer filed a civil lawsuit against him earlier this month alleging that he sexually assaulted and raped her during three incidents in 2017 and 2018. A second accuser said Brown exposed himself to her while she painted a mural at his Pittsburgh-area home.\n\nThe Patriots released him last week, hours after Sports Illustrated reported that Brown had sent threatening text messages to the second accuser. The NFL has an open investigation into the situation.\n\nIn a social media tirade last Sunday, Brown said it \u201cwill not be playing in the NFL anymore\u201d because \u201cthese owners can cancel deals.\u201d He also ripped Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was charged with solicitation in connection to a police investigation of a Florida massage parlor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"Kraft [is] never writing that check, no matter what the ruling is now,\u201d a source told ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter.", "description": "The withheld $5 million payment was the first installment toward the $9 million signing bonus Brown was due to receive under the terms of his one-year contract with the Patriots.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/antonio-brown-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
