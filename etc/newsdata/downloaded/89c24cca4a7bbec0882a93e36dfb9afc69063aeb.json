History is not on his side", "language": "en", "text": "Each week for the rest of the season, we will highlight the five players we think are the top Heisman Trophy contenders. The list could change weekly as new players emerge and the true candidates separate themselves from the pack.\n\nPreviously: Preseason, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, Week 8\n\nOnly one defensive player has ever won the Heisman Trophy \u2014 Michigan\u2019s Charles Woodson in 1997. That is unlikely to change in 2019, but Ohio State defensive end Chase Young has barreled his way into the conversation.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nYoung put forth an absolutely dominant display in Ohio State\u2019s 38-7 victory over Wisconsin on Saturday, compiling a ridiculous six tackles, five tackles for loss and four sacks on a rainy afternoon in Columbus. Young was by far the most dominant player on a field full of future pros \u2014 Wisconsin churns out NFL linemen on a yearly basis \u2014 and upped his sack total to an FBS-leading 13.5 in eight games.\n\nYoung is entering a stratosphere of defensive line dominance occupied by players like Ndamukong Suh and Jadeveon Clowney and it\u2019s hard to argue that anybody other than Young is the best player in college football.\n\nBut the Heisman has historically been an award slanted toward offense. Aside from Woodson\u2019s historic win, only two defensive players \u2014 Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te\u2019o (2012) and Pittsburgh defensive lineman Hugh Green (1980) \u2014 have finished as the runner-up for the award.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlenty of defensive players have received votes, but they typically appear toward the end of voters\u2019 ballots. In the last 50 years, only six defensive linemen (13 defensive players overall including Woodson) have finished in the top five of voting \u2014 with Suh being the most recent in 2009 when he finished fourth. That season, Suh compiled ridiculous statistics from his defensive tackle spot: 85 tackles, 20.5 tackles for loss and 12 sacks. Those stats don\u2019t adequately summarize the totality of Suh\u2019s dominance. And the same can be said for Young.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man amongst boys out there,\u201d a veteran NFL scout told Yahoo Sports\u2019 Pete Thamel. \u201cHe\u2019s getting close to Ndamukong Suh territory. Chase Young makes it look easy.\u201d\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, Young\u2019s chances don\u2019t look good. But other than LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, there hasn\u2019t been an offensive player that has really separated himself from the pack of Heisman contenders.\n\nYoung will need to continue producing at a high level as the season progresses, especially in Ohio State\u2019s biggest games. He should not be discounted from this race.\n\n(Paul Rosales/Yahoo Sports)\n\n1. Joe Burrow, QB, LSU\n\nAgainst the toughest defense he may face all season, Burrow thrived once again. In LSU\u2019s 23-20 win over Auburn \u2014 a win that was not as close as the final score may indicate \u2014 Burrow completed 32-of-42 passes for 321 yards and a touchdown. He also had 31 yards and a score on the ground in the victory, which improved LSU\u2019s record to 8-0 and set up a much-anticipated showdown with No. 1 Alabama in two weeks.\n\nBurrow was hit early and often by Auburn\u2019s star-studded defense, but he managed to play better as the game progressed. There were a few slip-ups, though. Burrow tried a back-shoulder throw toward the goal line but had his pass picked off by Auburn\u2019s Roger McCreary. LSU also failed to score inside the 5-yard line on another possession, but Burrow was only given a chance to throw a quick receiver screen on fourth-and-goal after three straight runs.\n\nStill, the performance marked Burrow\u2019s sixth game with 300-plus passing yards on the season, keeping him at second in the nation with 2,805 yards and 30 touchdowns. Burrow\u2019s 78.8 completion percentage not only leads the nation, but it would mark an FBS record if the season ended today. After a bye week, Burrow has the chance to lead the Tigers to a win in Tuscaloosa \u2014 something LSU hasn\u2019t done since 2011.\n\n(Last week: 1)\n\n2. Chase Young, DE, Ohio State\n\nIt\u2019s not like Young is a new name to those who pay attention to the sport. Young was often overshadowed by Nick Bosa during the early part of 2018, but Bosa\u2019s injury and subsequent departure from Ohio State allowed Young to move into a premier role on the Buckeyes defense.\n\nHe ended up racking up 34 tackles, 15.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks for the season. He notably had three tackles for loss and two sacks in a big road win over Penn State and three sacks in the Big Ten Championship Game. But Young\u2019s performance on Saturday was his best yet \u2014 and he did it against a stellar Wisconsin offensive line, paving the way for a potentially historic run onto Heisman ballots.\n\n(Last week: Unranked)\n\n3. Jalen Hurts, QB, Oklahoma\n\nOklahoma was a surprising upset victim on Saturday at the hands of Kansas State, but you can\u2019t pin the loss on Hurts.\n\nHurts finished the afternoon 19-of-26 through the air for 395 yards, led all participants with 110 rushing yards and scored four combined touchdowns (one passing, three rushing). Those totals bring his season-long efforts to 2,469 yards and 21 touchdowns passing with 801 yards and 13 touchdowns rushing.\n\nBut perhaps Hurts can shoulder a bit of the blame as Kansas State opened up a huge lead in the third quarter. Oklahoma\u2019s offense only had the ball twice in that quarter, and both of those possessions resulted in three-and-outs. From there, though, Hurts led a near-miraculous comeback in the fourth that was spoiled when an onside kick recovered by the Sooners was taken off the board by an illegal touching penalty.\n\nShould Hurts lead the Sooners to a Big 12 title and back into the College Football Playoff mix, he will certainly remain in Heisman contention.\n\n(Last week: 2)\n\n4. J.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State\n\nChase Young wasn\u2019t the only Ohio State player with a monstrous performance against Wisconsin. Running back J.K. Dobbins had another outstanding outing, this time going for 163 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries \u2014 outplaying Wisconsin star Jonathan Taylor in a big way.\n\nWhile Young and the OSU defense kept the game close early on, Dobbins \u2014 along with the passing connection between Justin Fields and Chris Olave \u2014 spurred on the Buckeyes in the second half. Dobbins\u2019 two touchdowns both came in the second half and pretty much erased whatever slim hopes Wisconsin had for a comeback.\n\nDobbins is up to 1,110 rushing yards on the season \u2014 second-best in the nation \u2014 on 7.21 yards per attempt. Dobbins has rushed for at least 120 yards in four straight games and has six efforts of 100-plus yards on the season.\n\n(Last week: Unranked)\n\n5. Tua Tagovailoa, QB, Alabama\n\nWith the LSU game coming up, we\u2019re going to keep Tua Tagovailoa \u2014 currently on the mend after having surgery for a high-ankle sprain on Oct. 20 \u2014 in a somewhat prominent position among Heisman candidates.\n\nWhile Tagovailoa was sidelined, backup Mac Jones performed well in Saturday\u2019s blowout win over Arkansas. Now in a bye week, Alabama\u2019s Wednesday practice will be an important barometer for Tagovailoa\u2019s progress. Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban told reporters Monday that he expects to see his star quarterback at practice on Wednesday, but he was not ready to give a definitive answer as to whether Tagovailoa will be ready to play against No. 2 LSU.\n\n\"We'll have to see what he can do and evaluate his mobility and performance,\" Saban said per ESPN. \"You can't really predict any of those things. You just have to let it happen and see how it goes.\"\n\n(Last week: 3)\n\nTua Tagovailoa wore a walking boot on the sideline during Alabama's game vs. Arkansas. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\n\nAlso considered\n\nChuba Hubbard, RB, Oklahoma State: Hubbard, the nation\u2019s leading rusher with 1,381 yards, helped his team upset No. 23 Iowa State in Ames on Saturday. Hubbard rushed for 116 yards and a touchdown in the 34-27 victory.\n\nJustin Fields, QB, Ohio State: Fields looked a little confused early against a really good Wisconsin defense, but got things straightened out toward the end of the first half when he led OSU on a scoring drive. Fields ended up finishing the game with 167 yards passing, 28 yards rushing and three total touchdowns.\n\nJonathan Taylor, RB, Wisconsin: From a rushing average perspective, Jonathan Taylor had his worst college game against Ohio State. The junior mustered only 52 yards on 20 carries, a 2.6-yard average. Taylor dropped to fifth nationally in rushing yards (1,009).\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Chase Young will need to continue producing at a high level in Ohio State\u2019s biggest games, but he should not be discounted from the Heisman race.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qr02XXDLHE5bhUa_S_jDpg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/y7Pr4MwutOmzwvcZfJEXWg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b348e410-e3c2-11e9-adc7-0808bc4b1863", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
