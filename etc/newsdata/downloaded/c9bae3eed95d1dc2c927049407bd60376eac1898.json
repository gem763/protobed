Living at low densities in the landscape, they forage on fruit, fungi and a range of prey including the grey squirrel, a non-native species which is having a detrimental impact on broadleaf woodland throughout England.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with volunteers, local communities and partner organisations to monitor how the pine martens are moving throughout the Forest of Dean and the wider landscape.\u201d\n\nThe pine martens\u2019 activity will be closely monitored by Dr Catherine McNicol, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust\u2019s conservation project manager.\n\nShe said: \u201cPine martens are elusive and shy animals, with their presence often only indicated by scats in the middle of forestry tracks.\n\n\u201cThey only give birth to a few kits each year if breeding is even successful, so the rate of marten population recovery in the UK is low.\u201d\n\nBut she added it \u201cis hoped that their protection, alongside these reintroductions, will give them the boost they need to become resilient and thrive\u201d.\n\nDr Gareth Parry, director of conservation at Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cWe are in a biodiversity emergency and conserving our remaining wildlife is not enough, we must also take action to support nature\u2019s recovery.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with partners to establish a Nature Recovery Network across the county and bringing back native species, such as pine marten, which play a vital role in ecosystem functioning, is an important part of this work.\u201d", "description": "A few hundred years ago, the beautiful pine marten was found all over the British Isles.
