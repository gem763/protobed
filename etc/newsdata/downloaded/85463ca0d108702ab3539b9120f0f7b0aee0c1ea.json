Can I see how people took that the wrong way? Absolutely. But I never said there was a quid pro quo, because there isn't.\"\n\nMulvaney then said the money was withheld from Ukraine because Trump had concerns about corruption in the country and wanted to make sure that European allies were also delivering aid. Wallace pushed back on that point, saying that \"anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could only come to one conclusion.\"\n\nMulvaney said he could see how people took his comments \"the wrong way\" but said again that was incorrect because he never used the words \"quid pro quo.\"\n\nRead more: Mick Mulvaney tries to claw back his confirmation \u2014 made on live TV \u2014 that Trump threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to secure political dirt on Democrats\n\nWallace pointed out in the press conference, Mulvaney said the aid was withheld for three reasons, not the two he listed on Sunday.\n\n\"You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl if investigating Democrats was one of the conditions for holding up the aid, was part of the quid pro quo, and you said 'it happens all the time,'\" Wallace said, referring to the ABC reporter who had asked the question in the press conference.\n\nRead more: Here's the transcript of Mick Mulvaney's Thursday press briefing \u2014 decide for yourself whether he confirms Trump's Ukraine phone call was an illegal quid pro quo\n\nMulvaney said Thursday that the third issue in the aid money was whether Ukraine was cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the US Justice of Department, which Wallace pointed out, department officials later said was \"news to us.\"\n\nMulvaney said Trump had previously mentioned the investigations, but ultimately corruption and securing other sources of aid for Ukraine were the two primary factors in the decision.\n\nHe also said that the fact that the aid to Ukraine was eventually sent should \"put the matter to bed\" and he had no intention of resigning over the comment.\n\n\"Did I have the perfect press conference, no, but again the facts are on our side,\" Mulvaney concluded.\n\nIn a Sunday appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joined Mulvaney's defense, telling host George Stephanopoulos that he \"never saw [mention of quid pro quo] in the decision-making process.\"\n\nMulvaney's shock comment Thursday ignited House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry who are focused on Trump's dealings with Ukraine and are reportedly planning to call two more diplomats for testimony this week.", "description": "Mulvaney said he could see how people took his comments \"the wrong way\" and that he never technically used the words \"quid pro quo.\"", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daca243cc4a0a75011ce434?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
