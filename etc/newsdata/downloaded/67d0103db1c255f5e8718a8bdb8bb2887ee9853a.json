Crosthwaite to take over. Crosthwaite has spent much of his career at Altria, the tobacco giant that owns brands like Marlboro and Virginia Slims, and also owns about one third of Juul after a $13 billion deal last year.\n\nThe company has been under fire in recent months after a spate of lung-related illnesses among people who vape. Juul products account for about three-quarters of all sales in the fast-growing, $6-billion US industry.\n\nOriginally designed to be a product to help smokers wean themselves off tobacco, vaping and the industry have been criticized for seemingly getting an entirely new generation of people to start consuming tobacco \u2014 especially young people.\n\nThe company recently opened its first branded store in Toronto.
