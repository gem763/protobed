What can they get done?", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The 2020 election is nearing and with that, comes the caucuses and primary elections. But what\u2019s the difference? Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nThe Democrats running for president head into Tuesday's debate with a long list of proposed policy plans and campaign trail promises.\n\nAll have assured voters they fully intend to reverse many of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies and of course install some of their own, should they be elected president.\n\nFrom immigration to climate change, the contenders have announced sweeping legislative priorities for their first days in office. Sen. Kamala Harris alone has named more than half a dozen ideas she wants done within days of her hypothetical inauguration.\n\nBut how much can a president reasonably accomplish during a week that\u2019s also filled with inaugural celebrations?\n\nWhat are the Dems promising in their hypothetical first few days in the White House?\n\nOn her first day in the Oval Office, Democratic hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she will rejoin the international Paris Climate Accord.\n\nOn Day 2, she will bring back Obama-era rules that Trump\u2019s administration replaced, weakening emissions-reduction targets. During September's Democratic debate, Klobuchar also outlined day-by-day targets to tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cAnd on Day 7, you're supposed to rest, but I won't,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nWe need to tackle the climate crisis. Day 1: I will enter the United States back into the International Climate Change Agreement. Day 2 & 3? I'll reinstate the clean power rules and gas mileage standards. #DemDebate \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) September 13, 2019\n\nIf Harris wins the election, she had proposed perhaps the busiest day on Jan. 20, 2021, of all the Democratic candidates.\n\nDuring September's debate, the California senator said, \u201cI plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on Day 1\u201d as part of her plan for criminal justice reform.\n\nHarris says she'll reverse a Republican tax reform bill that went into effect in 2018. She'll also overhaul Trump administration policies on immigration in her first day. Specifically, she plans to reinstate protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients through executive action.\n\n\"I will ensure that this microphone that the president of the United States holds in her hand is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up, separating them from their parents,\" Harris said at the first round of debates in June.\n\nAlso on her agenda for Inauguration Day: Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord; declaring an emergency to invest funds into clean drinking water; and ending the leasing of government-controlled land to fossil fuel companies.\n\nShe also says she'll reverse the Trump administration's ban on transgender people serving in the military, as well as the new rule that prohibits federal Title X funds from going to organizations that perform or refer for abortions.\n\nMore: Planned Parenthood rejects Title X funding over abortion rule: Here's what that means\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has said he'll take executive actions on his first day to close certain loopholes in gun sales. He said at the June debate he will also take action on immigration his first day, including to \"reinstate pathways for citizenship for DACA recipients.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply decriminalize marijuana\u2014we must repair the damage done to those communities that have been most harmed by the failed War on Drugs & we must expunge the records of those who have served their time. The end we seek is not just legalization, it\u2019s justice. \u2014 Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) August 25, 2019\n\nBooker also promised to address criminal justice reform early on. He says he will start issuing clemency to nonviolent drug offenders imprisoned for marijuana crimes and those who were given longer sentences for possession of crack cocaine than those for powder cocaine.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on \"The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\" that he wants to launch a package of reforms to \"strengthen our democracy,\" including making it easier to register to vote and to transition from the electoral college system.\n\nFormer Obama administration Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro said his very first executive order will be to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nCastro has said he will direct his attorney general to reverse Trump administration immigration policies.\n\nAt the first Democratic debate in June, Castro said he would issue an executive order to address the concept of \"metering,\" which is the limitations placed on the number of migrants who can be processed at points of entry each day.\n\nCastro has blamed metering for the deaths of \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his daughter Valeria, who drowned while trying to cross Rio Grande.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke has proposed an overhaul of Trump administration immigration policies. Among other other actions, O'Rourke says he'll sign orders to detain only those with dangerous criminal backgrounds, reverse restrictions on asylum claims for domestic and gang violence, eliminate funding for private detention centers and revoke travel bans.\n\nO'Rourke also has a plan to \"start cutting pollution on day one and taking executive actions to lead on climate.\"\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is also focused on climate.\n\n\"Coastal communities have made it clear: No more offshore drilling that hurts our planet. On day one of a Warren administration, I promise to sign a total moratorium on new offshore drilling,\" she said in a tweet.\n\nAnd Warren says she'll reverse the ban on transgender people in the military.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also wants to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on his first day and sign a series of executive orders on climate.\n\nOn immigration, Biden says he will reverse Trump limitations on asylum and undo executive orders that \"eliminated Obama-Biden enforcement priorities on national security and public safety.\"\n\nOn day one as president, Joe Biden will take action to put the United States on track to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050\n\n\n\nBecause action on climate change can\u2019t wait. #ClimateTownHallpic.twitter.com/YWw0tFodt2 \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 5, 2019\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says he'll sign an executive order on his first day to grant legal status to all DACA recipients and their parents.\n\n\"Day one of my administration: We issue executive orders to undo every damn thing Trump has done to demonize and harm immigrants,\" Sanders tweeted.\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson said the first bill she wants to sign on Day 1 is about, \u201cPublic funding for federal campaigns. Absolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil we override Citizens United, we will continue to experience ourselves functioning more like a veiled aristocracy than like an actual democracy,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nBusinessman Tom Steyer wants to \"declare the climate crisis a national emergency on day one.\" He said he'll end Trump's \"failed Trade War.\"\n\nI\u2019ve been fighting climate change for more than a decade, and I will make it a priority in my Presidency.\n\n\n\nI was the first candidate to say that I\u2019ll declare a national emergency on day one, and the only candidate who has pledged to use the emergency powers of the presidency. \u2014 Tom Steyer (@TomSteyer) September 13, 2019\n\nCould it be an uphill battle?\n\nAn executive order signed by a president does not need to go through Congress to be lawful, but it can face obstacles in the court system or be challenged by later Congressional legislation. A president can also use cabinet picks to affect different agencies, as Trump has done.\n\nStill, the promises Democrats have made won't go without opposition from Republicans, who may or may not retain control of the Senate come 2021.\n\nRepublicans often call some of the more progressive policies Democrats want to enact on immigration evidence that they support \"open borders.\"\n\nGOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, reacting to comments Democrats have made during debates, has said they were \"doubling down on Democrats\u2019 radical, socialist proposals.\"\n\nWhile many Democrats have expressed support for decriminalization of unauthorized border crossings, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has said that \"Civil penalties for illegal crossings will NOT be a deterrent... Decriminalizing illegal entry is Open Borders and a nightmare for national security.\"\n\nNearly all the Democratic candidates have promised action on climate change. But Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, has said that the candidates' plans will result in \"excessive govt intrusion into your everyday life.\"\n\n\"Just like the Green New Deal,\" she added.\n\nLiving up to their predecessors\n\nOn a day that already will be filled with inauguration and various celebrations, and usually some appointing of cabinet officials, the new president in 2021 will need to prioritize.\n\nTrump's first day in 2017 consisted of his inauguration parade and tweeting, yes, but he also put his signature on some of the first documents that would become policy.\n\nHe declared a National Day of Patriotism and nominated some of his administration picks, according to Time. He suspended an existing order on housing.\n\nHis first executive order was signed that day, in which he began his pledged dismantling of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSome other promises he made were action on the U.S. border and a claim to stop the exporting of American jobs.\n\n\"You have executive orders all over the place. So many would be terminated,\" Trump said in a video from February 2016. \"I would get rid of the attack on our Second Amendment because that's what Obama is doing when he does that. I would very, very strongly get rid of the attack on the border.\"\n\n\"That order will be the single first thing I do,\" Trump said about the border.\n\nAmong President Barack Obama's first orders signed in 2009 was one that included a restriction on White House employees from lobbying. Another expanded public access to presidential records. He also spoke with foreign leaders in the Middle East.\n\nWhen asked on the campaign trail what his first move would be in office, Obama said, \"I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/democrats-debate-candidates-have-big-plans/2345433001/", "description": "Kamala Harris has announced more than half a dozen things to enact on her first day as president.
