Kentucky was No. 2 with two first-place votes, while third-ranked Kansas received the other three.\n\nMichigan State had been ranked No. 1 for 12 weeks all-time in the AP poll before Monday, but never to start a season.\n\nTom Izzo\u2019s Spartans return star Cassius Winston, along with starters Joshua Langford, Xavier Tillman and Aaron Henry from a 32-win team that reached the Final Four.\n\nDuke is ranked fourth, followed by Louisville, Florida, Maryland, Gonzaga, North Carolina and Villanova to round out the top 10.\n\nReigning national champion Virginia starts at No. 11.\n\nNFL\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Tom Brady set the tone with a long slice-and-dice touchdown drive, New England\u2019s blitz-happy defense forced Sam Darnold into five turnovers and the Patriots remained undefeated by cruising to a 33-0 victory over the New York Jets on Monday night.\n\nBrady threw a TD pass to Phillip Dorsett and Sony Michel ran for three scores to help the Patriots improve to 7-0 for the third time in franchise history, and first since 2015.\n\nThey also swept the two-game season series against their AFC East rivals for the fourth straight year, outscoring the Jets (1-5) 63-14 in the two meetings this year.\n\nAnd, the top-ranked Patriots defense was a big reason in this one.\n\nDarnold was the AFC offensive player of the week after leading New York to a 24-22 win over Dallas last Sunday in his return from missing three games with mononucleosis.\n\nHe was miserable against New England, finishing 11 of 32 for 86 yards and a 3.6 quarterback rating.\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Dolphins safety Bobby McCain will be disciplined by the team for a verbal confrontation with a 13-year-old boy and for allegedly spitting in the face of another Bills fan following Miami\u2019s loss at Buffalo.\n\nCoach Brian Flores said he discussed the incident with McCain on Monday, the day after the Dolphins\u2019 31-21 loss. Flores wouldn\u2019t say whether McCain will miss playing time as part of the discipline.\n\nErie County Sheriff spokesman Scott Zylka confirms that police are investigating fans\u2019 complaints, working with the Bills and the NFL in reviewing stadium security video. The Buffalo News first reported the investigation.\n\nNBA\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - Zion Williamson will miss the start of the season after the No. 1 overall draft pick by the New Orleans Pelicans had right knee surgery, sidelining the hyped rookie for nearly two months.\n\nWilliamson had his torn right lateral meniscus repaired on Monday. The club says his recovery will last six to eight weeks.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 285-pound former Duke star averaged 23.2 points in four preseason games. He missed New Orleans\u2019 final exhibition game in New York last Friday night.\n\nThe 19-year-old Williamson turned pro after one season in college, during which he averaged 22.6 points and was voted to the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s All-Defensive Team. He also averaged 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 steals and 1.8 blocked shots.\n\nHe was projected to start immediately at forward for New Orleans, alongside guards Lonzo Ball and Jrue Holiday, forward Brandon Ingram and center Derrick Favors.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL\n\nAlabama is about to experience life without Tua Tagovailoa - at least for one game.\n\nFor the first time in two seasons, the top-ranked Crimson Tide are preparing for a game with somebody other than Tagovailoa leading the offense. Mac Jones will take the reins Saturday night against Arkansas while Tagovailoa recovers from a high ankle sprain that sidelined him for much of the Tennessee game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Mac,\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said Monday. \u201cWith a week of preparation, I think he\u2019ll do a lot better in this game.\u201d\n\nWith Alabama still favored by 33 points over the Razorbacks, the big question is, Will Tagovailoa be back in time for the Nov. 9 game against No. 2 LSU as he pledged to teammates after the Tennessee game ? There is an open date in between games and Tagovailoa is familiar with the recovery process from the procedure he had done on Sunday.\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Nebraska running back Maurice Washington is not with the team and won\u2019t play in the Cornhuskers\u2019 home game against Indiana on Saturday.\n\nCoach Scott Frost announced Washington\u2019s status Monday, stopping short of calling it a suspension. Frost said he didn\u2019t see Washington being part of the team\u2019s plans in the \u201cimmediate future.\u201d\n\nWashington has been held out of the first halves of two games for disciplinary reasons. Frost didn\u2019t disclose a reason for Washington\u2019s absence but said players are expected to meet certain standards in order to play. Frost said Washington\u2019s absence is not related to child pornography charges he faces in California.\n\nFrost said Washington has not practiced since the Huskers\u2019 loss at Minnesota on Oct. 12. The Huskers were idle this past Saturday.\n\nGOLF\n\nINZAI CITY, Japan (AP) -Jason Day won the inaugural \u201cThe Challenge: Japan Skins\u201d game on Monday, beating Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nDay won eight skins and $210,000. Woods had five skins and $60,000 with McIlroy taking four and winning $60,000. Matsuyama won only one skin and $20,000.\n\nIt was Woods\u2019 first event after surgery two months ago, the fifth on his left knee.

(AP) - Miguel Angel Jimenez tied the course record with a 9-under 63 on Monday to win the rain-delayed Dominion Energy Charity Classic, the opening event of the PGA Tour Champions\u2019 three-tournament Charles Schwab Cup playoffs.\n\nJimenez made nine birdies on the County Club of Virginia\u2019s James River course and beat second round co-leader Tommy Tolles by two shots. Tolles made an eagle on the par-5 last hole to finish at 4 under and beat Colin Montgomerie by one shot and earn a spot in the second event in the playoffs.\n\nWoody Austin, Bernhard Langer and Scott Parel, the other co-leader after two rounds, finished five shots back.\n\nAustin was on his way to a possible second-place finish at 8 under after 16 holes, but he three-putted the final two holes.\n\nSOCCER\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Major League Soccer has awarded its 29th franchise to Sacramento.\n\nMLS Commissioner Don Garber announced the league\u2019s newest team Monday, joined by Mayor Darrell Steinberg and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nSacramento Republic FC is set to begin play in 2022.\n\nThe team\u2019s ownership group includes lead investor Ron Burkle, an owner of the NHL\u2019s Pittsburgh Penguins, as well as entertainment executive Matt Alvarez and Kevin Nagle, an investor in the NBA\u2019s Sacramento Kings who has spearheaded the bid for MLS expansion since 2014.\n\nThe addition of Burkle and Alvarez earlier this year accelerated negotiations. The Sacramento Republic currently plays in the lower-tier USL Championship league.\n\nPARIS (AP) - Lionel Messi will have Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk as rivals for the 2019 Ballon d\u2019Or award. But not Neymar.\n\nWhen the long list of 30 candidates was announced Monday - in the city where Neymar has played for more than two years at Paris Saint-Germain - the Brazil star\u2019s name was missing from the nominations by a global voting panel of journalists.\n\nMessi and Ronaldo\u2019s 10-year grip on the individual award organized by France Football magazine was broken by Luka Modric last December.\n\nModric is also absent one year after he swept the Ballon d\u2019Or and FIFA best player awards after a stellar 2018 with Real Madrid and Croatia.\n\nMessi won his sixth FIFA award last month, edging Van Dijk who starred in Liverpool\u2019s Champions League-winning team.\n\nTENNIS\n\nSYDNEY (AP) - Australia captain Lleyton Hewitt says he has been willing to overlook Nick Kyrgios\u2019s recent outbursts on the ATP Tour to select the talented but wayward star in his team for the revamped Davis Cup finals.\n\nKyrgios is currently serving six months\u2019 probation on the ATP tour after a meltdown at the Cincinnati tournament in August and calling the ATP \u201cpretty corrupt\u201d during this year\u2019s US Open.\n\nThe suspended sentence applies only to the ATP Tour and not the Davis Cup and Hewitt is confident the 24-year-old Kyrgios will be on his best behavior at the 18-team world finals in Madrid from Nov. 18 to 24.\n\nHewitt said Kyrgios\u2019s latest ban had not affected his decision to select the player in a strong Australian team, drawn in a group with Belgium and Colombia.\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nFour-time Olympian and New York City Marathon champion Shalane Flanagan says she is retiring from competitive running to become a coach.\n\nFlanagan made the announcement on social media on Monday, saying she has only one regret: \u201cI regret I can\u2019t do it all over again.\u201d\n\nA native of Marblehead, Massachusetts, whose mother was the first woman to break 2 hours, 50 minutes in the marathon, Flanagan won a silver medal in the 10,000 meters at the 2008 Olympics.
