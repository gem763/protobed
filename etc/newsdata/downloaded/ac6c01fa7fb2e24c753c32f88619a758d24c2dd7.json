Now that I stay at home, even more than before, especially when my son has his naps!\"\n\nAnd as well as the actual freebies themselves, it's also added a little excitement to her day too.\n\n\u201cEvery time the postman comes to deliver the freebies, it feels like Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\n\"It has been at least a year since I had to buy any skincare products as I get so many samples and full size products to use. This has saved me so much money.\"\n\n(Image: Ana Maria Macovei/Latestdeals.co.uk)\n\nThe good news for the rest of us is that Ana's shared her tricks to getting the best stuff.\n\n\"I apply every day for freebies. You never know when they come: Some days are quiet, other times I get six or seven in a day. The best thing is to apply and forget about it,\" Ana said.\n\n\u201cI only apply for the ones I know I would use myself, or I know I can gift to family and friends. I mainly apply on the links shared on Latest Free Stuff group.\n\n\"Freebies range from skincare samples, food and drinks, to baby car seats and other gadgets.\"\n\n(Image: Ana Maria Macovei/Latestdeals.co.uk)\n\nThere are also more reliable ways to get free things.\n\n\"I have also registered to many product testing sites, such as TryIt sampling, Home Tester Club, Clicks Research, Alba Science and Swift Research.\n\n\"Product testing sites often give out full size products that you can keep in exchange of an honest review. Sometimes they also pay you with Amazon vouchers once you complete a study.\n\n\"I also do surveys - Populus Live is the main one I use as I feel it pays the most.\u201d\n\nThen there are the competitions.\n\n(Image: Ana Maria Macovei/Latestdeals.co.uk)\n\n\u201cThe most expensive competition win I received was a double size Simba mattress and two of their pillows, which was worth around \u00a3800.\u201d\n\nAs well as the matress, Ana has bagged things including a car seat worth \u00a3350, skincare worth more than \u00a350, a water flosser worth \u00a360, a Logitech crayon worth \u00a360 and a lot of food, drink and makeup.\n\nThere are a few things you should do to make your life a bit easier though.\n\n\"For those just starting, I would encourage them to first set up an email address just to use for freebies, and stay away from offers that ask you to pay for P&P, unless they are from a reputable company,\" Ana said.\n\n\"Like as many companies as you can on Facebook , and other social media, as you will often get offers to apply for samples and competitions by doing this.\"\n\n(Image: Ana Maria Macovei/Latestdeals.co.uk)\n\nThen there are the groups you can join where people share the best deal they see.\n\n\"Join LatestFreeStuff.co.uk and the Free Stuff Facebook Group : There is an amazing community of freebie hunters that share offers all the times and also offer advice on what to stay away from (as there are some scammers out there too).\n\n\"Keep an eye on your emails as product testing invites need to be answered quickly.\"\n\nBut there are a couple of warnings, too.\n\n\u201cI have to mention that even if you apply for it, it doesn\u2019t mean you will get it. Companies have a limited number of samples, so the quicker you can apply the better,\" Ana said.\n\n\"That's why I check the Free Stuff group few times a day. I also check emails regularly to be able to accept products testing invites on time. Apply as soon as you see the links, as the quicker you apply, the more chances you have of getting it.\u201d", "description": "Essex-based mum Ana has amassed an incredible haul of freebies online and hasn't needed to buy skincare products for years as a result", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Ana Maria Macovei Latestdeals.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article20583899.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ana-Maria-Macovei72382411_916679332045240_8599256281645056000_n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
