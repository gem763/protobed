Source: Twitter, @NicolasMaduro\n\nVenezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has announced that the central government will hand out a total of USD 543,700 worth of the state-run, oil-backed Petro cryptocurrency to each of the country\u2019s 23 states on a bi-monthly basis.\n\nIn a televised address, Maduro stated that he would oversee the handout of 1 million Petro tokens (USD 23,640) each to the country\u2019s federal state governments every eight weeks \u2013 in an attempt to boost the usership of the oil-backed token.\n\nMaduro claimed that \u201cadditional Petro resources\u201d would also be handed out to local governments as of next month, making for a total payout worth between USD 1.5 million and USD 3.6 million. The president did not specify a time period for this, however. Nor did he mention how long the payout period would last.\n\nThe president said that the states would be free to use the tokens however they see fit, and stated that the move would help with the \u201cmass adoption\u201d of the Petro.\n\nTwitter users have been quick to point out potential flaws in Maduro\u2019s plan. One economics analyst pointed out that per the Petro\u2019s white paper, only 100 million Petro tokens are currently in circulation. But should the government push ahead with its plan, it would end up issuing more than that amount in only a matter of months.\n\nWhether or not Maduro has fudged the figures or made mistakes with his calculations, the government is still forging away with its crypto plans.\n\nThe president stated that he was also assigning Petro funds to state-backed agricultural and industrial projects. He claimed Petro funds would be used to buy \u201csupplies and raw materials\u201d that the country is struggling to purchase due to United States-led economic sanctions, presumably from international vendors. Furthermore, he said he would be assigning \u201cUSD 2 million worth of Petro tokens\u201d to a joint project with China.\n\nThe state cryptocurrency department has recently claimed that 93 stores in the country now accept Petro payment, and Maduro claims that Venezuela has traded in Petro overseas, but would not mention the named of trading partners lest they fall afoul of American sanctions. The United States has warned that it will hit any countries or companies it catches trading in Petros with further sanctions.", "description": "Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has announced that the central government will hand out a total of USD 543,700 million worth of the state-run, oil-backed Petro cryptocurrency to each of the country\u2019s 23 states on a bi-monthly basis.
