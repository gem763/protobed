They were filmed by Elijah Schaffer, a correspondent for The Blaze, a conservative news site \u2014 who was maced as he filmed.\n\nTrump supporters are literally fleeing the event after it ended as protestors are waiting around attacking attendees as they leave the arena It is not safe in Minneapolis any longer for Trump supporters. Please stay away from the vicinity and do not come out with branded gear pic.twitter.com/BLsJbtct0k \u2014 Elijah Schaffer (@ElijahSchaffer) October 11, 2019\n\nThe situation outside the Trump rally in Minnesota is quickly deteriorating Left wing protestors are destroying barricades A protestor can be seen waving the Chinese flag in front of riot police. While people in Hong Kong wave American flags for freedom, we wave Chinese flags pic.twitter.com/XVl551kyqZ \u2014 Elijah Schaffer (@ElijahSchaffer) October 11, 2019\n\nAnti Trump protestors in Minnesota stole about 40 hats off the heads of Trump supporters & then lit them on fire \ud83d\udd25 at the Trump Rally They then left the ashes as a vigil against fascism, leaving a f*ck Trump sign on the top of the pile This is tolerance. This is the left pic.twitter.com/jFhVNXrgId \u2014 Elijah Schaffer (@ElijahSchaffer) October 11, 2019\n\nMy producer and I were bear maced in the face while reporting on the quickly dilapidating situation outside the Minnesota Trump rally Arrests have been made. Antifa is present. Violence is common place at this point. Typical end of the night anarchy pic.twitter.com/ujnDNQIVtf \u2014 Elijah Schaffer (@ElijahSchaffer) October 11, 2019\n\nLocal Minneapolis Star-Tribune reporter Liz Sawyer noted there were several hundred rioters, and that some were singling out Trump supporters and surrounding them in groups before attacking them. Some also attacked police:\n\nLarge groups continue encircling one or two Trump supporters at a time. One guy just had debris thrown at him and got slapped in the face. A videographer stood up for him and helped lead him out if the circle pic.twitter.com/OjfVc34JFJ \u2014 Liz Sawyer (@ByLizSawyer) October 11, 2019\n\nStill several hundred protesters spread out between two groups on 1st Av. Some keep chasing trump supporters away, \u201csaying we don\u2019t want you here.\u201d\n\nOthers have turned their attention to police. \u2014 Liz Sawyer (@ByLizSawyer) October 11, 2019\n\nProtesters completely surrounded a group of Trump supporters, at least one of whom was wearing a body camera on his chest. Some attempted to engage the group in a dialogue for several minutes, before chasing away pic.twitter.com/9jL60oRXlO \u2014 Liz Sawyer (@ByLizSawyer) October 11, 2019\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of the riot outside a convention center in San Jose in June 2016, when anti-Trump rioters attacked Trump supporters leaving the venue in full view of the media \u2014 and Mayor Sam Liccardo blamed Trump.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey proclaimed Thursday as \u201cLove Trumps Hate Day\u201d in the city, in solidarity with protests against Trump. Evidently, however, some of those among the \u201cprotesters\u201d felt \u201chate\u201d trumped \u201clove.\u201d\n\nIn one instance, a bystander who was not a Trump supporter reported being attacked by the anti-Trump mob:\n\nIn this riot of anti-trump. I was just trying to get through with my brother, and I\u2019ve never been called a racist so many times let alone ever. I\u2019ve never been shoved for just walking through for thinking I was a trump supporter. I don\u2019t have opinions on trump but this was wack pic.twitter.com/pGRxFSVRxa \u2014 Kali Finch (@KaliFinch1) October 11, 2019\n\nThe Target Center had attempted to charge the Trump campaign hundreds of thousands of dollars for additional security. The rally itself \u2014 with a capacity crowd inside and tens of thousands outside \u2014 passed without serious incident, but local police seemed unprepared for the violence by anti-Trump rioters after the event was over.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\nJoel B.
