Wall Street is pricing in a 97 percent likelihood that the Fed will cut the rate from under 2 percent now to below 1.75 percent. President Trump wants an even bigger cut, and he has labeled Fed leaders \u201cboneheads\u201d for not slashing rates faster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA key question for Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell is what to do after this week. Wall Street investors do not expect another reduction this year, and views are split on what the central bank will do in 2020. Powell has tried to keep the Fed out of the political fray, and he and his colleagues are aware that stimulating the economy next year \u2014 or not \u2014 could influence the election.\n\nThere has been a lot of debate about Trump\u2019s influence, if any, on the Fed, but perhaps the most powerful argument central bank leaders have been hearing to lower rates has come from people on the front lines of America\u2019s poor and working-class neighborhoods. They have stood up at the Fed Listens events and urged central bankers to do more to boost the economy.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear we\u2019re at full employment, that is not my reality. That is not our community\u2019s reality,\u201d said Juan Salgado, chancellor of City Colleges of Chicago, with 80,000 mostly minority students, at a Fed Listens event in Chicago in early June.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFull unemployment isn\u2019t an exact science, leaving room for debate about when the economy ever reaches this level. The jobless rate is 3.5 percent, a half-century low, but unemployment has shown signs of picking up in some areas where the economy is softening.\n\nSalgado\u2019s words were echoed over and over again. At a Fed Listens event hosted by the Cleveland Fed later in June, Carolyn Valli, executive director of the Central Berkshire Habitat for Humanity, was asked whether she thought the nation was at full employment.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no and no. That is not the experience of low-income folks in our community,\u201d replied Valli as many around her nodded in agreement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a boom yet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDenise Scott, executive vice president for programs at the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, was equally as blunt at the D.C. Fed event in October: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like full employment.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA number of Fed leaders looked surprised at what they were hearing at a time when the official unemployment rate has been under 4 percent for more than a year, and there\u2019s evidence that the remarks have influenced Powell, among other top leaders at the central bank.\n\n\u201cOur challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind,\u201d Powell said in August. He has made similar remarks at almost every public appearance since his June news conference.\n\nAD\n\nIn many ways, what the Fed has been hearing from people around the country has strengthened the case for the U-turn in policy the central bank made this year. Coming into 2019, the Fed planned to raise interest rates to ensure the economy didn\u2019t overheat, but Powell quickly changed course. The central bank paused interest rate hikes in January, then started cutting rates this summer out of concern that the trade war and the weakness overseas would drag the U.S. economy down, too.\n\nAD\n\nCongress gave the Fed two jobs: low unemployment and stable prices. For decades, the Fed has tried to balance the two goals, but since the Great Recession, inflation has not returned. Many models predicted inflation would come back, especially as the economy entered a record-breaking 11th year of growth, but it hasn\u2019t happened, and a big rethink is underway among economists about whether to bias a bit more toward boosting jobs and pay, at least until inflation rises for a sustained period.\n\n\u201cIt really is very important that the labor market remain as tight as possible for as long as possible,\u201d said Rachel Flum, executive director of the Economic Progress Institute at the Boston Fed Listens event in May. \u201cWe really think the benefits of a prolonged, progression, sustained period of tight labor markets outweighs the inflationary costs, especially right now where we haven\u2019t seen those going up\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMyron Frans, commissioner of the Minnesota Management and Budget office, put it this way at a Fed Listens event in Minneapolis in April: \u201cI would sacrifice a little bit of price stability for more employment \u2014 maximum employment \u2014 personally.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Fed has a stated goal to get inflation to 2 percent. It has been running consistently below that level for years, and some Fed leaders want to lower interest rates in an effort to boost inflation. Lowering rates would probably also have the effect of boosting the labor market, because a hotter economy should trigger companies to hire more people to meet demand from customers.\n\nThere is evidence that people who have traditionally struggled to find work are having an easier time now. There has been a surge of Hispanic women joining the labor force and unemployment rates for Hispanics, African Americans and those without college degrees are at or near historic lows. Pay has also been rising quickly for some of the lowest-paid workers, partly because of a tight labor market and partly because many states and cities have increased their minimum wages.\n\nAD\n\nBut many people stressed to the Fed that these Americans who have just gained jobs, including many with criminal records, are often in the most danger of losing employment if the economy falls into a downturn.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that once they\u2019ve been hired they will necessarily stay in that job,\u201d said Andy Van Kleunen, chief executive of the National Skills Coalition, at a Chicago event in June. He also cited issues like transportation and child care that can cause people to have to leave a job if they can\u2019t get those problems addressed.\n\nPowell acknowledged that there is only so much the Fed can do with the tools that it has to address economic problems.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt also feels like there\u2019s a need for policies beyond just keeping interest rates low,\u201d Powell said this month in Kansas City. \u201cIt\u2019s really also about training. It\u2019s about education. It\u2019s about other things that enable people to make a connection with the labor force and stay there. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m hearing and taking away from what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe main lever the Fed has is to move the benchmark interest rate. It is currently sitting at a level that most economists think is about neutral, meaning it neither stimulates nor contracts the economy. Going lower would probably pump up the economy.\n\nOne of the last words Fed leaders heard before they went into a quiet period to prepare for their interest rate decision this week was from Herb Hardwick, founder of Hardwick Law Firm in Kansas City, that does legal work for many housing and commercial real estate projects. He warned that he has starting to prepare for a slowdown.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo guard against the downturn we think will occur in the next 18 months to two years, we\u2019re starting to diversify our business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are starting to see a softening with respect to the development side. Even though money is available for some segments of the community, I think there has been a slowdown.\u201d\n\nRelated:", "description": "The central bank is widely expected to lower interest rates Wednesday \u2014 for the third time this year \u2014 in an effort to prevent the slowing U.S. economy from stalling.", "authors": ["Heather Long", "Economics Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_Yf8OSC5XrXYLf3R6Agt3RYQcPU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3PRZFLXG3QI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
