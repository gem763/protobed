So ultimately you\u2019re going to be able to buy Bitcoin in a regular brokerage account, or it\u2019s going to look like a regular brokerage account. So I\u2019m less concerned that you need a bitcoin ETF at this point in time.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) decision to define Ethereum as a commodity made a significant impact on the space, adding:\n\n\u201cThe CFTC saying that Ethereum is a commodity is huge for the space. It gives us regulatory clarity. [...] That opens the door for institutions to come in. [...] Everybody is concerned, what if they ban it? [...] The CFTC said \u2018we\u2019re not banning it yet, we\u2019re gonna regulate it,\u2019 and now investors can say \u2018Put them in my commodity bucket.\u2019\u201d\n\nGeneral hope for the market\n\nIn May, Kelly has also said that the upcoming supply cut \u2014 brought by the next halving of the block reward \u2014 could help Bitcoin prices rise further in the coming months.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 9, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission rejected Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s proposal to list a Bitcoin ETF.", "description": "Bitcoin ETFs are hardly needed for the ecosystem\u2019s development, says founder and CEO of crypto investment firm BKCM Brian Kelly", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYzUxNGI4YmEzNWIxMmI4ZWVmMmU5OTcwOTI5MDBiNWIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
