What are you doing out here?\"\n\nThe comedian was escorted outside by a woman with the producer, US media reports said, and the bar confirmed in a Facebook post that a \"heckler\" had been asked to leave.\n\nWeinstein's publicist said the mogul was out with friends, and \"trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down\".\n\n\"This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too,\" they said.\n\nWeinstein has been accused of inappropriate behaviour by more than 80 women, and was a catalyst for America's #MeToo movement last year.", "description": "Kelly Bachman booed after protesting Harvey Weinstein's presence at an event for young actors in Manhattan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8361/27273ae9f0c54945b687e37dc105ed15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
