Brent and WTI rose more than 3% last week, their\n\nfirst weekly increase since the week starting Sept. 20, on signs\n\nof progress toward a trade deal that would boost crude demand.\n\nBut optimism that the trade negotiations would prove\n\nsuccessful faded, as China indicated further discussions were\n\nneeded and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the next\n\nround of tariffs on Chinese imports are still set to take effect\n\non Dec. 15 if a deal has not been reached by then. But existing tariffs remain in place and officials on both\n\nsides said much more work was needed before an accord could be\n\nagreed. A good portion of the gains last week came after the United\n\nStates announced on Friday it was deploying more troops to Saudi\n\nArabia, and after an Iranian oil tanker was attacked in the Red\n\nSea.\n\nOil prices had drawn some support from worries that further\n\nescalation along the Syrian and Turkish border could affect\n\noutput or exports from Iraq. Syrian troops entered a\n\nnortheastern town on Monday.\n\nThe Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said\n\noil exporters were showing serious commitment to global output\n\ncuts in a deal between OPEC and its allies, a grouping known as\n\nOPEC+. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said there were no\n\ntalks underway to change the OPEC+ deal.\n\nKuwait's oil minister said it was too early to discuss a\n\npossible buildup in oil inventories in 2020. Khaled al-Fadhel\n\nsaid a price range of $50 to $70 per barrel would be\n\nacceptable. The compliance of OPEC+ producers with the supply-reduction\n\nagreement was seen at above 200% in September, sources familiar\n\nwith the matter said.\n\nBin Salman also said on Monday that Saudi Arabia's oil\n\nproduction will recover in October and November to levels above\n\nthose seen before attacks on its energy installations in\n\nSeptember, which weighed on oil prices.\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC: Iran oil tanker hit by missiles off Saudi coast IMG\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2B4p0iu\n\nGRAPHIC: Call on OPEC crude https://tmsnrt.rs/2OCPCzd\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Additoinal reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin in London,\n\nFlorence Tan and Seng Li Peng; Editing by David Gregorio and\n\nLisa Shumaker)\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 8-Oil falls more than 2% on U.S.-China trade deal doubts, stronger dollar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC2909A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
