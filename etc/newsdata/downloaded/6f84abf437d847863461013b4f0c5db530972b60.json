And he wrapped up his hat-trick after a putting away a brilliant cross from Mahrez.\n\nBut as his teammates point out, Sterling could have indeed netted a fourth after he found himself in the clear, but could only fire wide.\n\nHis manager Guardiola heaped praise on him after the game, calling him an 'extraordinary player' following his scintillating display.", "description": "The England winger was in superb form as City won 5-1 win, but Benjamin Mendy and Riyad Mahrez took the opportunity to tease Sterling, telling him he could have grabbed another goal.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/10/20076482-0-image-a-15_1571823726380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
