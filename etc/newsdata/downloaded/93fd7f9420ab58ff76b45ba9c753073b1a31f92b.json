The programme follows HMS Queen Elizabeth during the first of the flight trials with F35B.\n\nPeter 'Wizzer' Wilson, who has 30 years experience flying in the RAF and the Navy will attempt the first ever ship born vertical landing of the jets on the Queen Elizabeth.\n\nMr Wilson told the BBC: \"This is a moment in history. This is something phenomenal that is about to happen because the capability this will bring for the F-35 to be able to bring back weight to Queen Elizabeth means the military can operate the F-35 in a way that the other forces cannot.\"\n\nIt will air on BBC 2 at 8pm on Sunday night.", "description": "The impressive jets are set to land on the UK's biggest warship in a BBC documentary Sunday night", "authors": ["Grace Witherden", "Image", "Hms Queen Elizabeth"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11228JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
