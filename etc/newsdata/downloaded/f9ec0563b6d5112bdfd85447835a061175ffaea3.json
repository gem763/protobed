Farms in Colorado are plentiful, too. But commercial growers on the East Coast until now have cultivated marijuana in warehouses or greenhouses.\n\nPartly, that\u2019s because the region has been slower to adopt legal marijuana industries. But mostly, it\u2019s because the humid climate and variable temperatures on this side of the country create less-than-ideal conditions for outdoor cannabis.\n\nMd. regulators delay new cannabis licenses amid complaints of unfairness\n\n\u201cYou need six months of hot, dry days with cool nights, which few East Coast places have,\u201d said Michael Wheeler, a vice president with Flow Kana, which works with hundreds of small outdoor marijuana farmers in Northern California.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo diss against indoor, but outdoor is a totally different product,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever experienced the satisfaction of a ripe, sun-grown tomato from a farmers market, then you can appreciate the difference between outdoor grown cannabis and indoor.\u201d\n\nCulta, one of about a dozen legal medical cannabis cultivators in Maryland, mostly grows indoors, in a warehouse that cost more than $10 million and controls the strength of the breezes, the pH of the water, and the wavelengths, duration and intensity of the light.\n\nBut all that effort to artificially replicate ideal growing conditions is also expensive, roughly three times the price of putting irrigated plants in dirt outside. And as the still-new industry rapidly expands, growers can\u2019t borrow from banks to finance their growth, in part because most financial institutions won\u2019t lend to an industry that the federal government still considers illegal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs an alternative way to raise cash, Barch and his investors decided to take their chances, setting up an outdoor operation near their warehouse in a downtown Cambridge industrial area, on land Barch says was once home to a tuna cannery.\n\nIf Culta could grow cannabis outdoors for a third of the price, the company reasoned, it could plow the higher profit margins into more expansion.\n\nAnd as the only outdoor cultivator in Maryland, Culta could theoretically perfect the process and corner the market in \u201csun-grown\u201d cannabis, which is often marketed as organic and sustainable, with a lower carbon footprint.\n\nBanks want a hit of the marijuana business. Will they get to partake?\n\nBut the same way that heirloom tomatoes can vary widely in appearance, \u201csun-grown\u201d cannabis can appear imperfect. Longtime marijuana lawyer and consultant Brian Vincente said that, though outdoor cannabis connoisseurs may beg to differ, \u201cin general, it\u2019s not viewed as much as a high-quality product.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor now, Culta plans to use all of its outdoor harvest for making processed cannabis products, such as dabs, tinctures and vape cartridges, rather than selling the whole flowers for smoking.\n\nMassachusetts also permits large-scale commercial, outdoor cultivation. But none of the four companies approved to grow outdoors in Massachusetts have begun operations, regulators there said.\n\nIn Maryland, outdoor cultivation is effectively banned in some places by local zoning laws that regulate the scent emitted by cannabis plants. Other states have imposed restrictions because of safety concerns.\n\nVincente, whose Colorado-based cannabis law firm represents thousands of clients across the country, said those limits could ease as marijuana markets mature. When consumers become more interested in the benefits of outdoor cannabis \u2014 price and otherwise \u2014 he said, regulators tend to follow suit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of rule of thumb that when marijuana first becomes legal, it gets regulated like plutonium,\u201d Vincente said. \u201cMost states don\u2019t begin by allowing outdoor cultivation.\u201d\n\nFor Culta\u2019s experiment, Barch had to clear four inches of soil across three acres, much of it contaminated in the 1989 Cambridge Butter Fire, a multiday grease inferno in a nearby warehouse that had stockpiled 750 tons of butter, along with what news reports described as \u201cmillions of pounds of pork ribs, Butterball turkeys, hot dogs, crab cakes, eel and mackerel.\u201d\n\nThe company then brought in dump trucks of full of dirt to raise the entire area by 18 inches, enough to keep most of the plants\u2019 root systems out of the local water table.\n\nAD\n\nOklahoma approves one of the country\u2019s most expansive medical pot bills\n\nIn late July, work crews planted a little under an acre with hundreds of different types of marijuana plants, each plant worth several thousand dollars. As they grow, workers manicure the plants, altering their natural Christmas-tree shape into something that resembles a crepe myrtle \u2014 an upward and outward spreading plant, heavy with flowers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo the inexperienced eye, these all look like big, smelly marijuana plants. But if you look at them for a while, you can tell how different they are,\u201d said Dave Myrowitz, Culta\u2019s outdoor cultivation manager.\n\nHe pointed out a spindly, light-green plant, then a squat, deep-green one with purple veins in its flower. One plant smelled like powered orange Gatorade, another like a grape Fruit Roll-Up, and another gave off an aroma that smelled a little like cookies.\n\nWith a pair of garden shears, Myrowitz clipped two-foot long, flowering marijuana shafts, known as colas, and dropped them into a blue plastic bin. A team of 12 seasonal workers was waiting to strip the buds, which would then either be flash-frozen or cured like tobacco, depending on what the on-site processing lab hopes to use them for.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company harvests its indoor crop every three weeks. But the outdoor field is 20 times larger and requires the temporary workers to help make sure the plants get out of the ground and preserved quickly.\n\nThe fact that there\u2019s so much to preserve is partly a matter of luck. This year\u2019s hot summer, which ended with a drought, helped concentrate desirable marijuana compounds. A constant light breeze off the nearby Choptank River helped stave off mold, and there were no battles with unexpected pests \u2014 except for one panicked afternoon, when someone discovered an invasive caterpillar.\n\nWhy Maryland\u2019s marijuana growers are adding more plants\n\nCulta\u2019s cultivators are not only looking for a plant that grows well in this climate. They\u2019re also \u201cpheno-hunting,\u201d which is what cannabis cultivators call the process of identifying a plant that expresses just the right traits (phenotype) to make it a superstar among consumers. Roughly 90 percent of what was planted this year won\u2019t be tried again, because the cultivators have deemed those varieties either not hardy enough or distinct enough.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe other 10 percent will be cloned and replanted in bulk alongside more experiments, as cultivators search for a plant that produces the right amount of THC \u2014 the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana \u2014 and has a nice variety of terpenes, the oily compounds that give each plant a distinct smell and flavor.\n\nIndustry experts said the longer growing season for outdoor cannabis allows the plants to develop and ripen more terpenes, another variable for experimentation that wouldn\u2019t be practical inside a warehouse.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to experiment without hurting our production\u201d indoors, Myrowitz said. But outside, \u201cyou can also go and find your gem.\u201d\n\nD.C. mansion that once held loud parties now a marijuana pop-up, police say\n\nMaryland Rep.
