Now the fight over millions of unpaid dollars will likely get only nastier moving forward.\n\n\n\nWith nearly all of Brown\u2019s $15 million contract expected to be withheld following his release from the Patriots, a league source told Yahoo Sports the wide receiver will ask the NFL Players Association to file a grievance on his behalf in the coming days \u2014 with the intent of securing nearly $10 million in unpaid salary and guarantees from New England. That effort promises to lead into a suddenly very personal arbitration battle between the Patriots and Brown, after the wideout indicated that he not only expects his union to fight for him, but also took a shot at team owner Robert Kraft in a Sunday morning Twitter storm.\n\nAntonio Brown, pictured with his agent Drew Rosenhaus in Week 2, came out firing on Twitter on Sunday, notably criticizing Patriots owner Robert Kraft. (USA TODAY Sports)\n\nIn one post, Brown tweeted a reference to Kraft\u2019s still-unresolved prostitution case, stating \u201cKraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly.\u201d The message included a photo of Brown with former trainer Britney Taylor, who filed a civil lawsuit earlier this month alleging the wideout raped and sexually assaulted her. Conversely, Kraft is still beneath the cloud of unresolved misdemeanor solicitation charges, stemming from a police sting of a Florida spa last February.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nWill not be playing in the @NFL anymore these owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the @NFLPA hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up ! \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nBrown\u2019s cannon shot at Kraft comes after the Patriots released Brown and apparently alerted his representation that the team would not pay him anything beyond two game checks totaling $158,333. While Brown appeared on the field in only Week 2 for the Patriots, he practiced the majority of Week 3 before his release on Friday. A source told Yahoo Sports that while Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick jointly made the decision to release Brown, Kraft was \u201cdone\u201d with the receiver after Sports Illustrated detailed a series of intimidating group text messages Brown allegedly sent to a second woman who had accused him of inappropriate behavior while she was painting a mural in his home in 2017.\n\n\n\nThose text messages could end up being a significant point of contention for the Patriots as they seek to withhold nearly $9 million in signing bonus money and nearly $717,000 in remaining salary guarantees. With the union expected to fight for Brown\u2019s collection of that money, New England will eventually be forced to make a case before an arbitrator that Brown violated the relevant voiding triggers in contract. A league source told Yahoo Sports those triggers could include:\n\nStandard NFL contract language in which a player must notify a team of any pending actionable issues against him prior to signing his deal. While Yahoo Sports hasn\u2019t seen this language in Brown\u2019s deal, a league source said such an entry is a \u201cboilerplate\u201d protection used by all teams and looms large in situations where legal cases arise from past behavior. Essentially, the language states that the player represents and warrants that he has not engaged and will not engage in illegal activity that would impact his availability to the team.\n\nA \u201cdisparagement\u201d clause that undermines the image of the Patriots. Yahoo Sports was sent that language from Brown\u2019s now-void contract with New England, which stated, \u201cIf at any time prior to the end of the 2019 League Year, [Brown]: \u2026 takes any action that materially undermines the public\u2019s respect for, or is materially critical of, the Club, Player\u2019s teammates or the Club\u2019s ownership, coaches, management, operations or policies then, upon election of the Club, the guarantees set forth in this section 27 will be null and void, whether or not any such guarantee otherwise had been earned in accordance with the terms thereof.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe arbitration argument of these points will be paramount. And the Patriots may have a significant fight on their hands proving Brown triggered any voiding language.\n\n\n\nFor example, if the Patriots argue that Brown or his representation should have told the team about settlement negotiations prior to the civil lawsuit filed in federal court, the union could counter with the fact that New England kept Brown on the roster (and played him in a game) after that lawsuit came to light. In effect, the NFLPA could argue that by playing Brown against the Miami Dolphins in Week 2 (after the civil suit was filed), the Patriots voided any claims of damage they had stemming from Brown and his representation failing to alert New England about a potential civil suit.\n\n\n\nAs for the disparagement clause, the Patriots may have some traction arguing that Brown took \u201caction that materially undermine[d] the image\u201d of the team. That traction would be in the form of Brown allegedly sending the \u201cthreatening\u201d group text messages to the woman who was a subject in the Sports Illustrated report. Since New England cut Brown after those reported texts \u2014 and since the texts occurred while he was under contract \u2014 the team might have an argument that SI\u2019s ensuing story damaged the team\u2019s image after it stood by him following the civil suit and initial report of sexual misconduct by Sports Illustrated.\n\nBill Belichick and Robert Kraft are still dealing with the aftermath of Antonio Brown's 11-day employment. (Getty Images)\n\nInterestingly, what New England can\u2019t claim is that Brown was \u201cmaterially critical\u201d of Kraft with his latest tweet. Why? Because Brown\u2019s tweet about Kraft\u2019s pending misdemeanor prostitution charges came after his contract had been canceled by the Patriots. With no contract in place, Brown is now free to disparage New England\u2019s ownership or anyone else associated with the team to his heart\u2019s content.\n\n\n\nThe flip side to that approach on social media \u2014 including the tweet that Brown already aimed toward Kraft \u2014 is that it will likely galvanize the Patriots\u2019 stance that he isn\u2019t owed another dime by the team. If the New England owner was already \u201cdone\u201d with Brown prior to Sunday, his animus toward the wideout likely wasn\u2019t lessened by a social media post comparing Brown\u2019s rape and sexual assault allegations in civil court to Kraft\u2019s misdemeanor prostitution solicitation charges in criminal court.\n\n\n\nWhatever the emotions are at this stage, one fact remains: money speaks the loudest. The Patriots don\u2019t appear willing to give Brown another penny beyond what he has already been paid, and Brown is insistent the team owes him nearly $10 million total for his 11 days on the roster.\n\n\n\nUltimately, it will be an arbitrator and lawyers who hash out which party is correct. Until that happens, the freight train of hurt feelings is bound to chug on, taking this very brief relationship to some personal lows that nobody could have expected only two weeks ago.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "With nearly all of Brown\u2019s $15M contract expected to be withheld, a source told Yahoo Sports the WR will ask the NFLPA to file a grievance on his behalf.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e5mow2OM9yhdEDWQjo4c4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ULQMeWuG1LhwB9uE6xG89g--~B/aD0yNjg5O3c9NDAzMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b2e88d30-dd83-11e9-afb7-60024e07cb6d", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
