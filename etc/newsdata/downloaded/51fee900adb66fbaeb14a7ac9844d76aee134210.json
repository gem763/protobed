REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - The Beatles\u2019 \u201cAbbey Road\u201d album has returned to the top of the British album charts 50 years after its first release.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that Abbey Road still holds up after all these years. But then again it\u2019s a bloody cool album,\u201d former Beatle Paul McCartney said in a press release.\n\nFeaturing such songs as \u201cSomething\u201d and \u201cCome Together\u201d, \u201cAbbey Road\u201d was the second-last album released by the Beatles before their acrimonious split, although most of their final release, \u201cLet it Be\u201d, was recorded before the \u201cAbbey Road\u201d sessions.\n\nIts initial 17-week run at number one ended on Jan. 31, 1970, and it returns to the top of the charts after a gap of 49 years and 252 days, a feat certified as a Guinness World Record.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of \u201cAbbey Road\u201d was marked last month by the release of special deluxe edition.", "description": "The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" album has returned to the top of the British album charts 50 years after its first release.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437101835&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931D7", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
