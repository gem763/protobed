(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Redskins again practiced Thursday without defensive lineman Jonathan Allen and tight end Jordan Reed, leading to a concern that both key contributors might not be able to play Monday night against the Chicago Bears.\n\nAllen, who sprained his knee in the season-opening defeat at the Philadelphia Eagles, missed last week\u2019s loss the Dallas Cowboys. But Coach Jay Gruden had expressed hope that Allen, who practiced some Wednesday, would be able to fully practice this week. Instead, he missed Thursday\u2019s practice completely.\n\n\u201cHe had a significant injury,\u201d Gruden said, \u201cso we\u2019re just making sure he\u2019s going to be okay before he starts individual drills and practice. We thought another day for him would be more beneficial for him.\u201d\n\n[Tony Wyllie, Redskins' head of communications, is leaving the organization]\n\nReed\u2019s status is more uncertain as he recovers from a concussion suffered in the team\u2019s third preseason game. He has done individual work in practices, including Wednesday\u2019s, but has yet to be cleared for full practices or a game.\n\nAlso not practicing Thursday were cornerback Quinton Dunbar (knee), quarterback Colt McCoy (leg) and linebacker Cassanova McKinzy (hip). Right tackle Morgan Moses, who is dealing with a sore knee, and cornerback Fabian Moreau, who has missed both games this season with an ankle injury, were limited Thursday.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nJenkins: Case Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big\n\nFor the Redskins, 0-3 would mean doom.
