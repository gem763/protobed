But that has crashed down to \u00a36.2billion, and it is battling to survive.\n\nThis extraordinary drop, just like We Work's rise, has been inextricably linked to Neumann.\n\nAs the company's hard-partying and unorthodox chief executive, he helped it grow from a tiny New York start-up to a global behemoth with 15,000 staff and offices in 123 cities.\n\nNeumann, pictured with wife Rebekah, had the reputation of a hard-partying and unorthodox chief executive\n\nIt soon became known for its aggressive expansion, trendy locations and, famously, free beer on its premises for customers.\n\nIt aimed to 'elevate the world's consciousness' \u2013 echoing the culture of many of Silicon Valley's flashiest firms.\n\nSuch was Neumann's influence that when the company published its stock market prospectus, the risk of him leaving was listed as a 'material adverse effect on our business'.\n\nBut as more and more gaffes emerged during the flotation process, investors began to worry about the former chief executive for very different reasons.\n\nConcerns emerged about its widening \u00a31.5billion losses, Neumann's control over some properties that We Work rented and his tight grip on the company via an unusual share structure.\n\nReports he had sold the 'We' trademark to his firm for \u00a34.6million and allegedly used drugs on company premises also unnerved potential backers.\n\nWe Work had to call off the float, with Neumann ousted as chief executive by Softbank which at that stage owned one- third of shares.\n\nHe will now exit the company almost entirely and Softbank's Marcelo Claure will be tasked, as the new chairman, with halting We Work's rapid decline.\n\nAnalysts have said that We Work's tumbling fortunes are partly a result of the mystique that surrounded it \u2013 despite the fact that it is essentially a property company.\n\nJohn Colley, of Warwick Business School, previously noted it had 'slick marketing' but was losing money hand over fist. He said: 'Fundamentally, We Work finances do not look good.'\n\nWe Work did not respond to requests for comment last night, and Softbank also declined to comment.", "description": "The deal proposed by Softbank will reportedly see the Japanese investor buy roughly \u00a3775m of shares from Adam Neumann, giving it majority control of the business.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
