Two weeks later, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (DKS), the biggest sporting goods retailer in the country, completely stopped selling guns to customers younger than 21 and removed assault rifles and high-capacity magazines from all of its stores.\n\n\u201cIf you see a problem and you have an expertise on the problem and you have a sense of the solution, you should stand up and say something and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods CEO and Chairman Ed Stack told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\nThe company actually tried to ban assault rifles back in 2012 after the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting. But after customer backlash, they put the guns back on the shelves at its Field & Stream stores, some of which the company has sold.\n\nThe Parkland shooting was a turning point for Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods \u201cWe sold a shotgun to the Parkland shooter in November 2017,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt was not the gun, nor the type of gun, he used in the shooting\u2014 but it could have been.\u201d\n\nIn April 2018, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, said it planned to destroy all military-style rifles it took off its shelves after the shooting rather than allowing them to sell at another retailer. Since then, the company destroyed $5 million worth of its gun inventory and turned it into scrap metal. Stack also said the new restrictions on guns will cost the company about a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue. For the fiscal year ending Feb. 2, 2019, same-store sales fell 3.1%, according to company earnings, and Stack blamed a lot of it on gun issues.\n\nThe entrance to the Dick's Sporting Goods store is seen in Glendale, California on February 28, 2018. Dick's, one of the nation's largest sports retailers, said February 28 that it was immediately ending sales of all assault-style rifles in its stores. The retailer also said that it would no longer sell high-capacity magazines and that it would not sell any gun to anyone under 21 years of age, regardless of local laws. / AFP PHOTO / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\nStack is among the 144 corporate executives that signed a letter urging Congress to expand background checks and issue stronger gun control laws in September.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to encourage Congress to solve this problem,\u201d Stack said. \u201cWe knew there would be some blowback.\u201d\n\nSince the move by Dick\u2019s, in September Walmart announced that it would reduce gun and ammunition sales and request that customers no longer open carry guns into their stores.\n\nValentina Caval is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack explains his decision to restrict gun sales at the company.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UOflAUTrWQ1N2VlxV1aPNw--~B/aD0zNDkxO3c9NTEyNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b7e603d0-ea0d-11e9-b7fe-551e3cd6e238", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
