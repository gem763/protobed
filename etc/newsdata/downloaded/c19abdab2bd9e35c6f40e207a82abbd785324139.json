They hope to meet in person later this week,' Downing Street said.\n\nIrish leader Leo Varadkar (pictured right cycling with Danish PM Mette Frederiksen) left Boris Johnson's plans for a Brexit deal in tatters by reneging on a secret compromise over Northern Ireland, it has been claimed\n\nMr Johnson (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) spoke to Leo Varadkar in a 40-minute call yesterday and the two leaders are expected to meet face-to-face later this week\n\nYesterday Mr Varadkar said Ireland and the EU would not accept an agreement at 'any cost'.\n\n'There are some fundamental objectives that haven't changed for the past three years and we need them guaranteed,' he told RTE news.\n\n'I think it is going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly.\n\n'Essentially what the United Kingdom has done is repudiate the deal that we negotiated in good faith with Prime Minister May's government over two years and sort of put half of that now back on the table and are saying, 'That's a concession'. And of course it isn't really.'\n\nEarlier an extraordinary public slanging match broke out following a series of No 10 briefings claiming German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made clear a deal was now 'overwhelmingly unlikely'.\n\nNumber 10 sources said Mrs Merkel told the PM during a stormy 30-minute call that the province must remain within the EU's customs union indefinitely.\n\nBut Mr Johnson retorted that her position meant a deal was 'essentially impossible, not just now but ever'.\n\nA Downing Street source said the call - which effectively reads the last rites on hopes for an agreement before next week's EU summit - was a 'clarifying moment'.\n\n'If this represents a new established position then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but ever,' the No10 source said.\n\n'It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement.'\n\nIn response, EU council president Donald Tusk ranted on Twitter that the PM was risking the 'security and interests of our people' by refusing to make concessions.\n\nThe PM's spokesman swiped back that he had 'chosen to conduct these talks by personal telephone conversations with EU leaders, so I will refrain from commenting on social media.'\n\nJean-Claude Juncker said that if negotiations fail, 'the explanation will be found in the British camp, adding: 'The original sin is found on the islands and not on the continent'.\n\nMr Johnson met his Cabinet for crisis talks after the conversation yesterday morning.\n\nThe PM also hosted European Parliament president David Sassoli in Downing Street on Tuesday, but the MEP left saying 'no progress' had been made.\n\nThe meltdown with the EU appears to have been carefully choreographed, with Brexit minister Michael Gove unveiling a 'preparedness' paper on No Deal shortly after the Merkel bust-up emerged.\n\nLast night Parliament was prorogued - for real this time - ahead of a Queen's Speech next week.\n\nDowning Street had already painted a grim picture of the consequences of rejecting the UK's 'fair and reasonable' blueprint.\n\nOne source - claimed to be maverick strategist Dominic Cummings - explosively claimed that the government will make clear that any EU country supporting a delay to the October 31 Brexit deadline would be engaging in 'hostile interference' in British politics.\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured visiting a hospital in Watford yesterday) is holding a crisis meeting as aides admit the Brexit talks are set to break down dramatically this week\n\nIn a crunch moment for negotiations, the PM and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured right in Berlin yesterday) clashed brutally in an early morning phone call. Donald Tusk (left) then accused Mr Johnson of a 'stupid blame game'\n\nEU council president Donald Tusk ranted on Twitter that the PM was risking the 'security and interests of our people' by refusing to make concessions\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss were among the ministers gathering in Downing Street today\n\nFormer Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed maverick No10 aide Dominic Cummings (pictured in Downing Street last week) was behind the explosive briefing\n\nAs the situation threatened to spiral out of control, DUP leader Arlene Foster raged: 'The comments from the German Chancellor to the Prime Minister that Northern Ireland must remain in the EU Customs Union forever now reveal the real objective of Dublin and the European Union.\n\nWhat happens next in the Brexit crisis? Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: October 14: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels, but Mr Johnson now seems certain to boycott the event in protest at the bloc's intransigence. October 19: If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will only let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. If there is a deal, it will start being rushed through Parliament immediately. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU. November/December: An election looks inevitable.\n\n'For the United Kingdom to be asked to leave a part of its sovereign territory in a foreign organisation of which the UK would no longer be a part and over which we would have no say whatsoever is beyond crazy. No UK Government could ever concede such a surrender.\n\n'The EU is not interested in a negotiated outcome at this time. Their position is the UK can only leave with a deal if it agrees a binding piece of international law permanently tying either the whole country or a part of it to the EU's legal order over which it has no control.\n\n'The true purpose of the \"backstop\" is now in the open for an to see. Those who eagerly supported the backstop as the best of both worlds can now see the error of that assessment. It was neither temporary nor an insurance policy.'\n\nNigel Farage tweeted: 'The EU were never going to negotiate in good faith. We simply have to leave with a clean break.'\n\nBut shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the government was trying to 'sabotage' the talks.\n\n'This is yet another cynical attempt by No 10 to sabotage the negotiations,' he said.\n\n'Boris Johnson will never take responsibility for his own failure to put forward a credible deal. His strategy from day one has been for a no-deal Brexit.\n\n'It is now more important than ever that parliament unites to prevent this reckless government crashing us out of the EU at the end of the month.'\n\nWhile technical talks between officials continued yesterday, EU leaders have so far refused to hold face-to-face talks with Mr Johnson on his plan for replacing the controversial Irish backstop.\n\nMr Johnson needs a deal sorted by the end of October 17/18 if he is to avoid a dilemma over the Benn Act, which compels him to ask Brussels for an extension if he cannot get an agreement past MPs when he returns, a move he has ruled out taking.\n\nWhy is the EU's Northern Ireland customs union demand so problematic? Angela Merkel reportedly told Boris Johnson yesterday morning that there could only be a Brexit deal if the UK agreed that Northern Ireland will permanently stay in the EU's customs union. Ms Merkel apparently said that if Britain could not agree to that then a deal was 'overwhelmingly unlikely'. Meanwhile, a Number 10 source said that if that was the EU's negotiating red line then a deal is 'essentially impossible'. The reason the customs demand is so significant, and potentially deal-wrecking, is that it would effectively mean Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK forever. Under the plan put forward by Mr Johnson, Northern Ireland would stay in the EU's single market for goods but would leave the customs union at the same time as the rest of Britain. That would enable the province to benefit from any future UK trade deals. If it was kept in the customs union while the rest of the UK left, then it would be excluded from those trade deals. As a result, critics would argue that keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union would leave it out in the cold and isolated - technically still a part of the UK but on a very different path. That is why Mr Johnson - or any other UK PM - would struggle to agree to such a proposal. It would also prompt fury from Unionist politicians who are adamant that Ulster must not be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Labour's Brexit plan would see the whole of the UK in a customs union with the EU and so the question of treating Northern Ireland differently would not arise.\n\nThe PM said yesterday that Brussels had been presented with 'a big step forward, big advance, big compromise by the UK Government', but complained the EU was not engaging with the details.\n\nAnd in an incendiary briefing, a No10 source told the Spectator: 'They think now that if there is another delay we will keep coming back with new proposals.\n\n'This won't happen. We'll either leave with No Deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with No Deal.'\n\nThe brutal assault - which former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd claimed came from Mr Cummings - emerged after Mr Johnson's proposals hit a huge roadblock.\n\nEU politicians have branded them a 'joke' and Emmanuel Macron set a deadline of Friday for the UK to make more concessions.\n\nUpping the ante yesterday, Mr Tusk tweeted directly at Mr Johnson, saying: 'What's at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.\n\n'At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.\n\n'You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?'\n\nIrish deputy PM Simon Coveney also waded into the row, saying: 'Hard to disagree - reflects the frustration across EU and the enormity of what's at stake for us all. We remain open to finalize a fair Brexit deal but need a UK Govt willing to work with EU to get it done.'\n\nAsked if the PM was playing a 'blame game', the PM's spokesman shot back: 'Absolutely not. It is not us talking in that language.'\n\nThe briefing around the call caused anger in some circles, with claims it misrepresented Mrs Merkel's typically diplomatic approach.\n\nBut government sources flatly denied the exchanges had been 'made up'.\n\nIt is understood Mr Johnson initially asked for the German Chancellor's 'help' with Michel Barnier because he was 'not negotiating' with the UK.\n\nMrs Merkel 'let the cat out of the bag' by making clear that Northern Ireland in the customs union was a red line, at which point Mr Johnson insisted that was 'not going to be accepted'.\n\nThe source said Mrs Merkel 'did not mean it in an aggressive way', but her words had put the EU's stance into sharp focus.\n\nIrish PM Leo Varadkar and EU negotiator Michel Barnier have given short shrift to the UK's Brexit blueprint\n\nA survey conducted by ComRes showed 83 per cent of voters would blame Parliament if Brexit is delayed beyond October 31\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom and housing minister Esther McVey were at the Cabinet meeting in No10 yesterday", "description": "A Number 10 source said Leo Varadkar had agreed to soften his position on Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union if Mr Johnson agreed to keep the province in the single market.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor", "Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor", "David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent", "Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/00/19467776-0-image-a-5_1570578009853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
