Photo: HBO\n\nWarning: The following post contains spoilers for HBO\u2019s Succession but also some helpful tips on how to look good in high-waisted pants, so I guess you should weigh which one is more important to you?\n\nHBO\u2019s Succession is a show about media mogul Logan Roy trying to decide which of his terrible large adult children will take over his empire once his organs harden into gold (I think that\u2019s how the megawealthy die). Will it be the narrow-shouldered manslaughterer Kendall? Greasy-haired necro-troll Roman? Libertarian failson Connor? For a second, it looked like it might be the ethically nonmonogamous Bernie bro, Shiv, until she imploded this week under the force of Cherry Jones\u2019s steely gaze. While none of these options inspire particular confidence, one figure has emerged this season as being far and away the most competent, inspired, and qualified individual to take over Waystar Royco. I\u2019m talking about Shiv Roy\u2019s pants.\n\nShiv\u2019s pants are more thoughtful, capable, and sexually well-adjusted than any of Logan Roy\u2019s children. Their high waists, wide legs, and perfect tailoring demand attention and respect and intentionally so; according to the show\u2019s head costume designer, Michelle Matland, the look is meant to signify her desire \u201cto be seen as an equal in the board room.\u201d Indeed, these are pants that could single-handedly orchestrate a hostile company takeover or convince you of the merits of a media monopoly. For them, I would happily be a boar on the floor.\n\nThe higher the waist, the closer to God. Photo: HBO\n\nThe pants, Matland explained over the phone, show how Shiv has gone from distancing herself from her family\u2019s name and work to increasingly embracing it. \u201cIn the first season, she was wearing sort of tighter pants. The colors, the tones, were much lighter. Before, she wanted to not identify herself as a Roy. She wanted to be Shiv, who was going to work with Gil, and do her own thing.\u201d\n\nIn the second season, however, with the possibility of taking over the company being dangled in front of her by her father like an emotionally toxic carrot, Shiv\u2019s look becomes more masculine, more timeless \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a much more 1930s, the Katherine Hepburn\u2013Greta Garbo\u2013type thing.\u201d Whereas on season one Shiv wore a lot of Theory, this season her wardrobe consists of Hobbs, Armani, Gabriella Hearst, and some Ralph Lauren.\n\n\u201cIn my backstory, because she grew up with all these brothers in this world of competition, she has a lot of tomboy in her,\u201d says Matland. \u201d\ufeffShe\u2019s not interested in being flashy. She wants to be able to fit in with the men. She really wants to meld in but still keep her power.\u201d\n\nBoar on the floor! Boar on the floor! Photo: HBO\n\nMatland also notes that while Shiv\u2019s pants are more stereotypically masculine, \u201cthey\u2019re still incredibly sexy on her because she\u2019s got such an incredible figure.\u201d But could laypeople \u2014 say, bloggers with figures that could best be described as \u201cidentifiably human\u201d \u2014 also pull off the style without looking like small children who snuck into their parents\u2019 closets?\n\nThe key when wearing high-waisted, wide-legged pants, Matland says, is to pair them with a simple top, like one of Shiv\u2019s turtlenecks. That way, \u201cthe pants become the piece that you look at.\u201d\n\nWhile things don\u2019t seem to be looking good for Shiv right now, maybe Logan will finally see the light, that her pants are the only logical successor to take over Waystar Royco. I mean, who else is it gonna be? Connor\u2019s vests?\n\nStay in touch.
