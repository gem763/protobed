Ms. Howard, Raphael De Niro, Matt DeGroot and Maggie Leigh Marshall of Douglas Elliman, in association with Billy Rose and Natasha Barrett of The Agency, have the listing.\n\n\n\nThe building, Hubert Condominiums, owns the air rights above the one-story building directly behind it, so the townhouse gets direct sunlight through its 20-foot-tall floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nMore: Historic Manhattan Townhouse Hitting Market for $12.5M\n\nKenneth Chen for Evan Joseph Studios\n\nThe townhouse comprises five bedrooms and six bathrooms as well as an \u201cepic man cave,\u201d Mr. Davies said, adding that he coined the term in his ESPN soccer column, which ran from 2002 until it was turned into the ESPN soccer podcast \u201cMen in Blazers\u201d in 2011.\n\n\n\nMr. Davies is also known for his work as a television producer on \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\u201d \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee,\u201d ESPN's \u201c2 Minute Drill,\u201d and the U.S. version of \u201cWho Wants to be a Millionaire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 6,500-square-foot home also features a one-car attached garage, a private roof terrace back garden, a library/screening room and elevator access. The expansive master bedroom includes a walk-in closet and en-suite marbled bathroom. One of the things that makes it particularly unique, Mr. Davies said, is that it is a townhouse serviced by a 24-hour doorman and porters.\n\nMore: Four-Bedroom Brooklyn Penthouse to List for $7.5 Million\n\nMr. Davies moved into the house in 2008, according to Ms. Howard, and has made updates and renovations over the years, including repolishing the floors, repainting the walls, and updating the appliances within the last year, Mr. Davies said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing I will never forget is bringing back my daughter, Ingrid,\u201d who was 18 months old at the time, Mr. Davies said. \u201cThat was one of my first ever memories in that house.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Davies said that the townhouse has been a family home for him, helping raise three children: a 14- and 15-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy. \u201cBut there have been some great parties there as well,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Porsche Unveils its First All-Electric Car\n\nMr. Davies said his family is grown up and his career has brought him more to the West Coast, where he recently purchased a home in West Hollywood right behind Chateau Marmont that he has been eyeing for some time.\n\nHe also owns a home in Bridgehampton, New York, and there is no reason to own three large properties, he added.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mr. Davies said he is sad to say goodbye to Tribeca, an area well-known for its art, food and colorful culture, as well as its charming cobblestone streets and architecture, there is one gripe: \u201cThe models and photographers taking photographs in the perfect light on Collister Street,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nuisance I\u2019ll take.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-104861?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
