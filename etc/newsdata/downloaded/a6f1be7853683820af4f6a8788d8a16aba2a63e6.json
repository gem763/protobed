Like, \u2018Yeah, you want to get into this magazine?\u2019 And he pulled his dick out. I was so fucking mad.\n\nWhile the short clip doesn\u2019t reveal the photographer\u2019s name or the magazine in question, or even when the alleged incident took place, Cardi B does tell Martinez that there were zero repercussions afterwards, even though she spoke up about it.\n\nYou know what\u2019s so crazy? I told the magazine owner and he just looked at me like, So? And?\u2019 When I see the #MeToo movement, there\u2019s girls from the \u2018hood, I know they went through the same type of treatment. \u2026 It happens really every day.\n\nWhen interviewer Martinez asks if she\u2019s run into similar behaviour since, Cardi B replies with \u201cOh hell no. I\u2019ll put you on blast on my Instagram.\u201d\n\nHelp is available. If you require immediate assistance, please call 000.
