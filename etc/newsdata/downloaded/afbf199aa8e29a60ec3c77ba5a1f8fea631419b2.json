Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nThe prolific Theresa Rebeck has followed up her Broadway show Bernhardt/Hamlet with an easily consumable dramedy, Seared, rather in the same way one might follow a heavy meat course with a light dessert. The shows do share some ingredients: Both were directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, and both deal with a temperamental artist feeling unappreciated and resistant to criticism. In the first, it was the fin de si\u00e8cle French actress Sarah Bernhardt; in Seared it\u2019s a Park Slope chef called Harry (Ra\u00fal Esparza) who has tattoos and a signature scallop dish. But despite that classic Rebeck tang\u2014a readiness to rise to insults and to have arguments that turn suddenly into airy pronouncements about reality\u2014Seared is actually quite a modest effort, content to be a forgettable little treat. It\u2019s repetitive and a tad empty, but what\u2019s the harm? Some people have arguments, farce breaks out, someone tells a man that he\u2019s got an overblown sense of his own genius. Bake that thing for 120 minutes, and it\u2019ll work for a lot of people\u2019s tastes.\n\nWhen we meet Harry, he\u2019s whizzing around a small restaurant kitchen. Esparza gets to use some of his musical-showman\u2019s grace here, spinning from fridge to working stove (Tim Mackabee designed the detailed set), and sliding tasty-looking things from pan to plate. Waiter Rodney (W. Tr\u00e9 Davis) catches the plates as soon as Harry can whiz them across the service shelf; Mike (David Mason) hasn\u2019t quite got their rhythm, but he is the restaurant\u2019s sole investor/owner/punching bag, so they let it slide. Mike and Harry are in a perpetual fight, the current stanza of which is that Harry won\u2019t make his scallops because someone from New York Magazine said they were good, and he has a hang-up about praise. (Hi! I am now waving at the mention of New York from inside New York! And they said postmodernism was dead.)\n\nThe men seem to be at a stalemate, when in waltzes Emily (Krysta Rodriguez), a restaurant consultant in Blue Fairy mode. She wants to upgrade their scrappy three-man joint, to bring fame and attention and sponsorship deals, to introduce them to wealth beyond their imaginings. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cSo she hires a sous-chef,\u201d you are wrong. Instead she seductively writhes around Harry and brings everyone to total chaotic breakdown: The snake of Capitalism in the garden of Great Food. \u201cMoney isn\u2019t real! Food is real!\u201d cries Harry, at his most pressed, which you\u2019ll note is a silly thing to say. Everyone tells him that he can talk as well as he can cook, which I fervently hope is meant to be ironic.\n\nRebeck whisks in a lot of egg-white lightness, mostly made of that Hollywood disregard for how work actually works. Don\u2019t trouble your cute little noggin over the particulars of Emily\u2019s not-really-a-job (she can call in a New York Times restaurant review as a favor, but she mostly works on spec). Reality isn\u2019t the mission here. If it were, our sexy bad-boy chef wouldn\u2019t be devising a sparkling new entr\u00e9e at the top of Act Two that is\u2014drumroll, gastronomes\u2014salmon with a side of asparagus. Instead, we\u2019re inside a delivery system, one that gets us from one big debate to the next. And I\u2019ll say, I admire Rebeck\u2019s machine-building capabilities without necessarily enjoying them myself. There\u2019s no doubt that she knows exactly how to ramp up the shouting and plating, how to pepper every exchange heavily with conflict. She and Stuelpnagel are a good match in the physical-comedy department; both are good at seasoning a show with door-swinging farce, an energy that keeps the action moving when more serious things (characterization, logic) flag.\n\nAnother prominent flavor here is rom-com. When did we last have a brash lady consultant come in wearing spiky heels, flirting her brains out, coaxing hapless boy-men into financial success? Ren\u00e9e Zellweger did it in New In Town; there was Drew Barrymore circa Fever Pitch; I want to say J. Lo had a whole \u201csexy consultant\u201d period. And Rodriguez knows exactly what genre she\u2019s in. She pivots sharply on her pumps, and exaggerates everything\u2019s she\u2019s doing as though the coverage camera might miss it. She seems to relish playing the plum role: Emily gets to issue the trademark Rebeck men-are-pampered-babies put-down. The others are playing at a slightly smaller size, and so the machine grinds them up a little bit. Even Esparza\u2014who shouts a lot and throws a naughty Salt Bae pose during a silent scene\u2014tries to give us a bit of acting at the end. He subsides into a soberer, sadder, realer mode, and while he\u2019s good at it, it has nothing to do with Seared. After two hours of pot-banging, we weren\u2019t there for sober or sad or real. Those particular dishes had dropped completely off the menu.\n\nSeared is at MCC Theater through December 1.", "description": "Theater Review: Theresa Rebeck\u2019s Play \u2018Seared\u2019 Starring Ra\u00fal Esparza at MCC Is a Pretty Light Restaurant Meal", "authors": ["Helen Shaw"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/28-Seared-Play.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
