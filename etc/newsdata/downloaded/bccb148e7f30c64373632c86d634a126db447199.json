In a new series, we\u2019re focusing on one story at a time, honoring the many different ways babies come into the world and the beauty of every family\u2019s story.\n\nThis week, we\u2019re hearing from Sara Peach, 36, a second-time mom who hired Denver-based birth photographer Monet Nicole to shoot her birth.\n\nIn her own words, Peach describes what birth was like the second time around.\n\nI was induced with both of my children because I had preeclampsia. This time around, most of the third trimester, I just felt... uncomfortable. I had this headache that would not go away. You know that feeling when you wake up and you\u2019re like, \u2018I just don\u2019t feel like myself\u2019? That was persistent and pervasive.\n\nAt 35 weeks, I called my doctor\u2019s office to talk to them about it, and they sent me to triage. (It was later in the evening, and the office was closed.) They ran some tests and said, basically, that they weren\u2019t too concerned and there wasn\u2019t much they could do. So after a few hours, I went home. I got a call the next morning, and it was a nurse from my doctor\u2019s office who asked me to come in for a non-stress test to make sure the baby was doing OK.\n\nThey were looking at his movement and heart rate, and everything seemed fine, except he wasn\u2019t that active. They gave me some juice to try to get him moving. I felt a little bit of nervousness, but the practitioners did a good job of making it seem kind of like, this happens sometimes. Let\u2019s see if we can get baby to move around. I told them again that I had not felt well for weeks.\n\nThe nurses doing the non-stress test said they just wanted to check with the on-call doctor and told the doctor about my headache. At that point, they came back in and told me that they were worried that my preeclampsia had progressed to eclampsia, which can lead to organ failure and seizures. I needed to go in and have my baby today. I was there by myself because I kind of thought I\u2019d go in and get checked and they\u2019d send me home. My husband was at the gym, and I couldn\u2019t get a hold of him. I actually had to call the gym owner\u2019s wife to track him down.\n\nBecause of what turned out to be the severity of my stage of eclampsia, I was put on magnesium. Even though both of my babies were induced, their births were pretty different: With my first, I labored for 42 hours and they gave me as much time as I needed to move from one stage to the next. This time, they really moved me through things much more quickly. That\u2019s when I started to realize how serious everything was.\n\nThey started pitocin right away and, maybe 20 hours in, ended up manually breaking my water. About an hour later, my son was born.\n\nBoth of my births were similar in that when it was time to push, everything was really fast. With my daughter, I pushed three times. With my son, I pushed two times, and he was out.\n\nAfter he was born, they put him on my chest, but then they pretty quickly took him and started working on him. His lungs were pretty underdeveloped, and he wasn\u2019t breathing on his own. They were vigorously rubbing his entire body.\n\nOnce they did what they needed to on the little warming table, they brought him back to me to cuddle for a few more seconds. Then they put the little oxygen mask back on him and said they were going to take him to the neonatal intensive care unit to get him the help and attention he needed. Because I was on magnesium, I wasn\u2019t able to get out of bed at all. I couldn\u2019t sit up.\n\nI don\u2019t think I realized at that point that it would be 12 hours until I could see him again. Actually, usually it\u2019s more like 24 hours, but in my case delivering him really was the cure for the eclampsia \u2014 and I was healing quickly \u2014 so they let me see him sooner.\n\nThey ended up wheeling me to a recovery room, and I was there by myself for a while. That was what my husband and I had talked about beforehand, that if anything happened he should go with the baby. But being in that room alone was one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever done. Every instinct you have is screaming that this isn\u2019t right. Your baby is supposed to be with you. To be wheeled somewhere else without him felt... impossible.\n\nWhen I did see him again, I broke down. He was so tiny, and he needed so much help breathing. Honestly, I felt very broken \u2014 for quite a while \u2014 after the whole thing.\n\nWhat I felt was kind of this sense of failure, because my body was supposed to be able to keep my babies inside and keep them safe, and it didn\u2019t. One of the things I love so much about these photos is that they\u2019re healing. You know, I wanted intervention-free deliveries for my babies, which didn\u2019t happen. They help me look back and realize that there were a lot of beautiful moments. They help me step back and realize there wasn\u2019t any \u201cfailure\u201d in how my babies were born.\n\nMy husband is the fourth to have his name. And we hadn\u2019t found out ahead of time that we were having a boy, so seeing him react to having a son \u2014 seeing his joy at having him earthside \u2014 I\u2019m so grateful for that.\n\nMonet came to the NICU when our daughter got to meet our son for the first time. Those first photos, even though they\u2019re in a hospital room and he is attached to so much equipment, are beautiful. They\u2019re also honest and respectful of our situation.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. During his NICU stay, there were several times when he would stop breathing on his own, and the nurses would have to come in and kind of rub his sternum, or rub him on the back to get him to breathe in, and that was really traumatizing. I mean, it was traumatic on its own, but also because our daughter had a fairly severe allergy to eggs when she was a newborn that stopped her from breathing \u2014 and that we dealt with for 13 weeks before we figured out what it was. I definitely had some unresolved trauma from that. To then to see our son stop breathing... that was so hard.\n\nMonet Nicole\n\nThe day our son was discharged from the NICU, I saw the physician who had been on rotation when I gave birth. He stopped by during morning rotations and said: \u201cI\u2019m so glad I get to see him leaving. He was a really sick baby there for a while.\u201d That hit me pretty hard, because it was one of those times when I realized how much they had done to shield us, as parents, from how serious things were in the moment.\n\nIt was just another realization that things could have gone a lot differently for us. In a lot of ways, we were so lucky. We\u2019re both here, and we are past it.", "description": "Sara Peach's labor was induced because of eclampsia, and she spent most of her son's first day separated from him.
