Therefore, ETH price could decline below the $175 support in the near term.\n\nEthereum Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, Ethereum tested the $188 resistance area against the US Dollar. However, it struggled to continue higher, resulting in a fresh decline below the $185 level. The stated $185 level later acted as a resistance. ETH price extended its decline below the $180 level and it also settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price even broke the $178 support area and traded to a new weekly low near $177.\n\nA swing low was formed near $177 and the price is currently consolidating losses. It corrected a few points above the $178 level. Moreover, the price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $188 high to $177 swing low. However, the $180-$182 zone seems to be acting as a resistance for the bulls. More importantly, there is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $181 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\n\nAbove the trend line, the $183 level might act as a resistance since it coincides with the 100 hourly SMA. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $188 high to $177 swing low is also near the $183 level. The main resistance on the upside for Ethereum bulls is near the $185 level, above which it could revisit the $188 resistance.\n\nConversely, if there is no upside break above the $185 resistance, the price could continue to decline. The main supports are near $178 and $175. A successful close below the $175 support could start a strong decline in the near term.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is clearly struggling to gain bullish momentum above $185 and $188. Besides, there are many hurdles on the upside near the $192 and $195 levels. Therefore, the price could react to the downside unless the bulls clear the $185 resistance.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is struggling to move into the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently below the 50 level, with a bearish angle.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $175\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $185", "description": "Ethereum price is struggling to climb higher versus the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin.
