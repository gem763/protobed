Now Desmond Morris has been watching politicians, concluding that they are a breed apart, with a body language that speaks volumes.\n\nHe told The Telegraph that politics has become such a \u201cpantomime\u201d, that the best way to watch televised debates is with the mute button pressed: \u201cThen you\u2019ll see much more clearly what the politicians are really like. You can learn so much from their body language.\u201d\n\nWhile he describes US President Donald Trump as \u201ca master of domineering body language\u201d and says that Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u201csuper-exaggerates\u201d gesticulations to convey \u201cenergy\u201d, he is struck that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has \u201cvirtually no body language\u201d.\n\nIn studying President Trump, he has observed \u201ca whole range of tricks, which are so well done\u201d, not least his one-upmanship in shaking hands in a \u201cvery special way\u201d.\n\nHe explained that hand-shaking was not popular until the 19th century \u201cbecause it\u2019s essentially egalitarian\u201d: \u201cIf you\u2019re shaking hands with the king,... you are performing identical actions and, just for that split second, you are equal to the king\u2026 When President Trump meets another world leader and they shake hands, you might think that - because they\u2019re both world leaders - they would do the same movement. But, if you study his handshakes, you find that, in several ways, he manages to make himself superior.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, [there\u2019s] the \u2018equality handshake\u2019, where you offer your hand with the palm vertical. But if you\u2019re clever - and Trump does this with some leaders - you offer your hand palm down\u2026 Then the other person has to put their hand underneath yours. That means that Trump literally has the upper hand.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump jokes with French President Emmanuel Macron about their handshakes in front of NATO leaders Credit: REUTERS More\n\nThat is his \u201cfirst ploy\u201d and there are others, Dr Morris said, observing that Russian President Vladimir Putin is among leaders who have managed to get their own hand in the upper position: \u201cTrump then gets his other hand and pats them\u2026 on top, so he\u2019s now sandwiched their hand between his two hands\u2026 Patting someone is a paternal action for children\u2026 By patting them with his other hand, he\u2019s now destroying what they thought was going to be a superior move\u2026 He [also] leans his body forward to invade their space.\u201d\n\nHe observed that President Trump has modified his behaviour considerably since he became president: \u201cFor example, he has increased the use of the downturned corners of the mouth,\u2026making him look\u2026 Churchillian and very serious. If he\u2019s in a public situation, you can see him adopt this mouth posture to make himself look more\u2026 commanding.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhen he\u2019s sitting next to a head of state, he will adopt what\u2019s called \u2018the steeple\u2019, where all the fingertips of one hand are touching the fingertips of the other hand in a symmetrical posture. This is again a posture of dominance because it displays perfect balance between left and right... and is displaying his high status. He also uses \u2018the precision gesture\u2019 when he\u2019s gesticulating during a speech. He\u2019ll put his thumb and forefinger together in a ring shape, which is\u2026displaying\u2026 precise thinking.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson gesticulates while Leo Varadkar, Ireland's prime minister, speaks at a joint press conference Credit: Bloomberg More", "description": "He is a zoologist and animal behaviourist who transformed the way we look at human beings with his landmark bestselling books The Naked Ape and Manwatching.
