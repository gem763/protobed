Steps Down", "language": "en", "text": "Good Wednesday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\n\nWeWork begins life with new leadership\n\nAfter the news yesterday that Adam Neumann had stepped down as the co-working company\u2019s C.E.O. following a near-revolt from some of his own directors, WeWork must pick up the pieces and restore confidence in its business. It won\u2019t be easy.\n\nMr. Neumann agreed to relinquish his C.E.O. title and become nonexecutive chairman, the NYT scooped yesterday. He also agreed to reduce the voting power of his shares to three-to-one, from 10-to-one. The company appointed two current executives, Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, as co-C.E.O.s.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable end to Mr. Neumann\u2019s run. His charisma turned WeWork into a force in real estate with a meteoric growth rate. But his unpredictability and grandiose ambitions scared potential investors, which drove the company to postpone an I.P.O. and ultimately consider replacing him.\n\nHis ouster may force a reckoning at several longtime WeWork backers:\n\n\u2022 JPMorgan Chase had long courted both the company and Mr. Neumann as clients, Andrew notes in his latest column. That gave the bank deep insights into WeWork \u2014 and should have given it pause about potential conflicts of interest like certain deals that Mr. Neumann cut with the company.", "description": "Adam Neumann has given up leadership of the embattled co-working company.
