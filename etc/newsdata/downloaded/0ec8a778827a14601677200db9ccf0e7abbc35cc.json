Ten men and women told the news outlet that they either witnesses or experienced inappropriate conduct by Cox on the job. One man, one of Cox\u2019s subordinates, described Cox telling him that he loved him repeatedly and at one point licking his ear.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCox did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt is my life\u2019s work to lift up my sisters and brothers in the workplace and it is painful that anyone would make accusations such as those we have learned from a news reporter,\u201d he wrote in the letter. \u201cWhile I strongly refute the allegations, I am a lifelong defender of due process and trust the investigation process will sort the fact from fiction.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued by AFGE, he called the allegations \u201clies and scurrilous, politically-motivated attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a time when federal and DC government employees are under daily attack, it is imperative that their union not be distracted from the task at hand,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Cox was informed of the allegations against him, he ordered the investigation himself, the AFGE said in a statement issued by spokesman Andrew Huddleston.
