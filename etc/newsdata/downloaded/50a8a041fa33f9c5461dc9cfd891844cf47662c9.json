Other objects of desire are a little more taste-based. What\u2019s the next status water bottle or hand wash, for instance? Regular readers of the Strategist will know that we\u2019ve previously turned to resident Cool Guy Chris Black (he\u2019s a partner at brand consultancy Public Announcement) to help us answer both of those questions. For more of Chris\u2019s advice, he\u2019s now answering reader questions for us in a regular column. If you have a burning question about the next fanny pack or Noah rugby shirt, drop us an email with the subject line \u201cAsk Chris\u201d at strategist@nymag.com.\n\nWhat stuff do you use to care for your clothes? Any particular detergents/washing techniques, things you use to store or hang them, or other stuff that prolongs your garments\u2019 life?\n\n\n\nMost cheap detergents smell awful. You have to dig a little deeper (and spend a bit more) to find something that will both clean your clothes and leave you smelling on brand.\n\nThe Laundress Le Labo Rose 31 Signature Detergent Enter: the Laundress, a (Strategist-approved) boutique detergent brand that has collaborated with no less than known high-end gear collector John Mayer (LOL). They really thought of everything! Anyway, the Laundress has also partnered with celebrity-favorite perfumer Le Labo on a Rose 31 detergent that makes me want to do laundry every day. It\u2019s nontoxic and mild, so it does the job gently. The smell is mostly floral, but it\u2019s a little spicy, and more masculine than you might expect. $45 at Shopbop Buy $45 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nHex Performance Advanced Laundry Detergent You also need something special for your gym gear because it takes a beating. Hex is formulated for synthetic fabrics, so it will keep your Dri-Fit crispy and clean, ensuring that you won\u2019t smell like a locker room pre-workout. The packaging is genuinely offensive, but hey, it does the job (one bag promises to last for up to 35 loads). Otherwise, just dry-clean the important stuff (or learn how to dry-clean at home). It\u2019s not that serious. $13 at Amazon Buy $13 at Amazon Buy\n\nWith fall on the horizon, I\u2019m looking to replace my cooked boots. I\u2019ve read combat boots are making a comeback. What styles of boot would you recommend as both good-looking and durable?\n\nR.M. Williams Gardener Leather Chelsea Boots If I am honest, I don\u2019t really love combat boots. They remind me of Tank Girl and Hot Topic. My go-to would be something a little more sleek from the Australian boot gods, R.M. Williams. The shoemaker\u2019s Gardener boot is simple, classic, and durable. You can wear these anywhere, and they will last forever. $495 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nR.M. Williams Gardener Leather Chelsea Boots Bloomingdale\u2019s only carries the boots in black, but here they are in brown leather at Mr Porter. $495 at Mr Porter Buy\n\nDries Van Noten Black Lace-Up Combat Boots If you must have something in the combat style, this pair from Dries Van Noten is a nice step up from Army Surplus. No branding, black leather, rubber sole. $970 at SSENSE Buy\n\nDr. Martens Made In England Rixon Boots I would be remiss if I left Dr. Martens, the maker of my favorite derbys, out of the conversation. The brand\u2019s Made in England Rixon boot is much more affordable than the options above. Plus, it\u2019s sleek and straightforward for a combat style \u2014 you don\u2019t want to look like it\u2019s your first week of basic training. Marching through Soho should be chic! $315 at SSENSE Buy\n\nI\u2019m heading to Vegas with some of my boys (against my own volition). What should I wear for a night out without looking like a sleazy club promoter \u2014 or worse, someone trying way too hard?\n\nSadly, the Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger bandage dress and six-inch Louboutins are not for you. If you want to skip the line at XS to watch Virgil play Chief Keef to a roomful of finance bros on a molly holiday, you are gonna need the right fit!\n\nWe are going to start from top down. This popping neon-green zebra print button-down from Cobra SC is ideal for the club. [Editor\u2019s note: The shirt is available in more sizes here.] It\u2019s loud and casual, but too advanced for a Vegas promoter. Basically the male version of a going-out top. With such a wild shirt, the pants should be \u2026 understated. The Genuine Jean from the Feel is about as classic as it gets. No weird branding or fading, just simple, well-fitting jeans. To round it out, these Dries Van Noten leather croc-effect loafers are the perfect party shoe \u2014 dressy but still cheeky. Now that you look the part, hopefully, you have some connects because nothing looks worse than paying to get into a club!\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
