In the offshore market, the yuan was quoted at 7.0730 versus the greenback.\n\nFriday's data marked a further loss of momentum for the Chinese economy from the second quarter's 6.2% growth, likely raising expectations that Beijing needs to roll out more measures to ward off a sharper slowdown.\n\nThe world's two-largest economies have imposed tariffs on each other's goods in a dispute over China's trade and industrial policies that has slammed the brakes on global economic growth.\n\nWorries about weak U.S. economic data kept the greenback lower against other currencies.\n\nThe dollar traded at 0.9879 Swiss franc, close to the lowest since Sept. 25 and on course for its biggest weekly decline since Aug. 9.\n\nThe dollar was quoted at 108.56 yen, headed for its second week of gains.", "description": "The pound traded near a five-month high against the dollar and the euro after Britain's prime minister Boris Johnson and European Union leaders agreed a new deal for Britain to exit the bloc.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103769348-GettyImages-163212605.jpg?v=1571355931", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
