It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.\n\nTesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFollowing the news on Wednesday, Tesla\u2019s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.\n\n\u201cTesla nails it at last,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.\n\nBut Mr Wilson added: \u201cIn one sense, we shouldn\u2019t get too excited\u201d, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.\n\nTesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.\n\nSUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.\n\nTesla\u2019s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its \u201cSmart Summon\u201d feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.\n\nUS federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.\n\nMr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.\n\nThe company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Tesla proved its critics wrong in its latest set of financial results, unveiling an unexpected profit and record car deliveries, and announcing that it is ahead of schedule on a new model and a new plant.
