In the wake of the shooting that left 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo dead and eight others injured, Ascent Classical Academy, a charter school that was, until recently, part of the Douglas County School district, decided to arm its staff.\n\nThe problem is, the district doesn\u2019t like the idea of teachers carrying firearms. But the question should be: who cares?\n\nDouglas County School Board Superintendent Thomas Tucker went so far as to proclaim, \u201cWe will fight tooth and nail if any school, whether it is a neighborhood school or a charter school, that decides to arm its teachers. [If] it\u2019s a charter school, we are going to ask that they leave the Douglas County School District.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s just what the Douglas County School Board did in late August.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting with the superintendent and the board chair and some other staff last week, and we just realize that we were in different places in how we approached this,\u201d Ascent\u2019s Executive Director Derec Shuler said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see programs like this in the district.\u201d\n\nAscent Classical now \u201cplans to sever ties with the Douglas County School District and instead seek authorization from the state,\u201d The Denver Post reports. According to Shuler, \u201cThe practical effect for what will happen in the classroom isn\u2019t much. Kids will still get a great education. From our perspective, it is a lot more that our school will have to have on its plate, a lot more responsibility. We will have to accept to operate more autonomously.\u201d\n\nAscent should count its blessings. After all, school districts do what all government bureaucracy does: represent the narrow interests of a powerful few, create burdensome red tape, revel in its power to tell everybody else what to do, and collect unseemly amounts of other people\u2019s money.\n\nHas anyone ever stopped to wonder why, exactly, we need school districts at all? In 2015, there were roughly 13,600 school districts in America.That\u2019s 13,600 political bodies, all composed of power-hungry individuals, many of whom you likely disagree with, some of whom you may even loathe, vying for the authority to oversee the education of your child.\n\nWhat makes these people more fit than the child\u2019s own parents to determine how that child is educated? Willingness to conform completely with the policies of a corrupt, progressive, and ever-overreaching federal government seems to be the primary qualification.\n\nAfter all, John Castillo himself supports arming teachers. After Ascent parent Rachel Keane spoke passionately in favor of the school\u2019s armed staff policy, Castillo approached her. The Highlands Ranch Herald reported, \u201cI agree with you,\u201d [Castillo] said, wearing a T-shirt bearing a photo of his son who died in the May shooting at STEM. Seeing the shirt and realizing who he was, Keane pulled Castillo into a hug. \u201cKeep the passion,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if Ascent is calling for anything more radical than what government schools regularly promote with pride. California schools have 10-year-old girls participate in \u201ccondom relay races\u201d (not a joke). The teachers electing to carry firearms at Ascent have their concealed carry permits and are trained by local SWAT and law enforcement officers on proper handling of guns. They\u2019re also prepared to administer lifesaving first aid to trauma victims.\n\nEven if the school advocated for some useless, bizarre new policy, isn\u2019t it the parents\u2019 right to send their children to whatever school they find to be most aligned with their personal philosophies?\n\nShuler said arming teachers is \u201csomething that our parent community has been very vocal (about) wanting in the community.\u201d\n\nWho, then, is the school district to stand in the way of parents\u2019 doing what they think best? Moreover, why do school districts exist at all?\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions will be whether the charter school will still have access to some of the Douglas County tax dollars to support its operations since it is still educating students in that area,\u201d reports Channel 7 Denver.\n\nThere we go! It all comes down to money and the power that comes with wielding it. School districts are nothing but governmental bureaucracies on a smaller scale. Think, if you can bear it, of Russian nesting dolls filled with teachers union toadies created to carry out the decrees of a depraved regime.\n\nBeing a school board member is nice work if you can get it. Los Angeles Unified School District board members make a cool $125,000 a year. Yep. That\u2019s a six-figure salary. And telling other people how to raise their children? Priceless.\n\nSchool districts, and all educational entities tied to government, should be stripped of their funding and power. School districts are an unnecessary middleman. Tax dollars should instead be allocated to parents to decide where and how to educate their children. Whether that be in a school with armed teachers, or at home with armed parents.", "description": "In May, John Castillo\u2019s son was killed during a shooting .09/12/2019 3:15:45AM EST.", "authors": ["Teresa", "Beth Baumann", "Alex Nitzberg"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/3b03351f-5259-4939-8fec-06a9c908670b.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
