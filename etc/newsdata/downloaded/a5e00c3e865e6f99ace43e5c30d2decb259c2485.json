The gain for the S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks is a nice 18% or so since Jan. 1, and yes, the S&P is up by low single digits when you go back a full 12 months -- with plenty of ups and downs in between. This choppy market environment makes many investors a bit timid. And if you're looking for safer stocks right now, there's perhaps no sector that more stable than utilities. Many utilities are geographic monopolies. There may not be a ton of growth, but there's a lot of stability -- and as the following stocks show, a healthy helping of dividends to boot.\n\nSouthern Co. (ticker: SO)\n\nAt $60 billion, Southern Co. represents what many investors think about when they conjure up the idea of a utility stock. The Atlanta-based company operates electricity generation and distribution assets, including nuclear power plants, renewable facilities like solar, wind and hydroelectric generation centers, and traditional fossil fuel plants. It also operates a natural gas segment that offers wholesale gas services. SO stock has had its trouble in recent years including cost overruns and chronic delays on a massive new nuclear power plant. But the stock is up handily in 2019, hinting that brighter days may be ahead. Of course, the juicy dividend is a nice hedge against any future share price declines.\n\nCurrent yield: 4.2%\n\nDuke Energy Corp. (DUK)\n\nAnother big dog in the utility sector, Duke is a $67 billion behemoth that provides electric power to 7.2 million customers across a large portion of the U.S., from the Carolinas to Florida to Kentucky to Ohio. In addition to its unrivaled scale, DUK stock just notched its 15th consecutive annual dividend increase in August, as the power giant offered a modest bump to payouts as part of its long term commitment to returning cash to its shareholders.\n\nCurrent yield: 4%\n\nOneok (OKE)\n\nOneok isn't a traditional electric utility like Southern Co. or Duke Energy. It's an important distributor of energy across the U.S. economy through the processing and transportation of natural gas across the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions. With distribution operations from Oklahoma to Colorado and from Texas to North Dakota, this $30 billion company is at the center of the natural gas industry for much of the nation. Natural gas is an important bridge to a clean energy future, since it's the cleanest burning of all fossil fuels. And, more businesses are relying on OKE's natural gas operations to power their operations with less of a carbon footprint.\n\nCurrent yield: 5%\n\nAlgonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (AQN)\n\nLooking north of the border, AQN is a mid-sized an independent power producer in Canada that serves about 600,000 customers in the Toronto region with power and gas services. However, it also conducts a modest water and wastewater business right here in the U.S. with targeted operations in states like California and Massachusetts. Power is often seen as a necessity in this age of high tech, but water is even more important. That means Algonquin has a strong baseline for its business as customers will cut back on just about everything before they turn off the tap.\n\nCurrent yield: 4.2%\n\nEntergy Corp. (ETR)\n\nNew Orleans-based Entergy is a $22 billion utility that uses gas, oil, coal, nuclear and solar to generate power for roughly 3 million customers in the South, from Arkansas to Texas to Louisiana. ETR's portfolio is a bit \"dirtier\" than some other utilities, so there's a transition risk as global regulators become increasingly focused on carbon emissions from fuel sources like coal. That means ETR is allocating more of its cash toward capital expenditures and skimping a bit on dividends when compared with its peers. However long term investors should have confidence that these investments will keep Entergy relevant for many years to come.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.2%\n\nFortis (FTS)\n\nFortis operates an electric and gas utility network that includes Canada, the U.S. and the Caribbean serving roughly 2 million customers. It's clearly a complicated outfit and the broad and scattered operations don't quite add up comfortable margins as other companies. However, for dividend investors, this diversified customer base could actually be a nice draw. Furthermore, with dividends that are about 70% of total earnings, the yield is not just comfortably secure right now. The company's dividend payout could be set up for future increases if and when operations expand and the business improves.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The stock market is up strongly for the year, but in many ways that's just a trick of timing.
