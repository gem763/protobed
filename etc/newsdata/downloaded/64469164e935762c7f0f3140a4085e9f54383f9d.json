Somehow?\n\nIconic (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nDoctor Sleep riffs on the famous door (Picture: Warner Bros)\n\n\u2018There were definitely discussions about it, the question was always in what way and what would be appropriate given the mythology of the hotel and how Kubrick has taught us what happens to ghosts and people who are killed in the hotel,\u2019 Flanagan told Metro.co.uk ahead of Doctor Sleep\u2019s release this week.\n\n\u2018What we knew that we never wanted to do with any of the characters was try to artificially recreate other actors. We never wanted there to be a digital Wendy Torrance or Scatman Crothers [who played Dick Hallorann].\n\n\u2018It was very important to us we cast actors like Carl Lumbly and Alex Essoe who would remind of us of Dick and Wendy but would still be playing the characters and doing it their way.\u2019\n\nTrevor Macy and Mike Flanagan are behind Doctor Sleep (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \u2018When it came to Jack Nicholson, he is very serious about being retired and they had tried to get him to come out and do a cameo in Ready Player One. And he had said no Steven Spielberg.\n\n\u2018The thought he\u2019d be like \u201cwell, Mike Flanagan\u2026\u201d [laughs] I didn\u2019t think that was going to be realistic.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlanagan continued: \u2018He knew what we were doing from the beginning and wished us well.\u2019\n\nIn the film, Doctor Sleep tackles iconic scenes from the Shining, which were recreated for our viewing pleasure. Yes, including the famed blood-pouring walls.\n\nThe director admitted it was \u2018the most intimidating\u2019 challenge to undertake, but he was adamant in not trying to \u2018out Kubrick Kubrick\u2019.\n\n\u2018As long as we were coming from a place of reverence and trying to celebrate Kubrick\u2019s film and King\u2019s books that if we approached it from that perspective then that was the only way forward,\u2019 Mike said.\n\nMacy chimed in: \u2018King gave us a fabulous blueprint because Doctor Sleep is very much its own story\u2026there is a lot of rich dramatic ground to cover when you\u2019re talking about little Danny Torrance all grown up, his childhood is burned into everyone\u2019s brains and what would it be like to grow up with that is a really good question.\u2019\n\nDoctor Sleep is in UK cinemas Thursday.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
