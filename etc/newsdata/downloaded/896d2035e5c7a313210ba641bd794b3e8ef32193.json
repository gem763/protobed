But now he is returning to the fray with a proposed overhaul of France\u2019s pension system, long regarded as a third-rail of French politics.\n\nMr. Macron wants to extend the number of years that people are required to work before collecting their pensions, rather than raising the age of retirement of 62 for all workers. He also wants to consolidate France\u2019s 42 different retirement plans\u2014and their special benefits\u2014into one universal system.\n\n\u201cWe need to rebuild our pension system,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\n\nThe overhaul shows the former investment banker hasn\u2019t lost his appetite for creative destruction. It is the first step in a broader plan to slash government spending and deliver further tax cuts.\n\nAt the start of his presidency, Mr. Macron abolished France\u2019s wealth tax and loosened its rules for hiring and firing in an attempt to lure investors and tech companies to France. That fueled the rise of the yellow-vest movement, sending hundreds of thousands of protesters into French cities to torch cars and smash storefronts. Such carnage brought the government to its knees, forcing Mr. Macron to douse the crisis with billions in cash handouts for minimum wage earners.\n\nAny changes to the retirement system are expected to take months, and unions are already digging in for a protracted battle. The French capital was paralyzed Friday by a massive public transport strike. Tens of thousands of people were stranded as most metro and bus lines closed. Traffic was snarled for hundreds of miles around Paris. On Monday, thousands of protesters\u2014including lawyers, doctors and pilots\u2014hit the streets of the French capital.\n\n\u200b\u201cIt\u2019s a warning shot,\u201d said Marc Brillaud, a 48-year-old security agent for RATP, the company that runs public transport services in Paris, and a trade union leader.\n\nFrench lawyers demonstrated Monday in Paris against the government\u2019s proposals to overhaul the pension system.

A recent poll of 1,002 people conducted by Elabe showed 33% approved of the French leader compared with 23% in December, when the yellow-vest crisis was at its height. The jobless rate, meanwhile, has dropped to its lowest level in a decade following the labor overhauls.\n\nMr. Macron also has a new modus operandi. He has pivoted away from the top-down governing style that marked his earliest days in office. Instead, he is trying to build consensus by organizing more national debates across France through a series of town-hall discussions on policy-making. The forums helped mollify the yellow-vest protesters by countering their criticism of him as an out-of-touch \u201cpresident of the rich.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think measures to raise the age of retirement mean for the economy at large? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Macron has also learned to play his cards closer to the vest. Rather than outlining his plans for overhaul at the outset of negotiations\u2014as he did in a high-profile speech at the Sorbonne detailing his vision for a reboot of the European Union\u2014the French president is giving opponents the first word, sometimes to blow off steam.\n\nLast week, Mr. Macron sat before a crowd of social workers and job seekers inside a warehouse on the outskirts of Paris, listening to some of them complain about excessive bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cYou need to trust us,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Dupon, who runs a company that helps job seekers get back into the labor force, adding that he has 130 available positions that he isn\u2019t able to fill because of administrative stumbling blocks.\n\n\u201cWe need to improve ourselves to be faster and far more simple,\u201d Mr. Macron responded.\n\nAging Out Retirement age In France remains lower than in most other Western countries. Retirement age for people retiring in 2019, selected countries 67 years Greece Italy 67 66 U.S. 66 Netherlands 66 Ireland 65 and 8 months Germany 65 and 8 months Spain U.K. 65 and 6 months 62 France Men 60 and 6 months Russia Women 55 and 6 months\n\nThat approach has also served Mr. Macron on the world stage. While hosting the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, Mr. Macron squeezed conciliatory gestures from President Trump \u2014including the possibility of a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u2014by courting him over an impromptu lunch at the outset of the summit. And he recently installed allies atop the European Union\u2019s main policy-making bodies by discreetly lobbying leaders in Eastern Europe with whom he had clashed earlier in his presidency.\n\nCorralling French public opinion is a tall order. A recent poll of 1,010 people conducted by IFOP found that two-thirds of French adults don\u2019t trust Mr. Macron to overhaul the pension system. And his party, comprised of lawmakers from across the political spectrum, is divided over how to change it, with right-leaning members pushing to simply raise the age of retirement.\n\nAs it stands, Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal will make everyone work longer while allowing people who begin working at a young age to retire earlier than workers who attend college and get a later start.\n\n\u201cThey want to destroy a system that already works,\u201d said Christiane F\u00e9ral-Schuhl, who heads the national institution that represents all practicing lawyers in France. Under the proposed universal plan, lawyers would see their contribution nearly double and their pension decline, she added.\n\nAs France\u2019s population ages, the cost of retirement is rising. The system nearly broke even this year, but it is expected to run a deficit of 10 billion euros ($11 billion) by 2022, according to a recent government report.\n\nPayroll taxes fund dozens of pension programs that vary by sector, resulting in a system in which some employees get cushier\u2014and earlier\u2014retirements than others. Mr. Macron wants to replace these with a single universal system.\n\nPublic transport workers in Paris, for example, are entitled to retire as early as 52 years old.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s treason,\u201d said Bastien Berthier, a 39-year-old metro driver and trade union leader, who says he agreed to work during public holidays and take night shifts because he thought he would be able to stop working earlier. \u201cMacron is breaching our contract,\u201d he added.\n\nTransportation came to a standstill in Paris last week during a massive public transport strike.
