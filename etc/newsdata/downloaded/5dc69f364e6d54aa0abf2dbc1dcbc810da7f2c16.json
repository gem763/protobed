Mike Pence wants to make sure House Democrats understand that. Politico reports that the vice president will embark on a campaign tour through congressional districts that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but elected Democrats to Congress in 2018 to argue that Democrats are obsessed with overturning the first election, rather than focus on their issues:\n\nStarting this week, Vice President Mike Pence will embark on a national tour of congressional districts represented by Democrats who\u2019ve come out in support of the inquiry. The move comes as the administration is struggling to combat an intensifying investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. Each of the districts on Pence\u2019s itinerary were won by Trump in 2016, making them potent targets for Republicans. The vice president will travel Wednesday to the southwest Iowa district of Rep. Cindy Axne, and Thursday he\u2019s slated to visit the suburban Twin Cities district of another freshman Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig. The vice president is then scheduled to barnstorm an array of battleground districts, including those held by Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger. \u2026 While national surveys show growing support for impeachment, Republicans contend it\u2019s far lower in the Democratic-held swing districts they\u2019re targeting. The National Republican Congressional Committee released a polling memo last week that argued that two-thirds of voters in those districts \u201cagree that Democrats in Congress are too obsessed with impeaching the president and should be working on\u201d other issues.\n\nHow well will this go? The visit to Minnesota\u2019s 2nd CD, where I live, might not be particularly instructive. Trump did win it in 2016, along with Jason Lewis after John Kline\u2019s retirement from the House, but not by much \u2014 46.07%/44.88%. Barack Obama won this district in 2012 by an even thinner margin (48.91/48.85), after having lost it by only two points in 2008. Before that, George W. Bush won comfortably in both of his elections with solid majorities. The truth is that MN-02 has changed considerably over the last 22 years in which I\u2019ve lived in it, a truth that John Kline\u2019s popularity and integrity largely papered over until his retirement. The DFL has made a lot of inroads in state and local elections here, and even a new push by Pence may not recover it.\n\nStill, that may not be the case everywhere else, and even here in MN-02 impeachment probably won\u2019t sell. Trump may not be well liked, but voters here didn\u2019t send Angie Craig to Washington to tie up Congress for two years over Democrats\u2019 distaste for Trump. They promised to govern and to focus on voter priorities, and in suburban districts like MN-02, voters aren\u2019t prioritizing a Beltway food fight, which is what this is after the collapse of the Russia-collusion hypothesis.\n\nDemocrats want to counter by doubling down on impeachment and Pence\u2019s supposed involvement in Trump\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u201d:\n\n\u201cAt every stop Vice President Pence makes he\u2019ll have to answer for his own role in this growing scandal,\u201d said Cole Leiter, a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman, \u201cand any candidate who is still willing to appear publicly with Vice President Pence will have made it clear that they accept the Trump administration\u2019s wholesale eagerness to betray the office of the American president.\u201d\n\nEr \u2026 sure, that\u2019ll work. To keep this from looking like a case of political sour grapes, Democrats have to make this about Trump. Calling for Pence\u2019s impeachment will only make this look more like an attempt to reverse an election that Democrats didn\u2019t like rather than just win an election on their own. How\u2019s that project going? As Allahpundit noted in the previous post \u2014 poorly.\n\nMSNBC plan to make Pelosi president: \u201cYou could impeach Pence first. The problem is that Donald Trump then has to name his replacement. But I think that maybe a deal could be struck where he was told, if you don\u2019t make a replacement, then Nancy Pelosi does become president.\" pic.twitter.com/JjsiEbNCyh \u2014 Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 6, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s probably too late to stop Trump\u2019s impeachment after Nancy Pelosi\u2019s alea iacta est declaration. If there are any sane minds in the House Democratic caucus, though, they\u2019ll yank the leash back on this kind of talk, which will only amplify Pence\u2019s message in these districts. In fact, don\u2019t be surprised if Pence plays the audio in this clip from the stump. Pence and the RNC will do everything they can to make sure that House Democrat freshmen feel the pain for moving forward on Pelosi\u2019s impeachment rather focus on their voters.", "description": "The best defense is ...", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PenceMikeatHomeSecICE715-7-6-18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
