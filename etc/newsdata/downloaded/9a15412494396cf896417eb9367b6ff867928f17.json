Flotillas of rafts and canoes bob along the Rhine River, sunbathers lay out on the grassy shore, and on the largely empty streets an occasional public bus rumbles by, decorated for the festivities with Switzerland\u2019s familiar red flag with a white cross.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect holiday scene, except for one nagging detail. All this merrymaking marking the anniversary of Switzerland\u2019s confederation is taking place in Germany.\n\nOur spirit and heart are Swiss\n\n\u201cTo make holidays here, it\u2019s attractive,\u201d explained Roland G\u00fcntert, deputy mayor of the town of B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein in Germany. \u201cThis is just something you do. Our spirit and heart are Swiss.\u201d\n\nThe reason? This tiny spot of Germany is entirely surrounded by Switzerland, which makes it both an enclave and exclave, geographic oddities to trivia fans, but confounding to everyone else.\n\nFor the cartographically curious, an enclave is a territory or section of a territory completely surrounded by another entity \u2013 a prime example is the tiny nation of Lesotho encircled by South Africa. It\u2019s closely related to an exclave: a portion of a territory separated from its main part by another territory. B\u00fcsingen meets both definitions.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The tiny \u2018nation\u2019 you\u2019ve never heard of\n\n\u2022 Europe\u2019s strange border anomaly\n\n\u2022 A town split between two countries\n\nThe village\u2019s eastern border lies a mere 700m from the rest of the Federal Republic of Germany. And while politically this town of about 1,450 inhabitants belongs to Germany, economically it\u2019s part of Switzerland.\n\nJust like Switzerland, B\u00fcsingen operates outside of the European Union, and the town has been cited as a model for post-Brexit cooperation. Three years ago, a politician representing Belfast South suggested that Northern Ireland could be granted a special customs status, similar to the one governing B\u00fcsingen.\n\nAs with B\u00fcsingen and Switzerland, there would be limited customs or immigration controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, proposed MP Alasdair McDonnell, meaning that Northern Ireland could leave the EU with Brexit but remain tied to the Republic of Ireland. \u201cThere is a precedent for this in the German town of B\u00fcsingen,\u201d he said in a speech. Others, however, aren\u2019t convinced, countering that the hamlet of B\u00fcsingen is hardly a stand-in for Northern Ireland, which has a population topping 1.8 million.\n\nG\u00fcntert says at its heart, B\u00fcsingen\u2019s arrangement is pretty simple. \u201cWe have German laws and German government, and on the other part, we have the Swiss economy.\u201d\n\nNowhere is the division more evident than at Restaurant Waldheim. A line painted across its outdoor dining terrace marks the international border, so it\u2019s possible to be served a plate of schnitzel in Switzerland, and then reach into Germany to grab a stein of beer from the other side of the table.\n\nStill, for residents, living a binational life brings up daily contradictions and choices. Although commerce is typically conducted in Swiss francs and most residents work in nearby, larger Swiss towns, they still must pay the higher German income taxes. Children go to a local (German) primary school, but parents decide in which country they\u2019ll attend high school. Likewise, B\u00fcsingen locals have both German and Swiss postal and international telephone codes: callers can dial either Germany\u2019s +49 or Switzerland\u2019s +41, and still ring a resident. And perhaps most notably, the town\u2019s football club is the only German team allowed to play in the Swiss league.\n\nIt was all an adjustment for Sarah Biernat, who lives 30 minutes away in Singen, Germany, and crosses multiple international borders during her daily commute to B\u00fcsingen. She knew nothing about the area, having come to the town only once as a child for a dental appointment. Then, 11 years ago, she took a job at B\u00fcsingen\u2019s Alte Rheinm\u00fchle hotel, and on her first day of work found herself giving a customer change in Swiss francs. \u201cIt was like play money to me,\u201d she said.\n\nEven a decade later, the town still feels and sounds Swiss to her. \u201cThey talk like the Switzer. Their German is different.\u201d\n\nAs with most of the globe\u2019s enclaves and exclaves, there\u2019s quite a backstory behind this territorial identity crisis.\n\nFor B\u00fcsingen, the problem began in 1693, long before Germany existed. The village was under Austrian control when a family feud over religious allegiance led to the kidnapping of the Catholic-leaning feudal lord of B\u00fcsingen. His cousins hauled him to the nearby Swiss (and Protestant) town of Schaffhausen, where he was sentenced to life in prison. It took six years and the threat of Austria invading Schaffhausen to finally free the lord.\n\nThey said it would never go back to Switzerland \u2013 never, ever, ever\n\nA few decades later, when Austria sold its local holdings to the Swiss canton of Zurich, it held on to B\u00fcsingen \u2013 strictly out of spite, according to historians. \u201cThey said it would never go back to Switzerland. Never, ever, ever,\u201d the deputy mayor said.\n\nThat meant that when parts of the Austrian Empire were later absorbed by Germany in the 19th Century, B\u00fcsingen was claimed by the new republic.\n\nThe orderly Swiss tried to clear up the mess in 1919 when it held a referendum that saw B\u00fcsingen residents voting by 96% to leave Germany. But Berlin wasn\u2019t interested in giving the town up because Switzerland offered nothing in return.\n\nEven in the chaos of World War Two, the arrangement remained. Before German soldiers could return home to B\u00fcsingen on leave, they had to check their guns at the border and cover up their military uniform with a cape, said G\u00fcntert, whose relatives served in the German army. After the war, the division continued, turning daily shopping trips into an exercise in global trade.\n\n\u201cIt was complicated,\u201d said Elizabeth Arpke, who grew up in the area but was visiting B\u00fcsingen for the holiday. \u201cWhen you bought meat in Germany, you\u2019d have to cross the border [into Switzerland] and fill out forms.\u201d\n\nFinally, in 1967, Germany and Switzerland agreed to add B\u00fcsingen to the Swiss customs area, which removed border controls and checkpoints around the village of less than 8 sq km.\n\nToday, the problem is taxes.\n\nBecause the cost of living is higher in Switzerland than Germany, B\u00fcsingen residents typically earn larger salaries than their fellow countrymen. But since Germany has a higher tax rate, workers end up paying more than their Swiss neighbours.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a flip side too. Taxi driver Caroline Major estimates her rent is 50% less in B\u00fcsingen than if she lived a few kilometres away in Switzerland. She relocated from the German town of Friedberg two years ago and couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cI love my life. There\u2019s good energy here. It\u2019s so, so nice here.\u201d\n\nOthers have discovered that too. Because Germany offers a tax break for pensioners, B\u00fcsingen attracts retired Swiss residents. The result: \u201cThe young people go to Switzerland, and the old people come here. The village gets older every day,\u201d said Rainer Krause, whose daughter runs Restaurant Waldheim on the international border.\n\nPolitics aside, B\u00fcsingen makes for a lovely Rhine Valley getaway.\n\nThose intrigued by B\u00fcsingen\u2019s centuries-old spat can hike a well-marked path, which the town interchangeably calls the Enclave or Exclave Trail. The 11-stop excursion takes in river views, international border markers and even a vineyard, where terraces of German Riesling and Pinot Noir grapes ripen before they\u2019re trucked a few kilometres away to be made into Swiss wine.\n\nPerhaps the trail\u2019s first stop, a town hall mural on the village\u2019s main street, explains it best: a smiling worker holds a pole flying a German flag, while a Swiss one sticks out of his jacket pocket.\n\nDespite the confusion of living in a no-man\u2019s land, life seems pretty good here.\n\nThe deputy mayor notes how his village is ideally located under an hour by train from Zurich airport and a 10-minute bus ride to the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. As he sips an espresso at an outdoor cafe overlooking the Rhine, he points to the river where he played as a child and across the bank to the forest, a nature preserve protected from development.\n\nThe town, he says, \u201cis like paradise\u201d \u2013 another place, it\u2019s worth noting, whose borders have never quite been defined.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
