REUTERS/Chris Thomas\n\nThe lander of India\u2019s Chandrayaan-2 moon mission was attempting a \u201csoft,\u201d or controlled, landing near the south pole of the moon where scientists believe there could be water ice. ISRO lost communication with it just as it was about to land on the moon.\n\n\u201cData is being analyzed,\u201d ISRO Chairman K Sivan told a room full of distraught scientists at the agency\u2019s tracking center in Bengaluru.\n\nThe Indian designed spacecraft, which had been orbiting the moon, began descending towards the lunar surface at about 2007 GMT but scientists lost contact with it during the penultimate stage of the descent.\n\nFor a graphic on the spacecraft's planned landing sequence, click here\n\n\u201cVikram lander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed up to an altitude of 2.1 km. Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost,\u201d an ISRO official said. The lander was named Vikram after the father of India\u2019s space program, Vikram Sarabhai.\n\nA live broadcast from ISRO, India\u2019s equivalent of NASA, showed scientists grow tense and the floor fall silent as the control station struggled to get a signal from the lander.\n\n\u201cThere are ups and downs in life ... What you have accomplished is no small achievement,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the ISRO center, told scientists after being briefed by Sivan.\n\nSivan had earlier described the final moments of the landing mission as \u201c15 minutes of terror,\u201d due to the complexities involved with lunar gravity, terrain and dust.\n\nOnly the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 probe touched down on the far side earlier this year. Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April.\n\nThe south pole is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun. ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.", "description": "India lost contact with a spacecraft it was attempting to land on the moon on Saturday, the chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said, in a setback to the nation's ambitious plans to become the first country to probe the unexplored lunar south pole.", "authors": ["Chris Thomas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427100316&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8521O", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
