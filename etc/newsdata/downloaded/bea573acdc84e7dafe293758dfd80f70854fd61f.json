The inflows marked the most of any seven-month period since at least 2014, according to Lipper. People started completing the first tax returns under the new law in late January and February.\n\nThe purchases add to the already-high demand for municipal bonds, pushing up bond prices further and diminishing the benefit taxpayers are seeking. But they also make it easier and cheaper for governments to borrow.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you invested in muni bonds? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cHigh-income taxpayers oftentimes were a little bit taken aback by the fact that their tax bills either stayed pretty flat or maybe their aggregate tax bill increased. And that always raises a question of: What can I do about this?\u201d said Suzanne Shier, chief tax strategist for wealth management at Northern Trust Corp.\n\nThe vast majority of taxpayers got federal tax cuts under the law, but 12% of those with incomes over $1 million got tax increases.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because the new law capped at $10,000 the amount of state and local tax bills Americans could deduct from their federal taxable income. This hit the wallets of some high earners in high-tax states and layered the full burden of state and local income taxes atop federal taxes.\n\nAffluent taxpayers are generally the ones most able to reshape their investments to save on taxes. In some cases, they now face higher marginal combined income-tax rates than they did under the old law, giving them a larger tax incentive to invest in municipal bonds. Munis throw off interest that is free from federal taxes and generally from state taxes in the state where the bond was issued.\n\nAdvisers said sophisticated taxpayers moved quickly after the new law took effect, and taxpayers who bought munis in the immediate aftermath of the law generally got a bigger advantage than this year\u2019s second wave of buyers. Since the end of 2017, municipal bonds have produced returns of 2.3% nationwide and 2.5% for California bonds, according to Bloomberg Barclays.\n\nAs prices rose, driving down the income investors could earn from munis, the benefit to taxpayers seeking to cut their tax bills diminished.\n\n\u201cThe spoils go to the early birds in this sort of thing,\u201d said Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee.\n\nNicholos Venditti, who manages a portfolio of $500 million in tax-exempt California bonds for New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, said recently he has counseled California clients eager to invest that they may be better off in Treasurys or municipal debt from other states.\n\n\u201cI want all the money I can get,\u201d Mr. Venditti said. \u201cBut right now, today, there are not a lot of great options in the California market for me to invest in.\u201d\n\nThe demand for municipal debt issued in high-tax states has lowered borrowing costs for governments. In a deal priced last week, San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, system will pay a yield of 1% on a six-year bond. The benchmark rate for a muni bond with a similar maturity date and creditworthiness was 1.19%, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nAlso pushing up municipal-bond prices over the past several months: expectations of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut enacted last week, an appetite for fixed-income investments amid a 10-year bull market in stocks and a drop in supply that is another result of the 2017 tax overhaul. Congress ended the tax exemption for bonds refinanced before the refinancing date agreed upon in the bond agreement, driving down new issuance. Also, governments anxious about what Congress would do rushed to issue bonds in late 2017 before the bill passed, leading to a lull over the past year.\n\nA BART train in Oakland, Calif.

Governments confer their tax-exempt borrowing power on those entities because they are seen to spur economic development or have some other public benefit.\n\n\u201cWhen we bring a high-yield bond issue to market, we receive a lot of demand from a broad swath of buyers,\u201d said Sara Brown, head of the California general government group at Stifel, a municipal-bond underwriter.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAdvisers cautioned that investors sometimes get too enamored of the tax savings from buying in-state bonds and ignore some of the downsides. Those include lower yields than corporate debt and the danger of concentrating too much risk in one state. That is a particular concern for investors in New Jersey, where burdensome pension obligations have pushed the state credit rating to among the lowest of any state.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "description": "Investors in high-tax states like New York and California are piling into municipal bonds this year, fueled in part by the 2017 tax overhaul that raised tax burdens for some high-income households.", "authors": ["Heather Gillers", "Richard Rubin", "Heather.Gillers Wsj.Com", "Richard.Rubin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-95683/social", "published_at": "2019-08-07"}
