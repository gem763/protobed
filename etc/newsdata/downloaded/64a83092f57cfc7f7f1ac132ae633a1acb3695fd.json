Airtel and Vodafone Idea, two of India\u2019s largest wireless carriers, currently use Huawei equipment. (Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: As the U.S. restricts Chinese companies\u2019 growth in its market\u2014and vice versa\u2014India\u2019s tech sector has become the battleground for a proxy war between the two superpowers. Chinese and U.S. funds and strategic investors are trading off the biggest venture capital rounds for Indian startups. They spent US$2.8 billion and US$1.8 billion, respectively, in 2017, a trend that shows no sign of abating: Alibaba\u2019s Ant Financial is reportedly set to lead a US$600-million investment round in Zomato, which would value the Indian food-delivery company at more than US$4 billion. The deal would complement Ant\u2019s 40 per cent stake in Paytm, an Indian payments and e-commerce marketplace company. Alibaba also has an interest in ride-hailing app Ola via its investor Didi Chuxing; Ola\u2019s other backers include Tencent. The result is a Chinese-backed consumer app ecosystem to compete with U.S. firms Amazon and Uber, which operate e-commerce, ride hailing or food delivery under their own brands in India. Platforms like Netflix and Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp are also testing new features in the country. The foreign interest is running up against the Indian government\u2019s economic nativism. In December 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government imposed e-commerce rules that targeted Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart. On Thursday, Ross blamed the restrictions for the former significantly reducing its investment in India this year. Google and U.S. tech-sector associations also oppose India\u2019s proposed data localization laws. But all those rules benefit Reliance, which is launching an e-commerce platform based on wireless usage data from its Jio carrier\u2014the kind of national champion the Modi government is keen to promote. A Huawei ban will cost Airtel and Vodafone at a time when they\u2019re losing users and money in a price war to Jio.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
