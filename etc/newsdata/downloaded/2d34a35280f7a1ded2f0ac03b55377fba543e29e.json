Inevitably when that happens they get into the realms of talking about new contracts and negotiations at their clubs.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

You need to have a bit of a swagger. But it doesn\u2019t need to border on the arrogance and I think getting that balance right, I didn\u2019t think we achieved that completely.\n\n\u201c\u2019A lot of the goals conceded were individual errors; a loss of concentration. But it [overconfidence] contributed to errors in judgement on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI think because we had a good squad and they had been successful on the pathway, it was probably overconfidence. It was a mental thing, in terms of believing they were going to win the tournament and being probably overconfident and then realising in game play there is another team out there. That it\u2019s not a walkover.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go overboard on it because a lot of the goals conceded were individual errors, lack of concentration. I think it is a combination of things, that\u2019s not the only thing. But it contributed to errors and errors in judgement and decision making on the pitch.\u201d\n\nReed said that in reviews the players immediately blamed themselves rather than manager Aidy Boothroyd.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of feedback from then. They hanged themselves out and said they under-performed, it wasn\u2019t Adie.\u201d\n\nReed similarly defended the FA\u2019s decision to give Boothroyd a new contract before the tournament.\n\n\u201cWell that was in process before I arrived, so that was already under way, and I think my feeling would have been, had it come up, to go through that then take it away before the tournament would not have been a good idea, in terms of motivation and so on.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really see it as too much of a serious problem because the 21s go through two-year cycles so what Aidy\u2019s actually got is a new two-year cycle. So the key thing is what did we learn from that tournament in the summer, what can we now work on to improve that over the next two-year cycle? And yes, we under-performed, we had good quality players, we had a good quality squad, and we did under-perform.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0failed at this summer\u2019s Under-21 European Championship due to an \u201coverconfidence\u201d that \u201cbordered on arrogance\u201d, according to newly-appointed FA technical director Les Reed.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/21/19/england-u21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
