Described by some as \"pop-up prisons\", the facilities are housed in former schools and old government buildings, including in Raqqa, Deir Az Zor and Hasakah provinces. Up to 70,000 women and children, relatives of ISIL fighters, are also being held at the sprawling al-Hol camp, according to the United Nations.\n\nMutlu Civiroglu, an analyst based in Washington, DC, said there was \"no doubt\" ISIL would take advantage of the situation created by a Turkish operation.\n\n191007141408983\n\nWhile the US says the ISIL captives are now Turkey's responsibility, Civiroglu said Ankara may not be equipped to deal with the armed group's prisoners in SDF prisons or a resurgence in attacks.\n\n\"It's a huge burden for Turkey,\" he said. \"More or less the ISIS detainees are under control [right now], but it's going to be very hard [for Turkey] to control these people. Turkey does not have the advantage of the Kurds and the local groups \u2026 because it's unfamiliar territory for them.\"\n\nBrett McGurk, a former US presidential envoy to the anti-ISIL coalition, echoed the same sentiment in a Twitter post. \"Turkey has neither the intent, desire nor capacity to manage the 60k [60,000] detainees in al-Hol camp,\" he said.\n\nA general view of al-Hol displacement camp in Hasaka governorate [File: Ali Hashisho/ Reuters]\n\nBut Umit Yalcin, Turkish ambassador to the UK, told Sky News on Tuesday Turkey \"can deal with\" ISIL captives.\n\n\"We will handle this issue with our allies in cooperation ... We have that capacity and capability,\" he said.\n\n'Gift for ISIL'\n\nThe SDF has warned that ISIL remains a threat in the region. The Kurdish YPG-led forces warned on Monday a possible Turkish attack would \"reverse the successful effort to defeat ISIS\". In a Twitter post, it also said that such a development would lead to the \"return of ISIS leaders who are hidden in the desert\" and attempts at freeing the prisoners.\n\nOn Sunday, the SDF announced capturing an ISIL commander, while an August report by the US Department of Defense Inspector General Glenn Fine said the armed group \"has activated resurgent cells in areas controlled by the SDF\" to conduct attacks.\n\n\"They (ISIL) thrive on the management of chaos and so for them, it's going to be quite a gift,\" said Robert Wesley, president of the Terrorism Research Initiative, referring to a potential confrontation between Turkey and SDF.\n\n\"Especially if you have a movement by the Assad regime north of the river, especially into some of the oil areas,\" he said, referring to the likelihood Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces may use a Turkish offensive to reclaim the oil-rich Deir Az Zor province from the SDF.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the ISIL prisons are located in the region Turkey intends to create its \"safe zone\", Wesley said. Turkish officials have said the area would stretch 30km from the country's border into Syria.\n\nBut Wesley said Turkey may extend that zone if it wants to push back the Kurdish forces.\n\n\"Turkey will have to go deeper into the area to inflict a heavier defeat, or otherwise have to content themselves with a smaller zone of control,\" he said.\n\nWesley went on to urge European countries to take action on the European ISIL prisoners, which according to the SDF number around 1,000. European countries have refused to do so previously, and some have passed laws stripping citizenship from ISIL fighters who are dual nationals.\n\n\"This is a big threat \u2026 nothing has changed, Europeans have decided they'd rather pass the buck onto the US and the SDF and we're in the same position we were before,\" Wesley said.\n\n\"It's a good opportunity for them, [to say to] Turkey and the US, 'if you stay in the game here, if you maintain stability in the north we're going to provide some additional assistance with the detention facilities there, and become more actively involved'.\"\n\nYalcin, the Turkish ambassador, meanwhile urged countries to repatriate suspected ISIL fighters for trial at home. He told Sky News \"the ideal situation\" would be for states \"to take those people back to their own countries and they can bring them justice, take them to court or rehabilitate them\".\n\nFor his part, Trump, who has also been pressing European countries to take back suspected fighters, said the US would not take in any ISIL fighters.\n\n\"Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their 'neighborhood',\" he said on Twitter.\n\n\"They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7,000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us!\"", "description": "US says Turkey to be responsible for captives held by SDF but analysts say it is unclear if Ankara has such capacity.", "authors": ["Tessa Fox"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/16a46da437e448c59fe44f185157b437_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
