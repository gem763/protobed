The court, in upholding a previous ruling by a Scottish high court, judged that he had.\n\nNot only did the court declare the prime minister\u2019s action unlawful, it also declared the order itself, which Queen Elizabeth II issued at Mr. Johnson\u2019s request, \u201cunlawful, void, and of no effect.\u201d The request, said the court\u2019s president, Baroness Brenda Hale, might as well have been a \u201cblank sheet of paper.\u201d\n\nStephen Tierney, a professor of constitutional theory at Edinburgh University, said it was \u201castonishing\u201d that the court had ruled decisively that it \u201ccan review something as fundamental as that, done by Her Majesty, as unlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court is getting involved in what was largely seen as the internal workings of Parliament and its supreme power,\u201d Professor Tierney said. \u201cThat in itself is unprecedented in the U.K. system. It\u2019s far more similar to the sort of judicial review you\u2019d get in a country with a codified constitution. But to arrive at its conclusion the court has had to pluck unwritten constitutional principles from what they take to be political practice.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, the courts have intervened regularly to challenge actions of the Trump administration, such as its ban on visitors from predominantly Muslim countries. The Supreme Court routinely exercises judicial review by actively interpreting the American Constitution.", "description": "In ruling a suspension of Parliament \u201cunlawful,\u201d some scholars argue that the court brought an American style of judicial review to Britain, with all that entails.", "authors": ["Mark Landler", "Benjamin Mueller"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24Brexit-constitution1/24Brexit-constitution1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
