Matt Preston (pictured) has denied rumours he will be the new MKR judge - and says he has 'too much love' for Manu Feildel, Colin Fassnidge and Pete Evans to steal their jobs\n\n'Taking over MKR as host/judge is not on the agenda! I have too much love for Manu, Colin and Pete to do that!' he said of MKR's current cast Manu Feildel, Pete Evans and Colin Fassnidge.\n\nGary has not yet responded to the rumours he will join MKR.\n\nOn Monday, The Australian had speculated that Matt and Gary may be hosting the second of two MKR seasons that will screen in late 2020 as part of a new 'multi-year' contract with Seven.\n\nHmm!

Pictured L-R: Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston\n\nThe publication claimed that Matt and Gary were spotted meeting Seven bosses earlier this month and that, just days later, Seven boss Evan Wilkes called a 'sudden briefing' with staff working on MKR to announce a 'delay in filming'.\n\nDuring this meeting, Mr Wilkes reportedly informed MKR crew that the filming of series 12 had been delayed from December 2019 until February next year.\n\nThis 'delay' may relate to the supposed acquisition of Matt and Gary, whose contracts with Ten may well have them locked down until the end of this year.\n\nSetting the record straight!
