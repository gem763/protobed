Those meetings take place just days before the October 15 deadline for Washington to increase tariffs on US$250 billion ($371 billion) worth of Chinese products from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.\n\nAnalysts say China's leaders had lost faith in negotiating with an erratic Mr Trump and warned that Washington's expectations were too high.\n\nBeijing is showing no sign it is willing to compromise on some of Mr Trump's key demands, while investors globally were fatigued by wild swings in sentiment about the chances of resolving the US-China trade war.\n\nBloomberg cited sources this week saying Chinese officials had told visiting US dignitaries that the range of topics China was willing to discuss had narrowed. This meant Mr Trump's push to abolish Chinese government subsidies and consider industrial reforms were off the table.\n\nWashington is also showing little sign of compromise.\n\n\"The US has a high expectations about the trade talks. There are a lot of uncertainties,\" Jia Qingguo, a professor in international relations at Peking University, said.\n\nWashington agreed to delay the latest tariff increase initially scheduled for last week when China was celebrating the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule.\n\nSome academics said if this week's talks go well, that deadline could be extended further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZhu Feng, dean of the school of international relations at Nanjing University, said that while a breakthrough in this week's talks was unlikely, he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about a deal in the long term.\n\n\"It is unlikely they will reach agreement, but they will move forward. We cannot exclude the possibility that the date will be extended further,\" he said.\n\n\"If the US charges tariffs on October 15, China will take counter measures and the situation will deteriorate significantly,\" he said.\n\n\"The US will try to avoid this situation. The Trump administration is under economic pressure.\"\n\nUS commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, who is visiting Australia, announced this week that 28 Chinese companies would be added to a so-called entity list, which makes it harder for them to buy US goods. They were placed on the blacklist because of alleged human rights abuses against ethnic Uighur Muslims in China's west.\n\nAsked this week if he thought there would be progress in talks, Mr Trump said: \u201cCan something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows. But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely.\"\n\nChinese state media, similarly, said the talks could collapse completely, result in a deal or wind up with no change.\n\nWhile economists said the tariffs were adding to pressures on China's slowing economy, president Xi Jinping was showing no signs of buckling when he presided over the biggest military parade in the country's history in Beijing last week. China releases quarterly GDP data next week.\n\nThe trade war erupted in July last year when Mr Trump followed through on threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods for allegedly unfair trade practices. The United States wants Beijing to address intellectual property theft and subsidies for state-owned companies. US President Donald Trump followed through on months of threats to impose sweeping tariffs on China for its alleged unfair trade practices.\n\nThe United States has imposed tariffs on US$550 billion worth of Chinese products, covering virtually all goods imported into the country. China has either imposed or threatened tariffs on almost US$120 billion of US goods.", "description": "The chances of genuine progress when China's top negotiators return to Washington for the first time since May  are at an all-time low.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5479%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_13%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0880f0340887564429ce05a641a569ebfd0c93b9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
