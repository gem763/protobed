However, black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people were still over four times more likely to be stopped than white people.\n\nFor those who identified as black or black British, the disparity was even greater \u2013 they were 9.7 times more likely to be stopped and searched by an officer than a white person.\n\nAfter the Home Office rolled back restrictions to the controversial tactic in August as part of an attempt to curb knife crime, an equality impact assessment warned that more people from BAME were likely to be targeted despite not having committed crimes.\n\nThe government report also warned that relaxed conditions could create \u201cbroader issues\u201d among the public in terms of their trust in the police.\n\nThe statistics, published by the Home Office, also revealed that the number of people being detained under the Mental Health Act rose by 12% in the same year \u2013 a total of 33,238 in comparison with 29,662 the year before.\n\nUnder the act, an officer can remove someone suffering from mental ill health from a public place to a place of safety if in their judgement the person requires immediate care or control in the interests of their safety or others.\n\nAlthough the most common reason for carrying out a Pace stop and search was on suspicion of drug possession \u2013 accounting for 61% of all instances \u2013 the number of people searched on suspicion of carrying knives or other weapons also rose to 59,272.\n\nA further 13,175 stop and searches were carried out under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act in anticipation of violence \u2013 more than five times the number of searches made under this power this year before.\n\nIn March this year Sajid Javid, the then home secretary, enhanced section 60 powers, giving police officers more scope to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion.\n\nThe move came after official statistics showed fatal stabbings were at their highest level since records began.\n\nThen in August, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the current home secretary, Priti Patel, loosened restrictions on the use of the tactic even further.\n\nWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said the time had arrived to \u201ccome down hard on crime\u201d, while Patel told the Sun on Sunday she would ensure police had \u201cthe resources and the powers they need\u201d to protect people.\n\nOf the overall 383,629 stop and searches carried out by forces in England and Wales, 73% or 279,601 resulted in no further action.", "description": "Police use tactic 370,454 times in year to March \u2013 up from 279,728 in previous 12 months", "authors": ["Amy Walker", "Katrina Ffrench"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19dfbdccdb56b51d673a4be23b5146b77c97f389/0_25_3750_2251/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c583ca50ef876366310c2d90788bb9a6", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
