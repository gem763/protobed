Before Kellyanne Conway became Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager during the homestretch of the race, Conway had publicly criticized candidate Trump for refusing to release his tax returns and for his \u201cvulgar\u201d rhetoric. Conway currently serves as one of Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders and as his White House counselor.\n\nEven if Mulvaney had never uttered a critical word about Trump, the chances he would last long in a chief of staff post would have likely been slim regardless. Two knowledgeable sources told The Daily Beast on Friday that Mulvaney has indicated in recent weeks that he definitely would not want the chief of staff position beyond a temporary, interim assignment.\n\n\u201cWhy would he? He's a sane man,\u201d one administration source said, bluntly, referencing the routine humiliation, reputational damage, and backstabbing that Trump\u2019s current and past chiefs of staff had famously experienced.", "description": "Mulvaney left his House seat the next year to serve Trump as both director of the Office of Management and Budget and Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.", "authors": ["Jackie Kucinich", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Washington Bureau Chief", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_575,w_1023,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1544842753/PSX_20181214_212811_o7l044", "published_at": "2018-12-15"}
