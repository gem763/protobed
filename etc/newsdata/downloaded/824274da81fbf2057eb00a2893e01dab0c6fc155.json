A school show inspired a lifelong love of performing\n\n\u201cI think I was 14 going on 15, to steal from the Von Trapps, and I got cast as the Pirate King [in The Pirates of Penzance] as my first time auditioning for the school musical and to get one of the lead roles was an enormous vote of confidence, it just felt like \u2018Oh, OK I could be good at this\u2019 and I just remember working so hard\u2026 I just remember the applause at the end of that thing feeling like the most gratifying sound I had ever heard and I\u2019ve been chasing that ever since.\u201d\n\nHe starts writing under a pseudonym and what\u2019s more hip hop than writing under a pseudonym? Lin-Manuel on Alexander Hamilton\n\n4. What\u2019s the Hamilton and hip hop connection for him?\n\nSoon after he started reading a biography of Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Lin-Manuel knew he would be the perfect subject for a hip hop musical. \u201cThis guy (Hamilton) is a wordsmith and he used words to get himself out of his circumstances.\u201d As a teenager, Hamilton wrote an account of a hurricane striking the Caribbean island of St Croix: \u201cIt is so good that it is published in, I think, the Danish American Gazette and his cousin starts to take up a collection to get him off the island and in that moment I thought \u2018Well that\u2019s hip hop!\u2019 \u2014 that notion of writing about your struggle so specifically that you transcend it and that you elicit a response in others. He starts writing under a pseudonym and what\u2019s more hip hop than writing under a pseudonym?\u201d\n\n5. What was it like rapping with President Obama in the White House Rose Garden?\n\n\u201cThat was a not unstressful experience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was surreal, it was their idea actually\u2026and I remember talking to the President at the time and saying \u2018If you could start slow and speed up that would sort of make it more dynamic\u2019 and he cut me off mid-sentence: \u2018I know, I know! We\u2019re just going to do what we\u2019re going to do!\u2019 and I was like \u2018OK\u2026\u2019 So it was scary and probably not my best freestyle but the best I could do in that moment with the leader of the free world!\u201d\n\n6. What has helped him most as a writer?\n\n\u201cThe best recipe for being a writer is being a little out of place everywhere. When I was five years old I got into this elite public school called Hunter and so I was shuttling from New York\u2019s 200th Street to the Upper East Side. So I\u2019m the kid who goes to the fancy school in my neighbourhood, I\u2019m the kid who speaks Spanish with a kind of messed up gringo accent in Puerto Rico and at school I\u2019m the kid who lives all the way uptown. That\u2019s a great recipe for making a writer because you\u2019re always thinking about which part of yourself you\u2019re bringing into the conversation, which part of me is most applicable to the people I\u2019m around.\u201d", "description": "Lin-Manuel Miranda shares the eight tunes he'd want to take with him", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07q3dkz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
