Avoid people who put unnecessary pressure on you\n\nLineker in 1998\n\nGary praises his parents for never putting pressure on him as a young footballer. \u201cThere\u2019s a calmness in my upbringing which I think has given me a calmness in my adult life,\u201d he says. His parents would watch him play, and support him, but \u201cthey just kept out of it.\u201d (With one exception: when a young Gary lost his temper with the ref his dad marched on to the pitch and dragged him off by the scruff of the neck \u2013 something he attributes his flawless footballing disciplinary record to!)\n\nHe says parents who get carried away shouting from the side lines will often do more harm than good. \u201cNinety-nine point nine percent of what they say is wrong. Ninety-nine point nine percent of what they say is damaging their children. It\u2019s instilling fear into them,\u201d says Gary. \u201cIf you play football or any sport with fear, you will perform less well.\u201d Parents should applaud their child\u2019s efforts but, most importantly, \u201cjust let them play.\u201d\n\n2. Don\u2019t specialise too early\n\nGary wasn\u2019t necessarily destined to be a professional footballer. As a teenager he was also a passionate cricketer and actually believed he was better with the bat than with the football. But it was the latter that presented the first major opportunity in the form of an apprenticeship at Leicester City.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many things that need to come together to make it to the very, very top,\u201d says Gary, which means keeping your options open is important. \u201cTry all sorts of different things,\u201d says the ex-footballer. And that includes working hard at school. \u201cMy advice to all kids, which I didn\u2019t take at all myself, is to cover all bases.\u201d\n\n3. Step out of your comfort zone\n\nAs a young player, Gary strove to stretch himself. From Leicester City he joined Everton who were a trophy-winning side at the time. Everton were a brilliant team in the 1980s, he says, and he relished playing with better players and the quality that Everton had in abundance. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to push yourself, certainly in sport,\u201d says the ex-footballer. \u201cRelish it. It\u2019s an opportunity.\u201d", "description": "Advice from one of England's footballing greats", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07pqvgr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
