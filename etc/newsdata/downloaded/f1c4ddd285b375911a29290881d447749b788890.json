And with Dow Jones Industrial Average constituent Home Depot (NYSE:HD), you don\u2019t have to look very far to appreciate that very fact. But is now a good time to buy Home Depot stock? Let\u2019s examine what\u2019s happening off and on the price chart to reach a stronger, risk-adjusted decision.\n\n3 Reasons You Should Buy into the Home Depot Stock Bump More\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt has been good year for the market, albeit a volatile one at times. The Dow Jones is up nearly 17% and less than 1% from recapturing late July\u2019s all-time-high. At the same time, Home Depot stock\u2019s gain of 36% has more than doubled the venerable blue-chip index while hitting fresh highs.\n\nOnly the Dow\u2019s Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and its return of nearly 39%, is larger than HD\u2019s rise through Friday\u2019s close. However, that top spot has come at a price. AAPL stock\u2019s gains have failed to match Home Depot\u2019s technical wherewithal with shares still 5.5% beneath its October all-time high.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, what\u2019s behind the burly gains of America\u2019s largest home improvement retailer? No doubt 2019 has raised the specter of potential difficulties for Home Depot and peer Lowes (NYSE:LOW) given the ongoing U.S. China trade war and retail shelves lined with \u201cMade in China\u201d products.\n\nBut so far, HD stock has managed to trump those fears.\n\nRemoved from trade war concerns of what might be, a defensively positioned Home Depot has benefited from this summer\u2019s interest rate cut by the FOMC and ongoing demand for home improvement. And the good times, which showed up in August\u2019s earnings beat, aren\u2019t over either.\n\nAccording to Citi analyst Gregory Badishkanian, HD stock enjoys \u201cstill-solid underlying macro fundamentals and housing drivers,\u201d which should help with further sales and margin wins. For its part Citi reaffirmed its buy rating while lifting the price target on HD from $246 to $269 and a premium of 15% compared to Friday\u2019s closing price.\n\nHome Depot Stock Price Monthly Chart\n\nHome Depot Stock Price Monthly Chart More\n\nTechnically speaking, Home Depot stock appears ready for a strong second-half of 2019 after dismantling a large bearish topping pattern.\n\nIn August, HD produced an earnings-driven breakout from a 20-month long broadening base pattern. This type of formation is generally viewed as bearish once the fifth pivot receives price confirmation through the low of the monthly candlestick. Home Depot stock obliged bearish shorts as it traded beneath July\u2019s low of $212.39 and eventually down to $197.84 before quickly and unequivocally failing.\n\nA bullish earnings gap and follow-through in Home Depot stock took shares to new highs while also breaking out above angular pattern resistance. Now September\u2019s price action is confirming August\u2019s engulfing candlestick while being supported by a bullishly positioned stochastics indicator.\n\nWith HD shares just a couple percent above the August high, it\u2019s time to embrace the bearish pattern failure as an important signal to go long shares. I\u2019m inclined to see Citi\u2019s price target of $269 to perhaps as much as $275 in Home Depot stock as a reasonable forecast for shares.\n\nMy recommendation is to simply buy Home Depot stock today and set an initial stop-loss below $219. Early Monday and with HD trading around $232.50, that works out to price exposure of 6%. That\u2019s attractive relative to the risk taken. And smartly, it pulls the plug on the position just in case the broadening pattern has a repeat and more bearish performance in store for Home Depot stock.", "description": "There's always a bull market somewhere.
