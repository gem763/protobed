I wish I had brought a smartphone holder. It\u2019s in my pocket,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fingers are killing me. Let\u2019s warm them up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen the path becomes narrower, with a fence on the left, before sloping down.\n\n\u201cOh, it's slippery, it's so slippery, it's dangerous,\u201d he said, still laughing.\n\n\u201cHere are rocks. We can follow the rocks. It\u2019s pretty dangerous. I can climb down by sliding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s steep. The path is covered with snow \u2026 Am I on the right path? I\u2019m slipping! Here it\u2019s also dangerous with this slope.\u201d\n\nFinally, he said only \u201cslipping.\u201d\n\nThe sound of his slide can be heard on the video, along with a jumble of images including his boots, climbing poles, and a smartphone before it ends in a freeze frame of the snow, rock and part of a blue pole.\n\nAD\n\nIn the video, a woman\u2019s voice can also be heard, but it seems to be coming from his phone.\n\nPolice said they had received several calls from viewers watching the man\u2019s ascent, public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nAD\n\nPolice sent a helicopter to look for the climber, while a 10-member rescue team began scouring the area on Tuesday morning, finding signs of a fall that day but no body.\n\nNow police from Shizuoka prefecture say they have found a body but have not yet identified it, NHK reported.\n\nThe climbing season for the 3,776-meter (12,388-foot) peak ended on Sept. 10, with the official website advising that trails and huts are closed after this date and it is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d to climb the mountain during this period.\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Embassy says that some climbers nevertheless attempt to climb the mountain during the offseason, adding that every year, \u201ca number of climbers \u2014 including Americans \u2014 are killed while attempting to climb Mount Fuji.\u201d\n\nIn August, a Russian woman was killed by a falling rock.\n\nThe first snow was observed on Mount Fuji on Oct. 22, which was 22 days later than in an average year and 26 days later than in 2018, according to Japanese media.\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The man is heard saying\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous\u201d and\u00a0\u201cslipping\u201d before the camera shows his fall.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ulQv_Oa2yoiyNGcnHwThrvmixmg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AL7NX3H26UI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
