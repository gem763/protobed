Despite reading some negative reviews online about the hygiene and cleanliness that sent alarm bells ringing, we were reassured by Tui that there were no issues to be concerned about.\n\n'Within the first day of being there, our worst nightmares were confirmed.'\n\nThe family's flight was delayed so they didn't arrive at the four star resort until 5am, but sleeping was made impossible after they saw the conditions of the bedrooms they were expected to stay in.\n\nThe Wyldes, who spent \u00a34,428 on the holiday, said they were left disgusted after finding their hotel was infested with ants, whilst their sheets were found to be blood stained.\n\nAndrew, a full time carer to his daughter, said: 'We noticed straight away that there were ants crawling around both rooms, pubic hair in the bathrooms and blood stains on the bedsheets. It just wasn't up to standards at all. We were told that the Tui rep wouldn't be available until 9am and that we'd have to wait to speak to someone.'\n\nAll the children, aged between three and twelve, were left in tears at the state of the property.\n\nWhen the family eventually complained to their Tui rep, they asked the hotel to clean the rooms immediately. However, after arriving back at the room two hours later, it was obvious just a quick clean had been done.\n\n'We expressed our disappointment and the hotel manager agreed it was unacceptable and offered to do a deep clean.'\n\nAlthough hotel management offered to give the family a room upgrade, this wasn't until three days after their arrival.\n\nThat night, after the family returned to their new room after having dinner, they found bedbugs crawling all over the mattress and pillow cases of their bed.\n\nAndrew said: 'The children were very unsettled and my wife stayed up all night in an armchair. We came on holiday to enjoy ourselves. Caring for our six kids, including one with a disability is hard, and going on holiday is a chance to relax which we were unable to do.'\n\nThe following morning, Andrew went to the reps again to complain, showing them video evidence. They offered to move the family to a nearby complex, the Atlantica Porto Bello Royal.\n\nAlthough the hotel the family were moved to was a five star resort, it had no disabled access, or child friendly facilities as it was marketed just for adults.\n\n'It was a lovely hotel but just not suitable at all. It was the complete opposite of what we'd requested when booking our holiday with Tui. We were put in rooms up two flights of stairs and there was no lift. I had to lift my disabled daughter down two flights of stairs every day.'\n\nTo make matters worse, the family had unfortunately brought back the bedbugs with them from the previous hotel.\n\n'They had got into our suitcases so we had to throw ours away that were expensive and Tui replaced them with cheap ones that weren't anything like our original matching cases.\n\n'Our clothes were riddled with the bugs so had to be sent off for cleaning leaving us without a change of clothes for nearly two days. When we got our clothes back, a lot of the items had shrunk.'\n\nDisappointing: Blood stains and bed bugs found on the covers of the family's hotel in Kos\n\nAndrew said his biggest heartache was for his daughter Alanna-Rose. 'It was not a fun experience for any of the kids but particularly for Alanna-Rose. It wasn't fair, she was supposed to be having the time of her life.'\n\nThroughout the experience, the family continued to alert the Tui holiday reps of the faults they found and also tweeted the holiday company. In response, they were offered a \u00a3250 Tui holiday voucher, which Andrew said was unacceptable.\n\n'We spent \u00a34,428 on this holiday and so I was insulted at their offer of a holiday voucher. This experience has put me off using them ever again and so why would I want a Tui holiday voucher?'\n\nDespite Andrew contacting Tui again, he was told the holiday firm couldn't find any issues or the family's original complaints. It also said it was not prepared to compensate the family.\n\n'We have video evidence and a letter from the hotel manager apologising about the problems we were faced with, yet Tui still deny it all. We booked specifically for disabled access, children's facilities and entertainment. The many Tui offerings we were promised, including the younger kids learning to swim, were not available.\n\n'I'm not prepared to fly with them again and as a result I am currently in the process of cancelling next year's holiday which is booked through TUI, but have been told it will cost me \u00a3400 to cancel.'\n\nAndrew Wylde's six children were left in tears after discovering that the hotel was unclean\n\nA Tui spokesperson said: 'We are very sorry to hear of Mr Wylde's experience in Kos. As this is now a legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\n\n'We'd like to reassure customers that we carry out regular health and safety audits, including hygiene, at all of the hotels we feature.'\n\nWhilst still in Greece, in order to try and claim compensation for their nightmare trip, Andrew contacted Bott and Co solicitors and asked the firm for advice. They advised him to write everything down, take photo and video evidence and continue to make complaints to on site Tui reps.\n\nThe solicitors took on Andrew's case and the matter is currently ongoing.\n\nDavid Bott, Senior Partner at Bott and Co said: 'This family were massively let down by Tui. The holiday company were well aware of the family's holiday needs, including disability requirements and were assured they would be catered for.\n\n'They were faced with sub-standard accommodation and while the replacement hotel they were sent to was satisfactory in its standards, it was completely unsuitable for this family.\n\n'Tui failed to honour their agreement and we believe that the clients should be compensated for the disappointment and distress that this caused under the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 2018.\n\n'We will also be exploring a claim under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 as Tui had a responsibility to provide all the elements of the package, which they did not do.'\n\nUnfortunately, having travel insurance would not make much difference in this situation, according to the experts.\n\nBrian Brown, head of insight at Defaqto, said: 'Failure to provide an adequate hotel as promised is a contractual issue between the traveller and the holiday company, and travel insurers wouldn't get involved.\n\n'No travel policy will provide cover for the costs of alternative accommodation if your original hotel just isn't suitable or up to the standard you require or expect.'\n\nThis is Money has previously reported on a number of different Tui customers who have reported issues on holiday.\n\nOne included a young family who were refused a refund on their \u00a32,500 holiday as they refused to fly to a hotel that was reported to be plagued with sickness.\n\nAnother terminally ill man was left out of pocket after Tui refused a refund despite the fact he was no longer able to travel.", "description": "Andrew Wylde and his wife Danielle, of Wallasey, Merseyside booked a one week holiday to Atlantica Holiday Village Kos with their six children\u00a0in June 2019, hoping for a relaxing break.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
