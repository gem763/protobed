Warren\u2019s plan would try to even some of that out and would tax at two percent any person\u2019s net worth above $50 million dollars. For those with a net worth over $1 billion, the tax rate goes up to three percent on everything above that threshold.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nCurrently, the way our taxes are structured, the working class pays a higher tax rate than the richest Americans. And Americans are A-OK with taxing the rich, according to polling.\n\nBut, because of this proposal, Warren is not popular among the Wall Street elite, who see her plan as a threat to their way of life, and Novogratz confirmed that in his interview.\n\n\u201cNinety-seven percent of the people I know in my world are really, really fearful of her,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like her, they\u2019re worried about her, they think she\u2019s anti-rich\u2026 It\u2019s a little carried away.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s insanity \u2014 insanity that they feel like victims: \u2018They\u2019re going to come and get us.\u2019 No! You\u2019re going to get taxed a little more. Lighten up!\u201d\n\nBut, his defense of her aside, Warren doesn\u2019t have Novogratz\u2019s vote. He said he\u2019s looking for a more \u201ccentrist\u201d candidate like Pete Buttigieg. Of Warren, he said, \u201cI\u2019m hoping she pivots. She\u2019s such a good politician. She\u2019s so smart. She\u2019s witty.\u201d\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
