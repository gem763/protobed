Dozens of trucks were spotted near the Daman oil-gathering facility, 42km east of the city of Deir ez-Zor, as well as near Mayadin.\n\nA column of 22 fuel trucks was also located in the neighboring Al-Hasakah Province. The images were dated August and September this year.\n\nThe trucks taking part in the smuggling operations are being protected by \u201cUS troops and the personnel of the US private military companies,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesperson Major General Igor Konashenkov said.\n\nWhenever a convoy gets attacked, the US special forces and military jets are being called in to defend it.\n\nUS President Donald Trump declared that US troops would be pulling out of Syria earlier this month. Pentagon chief Mark Esper, however, later clarified that some soldiers would be deployed to Deir ez-Zor to secure the oil fields from Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) militants.\n\nKonashenkov accused the US of trying to keep its foothold in the region, continuing to exploit Syrian resources.\n\nWhat Washington is doing right now is seizing and holding the oilfields in eastern Syria under its armed control, which is tantamount to international state-sponsored banditry.\n\nThe major general further claimed that the revenue from the illegal oil trade goes through the brokerage companies and ultimately lands in the hands of the \u201cAmerican private military contractors and the US security agencies.\u201d\n\nThis is the real reason the Pentagon wants to \u201cprotect the oilfields in Syria from the mythical \u2018ISIS secret cells\u2019 forever,\u201d Konashenkov said.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turks appeased, Kurds saved, US gets breathing space: \u2018Russia takes on job that US failed at\u2019 in Syria\n\nTensions in northern Syrian escalated earlier this month after Turkey launched an offensive against Kurdish forces it considers terrorists. Ankara wanted to create a 30-mile safe zone along its border with Syria, but later halted its campaign to allow the US to facilitate the withdrawal of the Kurds.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian government troops and Russian military police entered the cities of Manbij and Raqqa shortly after the US soldiers left. Turkey and Russia further agreed on joint patrols along the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
