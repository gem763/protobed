I\u2019m pleased that the USDA Inspector General has responded to my concerns and will conduct a full investigation because this data is essential to farmers\u2019 livelihoods and the future of our food supply,\u201d Pingree said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nThe inspection comes as many researchers are fleeing USDA as it moves its two main research agencies to Kansas City. USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service has lost nearly 80 percent of its employees due to the relocation.\n\nThat flight has also impacted the agency\u2019s ability to release research.\n\n\u201cDue to decreased staffing levels, ERS will for considerable time be unable to provide the same level of breadth and depth in its economic research and outlook analysis as it did in the past,\u201d the agency wrote in a memo obtained by The Hill before listing reports that will be delayed or discontinued until further notice, including those on major commodities, food stamps and rural economies.", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) inspector general is launching a probe into whether the agency withheld reports on climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/climatechange_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
