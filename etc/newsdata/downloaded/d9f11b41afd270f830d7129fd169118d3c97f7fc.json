We believe the firm has established a wide moat primarily based on customer switching costs. Graco\u2019s products often perform a mission-critical function and are integrated into a customer\u2019s manufacturing process but typically account for a small portion of overall costs (for example, a paint system at an auto assembly plant). The company has a large installed base of equipment, and customers tend to replace components like-for-like, given the potential cost of unscheduled downtime or wasted material from switching to a cheaper alternative. This leads to a relatively stable and high-margin recurring revenue stream, as 40% of Graco\u2019s sales come from aftermarket parts.", "description": "We've recently brought Graco under analyst coverage -- and we've awarded it a wide economic moat rating, to boot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blta49251caf8483084/5cb4f5163aebf35f29365ba8/ContentPackage_Portfolio_Scatter_1x1.jpg"}
