A Facebook post hinted that the killer was part of the incel movement, a mostly online community of men obsessed with their own \u201cinvoluntary celibacy.\u201d Last week, an interview transcript and video removed all doubt \u2014 the perpetrator claimed to be launching an \u201cuprising\u201d against attractive and average men because women refused to date him.\n\nBut the interview didn\u2019t just confirm what we already knew. It described an inchoate form of terrorism in a surprising way: not as isolated acts inspired by an internet echo chamber, but as something like an organized movement. With growing pressure to fight violent far-right movements based on racism and nationalism, incels are demonstrating more clearly than ever what a terrorist group motivated by gender looks like. And that could be completely intentional.\n\nThe interview took place soon after the attack, although it was only made public last Friday. Speaking with a detective, perpetrator Alek Minassian \u2014 who now faces multiple charges of murder and attempted murder \u2014 described a process of being \u201cradicalized\u201d by incel ideology online. He called himself part of an \u201cuprising\u201d or a \u201crebellion\u201d to overthrow society as it currently exists, all for the purpose of forcing women to \u201creproduce with the incels.\u201d\n\nThe claims are debatable, but the goal was terrorism\n\nMoreover, Minassian claimed (apparently without evidence) to have actively corresponded with at least two other mass murderers before their attacks, including Elliot Rodger, an incel who killed six people in 2014. \u201cWe were plotting certain timed strikes on society in order to confuse and shake the foundations, just to put all the normies in a state of panic,\u201d he said. Minassian\u2019s claims aren\u2019t publicly verified, but the goals he\u2019s describing mirror those of other violent far-right hate groups \u2014 which, over the past couple of years, have increasingly been kicked off web platforms and scrutinized by law enforcement.\n\nExtreme incels have been described as terrorists before. After the murders in Toronto, Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp wrote that Minassian \u201cwasn\u2019t taking revenge on a specific woman who wronged him; he wanted to instill terror in society writ large.\u201d The label was previously applied to Rodger, who fantasized about a mass movement that would kill huge numbers of women. And gender-based terrorism \u2014 attacks meant to instill widespread fear, not just kill individuals \u2014 has a much longer history. Canada\u2019s most deadly modern mass shooting, the 1989 massacre at Montreal\u2019s \u00c9cole Polytechnique, was aimed at keeping women away from science and engineering work.\n\nHistorically, it\u2019s been hard to make the \u201cterror\u201d label stick to misogynist violence, in part because that violence is so varied and so common. Many mass shooters, who are overwhelmingly male, have a history of violence against women; in fact, it\u2019s one of the most common traits among them. While most homicide victims are male, nearly half of women killed in the US over the past decade were murdered by male intimate partners, who are often motivated by mainstream gendered ideas about power and control \u2014 not extremist ideology. Drawing a line between those two things can seem almost futile \u2014 unless, that is, a group is actually trying to be seen as terrorists.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Minassian insists incels are: not only a unified, radical force with a common goal, but one with a leader who was supposedly trying to coordinate attacks. That\u2019s strikingly at odds with the standard narrative for all kinds of internet-inspired terrorism, let alone gender-based violence. Beauchamp, for example, described incels as a \u201cmutually supportive echo chamber\u201d with \u201cno centralized planning, no incel equivalent to of Osama bin Laden.\u201d Other far-right terrorists are often spuriously described as isolated \u201clone wolf\u201d killers who were inspired by propaganda. But Minassian portrays incels, or at least a subset of them, as an outright organized hate group \u2014 closer to the far-right group Atomwaffen than your average 4chan forum.\n\nIn some ways, the terrorism comparison is a poor fit. Incels aren\u2019t putting forward new ideas about gender. Like other parts of the \u201cmanosphere,\u201d a loosely defined group of male-supremacist subcultures, they build on existing ugly tropes about women \u2014 in their case, \u201cwomen are shallow and only date handsome jerks.\u201d And some go online just to commiserate with other lonely people.\n\nBut a highly visible subset of incels take their complaints to surreal and uniquely nihilistic extremes. Instead of simply complaining that lots of women won\u2019t date them, they posit that literally all women are viscerally disgusted by all men who don\u2019t meet an objective, universal, and ridiculously high standard of male beauty. They\u2019re monomaniacally focused on romantic relationships as the only worthwhile goal in life, and they resist basically any solution except forcible revolution. It\u2019s the kind of apocalyptic fundamentalism that you can find on a far larger scale in Islamist and white supremacist terrorist movements. While some posts are probably internet hyperbole, people like Minassian still act directly on their ideas \u2014 and are celebrated for it.\n\nIncels aren\u2019t coming up with new ideas about gender\n\nSome mainstream thinkers have echoed incel-like ideas. Self-help guru Jordan Peterson used Minassian\u2019s case to make an argument for vague and apparently non-forceful \u201cenforced monogamy,\u201d and Catholic New York Times columnist Ross Douthat invoked incels to score points against the sexual revolution. But even if you find Peterson or Douthat\u2019s ideas retrograde, there\u2019s still a huge gap between those viewpoints and extreme incels\u2019 fatalistic millenarianism \u2014 the same way there\u2019s a gap between condoning racial discrimination and wanting to imminently establish an all-white ethnostate.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve had trouble drawing these lines in other areas. Online groups like Atomwaffen can be identified and studied on their own, but the government has trouble when they intersect with racism in conventional politics. In the US, Republican politicians pushed the Department of Homeland Security to ignore far-right terrorism out of fear that it would demonize mainstream conservatism. Singling out fringe hate movements can also let people downplay harm from less extreme groups. Bigotry exists on a spectrum \u2014 and big, impersonal social structures can cause huge amounts of damage in their own way.\n\nBut violent fringe groups pose a specific kind of threat that\u2019s worth addressing. And while incels aren\u2019t a defined organization like a militia or a cult, they\u2019re a movement built around specific gathering places like the subreddit r/Braincels \u2014 which was banned a few days after the interview video was posted as part of a larger Reddit purge. These spaces aren\u2019t all hateful, but some clearly are irrevocably poisoned by violence, to the point of \u201cjokingly\u201d adopting Rodger as a saint. Combine these factors, and you get a distinct movement with an unusually radical belief system \u2014 not just a free-floating group of trolls or a simple reflection of offline sexism.\n\nMinassian almost certainly isn\u2019t offering an accurate portrait of what extreme incels are doing. Like other mass killers from internet hate subcultures, it can be hard to separate his attempts at irony from straightforward extremism or delusion. At one point he straight-facedly references Pepe the frog being \u201cworshipped quite frequently\u201d on 4chan, referring to a well-known forum meme. Minassian also offered no proof that he\u2019d corresponded with other killers. The claim could easily be self-aggrandizing mythmaking for Minassian specifically or the movement in general.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of self-aggrandizing mythmaking here\n\nBut incels\u2019 real violence and hateful rhetoric \u2014 amid an overall epidemic of mass shootings \u2014 may be having an effect. Minassian\u2019s video was released a few days after the US Army warned service members that incels might attack screenings of the film Joker, apparently based on a bulletin from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And that followed weeks of speculation that Joker would appeal to the subculture, since its protagonist is a socially outcast male loser who turns to violence. (Based on early reviews, the Joker is not an incel, just a broadly disaffected and isolated man.) Manosphere-tracking blog We Hunted The Mammoth documented some incels who were upset about being tarred as \u201cthe next ISIS.\u201d But that\u2019s exactly how Minassian describes them. It\u2019s definitely what Rodger \u2014 who urged fellow incels to \u201cstart envisioning a world where women fear you\u201d \u2014 wanted.\n\nMeanwhile, US and Canadian law enforcement face increasing pressure to treat domestic terrorism as seriously as they have groups like ISIS. The US Department of Homeland Security recently named violent white supremacy as a major security threat. This year, Canada added two far-right groups to its terror watchlist for the first time. The president of the FBI Agents Association has also asked Congress to make domestic terrorism a federal crime, which could be largely symbolic, but may still make investigating and prosecuting it easier. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Sen. Martha McSally (R-AZ) both proposed domestic terrorism bills in the wake of this summer\u2019s mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, which would make it far easier to crack down on ideologically extreme groups.\n\nIncels, again, don\u2019t seem remotely as powerful, organized, or numerous as far-right militias or members of a group like ISIS. But there\u2019s still every reason to treat them as an ideologically motivated extremist movement rather than lumping them in with broader \u201ctrolling.\u201d Among other things, it offers a clearer case for specifically deplatforming the most hateful parts of the movement \u2014 the way that sites like the Daily Stormer have been driven off many social media platforms, domain registrars, and payment processing services. It means less debate each time platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit consider banning accounts that deal in specifically incel-related misogyny. For a movement that exists almost entirely online, that\u2019s potentially a big deal.\n\nThis all ignores one huge question: do we actually want to define more kinds of hate as terrorism? The \u201cWar on Terror\u201d of the \u201800s gave rise to sweeping surveillance and torture programs. Law enforcement has gone after potential ISIS recruits with aggressive sting operations that may not actually make us safer. More generally, companies and policymakers have responded to mass shootings with exhaustive and debatably useful social media monitoring, and law enforcement has infiltrated activist movements along with hate groups. Urging them to heavily monitor internet subcultures like the incel movement could erode online civil liberties in the process \u2014 although based on the Army memo, that surveillance might be happening already.\n\nCalling anything \u201cterrorism\u201d is a fraught decision\n\nDeplatforming also raises real questions about how infrastructure companies should police content. You can leave Facebook and Twitter to start your own website, but domain registrars and DDoS protection services are low-level systems that can control whether any site stays online. To what extent do we want private companies making huge decisions about online speech with essentially no oversight? But we\u2019re already asking these questions about other kinds of hate content \u2014 adding incels to the list doesn\u2019t substantially change the conversation.\n\nSoon after Minassian\u2019s attack, Wired writer Nicole Kobie criticized \u201cbreathless\u201d and over-detailed coverage of incel terminology and beliefs. \u201cBecause violence against women inexplicably isn\u2019t seen as terrorism, such sites and their messages are viewed as mere curiosities,\u201d she wrote. She argued that the focus on incels amounted to \u201csuggesting men who violently hate women is an intriguing, new, internet-only trend\u201d rather than a familiar form of hate crime.\n\nStrangely, though, treating incels as a distinct phenomenon \u2014 whether that\u2019s a terrorist group, a hate movement, or something else \u2014 might help us parse the hugely complex problem of gendered violence. If Minassian wants to conjure the specter of a militant misogynist uprising, maybe we should take him at his word.", "description": "A new interview has confirmed that the incel movement inspired an attack in Toronto last year \u2014 making the group look more like an extremist movement than ever.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hd_egqGRgGKdJOX1-4mcThgLejI=/0x31:3888x2067/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19260624/1139007147.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
