The magic and joy were lost. The soundtrack hasn't had nearly the same impact in the charts that it had 25 years ago, when it was the bestselling album of the year.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: \u00c2\u00a92019 Disney Enterprises, Inc.

I wish I'd been invited to the party more, but the creative vision for the film and its music was different this time around and I wasn't really welcomed or treated with the same level of respect.\n\n\"That makes me extremely sad. I'm so happy that the right spirit for the music lives on withe The Lion King stage musical.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, he poured praise on fellow musician Lady Gaga.\n\nDiscussing what it takes to be a true music star, Elton said: \"To be a star, you have to be a star for a long time and you have to do that by being a live performer.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for Haus Laboratori)\n\n\"You can't be a star by just making records. That's not going to happen. To be a star, you have to last for 50 years. You have to be a Barbra Streisand. You have to be a Paul McCartney. You have to be Sting. You have to be Fleetwood Mac. You have to be The Who.\n\n\"Christine and the Queens, in my opinion, is a huge star, but she hasn't cracked it yet.\n\n\"The only real star at the moment is Lady Gaga. She could have a career like Barbra Streisand if she wanted to. She's got the ambition, she's got the talent coming out of every pore of her body, so it's up to her whether she wants it and I think she does want it.\"\n\nOn Ed Sheeran , Elton reckons \"he needs to broaden his one-man band thing,\" but also dished that Ed comes to him for industry advice.\n\nThe Rocketman singer also gushed over grime rapper Stormzy's Glastonbury performance: \"He's amazing and he was terrific at Glastonbury. It was a very hard thing for him to do and he came on and he killed it.\"", "description": "Elton composed the music for the original Lion King back in the nineties, but slammed the remake's musical scores", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "\u00c2 Disney Enterprises", "Inc.
