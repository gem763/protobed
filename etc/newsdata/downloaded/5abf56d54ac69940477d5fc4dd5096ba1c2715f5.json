That helped make up for a hit to Wall Street on Monday after attacks wiped out nearly half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production, sending oil prices soaring and fuelling geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe S&P 500 is less than 1% short of its record high close on July 26.\n\nInvestors were calmed after U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not want war and Saudi Arabia said it would restore its lost output by the end of September.\n\n\u201cPeople were thinking it would be months until we got that production back on line, and now it seems more like weeks. Putting that production back on line alleviates the risk of a higher disruption,\u201d said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta.\n\nThe S&P energy index .SPNY dipped 1.5% after recording its strongest one-day surge since January on Monday. The so-called defensive consumer staples .SPLRCS, utilities .SPLRCU and real estate .SPLRCR posted some of the biggest gains among the 11 major S&P sectors.\n\nOverall, nine sectors rose on Tuesday, with only energy and industrials .SPLRCI ending lower.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, where the central bank is expected to lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point, the second rate reduction of the year.\n\nInvestors will also wait for clues on how far the U.S. monetary policy easing would go, given that Fed policymakers are deeply divided on whether more rate cuts are warranted.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 17, 2019.
