Of that $4 trillion, over $3.3 trillion was financed by federal revenues. The remaining amount ($665 billion) was financed by borrowing. As the chart below shows, three major areas of spending make up the majority of the budget:\n\nSocial Security: In 2017, 24 percent of the budget, or $945 billion, paid for Social Security, which provided monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,404 to 42 million retired workers in December 2017. Social Security also provided benefits to 3 million spouses and children of retired workers, 6 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers, and 10.4 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents in December 2017.\n\nIn 2017, 24 percent of the budget, or $945 billion, paid for Social Security, which provided monthly retirement benefits averaging $1,404 to 42 million retired workers in December 2017. Social Security also provided benefits to 3 million spouses and children of retired workers, 6 million surviving children and spouses of deceased workers, and 10.4 million disabled workers and their eligible dependents in December 2017. Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and marketplace subsidies: Four health insurance programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace subsidies \u2014 together accounted for 26 percent of the budget in 2017, or $1 trillion. Nearly three-fifths of this amount, or $597 billion, went to Medicare, which provides health coverage to around 59 million people who are over age 65 or have disabilities. The rest of this category funds Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA subsidy and marketplace costs. In a typical month, Medicaid and CHIP provide health care or long-term care to about 69 million low-income children, parents, elderly people, and people with disabilities. (Both Medicaid and CHIP require matching payments from the states.) In 2017, 8 million of the 10 million people enrolled in health insurance through the ACA marketplace received subsidies that lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs, at an estimated cost of about $48 billion.\n\nDefense and international security assistance: Another 15 percent of the budget, or $611 billion, paid for defense and security-related international activities. The bulk of the spending in this category reflects the underlying costs of the Defense Department. The total also includes the cost of supporting operations in Afghanistan and other related activities, described as Overseas Contingency Operations in the budget, funding for which totaled $104 billion in 2017.\n\nTwo other categories together account for less than a fifth of spending:\n\nSafety net programs: About 9 percent of the federal budget in 2017, or $357 billion, supported programs that provide aid (other than health insurance or Social Security benefits) to individuals and families facing hardship. Spending on safety net programs decreased by $9 billion between 2016 and 2017 as the economy continued to improve. Safety net programs include: the refundable portions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, which assist low- and moderate-income working families; programs that provide cash payments to eligible individuals or households, including Supplemental Security Income for the elderly or disabled poor and unemployment insurance; various forms of in-kind assistance for low-income people, including SNAP (food stamps), school meals, low-income housing assistance, child care assistance, and help meeting home energy bills; and various other programs such as those that aid abused and neglected children. Such programs keep millions of people out of poverty each year. A CBPP analysis using Census\u2019 Supplemental Poverty Measure shows that government safety net programs kept some 36 million people out of poverty in calendar year 2017. Without any government income assistance, either from safety net programs or other income supports like Social Security, the poverty rate would have been 25.0 percent in 2017, nearly double the actual 13.9 percent. And these programs reduced the depth of poverty for millions more, even when not bringing them above the poverty line.\n\nInterest on debt: The federal government must make regular interest payments on the money it borrowed to finance past deficits \u2014 that is, on the federal debt held by the public, which reached $15 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2017. In 2017, these interest payments claimed $263 billion, or about 7 percent of the budget.\n\nAs the chart shows, the remaining fifth of federal spending supports a variety of other public services. These include providing health care and other benefits to veterans and retirement benefits to retired federal employees, ensuring safe food and drugs, protecting the environment, and investing in education, scientific and medical research, and basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and airports. A very small slice \u2014 less than 1 percent of the budget \u2014 goes to non-security programs that operate internationally, including programs providing humanitarian aid.\n\nWhile critics often decry \u201cgovernment spending,\u201d it is important to look beyond the rhetoric and determine whether the actual public services that government provides are valuable. To the extent that such services are worth paying for, the only way to do so is ultimately with tax revenue. Consequently, when thinking about the costs that taxes impose, it is essential to balance those costs against the benefits the nation receives from public services.\n\nAppendix\n\nBecause we discuss total federal spending, we do not distinguish programs financed by general revenues from those financed by dedicated revenues (e.g., Social Security). For more information, see Policy Basics: Federal Payroll Taxes.\n\nWe based our estimates of spending in fiscal year 2017 on the most recent historical data released by the Office of Management and Budget. (Federal fiscal year 2017 ran from October 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017.)\n\nThe broad expenditure categories presented in this paper were constructed on the basis of classifications commonly used by budget agencies. The categories are constructed by grouping related programs and activities into broad functions, which are further broken down into subfunctions. The details of how the categories used in this paper were constructed from those functions and subfunctions are described below.\n\nSocial Security:\n\nThis category consists of all expenditures in the Social Security function (650), including benefits and administrative costs.\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and marketplace subsidies:\n\nThis category consists of the Medicare function (570), including benefits, administrative costs, and premiums, as well as the \u201cGrants to States for Medicaid\u201d account, the \u201cChildren\u2019s health insurance fund\u201d account, the \u201cRefundable Premium Tax Credit and Cost Sharing Reductions\u201d and two other small accounts supporting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace subsidies (all in function 550).\n\nDefense and international security assistance:\n\nThe largest component of this category is the national defense function (050). In addition, this category includes the international security assistance subfunction (152) of the international affairs function.\n\nSafety net programs:\n\nThis category includes all programs in the income security function (600) except those that fall in the following two subfunctions: federal employees\u2019 retirement and disability (602) and general retirement and disability insurance (601). The latter contains the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and also covers programs that provide pension and disability benefits to certain small groups of private-sector workers.\n\nInterest on debt:\n\nThis category contains the net interest function (900).\n\nRemaining program areas:\n\nThis category includes all federal expenditures not included in one of the five categories defined above. The subcomponents of this category that are displayed in the graph are defined as follows:", "description": "In fiscal year 2017, the federal government spent $4 trillion, amounting to 21 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).
