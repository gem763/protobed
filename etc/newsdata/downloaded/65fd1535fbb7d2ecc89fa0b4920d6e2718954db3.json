The 31-year-old Czech has also played for the Florida Panthers, Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets.\n\n\u201cEight hundred, it\u2019s a special number and I was definitely excited for sure,\u201d Frolik said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t go better, to score on the second shift.\u201d\n\nAndrew Mangiapane also scored, and Elias Lindholm added an empty-net goal for Calgary, which snapped a two-game losing skid.\n\nDavid Rittich made 21 saves and improved to 3-2 on the season.\n\nDefenseman Matt Niskanen scored early in the third period as the Flyers closed within 2-1.\n\nBrian Elliott made 35 saves in his first start of the season for the Flyers.\n\nWith Elliott pulled for an extra attacker, the Flyers couldn\u2019t produce an equalizer in the final two minutes of regulation.\n\nElliott stopped Lindholm twice in the first four minutes of the third.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything positive to take from tonight\u2019s game, I would say it\u2019s the play of our goaltender Brian Elliott who played a really strong game,\u201d Flyers head coach Alain Vigneault.\n\n\u201cHe did what a goaltender is supposed to do, which is give your team a chance to win. He gave us a chance to come back in the third.\n\n\u201cWe definitely did not play the way we wanted to. We didn\u2019t execute and we didn\u2019t make any plays with the puck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have an opportunity to jump back tomorrow and do a better job.\u201d\n\nTravis Konecny fed Niskanen in the high slot from behind the net for Philadelphia\u2019s first goal of the game at 4:58.\n\nKonecny\u2019s assist was his seventh point in four games.\n\nThe Flyers opened their regular season in Prague against the Chicago Blackhawks and returned to Philadelphia for one home game before hitting the road again in Western Canada.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t seemed to affect us. Maybe it did tonight. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Niskanen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an ideal situation but I don\u2019t think anybody in here is going to use that as an excuse.\n\n\u201cWe just had two days off. We should be fresh, ready to go. We weren\u2019t good enough in the first two periods.\u201d\n\nTrailing by a goal, Philadelphia pressed early in the second period.\n\nRittich stopped Oskar Lindblom in the first minute and shut down James van Reimsdyk twice in the slot four minutes in.\n\nMangiapane made it 2-0 at 14:15. Flames captain Mark Giordano dished the puck to Mangiapane at the point, and his low knuckler beat Elliott on the stick side.\n\nFrolik scored at 1:35 of the first period. He knocked down a clearing attempt by Flyers defenseman Justin Braun and whipped the puck over Elliott\u2019s glove.\n\nNOTES: A Calgary goal with five seconds remaining in the opening period was waived off. Officials ruled Sean Monahan kicked the puck into Philadelphia\u2019s net.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlyers: Finish a three-game trip at Edmonton on Wednesday.\n\nFlames: Host the Detroit Red Wings on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Michael Frolik lost his helmet on his first shift and scored on his second.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/flyers_flames_hockey_96122_c0-396-4000-2729_s1200x700.jpg?de047d69be41c063e12b514b3add0b0768a7dd8c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
