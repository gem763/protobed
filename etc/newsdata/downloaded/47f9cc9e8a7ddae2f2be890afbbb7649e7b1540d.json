The couple claimed the right to create videos that are consistent with their faith beliefs about marriage between one man and one woman.\n\nEllison announced he will go back to trial to prove \u201cLGBTQ discrimination is not free speech,\u201d he said, as he accused the Larsens of using their faith beliefs as a front to be able to discriminate against LGBT individuals.\n\n\u201cBusiness owners\u2019 free speech and beliefs are already fully protected under the First Amendment,\u201d Ellison wrote. \u201cWhat they want is a license to discriminate against LGBTQ folks.\u201d\n\nEveryone deserves to live w dignity & respect but a St Cloud business wants a license to discriminate against LGBTQ folk & the 8th Circuit said that's ok. Appealing to SCOTUS right now is a trap so I'm going back to district court to fight for what's right https://t.co/25bVGl0BiU \u2014 Attorney General Keith Ellison (@AGEllison) October 2, 2019\n\nAccording to Ellison, the \u201cright to be free from discrimination in public\u201d is of greater value than religious liberty, though he also claims the First Amendment assures \u201cno law can\u201d tell people what they can believe.\n\nEllison claimed the Eighth Circuit panel is simply telling the Larsens and their video company, Telescope Media Group, \u201cit can hide behind \u2018free speech\u2019 to discriminate against LGBTQ couples.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not letting it go unchallenged,\u201d he asserted, but added appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court would not be a realistic option:\n\n[T]he current makeup of that court means we\u2019re not likely to win, because the court would have to accept Telescope\u2019s fairy tale as true, since there are no other actual facts on record at this early stage of the case. A loss there would make this kind of discrimination against LGBTQ people the law everywhere in America. Instead, the best path forward is to take the case back to federal district court. There, we\u2019ll be able to help the trial court establish a set of facts based in reality. Then, if it ends up on appeal again, including before the Supreme Court, the appellate courts will have to accept those facts as true, not Telescope\u2019s fanciful story.\n\nIronically, Ellison believes his path is one that keeps \u201chonoring the First Amendment, which allows everyone to believe what they want.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump will hold a Keep America Great rally in Minneapolis Thursday.
