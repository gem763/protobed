The Proud Boys are a far-right, self-identified \u201cWestern-chauvinist group\u201d that has provoked violence against anti-fascist protesters, leading to charges and assault convictions.\n\nCrisco said he and his chief deputy spoke with organizer Jeremy Bertino, who assured the sheriff that they were there peacefully and tried to help the district offset additional security costs, such as paying for optional parking. \u201cHe made it very clear they were not there to cause any type of violence,\u201d Crisco said of Bertino.\n\nBut Crisco acknowledged links to rally organizers and the Proud Boys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been brought to my attention, yes,\u201d he said of the connection.\n\nHow a MAGA sign and a high school cheer squad ignited a debate about free speech\n\nBertino and Thaxton did not return requests for comment. Thaxton had a Proud Boys graphic as his Facebook cover photo, the Stanly News and Press reported Thursday. The cover photo was changed to an image of a lighthouse hours later.\n\nAs of Saturday, Thaxton still had Proud Boy imagery on his Facebook page. He declined to tell the News and Press if he is an official member.\n\nCrisco said he did not change security plans at the high school after learning of a Proud Boys link to the demonstration.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what kind of a group it is. We\u2019re there to protect everybody,\u201d he said, describing protesters, counterprotesters, students and staff. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re singling out any single group.\u201d\n\nThe demonstration was still held, though it was a crowd of about 50 to 75 people, Crisco said, with \u201cno issues whatever\u201d stemming from the protest at a football game that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBecause the cheerleaders were in school uniforms when they posed with the Trump campaign sign at the Aug. 30 game, they were acting as representatives of the school, the school district said in a statement. The North Carolina High School Athletic Association administered the probation.\n\nThe district has received threats since then, Hope Miller, administrative assistant to the superintendent, previously told The Post. That puzzled district officials, she said; no student has been suspended or removed by the high school or the district following the picture\u2019s circulation.\n\n\u201cThey have all participated in every event since,\u201d she said, adding that the word \u201cprobation\u201d was probably not the best word for the warning against the students.\n\nMarilyn Que Tucker, the commissioner of the NCHSAA, said in a statement that the measure isn\u2019t a punishment.\n\n\u201cIt serves as a notice of behavior or action that is against NCHSAA Handbook Policy or contrary to expectations of sportsmanship and proper behavior that could bring additional sanctions, including penalties such as a fine or suspensions, should infractions persist,\u201d she said.\n\nLateshia Beachum contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Supreme Court said the Peace Cross can stay.
