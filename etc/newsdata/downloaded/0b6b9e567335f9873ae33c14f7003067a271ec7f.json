Heat waves are becoming more frequent globally. But how do we measure heat waves? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nStory Highlights The drought is affecting 45 million people in 14 states.\n\nThis week, most of the Deep South has been hotter than Death Valley.\n\nThe drought is cracking farm soil, drying up ponds and raising the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe South has endured a double whammy of blistering heat and a lack of significant rainfall over the past few weeks, triggering what climate experts are calling a \"flash drought.\"\n\nThe drought, which is affecting 45 million people in 14 states, is cracking farm soil, drying up ponds and raising the risk of wildfires.\n\n\u201cTypically we look at drought as being a slow onset, slow-developing type phenomenon compared to other disasters that rapidly happen, so this flash drought term came about,\u201d said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center. \u201cThe idea is that it\u2019s more of a rapidly developing drought situation compared to what we typically see.\u201d\n\nThe relentless summer heat is forecast to finally come to an end over the next couple of days in many areas of the Deep South, the culmination of a brutal stretch of temperatures more typical of mid-July than early October.\n\nFall foliage: Unusual warmth and dryness have delayed fall foliage across the country\n\nScores of records have been set this week with high temperatures soaring into the mid-to upper 90s from Texas to the Carolinas. In fact, from Tuesday through Thursday, 75 locations stretching from the Deep South to the Ohio Valley, eastern Great Lakes and Northeast either tied or set a new all-time October record high, the Weather Channel reported.\n\nA man sunbathes amidst patches of dried out lawn from a lack of rain in Atlanta, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019.

Phil Bryant said this week, as he ordered a statewide burn ban. Outdoor burning is also restricted in parts of several other states including Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and West Virginia, according to the drought center.\n\nThe drought was also affecting some water supplies across the region, including Georgia's Lake Lanier, which supplies much of Atlanta's water.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nYou may like: Lorenzo becomes the most powerful hurricane to make it so far east in the Atlantic\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/04/southern-united-states-flash-drought-wildfires-heat-wave-september-october/3856246002/", "description": "October has been so hot, it's bringing a 'flash drought' to the South, which raises the risk of wildfires.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Published A.M.
