Though not ebullient, they were more optimistic than at the same time a year ago. Given what\u2019s transpired in the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy in the past 12 months, that\u2019s perhaps not surprising.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte rings the bell for the new cabinet's first meeting at Chigi Palace in Rome, Italy September 5, 2019.\n\nIn a poll conducted at think tank The European House-Ambrosetti\u2019s forum in Cernobbio, the percentage of respondents expressing \u201csufficient\u201d to \u201cmedium\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d confidence in Italy\u2019s current situation and its prospects was 61%, up from 44% a year ago. True, more than third were still pessimistic, but that\u2019s the baseline in a country that has failed to keep up with global growth for 20 years.\n\nInvestors have been even more enthusiastic in their appraisal since early August, when the anti-immigrant and EU-sceptic League party pulled its support for the coalition it put together a little more than a year before. Though the League boss Matteo Salvini\u2019s decision to call for elections appeared designed to provoke a crisis, the move backfired. His former coalition partner, the quixotic 5-Star Movement, assembled a new government with the centre-left, led again by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. It should receive formal confirmation by the Senate on Tuesday.\n\nAs the process dubbed a coup by supporters of the League and a restoration by their opponents has unfolded, financial markets have reassessed their view of Italy. The FTSE MIB Index of the country\u2019s largest companies has gained nearly 10% in the past month, outpacing gains in German and U.S. stocks. The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year government bonds relative to the German equivalent has plummeted to around 150 basis points, from 238 basis points in August and a high of nearly 300 basis points over a year ago.\n\nYet Enrico Letta, a former prime minister who also led a coalition government five years ago, points out that \u201cwith a spread alone, you can\u2019t govern the country\u201d. Pulling together various forces that wanted to oust Salvini was the easy part, Letta told me in an interview for The Exchange podcast at the Ambrosetti shindig. Now comes the hard work of figuring out what this government actually hopes to accomplish.\n\nMoreover, while Salvini may appear a damaged figure, support for his party is still strong. Though it only has around 17% of the seats in parliament today, various polls suggest it would snag between 30% and 35% of the vote in a general election. That\u2019s in line with the group\u2019s showing in May\u2019s ballot for the European Parliament.\n\nThough Salvini\u2019s credibility has been tarnished \u2013 including by questions around his ties with Russia \u2013 the League\u2019s popularity means he will be lurking in the shadows and waiting for a comeback opportunity. The new government will need to act quickly to show it is grappling with some of the issues, including immigration, that Salvini used to gain support for his party beyond its northern Italian base.\n\nLetta ticks off a few of the economic priorities. The first, he says, is to re-establish better relations between Rome and Brussels. Salvini adopted a page from British campaigners for Brexit in castigating the home of the European Commission as Italy\u2019s primary nemesis. Negotiating some fiscal breathing room, principally to avoid a mandatory sales-tax hike while reducing the burden on working people, should be job one, he says.\n\nBut there are other measures that could make a difference. In recent years, Italy has lagged in making critical investments that could help growth and increase productivity, argues Carlo Cottarelli, a former director at the International Monetary Fund who was nearly named prime minister before last year\u2019s coalition government was formed. In a paper presented to the conference, Cottarelli calculated that Italy\u2019s gross domestic product would have grown by 0.6% more per year if commitments of public spending had remained constant with 2009 levels.\n\nHe estimates that by making up that shortfall in investment levels between 2020 to 2023, Italy can generate an incremental 108 billion euros of economic output, thereby reducing the country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio by 3 percentage points, to around 130%. That\u2019s still large by developed-economy standards. But the added growth would also help reduce unemployment in a country where one in three young people are out of work.\n\nEqually, Italy needs to do a better job of getting women into the workforce, improve its educational outcomes, reduce tax rates to incentivise labour and increase its digital penetration, argues Enrico Giovannini, an economics professor whose name surfaced in recent weeks as a possible technocratic candidate to lead the new coalition government.\n\n\u201cA country that does not know how to decide what its future should be and what role it can play in the world, risks being an unattractive country,\u201d he writes in the preface of the latest edition of the Global Attractiveness Index, which Giovannini unveiled over the weekend in Cernobbio. While Italy rose a notch in the rankings, it languishes at 16 out of 25 countries included in the survey.\n\nLike the increased confidence expressed by his fellow attendees, that\u2019s a slight improvement from the year before. But the work that lies ahead for Italy\u2019s new government, particularly given its fiscal constraints, makes it hard to share the market\u2019s cheery assessment. Salvini may have retreated from the public consciousness for now, but any sign that his successors are stumbling will bring him back with a vengeance.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Last weekend at the elegant Villa d\u2019Este hotel with its commanding view of Lake Como, an elite squad of Italian business leaders, investors and policymakers, including three former prime ministers, were asked for their view on the state of the country\u2019s affairs.
