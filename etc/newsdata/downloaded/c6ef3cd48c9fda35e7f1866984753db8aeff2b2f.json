A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said that if the legislation were to become law \"it wouldn't only harm China's interest in China-U. S. relations, but would also seriously damage U.S. interests\" and that China \"will definitely take strong countermeasures in response to the wrong decisions by the U.S. side to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\"\n\nSee:China vows 'strong countermeasures' in wake of U.S. bill supporting Hong Kong protesters (link)\n\n\"We think it's possible this bill will push China into a public show of defiance against U.S. 'interference,'\" which could mean a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note.\n\n\"Under that scenario, markets would be relieved if China's retaliation kept the trade pact intact. However, higher political uncertainty in Hong Kong would be a sizable downside risk,\" Lawler said.\n\n(link)In economic data, a report on U.S. September retail sales (link) missed expectations, falling for the first time in seven months.
