Photo: Alexander Shcherbak/TASS via Getty Images\n\nAfter formally announcing the opening of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Democrats intend to keep the investigation narrowly focused on Trump\u2019s request that the Ukrainian president do him a \u201cfavor\u201d by investigating his political rivals. But a Friday night report may force Democrats to rethink that plan: according to the Washington Post, during a 2017 meeting in the Oval Office with two top Russian officials, Trump said he was \u201cunconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries.\u201d\n\nTrump reportedly said this to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the already infamous May 10, 2017 meeting where he remarked that he\u2019d relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d by firing his \u201cnut job\u201d FBI director James Comey a day earlier, and shared highly classified information that exposed an Israeli counterterrorist operation.(Earlier this month, CNN reported that this prompted U.S. intelligence to extract a high-level intelligence asset from Russia over concerns that Trump\u2019s mishandling of intelligence would expose the spy).\n\nPretty much everything Trump has done and said regarding Russian election meddling \u2013 from constantly tweeting that the investigation into the matter was nothing but a \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d to suggesting in Helsinki that he trusted Vladimir Putin\u2019s denials over the conclusions of his own intelligence officials \u2013 has left the impression that the U.S. president truly does not care about Russian attempts to aid him in 2016. But Trump telling the Russians directly, in the Oval Office, that he\u2019s unconcerned about protecting the integrity of U.S. elections \u2013 and maybe implying that he wouldn\u2019t mind if they did the same in 2020 \u2013 elevates the matter to a new level. As the Post reports:\n\nWhite House officials were particularly distressed by Trump\u2019s election remarks because it appeared the president was forgiving Russia for an attack that had been designed to help elect him, the three former officials said. Trump also seemed to invite Russia to interfere in other countries\u2019 elections, they said.\n\nAs with the Ukraine scandal, Trump administration officials reportedly worked to conceal the records of his alarming remarks to the foreign officials. Three former officials told the Post that there was immediate concern about what Trump said in the meeting, prompting White House officials to limit access to a memo documenting the meeting to a small number of people with the highest security clearance. It\u2019s unclear if, like the transcript of the Ukraine call, the memo was also placed into a computer system meant to handle especially sensitive classified information. According to the Post, \u201cWhite House aides worried about the political ramifications if Trump\u2019s comments to the Russian officials became public.\u201d\n\nIn addition to contributing to the cascade of bombshell revelations fueling the impeachment push, this report raises several questions. First, why are we only learning about this element of Trump\u2019s Russia meeting now, months after the unspectacular end of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation? Second, what other appalling, potentially impeachable things did Trump say to other foreign leaders, and what did the White House do to conceal them?", "description": "During Trump\u2019s infamous 2017 Oval Office meeting with Russian officials Sergei  Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak, Trump reportedly said he was unconcerned about Moscow\u2019s 2016 election interference.
