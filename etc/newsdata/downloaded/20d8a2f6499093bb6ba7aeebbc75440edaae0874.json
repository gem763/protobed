How could I criticise you for being mouthy when it\u2019s the reason I hired you in the first place?\u201d Sharon gets a bit carried away but deep down she\u2019s got real affection for the shows,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018There will be other versions of these shows, I am sure, and she is always welcome back. If ever she had an issue, I\u2019d be on a plane in five seconds, she\u2019d do the same for me.\u2019\n\nLouis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Simon Cowell were the original judging panel (Picture: WireImage)\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, he added: \u2018I know that about her. There\u2019s absolutely no bad blood at all and I like I said, when people think I\u2019m annoyed with her, I\u2019m not!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s a good friend and always will be.\u2019\n\nThe pair have been through a lot together (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nSharon was first a judge on the show from 2004 to 2007 before making returns in 2013 and again from 2016 to 2017 but claimed she was sacked last year for being \u2018too old\u2019.\n\nThe talent show judge had been lined up for the 2018 series but \u2013 despite plans to have her appear as a fifth member of the panellist for the live shows \u2013 she released a statement shortly after the competition launched to say she\u2019d decided she was no longer needed in the role.\n\nSpeaking of her reason for turning down a spot on The Masked Singer, she said: \u2018I was signed on to do another show at the time. I was signed to go to England, and then Simon Cowell changed his mind and thought I was too old.\n\n\u2018Simon goes, \u201cShe\u2019s old. We need somebody young.\u201d So if you want young, fire yourself and get rid of those man t**s.\u2019\n\nLate last year Sharon took another swipe at music mogul Simon \u2013 who appeared alongside Louis Tomlinson, Robbie Williams and Ayda Field on the panel \u2013 as she blamed the X Factor boss for the show\u2019s ratings decline.\n\nShe said: \u2018Unfortunately, not out of malice, but I am only saying this because Simon\u2019s quote thinks it is funny, that the figures have dropped, and dropped and dropped through the course of the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am not saying it was all me at all, but [it\u2019s because of] his decision to change the show again and again and again.\u2019\n\nMORE: An American Horror Story themed Halloween party is coming to London\n\nMORE: Hailey Baldwin damages Justin Bieber\u2019s $200,000 car \u2013 and he calls her \u2018freaking cute\u2019", "description": "Simon Cowell and Sharon Osborne famously fell out when he failed to sign her up to The X Factor.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-75548816_1570273862.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
