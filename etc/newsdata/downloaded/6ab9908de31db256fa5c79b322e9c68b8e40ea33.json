There Is Nothing Funny About Sean Spicer Being on \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Oh look, a straight white man in a lime green monstrosity of a shirt and white pants takes to the dance floor!\n\nMy, he does it with a flourish of his arms. What fun!\n\nHis legs go this way and that. I never knew he would look like this!\n\nHe is smiling rapturously. He\u2019s having a ball!\n\nOh, the hilarity of a former high-profile representative of one of the most anti-LGBTQ administrations of modern times taking on the accoutrements of flaming camp! Thank you ABC, this will warm our winter evenings!\n\nThis is supposed to be the laugh-inducing cornerstone of Sean Spicer appearing in Dancing With The Stars. He is letting go all his inhibitions; finally, he has found an outlet for himself, to show more of himself than we knew him as in his previous incarnation.\n\nIf you don\u2019t watch Dancing With The Stars or its British variant Strictly Come Dancing or any one of its many other spawning international cousins, this is one of the repeat storylines.\n\nThe butch straight sportsman, the politics guy you\u2019d previously seen in a suit, are here made over in bright colors, sequins, and make-up to liberate themselves under the glittering disco ball. The basic storyline is: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d do anything like this. It\u2019s so much fun. See, I\u2019m so much fun, and not just that guy you thought I was.\u201d\n\nSpicer\u2019s d\u00e9but on Dancing With The Stars conforms to every one of the surface pantomimes, but with one major difference. Sean Spicer\u2019s previous incarnation was as something very serious (White House press secretary), and it is the way that he approached that job and soiled its importance and gravitas that then became its own joke\u2014but not of the haha variety.\n\nWhatever your view of Donald Trump, he has set the standard. He is the ultimate conflation and embodiment of politics, celebrity, and notoriety. His lesson to follow, which Spicer has to the letter: loom large on a screen, be a personality, say outrageous things, be a brand, get followers. Nothing else matters. Not the public good, not being a good and steady servant of the people. Just self-interest.\n\nAs Ryan Lizza noted in the New Yorker after Spicer\u2019s resignation in 2017: He began his tenure as Trump\u2019s press secretary \u201cwith a bizarre rant about how Trump\u2019s Inauguration audience \u2018was the largest audience to ever witness an Inauguration, period.\u2019 (It wasn\u2019t.)\u201d\n\nThe lies kept coming, as Lizza wrote: \u201cSpicer defended Trump\u2019s lie about how there were three million fraudulent votes in the 2016 election. He spent weeks using shifting stories to defend Trump\u2019s lie about President Barack Obama wiretapping Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nSpicer's press conferences infamously devolved into a toxic mixture of lies, bluster and confrontation; he baited the press, and insulted journalists at the behest of his boss. The gradual decline to almost-nothing of the White House press briefing, the attacks on the media, can be dated to Spicer\u2019s mangling of the job and his public responsibility.\n\nThis is what ABC is rewarding, this is what ABC is treating as a joke.\n\nSean Spicer got what he wanted; he is now a minor celebrity, his \u201cpersonality\u201d ennobled with a spot on Dancing With The Stars.\n\nSean Spicer lied to the American people. The American people paid Sean Spicer, and in return, as a public servant, he lied to them. Sean Spicer violated the trust of the American people for his own fame and venality. And now ABC is rewarding Sean Spicer for lying to the American people by giving him what he craves, a spot on a primetime entertainment show.\n\nCelebrity and infamy are the currencies here; and ABC and Spicer are involved in a hideous Paso Doble in maximizing Spicer\u2019s public image and presence.\n\nWhen it comes to Spicer\u2019s debut on Dancing With The Stars, only the lime green shirt is new; everything else Sean Spicer wore of himself loudly.\n\nIndeed, the day after his debut, thanking Mike Huckabee for his support and encouragement for people to vote for him, Spicer was back to playing in the familiar, whiny waters of the Trumpworld victim (who is absolutely not a victim), while trying to rig the votes in his own favor. \u201cClearly the judges aren\u2019t going to be with me,\u201d he said, asking supporters to vote for him, to send a message to Hollywood \u201cthat those of us who stand for Christ won\u2019t be discounted.\u201d\n\nThese are desperate, underhand tactics. But perhaps even Christian voters of the show won\u2019t vote for someone of Spicer\u2019s lack of dancefloor skills\u2014he got 12 out of 30 from the judges, the second lowest score of the night.\n\n\u201c Are there good liberals at ABC wringing their hands over Spicer\u2019s presence? Nah, not in key senior positions. It gets publicity. It gets buzz, and pieces like this written about it. Sean Spicer doesn\u2019t have any dignity to lose, so he\u2019s happy to sign up for it. He is trading on his own notoriety \u201d\n\nHuckabee himself said Spicer\u2019s success would lead to an \u201cemotional meltdown in Hollyweird.\u201d On the contrary, \u201cHollyweird\u201d only cares about ratings, and the first episode of the new season showed an uptick in viewers.\n\nAre there good liberals at ABC wringing their hands over Spicer\u2019s presence? Nah, not in key senior positions. It gets publicity. It gets buzz, and pieces like this written about it. Sean Spicer doesn\u2019t have any dignity to lose, so he\u2019s happy to sign up for it. He is trading on his own notoriety.\n\nHis lies don\u2019t matter now, his great public disservice doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s a personality, a celebrity; he\u2019s above all the muck and grime of politics. Now he\u2019s here, in the land of the mirrorball, where his appalling behavior can be fetishized and monetized, and made pretty for primetime.\n\nIn a fundamental sense, he is no different to his new buddy and fellow DWTS contestant Karamo Brown, of Queer Eye, who like most celebrities seems to just recognize and respond to more celebrity when he sees it\u2014and screw everything else.\n\nIt was Brown who babbled about Spicer being \u201ca good guy, really sweet guy\u201d when the contestants first met and then later, looking tweeted about forward to sitting\u201cdown w/ him and engage in a respectful conversations. Only way things get better is if we try to educate those who have different POV than us.\u201d\n\nBrown may want to remember that Spicer, no matter his employment status, is fronting for an administration that is doing all it can to roll back LGBTQ rights and equality, including the trans military ban and the Oct. 8 Supreme Court cases around LGBTQ discrimination\u2014discrimination which the Trump administration is determined to defend.\n\nBrown may want to bring that up in one of his happy-clappy, holistic sit-downs with Spicer. But again, celebrity and fame are what counts here; don\u2019t expect anything more substantial from Brown than dime-store new age philosophizing. He and Spicer can both commiserate over how unfair their critics are, how misunderstood they are, how you put yourself in the public sphere and, gah, it\u2019s all so toxic!\n\nLizza noted that \u201cSpicer\u2019s temper tantrums, ill-fitting suits, and mispronunciations turned him into a pop-culture sensation.\u201d That may be true, but it is also a terrible indictment; someone who abuses democracy and their role as a public servant in that democracy, and then parlays that abuse into a circus act and calling card for future TV gigs should receive at the very least hard questioning\u2014not a role on a sparkly dance competition.\n\nSpicer\u2019s presence on Dancing With The Stars is singularly unfunny, and as a parable of politics and celebrity culture it is a depressing lodestar. (Next, Kellyanne and George Conway to sign up to Couples Therapy?) Spicer\u2019s appearance in Dancing With The Stars, lime shirt and all, is no surprise. It is merely the most florid extension of the circus we watch every day on our dumb, ill-informed, vacuous, shouty circuses of news programs.\n\nEveryone in our politics and news business is involved in a scramble to make a name for themselves. Sarah Sanders now holds forth on Fox News. CNN talking heads are as familiar as sitcom characters.\n\nThere is a shamelessness that the age of Trump ushered in, which has sought to test what we, as viewers and consumers, find acceptable to watch and listen to. It is why bear-pit discussions and zinger put-downs go viral, and experts on climate change and stoic diplomats soberly explaining their subject areas get the snooze button.\n\nThat is why ABC tapped Sean Spicer to appear on Dancing With The Stars. He was magnificently terrible at what he did, so let\u2019s reward that. Let\u2019s have him on TV!\n\n\u201c Unless everyone at ABC has had their brains sucked out and replaced with glitter glue, there must be disgust over engaging in Spicer\u2019s services \u201d\n\nBut there is no joke, no eye-wink, and no irony here. How do you make light of the desecration of democracy that Spicer symbolizes? Well, ABC thinks you should dress it up in a lime green shirt and white pants. You don\u2019t call it what it is. You do not question it. You do not do your job, and safeguard what this person tried to destroy. You roll your eyes, treat it as a postmodern jape, and think of the ratings.\n\nUnless everyone at ABC has had their brains sucked out and replaced with glitter glue, there must be disgust over engaging in Spicer\u2019s services. One can only hope that all the LGBTQ members of staff on the show, and anyone else with a scintilla of decency and moral conscience backstage, asks Spicer what he thought he was doing as White House press secretary, and never lets him off the hook for a second. Ask him everything, all the time.\n\nIf host Tom Bergeron wants to do a job for all the people watching this show who paid Sean Spicer\u2019s salary for all that time\u2014for all that gaslighting and lying he did for the cameras for which he was so lucratively salaried\u2014then, when Spicer comes for the judges\u2019 scores, also interrogate him on his past, his job, and his record in public service.\n\nPut some grit on that mirrorball.\n\nObviously, Spicer\u2019s shtick will be to wear loud shorts and tight pants, and flame away, because for him this is both heterosexual playtime and a redemption storyline. Don\u2019t indulge it. Vote him off, and challenge his lack of humility, his hypocrisy, and his lies.\n\n\u201c Make Sean Spicer dance in all those ill-fitting, drab suits he used to lie to the American people in. Those White House podium appearances were also performances. So, let him wear on primetime TV to get applause and votes from us what he wore back then to get his applause from the president \u201d\n\nAnd to all those working in wardrobe at Dancing With The Stars, no more lime green shirts, no more tight pants, no more attempts at cheap sartorial ingratiation. Don\u2019t try to get us to laugh along with him.\n\nInstead, make Sean Spicer dance in all those ill-fitting, drab suits he used to lie to the American people in. Those White House podium appearances were also performances. So, let him wear on primetime TV to get applause and votes from us what he wore back then to get his applause from the president. Let us see this sneering clown in the clothes he is used to wearing\u2014the same clothes he began his shameless career in showbusiness in.", "description": "Sean Spicer lied to the American people.
