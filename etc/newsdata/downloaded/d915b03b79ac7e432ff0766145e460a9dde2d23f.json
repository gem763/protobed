I think if you feel you\u2019ve been targeted and betrayed [by] someone who pretends to be your friend and is supposed to be close to you, and you know they\u2019re peddling your secrets, that\u2019s very hurtful.\n\nNicola McLean hit out at Coleen Rooney (Picture: ITV)\n\nHowever, Nicola wouldn\u2019t let the issue lie, interrupting Vanessa to claim, \u2018she\u2019s used to being betrayed\u2019, before adding Coleen and Rebekah weren\u2019t close in the first place.\n\nColeen and husband Wayne haven\u2019t had the easiest time in their marriage, after it emerged the former Manchester United footballer had a threesome with two escorts in 2009 \u2013 when his wife was pregnant with their third child.\n\nHe was recently forced to hit out at claims he cheated once again, after he was pictured in a hotel lobby with a mystery woman.\n\n\u2018Nothing happened between me and any girl on that night in Vancouver,\u2019 he said at the time. \u2018I did not enter the lift alone with the girl pictured in the hotel foyer.\n\nColeen Rooney and husband Wayne share four children together (Picture: AFP)\n\n\u2018The girl pictured in the club was simply one of many who innocently asked for autographs and pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The whole story was a smear against me. It is damaging to my family and not something I am prepared to put up with.\u2019\n\nColeen made headlines this week after she dropped a statement on Instagram, accusing Rebekah of selling stories about her to the press.\n\n\u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories,\u2019 she wrote.\n\nRebekah Vardy denied all Coleen\u2019s allegations (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nThe post took on a life of its own, with WAGatha Christie trending on Twitter and memes taking over social media.\n\nRebekah \u2013 who is currently pregnant with her fifth child \u2013 hit back shortly after, denying all the claims and hitting out at her former pal for not contacting her first.\n\nShe also insisted she would be looking into who else had access to her Instagram page.\n\nThis Morning continues on weekdays, at 10.30am, on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
