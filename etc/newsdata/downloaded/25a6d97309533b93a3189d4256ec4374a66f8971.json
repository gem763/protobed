She grabbed clothing, photos hanging on her walls, her wedding album, jewelry, and at the last minute, 10 library books.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a book lover, I didn\u2019t want them to burn,\u201d said Marquez, who later realized she had left behind critical documents.\n\nThe fifth-grade teacher was one of an estimated 50,000 residents in the Santa Clarita area in southern California ordered to evacuate as the Tick fire burned more than 4,000 acres, destroyed homes and spread at a rapid pace on Thursday night. At a Red Cross center on a college campus 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, hundreds of evacuees anxiously waited on Friday for news of when they could return home \u2013 and if their houses were still standing.\n\nThe Tick fire was one of several major fires threatening California this week, as high temperatures and dangerous winds have created hazards up and down the state, leading to mass evacuations and preventive power shutdowns.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman covers her face as she run along Sierra Highway as the Tick fire burns in Canyon Country.

Holding her two small, barking dogs at the evacuation center, she said she had developed a routine when fleeing: grab photos of her children, their college diplomas, awards and other sentimental items. \u201cThis is life out here,\u201d she said.\n\nTaylor said she and her family did not consider the fire risk when they moved to the area and that this week\u2019s disaster was \u201cthe strongest wind we\u2019ve ever experienced, almost like we were in a tornado\u201d, adding: \u201cThe fire danger is getting more frequent. It\u2019s becoming less predictable. We are really considering, do we want to keep doing this? We\u2019re getting old.\u201d\n\nCalifornia wildfires: flames leave destruction across the state \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nShe noted that the region was also continuing to build new housing developments in the area, which is expected to exacerbate the fire crises. \u201cThat\u2019s scary. How bad can it get? I guess we will find out.\u201d\n\nNearby in the parking lot, Nancy Hilliard, 66, was trying to figure out what to do with her seven dogs and five cats she had evacuated the night before. She put her three great danes in cages and bought a large tent to try to give them shade, but the strong winds kept knocking it down.\n\n\u201cWe are blowing away,\u201d she said, as she and her daughter tried to fix the collapsing tent. She said she suspected her house would be fine, but she hadn\u2019t heard from a friend who lived very close to the fire.\n\nShe said she was trying to stay positive: \u201cI\u2019m not going to complain. This is where we live and this is what we have to deal with. I don\u2019t have any control over it.\u201d\n\nBy midday Friday, the fire had destroyed at least six homes, authorities said.\n\nFor Trish Bathory, 28, escaping the fire was a new experience. When the retail manager moved to California a year and a half ago, she was worried about earthquakes but had not considered the fire risks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it seems like there\u2019s a fire every week.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trish Bathory with Zeus. Photograph: Sam Levin/The Guardian\n\nHer dog, Zeus, was covered in ash from the fires: \u201cHe needs a bath.\u201d She was walking the husky around the parking lot, trying to tire him out, so that he might want to sleep. She hadn\u2019t been able to get any sleep since fleeing to the Red Cross center, which had taken in roughly 400 people and set up rows of cots in a gymnasium.\n\n\u201cI just want to know when I can go home and when I can go back to normal,\u201d said Bathory.\n\nSome recounted harrowing experiences of fleeing smoke, hot embers, and ash raining down and engulfing their neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIt was like I\u2019m in hell. Everything was orange,\u201d said Annick Tuluenga, 17, who fled with her family. \u201cIt just started coming closer and closer \u2026 then there was smoke everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe Tick fire, which was creating toxic air quality throughout the region, started about a mile from Charles Lindsey\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cThere was a wall of black smoke \u2026 then 20- to 30-foot flames,\u201d the 68-year-old said, adding that he tried to protect his home for hours but eventually decided to evacuate: \u201cEmbers in the wind will fly everywhere and do whatever the wind does \u2026 It was blowing straight at us. I saw the glow over the top of the hill.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hunter Cerda, left, with her mother, Sharell.

The utility company and Pacific Gas & Electric in northern California has faced intense scrutiny for their preventative blackouts, affecting more than half a million people. But Lindsey said he was not bothered: \u201cThey\u2019re damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t. They do what they have to do.\u201d\n\nWhile the fire got very close, Lindsey said he wasn\u2019t worried: \u201cThis is our climate \u2026 I\u2019m a California native. I\u2019ve been through fires.\u201d\n\nThe cause of the fire was unknown.\n\nSharell Cerda, a 57-year-old nurse, evacuated with her family and six dogs: \u201cWe have everything that\u2019s important to us here right now. Everything else can be replaced.\u201d\n\nHer daughter Hunter, 26, added that even if their home survived, she knew this wouldn\u2019t be the last time they went through this: \u201cWe are for sure going to catch fire again.\u201d", "description": "As the Tick fire rages, some residents take a stoic view of the perpetual threat.
