Newsweek said the operation took place in Syria's northwestern Idlib province and was carried out by special operations forces after receiving actionable intelligence.\n\nThe official did not disclose details of the operation and other U.S. officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley announced late on Saturday that Trump would make a \"major statement\" at 9 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nGidley gave no further details.\n\nThe president gave an indication that something was afoot earlier on Saturday night when he tweeted without explanation, \"Something very big has just happened!\"\n\nTrump has been frustrated by the U.S. news media's heavy focus on the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry, which he calls an illegitimate witch hunt.\n\nHe has also faced withering criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his U.S. troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America's Kurdish allies.\n\nTrump was expected to make the statement in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, which he has used to make a number of major announcements.\n\nJust last week he used the same room to announce that a ceasefire between Turkey and the Kurds had taken hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Phil Stewart and Steve Holland; Editing by Lincoln Feast)", "description": "The U.S. military conducted an operation against elusive Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Saturday, a U.S. official said, as U.S. President Donald Trump prepared to make a \"major statement\" at the White House on Sunday morning.
