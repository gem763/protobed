There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThough the president himself has spent moments of the impeachment crisis announcing his intention to commit high-crime offenses on the White House lawn, Trump did not like Mulvaney\u2019s public admission. \u201cHe was not happy,\u201d an administration source told CNN. Nor were White House lawyers or Trump\u2019s personal legal team; his personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, quickly issued a note saying that he \u201cwas not involved in the Acting Chief of Staff\u2019s press briefing.\u201d Later that day, Mulvaney walked the statement back, to limited effect. (Fellow administration members were also hesitant to come to his side: \u201cI will leave to the chief of staff to explain what it is he said and what he intended,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.)\n\nIn his appearance on Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney did his best to not fall into the same fiasco of truth-telling, dodging as Chris Wallace tried to get him to repeat his claim from October 17 that there were three reasons for withholding aid to Ukraine: \u201cthe corruption in the country, whether or not other countries were participating in the support of the Ukraine, and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice.\u201d On Fox News, Mulvaney attempted to cut out that third reason \u2014 that military aid was dependent on Ukraine investigating an effort by a Democratic operative during the 2016 election to learn more about Paul Manafort\u2019s dealings in the country.\n\nMulvaney: \u201cI\u2019m not acknowledging there were three reasons.\u201d Wallace: \u201cYou said three reasons.\u201d Mulvaney: \u201cI recognize that.\u201d\n\n\"You said what you said!\" - absolutely BRUTAL grilling of Mulvaney by Chris Wallace on quid pro quo. pic.twitter.com/eqHkRZlbM5 \u2014 Tommy X-TrumpIsARacist-opher (@tommyxtopher) October 20, 2019\n\nAccording to a report from CNN, the botched quid pro quo admission may not be the only job stressor in Mulvaney\u2019s role as acting chief of staff: Prior to the impeachment crisis, aides for Jared Kushner had feelers out for two potential replacements. At least the ex-wonk is most likely secure in his other full-time gig, as director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "description": "In an appearance on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney pretended he never said Trump withheld aid in exchange for an investigation into Democrats in Ukraine \u2014 as video played of him saying just that.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/14/mick_mulvaney.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
