(AP) \u2014 Hendon Hooker threw three touchdown passes and Virginia Tech fought back feisty Rhode Island for a 34-17 victory Saturday.\n\nHooker hit Damon Hazleton from nine and 37 yards in the first half and Dalton Keene from three yards after the Rams pulled to within 17-14 in the third quarter. The Hooker-to-Hazleton connection almost teamed up for a third first-half score, but Hazleton dropped what looked like a sure 71-yard scoring pass before halftime. His scoring toss to Keene was his fourth to the tight end in the past two games.\n\nVirginia Tech (4-2) won its second in a row, but without showing the firepower that marked a 42-35 victory at Miami a week ago in Hooker's first start. The Hokies were stopped on three consecutive runs after having a first down at the Rams' 5 yard-line on their opening possession, having to settle for a field goal, and need a 75-yard scoring drive early in the final quarter to get some insurance points.\n\nThe Rams (1-5) fell to 1-18 against Football Bowl Subdivision schools, but not before putting a scare into the crowd at Lane Stadium. They needed just 2:34 after taking the second-half kickoff to drive for their lone touchdown, a 9-yard pass from Vito Priore to Ahmere Dorsey. A 2-point conversion made it a three-point game, but Hooker drove the Hokies 93 yards to Keene's touchdown on the next series.\n\nHooker finished 16 of 27 for 261 yards. He also ran 15 times for 43 yards.\n\nA scoring run by Deshawn McClease pushed the margin to 14 points. Brian Johnson kicked a pair of 22-yard field goals.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nRhode Island: Rams coach Jim Fleming admitted this week the game was as much about a payday for his program as anything, but they did some things that suggest things may improve when they go back to playing competition at their level. In Aaron Parker and Isaiah Coulter, they have two top quality receivers, and Priore was solid against the Hokies, completing 26 of 47 for 286 yards.\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies were more impressive on offense at Miami last week, but Hooker had as many completions \u2014 10 \u2014 by halftime as he had all game against the Hurricanes, and he did it in five fewer attempts. The return of Hazleton to form will continue to provide a huge boost to the Hokies' passing game, but he had a moment late in the first half he'd like to have back: he dropped a nicely thrown ball from Hooker that likely would have been a 71-yard scoring play.\n\nTARGETING\n\nThe Hokies will be without rover Reggie Floyd for the first half of next weekend's game against North Carolina after the senior was called for targeting for a hit on Coulter early in the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rams return to CAA competition next Saturday, facing Albany in Upstate New York.\n\nThe Hokies remain at Lane Stadium to face Coastal Division rival North Carolina next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hank on Twitter: www.twitter.com/hankkurzjr\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
