Get a better candidate this time, you\u2019ll need it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nAs Cortney reported earlier, Pelosi compared the impeachment of President Trump to the American Revolution and Schiff repeatedly invoked the Founding Fathers to justify his latest fishing expedition.\n\nAbsolutely bonkers.\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi compares impeaching @realDonaldTrump to the American Revolution.\n\n\n\nDisgraceful. pic.twitter.com/IaT36ZE35T \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) October 2, 2019\n\nLast week Schiff lied to the American people and entered false testimony into the congressional record during a hearing with Acting DNI Director Joseph Maguire. Ever since, President Trump has continued to bring attention to his words, wondering why he isn't being punished for doing so. He's aslo repeatedly called for his resignation.", "description": ".10/03/2019 3:15:08AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/94ef4db4-8ee4-40a4-981c-ff548bdaceb4.png"}
