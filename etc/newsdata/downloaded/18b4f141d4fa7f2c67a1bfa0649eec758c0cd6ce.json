In the case of the soon-to-be-ex-Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Dennis Bonnen, his sin is far graver: He plotted against members of his own party, then went over the brink by disrespecting Donald J. Trump. The Texas Tribune explains:\n\nFirst-term Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced Tuesday he will not seek reelection to the lower chamber in 2020 \u2014 completing a stunning fall for the Angleton Republican who enjoyed near unanimous support in the House just months earlier \u2026\n\nBonnen\u2019s political future was first called into question in late July, when hard-line conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan, who heads the group Empower Texans, revealed that Sullivan, Bonnen, and one of the speaker\u2019s top allies had met at the Texas Capitol the month before. At that meeting, Sullivan alleged, Bonnen and state Rep. Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, suggested Empower Texans go after a list of 10 House Republicans and told Sullivan his group could have media access to the lower chamber in 2021. Bonnen also disparaged multiple Democrats, calling one \u201cvile\u201d and another \u201ca piece of shit,\u201d and said his goal for the next legislative session is to make it the worst \u201cin the history of the legislature for cities and counties.\u201d\n\nAfter a lot of back-and-forth and name-calling, Sullivan released a near-hour-long tape of the meeting, which documented his allegations. Pretty much everyone in Texas politics had reason to be offended by Bonnen\u2019s arrogant ramblings. But the cherry on top of the rancid sundae of his remarks is a comment about POTUS, as reported last week by the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cI just think we\u2019ve got to get through 2020, guarantee if we try and hold this majority \u2014 which, with all due respect to Trump, who I love by the way \u2014 he\u2019s killing us in the urban-suburban districts,\u201d Bonnen says in the recording, according to the transcript.\n\nBlasphemy!\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the tape came out during preparations for a big Trump rally in Dallas.\n\nBonnen\u2019s immediate future is unclear; the Texas House is not in session and isn\u2019t scheduled to return until January 2021, when he will no longer be in office. Even as Republicans jockey to replace him, their bigger problem is that they are in danger of losing control of the chamber next November thanks to the very Trumpian phenomenon Bonnen was incautious enough to mention out loud.\n\nIf citing well-established political facts about Trump is deemed scandalous, it\u2019s a sign of how far Republicans in Texas and elsewhere will have to come before even thinking about abandoning their warlord.", "description": "Republican Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen has announced his retirement after a secret tape came out in which he foments intraparty warfare, then commits the ultimate blasphemy of admitting that Donald Trump is hurting Republicans in the state.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/23/23-dennis-bonnen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
