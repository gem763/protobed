When asked what childhood dish was my favorite, I\u2019d stammer and come up empty. And then, walking down the stairs in my Paris apartment, I got to the third floor and said out loud to no one: baked apples! My mother made baked apples. Her apples were big Cortlands or Rome Beauties, and she cored and stuffed them with raisins, because my father loved raisins. I also bake with Cortlands or Romes when I can get them, Fujis or Galas when I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll often stuff them with raisins, but I think they\u2019re especially nice filled with bits of dried apple and candied ginger. And I like to baste them with apple cider and honey. They\u2019re good hot or cold, but best served warm and topped with something creamy. Cinnamon (my mom always used too much) is optional.\n\nFeatured in: My Mother\u2019s Best (And Only) Recipe: Baked Apples.", "description": "I don\u2019t remember my mother at the stove When asked what childhood dish was my favorite, I\u2019d stammer and come up empty And then, walking down the stairs in my Paris apartment, I got to the third floor and said out loud to no one: baked apples", "authors": ["Dorie Greenspan", "Joan Nathan", "Samantha Seneviratne", "Molly O'Neill", "Glenn Collins", "Melissa Clark", "Alison Roman", "Ali Slagle", "Margaux Laskey", "David Tanis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/magazine/22mag-eat/22mag-eat-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
