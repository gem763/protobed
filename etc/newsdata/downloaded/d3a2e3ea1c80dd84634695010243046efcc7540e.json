(NYSE:AJG) Is A Top Dividend Stock", "language": "en", "text": "Dividend paying stocks like Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (NYSE:AJG) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason - some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nA 1.9% yield is nothing to get excited about, but investors probably think the long payment history suggests Arthur J. Gallagher has some staying power. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Arthur J. Gallagher!\n\nNYSE:AJG Historical Dividend Yield, October 22nd 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Arthur J. Gallagher paid out 45% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Arthur J. Gallagher's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Arthur J. Gallagher has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$1.28 in 2009, compared to US$1.72 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 3.0% per year over this time.\n\nDividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. It's good to see Arthur J. Gallagher has been growing its earnings per share at 12% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that Arthur J. Gallagher has a low and conservative payout ratio. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Arthur J. Gallagher fits all of our criteria, and we think there are a lot of positives to it from a dividend perspective.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Dividend paying stocks like Arthur J.
