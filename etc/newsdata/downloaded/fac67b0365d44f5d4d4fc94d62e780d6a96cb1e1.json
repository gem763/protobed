The trade represented a $1.89 million bullish bet.\n\nWhy It's Important\n\nEven traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.\n\nMany of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.\n\nUnfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there\u2019s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of Thursday\u2019s Square option trade it could easily be institutional hedging.\n\nSquare Earnings Setup\n\nWith Square earnings due out on Nov. 6, the strike price of the calls purchased on Thursday suggests more than 4% upside given their breakeven price is $66.02.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts have commented on the volatile stock heading into earnings season. Susquehanna upgraded Square earlier this month and set a $77 target for the stock. The firm is bullish on the company\u2019s recent investments in its ecosystem, including its Cash App.\n\nNot all analysts are as optimistic about the investments. Nomura Instinet has a $49 price target for Square and said this month investors can expect those heavy investments to eat into the company\u2019s margins in the near-term.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nAs with many other growth stocks, upside for Square will continue to hinge on whether or not the company can grow its business at a high enough clip to justify its valuation. Last quarter\u2019s 44% revenue growth would have been a blowout quarter for almost any other company. But with Square stock up 470% overall in the past three years, market expectations are extremely high.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
