The polls for this town hall must have been released between June 28, 2019 and September 25, 2019. In addition, candidates also needed to meet the donor threshold outlined by the DNC for the October debate, in which the candidates had to receive the financial support of 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors each from at least 20 states. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and businessman Andrew Yang both declined HRCF\u2019s invitation, each citing scheduling conflicts. A HRCF (Human Rights Campaign Foundation) spokesperson said the audience will be comprised of invited guests, LGBTQ stakeholders, and members of civic organizations. No public tickets will be available for the event.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "CNN and the Human Rights Campaign are hosting a town hall with nine Democrat presidential candidates on Thursday, focused on LGBT issues.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/pride-flag-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
