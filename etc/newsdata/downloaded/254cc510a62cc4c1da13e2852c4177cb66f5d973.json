The next morning, Dylan Lepore, the paper\u2019s 21-year-old editor, noticed that several stands were empty. That wasn\u2019t normal. Soon he learned that papers were gone from 22 stands. About 1,000 papers had disappeared. Most of the stands that still had papers were in locked buildings that were not easily accessible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened to the missing papers remains a mystery. What is known is that administrators at the state university \u2014 which has an enrollment of about 8,000 undergraduate students \u2014 were concerned about a photo that ran on the front page accompanying the story about Tibbetts. The photo, which was provided to the newspaper by Tibbetts\u2019s wife after his death, showed Tibbetts and his high-school-age daughter smiling and standing underneath a small street sign that read \u201cTibbetts St. Dead End.\u201d\n\nLepore said when he saw the photograph he \u201cthought it was sweet \u2014 just a really nice photo of Tibbetts and his daughter.\u201d\n\nThe day the papers disappeared, administrators emailed Lepore and asked him to come in for a meeting. The email did not say what would be discussed.\n\nAD\n\nAt the meeting the next day, Lepore said he was told by administration officials \u2014 including Susan Trageser, Radford\u2019s vice president for student affairs, and Ashley Schumaker, vice president for university relations \u2014 that they had received complaints about the photo of Tibbetts. Lepore said he was told that the photo was \u201cnot the best choice\u201d and that the stories could \u201ctrigger\u201d people.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI told them people are not going to like everything we publish, and we\u2019re not going to please everyone,\u201d Lepore said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard topic, and it\u2019s unfortunate that it happened, but it\u2019s our obligation to tell these stories.\u201d\n\nIn a statement emailed Friday to The Washington Post, Caitlyn Scaggs, associate vice president for university relations, said that during the meeting, \u201cit was noted that, for those grieving, the photo, even if shared with the best of intentions on the part of The Tartan, could have resulted in a range of emotions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLepore said administrators asked him and the newspaper\u2019s faculty advisers, Leigh Anne Kelley and Geoff White, how the administration could help the paper and proposed sitting in on the publication\u2019s weekly meeting.\n\nIn an interview, Lepore said that he welcomes advice but that he and the paper\u2019s advisers told the administrators they should not sit in on the weekly meetings and cautioned them against establishing any system of prior review by the administration of articles in the publication. The meeting ended amicably, Lepore said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe meeting was structured to determine ways in which the University can strengthen its partnership with the student newspaper, including the offer to establish regular meetings to share University updates and pitch story ideas,\u201d Scaggs told The Post in an email Thursday. \u201cThe University did not suggest and will not be requesting prior review of any student media, including The Tartan.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the days since the meeting, Lepore and his staff of 19 student journalists have been trying to find out what happened to the papers. Lepore said he has given his staff one directive: \u201cDon\u2019t speculate at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone on campus has ideas about what happened or who took them,\u201d Lepore said. \u201cI have no opinion on what happened until I have all the facts.\u201d\n\nIn a Sept. 24 email to Tartan reporter Jeremy Moser, Schumaker said the university doesn\u2019t have any information about what happened to the papers and \u201cdid not orchestrate and/or participate in the removal of any newspapers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, Scaggs responded to a Post inquiry asking if anyone in the administration or any Radford employee ordered or personally removed the copies of the paper that went missing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe administration did not order or remove copies of The Tartan,\u201d Scaggs wrote. \u201cThe Radford University Police Department is reviewing this matter and seeking to determine any independent involvement by students, faculty or staff.\u201d\n\nLepore has sent Freedom of Information Act requests to the university police department to obtain surveillance video of the buildings where the paper\u2019s distribution boxes are located.\n\nHe took over as editor of the Tartan in his freshman year and has run it ever since, often spending more than 25 hours a week in the office \u2014 and occasionally sleeping there \u2014 to make sure it publishes on time and is available to his fellow students.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get too emotional,\u201d Lepore said, \u201cbut when you put all your blood, sweat and tears into this and then someone steals all your newspapers, that kind of hurts.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Hundreds of copies of the Tartan went missing.
