The decision ensures Erdo\u011fan will face no consequences for its invasion of northeastern Syrian areas previously held by Kurdish forces fighting alongside the United States.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where this residual force of U.S. troops will be stationed or what local partner they will have. The U.S. military command, which has been taken by surprise by a wrenching month of withdrawal decisions, did not immediately respond to comment. The other enduring U.S. base in the war-torn country, known as al-Tanf, is in the southeastern Syrian desert, far from the oil fields and pipelines that Trump claimed as the residual mission for the U.S. in Syria.\n\n\u201cWe will be deciding what to do with [the oil] in the future,\u201d Trump declared. Using U.S. forces to claim another nation\u2019s oil is likely to prompt backlash, though it is unclear whether Trump\u2019s pronouncements, an echo of his campaign rhetoric, will translate to actual American policy.\n\nAfter Trump gave Erdo\u011fan a green light to invade on Oct. 6, the administration, facing substantial political opposition, has attempted after the fact to portray itself as opposing the incursion. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence and other senior administration officials in Ankara announced a ceasefire that ratified all of Turkey\u2019s military goals: clearing the Kurds out of a 20-mile-deep area away from the Turkish border. The vice president said that while the ceasefire held, the Turks would enjoy a reprieve from the sanctions the U.S. placed on Turkey post-invasion.\n\nTrump claimed victory out of the five-day durability of the ceasefire, something that resulted from a deal reached Tuesday by Erdo\u011fan and Putin for joint Turkish-Russian patrols in an area that effectively redraws the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nYet Trump presented this fait accompli as \u201can outcome created by us, the United States, and no other nation.\u201d He praised Erdo\u011fan as \u201ca man I have gotten to know very well\u201d and referenced an invitation to the White House that he first extended to his Turkish counterpart days before the offensive began.\n\nIt was not the only unreality in Trump\u2019s brief speech. He claimed all ISIS fighters had been recaptured, said the U.S. has been in Syria for \u201calmost ten years\u201d instead of the four years it has been there, portrayed the conflict between Kurds and Turks as ancient instead of political and glossed over the horrific scenes of violence against Kurds that resulted from the Turkish invasion.\n\nTrump\u2019s posture on Wednesday was to wash his hands of whatever ISIS resurgence results.\n\n\u201cNow Turkey, Syria and others in the region must work to make sure ISIS doesn\u2019t regain any territory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s their neighborhood.\u201d\n\nEven though he made no effort to explain when the new, plunder-driven goals of the U.S. in Syria will be satisfied, permitting an actual withdrawal, Trump contended that he had reoriented the U.S. military out of a generation of conflict in the Middle East that has agonizingly produced neither peace nor victory.\n\nWith \u201ca clear objective, a plan for victory and a path out of conflict,\u201d Trump said, the U.S. will now \u201conly win\u2014our whole basis has to be the right plan, we will win, no one can beat us.\u201d", "description": "U.S. troops will now stay in northeastern Syria\u2014not to fight ISIS, but to plunder oil.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2880,w_5120,x_0,y_42/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571848134/RTS2SHNI_m2k2ga", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
