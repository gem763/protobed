Gasparotto rose above the crowd to put the ball in the net with a header for his first CPL goal.\n\nJust over ten minutes later, Rodrigo Gattas extended York9's lead, capitalizing on a deflection in the six-yard box to make it 2-0 in the 21st minute.\n\nShortly after, Telfer found a goal of his own after Simon Adjei spotted him in acres of space on the edge of the box. Telfer took the ball, scoring with a clean finish along the ground to make it 3-0 in the 31st.\n\nWATCH | York9 defeat Edmonton FC:\n\nYork9 FC moves into a tie for 3rd place with a 3-1 victory over FC Edmonton. 1:02\n\nThe Eddies finally got one back in the second as Easton Ongaro broke FCE's 335-minute goalless streak, deflecting a long-range shot past Y9 keeper Nathan Ingham in the 65th minute.\n\nValour, Wanderers share spoils\n\nChances came but goals did not for Valour FC or HFX Wanderers FC Saturday afternoon at a jammed-packed Wanderers Grounds in Halifax, with both sides ending proceedings even for the first time over seven tilts this season.\n\nBoth clubs combined for 12 shots on goal, many half-chances, but proceedings remained scoreless right to the final whistle.\n\nValour's first clear-cut chance came with controversy at Wanderers Grounds after a half-hour of play. Ali Musse, capitalizing on a defensive mishap, went down in the box while attempting to strike the ball, leading to penalty appeals.\n\nMusse's chance highlighted a scoreless-yet-cagey first half, with the two sides meeting for the final time in 2019.\n\nWATCH | The full HFX Wanderers vs. Valour FC match:\n\nHFX Wanderers FC host Valour FC in Halifax. 2:14:32\n\nTeams exchange late scoring chances\n\nValour continued a particularly fruitful day in front of goal in the second frame, cutting through HFX's midfield line often. Similarly, HFX also enjoyed half-chances at the other end, specifically with Thomasz Skublak, who arrived as a second-half substitute.\n\nHFX started to find extra breakthroughs after 80 minutes, with Mohamed Kourouma finding touches inside the box several times.\n\nA pair of late chances from Marco Bustos, including a speculative late bicycle kick, tipped over the bar by HFX goalkeeper Christian Oxner, marked the final decent chances of the match.\n\nValour will have a little time off before their next match, as they visit Spruce Meadows to take on Cavalry FC on Oct. 2, while Halifax hosts FC Edmonton on Sept. 28.", "description": "York9 FC took care of business early, scoring a trio of first-half goals to beat FC Edmonton 3-1 at home on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292917.1569102354!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/york9-eddies-092119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
