It wasn\u2019t until 18 months later that Lenny found out the man he worked for every Friday, was actually his biological father.\n\nLenny admits he once felt \u2018ashamed\u2019 by the truth but has now decided to \u2018own it\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian, Lenny said: \u2018My story is an immigrant story. My story is of people moving from one country thousands of miles away to another and forming new links, new family and new relationships.\n\n\u2018And that\u2019s just what it is. It\u2019s not illicit, it\u2019s not salacious in any way. It\u2019s a life thing.\u2019\n\nThe comedian\u2019s autobiography is out now (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nLenny\u2019s relationship with his mother was a tumultuous one as he reveals how he was beaten throughout his childhood.\n\nBefore Winifred\u2019s death in 1998, Lenny recalls how she changed once he became famous.\n\n\u2018I felt that she was buying into the showbiz story and she was changing. Why was she changing? This is the woman who, up to five minutes ago, would backhand me or beat me or whatever, and now she\u2019s calling me Lenny instead of Len,\u2019 he said.\n\nLenny details his childhood and rise to fame in his new autobiography, Who Am I, Again? and reveals how he used to make bullies laugh even after being called the n-word.\n\nThe TV star writes: \u2018For a brief period, I\u2019d have a fight every single day with this kid.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019d say hateful things like, \u201cHey d**, hey n*****.\u201d Every day, the same greeting as usual.\n\nLenny\u2019s new autobiography, Who Am I Again? is out now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
