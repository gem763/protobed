Good Days agreed to pay $2 million while PAN Foundation agreed to pay $4 million. Neither admitted wrongdoing.\n\nGood Days in a statement said the settlement will allow it to concentrate on providing help to people in need of life-saving medications. PAN said the settlement involved \"legacy matters\" rather than its current operations.\n\nDrug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government's Medicare healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.\n\nBut the government has alleged that various drugmakers have used charities like Good Days and PAN as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\nThe department said Good Days, previously known as the Chronic Disease Fund, from 2010 to 2014 conspired with companies including Novartis AG, Astellas and Questcor, now owned by Mallinckrodt Plc, to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their drugs.\n\nThose drugs included H.P. Acthar Gel, an expensive treatment for a rare infant seizure disorder and multiple sclerosis that is subject of a related lawsuit by the government against Mallinckrodt over Questcor's donations to the charity.\n\nThe Justice Department said Questcor from 2010 to 2014 used the charity as a conduit to improperly subsidize patients' copays, allowing it to keep raising prices for Acthar, whose price increased from $50 per vial in 2001 to $32,200 in 2014.\n\nMallinckrodt declined to comment. It has said it believed its actions were lawful.\n\nPAN similarly permitted Bayer AG, Astellas, Dendreon Pharmaceuticals and Amgen Inc to use it as a conduit to pay patients kickbacks, according to the government's allegations.\n\nAstellas and Amgen in April agreed to pay $100 million and $24.75 million, respectively, to resolve related claims.\n\nDendreon said it takes compliance seriously. Novartis declined to comment. The other companies' representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Chris Reese and Grant McCool)", "description": "Two charities will pay $6 million to resolve claims they operated as pass-throughs for seven pharmaceutical companies to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their high-priced medications, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday.
