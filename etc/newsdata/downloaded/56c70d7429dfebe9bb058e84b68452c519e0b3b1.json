I couldn't see what had happened. We were asking and they told us but you cannot change things.\"\n\nOthers of a Liverpool persuasion didn't take things as lightly though.\n\n\"I've seen the goal played back I don't know how many times now and you look at the reactions on different peoples' faces,\" Bent told Sky Sports recently.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Pepe Reina's face, Glen Johnson's face, Jamie Carragher's face\u2026 everyone is like 'what's happened here?!'\"\n\nReds goalkeeper Reina still remembers the goal as his tweet last year showed , while Callum Campbell, the 16-year-old Liverpool supporter who threw the ball, received threats from fellow supporters went it happened.\n\nWhile if Steve Bruce, the Sunderland boss at the time, was trying to sound magnanimous about a goal that really shouldn't have stood then he certainly failed.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I thought it was a deflection off a player,\" he said after the game.\n\n\"I have to say when I have just seen it there, if anybody knew that rule - that it is supposed to be a dropped ball - then you are a saddo.\n\n\"They have got it on telly with the guy who threw it on and it's got Liverpool crests all over it. What a shame.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWe'll leave the last word to Bent, who is well aware that he'll always be associated with the beach ball - which is now in National Football Museum in Manchester.\n\n\"It was a freak accident but it was a nice goal to score,\" he said..\n\n\"I finished with 106 Premier League goals - although some people say 105! But it's a weird bit of history that I'm proud to be a part of.\"", "description": "Darren Bent famously found the net - with a bit of help - on this day back in 2009", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20640946.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premiership-Sunderland-v-Liverpool-Stadium-of-Light-171009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
