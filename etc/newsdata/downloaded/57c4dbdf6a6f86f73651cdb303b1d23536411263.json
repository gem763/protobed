In a pinch, serve with any chutney you love that\u2019s already on hand, or one that can be purchased last-minute from a local restaurant or store.\n\nDosas | \u0d26\u0d4b\u0d36\n\nBy Joe Thottungal\n\nThe closest we have to a French crepe, the dosa is made of fermented rice and lentils and is typically served for breakfast or as an evening snack. I think of my grandfather whenever I make dosas \u2014 they were a favourite of his, and my mother would always have the batter ready for his arrival. They are typically stuffed with Potato Masala, and are delicious served with Coconut Chutney, Malabar Pepper Lamb, or Cook\u2019s Curry.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 cup patna rice, washed\n\n1 cup ponni rice, washed\n\n\u00bd cup split and hulled black gram (urad dal), rinsed\n\n2 tbsp chana dal or yellow split peas, rinsed\n\n1 tsp fenugreek seeds\n\n1 tsp salt\n\nGhee, for sprinkling\n\n1 \u00bd quantity Potato Masala (see recipe below)\n\nPotato Masala:\n\n2 lbs yellow potatoes, such as Yukon Gold (about 6\u20138), peeled and coarsely chopped\n\n1 \u00bd tsp ground turmeric\n\n3 tsp salt, plus extra to taste (divided)\n\n\u00bc cup coconut oil\n\n\u00bd tsp black mustard seeds\n\n1 \u00bd tsp split and hulled black gram (urad dal)\n\n2 dried red chiles, snapped in half\n\n15 curry leaves, plus extra for garnish\n\n2 tbsp finely chopped ginger\n\n3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n\n2 onions, thinly sliced\n\n2-4 Indian or Thai green chiles, halved lengthwise\n\n\u00bc cup finely sliced carrots\n\n1 cup milk\n\n1 tbsp Ghee\n\nCoarsely chopped cilantro, for garnish\n\nTo serve:\n\nCoconut Chutney (see recipe below)\n\nTomato Chutney (see recipe below)\n\nSambar (optional)\n\nCoconut Chutney:\n\n1 cup fresh or frozen grated coconut\n\n1 (\u00bd-inch) piece ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped\n\n2 Indian or Thai green chiles\n\n\u00bc onion, coarsely chopped\n\n10 curry leaves (divided)\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1 tbsp coconut oil\n\n2 tsp black mustard seeds\n\n2 dried red chiles, snapped in half\n\n1 tsp split and hulled black gram (urad dal)\n\nTomato Chutney:\n\n1 tbsp coconut oil\n\n\u00bd tsp black mustard seeds\n\n1 dried red chile, snapped in half\n\n8 curry leaves\n\n1 onion, coarsely chopped\n\nPinch of salt, plus extra to taste\n\n\u00bd tsp red chili powder\n\n1 cup (2 small) ripe tomatoes, pur\u00e9ed\n\nPreparation\n\nIn a bowl, combine rices, black gram, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds. Cover with cold water and soak for 2-4 hours to soften. Drain, then put mixture into a food processor. Add salt and process to a coarse paste. Pour into a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside at room temperature to ferment overnight, or for at least 6 hours.\n\nHeat a small nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Pour about \u00bc cup batter into the pan. Using the back of a ladle, spread into a thin crepe. Cook for 1 minute, then sprinkle a few drops of ghee on top and flip. Cook for 1 more minute. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining batter.\n\nFill each dosa with \u00bd cup of potato masala and roll up. Serve immediately with chutneys and sambar (if using).\n\nPotato Masala:\n\nPut potatoes, turmeric, and 2 tsp salt in a large saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover the potatoes by an inch. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Drain, then mash. Set aside.\n\nHave a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add black gram, red chiles, and curry leaves and cook for another few seconds until black gram begins to turn brown. Add ginger and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, until lightly brown and fragrant. Transfer to a large heavy-bottomed skillet.\n\nAdd onions, green chiles, and remaining 1 tsp salt and saut\u00e9 over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, until onions have softened. Add carrots and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Add mashed potato and mix well. Pour in milk and add ghee, then adjust salt to taste.\n\nGarnish with curry leaves and cilantro (if using).\n\nCoconut Chutney:\n\nIn a bowl, combine coconut, ginger, green chiles, onion, 5 curry leaves, and salt. Transfer mixture to a food processor, add \u00bd cup warm water, and process until smooth. Transfer mixture to a bowl and set aside.\n\nHave a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add red chiles, black gram, and remaining 5 curry leaves and saut\u00e9 for 20 seconds, until the black gram starts to brown.\n\nAdd spice mixture to the bowl and mix well. Store chutney in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.\n\nMakes 1 \u00bd cups.\n\nTomato Chutney:\n\nHave a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add chile pieces and curry leaves and cook for another 30 seconds until the leaves curl. Transfer the spices to a heavy-bottomed frying pan.\n\nWorking quickly, add onions and a pinch of salt and saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds. Add chili powder and saut\u00e9 for another 30 seconds. Stir in tomato pur\u00e9e and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust salt if needed.\n\nMakes about 4 servings.\n\nYield: Makes 10-12 Dosas\n\nExcerpted from Coconut Lagoon (C) 2019 by Joe Thottungal. Photography (C) 2019 by Christian Lalonde.
