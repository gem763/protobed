Over three million people are currently on the list \u2013 many not convicted of any crime, some not even aware they are suspected of one.\n\nGetting on the list is easy \u2013 employees scour publicly available sources, from court records to search engine results, and apparently make little effort to verify what they find. An investigation by Al Jazeera found hundreds of thousands of Muslim names, some seemingly absurd. In one example, retired Egyptian football player Mohamed Aboutrika was designated a \u201cterrorist\u201d after the Egyptian government added him to its domestic terrorism list for supporting the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, after he was overthrown.\n\nBeyond the overpopulated terrorist databases, the Qatari outlet found that World-Check scours the scandal-sheets and tabloid newspapers of Israel and other countries for names, though its own website claims \u201cresearch is sourced from reputable public domain sources.\u201d Indeed, World-Check boasts that its database includes not only convictions but \u201cperson accused, investigated, arrested, charged, indicted, detained, questioned, or on trial\u201d for a laundry list of crimes including everything from bribery and corruption to slave labor, \u201ccheating,\u201d or \u201cenvironmental crimes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso on rt.com Global \u2018terror\u2019 database leak reveals 2.2mn people tracked by spy agencies\n\nA handful of Muslim organizations, including Finsbury Park Mosque and the Palestinian Return Center in London, have sued World-Check for including them on its terrorism list, which in the mosque\u2019s case resulted in the freezing of its bank accounts. Both reached settlements and had their names withdrawn, and a spokesperson for World-Check told Al Jazeera that any entity believing itself to be wrongly included had the right to request their file and inquire about their status. However, most \u2018non-terrorists\u2019 don\u2019t suspect themselves of being on such a list until something goes wrong \u2013 and when they\u2019re stopped at an airport for extra questioning, they\u2019re unlikely to think to blame a private-sector, open-source reputation-protection scheme.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Total victory\u2019? US terrorist watchlist ruled \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 with no remedy in sight\n\nA legal strike against such ominous coordination of public and private sector surveillance was reversed on Monday, when a US appeals court overturned a September verdict declaring the FBI\u2019s terrorist screening database unconstitutional. Calling the criteria for inclusion on the 1.2-million-strong list \u201creasonably clear,\u201d the Ninth Circuit Court panel of federal judges dismissed concerns about arbitrary enforcement. Under current policy, any American intelligence agency can suggest a person be added to the list, without providing intelligence to back up their nomination or explaining their reasoning. The list is shared with hundreds of private sector entities, most likely including World-Check.\n\nAlso on rt.com Thomson Reuters launches tool to track Russian sanctions\n\nLike this story?
