Walmart did not comment on sales of other calibre ammunition.\n\nWhile short-barrel ammunition is commonly used in some hunting rifles for small animals such as prairie dogs, they can also be used in military-style weapons with high-capacity magazines.\n\nThe NRA said Walmart\u2019s actions would not make the country any safer.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful to see Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites. Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, applauded Walmart\u2019s actions, saying \u201cWalmart has its finger on the pulse of what Americans want.\u201d\n\nWalmart also said it would discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it still sells these guns, and asked customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores, even in states that allowed so-called \u201copen carry\u201d of guns.\n\n\u201cThis decision reflects a clear reality \u2013 Americans want to be kept safe from gun violence,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of an advocacy group founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nJust last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.\n\nOn Friday, Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in a letter to Walmart\u2019s associates, \u201cAs a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.\u201d\n\nMcMillon said he would send letters to the White House and the Congressional leadership, urging the government to strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who could pose an imminent danger.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Walmart is shown on one of its stores in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016.

Given our decades of experience selling firearms, we are also offering to serve as a resource in the national debate on responsible gun sales,\u201d he said in the letter.\n\nThe company added that its latest actions would reduce its market share of ammunition from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.\n\nU.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.", "description": "Walmart Inc said on Tuesday it would discontinue sales of ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in stores across the United States, in response to recent mass shootings in Texas and Ohio.", "authors": ["Nivedita Balu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425835053&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821MI"}
