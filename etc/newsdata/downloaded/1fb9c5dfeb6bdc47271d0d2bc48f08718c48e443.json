Well, its biggest \u201cshocker\u201d is noting the existence of yet another alleged Kavanaugh incident \u2014 but the article leaves out the fact that the supposed victim doesn\u2019t remember a thing.\n\nFor that matter, the guy who apparently made the accusation won\u2019t talk about it: Their account of his memories is based on what other people say he said. Nor has anyone else corroborated the story \u2014 though the authors reached out on the Yale alum Facebook page and doggedly tried to track down anyone who might know anything.\n\nThe Times piece, and the book, also make a big deal about 25 possible witnesses to the incident sorta-kinda recalled by Deborah Ramirez, which The New Yorker and the Times reported during the confirmation fight.\n\nThe FBI, the authors charge, never interviewed any of the 25 \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear how they know that. In any case, several other witnesses have said they were at the party in question, and don\u2019t recall what Ramirez does.\n\nAgain, no one has ever stood up to corroborate what Ramirez decided, after six days consulting with a lawyer, what she recalled about the decades-old incident. (Same for Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s story, too, though the Times pair oh-so-helpfully say, \u201cwe found Dr. Ford\u2019s allegations credible.\u201d)\n\nWhatever the FBI did or didn\u2019t do, the authors (and other reporters working the same beat) did interview everyone who\u2019d talk to them \u2014 and they haven\u2019t found a scintilla of evidence to back up any of the tales.\n\nYet they still hype their smoke and vapors. Why?\n\nPogrebin and Kelly doubtless want to plug their book, and the Times is loyally trying to help.\n\nBut the larger motive here is plainly just to further blacken Kavanaugh\u2019s name in service of a political agenda.\n\nIt\u2019s shameless and disgusting.", "description": "Its biggest \u201cshocker\u201d is noting the existence of yet another alleged Brett Kavanaugh incident \u2014 but the article leaves out the fact that the supposed victim doesn\u2019t remember a thing.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brett-kavanaugh-2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
