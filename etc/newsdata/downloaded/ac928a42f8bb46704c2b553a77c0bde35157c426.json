Ted Cruz sounds ready to run for president again \u2013 in 2024.\n\nSpeaking to The Monitor after a breakfast session with reporters, the Texas Republican didn\u2019t hesitate when asked if he would take another crack at the White House.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope to run again,\u201d said Senator Cruz, who was the runner-up last time to Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. \u201cWe came very, very close in 2016. And it\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d\n\nIf President Trump wins reelection next year, he won\u2019t be eligible to run again; and if a Democrat wins, Republicans will start lining up right away. Mr. Cruz may be first out of the gate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Csmonitor.Com Usa Politics Monitor_Breakfast Ted-Cruz-Eyes-The-White-House-I-Hope-To-Run-Again"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
