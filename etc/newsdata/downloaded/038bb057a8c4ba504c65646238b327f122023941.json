Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the committee\u2019s ranking member, continued. \u201cThese constraints on committee and Republican participation are unacceptable and at odds with House Rules and general fairness. We demand equal representation and participation in this inquiry, there is too much at stake for America and Congress.\u201d\n\nIn the letter addressed to Chairman Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., McCaul further argued that despite statements made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Democrats, \u201cthere is not a \u201cHouse of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d because the entire House has not voted on the matter.\n\nCiting House Rules X and XI, McCaul said that until Congress members from both parties vote to create a special impeachment task force to carry out proceedings, \u201cIntelligence Chairman Adam Schiff lacks the jurisdiction to investigate the Department of State\u2019s conduct of United States foreign policy toward Ukraine. That prerogative belongs to our Members.\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficial impeachment inquiries are initiated by the adoption of a House resolution empowering or creating a committee or task force to undertake such activities,\u201d McCaul continued. \u201cIn both the Nixon and Clinton cases, the Judiciary Committee debated and reported a resolution authorizing the Judiciary Committee to investigate whether there were sufficient grounds to impeach the President, which was then debated and voted on by the full House of Representatives. There have been no such debates or votes in this Congress.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Volker is expected to voluntarily give a deposition before the Schiff-led Intelligence Committee as part of its impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his authority by asking Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nVolker resigned last week after his name surfaced in a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought to pressure Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm that paid the former vice president\u2019s son to serve on its board.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nActing as the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Volker met with Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of directors of Burisma Group, in New York last year even as Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was pressing Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the company and the Bidens\u2019 involvement with it.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "House Republicans\u00a0are demanding an \u201cequal playing field\u201d in the Democrat-led impeachment probe against President Trump after Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said ahead of Thursday\u2019s scheduled testimony from former U.S. envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker that GOP members of the Foreign Affairs Committee will not be permitted to ask questions or have equal representation during the hearing.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Pelosi-Schiff.jpg"}
