But for Malaysian mum Aime Soon who was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer when she was just five months pregnant four years ago, it was all that and so much more.\n\nIn her viral Facebook post on KL\u5439\u6c34\u7ad9, the 40-year-old shares her brave struggle with breast cancer and how it affected her physical and emotional well-being. She recalls her shock when she found out the seriousness of her condition, \u201cI was told by the doctor that it was breast cancer and it was spread in the third phase. Where can I take the courage to accept this?\u201d\n\nIn order to prevent the cancer from spreading any further, her doctors immediately urged her to undergo surgery and chemotherapy to remove the cancerous cells. As time went by, Aime was devastated to see her bald and thin body, something she had never imagined she would look like especially as a pregnant woman. The mum also vividly remembers receiving strange looks from people and wondering if they pitied her, or admired her for her strength.\n\nmum breast cancer More\n\nSource: Aime Soon/Facebook\n\nFinally, after two chemotherapy sessions, Aime\u2019s doctor induced labour and she gave birth to her daughter at 36 weeks.\n\nHowever, instead of celebrating the birth of her little one, Aime had to undergo yet another round of chemotherapy immediately after childbirth. She did not even get to do complete her confinement period.\n\nBut Aime braved through the ordeal and now after four years of staying cancer-free, she and her daughter are happy and healthy. Aime hopes her story gives others the courage to face setbacks even when life brings you down.\n\nmum breast cancer More\n\nSource: Aime Soon/Facebook\n\nBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in Singapore today, with about 1,850 women diagnosed every year, and over 400 dying from the disease each year. But there are also countless brave mums who have survived cancer and are leading healthy lives.\n\nSo mums, to reduce the chances of breast cancer, do get a mammogram done at your nearest medical centre today.\n\nThank you, Aime, for sharing your story.\n\nThe post Mum Defies Breast Cancer To Give Birth To Healthy Baby Girl appeared first on theAsianparent - Your Guide to Pregnancy, Baby & Raising Kids.", "description": "Malaysian mum Aime Soon was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer just five months into her pregnancy.The post Mum Defies Breast Cancer To Give Birth To Healthy Baby Girl appeared first on theAsianparent - Your Guide to Pregnancy, Baby & Raising Kids.", "authors": ["Shreya Jagdish"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H4aDi7xvYebqxFTCBs0.bQ--~B/aD0zOTY7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-EN/theasianparent_sg_5/73f7d666c4b54502ff7f2c7897c570e4", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
