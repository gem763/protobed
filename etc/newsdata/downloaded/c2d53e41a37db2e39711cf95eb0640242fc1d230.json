Strong jobs data on Friday softened the blow.\n\n\u201cInvestors are somewhat tired of the same song and dance from the administration. They are not going to fully buy in until something materializes from the meeting,\u201d said Matt Ruffalo, senior strategist at Clarfeld Financial Advisors in New Jersey.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Oil prices jumped as supply issues took center stage following a week of sharp losses, while stocks and dollar drifted higher with eyes on upcoming Sino-U.S. trade talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crude-oil-prices.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
