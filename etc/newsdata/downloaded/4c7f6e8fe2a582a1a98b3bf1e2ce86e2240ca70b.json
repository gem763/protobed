Something\u2019s up.\u201d\n\nFrom the moment that it\u2019s announced that rugby coach Eddie Jones will be up for media duties two days ahead of schedule \u2013 and bringing captain Owen Farrell with him \u2013 speculation is rife about what has caused the sudden change of heart.\n\nNormally, Jones and Farrell will only speak to the media on team announcement and match days, though last weekend the England boss helpfully waited until Sunday to speak publicly so that the identity of their quarter-final opponents could be discovered.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut a Tuesday appearance? That very rarely happens, meaning there must be some big announcement. Plans are put in place, other press conferences are ditched and the British media swarm en masse on Disneyland Tokyo, where England are based for their semi-final week at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nOn the way there, every eventuality is played out: is Farrell injured and going home? Are they naming the team early? Are they trying to hide injuries? Is Jones angry about something \u2013 again? Have the England squad gone all 2011 on us and landed themselves in trouble? Is Jones about to quit?\n\nOne of the more sensible options centres around England trying to set the agenda and get ahead of the All Blacks by chucking out a few grenades to disrupt the status quo \u2013 after all, that\u2019s what England are trying to do this weekend in knocking off the back-to-back world champions.\n\nAnd so it quickly transpires; a spying allegation here, a swipe at the Kiwi media there. Jones\u2019 press conference had everything that it should feature when it is choreographed with the precision of a World Cup opening ceremony. Jones smiled and laughed his way through it, joking around while making serious and newsworthy allegations in the process, all the while knowing that his words would ruffle plenty of feathers.\n\nIt was textbook Eddie Jones, and the truth is that the biggest surprise comes in this tactic taking so long to appear in Japan. But with the dominant All Blacks in England\u2019s crosshairs, Jones went back to his trusty verbal weapon. Now this feels like a World Cup semi-final fitting of its high billing.\n\nYours,\n\nJack de Menezes\n\nDeputy sports editor", "description": "The text message arrives. \u201cEddie, Mitchell and Farrell top table.\u201d A quick glance at the date confirms it is only Tuesday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right, surely?
