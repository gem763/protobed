Calling for the end of the modern industrial economy, advocating to put millions of people out of work\u2026 is not a real world solution.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that protesters were led by \u201cindigenous drummers\u201d and held signs with slogans, including \u201cBe a Better Ancestor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow this crisis to continue to be a partisan, political question,\u201d Thunberg said at the protest. \u201cThe climate and ecological crisis is far beyond party politics and the main enemy right now should not be any political opponents, because our main enemy is physics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are doing this because our future is at stake,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cWe will not be bystanders. We are doing this because we want the people in power to unite behind science.\u201d\n\nWhile Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future movement calls for kids to cut classes every Friday to protest, the teen is taking months off from school to support demonstrations in the United States and Canada. She also plans to travel to Chile in December for another United Nations climate summit.\n\nThunberg came to the United States in August traveling from Europe to New York City on a state-of-the-art racing yacht that is solar- and wind-powered.\n\nBut her carbon-free trip has been criticized because the yacht\u2019s crew flew by plane back and forth as part of the logistics for the journey, making a much greater \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d than one girl traveling by plane would make.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Thunberg traveled to Canada in Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s electric vehicle for the trip north from the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Thunberg will travel to South America.\n\n\u201cAlberta is home to Canada\u2019s vast oil sands and holds the world\u2019s third-largest crude reserves, but has struggled to recover from the 2014-15 global oil price crash because of delays building new export pipelines as a result of environmental opposition and regulatory hold-ups,\u201d the Daily Mail reported. \u201cMany energy sector workers and the Alberta government feel the oil sands, scorned by environmentalists for their high carbon emissions intensity, have been unfairly targeted and say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "At a climate change protest in Canada on Friday oil and gas industry workers challenged the teen for threatening their jobs.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Greta-Thunberg-2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
