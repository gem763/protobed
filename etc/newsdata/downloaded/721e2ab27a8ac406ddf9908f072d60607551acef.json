DIS, +0.53% , Apple Inc. AAPL, +2.66% , AT&T Inc.\u2019s T, +0.43% HBO Max, Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, +2.36% NBCUniversal, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.68% , and Roku Inc. ROKU, +4.71% .\n\nThe first hint of what this means for Netflix and its investors could come Oct. 16, when Netflix reports its third-quarter earnings.\n\nThe first great success story of the genre has lately been a cautionary tale about the fickle nature of consumers\u2019 viewing habits and the cyclical nature of hit shows. Netflix shares have dived 24% since July 17, when it disclosed disappointing figures about the number of people signing up for the service. Netflix added 2.8 million net new international subscribers but lost 126,000 U.S. customers in the quarter that ended in June. Wall Street, conversely, expected 352,000 additional domestic customers and 4.8 million new viewers overseas.\n\nRead more: Netflix stock drops more than 10% as earnings show huge decline in new subscribers\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been competing with many people in the last decade, it\u2019s a whole new world starting in November,\u201d Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said at the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, England, last month, according to Variety. \u201cIt\u2019ll be tough competition.\u201d\n\nNetflix faces \u201cunprecedented competition\u201d that could \u201clead to adverse impacts on content spend and pricing power, impacting [free cash flow] generation and revenue growth, respectively,\u201d Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan said in a note Oct. 9. He lowered his price target on the stock to $265 from $330 though he maintains a Neutral rating.\n\nBut with a huge lead in subscribers and a packed programming schedule, Netflix is in no immediate danger. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company is depending in great part on a popular TV franchise and the presumptive Best Picture Oscar front-runner. \u201cEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\u201d debuts this month, and \u201cThe Irishman\u201d is due on Netflix Nov. 27 after a small, limited run in theaters.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix has locked up content agreements with the Duffer Brothers, creators of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d for nine figures; \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss for a reported $200 million to $300 million; and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes for more than $100 million.\n\nTopping it off, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth at least $500 million to offer all the episodes of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d starting in 2021.\n\nIt\u2019s enough for LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield to initiate coverage of Netflix this month with a whopping price target of $375. He believes \u201ccompetition will accelerate Internet TV revolution.\u201d\n\nNetflix has forecast up to 750,000 paid subscriber additions in the third quarter, with results scheduled to be released on Oct. 16. Netflix is the market leader, with some 60 million domestic and 91.5 million international subscribers.\n\nFor the immediate future, Netflix\u2019s dominance appears safe. By 2021, however, things could get dicey, says Needham analyst Laura Martin. She expects a price war worldwide then that will force Netflix to lower subscription fees of $9 to $16 a month. The company risks losing 5 million to 10 million of its 60 million U.S. subscribers in 2020 if it doesn\u2019t act soon, she warned in an Oct. 3 note.\n\nNetflix shares have gained 2.3% year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.34% has climbed 20% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.09% has rallied 18%.", "description": "The competitive landscape has weighed heavily on the minds of Netflix Inc. investors.", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS794_Netfli_ZG_20191007121401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
