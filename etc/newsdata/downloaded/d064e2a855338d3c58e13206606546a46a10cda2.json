All they have to do is spend three seconds on Google, spend three seconds talking to somebody that is not completely brainwashed to see that this is a horrible deal for the Kurds. The Kurds are going to be wiped out and Donald Trump said it was a great deal for Turkey because now Turkey doesn\u2019t have to kill millions of people.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAgain, it is so absolutely flummoxing what the president said this week. And the responsibility, you know, sure, it\u2019s with the president, but at this point, it\u2019s with the people cheering and waving things, Trump flags in the audience. They have a responsibility to not be dumb. And they have a responsibility to be informed. They have a responsibility not to be ignorant. And all I\u2019m asking is that they just spend two or three minutes actually looking at the news and educating themselves.\u201c\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "Friday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" host Joe Scarborough reacted to President Donald Trump's rally from the night before in Dallas, TX.
