I was offended and angered by the incident on Saturday night. I had strong words to the man involved, he apologised and I accepted that apology. That should be the end of it as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\n\n\nNewman said he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he realised he had offended Sales.\n\n\u201cI apologised on the night profusely and she accepted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an attempt at humour and light entertainment to start the night off.\n\n\u201cI am upset my judgment wasn\u2019t better. I am embarrassed I brought any disrespect on the foundation and on Leigh.\u201d\n\nThe chair of the Trish Foundation, Carol Langsford, also apologised to Sales.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly honoured that Leigh gives her valuable time and great professional skills to the Trish MS Research Foundation year after year,\u201d Langsford told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cWe are terribly upset that Leigh was embarrassed by one of our volunteers and of course, our volunteer and the Trish Foundation apologise sincerely and unreservedly.\u201d\n\nSales has hosted the event for the past four years.", "description": "ABC presenter says it would be \u2018gutless\u2019 not to stand up over \u2018intolerable behaviour\u2019 from retired businessman", "authors": ["Amanda Meade"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115a594e6cf54f8e89463893847d2b9331be306d/0_0_5054_3034/master/5054.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26386d90d484a2013b14f63e8f044871"}
