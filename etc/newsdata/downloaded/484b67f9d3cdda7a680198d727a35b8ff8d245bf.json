I have to say a huge thanks to my team \u2013 the guys continue to work incredibly hard and stay focused.\n\n\u201cThey came here on the back foot and we pulled through \u2014 we had a quite a bit of damage and the race was a struggle, but I kept my head down and it felt like a long second stint.\u201d\n\nHe said his victory \u201cwas for Bono\u201d, his regular race engineer Peter Bonnington who missed the race as he recovered at home in Britain after a minor surgery.\n\nBonnington\u2019s replacement Marcus Dudley and the team\u2019s strategist James Vowles did more than \u201cstep up to the plate\u201d, as Hamilton said, they delivered a perfect strategic platform for his victory.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do it for Bono because he is here with us in spirit and Marcus did a great job.\n\n\u201cFor us all, it is quite emotional. Bono knows how we feel. After all these years, he knows. I could not have done it without him or them, the team and I hope they are all as proud of me as I am of them.\u201d\n\nHamilton said he did not mind not winning the title in Mexico as he had without a podium finish in 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind, I love racing and I take it one race at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a race I\u2019ve wanted to win for some time and it\u2019s been a bit tricky for us.\n\n\u201cToday I had the opportunity and the car held together and the team executing the best strategy.\u201d\n\nHamilton thrilled a massive crowd of more than 120,000 inside the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez with a demonstration of \u2018doughnut spins\u2019 before he \u2013 and his car \u2013 celebrated on the podium.\n\nMercedes team chief Toto Wolff praised Hamilton for conjuring a victory out of the jaws of defeat with a disciplined drive.\n\n\u201cWho would have expected that result for us after we started P3 and P6 he said \u2013 to come out of it one and three?\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s the right balance, with Lewis, between the aggression that you need to have on the out-lap, to undercut, but also then to switch and manage the tyres to the end of the race.\n\n\u201cAnd the communication with the engineer is very important because you are almost flying blind.\u201d\n\nHe said Mercedes did not know that the tyres would last.\n\n\u201cWe thought he could make it, but for him in the car it feels bizarre to make 47 laps on one tyre.\u201d", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Lewis Hamilton shrugged off any disappointment he felt at not clinching a sixth world title on Sunday by heaping praise on his", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/1377a5_hope-are-all-as-proud-me-as-am-hamilton-his-mercedes-team-hamilton-proud-mercedes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
