Mr Beddow said these businesses would grow as the Australian population increased at 1.5 per cent each year, which is the fastest rate in the West.\n\nRecent additions to Argo's portfolio also include Freedom foods, a food and beverage company that distributes dairy and cereal across Australia and South-East Asia, and building developer Downer EDI, which will try to seize on high government spending on infrastructure.\n\nArgo has also increased its stake in Ramsay Health Care, flagging that companies such as CSL and Sonic Healthcare were \"exceptionally high-quality\" and that it would look to purchase more in the sector at an attractive price.\n\nThe biggest share of Argo's portfolio, at 17 per cent, was tied up with the large retail banks, which face headwinds from low interest rates, slowing credit growth, and increased competition from challenger banks.\n\nMr Beddow said he acknowledged these risks and that Argo was \"cautious\" in its outlook, but also said the company was comfortable with its underweight position given \"relatively attractive\" yields.\n\nMeanwhile, the investment group also saw a \"solid\" outlook for mining giants BHP Group and Rio Tinto, which account for $520 million, or 9 per cent of its portfolio.\n\nMr Beddow said Chinese demand for steel to support real estate and infrastructure investment remained robust, but acknowledged that this period of excess dividend returns and capital management would slow with a moderating iron ore price.\n\nArgo reported in August profit of $292.7 million for 2018-19, an increase of 33.7 per cent from the previous year, including $36 million one-off, non-cash income from the demerger of Coles Group from Wesfarmers.\n\nShares in Argo Investments remained steady at $8.36 on Monday.", "description": "Argo managing director Jason Beddow said the ASX was ignoring low earnings growth and a challenging geopolitical outlook.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2a64b2558185130f56ef9bd0050baf732d713591", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
