The challenge for us is how do we motivate the players', added Neville, having chopped back his squad from 25 to 20 to stamp out any complacency and heighten the sense of competition.\n\nDespite England being without a win since losing the third place World Cup tie against Sweden in July, some 32,000 tickets have been sold for the Lionesses samba date at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium. But Neville insists they must regain winning form if they are to chase regular international outings in Premier League grounds around the country.\n\n'We need to keep producing great performances so that when we're selecting stadiums for the next four, five friendlies, we're looking at Wembley all the time, Old Trafford, Anfield and all the biggest stadiums in the country, that's the aim.'", "description": "CLAIRE BLOOMFIELD IN DURHAM: The Lionesses must wait until the European Championships on home soil in July 2021 for their next competitive fixture.", "authors": ["Claire Bloomfield For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/23/19318204-0-image-a-28_1570228926564.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
