(Adrian Wyld/THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nThe cost-cutting measures came one day after Hexo postponed the release of its fourth-quarter results to Oct. 28 and its conference call to Oct. 29 as it announced a $70-million private placement of convertible debentures led by a group of investors, including St-Louis and board directors.\n\nThe company said it intends to use the proceeds of the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nAnalysts said Wednesday the involvement of senior management and directors in the financing is positive and said it would provide confidence to investors, but given that the conversion price of $3.16 was below the previous day's close it also signals that Hexo has little conviction in its near-term outlook.\n\nEarlier this month, Hexo said its fourth quarter net revenue was expected to be about $14.5 million to $16.5 million, down from the roughly $26 million it had forecast previously. Hexo also said it was withdrawing its previously issued outlook for its 2020 financial year of up to $400 million in net revenue.\n\nThe executive departures announced Thursday are the latest changes in the upper ranks of the cannabis company.\n\nAlso in early October, Hexo said its chief financial officer Michael Monahan resigned, effective immediately, after taking on the role in May, citing family reasons.", "description": "Cannabis company Hexo Corp is reducing its workforce by 200 jobs to adjust for expected future revenues and \"ensure the long-term viability\" of the firm, its chief executive said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5333994.1571942539!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hexo-cuts-20191024.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
