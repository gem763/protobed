The once-a-day pill may become obsolete after almost 60 years", "language": "en", "text": "Why, almost six decades since the Pill became available on the NHS in 1961, do so many women still struggle to find contraception that suits them? With more than three million prescriptions for it annually in the UK, the Pill is still the most-prescribed form of birth control. Yet there are growing concerns that GPs are too reliant on it, with women missing out on newer, more effective alternatives.\n\nEarlier this year a new website, The Lowdown (theldown.com) \u2014 described as \u2018TripAdvisor for contraception\u2019 \u2014 went viral shortly after its launch, allowing women to rate different methods. As its founder Alice Pelton, has said: \u2018[Women] may feel stuck and frustrated . . . there aren\u2019t any five-out-of-five options.\u2019\n\nIndeed, more than half of UK women (59 per cent) are unhappy with their contraception, according to a recent survey by Superdrug. And two in three say they have remained on their current pill for five years or more despite side-effects such as nausea, irregular bleeding, changes in weight and mental health problems, according to online doctor Zava UK.\n\nHere, Good Health asks experts whether the Pill is past its sell-by date; if there are safer, more effective alternatives; and why take-up of newer options is so slow.\n\nHere, Good Health asks experts whether the Pill is past its sell-by date; if there are safer, more effective alternatives; and why take-up of newer options is so slow (stock image)\n\nTHE PILL IS SO 'LAST CENTURY'\n\nAlmost nine out of ten women who get contraception from their GP take the Pill.\n\nThere are two main types: the combined Pill, which contains synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone to prevent ovulation; and the \u2018mini pill\u2019, which has progesterone only and works principally by thickening cervical mucus so sperm can\u2019t reach the womb.\n\nYet the Pill is \u2018last century\u2019s method\u2019 says John Guillebaud, an emeritus professor of family planning and reproductive health at University College London, who adds: \u2018It is not the best method of contraception by a long, long way.\u2019\n\nAlmost nine out of ten women who get contraception from their GP take the Pill\n\nHe says methods known as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are more effective and less subject to user error, as they don\u2019t need to be taken every day.\n\nThese include progesterone injections (given every 12 weeks) and implants \u2014 such as the contraceptive implant (a capsule in the upper arm which releases progesterone), intrauterine devices (IUDs) implanted in the womb such as the Mirena coil (which releases progesterone) and the hormone-free copper coil (copper stops sperm surviving in the womb).\n\nWhile it\u2019s often stated that the Pill is 99 per cent effective, this only applies to \u2018perfect use\u2019.\n\nIn reality, it\u2019s only 91 per cent effective, as women may forget to take it occasionally, not take it at consistent times of the day, or may absorb it poorly due to diarrhoea or vomiting \u2014 meaning an estimated nine in 100 women on it will become pregnant in a year.\n\nBy comparison, one in 100 women a year will become pregnant while using a LARC.\n\n\u2018LARCs are the best contraceptives, and of these, intra-uterine devices are the best of the best,\u2019 says Professor Guillebaud, who is the author of the book Contraception Today. \u2018They\u2019re as effective against pregnancy as female sterilisation, only they\u2019re reversible.\u2019\n\nThere are, however, downsides. Fitting can be uncomfortable, and they can\u2019t be as quickly reversed as the Pill \u2014 they\u2019re designed to stay in for several years, though can be taken out by a doctor sooner.\n\nFor women who have completed their families, sterilisation might be an option. Almost one in five women aged between 35 and 49 have been sterilised, according to to a 2018 study published in BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health.\n\nBut in 2017, Essure \u2014 a device inserted into the fallopian tubes and marketed as a quicker, \u2018gentler\u2019 alternative to sterilisation surgery \u2014 was withdrawn from the market following reports that in some women it had led to chronic pelvic pain, bleeding and allergic reactions. Some women required surgery to remove the device where it had migrated and damaged surrounding tissue.\n\nCurrently, therefore, the only option for women wishing to be sterilised involves surgery to block or \u2014 more rarely \u2014 to remove the fallopian tubes, and there can be a long wait on the NHS.\n\nWOMEN DENIED OTHER OPTIONS\n\nMeanwhile, some newer contraceptives popular in other countries, such as the contraceptive ring (a flexible plastic ring that goes inside the vagina, where it releases oestrogen and progesterone), aren\u2019t always available.\n\n\u2018The NuvaRing is off the formulary [the list of recommended treatments] in a lot of areas, so you\u2019re not supposed to prescribe it,\u2019 says Dr Shahzadi Harper, a Harley Street GP who specialises in women\u2019s health and also works as a NHS locum.\n\n\u2018But it can be useful for women who get a lot of nausea or gastric symptoms on the Pill, or who have irritable bowel syndrome, as the hormones are localised rather than having a systemic effect.\n\n\u2018Some just prefer it as they don\u2019t get the tiredness or breast tenderness they do with the Pill.\u2019\n\n\u2018Within the NHS, our hands are tied because of cost restrictions,\u2019 she adds. \u2018The Pill is super-cheap [around \u00a31 a month].\u2019\n\nThere are also newer versions of the Pill, containing hormones that are a closer match to women\u2019s natural ones which may reduce side-effects (see below). But they are more expensive, around \u00a35 a month, and less frequently prescribed.\n\nThere are newer versions of the Pill, containing hormones that are a closer match to women\u2019s natural ones which may reduce side-effects (stock image)\n\nCOULD THE COIL BE A BETTER CHOICE?\n\nMost women can use an IUD \u2014 Professor Guillebaud\u2019s \u2018best of the best\u2019 option \u2014 so why do recent figures suggest fewer than 5 per cent who go to their GP for contraception are prescribed one?\n\nUptake of LARCs is lower here than in similar countries, such as France, according to a 2017 report by the London School of Economics. And a 2016 survey of GP surgeries by the Family Planning Association found that less than 2 per cent offer a full range of contraceptive options.\n\n\u2018Many women are not getting a good deal when they go to the GP,\u2019 says Professor Guillebaud, adding that it\u2019s \u2018crazy\u2019 the most effective treatment options still aren\u2019t the most widely prescribed \u2018especially when it\u2019s often not expensive\u2019.\n\nThe copper coil IUD, for instance, costs around \u00a310 and lasts for ten years, he says. \u2018In my working lifetime, we\u2019ve gone up from eight methods of contraception to 15, and just two of these are pills. Yet GPs are being forced into making other options less available.\u2019\n\nIn 2017, the Royal College of General Practitioners published a report describing the \u2018significant obstacles\u2019 family doctors face providing contraception, including finding it harder to access the training needed \u2018to be able to give the most effective forms of contraception . . . In England, payments to GPs for giving patients LARCs often no longer cover the cost of administering them,\u2019 the report warned.\n\nConcerns were also raised that many of the doctors currently trained to provide services such as coil-fitting are due to retire.\n\nIf their GP can\u2019t fit an IUD, women may have to wait for an appointment at a specialist sexual health service \u2014 an additional barrier that may be impractical for some, says Dr Helen Munro, a NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health based in Wales, who is also vice-president of the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019re told you can walk out with a contraceptive method there and then, or wait a couple of months to have a coil fitted, chances are you\u2019re going to walk out with the Pill,\u2019 she says.\n\nFurthermore, NHS sexual health and reproductive services have been cut by local authorities in recent years.\n\n\u2018There is a crisis coming our way,\u2019 says Dr Munro. \u2018Women can\u2019t get the appointments they need and GPs aren\u2019t incentivised any more or are finding it hard to access training to provide certain services. And eight million women no longer have access to specialist services near where they live.\u2019\n\nFEARS ABOUT SIDE-EFFECTS\n\nWhile IUDs are held up as the gold standard by many doctors, others have pointed out this is only because of a lack of innovation in this area.\n\nEarlier this year, a special issue of the U.S. periodical Scientific American highlighted the lack of any real advances in the last decade, with little interest from pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u2018They think that there are enough products for female contraception,\u2019 said R\u00e9gine Sitruk-Ware, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Population Council\u2019s Center for Biomedical Research in New York. And women have their own fears about IUDs, too.\n\nQUIZ TO HELP YOU CHOOSE To help women find the best possible contraception, last year Judith Stephenson, a professor of sexual and reproductive health at University College London, and her team launched an online algorithm. It provides women with the three most effective options suited to their lifestyle and preferences, based on a short quiz. For example, it asks whether you\u2019re happy to take hormones, and whether there\u2019s a chance you\u2019d like to get pregnant in the next few months. Go to: contraceptionchoices.org/whats-right-for-me\n\n\u2018They will often say things like their mum had a bad experience or their friend couldn\u2019t get pregnant after using an implant,\u2019 says Dr Munro.\n\nShe suggests that part of the reason fears are so prevalent is that IUDs are not as widely used, so women are less likely to hear positive accounts from other women \u2014 and negative experiences will be given disproportionate weight.\n\nIt may also be down to the reputation of older devices no longer on the market: in the 1970s some IUDs were linked with pelvic inflammatory disease, injury and infertility.\n\nToday\u2019s devices are much safer, but they may not be side-effect free. For example, a trial involving 11,000 women, published in the journal Drug Safety earlier this year, found that women who used a hormone-releasing coil, such as a Mirena, were 17 per cent more likely to experience depression than those who had a hormone-free copper coil.\n\nA link was also found with anxiety and disturbed sleep.\n\n\u2018Not all women will get on with an IUD,\u2019 concedes Dr Munro. \u2018The most common reason women request to have one removed is discomfort,\u2019 she says.\n\nThere is a newer device \u2014 the intrauterine ball \u2014 which consists of small copper-coated beads on loops (compared to the conventional T-shaped coil). \u2018It\u2019s not rigid, so the idea is it\u2019s more comfortable,\u2019 says Dr Munro.\n\nThe intrauterine ball has theoretically been available in the UK since 2017. However, Dr Munro says there\u2019s not sufficient evidence it stays in place effectively for the NHS to offer it yet.\n\nRETURN OF THE RHYTHM METHOD\n\nA British study published in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health in 2018 found that 38 per cent of sexually active women aged 35-49 who are not trying to conceive use either no contraception or an unreliable method \u2014 such as withdrawal or timing sex to avoid ovulation.\n\nSuch \u2018natural family planning\u2019 or the \u2018rhythm method\u2019 has had a resurgence. The idea is that couples avoid having sex on a woman\u2019s most fertile days of the month \u2014 the ones in the run up to and just after ovulation.\n\nSpearheading the trend is a controversial smartphone app called Natural Cycles, which uses an algorithm that predicts fertile days according to daily temperature readings. The firm says it now has 250,000 UK users.\n\nIt\u2019s been marketed as an alternative to hormonal contraception. But last year the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that a Facebook advert claiming Natural Cycles was a \u2018highly accurate contraceptive app\u2019 was \u2018misleading\u2019 and mustn\u2019t appear again.\n\nThere have also been reports of unwanted pregnancies from women using the app; in Sweden, one hospital reported that 68 women seeking terminations in one six-month period said they had been using Natural Cycles.\n\nMaisie Hill, an alternative women\u2019s health practitioner and author of the book Period Power, who uses natural family planning with her clients and relies on it herself, says: \u2018Some people are driven to this method because of concerns about hormonal-based birth control and not wanting to have an internal device.\n\n\u2018Frankly, they\u2019re choosing it because they can\u2019t find something that suits them better.\n\n\u2018For a lot of women, when it comes to conventional contraception, it can still feel like choosing the best of a bad bunch.\u2019\n\nThere is \u2018a growing fear around hormonal treatment \u2014 and a lot of misinformation\u2019, says Dr Christine Ekechi, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London. \u2018But we all have hormones \u2014 that\u2019s why we have periods \u2014 and taking hormonal contraception is not so different from what\u2019s happening in the body anyway,\u2019 she says.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees.\n\n\u2018The progestogens [synthetic progesterone] in contraceptive pills are very different to our own progesterone,\u2019 says Dr Elaine McQuade, a GP at the Marion\n\nGluck Clinic in London (which specialises in bio-identical hormones, said to be more \u2018natural\u2019). \u2018For some people they work really well; for others they can cause a lot of problems.\u2019\n\nA British study published in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health in 2018 found that 38 per cent of sexually active women aged 35-49 who are not trying to conceive use either no contraception or an unreliable method (stock image)\n\nWHAT TO DO OVER 40\n\nSome contraceptive pills may be better than others. For example, the oestrogen in the Zoely (introduced in the UK in 2013) and Qlaira (available since 2009) pills has a molecular structure which \u2018is identical to 90 per cent of what our bodies produce\u2019, explains GP Dr Harper.\n\nProfessor Guillebaud adds that doctors should consider prescribing one of these \u2018gentler\u2019 forms of oestrogen if someone is not getting on well with another more commonly prescribed Pill as they may find side-effects are improved. Dr Harper says Zoely and Qlaira are also good options for older women approaching the menopause. \u2018They contain the same oestrogen used in most HRT to help with symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats,\u2019 she says.\n\nIn effect, they provide contraception and hormone replacement therapy in one.\n\nBut these newer pills are more expensive, says Professor Guillebaud. \u2018Zoely is around \u00a34 or \u00a35 a month and Qlaira is even more, so they\u2019re not widely prescribed in the NHS.\u2019\n\nThe Mirena coil is another option for women starting to get menopausal symptoms, says Dr Harper.\n\n\u2018I like to suggest it to women in their 40s if they develop peri-menopausal symptoms because then if they decide later on that they want to step up to HRT, we only need to give them oestrogen.\u2019\n\nWHY YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAKE A BREAK EACH MONTH\n\nThe traditional seven-day break recommended between Pill packs, during which time a withdrawal bleed mimicking menstruation occurs, is too long and should be \u2018consigned to history\u2019, according to research published in the journal BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health last year.\n\n\u2018There was never any medical reason,\u2019 says Professor John Guillebaud, one of the study\u2019s authors. \u2018The Pill\u2019s inventor, John Rock, hoped it would seem more natural so the Pope would accept it as a method of contraception; it was also designed to reassure women they weren\u2019t pregnant.\u2019\n\nThe traditional seven-day break recommended between Pill packs, during which time a withdrawal bleed mimicking menstruation occurs, is too long and should be \u2018consigned to history\u2019 (stock image)\n\nThe researchers found that the seven-day break was long enough for the ovaries to start functioning again, increasing the risk of pregnancy.\n\nIn theory, taking the Pill continuously instead also means a lower dose of synthetic oestrogen would be needed to keep the ovaries suppressed \u2014 potentially a third of that currently taken by most women on the Pill. This could lead to fewer side-effects. Blood clots are estimated to affect between five and 12 women in every 10,000 taking the combined pill, compared to two in 10,000 women not taking hormonal contraception. \u2018Oestrogen is the main culprit that\u2019s linked with problems such as clots,\u2019 says Professor Guillebaud.\n\n\u2018You could probably get a Pill that had only 10mcg of oestrogen, rather than 20mcg, the lowest available at the moment in this country,\u2019 he says. (The two most commonly prescribed pills in the UK, Microgynon and Rigevidon, contain 30mcg of synthetic oestrogen.)\n\nAlthough guidelines were updated to reflect the new thinking about the Pill break, the message has been slow to filter through to GPs and pharmacists, says Professor Guillebaud.\n\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE\n\nDenise Van Outen, 45, answers our health quiz\n\nActress and TV presenter Denise Van Outen, 45, answers our health quiz\n\nCAN YOU RUN UP THE STAIRS?\n\nDefinitely. I do a 45-minute crossfit and interval training workout with my personal trainer most days. I also play golf with my partner, Eddie.\n\nGET YOUR FIVE A DAY?\n\nI\u2019ve just had a banana! Generally, I try to eat well, although it can be tricky because of my job.\n\nEVER DIETED?\n\nI\u2019ve never counted calories and don\u2019t cut anything out. I\u2019ve never really been overweight (I\u2019m 5ft 6in and 8st 3lb). I am disciplined, but it helps that I don\u2019t like chocolate or cakes.\n\nANY VICES?\n\nCrisps! I can devour a family packet of salt and vinegar watching the TV.\n\nANY FAMILY AILMENTS?\n\nMy grandmother had a stroke and my dad had a couple of minor strokes. That\u2019s made me look after my health as I get older. For instance, I\u2019ve really cut back on alcohol. I\u2019m not teetotal, but I only have the odd glass of wine on special occasions.\n\nWORST ILLNESS?\n\nI broke my right leg jumping on my mum\u2019s bed when I was eight. I also fractured my heel while training for my West End role in Chicago. It was probably cracked, but I pushed myself too hard and carried on, even though it was painful. I had a cast for 12 weeks \u2014 I learned my lesson!\n\nPOP ANY PILLS?\n\nVitamin D, so as not to be deficient in winter, plus magnesium, which helps maintain muscle function and with regulating blood pressure.\n\nMs Van Outen said: 'I do a 45-minute crossfit and interval training workout with my personal trainer most days'\n\nHAD ANYTHING REMOVED?\n\nMy appendix when I was eight. I don\u2019t remember much about it.\n\nEVER HAVE PLASTIC SURGERY?\n\nNo. I try to maintain myself by being fit and eating well. I have non-surgical treatments, such as LED light therapy (non-invasive, non-thermal light therapy to boost skin collagen).\n\nCOPE WELL WITH PAIN?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve got a high pain threshold, which comes from years of dancing.\n\nTRIED ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS?\n\nAfter I did Strictly Come Dancing, I had regular acupuncture for my aches and pains. It really helped.\n\nEVER BEEN DEPRESSED?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say depressed, but I\u2019ve had anxiety. I had a panic attack about a year ago and my GP wanted to put me on antidepressants. I said no as I wasn\u2019t depressed. Nadia Sawalha on Loose Women suggested I have my hormone levels tested. It turned out the cause was low progesterone. I was given bioidentical hormones, which are made from plants but are chemically the same as those the body makes \u2014 it made a big difference.", "description": "There are more than three million prescriptions for the pill annually in the UK.
