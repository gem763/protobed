In an odd turn of events, one of those world leaders the president is scheduled to meet with Wednesday afternoon is Zelensky.\n\n\"The Democrats, they went down to see the president of Ukraine and they asked him for all sorts of things and 'don't go with the Republicans' and 'stay with us', like it's a political war,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"They shouldn't have done that. That should be an impeachable event.\"\n\nBut Americans can decide for themselves whether Mr Trump exerted pressure over a foreign leader to investigate his political rival.\n\nIn the much-anticipated memorandum of the call, Mr. Trump urges Zelensky to look into unsubstantiated claims that former Vice President Joe Biden allegedly tried to stop prosecution that would affect his son. The president, according to the call memo, urged Ukraine to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr on the matter.\n\nThe memo, however, is not verbatim, but rather, a summary \u2014 causing concern among Trump critics that the administration's records might be incomplete.\n\nTrump reacts to release of Ukraine call memo\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it...\" the president said during the call, which took place a day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified.\n\nMr. Trump reminded Zelensky separately in the transcript that the U.S. does a lot for Ukraine. The Justice Department insists the transcript shows nothing illegal. The transcript release comes less than a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the president.", "description": "President Trump's meetings with foreign leaders continue at the United Nations General Assembly as the House launches a impeachment inquiry", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/24/3e0078fd-87c0-4207-b1e2-5d25cdf655bf/thumbnail/1200x630/36c641825f67a7a954b3d861f821c906/gettyimages-1169841497.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
