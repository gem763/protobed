Rather than creating a new offence, the new law removes the defence of \u201cjustifiable assault\u201d which used to be available to adults accused of assaulting children. Henceforth the law will give equal protection to victims irrespective of age.\n\nIt was a mistake by the SNP not to bring its own bill, and a pity that the party has delayed the incorporation into Scottish law of the UN convention on the rights of the child. But the decision to support the bill introduced by Green MSP (and former policeman) John Finnie was a good one, while its smooth passage is a credit to Scottish parliamentarians. English, Welsh and Northern Irish campaigners must now step up their efforts on behalf of the rest of the UK\u2019s children, and against the \u201creasonable punishment\u201d defence that is the equivalent of justifiable assault in Scotland \u2013 and allows parents or carers to strike children, including babies, providing they do not leave marks on the skin.\n\nThere are not many people nowadays who defend hitting children on principle. Evidence that violent punishments are more harmful than beneficial to young people\u2019s emotional development and mental health has been accumulating for decades. Mostly, adults hit children when they are enraged and out of control (in other words, in a similar frame of mind to that in which they might strike other adults). Such conduct teaches children that attacking others is an acceptable way to deal with angry feelings. It also, especially given the disparities in size and strength between adults and children, carries risks, and is sometimes linked to domestic abuse.\n\nWith the support of children\u2019s charities and all four UK children\u2019s commissioners, the Welsh government, like the Scottish one, is keen to act. Given the weight of international opinion, the commitment to \u201cend violence\u201d enshrined in the UN convention on the rights of the child, and years of work by the Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children, this ought to be uncontroversial. Yet the UK parliament has not voted on the question since 2004 \u2013 when Tony Blair refused to give Labour MPs a free vote on an amendment that would have granted children equal protection.\n\n\u201cNanny state\u201d rhetoric is one reason for this. In a democracy, laws are the rules we choose to live by. But the insinuation that voters are being patronised undermines public understanding of the positive changes they can bring about, by changing attitudes and behaviour. Scotland\u2019s move at least puts the issue back into the spotlight, and gives children\u2019s rights campaigners the best chance they have had for years to make the case that the law allowing adults to assault children is outdated. In future decades we will be ashamed it was not altered sooner.", "description": "Editorial: By granting children equal protection against assault, Holyrood has set an example for the rest of the UK", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec81b85b99d72c1ed4451c7ec89086634ca56a0/0_203_1652_991/master/1652.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dd318b3a548082c4556836b85bf7f856"}
