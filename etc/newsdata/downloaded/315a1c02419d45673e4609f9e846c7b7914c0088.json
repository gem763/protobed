It's a plane! It's a...restaurant?!\n\nHoused in a Boeing KC-97 tanker, The Airplane Restaurant serves more than peanuts and pretzels \u2014 Photo courtesy of The Airplane Restaurant\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo many restaurants are taking over spaces that were once used for different purposes and incorporating those origins into their d\u00e9cor. By paying tribute to their history, they create a richer dining experience, and something to talk about over your meal.\n\nHere are 10 places that have been transformed into restaurants where the food stands on its own but, like a diamond ring, is enhanced by a truly original setting.\n\nOh, if the walls could talk.\n\nCosima | Baltimore, Maryland\n\nCosima used to be a cotton mill \u2014 Photo courtesy of TPoz Photography\n\nIn 1847, Mill No. 1 was home to The Mount Vernon Company, the world\u2019s largest producer of cotton duck fabric. Today, its old boiler room is home to Cosima, one of Baltimore\u2019s best new restaurants, where you\u2019ll be treated like family and will feel like your mama was lovingly cooking for you \u2013 well, if your mama was beloved Executive Chef Donna Crivello (of Donna\u2019s Coffee Bar and Restaurant fame).\n\nTotally modern with a nod to both its culinary heritage and location, Cosima offers exquisite Sicilian and Southern Italian cuisine in a warm and inviting setting. Dine on the outdoor patio, which offers incredible views of the historic Jones Falls waterway and introduces a part of the city many Baltimoreans have never seen, adding a new chapter to its history.\n\nCirca 1886 | Charleston, South Carolina\n\nCirca 1886 at Wentworth Mansion used to be a carriage house \u2014 Photo courtesy of Circa 1886\n\nA Charleston favorite, this popular restaurant is located in the original carriage house of the historic Wentworth Mansion, one of the city\u2019s most award-winning and hospitable five-star hotels. Designed in the Second Empire style by architect Daniel D. Waynes, the grand mansion was built from 1865 to 1887, and was the family home of a wealthy businessman, his wife and 13 children.\n\nCirca 1886, long considered one of Charleston\u2019s finest restaurants, retains the spirit of the carriage house with stable doors and original heart-of-pine floors. Designed to mimic the carriage openings \u2013 which makes sense because the food is so good, you\u2019ll eat like a horse \u2013 cozy booths with candlelit tables are tucked into arched openings.\n\nBreakfast at Circa 1886 is exclusively for hotel guests, but everyone is welcome for dinner, when Executive Chef Marc Collins elevates Lowcountry cuisine to new heights.\n\nThe Airplane Restaurant | Colorado Springs, Colorado\n\nThe Airplane Restaurant is located in a real plane \u2014 Photo courtesy of Steve Kanatzar\n\nThis Boeing KC-97 tanker-turned-restaurant totally redefines the idea of airplane food, with an extensive menu offering everything from salads and sandwiches to steak and pasta. Built in 1953, the magnificent airplane refueled aircraft throughout the world. In 2002, it began refueling hungry diners.\n\nSpread out \u2013 only 42 guests can actually eat aboard the 275-seat restaurant \u2013 and let your imagination take flight as you explore aviation history through hundreds of photos, memorabilia and rare artifacts. Warning: Your experience on this plane may set a new standard that your next flight probably won\u2019t be able to meet.\n\nKatalina\u2019s | Columbus, Ohio\n\nKatalina's used to be a gas station \u2014 Photo courtesy of Katalina's, The Little Cafe with Lots of Local Goodness\n\nKatalina\u2019s, The Little Cafe with Lots of Local Goodness\u2122, is housed in a 100-year-old gas station \u2013 the oldest one in Columbus \u2013 and people are happily continuing the tradition of waiting in line to get filled up.\n\nThe neon around the building and on the \"parking\" sign are original but, instead of gas, Katalina\u2019s is now pumping out some of the city\u2019s best breakfast, brunch and lunch dishes, including their signature pancake balls. More than a million of them have been consumed to date, along with many gallons of locally-made Milligan\u2019s bourbon barrel aged maple syrup.\n\nHose 22 Firehouse Grill | Rochester, New York\n\nHose 22 Firehouse Grill used to be a firehouse \u2014 Photo courtesy of Hose 22 Firehouse Grill\n\nThe Hose 22 firehouse has been a Stutson Street fixture since 1916. It moved to a more modern facility in 1962 and stood empty for 47 years due to, ironically, a fire. In 2009, Rochester\u2019s 175th anniversary, Hose 22 Firehouse Grill opened, restoring and honoring an important piece of the city\u2019s history.\n\nUsing old photos, the restaurant was able to meticulously replicate the firehouse down to its fire poles and recognizable wrought iron balcony. The community generously donated historical photos and memorabilia in tribute to the brave firefighters who protected and served them.\n\nToday, Hose 22 is serving them everything from pizza and burgers to steak and seafood. There\u2019s no cause for alarm if the ribs \u2013 smoked fresh daily \u2013 run out because there are so many excellent back-up options to the rescue.\n\nThe Beauty Shop | Memphis, Tennessee\n\nThe Beauty Shop used to be, well, a beauty shop \u2014 Photo courtesy of The Beauty Shop\n\nThis kitschy Memphis restaurant was once \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a beauty shop. And not just any beauty shop but the one where Priscilla Presley used to get her beehive \u2018do done. Although Elvis may have left the building, many of the old-school salon details still take center stage here: sinks for washing hair adorn the bar, daily specials are written on the mirror and you can eat under a Belvedere dryer.\n\nIn case you think this is merely a fun themed restaurant, one bite of the watermelon and wings or heirloom tomato and challah toast will set you straight. This is sophisticated food with a Southern accent, bursting with flavor and originality, made by people who care deeply about their craft. Your taste buds will understand they've had a brush with greatness.\n\nDirty Habit | Washington, D.C.\n\nDirty Habit used to be the General Post Office \u2014 Photo courtesy of Dirty Habit\n\nDirty Habit, the Kimpton Hotel Monaco\u2019s buzzing \u2013 and buzzworthy \u2013 restaurant, is located in the former mail-sorting pavilion of Washington, D.C.\u2019s original General Post Office, which is where the Pony Express came to collect their packages. Constructed in 1839, it was the city\u2019s first all-marble building patterned after the Roman Temple of Jupiter.\n\nGuests enter the restaurant through the archway where the mail delivery team members would ride their horses to pick up and drop off mail. More than a century later, Executive Chef Kyoo Eom\u2019s innovative seasonal menu and Beverage Manager Drew Hairston\u2019s exciting bar program deliver an exceptional dining experience.\n\nTavern on the Green | New York City, New York\n\nThis 19th century sheephold is now Tavern on the Green \u2014 Photo courtesy of NYC Municipal Archives\n\nNew York\u2019s iconic restaurant started out in 1870 as a Gothic Revival sheephold housing 200 Southdown sheep. In 1934, the animals were banished to Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and the space became a much-heralded restaurant as part of a Robert Moses park renovation.\n\nThis landmark continues to make history as a New York staple, sitting in its place of honor in Central Park\u2019s Sheep Meadow. Tavern on the Green has been featured in classic movies like \"Wall Street\" and \"Beaches,\" and is such an important part of so many people\u2019s memories that they\u2019re actually compiling all of these tales in what will ultimately become a treasured book. Get in and create a chapter of your own.\n\nSign of the Whale | San Diego, California\n\nSign of the Whale used to be a jail \u2014 Photo courtesy of Kerry Helton\n\nDuring its storied history, \"San Diego\u2019s Grand Old Lady\" has been a city hall, a bank, a public library and a jailhouse. It\u2019s now a welcome addition to the downtown restaurant scene, with its Victorian fa\u00e7ade restored to closely resemble its original appearance. The first building in San Diego to be constructed entirely from local materials, the restaurant has kept many of the late 19th century elements intact.\n\nIn fact, downstairs, in Sign of the Whale\u2019s basement, The Brig pays homage to the space\u2019s former use as a jail, with beams and high ceilings all restored from the original building. What used to be cells and bars have been transformed into a much more welcoming bar and underground den that\u2019s only open after dark. You\u2019ll never have to worry about solitary confinement at this popular nightlife destination.\n\n5Church | Charleston, South Carolina\n\n5Church used to be a church \u2014 Photo courtesy of Explore Charleston\n\nSomehow, it just seems right that 5Church would open in the Holy City. Located, of course, in a historic church \u2013 the old Church of the Redeemer and Harriet Pickney Home for Seamen \u2013 the restaurant features stunning stained glass windows, high ceilings and food that may be the answer to your prayers.\n\nIts eclectic menu \u2013 sushi tots, Japanese fried chicken, peanut butter and jelly cinnamon rolls \u2013 will have you giving thanks and praising the chefs.", "description": "Gas stations, firehouses and beauty parlors are just a few of the places being transformed into unique restaurants.", "authors": ["Lois Alter Mark"], "top_image": "https://img2.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/371424/The-Airplane-Restaurant-with-sign_54_990x660.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
