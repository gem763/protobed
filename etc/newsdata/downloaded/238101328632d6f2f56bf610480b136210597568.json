(AP) - A central Illinois owner of an outfitter service has pleaded guilty to federal charges that included deploying an electronic bird caller to lure geese into shooting range.\n\nA statement from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Springfield says 58-year-old Rick A. Hamm, of Chillicothe, pleaded guilty Thursday to illegal sale of wildlife.\n\nHamm and several assistant guides were charged after taking undercover agents posing as hunters on a 2015 hunt in Fulton County.\n\nProsecutors say Hamm knew electronic callers violated conservation laws. They incorporate recordings of waterfowl to signal contentment at feeding grounds and can lead to excessive kills because they are so effective.\n\nHamm\u2019s sentencing is Jan. 9. An agreement calls for two years\u2019 probation, a $50,000 fine and $2,500 in restitution. On probation, Hamm will be barred from hunting.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A central Illinois owner of an outfitter service has pleaded guilty to federal charges that included deploying an electronic bird caller to lure geese into shooting range.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
