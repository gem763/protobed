REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s exports in September fell 3.2% from a year earlier,\n\ncustoms data showed on Monday, hurt by the intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war and weakening global demand.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected exports would decline 3%, after a 1% drop in August.\n\nImports in September fell 8.5% from a year earlier, more than a predicted drop of 5.2% and compared with a 5.6% contraction in August.\n\nThat left China with a trade surplus of $39.65 billion in September, compared with a $34.84 billion surplus in August. Analysts had forecast $33.3 billion.\n\nLast month saw a renewed escalation in a year-long trade row, with Washington imposing 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports from Sept. 1, and Beijing hitting back with retaliatory levies.\n\nFollowing talks last week, U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war and suspended a threatened tariff hike set for Oct. 15, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed.", "description": "China's exports in September fell 3.2% from a year earlier,", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440570183&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D05M", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
