REUTERS/Ali Hashisho\n\nThe drone is now in Hezbollah\u2019s possession, the group said in a statement.\n\nAn Israeli military statement said one of its drones \u201cfell inside southern Lebanon during routine operations\u201d. It did not say why the drone crashed, but said \u201cthere is no concern information could be taken from it\u201d. An Israeli military spokeswoman said it was a \u201csimple drone\u201d without elaborating.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters had used \u201cappropriate weapons\u201d to bring down the drone on the edge of the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah.\n\nReporting from the Israel-Lebanon border, a correspondent for Hezbollah\u2019s al-Manar television said the drone had not sustained much damage, and had been in Lebanese airspace for around five minutes.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Israeli military said Shi\u2019ite militias operating under the command of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, the overseas arm of Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, fired a number of rockets at Israel from Syria on Monday but they failed to hit Israeli territory.\n\nThe military said the rockets were launched from an area near Damascus.\n\nIsrael, which is alarmed by Iran\u2019s growing influence in the region through militia allies in countries including Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, says it has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria. It wants to stop Iran establishing a permanent military presence there and has struck against advanced weapon shipments to Hezbollah.\n\nAmid rising tensions in the region, Israel also raised the stakes last week by accusing Hezbollah, with Iranian assistance, of setting up a factory for precision-guided missiles in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa valley.\n\nHezbollah has denied having production sites in Lebanon, but says it does possess precision-guided missiles.\n\nDRONE ATTACK\n\nA week ago, after a drone attack in a Hezbollah-controlled Beirut suburb, Hezbollah and the Israeli army exchanged cross-border fire that marked their fiercest shelling exchange since the 2006 Lebanon war.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah blamed Israel for the drone attack and had vowed to target Israeli drones entering Lebanon\u2019s airspace.\n\nLebanon\u2019s government, which also blamed the drone attack on Israel, has repeatedly complained to the United Nations about Israel, which Beirut considers an enemy country, breaching its airspace.\n\nNasrallah said while last Sunday\u2019s flare-up with Israel at the border was over, the episode had launched a \u201cnew phase\u201d in which the Iran-backed group no longer had red lines it would not cross.\n\nIn that brief exchange of fire, Hezbollah said it destroyed an Israeli armoured vehicle, killing and wounding those inside, and broadcast what it said was footage of two missiles hitting a moving vehicle.\n\nIsrael said it had faked soldier casualties to dampen any inclination of Hezbollah to escalate hostilities.\n\nLast week\u2019s drone attacks and cross-border shelling came after Hezbollah, whose forces have fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s war, said two of its men were killed in an Israeli strike in Syria late last month.\n\nIsrael said its attack in Syria thwarted an Iran-led drone strike against it.\n\nA Reuters witness at the Lebanese border near where the drone fell said the area was calm on Monday morning.\n\nAny new war between Israel and Hezbollah would raise the risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East, at a time when Iran is defying U.S. attempts to force it to renegotiate a 2015 nuclear deal it reached with world powers.", "description": "Hezbollah said it downed an Israeli drone in southern Lebanon on Monday, in the latest flare-up raising tensions between the Iran-backed group and Israel, a week after the group's leader said it would shoot down Israeli drones in Lebanese airspace.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427898123&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880UG", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
