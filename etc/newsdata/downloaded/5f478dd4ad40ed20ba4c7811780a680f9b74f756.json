To equate his plight to lynching is grotesque.\"\n\nBut several Republican lawmakers defended Trump language as appropriate, and said the current impeachment process is in fact a lynching.\n\nRep. Bobby Rush, a black Democrat from Chicago, blasted Trump, asking the president, \"What the hell is wrong with you,\" and telling Trump to \"delete this tweet.\"\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, called Trump's tweet \"shocking.\"\n\n\"He is someone who doesn't understand history,\" Escobar said. \"An incredible disrespect to the country. It was awful. It was awful.\"\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a black Democrat currently seeking his party's presidential nomination, said on Twitter, \"Lynching is an act of terror used to uphold white supremacy. Try again.\"\n\nAnother Democratic presidential contender, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, said on Twitter, \"Lynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation's history, as is this President.\"\n\n\"We'll never erase the pain and trauma of lynching, and to invoke that torture to whitewash your own corruption is disgraceful,\" Harris said.\n\nFrom 1882 through 1968, according to the NAACP, there were at least 4,743 lynchings in the United States. Of those people killed, 3,446 \u2014 or nearly 73% \u2014 were black.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP's legal defense and education fund, said on Twitter, \"Mr. Trump's actions & words are consistent w/those who incited lynching, not its victims. And that fact makes this tweet particularly grotesque.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Hogan Gidley, when asked about Trump's language during an appearance on Fox News, said, \"I've not spoken with him directly about the tweet,\" but added, \"The president wasn't trying to compare himself to the horrific history in this country at all.\"\n\nGidley criticized the impeachment probe as \"an unfair, secretive process by the Democrats,\" and said the president has supported the black community with various economic and criminal justice initiatives.\n\nTrump is scheduled on Friday to deliver a keynote address at a bipartisan forum on criminal justice reform at Benedict College in South Carolina. Benedict is a historically black college.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said that Trump's use of the term to describe the impeachment inquiry was correct.\n\n\"This is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American,\" Graham told reporters.\n\n\"This is a sham, this is a joke,\" Graham said of the probe, criticizing the fact that Trump does not know the identity of the CIA whistleblower who raised concerns about his July call with Ukraine's president, the fact that Republican House members cannot call witnesses to testify, and \"that everything's being done behind closed doors.\"\n\nAsked whether he understood that black Americans would be offended by the term lynching, Graham said, \"No.\"\n\n\"I think lynching is being seen as somebody taking the law in their own hands and out to get somebody for no good reason,\" Graham said.\n\nGraham's fellow Republican senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott, who is one of just two black GOP members of Congress, said, \"There's no question that the impeachment process is the closest thing to a political death row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process.\"\n\nBut, Scott added, \"I wouldn't use the word lynching.\"\n\nScott last year introduced a bill with senators Booker and Harris to make lynching a federal hate crime.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said lynching is \"obviously a word with significant historical freight,\" according to a reporter from Politico.\n\nBut, Cruz added, \"The connotation the president is carrying forward is a political mob seeking an outcome regardless of facts,\" Cruz reportedly said.\n\n\"And that I think is an objectively true description of what is happening in the House right now.\"\n\nBoth Cruz and Graham represent states that had relatively large numbers of lynchings in the past. Texas had 493 lynchings from 1882 through 1968, and South Carolina had 160.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who like Trump is a Republican, called out the president for using the term lynching.\n\n\"We can all disagree on the process, and argue merits. But never should we use terms like 'lynching' here,\" Kinzinger wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"The painful scourge in our history has no comparison to politics, and @realDonaldTrump should retract this immediately. May God help us to return to a better way,\" Kinzinger said.\n\nHouse minority leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said of Trump's tweet, \"That's not the language I would use.\"\n\nMcCarthy said that while he does not believe Democrats are conducting a fair impeachment process, \"I don't agree with that language. It's pretty simple.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, declined to comment on Trump's language.\n\nThe House's impeachment probe was sparked by revelations that Trump had withheld congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine at the same time he was asking that country's new president in July to investigate a conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and to also probe former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nJoe Biden is currently seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukraine natural gas company at the time his father, as vice president, urged Ukraine to dismiss a prosecutor for not doing enough to fight corruption in that country. Trump has said Biden asked to protect his son from an investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified in a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals was set to hear arguments about whether federal judges can order the unsealing of normally secret records from grand juries in old cases that have historical significance. The case before the appeals court relates to the mob lynching of two black couples in rural Georgia in 1946.\n\nOn Monday, the fourth sign memoralizing the kidnapping, torture and lynching of 14-year Emmett Till in Mississippi was dedicated next to the river where his body was found in 1955. Till's admitted killers were found not guilty at trial, but his death \u2014 and his mother's decision to have an open-casket funeral that let mourners view his destroyed face \u2014 was a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Photos of the dead boy's face were published by Jet magazine and other black publications.\n\nThe first sign memorializing Till was torn down and thrown into the river, while the next two were shot up with bullets.\n\nThe new sign is made of steel, and according to its manufacturer is bulletproof.\n\n- Additional reporting by Jordan McDonald", "description": "A number of Democrats blasted President Donald Trump for using the term lynching to describe an impeachment probe, but Sen.
