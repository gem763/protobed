To Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company, it's one of the biggest drags on the company's overall profitability.\n\n\"GOOGL's margins are structurally under pressure owing to; a) rising competition; b) \"Techlash\" in the US; and c) increased regulatory scrutiny and fines globally,\" Martin wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet confirmed in early September that the Department of Justice is investigating the company over potential antitrust concerns.\n\nBut Martin has a potential solution. She says Alphabet should spin off part or all of YouTube in an effort to shrink itself and alleviate regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin estimates that YouTube is worth about $300 billion, based on estimated 2019 revenue of $30 billion and a 10-times enterprise-value-to-revenue multiple. That's roughly one-third of Alphabet's current market value, which is roughly $894 billion.\n\n\"Regulators have decided that 'big tech' is bad, based on a simplistic metric of market cap,\" Martin said. \"GOOGL spinning off 100% of YouTube into a $250-$350B market cap piece would result in each company being materially smaller.\"\n\nMartin also sees a YouTube spin-off creating value for investors in the following ways:\n\nPure-play assets \u2014 such as YouTube \u2014 typically demand a higher price because they help investors balance exposure to risk by business line.\n\nMore data would be available on each business in order to meet the \"materiality\" threshold, which relates to the significance of an amount, transaction, or discrepancy during the auditing process.\n\nEmployee retention could improve with stock options in a company employees believe they could impact.\n\nIncreased accountability for the executives of each business on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet reported earnings per share of $10.12, well below analysts estimates of $12.35.\n\nThe company said a decline in the value of its equity investments reduced earnings, as well as a $554 million charge to settle a tax dispute in France. Alphabet's profits also fell from $13.06 in earnings per share during the same period last year.\n\nThe company said ongoing strength in YouTube, mobile search, and cloud contributed to its 20% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nShares of Alphabet are up more than 23% year-to-date through Monday's close.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Google parent Alphabet reported third-quarter profits that missed Wall Street estimates on Monday.\u00a0  Some analysts expect the tech conglomerate's ea...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5db83b00dee019310e6c347b-2000/youtube.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
