My Facebook wall is full of celebration of this Nobel as a defeat of Modi-an \u201cVikas\u201d that masses (most surprisingly for Indian elites) opted for over free Rs 72000 landing in their pockets.\n\nAs one of the ill-informed persons who felt that NYAY was a disaster, this Nobel is a hard knock on my knuckles as Abhijit Banerjee has used \u201cexperimental approach\u201d, that too while sitting in Ivey league academies, where I suspect poor of the world flock to get studied.\n\nThe beauty of this process is that west aied by these great experts has been working hard at \u201calleviating global poverty\u201d since a long time, but, for the reason unknown (or because we are stupid), the only result is that they are getting richer and the rest of the world is getting poor.\n\nIt is only thanks to China that the poor-numbers are not looking that poor, as China has decided to do its own economics instead of using Ivey league wisdom (like India).\n\nIf I change the tone of this prose and get candid, the joke is on us and it should be hurting enough for us to wake up.\n\nThe world economics, the Nobel prizes and the Ivey league classes are not there to reduce our poverty. West has created all these institutions for only one purpose and that is a selfish purpose.\n\nIf west really wanted to solve the problem of poverty, it is clearly working at the wrong end of the economics.\n\nPoverty is NOT the problem.\n\nWestern greed and the obscene wealth created by it is the problem.\n\nThe economic theories of \u201calleviating global poverty\u201d are not aimed at removing poverty.\n\nThey are aimed ONLY at managing the poor for the benefit of the rich.\n\nWest knows that poor has to be managed just the right way so that there is no disruption and rich can carry on exploiting the poor in peace.\n\nWe as a nation are the worst suffers of this economic manipulation and we carry on being stupid to toe the western line. This Nobel celebration of a person of Indian origin is just a continuation of the fact that we have still not stepped out of the awe of the west.\n\nI am not sure that Indian culture is about being rich or poor, but if that is the real problem that we want to see getting solved, China is the greatest example for us to learn from.\n\n\u201cAccording to the World Bank, more than 850 million people have lifted themselves out of extreme poverty as China\u2019s poverty rate fell from 88 per cent in 1981 to 0.7 per cent in 2015.\u201d (Wikipedia) This was possible because China didn\u2019t look for western appreciation of its economic policies by hiring Ivey league experts on poverty. It did its own thinking.\n\nIf we want to follow China\u2019s suit, it will need ejecting the west-driven ideas, doing what is right for us instead of playing to the elite economists\u2019 galleries of Ivey league and having our home-grown economics.\n\nIt will surely mean that there will be a huge loss, as it will mean no Nobel Prize for us, but there is one small gain likely and that is reduction of the suffering of millions of Indian poor.", "description": "As a third class citizen of a third world nation, I always await the declaration of two Nobel prizes, of peace and economics (which I know is not exactly noble, sorry Nobel), as these two...", "authors": ["Samir Shukla"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/11.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
