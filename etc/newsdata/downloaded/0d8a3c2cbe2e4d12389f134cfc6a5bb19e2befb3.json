Tulsi Gabbard is the rare Democrat who opposes impeachment proceedings and comes from a district handily won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nFourteen House Democrats, many from congressional districts where President Donald Trump won in 2016, are still publicly withholding support for an impeachment inquiry following revelations the president pressured the Ukranian government into relaunching an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOf the 14 members, all but one are considered moderates, and all but one are Republican targets in the 2020 midterm elections. Eleven of them are serving their first term in Congress, and another won a special election in 2018. Most have said they believe impeaching Trump would be needlessly divisive and inflame political tensions, while others indicated impeachment must be a bipartisan process \u2014 an unlikely scenario \u2014 or said they were still seeking more information about Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cIf anyone thinks a partisan impeachment process would constrain President Trump, they are fooling themselves,\u201d Rep. Collin Peterson told the Detroit Lakes Tribune. \u201cWithout significant bipartisan support, impeachment proceedings will be a lengthy and divisive action with no resolution.\u201d\n\nPeterson, considered one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, represents a sprawling, agriculture-heavy district in western Minnesota that Trump won by 30 percentage points. Peterson himself won reelection by a 52% to 48% margin in 2018, and faces a stiff challenge from former GOP Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach in 2020.\n\nBesides Peterson, the 13 holdouts in HuffPost\u2019s count are: Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath, Texas Rep. Colin Allred, New York Rep. Anthony Brindisi, South Carolina Rep. Joe Cunningham, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Maine Rep. Jared Golden, Oklahoma Rep. Kendra Horn, Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind, Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb, Utah Rep. Ben McAdams, New York Rep. Max Rose, New Mexico Rep. Xochitl Torres Small and New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew.\n\nThe other moderates represent a broad swath of swing-to-conservative territory, mostly in suburban and rural America: Trump won the district represented by McBath, which covers the northern suburbs of Atlanta, by just 5,000 votes. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton actually won the Dallas-based district of Allred\u2019s, a former NFL linebacker, and Allred himself won it by six percentage points. Van Drew, a conservative former state legislator, won his seat centered around Atlantic City and the Philadelphia suburbs by eight percentage points after Trump won it by four points in 2016. Torres Small represents a rural border district in southern New Mexico, winning it by under 4,000 votes after a 14,000-vote Trump triumph two years earlier.\n\nCunningham, who represents Charleston and the rest of coastal South Carolina, also tried to distance himself from a congressional leadership that is all-in on an impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve warned members of my own party that a partisan rush to impeach the President would be bad for the country,\u201d he told McClatchy.\n\nOf the impeachment process opponents, one stands out: Gabbard, a 2020 presidential candidate who represents a district Clinton won by 32 percentage points in 2018.\n\n\u201cI believe that impeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country at a time when we are already extremely divided,\u201d she said on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Tuesday. \u201cThe hyperpartisanship is one of the main things driving our country apart.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who is polling in the single digits and is struggling to make the stage at the next Democratic presidential debate, has long embraced views and taken actions considered unorthodox or fringe in the party.\n\nBut Gabbard, a military veteran who was once considered a rising star in the party, is also facing a potential primary challenge in her home district in Hawaii. State Sen. Kai Kahele, who already has the endorsement of three former Democratic governors in the state, highlighted his support for Hawaii Democrats who back impeachment in a tweet Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cAfter reading the 5 page Ukraine call memo and watching President Trump\u2019s unhinged & rambling press conference today, it is more clear than ever that the House must move swiftly with its impeachment inquiry,\u201d Kahele wrote on Twitter Wednesday.", "description": "Many are from districts that backed Trump in 2016.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8cf22a22000058005293ab.jpeg?cache=s8ajo0mmge&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
