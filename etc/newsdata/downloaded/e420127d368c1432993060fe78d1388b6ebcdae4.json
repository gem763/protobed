It was a Saturday morning and she\u2019d traveled with her boyfriend three hours from Amsterdam to a city called Groningen, up in the northern, marshy end of the Netherlands. And there she was making small talk in the MRI lab of a hospital with three male scientists when she suddenly had a thought.\n\n\u201cI realised I was the only woman in the room,\u201d she recalls, and describes a pang of exasperation. \u201cIt was like, of course I\u2019m the only woman in a study about women\u2019s bodies!\u201d\n\nIda had agreed to participate in the project partly as a favour, but mostly because she was a passionate anthropologist who\u2019d spent her youth campaigning for women\u2019s rights. And while the room\u2019s asymmetrical gender balance annoyed her, it also got her moving, and she clapped a hand over her boyfriend\u2019s back. \u201cSo!\u201d she announced, \u201cshall we get on with it then?\u201d\n\nThe three scientists jumped to attention, along with her boyfriend Jupp, who hurried off to the bathroom to pee. One of the scientists removed the retractable steel tray from the MRI, then Ida and Jupp undressed and clambered in naked. Originally Jupp was supposed to lay on top of Ida, missionary-style, but Ida baulked at the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a position that for me produces hardly any arousal,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnyway, Jupp would have been too heavy in that tiny tube.\u201d And so they wriggled around into a spooning position, ass to groin.\n\nThe three male researchers headed into the MRI operator\u2019s booth to watch through a thick plate of glass. \u201cCan you hear us?\u201d asked one of them through an intercom wired into the bowels of the MRI. \u201cYes,\u201d came Ida\u2019s reply, followed by giggling from Jupp. \u201cReady when you are.\u201d\n\nThese days Ida is a Professor of Organisational Anthropology at Amsterdam\u2019s Vrije University. All photos by the author\n\n\n\nA year earlier, in the autumn of 1991, Ida had received a phone call from her best friend\u2019s partner, a guy named Menko Victor \u201cPek\u201d van Andel. Ida and Pek had always gotten along, but Ida considered Pek a bit of an eccentric, so she took the call with raised eyebrows.\n\nOver the phone Pek explained he had an idea for a very special and highly original piece of \u201cbody art.\u201d That is, he wanted to create an image of the female reproductive tract during coitus, using a magnetic resonance imagery machine, commonly known as an MRI machine. Like X-rays, these machines allow doctors to see inside human bodies without surgery\u2014but no one, according to Pek, had ever used one to see inside the female body during intercourse. \u201cIt\u2019s never been done!\u201d he repeated over the line. \u201cNever!\u201d\n\nIda was sceptical but intrigued. Pek might have been eccentric, but he also had a degree in medical research and had co-invented an artificial cornea. He had the connections to source an MRI machine, but more importantly, the academic gravitas to ensure the project wouldn\u2019t become porn. And so after some consideration, and a long conversation with Jupp, she agreed.\n\nPek outside his farmhouse near Groningen\n\nPek was correct when he said no one had used an MRI to examine female internal sexual organs, but others had certainly tried using their imaginations. The most famous early example was Leonardo da Vinci, who sometime between 1492 and 1494 sketched an illustration of a man pushing his erection into a semi-transparent vagina. The woman\u2019s body and face don\u2019t appear in the drawing, only her reproductive tract, which appeared as an undeviating cylinder leading between her legs directly to the base of her spine.\n\nThis sketch was created around 500 years ago, but we\u2019ve stuck by its basic shape ever since. Nearly all diagrams found on tampon boxes and in sex-ed books depict the vagina as a straight tunnel. Penises aren\u2019t forced to bend around corners, or conform to the female form in any way. They just go in straight and come straight out, as da Vinci had assumed. But no one had ever actually fact-checked his sketch with an MRI, so no one knew if da Vinci was correct.\n\nPek holds up a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's sketch from the 1490s\n\nBack in the lab, Ida and Jupp\u2019s bodies were completely enveloped by the MRI scanner with only their feet protruding. Jupp was understandably worried he wouldn\u2019t get an erection, but Ida wiggled an arm around to find that wasn\u2019t a problem. Then they squirmed into place and, as Ida describes, \u201cit became pleasantly warm in the tube and we truly succeeded in enjoying each other in a familiar way.\u201d\n\nFrom time to time an instruction would crackle through the intercom and they\u2019d both burst into laughter. \"The erection is fully visible, including the root,\" someone would say from the control room. \u201cHold that pose.\u201d And then trying not to laugh Jupp and Ida would try to lay completely still, Jupp inside Ida, as the MRI machine clanged around them.\n\nWe won\u2019t go into a complete description of an MRI\u2019s operation. Suffice to say, they\u2019re essentially large plastic boxes filled with metal coils. The machine\u2019s opening runs down the coils\u2019 centre axis, which are spasmodically magnetised with an electrical current, causing the coils to shiver and thump. An MRI machine making a scan is like a box full of charged hula-hoops jumping around and clanging together, making it probably the loudest piece of medical equipment in existence. And Ida and Jupp made love in the midst of all that noise, pausing intermiddly to hold a pose\u2014while Jupp tried to hold his erection\u2014until finally after about 45 minutes they were told to \u201cfinish up.\u201d And they did.\n\nAfterwards they were withdrawn from the machine, naked and sweaty \u201clike buns from an oven.\u201d Ida and Jupp then dressed and hurried to the control room to see the images they\u2019d created.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw them it was just like aww that\u2019s how we fit together, says Ida. \u201cThey were beautiful! I could see my womb and then there was Jupp in a place that I knew from my own sensation, just below the cervix. There was very clear features of both our insides, including the boundary between both our bellies. It showed so much detail it made me speechless.\u201d\n\nThe MRI scan. On the left the scan is unlabeled, on the right the various body parts are highlighted and labeled. The penis is marked \"P\" with the balls marked \"Sc.\" Ida's uterus is marked \"U\" while her bladder is \"B\"\n\nOne person in the room who wasn\u2019t speechless was Pek van Andel. Looking at the scan he immediately saw that Jupp\u2019s penis had been forced into a curved, boomerang shape. From inside Jupp\u2019s own body, it assumed an angle of about 120 degrees, which was something Leonardo da Vinci had never drawn. And at that moment Pek knew they\u2019d achieved something more significant than an arts project; they\u2019d re-written around 500 years of anatomical assumptions.\n\nHowever, as with a lot of art and science, both Ida and Pek immediately found themselves up against the winds of public outrage. Pek\u2019s preliminary scans and findings were mailed to Nature, with Ida as co-author, only to be rebuffed without explanation. Then the Dutch tabloids got the story and implied that sick, helpless people had been made to wait for life-saving scans while Pek was squandering MRI equipment on frivolous sleaze. This wasn\u2019t true, as they\u2019d used the lab out of hours, but in any case, the hospital hurriedly backed off, which in turn denied Pek the opportunity to replicate the experiment. And that meant that a more thorough, scientific study was impossible.\n\n\u201cIt was completely disappointing,\u201d says Pek. \u201cWe\u2019d found an unexplored area of research, and no one wanted to let us finish the work because they were afraid of how it would look on their resumes.\u201d\n\nPek however, was not dissuaded. After deciding that a thorough study involving multiple couples was in order, he spent the next few months lobbying Groningen Hospital\u2019s management until both the head of women's medicine and head of radiology greenlit the idea, providing it was completed in secret and no one published anything. Pek agreed, assuming he\u2019d cross the hurdle on \u201cpublication\u201d once he got there.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1999, eight couples and three single women had sex in the hospital\u2019s MRI a total of 13 times. These subsequent experiments were all done in the missionary position, using volunteers above the age of 18 who were told they could quit at any moment. No one did, but as Ida points out\u2014somewhat smuggly\u2014none of the men were later able to complete the test without viagra.\n\n\u201cWe were the only couple to successfully do it without viagra,\u201d she says, proudly. \u201cFor me, the experiment was also a testimony to mine and Jupp\u2019s happiness. I think that\u2019s something the paper missed: how connected a couple must be to perform under those kinds of conditions.\u201d\n\nPek displays his creation in a field outside his home\n\nFinally, after eight years and three failed submissions, the British Medical Journal published their paper on the inauspicious date of December 24, 1999. The paper was titled Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Male and Female Genitals During Coitus and Female Sexual Arousal, and to this day Ida and Pek say it\u2019s the scientific work for which they\u2019ve both received the most citations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably become my legacy,\u201d admits Ida, who is now a Professor of Organisational Anthropology at Amsterdam\u2019s Vrije University. \u201cBut I\u2019m lucky. You don\u2019t get to choose your legacy, and some people don\u2019t get one at all.\u201d\n\nAside from its observations on bent penises, the paper uncovered something else that was truly unexpected: namely, the effect sex has on the female bladder. As many women can attest, there\u2019s something about vaginal sex that prompts the bladder to rapidly fill, as observed in every female participant over the course of the 13 experiments. And to this day scientists still aren\u2019t sure why.\n\n\u201cIn every final scan we could see a big, full bladder, even though most of the women went to the toilet before they went inside the MRI,\u201d explains Pek with comical astonishment. \u201cWe think it might be evolution\u2019s way to force women to urinate after sex. Perhaps our ancestors developed this function to avoid urinary tract infections, but that\u2019s only a hypothesis.\u201d\n\nToday, Pek is retired and lives with his partner in a sprawling farmhouse in the Dutch countryside. He says he\u2019s proud of the study, even though he says it inadvertently revealed to him a kind of cowardice inherent to scientific study. He describes how after the 1999 paper was lauded by Science magazine, everyone who\u2019d previously wanted nothing to do with them suddenly clamoured for credit.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019d actively tried to shut us down were later providing quotes to the press, or listing their participation on their resumes,\u201d Pek clucks, shaking his head. \u201cSuccess has many fathers, obviously.\u201d\n\nIda says she also discovered something frustrating about human nature, which was how everyone got so hung up on sex. To this day she says her friends and family still laugh about the time she shagged her boyfriend in an MRI, even though many are tertiary-educated adults approaching retirement. In particular she finds this reaction odd around the university, where her giggly colleagues are academics working in social sciences in one of the world\u2019s most progressive cities.\n\n\u201cIn many ways I think we\u2019re going backwards,\u201d Ida says. \u201cI grew up in a time when sex wasn\u2019t a big deal, and we\u2019d always go bathing naked and people seemed more open minded. Now, people just seem to be getting more and more conservative.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Ida says she\u2019s incredibly proud of the small contribution she made towards gender equality in the science of arousal. She had no idea what she was getting herself into that morning in 1991, but she\u2019s incredibly happy she went ahead with it. Even if the experiment was mostly run by men.\n\nFollow Julian on Twitter and Instagram", "description": "In 1991 scientists created an internal image of the human body during sex.
