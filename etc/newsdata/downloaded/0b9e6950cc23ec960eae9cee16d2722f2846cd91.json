It has cut interest rates tmsnrt.rs/32KbNrP aggressively from 24% since July to help revive Turkey's recession-hit economy after last year's currency crisis.\n\nSome economists were surprised by the sharp easing move after two weeks of lira volatility related to Turkey\u2019s attack on Kurdish-led forces in northeastern Syria, which drew international condemnation and threats of repercussions.\n\nA Reuters poll had predicted a cut of 100 points.\n\nBut the central bank said inflation would likely decline more than it had expected by year end after a \u201csignificant fall\u201d in September, and it repeated guidance that the policy stance was \u201cto a large part\u201d consistent with that path.\n\nExpectations for monetary easing were initially curtailed after troops crossed the Syrian border on Oct. 9, hitting the currency and prompting U.S. sanctions over Turkey\u2019s attacks on Kurdish forces that were once U.S. allies.\n\nBut the lira, which plunged 30% last year, recouped some losses after Washington opted last week for a light set of sanctions, re-opening the door to the rate cut. It rallied again on Wednesday when U.S. President Donald Trump canceled them and said a ceasefire had been reached.\n\n\u201cThey were definitely encouraged by the lifting of sanctions,\u201d Piotr Matys, emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank, said of Turkish central bankers.\n\n\u201cIt was a positive move and it increased the room for maneuver, but not enough to justify a cut of 250 basis points.\u201d\n\nCRISIS IN REAR VIEW MIRROR\n\nThe Turkish lira slipped 0.7% against the dollar, to 5.7725, after the bank\u2019s third rate cut in as many policy meetings, totaling 1,000 basis-points of easing.\n\n(Graphic: Turkey's central bank cuts key rate, again, here)\n\nThe policy rate is now nearly as low as early last year, before the crisis hit and tipped the Middle East\u2019s largest economy into recession, sent inflation soaring above 25%, and prompted aggressive monetary tightening.\n\nInflation has since eased, reaching 9.26% in September. In its latest forecast, the central bank expected it to accelerate to 13.9% by year-end once the so-called base effects have worn off.\n\nBut on Thursday the bank said \u201crecent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize notably below the projections\u201d by year end.\n\nWhile the central bank has said it is targeting a reasonable real interest rate, an FX desk manager at a Turkish bank said it would sharply narrow as annual inflation rebounds in November and December.\n\nAt that time, \u201cit might cause a significant risk on the Turkish lira,\u201d the manager said. \u201cBut the market does not choose to price this risk today.\u201d\n\nSYRIA EFFECT\n\nThe monetary boost comes as Turkey takes other steps to strengthen its economy including preparing a 2020 budget that an official said was \u201cflexible\u201d and could be expanded for the military.\n\nReuters reported that the Treasury is also crafting legislation to transfer into the budget $17 billion from a central bank fund.\n\nTo limit the lira\u2019s fall this month, Turkish state banks have sold billions of dollars and trimmed funding in an offshore swap market, according to traders.\n\nSelva Demiralp, director of the Koc University-TUSIAD Economic Research Forum in Istanbul, said the rate cut was also meant in part to strengthen the economy given the military effort, adding: \u201cBut I am not sure it will work.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeposit rates and loan rates already declined as low as they can go given the inflation rate,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they would defend the economy better if they didn\u2019t touch the policy rate.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump rolled back sanctions applied a week earlier on some top Turkish officials and ministries.\n\nYet many U.S. lawmakers want a tougher response including one bill that would impose \u201ccrippling\u201d sanctions on Ankara. Separately, U.S. prosecutors last week charged Turkey\u2019s Halkbank in a move the state bank said was tied to Syria-related sanctions.\n\nThe military incursion could also draw European Union sanctions.", "description": "Turkey's central bank slashed its policy rate more than expected to 14% on Thursday, taking advantage of an inflation dip and a steadier lira after Washington canceled just-announced sanctions over Ankara's military incursion into northeast Syria.", "authors": ["Ezgi Erkoyun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
