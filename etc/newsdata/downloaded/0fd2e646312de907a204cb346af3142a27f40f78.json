The company's Matrix chat software is already in use by the French government and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) \u2014 the world's third-largest employer.\n\nThe startup, founded in 2017, received the funding from Notion Capital, Dawn Capital, and Firstminute Capital, having previously raised a $5 million seed round in January 2018.\n\n\"We want to do for communication what bitcoin did for finance by decentralizing away from Google and Facebook and one day we will be as accessible as WhatsApp or Slack,\" Hodgson told Business Insider in an interview. \"This fundraising is the result of six months of hard work, and we're very happy with the result.\"\n\nUnder New Vector's decentralized system, users own and control the data they transmit \u2014 unlike in a traditional centralized system in which an organization like Facebook owns user data. The startup says this makes the product more secure and less susceptible to privacy concerns.\n\nThe company has worked with 16 ministries within the French government to bring its staff onto the Matrix system, and it plans on expanding its product offering going forward. New Vector is entirely based on open-source software.\n\nYou can check out the company's 19-slide (redacted) pitch deck that it used to lure in investment from prominent venture-capital firms here:", "description": "New Vector raised an $8.5 million Series A funding round to expand as it looks to take on competitors WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack.", "authors": ["Callum Burroughs"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da090a6cc4a0a241511ba03?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
