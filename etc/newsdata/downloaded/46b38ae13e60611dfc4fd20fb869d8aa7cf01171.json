It will be sold starting Thursday, they say, only in South Korea.\n\nThe phone won\u2019t differ in hardware, or packaging, from the two sizes of the Galaxy Note 10 that hit shelves last month, and is expected to be sold at similar prices, according to the people, which start at around $1,000.\n\nBut this newest edition will show Klaytn\u2019s logo when it is turned on or off, and come installed with blockchain apps and a wallet for cryptocurrencies, the people said. Buyers will get a certain amount of a new digital currency, called \u201cKlay\u201d coins, to use, they said.\n\nBlockchain relies on encryption to cloak a range of transaction data, from digital-currency ownership to supply-chain operations. Enthusiasts view the technology as a potential game-changer in an era of cybersecurity breaches, data-privacy concerns and distrust of institutions from governments to large tech companies.\n\nThe KlaytnPhone marks Samsung\u2019s deepest foray into blockchain, a technology that has been slow to catch on and that few people understand. Samsung is joining with Ground X Corp., which created the Klaytn platform and is the blockchain affiliate of South Korea\u2019s largest messaging-app operator, Kakao Corp.\n\nA Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment. Ground X says the company is committed to bringing blockchain technology to everyday life.\n\nSeparately, Samsung said another product would hit shelves Friday in South Korea: the Galaxy Fold, which folds like a book and boasts a tablet-sized screen. The launch of the roughly $2,000 device\u2014the mainstream industry\u2019s first such handset\u2014was delayed in April after tech reviewers discovered design flaws.\n\nSamsung first waded into blockchain in March with another flagship device, the Galaxy S10. At the time it didn\u2019t explicitly release a blockchain-themed variant. But certain models of the Galaxy S10 and some previously released versions of the Galaxy Note 10 came with a feature that lets users safely store and use cryptocurrencies through a security feature that operates separately from the rest of the device.\n\nThe blockchain apps running on Klaytn\u2019s platform are accessible on non-Samsung smartphones using Google\u2019s Android operating system. But only the Klaytn edition will boast the blockchain platform\u2019s full breadth of transaction services, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSamsung\u2019s blockchain-customized Galaxy Note 10 variant won\u2019t be the first smartphone that aims to lower barriers to use blockchain technology. Both Taiwan\u2019s HTC Corp. and Switzerland-based Sirin Labs launched blockchain-enabled phones last year.\n\nBlockchain enthusiasts believe adoption could grow if hardware companies, like Samsung, offer ready-made blockchain ecosystem, such as pre-installed apps and security features. It would simplify a process that is often cumbersome and confusing, and offer consumers more security, the enthusiasts say.\n\nEdith Yeung, a managing partner at Proof of Capital, a venture-capital fund, compared the current awareness of blockchain-equipped handsets with consumers\u2019 understanding of smartphones when Apple Inc. launched its first iPhone, more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the original iPhone era, where people are asking, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nEven if Samsung\u2019s blockchain phone takes off, it won\u2019t be a big sales driver as South Korea makes up a fraction of its total business. Seoul-based brokerage CSLA forecast in August the company will sell around 10 million Galaxy Note 10 devices world-wide.\n\nWrite to Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com", "description": "Samsung is releasing a variant of its newest flagship phone meant to boost adoption of blockchain\u2014a tall task for a technology that still puzzles many consumers.", "authors": ["Eun-Young Jeong", "Eun-Young.Jeong Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104108/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
