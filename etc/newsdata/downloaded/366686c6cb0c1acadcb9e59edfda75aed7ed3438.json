Because of its claimed status, Korea is allowed by the WTO to give subsidies to farmers that amount to 1.49 trillion won ($1.27 billion) a year.A government meeting with agriculture groups to discuss the matter on Tuesday failed to proceed beyond opening remarks after protests from farmers and farming organizations.Senior officials have called for calm, saying that a change in Korea\u2019s status wouldn\u2019t lead to any immediate changes.Hong has previously explained that giving up the status would not impact any of the current benefits afforded through the WTO as they are subject to change only in future negotiations.Agriculture Minister Kim Hyeon-soo acknowledged during his confirmation hearing in August that it would be difficult for Korea to maintain the status.Farmers are still wary of losing the distinction.The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, commonly known as Nonghyup, expressed opposition to Korea giving up the status earlier this month.\u201cIf the government gives up the developing country status [\u2026] there will likely be great losses through deep cuts to tariffs and subsidies if the next WTO trade negotiations progress and reach a deal,\u201d said the organization in a statement.This year, Taiwan and Brazil said they will no longer seek benefits given to developing countries, while the United Arab Emirates and Singapore have made similar announcements.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
