(The Odessa shooter used an AR-15, a weapon that has become commonplace in mass shootings.)\n\n\u201cThey are not buying them back,\u201d Carlson grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s gun confiscation. Nothing but that. An attempt to eliminate a constitutional right the ruling class finds inconvenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t reduce gun violence,\u201d the right-wing cable news host continued. \u201cIn fact, sending armed authorities door-to-door to seize people\u2019s lawfully owned weapons is a sure-fire recipe for causing violence. If you cared about America and the people who live here, you would not suggest that. But they don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d\n\nCarlson went on to grouse some more over Democrats pointing the finger at firearms and high-capacity magazines and clips as a root cause of America\u2019s gun violence problem, bringing on a former Army ranger to back up his criticisms. The Fox host then brought on Democratic strategist Bernard Whitman to debate the merits of buybacks and gun reform in general, resulting in a predictably heated exchange.\n\nAfter Whitman pointed out that the vast majority of American citizens support universal background checks\u2014the Odessa shooter failed a federal background check\u2014Carlson pivoted back to buybacks, insisting they would result in war.\n\n\u201cWhat you are calling for is civil war,\u201d Carlson exclaimed, noting that several 2020 candidates support buybacks. \u201cWhat you are calling for is an incitement to violence. It\u2019s something\u2014I wouldn\u2019t want to live here when that happened, would you?!\u201d\n\nThe Fox host went on to allege that this was really about the ruling class punishing and attacking rural America, adding that \u201cthere is no violent crime in most places where everyone owns a gun.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
