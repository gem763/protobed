During a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that took place this summer, Trump is said to have asked for help investigating former vice president Biden and his son, Hunter, a total of eight times.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Boom! I got you, Business Daddy! I got you! You genuinely bad company.\u201d His joke was in reference to HBO\u2019s parent company, which has become the subject of frequent swipes on the show.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Trump has denied the accusation but acknowledged he blocked the funds, which were later released.\n\nOliver commented: \u201cWe called his Russia scandal \u2018Stupid Watergate\u2018, which unfortunately means we now have to work out what the sequence should be called... \u2018Stupid Watergate II: Look Who\u2019s Stupid Now (The Same Guy)\u2019... \u2018S2pid Watergate\u2019... \u2018Stwopid Watergate\u2019.\u201d Oliver eventually decided he preferred: \u201cStupid Watergate II: The Stupidest Watergate.\u201d\n\nHe then observed how the White House initially denied any wrongdoing and released its own account of the phone call with Ukraine, which did not exonerate Trump. He also referred to the whistleblower\u2019s allegation that the White House had tried to cover up the call.\n\n\u201cThe notes from the call were stored in a separate code-word level system for highly classified information, despite the fact that there was no legitimate reason to do that... and why do that, if there wasn\u2019t something very bad in there?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want someone to see something on your computer, everyone knows you put it in a folder labelled \u2018finance records\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe went on comment on how, while some may believe that \u201cnothing Trump does ever affects him\u201d, \u201cpeople seem legitimately furious over this\u201d. His final observation on the Ukraine segment of the show was that, while the Russia scandal involved allegations by Trump towards another presidential candidate, \u201cthis involves him abusing the powers of the presidency\u201d.\n\nOther late-night TV spots have taken aim at Trmup and the threat of an impeachment inquiry. In Saturday Night Live\u2019s cold open, Alec Baldwin\u2019s Donald Trump asked for impeachment advice from celebrities including Kanye West (Chris Redd), Judge Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), and fictional fixer Ray Donovan (Liev Schreiber).\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "John Oliver has weighed in after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry against US president Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/05/09/john-oliver-hbo.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
