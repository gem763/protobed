And when we left the subway, there it was, seemingly untouched, right on the table where he had left it.\n\nBuoyed by our good fortune, we decided not to go straight home. We took a walk in Central Park and then had supper.", "description": "A night out after a lucky break, a lovely puddle and more reader tales of New York City in this week\u2019s Metropolitan Diary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/nyregion/01diary-4/01diary-4-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
