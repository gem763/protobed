In response, Aaron had launched an especially nasty attack on his brother, dredging up rape and abuse allegations against Nick as ammunition.\n\nOne of the tweets Aaron posted after he revealed he had been served with the restraining order said, \u201cI have never been accused of rape multiple times. I wasn\u2019t accused of beating Paris Hilton. Who\u2019s VIOLENT?\u201d\n\nI have never been accused of rape mutiple times I wasn\u2019t accused of beating of @parishilton who\u2019s VIOLENT? #Coverup #CrazyLikeAFox \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nOf course, that\u2019s directed at Nick, who denied physically abusing Hilton in 2004 after the socialite was photographed with a fat lip and bruises on her arms. Page Six reported at the time that Hilton told a friend that Carter had hit her. The pair, who were on and off for 10 months, split for good. Carter downplayed any drama in his 2013 book, Facing the Music and Living to Talk About It, saying that they were just a bad match because he was struggling with drug dependency and she \u201cfed my worst impulses as far as partying.\u201d\n\nHilton hasn\u2019t publicly replied to Aaron\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe rape allegations were in the news more recently. As #MeToo unfolded, Melissa Schuman, who was in the girl group Dream, accused him of rape. He denied it. There were no charges against Nick because the statute of limitations has expired.\n\nAt the time of Schuman\u2019s allegation, it was also surfaced that he was accused of sexual assault in 2003 by an unidentified minor, who was 15 at the time, but the case was never prosecuted.\n\nAaron has been using all these allegations in his public fight with his brother. In one tweet, he suggested that the restraining order, which also covers their sister Angel, was retaliation for Aaron siding with Nick\u2019s accusers.\n\nI know you\u2019re mad I spoke to @MelissaSchuman so to retaliate you call the police to take away my legal guns and you file a restraining order #pathetic #Coverup \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nAaron went on to put a bunch of women on blast, saying they all know the truth and can speak out when they\u2019re ready. In addition to naming Hilton and Schuman, he cited singers Kaya Jones (from the Pussycat Dolls) and Willa Ford, and makeup artist Tanya Jane.\n\nParis knows the truth. She can talk out when she\u2019s ready @KayaJones knows the truth, she can talk out when she\u2019s ready. Mandy WillaFord knows the truth she can talk out when she\u2019s ready. @MelissaSchuman she can speak out when she\u2019s ready. @TanyaJaneMUA knows the truth. https://t.co/JbiwjsYS4i \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nAnd another tweet, calling on Rose McGowan to help him expose Nick\u2019s \u201ccover up,\u201d mentioned Ashley Repp, who claims she was the unidentified minor from the 2003 police report.\n\nWhere is @rosemcgowan when you need her!! #CoverUp I\u2019m here for these women!! @AshleyRepp @MelissaSchuman right by there side and I\u2019m using my platform to help these women feel #Brave \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nSome more of Aaron\u2019s inflammatory tweets:\n\nHow come my brother didn\u2019t file a restraining orders against a girl who filed a police report against him for rape? #COVERUP #METOOMOVEMENT https://t.co/Wz7ug1BDaH \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nShe was 15 and I was there! Its statutory rape #CoverUp https://t.co/zEvL1NJTvJ \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nHey love, @MelissaSchuman I\u2019m not sorry that I spoke to you. Clearly my brother is sorry I spoke to you and is retaliating against me. #CoverUp #IGotYourBack #Metoomovement \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nAnybody who knows me knows I wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly I\u2019ve never been accused of rape I\u2019ve never been accused of beating @ParisHilton how am I the violent one. \u2014 Aaron Carter (@aaroncarter) September 18, 2019\n\nAaron also called for tagged investigative journalist Aphrodite Jones to do an \u201cR.
