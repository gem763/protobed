Admits To Having Sex More Than 4 Times In One Night In This Sour Candy Challenge", "language": "en", "text": "From Delish\n\nThe Bachelorette and Dancing With the Stars' Hannah Brown visits Delish to play Suck It Up. She answers \"Never have I ever...\" questions about her sex life, what went on behind the scenes, and her food choices\u2014all while eating the most sour candy you can buy.\n\nNever have I ever...had a crush on my dance partner.\n\nI haven't had a crush on my dance partner because I don't even know my dance partner for Dancing With the Stars, if that's what we're talking about. Maybe I will have a crush on my dance partner! We shall see! You should watch! And you should vote! For me!\n\nNever have I ever...missed Luke P.\n\nNo. No. One more time for the people in the back\u2014no.\n\n\n\nNever have I ever...eaten at Cracker Barrel.\n\nCome on! Of course I've eaten at Cracker Barrel. I'm from Alabama. That's where we have Easter! Just kidding.\n\nNever have I ever...used food during foreplay.\n\nExactly what do you mean by \"using food?\" I feel like I probably have. I'm sorry. I feel like there was one time I might've used the usuals...sticky stuff and creams [laughs].\n\nNever have I ever...pooped my pants as an adult.\n\nClose calls, but I've not pooped my pants as an adult.\n\nNever have I ever...faked sick to get out of a date.\n\nI have absolutely done this. It wasn't faking, but maybe I've been tired and thought \"I don't feel the best.\" I'll take a candy.\n\nNever have I ever...had sex more than four times in one night.\n\n[Eats candy.] Oh, this one's not that sour? Oh. There it goes. You should not eat these in public.\n\nNever have I ever...slid into a former Bachelor's DMs.\n\nI totally have. But it was before I was on the show and it was actually Colton. We're cool now, so I wonder if he even knows this. I would watch the show when he was on Becca's season or on Paradise and be like \"Oh my god, he's so cute,\" and I would be like \"Oh, mom, don't you just love Colton!?\" And I would tag him, but I wouldn't like slide into his DMs like \"Hey boy, you're so hot.\" Not like that. So. That's my life.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "Oh, and she does not miss Luke P.", "authors": ["Tess Koman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yKvoxtFBwjDPf0c77OfepA--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/fae9306af1fc226e18a287df4e5f4c7b", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
