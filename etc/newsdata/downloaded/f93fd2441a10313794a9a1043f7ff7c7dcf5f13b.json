Should Mr. Gantz emerge as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu would not be able to use Parliament to try to block a threatened indictment. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit \u2014 a Netanyahu appointee \u2014 has scheduled a hearing on whether to charge him with three counts of fraud and breach of trust and one of bribery for Oct. 2 and 3.\n\nMr. Netanyahu has also failed so far in this round to get Mr. Trump\u2019s blessing. The White House response to his pledge to annex the Jordan Valley, nearly a third of the West Bank, was that there is \u201cno change in United States policy at this time,\u201d possibly because Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, plan to reveal their long-promised Middle East peace plan soon after the Israeli election.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, moreover, has lost a strong ally in John Bolton, the national security adviser pushed out this week, and Mr. Trump\u2019s evident willingness to meet with Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, puts him at odds with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s unrelenting hostility toward Tehran. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s hope to get a boost from his meeting with Mr. Putin on Thursday was also blunted when Russia reacted frostily to his plan to annex the Jordan Valley, warning that this would \u201csharply escalate tensions in the region.\u201d\n\nThat it would, and for no good reason. The Israeli military establishment, Israeli public opinion and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s challenger in the election, Mr. Gantz, a retired three-star general, have long held that Israel must retain military control of the Jordan Valley for some period after a peace treaty is signed, effectively maintaining a buffer between the Palestinians and Arab lands to the east. The valley, currently home to about 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 Jewish settlers, remained under Israeli military control under the Oslo peace accords signed in 1993.\n\nBut outright annexation would be a blatant violation of international norms and an affront to the Palestinians that would snuff what glimmer of possibility remains for a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "description": "Cornered and desperate, the Israeli prime minister threatens to annex occupied territories and attacks the media, the judiciary and political foes.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12bib1/12bib1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
