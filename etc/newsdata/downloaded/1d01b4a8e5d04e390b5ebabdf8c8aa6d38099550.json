I felt a bit sorry for the people that have these views,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI feel it is not a reflection of the views of the whole country and I feel that the appropriate steps were taken.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t affect my feeling but I was aware that we had to follow the right protocols, and not think it does not affect me so I won\u2019t report it.\n\nTyrone Mings applauds England\u00b4s fans at full-time (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cI have a duty to people that don\u2019t have a voice or that perhaps are abused and it does hurt or get to them. I don\u2019t know why it does not affect me, it just doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhile step two of UEFA\u2019s protocol was not initiated, Mings was satisfied with the process and pleased with how the players stuck together.\n\nWhen asked if he felt the protocols had worked, he said: \u201cThey did, yes.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything in the second half. I can\u2019t speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself. So I think fans were removed and if that was the case then I think the protocol has definitely worked.\n\n\u201cWe were here to play football, so we didn\u2019t want to really be having these conversations but it was important we made a collective decision.\n\n\u201cWe represent a lot of people and we have to not just make a stance for ourselves, but we have to make it clear these things won\u2019t be accepted. So it was important to consult everyone at half-time and everybody made the decision, and we played on the whole game.\u201d\n\nHaving found out he was in line to make his debut, Mings flew out some of his family at short notice to cheer him on \u2013 a decision he does not regret despite the events of the night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m immensely proud, it is a dream come true for sure,\u201d he said of his debut.\n\n\u201cIt is the pinnacle of English football, everybody dreams of representing their country, everybody knows my journey. I was extremely proud and had my friends and family in the crowd, so I don\u2019t think they will let it overshadow this.\n\n\u201cI was absolutely happy they were here tonight and it will be a memory we will talk about for a long, long time \u2013 a good memory.\u201d", "description": "Mings\u00b4 debut was overshadowed by racial abuse from some of the Bulgaria fans.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715356-1571094526-296_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
