There the government presented its own visions for future auto business promising to establish infrastructure by 2024 to support the autonomous driving and allow self-driving cars on major streets by 2027. It also vowed to boost Korea's global market share of electric and hydrogen vehicles to 10 percent by 2030. But it is not the government but businesses that have to make plans for and investments into future business engines. The government should just concentrate on helping corporate investments bear fruit. Yet the Moon administration has been anything but supportive of big businesses and now simply want to bask in their accomplishments. The Moon administration has announced so many \"visions\" that most people lost track of them long ago, but concrete support plans have been thin of the ground.\n\nKorea lags far behind the U.S., Japan and China in the race to develop future cars, because the government failed to do its job. Korean automakers still face a maze of red tape. Outdated traffic laws devised decades ago prohibit self-driving and platooning driving tests. One start-up at Seoul National University that developed the world's leading self-driving model for parcel-delivery services packed up and headed to the U.S. Without any concrete action, the visions the government has come up for future cars are nothing more than a bluff.\n\nThe U.S. government overhauled related laws and made it legal to conduct a wide range of tests of self-driving technologies and came up with regulations that recognize not only humans but artificial-intelligence systems as \"drivers.\" China is pursuing a project developing a new city populated by 2 million people whose only means of transportation will be self-driving vehicles, while Japan drastically eased regulations to set up 100 hydrogen-filling stations. In Seoul, by contrast, there are a grand total of three hydrogen-filling stations due to red tape.\n\nMoon did little to find a solution when Samsung had problem building a high-voltage tower for its chip plant in Pyeongtaek due to local residents' protests, yet had the nerve to show up at a recent company event announcing massive investment plans of W133 trillion in system semiconductors and W13 trillion in next-generation displays, seeking to bask in borrowed glory (US$1=W1,186). A Cheong Wa Dae secretary said, \"President Moon makes about five on-site visits a month on average to businesses.\" So does North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but the president's job here is not to put on shows. It is to work his fingers to the bone to break down obstacles to corporate investment and create suitable conditions. In reality the government is doing absolutely nothing to help corporations pursue future businesses like AI, big data, autonomous vehicles and biotechnology. In the case of ride-sharing apps it has been actively obstructive. With the scandal over Justice Minister Cho Kuk just a day or two behind it, this is a time for the government to keep very quiet and concentrate on doing its job.\n\n", "description": "Moon Should Eat Humble Pie and Do His Job", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
