That was down from average growth of 190,000 a month in the eight years since employment started picking up after the last recession. The August tally was propped up in part by the addition of 25,000 temporary Census Bureau workers by the U.S. government, while estimates of payrolls in July and June were revised down.\n\n\"I do think the economy is slowing,\" said Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist for investment-management firm AllianceBernstein. \"As growth slows, it's natural that firms will pull back a little bit on the pace of hiring.\"\n\nStocks rose slightly on the news. Though the bellwether report pointed to a slowing economy, it also affirmed market expectations that the Federal Reserve will reduce short-term interest rates this month. Lower interest rates tend to lift shares.\n\nThere were some bright spots in Friday's job market report. A survey of households showed the share of workers aged 25 to 54 working or seeking work increased to 82.6% in August from 82% in July, the largest monthly increase since 1960 and a signal that working-age individuals remain optimistic about their job prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, pay is holding up after slowing a bit in the spring. Average hourly earnings climbed 3.2% from August 2018, enough to keep worker earnings well above the inflation rate. The pay measure has now been above the 3% threshold for more than a year after lagging for much of the expansion.\n\n\"The important thing is that the wage increases, which had slowed, seem to be coming back,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. \"That points to the simple fact that the labor market really is tight.\"\n\nThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% in August for the third consecutive month. The jobless rate remains near a 50-year low, a sign of job security and plentiful work opportunities for millions of individuals. Still, its downward trajectory appears to have lost some momentum. At its August level, the jobless rate was little changed from 3.8% a year earlier. Between 2010 and 2018, by contrast, it fell on average 0.6 percentage point a year.\n\nInvestors have been shaken in recent months by signs the global economy is slowing. On Friday China's central bank released 900 billion yuan ($126 billion) to banks to spur the economy, and the Bank of Russia cut its key interest rate for the third time this year to the same end.\n\nEarlier this week the Institute for Supply Management reported its closely watched gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August. The report -- coming after data pointing to contracting factory activity in the U.K., Germany, Japan and South Korea -- fueled fears that a manufacturing slowdown elsewhere in the world had reached the U.S.\n\nMany business executives have said in conference calls with investors in recent weeks that uncertainty about trade between the U.S. and China is clouding their outlook.\n\nSummit Brewing, a St. Paul, Minn.-based brewery with 80 employees, is pulling back on hiring to contain cost pressures cropping up due to global trade fights. It has left five positions unfilled this year in brewing, packaging and sales due to a recent 20% price increase for aluminum cans tied to tariffs.\n\nMark Stutrud, Summit Brewing's president, said Summit has also deferred capital spending on some projects, including adding fermentation tanks to a research facility.\n\nDespite a slowdown in business also associated with increased competition, Mr. Stutrud has boosted employee pay an average 3.5% over the past year to retain workers.\n\n\"We have to be very competitive where it comes to wages and benefits,\" Mr. Stutrud said. \"The economy is healthy.\"\n\nForecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projects economic output in the third quarter will grow at an annual rate of 2%, matching the 2% pace in the second quarter while down from 2.9% in 2018.\n\nPresident Trump has argued that the Federal Reserve is holding back the economy with higher-than-necessary interest rates.\n\nSigns of a global slowdown have sent yields on U.S. long-term bonds tumbling, in anticipation of low inflation and Fed rate cuts to stimulate economic activity.\n\nIn futures markets, investors are pricing in a quarter-percentage-point interest-rate cut by the Fed at its policy meeting Sept. 17-18. Rate cuts are meant to spur growth by reducing the cost of borrowing, thus making it cheaper for businesses to invest and for consumers to purchase big-ticket items like homes and cars.\n\n\"The Fed should lower rates,\" Mr. Trump said in a tweet Friday morning. \"They were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut.\"\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking in Zurich, Switzerland, said lower rates have already helped to support the economy. He did little to push back against expectations for another rate move this month. \"Our labor market is in quite a strong position,\" he said, playing down fears of recession.\n\nManufacturers added 3,000 employees to their payrolls in August, another sign of slowdown. So far this year, manufacturing payrolls have grown 27,000, compared with growth over the same period in 2018 of 154,000 and in 2017 of 91,000. Manufacturing overtime dipped to 3.2 hours a week, the lowest level since April 2017.\n\nPennsylvania-based Norcen Industries, Inc. distributes plastics to manufacturers and runs a precision machine shop for metal parts. Typically workers at the 25-person company log five to 10 hours of overtime a week during the busy summer season. But business has slowed and now there is just enough work to keep them occupied for a regular 40-hour work week, said Josh Williams, Norcen's president.\n\nCustomers are \"holding off on ordering stuff,\" Mr. Williams said, citing trade-related cost increases. \"They're all worried about pricing.\"\n\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 06, 2019 18:01 ET (22:01 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
