Photo: Paramount Pictures\n\nIn Terminator: Dark Fate, the latest souped-up Terminator gets shotgunned and comes back, pulverized and comes back, incinerated and comes back, and after more than an hour of his coming back, I thought of Jay Leno\u2019s old Doritos commercials: \u201cCrunch all you want. We\u2019ll make more.\u201d Yep, you can crunch these Terminators all you want, and if they can\u2019t reconstitute themselves (after, say, being smushed in a handy hydraulic press or dissolved in a handy pit of molten steel), the machines in the future will make more \u2014 and send them yet again to the past to kill someone or someone\u2019s mother, generating more chases, explosions, disintegrations, and reintegrations. These are Doritos movies, indeed: a lot of crunching, a lot of empty calories.\n\nDark Fate should be considered the sixth Terminator film, but the studios have their own kind of time machine, so it\u2019s retroactively the third. That is to say, remember movies 3, 4, and 5? Forget them. Just as in the latest Halloween, in which Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019s Laurie Strode isn\u2019t Michael\u2019s little sister anymore, Sarah Connor and her son, John, didn\u2019t get away clean. Seems there was another T101 (the Teutonic, lumpy-jawed original) in the mix who kept himself out of T2\u2019s T101 vs. T2 battle \u2014 possibly he was sightseeing \u2014 and bided his time until Sarah and John lowered their guard. The prologue of Terminator: Dark Fate depicts the tragic upshot. Yes, Sarah and John did prevent the exterminating Skynet from being born, but another human-hating machine came along by the name of Legion. (Couldn\u2019t the filmmakers have come up with a different kind of villain? They\u2019re as unimaginative as the Knights Who Say \u201cNi\u201d: \u201cWe want \u2014 another shrubbery!\u201d)\n\nWhat really happened, of course, is that with T2 James Cameron thought he\u2019d wrapped up the saga in a neat bow but didn\u2019t count on his ex (one of his exes, actually, the producer Gayle Ann Hurd) holding on to the rights and, with Hollywood\u2019s enthusiastic collaboration, messing up his optimistic ending with an apocalyptic third film. Screw you, Jim: Skynet won anyway. But box-office returns diminished with each non-Cameron sequel, so the post-T2 slate has been wiped clean and the super-director prevailed upon to return (as producer) along with the original Sarah Connor, Linda Hamilton \u2014 another Cameron ex. (Asked if she thought her then-husband would change after winning an Oscar for Titanic, Hamilton replied that he\u2019d still be an asshole. By then, he\u2019d apparently taken up with Suzy Amis from Titanic.)\n\nSo Hamilton is here, badassed, unsmiling, with a whiskey-and-cigarettes croak that recalls the late Carrie Fisher although she\u2019s nowhere near as fun, plus another feminist warrior, Grace (Mackenzie Davis), who arrives in Mexico City buck naked from the future in a crackle of electricity. Grace has come back \u2014 like so many before her \u2014 to protect Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), whom the machines want dead on account of \u2026 no spoilers, but trust me, they hate her. The would-be assassin is the Rev 9 (Gabriel Luna), who reverts when bazookaed to a tarlike ooze and can split in two for extra oomph. (A black skeleton climbs out of him \u2014 very Day of the Dead.) Grace, whose precise nature I also won\u2019t reveal, is plainly overmatched by this Terminator (\u201cYou don\u2019t fight it, you run from it\u201d), but with help from Sarah, a pissed-off Dani, and someone with a heavy Austrian accent, she has a shot at luring the indefatigable shape-shifter to Dark Fate\u2019s equivalent of a hydraulic press or molten pit. There are nice touches. A sequence at the Mexico-Texas border suggests a dystopian future that\u2019s already here, and no one will fail to register that humanity\u2019s savior is a woman and a Mexican man. Cameron\u2019s audaciously hopeful ethos returns with a vengeance: \u201cFuck fate. What matters are the choices we make now.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more, but it\u2019s hard to accept the idea that the future isn\u2019t written from a movie in which every plot twist is telegraphed so far in advance. (The Hollywood word for \u201cfate\u201d is formula.) The director, Tim Miller, has a relatively light touch in the dialogue scenes that break up the Terminator\u2019s attacks (though there\u2019s nothing he can do with the leaden speeches), but the staging isn\u2019t as witty as you\u2019d expect from the onetime animator who made Deadpool. Cameron\u2019s T2 was equally repetitive, but the CGI was like nothing we\u2019d ever seen, and even today it elicits awe: What is this silver blob that can take the shape of whatever it wants, including lethal weapons? The technology of Terminator: Dark Fate is exponentially more advanced, but the pacing is so unvaried that even the miracles make you say \u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nCameron \u2014 who gets the first story credit, followed by four more writers \u2014 does one thing better than anybody: cornball self-sacrifice. Leave me, save yourself, I die for all mankind, etc. Great war-movie stuff, and the actors play it well. Davis has been poised for stardom for a while (she\u2019s startling in Always Shine and a hoot in Izzy Gets the Fuck Across Town), and while the role doesn\u2019t use her gift for irony, she manages to suggest the sad separateness of a hybrid being. (She looks like Mary Stuart Masterson stretched out.) The Colombian-born Reyes evokes Dani\u2019s innocence without seeming insipid, and her budding militancy without forsaking vulnerability. The new Terminator, Gabriel Luna, looks superciliously fit, with a tiny smile that suggests arousal when he recovers his human form. Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 who I feared would never escape the humiliation of Terminator: Genysis, in which his paunchy Terminator was referred to as \u201cPops\u201d \u2014 is about as expressive as it\u2019s possible for him to be. He has the same haggard countenance as in the low-key, post-zombie-apocalypse drama Maggie and the faraway, what-the-hell-happened-to-me gaze of a onetime Mr. Universe losing the war (as we all must) to age and gravity. The loss of arrogance becomes him.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate has gotten much better reviews than it deserves, but I understand why people want to embrace it. The stars of the first big wave of sci-fi action blockbusters \u2014 Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Harrison Ford and his fellow Star Wars icons \u2014 are at an age when they can collect Social Security, and their passing of the torch (especially to young women) honors the past while pointing toward a more just, equal society. But the world it suggests to me is the one of \u201cfranchises\u201d and \u201ctentpoles,\u201d in which bigger and faster machines create the same rudimentary junk. Telling you to crunch all you want is how the studios get you lazy, fat, and addicted.", "description": "In Terminator: Dark Fate, the latest souped-up Terminator gets shotgunned and comes back, pulverized and comes back, and incinerated and comes back.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-terminator-dark-fate.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
