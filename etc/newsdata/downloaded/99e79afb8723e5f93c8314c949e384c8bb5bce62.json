It faces competition from new team events, including the Laver Cup co-owned by Roger Federer and played in September since 2017, and the ATP Cup which launches in Australia in January.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "David Haggerty has been re-elected as president of the International Tennis Federation.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
