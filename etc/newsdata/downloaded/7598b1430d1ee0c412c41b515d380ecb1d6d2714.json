At first, many thought the split occurred so that Kylie could get back with her ex, Tyga, but the beauty mogul quickly put those rumors to rest. Now, though, it seems like someone else is being blamed for the breakup.\n\nOne Instagram, that has since been deleted, was dedicated to proving that Travis Scott was having an affair with Rojean Kar while dating Kylie. It posted multiple photos showing that Travis and Rojean were in the same location at similar times, and shared images of them wearing the same tee shirts on multiple occasions.\n\nFed up with the rumors that she had something to do with the split, Rojean took to her private Instagram to clear her name.\n\n\"None of these rumors are true, it's just the internet creating a false narrative,\" she wrote on her stories. \"Please stop spreading lies & leave him, her & I alone because it's affecting real lives. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Yungsweetro\" posted something about rumors between Travis Scott and her. She said everything is fake.
