His shot from the edge of the box was tipped way by Pierluigi Gollini and he then skied an effort from Phil Foden's cutback. To make matters worse, Atalanta then took a surprise lead from the penalty spot after 28 minutes.\n\nNo matter. Aguero hasn't scored 241 goals for City by giving up, and his equaliser after 34 minutes was a predatory marksman at the top of his game,\n\nManchester City striker had gone three games without a goal before scoring against Atalanta\n\nRaheem Sterling finished a flowing City move with a dink into the penalty area and Aguero overtook his marker Berat Djimisti to prod the ball home on the volley from six yards.\n\nFour minutes later, Aguero and City had scored again to mark the striker's 100th appearance in European club competition. Sterling was felled in the box by Andrea Masiello and though Aguero's penalty record isn't always perfect, this spot-kick was, low to Golllini's right.\n\nHe probably deserved a hat-trick but Gollini blocked his shot in the second half and Sterling beat him to the treble by ramming in the rebound later in the same attack as City went on to record a handsome 5-1 victory.\n\nAguero sportingly put his arm around Sterling to 'congratulate' him. City's No 10 was unable to claim the match ball but Gabriel Jesus will realise who is still the main man at the Etihad.", "description": "Even the best occasionally need a shove in the right direction and it was surely no coincidence that Aguero's return to form followed some positive headlines for his strike rival Jesus.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20055512-0-image-a-6_1571778127121.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
