(AP) - Auburn coach Bruce Pearl and LSU\u2019s Will Wade are both hoping to build on big seasons while dealing with a major potential challenge for their respective programs off the court.\n\nBoth programs were at the center of a federal corruption investigation into college basketball. Pearl and Wade are still coaching and trying to keep those winning ways going on the court. They spoke with optimism about the state of their teams Wednesday at Southeastern Conference media day, but there is still uncertainty surround the teams.\n\nLSU is coming off an SEC regular-season title while Auburn made its first run to the Final Four.\n\nWhat the coaches can\u2019t control is what the NCAA does, and what repercussions might come in the aftermath, if any.\n\nAuburn expects to receive a notice of allegations from the NCAA stemming from a bribery scheme involving former assistant coach Chuck Person, who has been sentenced in federal court for his actions. Pearl wasn\u2019t accused of any wrongdoing by federal investigators but does have a past run-in with the NCAA from his Tennessee days.\n\nLSU suspended Wade through the postseason after he declined to meet with then-athletic director Joe Alleva about a leaked FBI wiretap transcript that raised questions about whether the coach committed recruiting violations.\n\nLSU reinstated Wade in April , two days after the coach met with school and NCAA officials. Asked if he ever doubted he\u2019d be back this season, he said: \u201cI felt good about things.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously it was a difficult time, but I was always in communication with LSU,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI was always in communication with our folks, and I felt like once we could get to the table with everybody that things would work out and we\u2019d be here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly excited to be here. I\u2019m excited to be back and excited to coach LSU and looking forward to continuing to do that for a long time.\u201d\n\nAlleva said he had little choice except to reinstate Wade because there was no evidence showing the coach violated NCAA rules.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what the NCAA is going to do at this point,\u201d Wade said, \u201cbut we\u2019re very, very comfortable and confident with how we\u2019ve run our program.\u201d\n\nHe now has contract clauses making it easier for LSU to fire him if he commits a Level I or Level II NCAA violation, or if the NCAA infractions committee gives LSU formal notice that Wade was involved in a Level I or Level II infraction.\n\nKansas and North Carolina State have each already received a notice of allegations stemming from the federal probe.\n\nPearl, meanwhile, has a checkered past with the NCAA. He came to Auburn in the final months of a three-year show cause for violations - and lies about them - that led to his firing at Tennessee.\n\nAuburn has said it expects to receive a notice of allegations, saying in a victim impact statement in federal court that the school was a \u201cvictim\u201d of Person\u2019s bribery scheme. Auburn found that current players Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy or their families received money from Person.\n\nBoth players sat out the 2017-18 season and the NCAA\u2019s punishment of Purifoy extended into last season as well.\n\n\u201cI would say that adversity reveals character way more than it builds it, so I\u2019d like to think the last couple years our character has been revealed, because these have been some challenging times,\u201d said Pearl, who received a new five-year, $20 million contract in April. \u201cSo we\u2019ve done a lot of things the right way in that situation, and we\u2019re not done yet, but I\u2019m confident in the process.\u201d\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t worried about its potential impact on him personally. \u201cI\u2019m very confident in the process,\u201d Pearl said.\n\nAuburn\u2019s investigation found that Purifoy\u2019s parents received some $4,500 in cash and hotel rooms from Person. Purifoy received $1,250 of that, according to Auburn.\n\nWiley, whose father is a cousin of Person, received spending money totaling some $800 from the then-Auburn assistant during his freshman year.\n\nWiley said Pearl doesn\u2019t want the team distracted by the potential NCAA issues.\n\n\u201cHe wants us to focus on the season,\u201d the senior center said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not pertaining to us, we have no reason to even talk about it. So we\u2019re going to let that be.\u201d\n\nAdded forward Anfernee McLemore: \u201cI hear about it sometimes, but I really just try to focus on school and things. I don\u2019t know any specifics of any allegations or anything like that, but I just kind of let it go through one ear and out the other.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Auburn coach Bruce Pearl and LSU's Will Wade are both hoping to build on big seasons while dealing with a major potential challenge for their respective programs off the court.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Zenor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/sec_media_day_basketball_07436_c0-135-3238-2023_s1200x700.jpg?04ab714cd56652948ae9dee276dcbb5027a76b33", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
