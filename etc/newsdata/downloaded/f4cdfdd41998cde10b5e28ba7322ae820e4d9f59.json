Wall Street shares are up in early trade on some promising trade headlines, but it\u2019s early still.\n\nAnd then earnings season kicks off next week with some big banks. Before you know it, we\u2019re hitting the holidays and maybe some uneasy flashbacks to last year\u2019s December stock meltdown.\n\nA repeat of that rout may be unavoidable, warns our call of the day from former Goldman Sachs alumnus Raoul Pal. \u201cWe\u2019re coming into a period of illiquidity for equities,\u201d the author of the Global Macro Investor newsletter, followed by the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds, told MarketWatch in a recent interview.\n\nHe cites three reasons why a repeat of that stock selloff may be inevitable. The first is the blackout period for companies, which hits around earnings time when their share buy backs start to slow. Secondly, he notes that this year has also seen problems with the short-term borrowing market, or repo market, that the Federal Reserve has been trying to tackle. It could mean less buying from market makers \u2014 who help create liquidity for markets by bringing buyers and sellers together.\n\nPal says the third biggest issue facing stocks involves the baby boomers, Americans born between the mid 1940s and mid 1960s. They face an annual requirement to sell about 5% of their individual retirement accounts, loaded with stocks in some cases, as they reach 70.5 years old.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the gap between this year and last year is huge. It\u2019s like 50% increase in the amount of selling that has to be done,\u201d said Pal, who was among the few investors who predicted and profited amid the 2008-09 mortgage meltdown. \u201cThey have to start selling by year-end. If you take out the Christmas week and you\u2019re a financial adviser, and you want to get this done early, you will start in October.\u201d\n\nHe blames boomer selling for part of the meltdown for stocks late last year. \u201cThe marginal change of an American baby boomer thinking \u2018I\u2019ve got too much equities,\u2019 which they do have \u2014 that is catastrophic for the system, because they have way, way too much risk,\u201d says Pal, co-founder of Real Vision financial television.\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, +0.95% , S&P SPX, +0.97% and the Nasdaq COMP, +0.97% is up, having been bounced around on conflicting reports of trade progress.
