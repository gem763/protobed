Hinch said of the sellout crowd of 43,867 fans. \u201cThe fans here were incredible.\u201d\n\nThe Astros, after losing two games in Houston, scored runs in four different innings and captured a 4-1 victory as the Nationals left 12 runners on base and were 0-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Washington still leads the series 2-1 with game 4 on Saturday at 8:07 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe were aggressive out of the strike zone \u2014 uncharacteristic of what we had been doing,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cLet\u2019s go get some rest and come back tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhile the bats were mostly silent, Martinez praised the Nationals fans who painted Navy Yard red. Many stood throughout the game, waiting in vain for the Washington offense to break loose.\n\n\u201cIt was electric,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBring it again tomorrow. It was great; I love it.\u201d\n\nThe Astros were able to shut down Washington star Juan Soto on Friday. He had three hits in Game 1 but was hitless in Game 3 and struck out to end the contest.\n\n\u201cWe are pretty good, too. He was very aggressive early,\u201d Hinch said of Soto. \u201cWe just had a nice team win. We did a lot of things well tonight. Our pitching was phenomenal. It reestablishes us in this series. A win was huge for us tonight. This series is clearly not over.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals trailed 2-1 when starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez came to the plate with a runner on base and out in the fourth.\n\nMartinez thought of using a pinch-hitter but didn\u2019t. \u201cI seriously thought about it,\u201d the manager said. Sanchez struck out and then leadoff man Trea Turner made the last out of the frame.\n\n\u201cWe want to be aggressive in the strike zone,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThat is our goal. We just didn\u2019t do that tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel good,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cThose games, it\u2019s day by day. Tomorrow is another day. Everything\u2019s tied at zero. Hopefully,y we got a better opportunity to score some runs and let\u2019s see what happens tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWashington catcher Kurt Suzuki had to leave the game in the sixth inning with a right hip flexor and Martinez said he will know more about his condition Saturday.\n\nThe Nationals will start veteran lefty Patrick Corbin on Saturday while Houston will go with opener Jose Urquidy.\n\n\u201cHe will go as long as he is good,\u201d Hinch said of the reliever.\n\n\u201cThe manager told me I will have the ball tomorrow,\u201d rookie Urquidy said through an interpreter. \u201cI am trying to learn from these three games and compete tomorrow. I am living the dream. It is a big opportunity for me.\u201d\n\nHouston\u2019s Michael Brantley had two hits and drove in two. \u201cWe have a lot of respect for the Nationals. They are up 2-1. They played a competitive ballgame,\u201d Brantley said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
