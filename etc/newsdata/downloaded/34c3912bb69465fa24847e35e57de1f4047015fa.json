But, as she revealed on Mornings with Stephen Jardine, her dad had died in the previous year.\n\nThat first text was soon accompanied by more, as Emma realised this was a way she could stay connected to her dad, but her joy at discovering this new route to him ended when she eventually called the number \u2014 and somebody else answered.\n\nEmma's actions are not unusual. These days our digital presence lives on even after we've died so it's not surprising that grief-stricken friends or family members regard phone numbers or social media pages as a means of staying close to those they miss.", "description": "Using technology to stay in touch with the dead is nothing new.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07r5f7g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
