Fitch Rates Hybrid Securities by Bharti Airtel's Subsidiary Final 'BB'\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Singapore-October 20: Fitch Ratings has assigned a final rating of 'BB' to the 5.65% USD750 million deeply subordinated perpetual bonds issued by Network i2i Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bharti Airtel (NS: ) Limited (Bharti, BBB-/Stable). The issuance is fully guaranteed by Bharti and constitutes a direct, unsecured and subordinated obligation of Bharti. The final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received and is in line with the expected rating assigned on 30 September 2019. The proposed securities qualify for 50% equity credit, under Fitch's analysis. The group plans to use the proceeds for debt repayment, investment in subsidiaries and general corporate purposes. The rating on the securities is two notches below Bharti's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating. This reflects the proposed notes' deeply subordinated nature, ranking junior to all existing and future debt obligations and senior only to Bharti's share capital. This approach is in accordance with Fitch's Corporate Hybrids Treatment and Notching Criteria. We assess that the securities qualify for 50% equity credit as they meet Fitch's criteria with regard to deep subordination, effective maturity in excess of five years, full discretion to indefinitely defer interest coupon payments, limited events of default and the absence of material covenants and look-back provisions. Equity credit is limited to 50% due to the cumulative interest coupon, a feature that we regard as more debt-like in nature. Fitch will treat the coupon payments as 100% interest in its financial analysis of Bharti, despite the 50% equity treatment of the principal amount. Bharti has a call option to redeem the notes on any date from the first call date to the first reset date (which will be over five years after the issue date) and at any interest payment date thereafter. There is coupon step-up of 25bp five years after the first reset date and an additional step-up of 75bp 20 years after the first reset date. The first call date and coupon step-up date are not treated as effective maturity dates under Fitch's criteria due to the cumulative amount of the step-ups being lower or equal to 1%. The documentation includes non-binding, intention-based replacement language that supports our permanence assessment of the hybrid instruments. Deferrals of coupon payments are cumulative and non-compounding; coupons can be deferred even if a dividend has been paid or shares have been bought back. Restrictions apply on dividends and distributions to junior and parity securities or buy-backs of junior and parity securities of Bharti, if the issuer defers an outstanding hybrid coupon. We expect 50% equity credit for the securities until 2040, five years before the effective maturity date in 2045, which is when the replacement language expires. Equity credit drops to zero after 2040. The perpetual securities benefit Bharti's credit profile, though not materially. The equity credit will lower Bharti's FFO adjusted net leverage by around 0.1x-0.2x. Key Rating Drivers Improving Rating Headroom: We forecast FFO adjusted net leverage to improve to 2.0x-2.2x in the financial year ending March 2020 (FY20) (FY19: 2.6x), excluding USD6.1 billion in deferred spectrum costs, after Bharti raised USD3.5 billion from a rights issue in June 2019 and used the proceeds to repay debt. We expect leverage to remain under the 2.5x threshold above which Fitch would consider negative rating action. Furthermore, we expect Bharti to sell a stake in the combined Indus Tower and Bharti Infratel (NS: ) in the next 12-18 months; the merger is awaiting regulatory approval. Bharti also raised USD1.45 billion through a private placement of an equity stake in Airtel Africa, the holding company of 14 African operations, in 2HFY19, which was used to repay USD995 million of the 2023 notes. It raised another USD680 million through an IPO of Airtel Africa in June-July 2019. The company intends to use such proceeds to repay debt. However, leverage may climb to 2.4x-2.5x in FY21 if it were to make a large upfront payment for 5G spectrum assets. Diversified Revenue Stream: Bharti's resilient cash generation is underpinned by a diversified EBITDA stream, with its Indian mobile and non-mobile and African operations each accounting for about a third of EBITDA in FY19. Its established market positions in India and Africa, solid spectrum portfolio and integrated operations are likely to help it withstand competition in the Indian mobile segment. The EBITDA contributions from its African and Indian non-mobile businesses increased to 31% and 34%, respectively, in FY19, from 22% and 28% in FY18. Mid-Single-Digit Percentage Growth: We forecast Bharti's FY20 revenue and EBITDA to rise by mid-single-digit percentages, driven by better average revenue per user (ARPU) in the Indian mobile segment and steady growth in the African and business-to-business (enterprise) segments. Indian mobile EBITDA is likely to increase by 15%-20% on strong data-usage growth and higher blended ARPU, as competition eases and incumbents focus on profitability. Bharti's 1QFY20 consolidated revenue rose by 5% yoy, while EBITDA increased by 2%, after deducting operating lease expenses to remove the effect of IndAS 116 so that the figure is comparable with previous quarters. The improvements were driven by continued growth in Africa, where revenue and EBITDA increased by 7% and 13%, respectively, on subscriber growth of 9% and stable ARPU. Its mobile EBITDA in India rose by 7% qoq to INR25 billion in 1QFY20 after improving by 33% in 4QFY19, driven by ARPU growth of 5% to INR129 as 4G subscribers increased by 10% to 95 million and average data consumption rose by 8% to 11.9GB per month per user. Stable Outlook on Indian Mobile: We expect Indian telcos' credit profiles to improve following a recovery in industry tariffs and incumbents' strategies to partially repay debt through equity injections and non-core asset sales. Blended average ARPU should rise by 5%-10% in FY20, underpinned by the incumbents' introduction of a minimum mobile tariff of INR35 (USD0.50) a month and growing data use as affordable smartphones proliferate in the industry. Strengthening African Operation: We forecast African FY20 revenue and EBITDA to grow by a high-single-digit percentage, on a constant currency basis, driven by steady growth in subscribers and mobile-money services, against management's forecast of double-digit percentage growth. However, there is likely to be a small dilution in blended ARPU in the African markets due to competition. We expect mobile money services to account for over 10% of revenue from the African operation in FY20, from the current 8%, as the services are likely to be popular in some under-banked markets. Bharti's market position has improved to be the number one or strong number two mobile operator in 11 of its 14 African markets. Bharti's stake in Airtel Africa dropped to 55%, from 68%, after the IPO. The business's net debt/EBITDA improved to 3.0x in FY19 (FY18: 6.8x) on higher EBITDA and debt repayment from pre-IPO private placement proceeds. Net debt/EBITDA improved further, to around 2.3x-2.4x, after the IPO. Negative FCF; High Capex: We forecast negative FCF in FY20 (FY19: negative INR219 billion), as cash flow from operations of INR220 billion-245 billion will be insufficient to fund large capex plans and moderate dividends of INR30 billion-40 billion. We expect FY20 capex/revenue to remain high at 34%-37%, with forecast capex of around USD4 billion, as Bharti continues to strengthen its 4G network and fibre infrastructure. However, management expects core capex, which excludes deferred spectrum payments, to have peaked and to decline significantly in FY20. Rising Fibre Importance: Fibre will become increasingly important for Indian telcos, as the weakness of fibre back-haul networks has led to a poor internet experience relative to other markets. Fibre infrastructure is also indispensable for a seamless 5G experience. We expect the government to hold a 5G spectrum auction in the next 18-24 months. However, we believe there will be limited participation from telcos given high reserve prices and limited appeal due to a lack of content and applications that cannot be addressed by 4G data speeds Derivation Summary Bharti's IDR is comparable with the rating on the Philippines' Globe Telecom, Inc. (BBB-/Stable). Bharti has a more diversified business profile and larger scale, which offset weakness at its Indian mobile business segment. Our FY20 forecast for Bharti's FFO adjusted net leverage of 2.0x-2.2x is better than Globe's 3.0x. Globe is the wireless market-leader in the Philippines, which has a duopoly telecommunications industry, and has strong execution capabilities. Fitch may consider negative rating action if Bharti's leverage rises above 2.5x, a lower level than the 3.5x for Globe, because of intense competition in India. MTN Group Limited (BB+/Negative) is rated lower than Bharti because of the South African company's weaker financial profile and deteriorating business profile following competitive pressure, poor economic conditions, particularly in South Africa, and a fine in its key market of Nigeria. The Negative Outlook reflects continuing regulatory pressure in the Nigerian market as well as the change in our Outlook on the South African sovereign's (BB+/Negative) rating. Our 2019 forecast for MTN's FFO adjusted net leverage is higher than Bharti's at 2.7x, which could breach the negative rating sensitivity of 3.0x if it were to pay the USD2 billion fine in Nigeria. Bharti's business risk profile is comparable with that of Thailand's third-largest telco by revenue - Total Access Communication Public Company Limited's (DTAC, BBB/Stable, Standalone Credit Profile: bbb-). DTAC faces difficulty in gaining market share and stabilising earnings in the medium-term due to intense price competition and weak network coverage. Fitch forecasts DTAC to post FFO adjusted net leverage of around 2.0x-2.5x in 2019, similar to Bharti's Key Assumptions Fitch's Key Assumptions within Our Rating Case for the Issuer - Revenue to increase by mid-single-digit percentage in FY20, driven by stable Indian mobile tariffs and growth in the African, homes and enterprise business segments. - Indian mobile segment's ARPU to improve by 5%-10%. - Operating EBITDAR margin to improve to 32%-33% (FY19: 31%) and competition does not intensify in the Indian mobile segment. - FY20 capex/revenue of 34%-37% to invest to strengthen its 4G networks (FY19: 40%). Capex includes spectrum payments of INR57 billion in FY20. - 5G spectrum auction in next 12-18 months and for Bharti to make USD1 billion in upfront payments in FY21. - Bharti's African subscribers to increase by around 5% and ARPU to decline by around 2% in FY20. However, management expects ARPU to remain stable. - Effective interest rate of 5.5%-6.0%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Fitch does not envisage an upgrade to Bharti's ratings in the medium-term in light of its business profile and investment needs. Bharti's ratings are not constrained by India's Country Ceiling of 'BBB-', so an upgrade in the Country Ceiling will not necessarily lead to an upgrade of Bharti's ratings. Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Prolonged intense competition or MA activity, resulting in FFO adjusted net leverage remaining at above 2.5x for a sustained period. - A downgrade of India's 'BBB-' Country Ceiling Liquidity and Debt Structure Adequate Liquidity: Bharti's cash and equivalents of INR118 billion (including proportionate cash of Infratel) and the USD680 million received from the IPO of Airtel Africa were sufficient to repay short-term debt of INR155 billion at end-June 2019. We expect the company to tap local banks or capital markets to refinance its maturing debt. The company has solid access to Indian banks and capital markets, as evident from its issuance of USD7.3 billion of unsecured bonds over the previous six years in US dollars, euros and Swiss francs. Summary of Financial Adjustments We have excluded USD6.1 billion of deferred spectrum costs from debt, as we treat such costs as capital commitments. We include annual spectrum payments in our capex forecast.
