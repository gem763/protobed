Remy Cointreau (RCO.FR) shares jumped 6% and Pernod Ricard (RI.FR) rose 3.6%, as cognac, champagne and liqueurs from France were excluded from the tariff list. Diageo (DGE.LN) and Campari (CPR.MI) shares also rose.\n\nAirbus (AIR.FR) was another gainer, rising 4%, as parts made by one of its plants in Alabama will not be subject to new sanctions.\n\nH&M (HM-B.SK) shares jumped 7% as the retail chain reported a stronger-than-forecast profit.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 05:13 ET (09:13 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
