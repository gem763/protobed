REUTERS/David Gray\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX) staff inappropriately gave personal financial advice when marketing pension funds, an Australian court said, overturning an earlier ruling in a rare win for regulators under pressure to crack down on misconduct in the finance sector.\n\nBy \u201cclosing\u201d sales and getting customers to transfer pension money in the same phonecall, \u201cthere was an implied recommendation ... that the customer should accept the service\u201d, the three judges wrote in a ruling published on Monday.\n\nThe phonecalls carried \u201can implied statement of opinion that this step would meet and fulfill the concerns and objectives the customer had enunciated. This was personal advice.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Court appeal tribunal dismissed an earlier court ruling that Westpac\u2019s advice was only \u201cgeneral\u201d and therefore allowed.\n\nThe decision is a boost for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) which along with other regulators has struggled to land a major court win against banks.\n\nA year-long public inquiry in February gave a scathing assessment of the culture at the country\u2019s financial giants, also criticizing regulators which it said had allowed the sector to reward overly aggressive, and sometimes deceptive, sales methods.\n\nASIC said the ruling \u201cprovides clarity and certainty concerning the difference between general and personal advice for consumers and financial services providers\u201d.\n\nA representative for Westpac was not immediately available for comment.", "description": "Westpac Banking Corp staff inappropriately gave personal financial advice when marketing pension funds, an Australian court said, overturning an earlier ruling in a rare win for regulators under pressure to crack down on misconduct in the finance sector.", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445714826&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R088", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
