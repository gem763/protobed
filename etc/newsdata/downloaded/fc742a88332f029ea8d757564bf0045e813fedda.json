But the other side of that equation, in Segalla\u2019s view, is increasing the lifetime value of the users acquired.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, scaling a game boils down to two simple things, [cost per install] and LTV,\u201d he said. \u201cStrong developers are working to improve the LTV of their players, but there\u2019s a lot of low-hanging fruit that with the right toolset you can use to improve the lifetime values. That\u2019s what Gondola is about \u2026 We\u2019ve been following for years, and we said, \u2018Let\u2019s bring this in-house.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGondola currently offers four modules: Target Optimization (choosing the best offer for a player), Rewarded Video Ad Optimization (choosing the right amount of virtual currency to reward a player for watching a video ad), Store Optimization (choosing the right store items to show a player) and Currency Optimization (choosing the best virtual currency amounts for offers and promotions).\n\nThe financial terms of the acquisition \u2014 Tilting Point\u2019s first \u2014 were not disclosed.
