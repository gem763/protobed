So, no rhetoric and politically and racially charged assumptions and accusations.\n\nIn business, a negotiation team receives a mandate to negotiate and then has to return to its managers (the public in this case) to get confirmation of the original decision. The Independent has rightly campaigned for this and I travelled to London in March to participate in the march as I feel strongly and have vested interests through marriage. The UK is about to enter a period of self-harm and it make me sad.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

There is no democratic way to remain in the European Union at this point in our history; there is no democratic way to reverse the result of the referendum.\n\nThe basis of government in this country is ultimately the majority view of the people. They chose one word by a majority.\n\nYour policy to completely ignore that word, as though it had never existed, is an utter disgrace; to think members of our parliament are conspiring to deny, dishonour, disrespect the majority vote of the people is quite beyond the pale.\n\nI realise you\u2019re not \u2013 which makes it all the more scandalous \u2013 but you really should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves. My father did not serve his country, nor did my uncle die for his country, for this.\n\nNeil Coppendale\u200b\n\nShoreham-by-Sea\n\nParents have the right to try\n\nMary Dejevsky\u2019s article about Tafida Raqeeb was spot on: parents should have the right to make decisions about treatment for their children. If they are denied this right, it could affect them for the rest of their lives. They have to feel they have done everything possible for their child, even if the outcome is not what they would want.\n\nThe elder of my two sons was born with profound disabilities. At the age of 24 he was allowed to dehydrate whilst in respite care, leading to renal failure. After ten days, the very sympathetic consultant told us that this could not be reversed, and advised us that it would be the fairest thing for him if the treatment was discontinued. He died 36 hours later. The night before he died I had a \u201cwobble\u201d. A friend visited him in hospital and remarked how well he looked, and this led me to have a \u201cwhat if\u201d moment. The hospital staff were very understanding and called the consultant, who assured me this was not possible. We accepted this, but if I hadn\u2019t felt I had done everything possible for my son, I might have wondered if the outcome could have been different.\n\nDiane Graham\n\nWatford\n\nA taxing issue\n\nTwo letters to your publication propound the myth that the government has a fixed amount of money to spend into the economy. Tim Baines and Rhiannon Cutler warn that the withdrawal of the unjustified subsidy to private education will reduce the tax take. Jennifer Walley believes that prolonging healthy lives will put a burden on future generations.\n\nIt is time the public were told the truth: that taxes do not fund public expenditure. The government, as monopoly issuer of our currency, can buy anything for sale in sterling, including idle labour. It merely credits bank accounts. Its only constraint is the real resources available: land, labour and capital goods.\n\nWe had the same real resources before and after the great financial crash!\n\nTaxes have to be paid in sterling which extinguishes some of that new money. There is no pot of tax receipts. Nor is there any need for the government to borrow in its own currency by selling bonds. If the government tries to save by taxing more than it spends it merely shifts debt to the private sector and shrinks the economy.\n\nThe monetarist snakeoil salesmen will call public expenditure \u201cprinting money\u201d and scaremonger about Zimbabwe-style hyperinflation \u2013 whilst the UK, EU, US and Japan, mostly with huge and growing debt, try to prevent deflation by reducing interest rates. Please tell them to go away.\n\nCarol Wilcox\n\nChristchurch", "description": "I refer to the article about\u00a0David Cameron not being to blame for the Brexit crisis\u00a0and the division it has caused.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/21/AFP-1K978P.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
