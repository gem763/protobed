(Louis-Dreyfus has three more awards for producing the show.)\n\n\"Fleabag\" also won the Emmy for directing, while Emmy voters again smiled on the period dramedy \"Mrs. Maisel,\" which mounted a near-sweep of those awards last year (with \"Veep,\" notably, sitting out the race). Alex Borstein claimed her second consecutive supporting actress win for the Amazon dramedy, while Tony Shalhoub received his fourth Emmy overall.\n\nBill Hader was a repeat winner as lead actor for HBO's \"Barry,\" breaking up what was otherwise an Amazon block party.\n\nRepeat winners, in fact, dominated the early part of the show, with \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" running off with the prize for best competition program. Host RuPaul injected the first note of politics into the evening, urging viewers to go register and vote.\n\nRead More", "description": "Emmys deliver to Amazon comedies, while 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' and 'Fleabag' notch early victories", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190922175047-phoebe-waller-bridge-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
