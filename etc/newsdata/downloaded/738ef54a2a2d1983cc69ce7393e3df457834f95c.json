The prevalent view is that Australia needs to do nothing to restore more normal and constructive relations with China.\n\nThe China Threat\n\nAustralia is said to be in nothing less than a long-term struggle with China to define the future terms of the relationship. Businesspeople who urge the government to do more to improve relations are casually dismissed as self-serving, as if concern about the economic impact of a dysfunctional relationship were illegitimate. Academics are simply na\u00efve, or worse.\n\nIn this view, China is seen as the cause of protracted difficulties in the relationship through its aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea, bullying of other states \u2013 as it is doing to Australia and other neighbours with which it has disagreements \u2013 purported cyber-attacks by state-sponsored actors, technology theft, and political interference in domestic politics and on university campuses.\n\nThese are the external and internal elements of the China Threat which reinforce each other to create a powerful narrative. The domestic dimension feeds the narrative that China must be pushed back in foreign policy and bad behaviour by China internationally is used to support the need for greater vigilance domestically.\n\nThe narrative has been used to justify one of Australia\u2019s more spectacular own goals in foreign policy when it introduced a blanket ban on the Chinese telecoms company Huawei participating in any aspect of building the 5G network, something most others in the Five Eyes have not done. Germany, whose Chancellor\u2019s personal phone was hacked by the US, has said that Huawei is welcome to participate.\n\nIt may or may not be technically feasible to protect the sensitive elements of the network but there was no need for Australia alone to make Beijing lose face, set off a populist nationalist reaction, and deny itself potential commercial benefits.\n\nThe China Threat narrative in Australia has pushed policy to the fringes internationally. At the Commonwealth level, Australia views Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative as an attempt to impose a Sino-centric order on the world. Much of the rest of the world is more open to its potential benefits, while of course being alert to its potential risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome 152 countries, including 18 in Europe, have signed relevant memoranda of understanding to participate in the BRI. International bodies, including United Nations agencies, also participate. BRI is a loose association established by non-binding memoranda of understanding. They impose no binding obligations on signatories or involve surrendering any sovereignty. Opposition to BRI in Australia is principally ideological.\n\nTo advance Australia\u2019s interests internationally requires either China\u2019s support or acquiescence.\n\nThe Andrews government in Victoria should be congratulated on having the clear-eyed vision to recognise that BRI poses no threat to Australia\u2019s national interest and offers potential benefits to Victoria. The more Canberra\u2019s position is at odds with reality, the more likely it will be that other state governments will follow Victoria\u2019s lead.\n\nWith bilateral trade at a record level, it may seem that the current state of bilateral relations holds no consequences for Australia. But the relationship with China is not just about trade, although that is a key national interest.\n\nTo advance Australia\u2019s interests internationally requires either China\u2019s support or acquiescence, be it climate change, energy security, disarmament, anti-piracy efforts at sea, and other asymmetrical security threats including people-smuggling.\n\nIf we wish to reflect the Australian community's concern over Hong Kong, if that should become necessary, or over human rights of the Uighurs and other ethnic minorities, at present we have nothing other than megaphone diplomacy, which is usually counterproductive. It is time for diplomats to be put back in charge of our foreign policy on China.", "description": "The big chill in ties with Beijing is a badge of honour in some quarters.
