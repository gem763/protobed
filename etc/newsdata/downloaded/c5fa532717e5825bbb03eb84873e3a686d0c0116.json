We battled but you expect that at this level in every game,\u2019 said the England captain.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s disappointing being 1-0 up at half-time, being ahead and not being able to see it through.\n\nJordan Henderson and Mohamed Salah scored the goals for Liverpool on Sunday (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018When you lose a game, it\u2019s not a step forward \u2014 it showed we\u2019ve got to work hard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s disappointing, so we\u2019ll assess it and see where we can improve. Then, hopefully, we can take it into Everton on Sunday.\n\n\u2018We could have been a bit braver. When we went 2-1 down, we started to do it better, create two or three chances towards the end but it was too late.\u2019\n\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino called for calm and unity after the defeat on Merseyside, claiming that his team deserve a lot more than they have got this campaign so far.\n\n\u2018After five and a half years it\u2019s a moment to be all together and show our support,\u2019 said Pochettino.\n\n\u2018In this season we deserve more points on the table. It\u2019s a moment to stay strong, to keep pushing.\n\n\u2018Of course in a different season this game could have finished two or three nil for us. But today for us it is a different way and we must stay calm and take the best decisions for the future.\u2019\n\nThe Champions League runners-up have a week off now, before returning to Premier League action at Everton on Sunday.\n\nMORE: Man Utd legend Roy Keane slammed over brutal Liverpool v Tottenham analysis\n\nMORE: Jurgen Klopp was \u2018satisfied\u2019 with Liverpool stars at half-time against Tottenham", "description": "Harry Kane has admitted that Tottenham 'could have been a bit braver' in their 2-1 defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday.
