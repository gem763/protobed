His message: Someone is trying to keep this all secret.\n\n\u201cWe do know that the Department of Justice has been involved in the decision to withhold that information from Congress,\u201d Schiff told reporters. \u201cWe do not know, because we cannot get an answer, about whether the White House is also involved in preventing this information from coming to Congress. We do not have the complaint. We do not know whether the press reports are accurate or inaccurate about the contents of that complaint.\u201d\n\nIt was Schiff who first disclosed the existence of the whistleblower complaint, when on Friday the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, to hand it over. He has not, and the details remained vague, as they still are today.\n\nCNN reported that the White House and the Justice Department advised Maguire to withhold the complaint.\n\nThe story has either the makings of a new bombshell involving Trump\u2019s dealings with foreign leaders or a story with so many convoluted legal angles that it\u2019s too difficult to command public attention.\n\nTrump\u2019s initial reaction is no surprise, given his public suspicions of the intelligence world and his supporters characterization of it as the \u201cdeep state.\u201d\n\nHe tweeted on Thursday, \u201cAnother Fake News story out there \u2013 It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\n\n\u201c\u2026.Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d\n\nOthers feared that the revelations of the complaint\u2019s contents could undermine the whistleblower system, \u201cwhich only works unless people keep it quiet until it is adjudicated,\u201d Mike Rogers, the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee and now a CNN analyst and host, said on the network.\n\nBut this is also just the type of story that is irresistible to media speculation, theorizing and scrutiny of just who Trump was talking to and what was said or promised, even if the president is labelling it \u201cfake news\u201d that \u201cnever ends.\u201d Was it Vladimir Putin? Was in Kim Jong Un? Or someone else altogether.\n\nTrump not only has a propensity to label news as \u201cfake,\u201d but to cast doubt on the use of unnamed sources and blast journalistic mistakes as further evidence that the media is against him. So the risks are great as news outlets scramble to report out the story and turn to national security experts to explain what is happening.\n\nNed Price, spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama and an NBC contributor, told Deadline that \u201cthere is always a temptation, and I fall victim to it as well, to read the tea leaves and play amateur analyst to figure out what is at the base of the allegation.\u201d\n\nThe real danger, he said, would be if the complaint never came to light, as was entirely possible. The fact that a whistleblower complaint was filed at all was regarded as something highly unusual if not unprecedented. And even the vague details that have been disclosed, that the complaint was deemed \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201curgent,\u201d are a signal that there is \u201csomething quite disturbing at the heart of this,\u201d Price said.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
