That is what I have chosen to do. I have had a wonderful career,\u201d Eto\u2019o told AFP during a visit to Paris.\n\nHis career spanned more than 20 years in which he won 18 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues with Barcelona and another with Inter Milan. He also won the Africa Cup of Nations twice with Cameroon as well as Olympic gold in 2000.\n\nOne prize that did get away from him, however, was the Ballon d\u2019Or. Liberia\u2019s George Weah, in 1995, remains the only African to have claimed that award, but that does not change Eto\u2019o\u2019s belief that he is the best player to have come out of the continent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to lay claim to anything, it\u2019s just a fact. Whether you accept it or not, it\u2019s a fact,\u201d he said, as frank and outspoken as ever.\n\n\u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinion. You know, as an African, you are always being judged. What is unacceptable is that the first people to do it are always the Africans. They can\u2019t take anything away from me because I am proud to be African.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at where I came from and how far I got, I tell myself that I am entitled to be proud. That doesn\u2019t mean I am big-headed, far from it. It is just that, in this world, people like puppets and I don\u2019t accept being one.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Could have won World Cup\u2019 \u2013\n\nEto\u2019o also turned out for the likes of Real Madrid and Chelsea, but for all he won in the game, it is his first major title with his country that sticks out when asked for his fondest memory.\n\n\u201cI would say my first Africa Cup of Nations (in 2000), because it was my first AFCON, an unforgettable moment, and I had come away from the 1998 World Cup in France with the hope of making history,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a starter in that magnificent team but in the end I worked my way into the side and contributed. It is a beautiful memory.\u201d\n\nEto\u2019o also went to four World Cups but never got beyond the group stage with the Indomitable Lions.\n\n\u201cI told myself that, eventually, with all the magnificent players I played alongside for Cameroon, we could have won the World Cup,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t to be. That is the only trophy I didn\u2019t manage to win but I had some unforgettable moments with that team.\u201d\n\nPart of a golden generation that featured Rigobert Song, the late Marc-Vivien Foe and Geremi, Eto\u2019o believes he has left a legacy by helping bring through the next generation. Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana is one player to have emerged from the Eto\u2019o Foundation.\n\nHe has also been asked to do work for the Confederation of African Football, but he says it is only a matter of time before he returns to football in a more hands-on role.\n\n\u2013 Coach in Europe \u2013\n\n\u201cI know my next challenge will be to win at least as much as a coach as I did as a player,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would like to coach in Europe, and then one day return to Africa and win there. I don\u2019t know how to lose.\n\n\u201cI am lucky to have made history at different clubs. I have a lot more doors open to me than others, but you need to be prepared.\n\n\u201cI want to learn, have all the qualifications, understand how things work either in my own businesses or in my future career, in order to come back in 12 or 24 months and start a new career, which I hope will be just as beautiful.\u201d\n\nBut having won the Champions League playing for both Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho, whose style is he more likely to be replicate?\n\n\u201cI am a fan of Guardiola. I love football and I think it\u2019s important to win in style.\n\n\u201cFootball is like going to the theatre: it is great to go to the stadium and see a spectacle. When you watch Guardiola\u2019s teams play, you never get bored.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Samuel Eto\u2019o is convinced that he is the best African footballer of all time and is now targeting more success as a coach, the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/2db433_samuel-eto-is-eyeing-coaching-glorious-playing-career-spanning-two-decades-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
