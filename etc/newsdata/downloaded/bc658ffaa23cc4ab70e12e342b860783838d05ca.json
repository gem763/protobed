Should the world's most unpredictable racing series be worried?", "language": "en", "text": "Mercedes -- winners of the last five Formula One driver and team titles -- plan to make more than a splash when they join Formula E in Season Six.\n\nNico Rosberg, who won the F1 title for the German giants in 2016, has already warned CNN : \"When Mercedes come, they come to win.\"\n\nWith the Silver Arrows targeting Formula E success, should the sport be worried its days of open competition will soon be over?\n\nReasons to be fearful\n\nMercedes have taken a unique approach to their debut season by sending the HWA Racelab team out on track in Season Five as Formula E guinea pigs.\n\nIt's not the first time that Mercedes and HWA have worked together, as HWA CEO and team principal Ulrich Fritz explains.\n\n\"The A of AMG in Mercedes-AMG is for Hans Werner Aufrecht\" Fritz tells CNN. \"He sold the AMG road car business to Mercedes in 1998 but decided to continue racing, so HWA is the spin-off and the first letters of his name.\n\n\"We have a long history with Mercedes and a lot of successes together. We are the most successful ever team in DTM (the German Touring Car Championship) and, with Mercedes, we won a bunch of driver, manufacturer and team titles.\n\nJUST WATCHED When Silver Arrows dominated F1 Replay More Videos ...

That spreads out the field too much in terms of being able to compete.\n\n\"But since day one Formula E has been pretty obsessed with keeping costs under control so that teams can exist and not go bust, and that keeps the competition closer.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that the teams with the biggest budgets in F1 -- Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull -- are the teams consistently at the front of the pack. Mercedes and Ferrari reportedly spent $400m in 2018 with Red Bull dishing out $310 million.\n\nThey can dedicate more resources into designing and testing new parts for the car to increase its on-track performance.\n\nThe Formula E rulebook simply doesn't allow for that kind of technical naval-gazing; all the teams race with the same Gen2 cars and batteries and can only customize the car's powertrain and software.\n\nFIA regulations also say the cost of a ready-to-race car and powertrain \"shall not exceed\" 817,300 euros ($916,552).\n\nJUST WATCHED Formula E car vs. the fastest animal Replay More Videos ...

Having new drivers and a new team hurts you more.\n\n\"You need to operate on zero mistakes in Formula E or otherwise it is incredibly tough to succeed.\n\n\"We have really learnt a lot and prepared the team we want to have next year. It's not just about knowledge and pure skill, it is about experience and that is what we're trying to put together.\"\n\nIt's been a steep learning curve for the HWA Racelab team in Season Five\n\nEven with more experience, it may ultimately be impossible for anyone to completely master Formula E's unique formula of one day racing on ever-evolving city center circuits.\n\nAnd the brains behind the electric racing series are always looking for new ways to make the racing less predictable and the title race even more exciting.\n\n\"This season Formula E implemented a new qualifying format that pretty much guarantees that none of the championship leaders start from the front of the grid,\" explains Nicholls.\n\n\"They go out first in qualifying so they get the worse track. That is an active sporting decision to try and mix it up and keep it random -- and it works.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Vergne clinches Formula E title in New York Replay More Videos ...

It sounds stupid but you haven't actually achieved much if you win in FE -- it's so unpredictable that you can get a pole and a win if things fall into your favor.\n\n\"It's the sustained championship fight and the consistency that's important and I don't think Mercedes will be challenging for the championship in their first year.\"\n\nAnd what does the founder of Formula E think will happen when the silver sharks that have gobbled up the F1 competition enters his pond?\n\n\"They will struggle to have a big advantage like they have in Formula 1,\" Agag tells CNN.\n\n\"The window of technology is a lot smaller, the driver makes a big, big difference and the car is not as decisive.\n\n\"No I don't see [Mercedes domination] happening -- and I don't think anyone is particularly worried about it.\"\n\nThe new Formula E season -- featuring new Mercedes and Porsche teams - begins in the desert heat of Saudi Arabia on 22 November 2019.", "description": "Mercedes are joining the Formula E grid for Season Six -- can anything stop them replicating their era of Formula One dominance in the electric racing world championship?", "authors": ["Sarah Holt", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190718122948-mercedes-formula-e-car-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-18"}
