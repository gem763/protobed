Tigrayans comprise just 6 percent of Ethiopia\u2019s population of 100 million people. But they are perceived as a powerful\u2014and unpopular\u2014minority because of their ethnic affinity with the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which is blamed for monopolizing power over 27 years in the current ruling Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year\u2019s election of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (from the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia\u2019s largest), and the ensuing massive redistribution of power in government\u2014away from the TPLF\u2014ushered in some important and necessary changes for Ethiopia. These have included the opening of borders, the freeing of political prisoners, the lifting of restrictions on media, and the opening of political space to previously banned groups.\n\nBut Tigrayans say that what has not changed\u2014what has only gotten worse\u2014is the narrative embedded in Ethiopian society that they are guilty by association for the problems of the TPLF, which is loathed across Ethiopian society for its corruption and rent seeking.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the country hates us now,\u201d says Weyanay Gebremedhn, a Tigrayan in his twenties.\n\nAnti-Tigrayan sentiments have been erupting more overtly since political shifts began in 2015. Sometimes they become violent, with roads barricaded and Tigrayan homes looted and attacked.\n\n\u201cThey are closing the roads through Amhara and stealing goods from our trucks,\u201d said a Tigrayan businessman in Addis Ababa at the close of 2018. \u201cEthiopia is my country, but the idea of Tigray becoming independent is getting more appealing.\u201d\n\nComprised of 80 different ethnic groups, disagreements between Ethiopia\u2019s diverse parts aren\u2019t rare and frequently spiral into communal violence. But increasingly they have expanded to the regional level and resulted in mass displacements.\n\nIn the first half of 2018, Ethiopia\u2019s rate of 1.4 million new internally displaced people (IDP) exceeded Syria\u2019s. By the end of last year, the IDP population had mushroomed to nearly 2.4 million. Although Tigrayans constitute a relatively small part of overall IDP numbers so far, there\u2019s still a sense it could get much worse for them.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of [lies] and propaganda, and the TPLF has been made the scapegoat for all vice,\u201d said Gebre Weleslase, a law professor at Mekelle University. \u201cThe new prime minister has not said anything when Tigrayans have been attacked, or told the public where these attacks have happened. The ethnic killings carry doubt into the minds of Tigrayans\u2014about 45,000 Tigrayans have left the Amhara region for Tigray in the last four years.\u201d\n\nThe cruel irony is that most Tigrayans have reason to feel betrayed by the TPLF, having endured just as much\u2014if not more\u2014poverty and struggle as the rest of Ethiopia.\n\n\u201cMy father fought for the EPRDF; he was wounded in the head and now works just as a watchman. He might as well be a beggar,\u201d Weyanay says. \u201cThey did nothing for him. Now they are saying they will compensate, but it\u2019s too late as far as I am concerned.\u201d\n\nOne of the few things Weyanay says he is grateful for is the recent rapprochement and opening of the border with Eritrea, with which Tigray shares a border as well as historical, cultural, and familial ties. Weyanay explains that this renewed bond and kinship, in essence an ethnic one, offers some solace when set against the rest of the country\u2019s antagonism toward Tigray.\n\nOthers, however, counter that while Ethiopians may hate the TPLF, they make a distinction with ordinary Tigrayans.\n\nBut when faced with the country\u2019s two largest ethnic groups\u2014the Oromo and Amhara, who together make up over 60 percent of Ethiopia\u2019s population\u2014both of which have long-standing grievances against the TPLF, Tigrayans say it is hard not to fear that their situation could become more precarious.\n\n\u201cThe pace and scale of the change happening in Ethiopia is quite unbelievable,\u201d says Ahmed Soliman, a research fellow with the Africa Program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe impact of inter-communal tensions and ethnic violence presents a serious challenge for the new leadership\u2013in Tigray and elsewhere. Abiy\u2019s aggressive reform agenda has won praise but shaking up Ethiopia\u2019s government risks exacerbating several long-simmering ethnic rivalries.\u201d\n\nTigrayans increasingly feel isolated from their fellow Ethiopians and the political changes taking place more than 750 kilometers to the south in Addis Ababa. Even those Tigrayans who dislike the TPLF now say that its patronage may be their only source of protection.\n\n\u201cThe TPLF political machinery extended everywhere in the country\u2014into the judiciary, the universities\u2014and if everything is flawed, you are going to have a flawed view of reality. It became like something out of George Orwell\u2019s 1984,\u201d Huey says. \u201cBut the fact is that now the TPLF may represent a better evil, as we are being made to feel so unsafe.\u201d\n\nSome say that worsening ethnic tensions in Ethiopia, and the maneuvers politicians are making based on them, could result in worse fighting. They warn that the new prime minister must do more to protect ordinary Tigrayans and show that they are not the enemy if Ethiopia is to transition peacefully to an effective democracy.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister needs to be careful not to allow his targeting of anti-reform elements within the TPLF, to become an attack on the people of Tigray,\u201d Soliman says. \u201cThe region has a history of resolute peoples and will have to be included with all other regions, in order for Abiy to accomplish his goals of reconciliation, socio-political integration and regional development, as well as long-term peace with Eritrea.\u201d\n\nThe current swirl of frustrations, demands, and grievances extend beyond Ethiopia\u2019s borders. The Ethiopian diaspora is particularly active, and while it has done much to speak truth to the power of the former regime, it is in its realm of social media that, perhaps not surprisingly, anti-Tigrayan sentiment has become the most toxic.\n\n\u201cI hope all of you \u2018civil servants,\u2019 police, army, members and cleaners, whores, pimps, gigolos working for #EPRDF die from diarrhoea today,\u201d remarked one lady back in 2017.\n\nSuch vitriol has contributed to making the country\u2019s inherent ethnic fault lines more fragile and susceptible. Walk into an Internet caf\u00e9 in Ethiopia, and the majority at computers are young men hoovering up posts on Facebook or other social media sites, many of whom are out of work and without much chance of improving their prospects.\n\n\u201cTigrayans and other minorities have been targeted in part because of perceptions and even aspirations of other communities, and which have been hammered into people\u2019s minds through organized and persistent propaganda for two decades by domestic and diaspora media and political groupings,\u201d says Addis Ababa-based Daniel Berhane, a blogger and founder of the online magazine Horn Affairs.\n\nIn 1990s Rwanda, radio programs such as Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines spread much of the toxic hatred that fueled the country\u2019s genocide. In today\u2019s Ethiopia, social media appears similarly capable of spreading untruths and stoking tensions.\n\nThus there are Ethiopians across all ethnic groups saying that the time has come to look beyond just criticizing the government and face up to the inherent prejudices and problems that lie at the core of Ethiopian society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the people being willing and taking individual responsibility\u2014the government can\u2019t do everything,\u201d Weyanay says. \u201cPeople need to read more and challenge their assumptions and get new perspectives.\u201d\n\nThe threat posed by ethnic rancor looms large and forebodingly. It\u2019s generally agreed that civil war is unlikely and that comparisons to the likes of Rwanda are clumsy and inappropriate. At the same time, though, surely it is better to err on the side of caution and be heedful of the warning signs.\n\n\u201cEthnic tensions are the biggest problem for Ethiopia right now,\u201d says Tewodrose Tirfe, chair of the Amhara Association of America, a U.S.-based advocacy group. \u201cYou\u2019ve got millions of people displaced\u2014it\u2019s a humanitarian crisis, and it could get out of control.\u201d\n\nJames Jeffrey is a freelance journalist who splits his time between the Horn of Africa, the U.S., and the UK, and writes for various international media.
