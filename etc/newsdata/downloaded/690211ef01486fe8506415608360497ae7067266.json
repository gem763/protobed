The Nationals are headed to their first World Series after disposing of the St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 a proud franchise with 11 World Series titles.\n\nWashington won Tuesday 7-4 before a sellout crowd of 43,976 red-clad lunatics to sweep the four-game series, with the last out setting off fireworks over Navy Yard beyond the centerfield scoreboard.\n\nStarting pitcher Patrick Corbin allowed four runs in five innings but that maligned bullpen, which has discovered October magic, gave up one hit and no runs in four frames.\n\n\u201cSo much energy in this place,\u201d reliever Daniel Hudson, who locked down the last four outs, told The Washington Times during the infield celebration. \u201cThe fans had my back, the players had my back. No panic in these guys.\u201d\n\nIronically it was the Cardinals that beat Washington in five games in the 2012 NLDS after general manager Mike Rizzo decided to shut down ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg for the playoffs as he came back from Tommy John surgery.\n\nThe brash Rizzo, who at least once confronted umpires after a loss, was ripped in the national media for that decision.\n\nBut thanks to the efforts of Strasburg and a stellar starting rotation, the Nationals will bring the World Series to the city for the first time since 1933 when the Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games.\n\nAmong the fans on hand Tuesday was local baseball historian Phil Wood.\n\n\u201cI think of all the players I grew up watching in the 1950s and 1960s who never had an opportunity to experience this,\u201d he told The Washington Times.\n\nWashington clinched its first trip to the Fall Classic \u2013 which begins Oct. 22 in either New York or Houston \u2013 on the 94th birthday of founding owner Ted Lerner. \u201cThis is for you,\u201d Lerner told the fans during the post-game title presentation.\n\n\u201cYeah, we are not done yet,\u201d said third baseman Anthony Rendon, an MVP candidate and pending free agent.\n\nThe Nationals scored seven runs in the first inning as catcher Yan Gomes and shortstop Trea Turner drove in two runs each.\n\nHowie Kendrick scored a run in the first and was named series MVP. His career appeared over in May 2018 when he injured his Achilles while chasing a fly ball in left field \u2013 a position he rarely plays.\n\n\u201cI feel in love with this city, these guys,\u201d said Kendrick, traded to Washington from the rival Philadelphia Phillies during the 2017 season.\n\nThere were tense moments Tuesday as the Cardinals clawed back, but Hudson retired veteran Matt Carpenter with the bases loaded and two outs in the eighth to keep the three-run lead.\n\nNow this Wednesday hump day celebration in the nation\u2019s capital, which hasn\u2019t seen a World Series winner since 1924, harkens back to second-year manager Dave Martinez when he summoned a camel to Florida spring training in 2018.\n\nHe wanted to face head-on the Nationals failure to \u201cget over the hump\u201d after losing in the first round of the playoffs four times before he took over. The Nationals were barely a .500 club in 2018 and the camel became a butt of jokes for failed inspiration.\n\nThen many fans wanted Rizzo to fire Martinez this May, when the Nationals were swept in four games on the road by the New York Mets and fell to 19-31 overall.\n\nThose moments disappeared this October, as the Nationals are 8-2 in postseason play and have won 16 of their last 18 games.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful place,\u201d Martinez told the crowd Tuesday night \u2013 exactly one month after he had to leave the dugout due to heart problems. He returned to the team a few days later.\n\nMartinez preached going \u201c1-0 every day\u201d and the club became the second team in nearly 100 years to go from 12 games under .500 to 24 over by season\u2019s end. His hokey saying, about focusing on the present, induced eye rolls from media and some fans as the 2019 club languished before going over .500 for good June 30.\n\nNow, the Nationals can put to bed embarrassments of the past.\n\nThat includes \u201cNationals\u201d being spelled wrong on its uniforms for one game, the stands at Nationals Park filled with fans of the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets and the time the lights went out in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers a few days after a Taylor Swift concert (she was blamed for the malfunction).\n\nBut those days seem likes ages ago for a franchise that moved from Montreal in time for the 2005 season and lost 100 games in 2008-09.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do it without the support of ownership,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBut it is all about the players.\u201d\n\nRyan Zimmerman, a first baseman who has been with the team since 2005, has spent his entire major league career in Washington and dealt with injuries most of that time.\n\n\u201cI was just happy to be healthy and come back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to earn stuff at this level. I was 20 years old when I got here. We were not very good. We had some chances and couldn\u2019t come through. The fans deserve this as much as we do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
