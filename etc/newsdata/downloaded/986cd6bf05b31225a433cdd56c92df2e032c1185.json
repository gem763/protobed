He also laughed off all the rumours about how he got in shape.\n\nSimon said: \"\"People have said, 'Oh, he's had a gastric fitted' - but I haven't.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"If I had, I would admit to it. This diet is all about what you put into your body. It's not the Atkins diet or anything else. It's just common sense.\"\n\nChatting to Best magazine, he revealed how it was a simple case of cutting out certain things and eating more veggies.\n\n\"It's not hard at all,\" he claimed, \"I met this doctor in LA and he told me my diet was appalling and I had to cut out fatty foods and certain drinks.\n\n\"Within a few weeks, I could see the difference. Cutting out sugar made a massive difference.\n\n\"The first few weeks were difficult, but then I stopped craving sugar. I have also found a brilliant gluten-free beer, which helps.\n\n\"The hardest part is when I see Eric [his son] eat a pizza in front of me.\"\n\nAfter a health scare back in 2017, Simon knew it was time for a change - he fell down the stairs in the middle of the night.\n\nHe also loved to snack on the jam tarts his personal chef would make.\n\nThe Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, broadcast on ITV on 5th November at 8pm.", "description": "Simon's already lost 20lbs with a dedicated vegan diet after a health scare forced him to confront his love of junk food", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747370.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Pride-of-Britain-Awards-2019-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
