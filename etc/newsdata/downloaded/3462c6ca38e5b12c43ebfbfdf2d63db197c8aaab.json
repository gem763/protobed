[JW MARRIOTT SEOUL]\n\nNew York restaurant Gramercy Tavern\u2019s chef Michael Anthony is serving dishes, top and middle, that he created to reflect American contemporary cuisine using Korean ingredients, such as Korean beef, at The Margaux Grill, above, at JW Marriott Seoul. [JW MARRIOTT SEOUL]\n\nA rare opportunity to follow up a gala dinner made by chef Michael Anthony of New York\u2019s popular Gramercy Tavern with an All-American breakfast comes to Seoul this weekend. The famed chef will offer more than a slice of New York on diners\u2019 plates at the JW Marriott Seoul in southern Seoul, from dinner on Saturday night until Sunday morning.The chef, on his second visit to Korea, is here to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the hotel\u2019s reopening last year. Unlike other gala dinners that last for a few hours in the evening, the chef and the hotel decided to offer an event that comes with an overnight stay.Dubbed \u201cGramercy Tavern at JW,\u201d the package includes two tickets to the gala dinner, the book \u201cV is for Vegetables\u201d by chef Anthony as well as the Gramercy Tavern Healthy American Breakfast for two. You can choose to have either a hearty All-American breakfast with pancakes and bacon, or something more refreshing with yogurt and fruit. Both options are centered around the theme of apples.\u201cThe idea behind the room package is to speak to a product that\u2019s famous in our region, as we grow apples better than anyone,\u201d said chef Anthony during his visit to Seoul this week, adding that he is bringing flavors from New York to diners here.\u201cWe want to provide flavors and memories that you want to tell someone else about and that you are reminded of the next day.\u201dFor dinner, he is also bringing a taste of New York, although adapted a bit due to supplies of certain ingredients. The refreshing tomato soup he makes with his team in New York has become a smoked tomato soup for Seoul. He hopes to tell the story of New York intertwined with Seoul because he thinks celebrating the connection between the two restaurants goes a little deeper than improvising a menu using ingredients that he finds in a new city within a few days.\u201cIt is always hard when you take the show on the road and understand how it\u2019s going to feel here,\u201d said the chef, sharing his plan to present the New York cuisine in his own way in Korea. The chef met with the Korea JoongAng Daily to talk about the dishes that will be offered at the hotel and what ideas and inspirations he gets from the Korean food scene in New York.The following are edited excerpts from the interview.. It was a bit of a risk because we have a wide variety of fascinating tomatoes that are grown in our region in the United States. My understanding is there isn\u2019t quite a wide variety of tomatoes in this region in Korea. But I did it anyway because I wanted to tell the story of New York more than I wanted to come here and find out exactly what expresses October here.I add shrimp stock to the tomato soup and put in shrimp as a garnish. At home, we don\u2019t usually do that. It is now not so much about showing the purity of the tomatoes but more about showing how seafood resonate swell with the dish. It will hit home. The use of shells will build more flavors and some gochugaru (hot pepper flakes) will give another depth of flavors. Besides, we will cook over wood, just like we do at Gramercy Tavern, so it will have a smoky quality.I\u2019ve noticed the meals that are most deeply anchored to my memories are all kind of firmly attached to a specific place and time. I\u2019ve always found that it\u2019s a luxury or an opportunity to be a chef in New York in this particular moment, mostly because the American restaurant industry is now out of its infancy.I like the fact that sometimes in the kitchen, it\u2019s best to have short memory. New York has a short memory. We reinvent ourselves every few years. We are not bounded by years and years of history. And only the guiding principle we have as a group of chefs is to try to cook something exciting that remains recognizable, meaning that we try to create a flavor memory you can\u2019t tell someone else about, something that doesn\u2019t disappear. Contemporary American, which we do at the restaurant, is wide open.I want to know how to dry and age seaweed. We are harvesting sugar kelp and I want to learn how Koreans do things here. I [saw] a lot of samples at the market. I did go to the Noryangjin Fish Market with other chefs, and got to see that there are so many different types of shellfish, such as shrimp, and got to see shad, butterfish and a lot more seafood. We did have the blue crab soup, too. I wanted to study more of the basic fermentation, as I saw a lot of squid and octopus covered in gochujang (hot pepper paste). I also want to learn about a variety of peppers that are famous and how they are processed.There is a wide variety of introductions I feel, as a outsider who doesn\u2019t have a long-standing, deep connection to Korean food yet. Yet every 10 years, we see the international attention of chefs fall on a new culture. We saw this in the early 1990s when so many chefs flocked to France, then shifted to Spain, then subsequently to Italy and then to Japan.In the next five years, we will see international attention shift to Korea. It is one of the reasons why I\u2019m here. Korean food\u2019s accessibility, immediacy and depth of flavors with just a few steps of preparation, as well as the use of jang are all fascinating. I have an admiration for Jung-hyun Park of Atoboy and Hooni Kim of Danji and Hanjan, and other chefs because they are following their voices to attract New York diners\u2019 attention.There are now about 30 working in Korea. We are doing a reunion on Sunday.BY LEE SUN-MIN [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]The gala dinner between Gramercy Tavern and The Margaux Grill at the JW Marriott Seoul in Seocho District, southern Seoul, starts with a reception at 6 p.m., featuring a book signing event with chef Michael Anthony, followed by dinner starting at 7 p.m. The dinner is 370,000 won ($309) per person, including tax and service charges, and a prior reservation is required.
