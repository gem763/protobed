Deposit volume tolerances equal to +/- 1% allow for a high level of process control in automotive, electronics, medical, and other production applications.\n\n\u201cCustomers who want assurance that the volume of fluid required is dispensed with exceptional accuracy and consistency, regardless of fluid viscosity or changes in viscosity over time, will get that assurance and more with our new 797PCP systems,\u201d said Claude Bergeron, global product line manager of valves at Nordson EFD.\n\nThe design of the 797PCP is based on the progressive cavity principal where its core components \u2014 a rotor and stator \u2014 form a perfectly sealed metering chamber. As it rotates, the pump allows continuous volumetric dispensing that is unaffected by external factors such as changes in viscosity, fluctuating fluid pressure, and the full-to-empty effect in syringe barrels.\n\nThis continuous seal also prevents shear and pulsation, making the 797PCP ideal for precise dispensing of abrasive pastes, epoxies, and UV-cure adhesives. The pumps come in three sizes \u2014 0.01 mL, 0.05 mL, and 0.15 mL.\n\nThe 797PCP-2K pump provides highly accurate meter mix dispensing of two-part assembly fluids. Its modular design allows for multiple mix ratios. Its compatibility with a wide range of disposable EFD bayonet static mixers simplifies implementation.\n\nBoth the standard and 2K pumps work best when controlled by either 7197PCP-DIN or ValveMate 7197PCP controllers. These controllers allow for precise adjustment of dispensing parameters. The DIN rail version offers an intuitive web-based interface. The ValveMate version offers an intuitive touchscreen interface. Both provide multiple programming modes, including Line, Volume, Weight, and Timed, to meet a wide range of application requirements.\n\nFor more information, email Nordson EFD at info@nordsonefd.com, or call +1 401.431.7000 or 800.556.3484.\n\nAbout Nordson EFD\n\nNordson EFD designs and manufactures precision fluid dispensing systems for benchtop assembly processes and automated assembly lines. By enabling manufacturers to apply the same amount of adhesive, lubricant or other assembly fluid to every part, every time, EFD dispensing systems are helping companies in a wide variety of industries increase throughput, improve quality, and lower their production costs. Other fluid management capabilities include high-quality syringe barrels and cartridges for packaging one- and two-component materials, along with a wide variety of fittings, couplers and connectors for controlling fluid flow in medical, biopharmaceutical and industrial environments. The company is also a leading formulator of specialty solder pastes for dispensing and printing applications in the electronics industry.\n\nAbout Nordson Corporation\n\nNordson engineers, manufactures, and markets differentiated products and systems used for dispensing and processing adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants and biomaterials; and for managing fluids, testing and inspecting for quality, treating surfaces and curing.
