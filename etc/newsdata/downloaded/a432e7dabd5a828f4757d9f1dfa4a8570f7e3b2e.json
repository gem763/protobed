Clearly it means you're doing something well.\n\n'At the back of my head, I've always wanted to play for England. I was born and grown in England.\n\n'My dream was always to play for England. It doesn't effect the fact Nigeria still wanted me, and it's a big nation. I love both nations. My head was just screwed on with England.\n\nTammy Abraham has opted to play for England despite interest from the Nigeria national side\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate is looking for Abraham to fire his team to Euro 2020\n\n'I'm here and I'm ready to stay. I want to do the best I can. That means playing well, for club and country.\n\n'Just hopefully I can get many years experience under my belt for England.'\n\nDespite his brilliant start to the season, Abraham will almost certainly start both qualifiers on the bench given captain Harry Kane is England's undisputed No 1 striker.\n\nBut the 22-year-old hopes Kane's magic will rub off on him.\n\nThe striker said: 'I can learn from Harry, I've come here to steal his ideas. Harry Kane is one of the best strikers in the world. I've come to learn the other parts of his game, and add it to my game as well.\n\n'You see his finishing, left foot, right foot, I just want to take that into my game. So when I go back I can work on myself and practice. Harry's someone I've grown up watching.\n\n'For me he's the best striker in the world. I was always excited to come here, to watch him train, to train with him, and hopefully maybe play with him as well. He's always going to be my idol.\n\n'I'm here to stay, to do well, the best I can, I'm here because right now I'm doing so well, top goalscorer in the league. Hopefully I'll get my chance and take it.'\n\nThe forward has been in red hot form this season with eight goals and is the joint-top scorer\n\nAbraham wheels away after netting for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge against Sheffield United\n\nAbraham's route to becoming Chelsea's main man has been a route of various twists and turns.\n\nA season-long loan spell at Championship side Bristol City in 2016 went swimmingly, as he scored 26 goals for the club.\n\nThe following season his loan spell at Swansea \u2014 who were in the Premier League at the time \u2014 started promisingly as he scored four goals in his opening nine top-flight games.\n\nBut he didn't score another Premier League game until April as the Swans were relegated to raise doubts over his top-level capabilities. But Abraham rediscovered his goalscoring form last season, notching 26 goals as Aston Villa secured promotion to the Premier League.\n\n'For me, those loan spells were good spells for me,' said Abraham. 'To go out and understand. I've had loans where I've gone out and seen the real world, especially with Swansea.\n\nHe has featured for England's youth teams helped the U21 side win the Toulon Tournament\n\n'My first experience in the Premier League was quite tough. I learned about the other side of the football.\n\n'Not just winning games but losing them and not dominating possession. Just little things like that has turned me into a man. And I've taken it back to Chelsea. It's still early doors. But I am happy with the way I've started.\n\n'I've had other experiences when I've gone out on loan again \u2014 back into the Championship, which wasn't ideal for me at the time but brought a lot of positives.\n\n'Going back into the war zone, as they call it, I got to toughen up. Although I didn't score as many goals at Swansea as I would have liked to, I got to enjoy football again and started scoring at Villa and then had a great end to the season.\n\n'I've always believed in myself, it's still early. I've got to keep on trying to help the team.'", "description": "The Chelsea striker is in line for his competitive England debut in the Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria after a recall by England manager Gareth Southgate.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/23/19464688-0-image-a-3_1570572439749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
