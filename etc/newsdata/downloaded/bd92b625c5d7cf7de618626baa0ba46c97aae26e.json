Thanks everyone for all the marathon training tips \u2014 I'll be incorporating them this week on my long runs.\n\nRelatedly, this week I put on a continuous glucose monitor for the first time with the much-appreciated help of a BI colleague. It's been interesting to get a sense of where my blood sugar is at any time of the day, especially during runs. For those who wear one/have experimented with it for performance purposes, what do I need to try out? Let me know at lramsey@businessinsider.com.\n\nAre you new to our newsletter? You can sign up for Dispensed here.\n\nThe Amazon Care website Amazon\n\nRetailers are betting big on healthcare\n\nThis week was illuminating as far as understanding more about what companies like Best Buy and Amazon are doing in healthcare. Here's a rundown of all that we learned this week.\n\nWalmart:\n\nBest Buy:\n\nAmazon:\n\nClarrie Feinstein has the story on Amazon Care, the latest move by Amazon to get ahold of healthcare costs for its employees. This time, it's through virtual doctor visits, in-home care and prescription delivery. Amazon just launched a health clinic pilot program. It's the latest sign the company wants to upend US healthcare.\n\nRelated to the virtual piece of Amazon's new push into healthcare, Emma and I took a look at the trend of companies in the pharmacy space tacking on telemedicine to connect consumers to the medications they might be shopping around for.\n\nThe latest case: Prescription-coupon aggregator GoodRx has acquired telemedicine startup HeyDoctor to do just that.\n\nAlong the lines of retail going deep on healthcare, here's something I think about a lot.\n\nMy colleagues over on the retail desk have been tracking the number of store closures over the past few years, the dreaded \"Retail Apocalypse.\"\n\nAnd sure, retailers including pharmacies aren't immune to it (see: Walgreens closing 200 stores, announced in August).\n\nBut at the same time, I've been reporting on initiatives like the new Walmart Health clinic in Dallas, Georgia that fills up a big part of the Supercenter there, and new primary care and urgent care companies that find themselves taking up space in real estate once occupied by outlet stores or other strip mall inhabitants.\n\nAll that is to say, I haven't come to a firm conclusion of what that means for the future of retail, apart from the very apparent trend that Americans are paying more for their healthcare than ever before.\n\nHave you all been seeing this too? Curious what you think, if there are other factors I haven't considered, or if anybody's read the tea leaves and has figured out where this is headed. I'm at lramsey@businessinsider.com.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man uses a vaping product in the Manhattan borough of New York Reuters\n\nThe growing vaping problem\n\nOver the past few weeks, it's been worrisome to watch as the number of deaths connected with vaping continue to climb. As of September 24, at least 12 people have died, while hundreds more have come down with a mysterious illness, whose symptoms include things like chest pain, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. BI and Insider's health teams have been following along closely (you can catch all of the coverage here), but here are some highlights.\n\nIn other drama...\n\nEmma read through the 59-page letter Novartis sent to the FDA about a data manipulation issue that happened with the world's most expensive drug. Here's what she learned from it.\n\nControversy is swirling around the world's most expensive drug. Here's everything we just learned in a new 59-page letter from Swiss drug giant Novartis.\n\nAnd last Friday, Dakin Campbell and I had the scoop on some of the fallout of the SmileDirectClub initial public offering.\n\nSmileDirectClub's IPO was such a disaster that the CEO called up JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon to ask what went wrong\n\nI'll leave you with this piece from Clarrie, about an app that's being used to treat back pain. I, for one, would love to hear/see how it works.\n\nAn app that promises to treat a common and debilitating condition just got $8 million to break into the US market \u2014 and it's the latest sign of how tech is reshaping healthcare\n\nProgramming note: The whole (!) team will be in New York next week. Erin, Emma and I are moderating a whole bunch of sessions at the CB Insights Future of Health conference, so be sure to say hi if you're passing through.
