Companies there relied on market finance for more than a quarter of their funding last year, a percentage similar to the United States, although down from 34% in 2017.\n\nDespite the decline in market finance, overall funding to EU companies rose last year, pushed by a 7% increase in the volume of bank loans, the AFME report said, a development that runs contrary to the goal set by the EU's finance commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis to reduce reliance on banks.\n\nDombrovskis, whose mandate has been renewed for other five years, said this month that strengthening the bloc's capital market union was among its top priorities.\n\nThe AFME report also said EU savers reduced their investments in financial products last year, stashing more money in bank deposits or simply keeping it in cash.\n\nIn a more positive development, the EU confirmed its global leadership in green bonds last year and saw an increase in securitisations and other arrangements to transform bank loans into tradable financial products - instruments that if not abused can boost banks' lending to firms and households.", "description": "By Francesco GuarascioBRUSSELS, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Companies in the European Union  sharply reduced the amount of money they raised on debt markets  last...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
