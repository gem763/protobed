I haven\u2019t made a decision on Game 4,\u201d Martinez told reporters. \u201cI talked to Corbin a little bit. He\u2019s going to go throw today and we\u2019ll see how he feels after he plays catch.\u201d\n\nGame 4 is Saturday, which would give Corbin three days rest after throwing just 21 pitches Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s last time out was one to remember. He took a no-hitter into the eighth inning of Game 1 of the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, finally allowing his only hit after 7 2/3 innings. In two starts this postseason he\u2019s only allowed one earned run in 12 2/3 innings of work.\n\nThe Nationals took a 2-0 lead on the Houston Astros in Houston and bring the series back to D.C. with a sweep still in play. adTeamadas that win two road games to start a World Series went on to win the series 10 out of 13 times, according to MLB.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
