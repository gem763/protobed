The party\u2019s chairman at the time, Mao Zedong, proclaimed the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nA massive celebration was held in Tiananmen Square, in Beijing, on October 1, 1949. It was the new country\u2019s first National Day. Seventy years on, although it still bears some of the wounds of the past, China has moved forward. Let\u2019s take a look at modern China\u2019s transformation since its founding.\n\nSome schools plan to cancel flag raising ceremony on National Day\n\nEconomy\n\nToday, China plays an important role in global trade, making products that are exported and sold all over the world. Some of its biggest industries include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, and cars.\n\nChina first began its journey to becoming the world\u2019s factory in 1978, when it introduced a series of economic reforms that tackled widespread poverty in the country. For the most part, the reforms worked; between 1978 and 2018, China has lifted some 800 million people out of extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince last year, China also has the second-largest economy in the world. According to China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, it has a GDP, or gross domestic product \u2013 that\u2019s the total value of all goods and services in the country \u2014 of around US$13.5 trillion.\n\nHong Kong government cancels National Day fireworks over public safety concerns\n\nChina also has the second-highest number of billionaires and millionaires in the world, with 338 Chinese billionaires and 3.5 million millionaires, according to CNBC and Bloomberg reports.\n\nBut despite all this wealth, many people in the country still live in poverty. The enormous gap between China\u2019s richest and poorest citizens means that the average living wage in the country is still quite low. On a global scale, China ranks behind more than 70 other countries, out of 180, in standard of living.\n\nThis aerial image taken on June 6, 2019 shows a steel factory in Chengde, China's northern Hebei province.

As of 2017, 11 Chinese taikonauts have travelled in space, including two women, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2018, China launched more satellites into space than any other country, according to the MIT Technology Review.\n\nYang Liwei, who became China's first astronaut in space, emerges from his Shenzhou reentry capsule in October 2003.

According to the World Health Organisation, poor air quality was responsible for 1.03 million deaths in 2012.\n\nThat same year, the International Energy Agency also announced that China was the world\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nHow young people in mainland China are fighting climate change\n\nIn addition to bad air, China also suffers from dirty water. In 2011, 40 per cent of China\u2019s rivers had been polluted by industrial waste \u2013 a side effect of the country\u2019s push for rapid of economic growth.\n\nBut China is making an effort to fix these problems. It is a leading producer of renewable energy technology, according to a New York Times report. In 2011, China had invested US$52 billion in renewable energy projects. And by 2015, more than 24 per cent of China\u2019s energy came from renewable sources.\n\nSevere pollution along the Yangtze River in the eastern Chinese city of Jiujiang.

As of last year, the network covered a total length of 142,500 kilometres \u2014 the longest in the world.\n\nChina also has the longest high-speed railway network in the world. As of 2018, it stretched across 29,000 kilometres. It\u2019s longer the rest of the world\u2019s high-speed rail tracks combined, according to a Forbes magazine report.", "description": "The country has seen many economic, scientific and infrastructure advances since Mao Zedong declared the creation of the PRC in 1949", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/astronaut.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
