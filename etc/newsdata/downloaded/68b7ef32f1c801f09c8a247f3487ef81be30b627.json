This is 100% a problem I have way too often, but as a result I\u2019ve become something of an expert in finding corners to cut so you can get out of the house but still afford your groceries for the rest of the week.\n\nIt really comes down to four basic principles.\n\n1. Nab A Deal\n\nI don\u2019t mean to brag (yes I do), but I am Queen of finding a deal. Want to hit up the theatre? Most of them offer discounts for big groups and some even have discounted rates for under 30s, like the Australian Ballet.\n\nYou\u2019ll also often find discounted tickets for major Melbourne shows at Halftix on Swanston Street, and Arts Centre Melbourne discounts at tixatsix. You have to show up to know, they\u2019re often not advertised.\n\nThen there\u2019s always coupon websites, like Groupon and Scoopon, that I am obsessed with trawling through for cheap event tickets, restaurant deals and random activity ideas at cheaper prices.\n\nREAD MORE How To Master The Subtle Outfit Flex On A Boys' Night Out\n\n2. Find A Cheaper Ride\n\nLet\u2019s be honest here, it sucks sitting on a crowded bus/ train when you\u2019re either excited to get to an event, or tired and desperate to be home after it. Yet taxis and some rideshare services really jack up the prices to the point public transport is your only option.\n\nEnter the new kid on the block in Melbourne, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Geelong and Newcastle, DiDi. It\u2019s the rideshare service with lower fares and options to seat up to six people with their new DiDi Max service, so you can head out with more mates on a night out and share the fare payment.\n\n3. Share A Meal\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I love a food event, like The Night Noodle Market. So often at these things though, I find myself totally stuffed about halfway through a $10+ bowl of noodles.\n\nA simple solution to half the cost and the food wastage? Share it with your mate. If you tend to get through the whole portion, try having a small bite at home first so you don\u2019t need to spend as much money out, but you\u2019ll still be able to get involved.\n\n4. Find A Free Event\n\nWhat\u2019s even better than cheap? Free, mates, free. There\u2019s fun free stuff happening all the time, like famous Japanese art collective teamLab\u2019s Reversible Rotation exhibition and the annual Spring Fling festival.\n\nEven if the whole event isn\u2019t free, there are often parts of it that are. For example, many arts, film and music festivals have some free events \u2013 or at least a festival hub that\u2019s free to get into so you can get the ~vibes~ without the price tag.\n\nREAD MORE Everything You Need To Pack In Yr Overnight Bag For A Big Sexy Date Weekend\n\nYep, that\u2019s really all there is to it. Go forth and become creatures of the night (who also have enough money left over to function during the day).", "description": "Having a night out can be expensive, but you don't want to be stuck at home with nothing to do.
