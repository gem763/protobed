No doubt that the step taken by the Finance Minister is really a bold step to give a real boost to the Indian economy. But, I find that in this process of steep rocketing, Indian equity Indices look to have neglected the prevailing global economic conditions at the same time; where the long-lasting impact of Sino-U.S. trade tussle has been constantly damaging the international trade since October 2018.\n\nAlthough, the Finance Minister Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman has been constantly trying her best to boost the Indian economy since the presentation of Budget on July 5th, 2019; but this is a hard reality that despite her repeated attempts Indian equity markets have been constantly sliding downward. On Friday, this sudden announcement pushed the Indian equity markets once again to test the highest possible levels, where the touched 11,381and Nifty Bank tested 29,417; before starting to move downward.\n\nOn analysis of the movements of and , in different time frames, I find that the current exhaustion may continue during the upcoming week amid growing volatility. No doubt that if the Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty come below their closing levels of September 19th, 2019 during the upcoming week; this will create the largest \u201cExhaustive Candle\u201d in their respective charts. No doubt that the Nifty 50 and Bank Nifty will continue to face sell-offs on every upward moves during the upcoming weeks. The reason is only one, that the steady prices are evident enough to feel the pulse of a global economic slowdown.\n\nNifty 50\n\nNifty 50 - Daily Chart\n\nNifty 50 - 4 Hr. Chart\n\nNifty 50 - 1 Hr.
