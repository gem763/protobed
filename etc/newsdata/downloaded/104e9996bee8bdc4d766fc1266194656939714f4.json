It's also been a big weekend for Argentina, where left-wing populists returned to power in a fresh sign of unrest sweeping across South America, and for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which notched a big win in the Cloud against arch-rival Amazon (NASDAQ: ). Meanwhile in Europe, the EU formally agreed to a three-month extension of the deadline for Brexit. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 28th October.\n\n1. Stocks to open near all-time highs\n\nU.S. stock markets are set to open with a fresh run at all-time highs on Monday after China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said at the weekend that technical consultations on some parts of the interim trade deal being hammered out with the U.S. were \u201cbasically completed.\u201d\n\nBy 6 AM ET, were up 74 points or 0.3%, while the contract was up 0.2% and the contract was up 0.3%.\n\nThe news comes at the start of a big week for global markets, which have been dragged lower for most of the year by the economic slowdown caused by the U.S.-China trade dispute. The dispute has caused an economic slowdown that has forced most of the world\u2019s central banks to ease monetary policy substantially. Both sides have claimed in the last few days that technical agreements on an interim trade are basically completed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s is due to decide on Wednesday whether or not to cut interest rates for a third time this year (Investing.com\u2019s says there\u2019s a 93% chance). That will follow the first reading for in the third quarter. The will hold its own policy-making meeting on Thursday, while the euro zone will release on the same day.\n\n2. Microsoft's JEDI victory over Bezos\n\nThe U.S. government awarded a multi-billion dollar contract for cloud computing services to Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), dealing a blow to Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), the biggest player in the sector.\n\nThe Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, or JEDI as it\u2019s inevitably known, could be worth as much as $10 billion, according to reports.\n\nThe award is the clearest illustration yet of the growing threat to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services\u2019 dominance of the cloud-hosting business. That\u2019s important because AWS has been by far the biggest profit generator for Amazon in recent years. Earnings released last week showed that AWS\u2019s quarterly sales growth slowed to 35%, while Microsoft\u2019s Azure unit grew by 59%.\n\nOthers investing heavily in rivalling Amazon (NASDAQ: ) include Google (NASDAQ: ), Alibaba (NYSE: ) and Oracle (NYSE: ).\n\n3. Alphabet's earnings due; LVMH bids for Tiffany\n\nheads the list of companies reporting quarterly earnings Monday. It\u2019s expected to report earnings per share of $12.28 on $40.3 billion of revenue after the closing bell.\n\nAlso reporting after the bell will be , and chipmaker .\n\nTo get the ball rolling before the opening, there\u2019ll also be updates from and , which will be scrutinized for the pace of debt reduction and the company\u2019s plans for HBO in the ongoing streaming wars.\n\nEarlier in Europe, Spotify (NYSE: ) reported earnings a little ahead of expectations, while Europe\u2019s largest bank HSBC (NYSE: ) signalled a major restructuring ahead after reporting a 24% drop in profit in the third quarter. Meanwhile, LVMH (PA: ) confirmed an approach for Tiffany & Co (NYSE: ), reported to be in the region of $14.5 billion.\n\n4. EU approves Brexit extension\n\nThe European Union formally agreed to a three-month extension of the deadline for Brexit until the end of January 2020, according to a tweet from EU Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nThe exact terms, which will be formalized in writing later, are expected to include the possibility of an earlier exit if the U.K. parliament can ratify the withdrawal agreement struck 10 days ago by the EU and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nThe House of Commons is scheduled to vote later Monday not on the withdrawal agreement, but on whether to hold a general election in December in the hope of breaking the deadlock on Brexit. The chance of the House passing legislation enacting the withdrawal agreement before the proposed election date is slim.\n\nThe posted modest gains to stand at $1.2848, while the inched higher against the dollar to $1.1093\n\n5. Peronists sweep back to power in Argentina\n\nThe left-wing populist candidate Alberto Fernandez won Argentina\u2019s presidential election, posing fresh questions about the stability of the G20 country, which is struggling to meet the terms of its $56 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nArgentina\u2019s central bank immediately tightened existing capital controls, cutting the amount of dollars it would allow people to buy to $200 a month from the previous limit of $10,000.\n\nThe result shows spreading discontent in South America, caused not least by the Fed\u2019s tightening of U.S. interest rates last year and the drop in commodity prices as a result of China\u2019s economic slowdown. In the last month alone, there have been fatal civil disturbances in Chile and Ecuador, the latter of which is also struggling under an IMF program.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEBAI0NN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
