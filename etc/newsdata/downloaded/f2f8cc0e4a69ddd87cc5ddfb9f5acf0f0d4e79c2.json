The impeachment must go forward.\"\n\nBernie Sanders, D-Vt., agreed: \"This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous. In terms of the recent Ukrainian incident. ... [it's] beyond comprehension. ... Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing, and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has been at the top of the crowded field for months but will have to answer persistent allegations by President Trump of overseas wrongdoing. At one point during the debate, CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper stated, without evidence, that President Trump's accusations of misconduct by Biden and his son Hunter were \"false.\"\n\nBut Cooper pressed Biden on Hunter's admission in a televised interview earlier in the day that he made a mistake by obtaining a lucrative role on the board of a Ukraine company, with no relevant expertise, while his father was the vice president and handled Ukraine policy.\n\n\"Look, my sons' statement speaks for itself,\" Biden said, adding that he never acted improperly based on payments his son was receiving from several multinational companies. \"The fact of the matter is, this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focused on.\"\n\nWarren has climbed to co-front runner status but faces new questions about her dubious claims to Native American ancestry. And Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is out to prove he has the stamina for hours on stage, less than two weeks after a heart attack forced him to temporarily suspend campaigning.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: WHERE DO BIDEN, WARREN STAND?\n\nThe other candidates will be struggling just to get noticed \u2014 trying to make up ground in a race that kicks off officially in just over three months with the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3. The 12 candidates were the largest lineup on a single debate stage, topping the 11 GOP candidates who assembled in 2016.\n\nAn hour before the debate began, Pelosi, D-Calif, announced there would be no formal vote on whether to begin the impeachment inquiry. The move was seemingly a boon for moderate Democrats in swing districts, who have been reluctant to have a formal vote in favor of the proceedings as the 2020 elections approach.\n\nThe event, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is on the campus of Otterbein University, just outside Columbus in Ohio, a state that has long helped decide presidential elections but has drifted away from Democrats in recent years.\n\nAge was already a concern for the 78-year-old Sanders, the oldest presidential hopeful, even before he was taken to a Nevada hospital earlier this month and had two stents put in to clear a clogged artery.\n\nHOW DID HUNTER BIDEN MAKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WITH NO RELEVANT EXPERTISE?\n\nSanders and his allies insist the health scare has only strengthened his commitment to the 2020 contest \u2014 and his case for his signature \"Medicare for All\" health care plan.\n\n\"Bernie is a political marathon runner,\" said Sanders' confidante RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of National Nurses United. \"I think the debate is going to be a great reassurance to the public.\"\n\nIn an email to supporters, Sanders wrote, \"Tonight's debate is important, no doubt about it, and I am ready.\"\n\nWarren's campaign said she went for a walk as part of her usual debate day routine \u2014 but the senator was likely to face far more scrutiny than in previous intraparty face-offs.\n\nBiden, 76, and others have jabbed at Warren's intense focus on detailed liberal policies that may be difficult to implement with a divided Congress. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has highlighted the absence of a specific Warren health care plan. She has embraced Sanders' single-payer plan instead.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have raised questions about whether Warren, 70, was actually forced from her teaching job because of a pregnancy nearly a half century ago, a claim that has become a core part of her personal message. Critics have pointed to past speeches and documents that suggest she left on her own. Warren is standing by her story.\n\nThe issue is particularly threatening because it's not the first time she has been accused of embellishing her biography. Warren has already apologized for claiming Native American heritage decades ago. While it showed distant tribal ancestry, it also sparked a rebuke from some Native Americans.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS A 'CAPITALIST'\n\n\"The good news is that most attempts to attack Warren actually make her stronger,\" said Adam Green, a Warren supporter and co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\n\nBiden enters the fourth round of Democratic debates under the weight of intensifying questions from Trump about his family's work overseas.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that Biden's 49-year-old son, Hunter, improperly profited from work in Ukraine and China while the elder Biden was vice president. The president also insists that Biden used his office to protect his son from allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nHunter Biden said in an ABC News interview that aired Tuesday morning he did nothing wrong while engaging in foreign work as a Washington lawyer specializing in corporate governance.\n\nThe younger Biden obtained several lucrative board positions domestically and internationally, with no relevant expertise, while his father was a senator and vice president. Hunter Biden became an executive at the financial services company MBNA just two years after leaving law school. MBNA sources told Fox News this week that the company was trying to curry favor with the elder Biden, who was championing a bill favored by MBNA to passage in the Senate.\n\nIn the interview, Hunter Biden noted he failed to take into account the potential implications for his father's political career.\n\nJoe Biden has promised to bar family members from occupying any office within the White House if elected \u2014 a departure from Trump.\n\nMany other candidates, meanwhile, are fighting for political survival.\n\nButtigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris are trying to crack the top tier. Also debating are New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Obama housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Making his debate debut \u2014 and likely angling for a splash \u2014 is billionaire activist Tom Steyer.\n\nThe 2020 field, which once had swelled to two dozen, has been shrinking as the Democratic Party's rules have mandated that candidates meet higher donor and fundraising thresholds to debate. Just 10 White House contenders qualified for September's debate, but Gabbard and Steyer made Tuesday's a record. Earlier contests featuring 20 candidates were divided between two nights.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nButtigieg further sharpened his critique of Warren's support for Medicare for All on Tuesday by releasing an online ad naming Warren and Sanders. Buttigieg has described Warren as \"evasive\" in how she would finance her health care vision and suggests in the new ad that Medicare for All would force millions of Americans, including workers covered by union contracts, off private insurance.\n\n\"I'm not pushing Medicare for All whether you want it or not,\" says the 37-year-old mayor \u2014 the kind of critique Warren may face more of on the debate stage.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The three Democratic 2020 front-runners were united at\u00a0Tuesday night's presidential debate\u00a0in calling for President Trump's impeachment, even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said only minutes before the debate began that\u00a0there would be no vote on formally beginning an impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
