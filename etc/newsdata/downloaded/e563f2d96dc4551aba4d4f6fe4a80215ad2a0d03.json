Parliament Street, Great Smith Street, and Westminster and Lambeth bridges are expected to be heavily affected.\n\nThe Met Police said it had arrested 280 demonstrators by 9.30pm on Monday night, more than double the 122 arrests made on the first day of similar protests last April.\n\nBy midnight, that number had reached 319. And by 3.30pm on Tuesday, a further 152 arrests had been made - taking the grand total to 471.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson labelled Extinction Rebellion activists as \"uncooperative crusties\" and called on them to abandon their \"hemp-smelling bivouacs\" to allow the capital to function smoothly again.\n\nMr Johnson was speaking at the launch in London of the third volume of Margaret Thatcher's biography by the former editor of\n\nThe Telegraph, Charles Moore, and said: \"The best thing possible for the education of the denizens of the heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs that now litter Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park would be for them to stop blocking the traffic and buy a copy of Charles's magnificent book so that they can learn about a true feminist, green and revolutionary who changed the world for the better.\n\nHe added: \"I hope that when we go out from this place tonight and we are waylaid by importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters, we remind them that she (Mrs Thatcher) was also right about greenhouse gases.\"\n\nMr Johnson said he had been advised by his security staff not to attend last night's book launch \"because they said the road was full of uncooperative crusties and protesters of all kinds littering the road\".\n\n4:45PM\n\nConservative MP collects 'his tree' dedicated to him by Extinction Rebellion\n\nConservative MP John Howell collects his tree from the Extinction Rebellion tree planting protest at Old Palace Yard.\n\nAround 800 potted native trees were placed in the yard.
