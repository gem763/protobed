You save on taxes immediately, the money can be invested for decades, and \u2014 unlike with an IRA or 401(k) account \u2014 you may never have to pay taxes on any of it.\n\nHealth savings accounts are different from flexible spending accounts\n\nPeople often refuse to consider opening a health savings account because they believe it is a flexible spending account. The two are very different.\n\nA flexible spending account, or FSA, is offered through your employer\u2019s health insurance and allows you to set aside up to $2,700 in pretax money (the Internal Revenue Service can raise the limit each year). That money must to be used for eligible out-of-pocket health-care expenses for you and your family that tax year or it is lost, except for $500 that the IRS lets you carry over to the next year. So the FSA can be useful if you have a good idea how high your out-of-pocket expenses will be, and if you don\u2019t contribute too much.\n\nRead: How to make the most of your HSA \u2014 for now, and the future\n\nA health savings account (HSA) works differently. First, you\u2019re only eligible if you have a high-deductible insurance plan. Second, you can shelter much more money from taxes. Up to $3,550 (for an individual) or $7,100 (for a family) in pretax money is withheld by your employer (or set aside by you, especially if you buy your own health insurance) and placed in an HSA each year. (Those are the 2020 limits. Again, the amounts can change every year.)\n\nLike the FSA, you can use money in the HSA to pay for out-of-pocket health-care expenses tax-free. But the HSA doesn\u2019t have a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d feature.\n\nThe beauty of this is that an HSA can work as another way to save money for retirement, especially health-care expenses in retirement. And because you can invest and let the money build up over the years, you can capitalize on the magic of compounding. That $3,550 or $7,100 you set aside this year could double in nine years if you earn a 8.9% average return \u2014 which has been the average compounded annual growth rate for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% over the past 15 years, according to FactSet.\n\nOf course, this assumes you have the ability to pay for today\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses with other funds.\n\nMore advantages\n\nAn opportunity to increase tax-deferred savings may be especially important if you are self-employed or if no employer-sponsored retirement account is available to you. Federal law allows a person with a 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored retirement account to put away up to $19,000 in pretax dollars (plus another $6,000 if you are 50 or older) each year. But the limit for individual retirement account (IRA) contributions is only $6,000, plus another $1,000 if you are 50 or older. (Those are the 2019 limits. The 2020 limits are expected to be announced in November.)\n\nIf you buy your own insurance through an exchange, you might find a high-deductible health plan, known as an HDHP, much more affordable than a low-deductible plan. Of course, the same might be true for health insurance arranged through an employer.\n\nDavid Mendels, director of planning with Creative Financial Concepts in New York, said that for people buying an HDHP through an exchange, an HSA is \u201can absolute no-brainer. You are going to get the tax deduction, you are still going to get the money, and you can get it out tax-free.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the potential for free cash from your employer. Many match contributions into an HSA up to a certain limit. In its year-end HSA research report, Devenir (which provides investment services to HSA administrators) estimated that the average employer contribution to an HSA increased to $839 in 2018 from $604 in 2017.\n\nHere\u2019s how you avoid taxes when you take out the money\n\nOnce you are 65, you can withdraw money from your HSA for any purpose, rather than just to cover health costs. If you spend it on qualified health-related expenses, the withdrawal is tax-free, as it is at any age. If you take money out for another reason, you will have to pay income taxes.\n\nYou might even \u201creimburse yourself,\u201d tax-free, for qualified medical expenses you had paid for out-of-pocket in earlier years. Not tapping your HSA for out-of-pocket expenses now means you can enjoy the benefit of tax-deferred growth longer while still claiming the benefits of tax-free health-related spending.\n\nUnlike an IRA or 401(k) account, there is no required minimum distribution from an HSA at age 70 1/2. Considering how likely it is for you to have high medical expenses later in life, it is quite likely that some or all of the HSA money will never be taxed.\n\nAsk yourself these questions\n\nTo participate in an HSA, you need to be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, which means the annual deductible needs to be $1,400 for an individual and $2,800 for a family. The HDHP\u2019s annual out-of-pocket maximum cannot exceed $6,900 for an individual or $13,800 for a family. (Those are the 2020 numbers).\n\nThe higher deductibles and higher potential out-of-pocket maximum figures may be a little scary. However, this is where a potential opportunity lies.\n\nHere are questions you should answer as part of your HSA decision-making process:\n\n\u2022 How much would you save in premiums if you participated in a high-deductible health insurance plan instead of a more expensive plan with lower deductibles?\n\n\u2022 Would this savings from lower premiums exceed the amount of the additional deductible?\n\n\u2022 If you add in your employer\u2019s contribution (if any) to an HSA, would that plus your premium savings exceed the additional deductible?\n\n\u2022 How much higher would the maximum potential out-of pocket potential expense be with the high-deductible health insurance plan than with the low-deductible plan?\n\n\u2022 Finally, you need to think about your particular circumstances. Do you or members of your family have serious ongoing medical conditions that might make the low-deductible plan the best one for you?\n\nMendels said it may also be important to think about treatments or doctors that may not be covered by your insurance. \u201cThere is a much broader range of expenses you can cover with the HSA than would be covered by virtually any medical plan,\u201d he said. One example he named was a New Jersey resident who has a doctor in New York not covered by her insurance plan.\n\nOnce you answer these questions, you can decide for or against a HDCP/HSA combination.\n\nIf you are buying health insurance through an exchange, your decision points are pretty much the same, except that there is no employer contribution to the HSA.\n\nKen Roberts, an investment adviser with IWC Asset Management in Carmel, Calif., said that some people are reluctant to consider an HSA because they take a very simple approach: They want the lower deductible.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI like the HSA because if you don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s still savings that didn\u2019t go to the insurance company. That gives you an edge.\u201d\n\nDean Mason, CEO of HealthSavings Administrators, prefers to call a high-deductible health plan a \u201clow-premium plan.\u201d\n\nMason, a former CEO of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s UNH, -0.67% Optum Health Bank (a health savings account administrator), said many employers \u201cdo a bad job explaining how much is coming out of your paycheck.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you find in the low premium plan is that the savings you accrue on the premium tend to fully cover your out-of-pocket risk,\u201d he said. This is, of course, more likely if your employer matches some of your HSA contribution.\n\nHealthSavings Administrators is based in Richmond, Va., has about $818 million in assets under management and runs HSA plans for employers and individuals. The company is held by BluffPoint Associates, a private-equity firm in Westport, Conn.\n\nOnce you decide on an HSA\n\nIf you have an HSA through your employer, your contributions will probably be made with pretax dollars withheld from your pay, hopefully with a matching contribution from the employer. You can also choose to fund an HSA outside of work. This may be a good option if there is no matching contribution available or if you find your employer\u2019s HSA plan too expensive or that its investment offerings too limited.\n\nIf you qualify for an HSA when buying your own health insurance through an exchange, you will need to go to an HSA administrator on your own to make contributions.\n\n\u201cOn the most elementary level, just like with your 401(k), if you are going to participate, before you do, take a look at what the expenses are. A particular HSA may be so expensive that it is not worth doing,\u201d Mendels said.\n\nNot only do you need to know about an HSA\u2019s administrative expenses, you need to know what investments, if any, will be available.\n\nEric Remjeske, co-founder and president of Devenir, pointed to HSASearch, a website run by his company, where you can compare HSAs\u2019 administrative expenses and investment choices. If you click \u201call HSA providers\u201d on the top left, you can see that scores of providers have no administrative fees, but the majority also have no investment options available. This means you would be following a FSA-like \u201csave and spend\u201d model, possibly wasting some of the benefits of your HSA. The site has various other tools you can use to compare HSAs if you are looking for your own provider.\n\nIf you enroll in an HSA through your employer, the plan administrator may place your money in a money-market fund (earning a very low interest rate) by default. One reason for this is that you may be required to build up a minimum cash balance before investing the rest of the money in mutual funds for long-term growth. This makes sense, because even if you are using your HSA a long-term investing vehicle, you may need to tap some of the money to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses at any time.\n\nBut the default choice means many participants will never change the investment selections for their HSAs. This can lead to a tremendous loss of potential investment returns over the years, or decades. A phone call to your plan administrator to discuss your investment options, and their costs, is time well spent.\n\nIn its year-end industry report, Devenir estimated that only 19% of HSA balances were invested as of Dec. 31, with the rest sitting in cash. Devenir also estimated that the number of HSA accounts increased by 13% during 2018 to 25 million and that total assets in HSA accounts grew by 19% to $53.8 billion.\n\nHSA investment selections and fund fees\n\nMason touted the benefits of \u201cinvestment-focused HSAs\u201d that allow participants \u201cfirst-dollar investing,\u201d rather than requiring a cash balance to be accumulated first. At HealthSavings Administrators, participants have no minimum balances and can \u201cinvest in institutional-class funds right away, max out their contributions, and start accumulating assets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose initial dollars make a difference when treating HSAs like the long-term investment vehicle they are,\u201d he added.\n\nThe emphasis on institutional share classes is an important one for investors seeking those managers who stock-pick, or what\u2019s called active management. Note that active managers on average struggle to outperform funds that passively track an index, especially over multiple years.\n\nYour obvious path to the lowest expenses is to select broad index funds with low expense ratios. But if you want to diversify with active management, an institutional share class can have much lower expenses than a share class normally offered to individuals.\n\nIn addition to offering lower-cost institutional shares for actively managed funds, HealthSavings Administrators also offers some of the lowest-cost index funds through Vanguard, including the Vanguard 500 Index Fund\u2019s Admiral shares VFIAX, +0.29%, which have annual expenses of only four basis points.\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "Forget your preconceived notions about health savings accounts and figure out whether an HSA might improve your finances.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI707_reflex_ZG_20190502102213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-08"}
