The Redskins tight end has scored plenty of touchdowns in his career \u2014 63, to be precise \u2014 but none quite like his dazzling first-quarter score in Sunday\u2019s 32-27 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe 35-year-old said he was thinking of his grandfather, Lynwood Smith, who died on Saturday. Growing up in the District, Davis lived with his grandparents for the first 18 years of his life, and his grandfather was a \u201cbig influence\u201d who taught him everything he knew, from simple tasks like changing light bulbs and fixing doors to life\u2019s most important lessons.\n\n\u201cHe meant everything to me,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe was like my father.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the game, Davis said he wasn\u2019t able to fully enjoy the touchdown because of the Redskins\u2019 loss. But the play itself was remarkable. After hauling in a short play-action pass from Case Keenum, Davis ran down the sideline, easily jumping in stride would-be-tackler Ronald Darby on the way to a 48-yard score.\n\nDavis, who looked like an Olympic hurdler on the play, wasn\u2019t surprised at his burst of pure athleticism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it before when I was in San Francisco,\u201d said Davis, who finished with four catches for 59 yards \u201cI\u2019ve done it quite a few times. It\u2019s just something you can\u2019t really think about. You just react. There\u2019s no telling when you can do it. You just react and play ball.\u201d\n\nDavis takes pride in the length of his career. The veteran is entering his 14th season and has played a full 16 games in seven of them. Davis said he takes care of himself and hasn\u2019t had any surgeries. \u201cKnock on wood,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite his age, he\u2019s still a valuable contributor. Against the Eagles, he surpassed Shannon Sharpe to become sixth among tight ends all-time in touchdowns.\n\nWith the Redskins, Davis has played an important role backing up the oft-injured Jordan Reed. The Redskins Sunday were again without Reed, who missed the game with a concussion. Offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said last week he \u201cloves\u201d having Davis as a weapon because it gives the Redskins a \u201c1a, 1b\u201d option at tight end.\n\nDavis, meanwhile, said he was appreciative he was able to score. He noted that he had yet to lose someone as close to him as his grandfather.\n\n\u201cDespite the loss, I was still able to help them fight,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest part, if you can come out and fight. \u2026 I feel like I put up a good fight.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
