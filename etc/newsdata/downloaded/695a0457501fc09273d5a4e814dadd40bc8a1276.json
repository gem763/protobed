The GFIN also comprises regulators such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as well as business groups like the UAE\u2019s Abu Dhabi Global Market.\n\nFellow American regulators the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also announced they were joining the GFIN, per a joint press release shared by the SEC.\n\nThe GFIN was launched in summer last year, and has spoken of creating a \u201cglobal sandbox\u201d testbed for companies to \u201ctrial cross-border [financial] solutions.\u201d\n\nThe move comes just over a week after a G7 taskforce instructed member states to revamp the conventional financial system to respond to threats from alternative financing tools, including cryptocurrencies and global stablecoins.\n\nThe G7 made particular mention of the inefficient and costly nature of cross-border transactions within the existing system.\n\nIt's not the first time national authorities join forces in order to address challenges brought by new technologies. In July 2018, international coalition against tax criminals, J5, that also targets crypto-related crimes, was formed as a response to a request to reduce tax crime, made by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nMeanwhile, the CFTC\u2019s Chairman Heath Tarbert says that the regulator\u2019s fintech research facility, LabCFTC, will become an independent operating office.\n\nLabCFTC will continue to report directly to the chairman, and will conduct research into cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nTarbert stated, in an official release,\n\n\u201cBlockchain, digital assets and other developments hold great promise for our economy. Now is the time for LabCFTC to play an even greater role as we work to develop and write the rules for these transformative new products. That reality requires engagement at the highest levels within the CFTC, which is why I am elevating LabCFTC to be an independent operating office of the agency.\u201d\n\nThe CFTC says LabCFTC is its \u201cbeachhead in the emerging world of fintech,\u201d and claims that it will help \u201cbring regulators and innovators together.\u201d", "description": "Some of America\u2019s most powerful financial regulators \u2013 including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2013 have announced they will join the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN).", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5db/282953b429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
