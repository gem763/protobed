Instead of taking on the real issues, they are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\n\n\u2018Make no mistake, these plans will leave tens of thousands of legitimate voters voiceless. Ministers should focus on combating the real threats to our democracy, rather than suppressing voters\u2019 rights.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018This gamble with our democracy will strike many voters as US-style gerrymandering, with Britain\u2019s tradition of trust at the ballot box abolished in one swoop. Ministers must think again.\u2019\n\nThe ERS told the Guardian it estimates photo ID for voting would cost up to \u00a320 million to enforce per election.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
