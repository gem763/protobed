On August 10, 2019, he died in an apparent jailhouse suicide. For more information, see The Daily Beast's reporting here.\n\nAs the Harvey Weinsteins of the world get their comeuppance in the press and in court, another serial predator walks free.\n\nLast month, after a flood of allegations by Hollywood actresses, Weinstein was indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges in New York. The disgraced Hollywood executive stands accused of assaulting one woman in 2004 at Miramax headquarters in TriBeCa and raping another woman at a Midtown hotel nine years later. He has pleaded not guilty to these crimes.\n\nSince Weinstein\u2019s reign of terror was exposed and ignited a #MeToo reckoning, other powerful men have found themselves publicly censured or even toppled over their dark pasts and allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nBut the Weinstein Effect seems to have spared one Jeffrey Epstein\u2014a 65-year-old billionaire and convicted sex offender who\u2019s palled around with former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen, and other high-flying friends whose names were revealed in his \u201clittle black book\u201d and flight logs for his private jet. Many of them enjoyed jaunts to Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island and mansions in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nEven President Trump was among the deviant philanthropist\u2019s admirers. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\u201d Trump told New York in 2002. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it\u2014Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d\n\nJeffery\u2019s \u201csocial life,\u201d according to police and a score of lawsuits, involved a pedophile ring of dozens of underage girls, whom he groomed and then loaned out to powerful friends. But aside from a minor conviction in Florida\u2014for which he served a mere 13 months\u2014Epstein has emerged remarkably unscathed. New York authorities have never charged him with any crime, and he still drops into his Upper East Side mansion, where women have been photographed coming and going, according to tabloid reports. His sex offender registration lists his primary address as St. Thomas.\n\nThe mysterious financier\u2019s sick world was unmasked in March 2005, when the stepmother of one 14-year-old victim phoned police and said a wealthy man had molested her child. She\u2019d received a call from a schoolmate\u2019s mom, who overheard her own daughter discussing \u201chow [the victim] had met with a 45-year-old man and had sex with him and was paid for it,\u201d a police report said. Around that time, a teacher found $300 in the girl\u2019s purse.\n\nPalm Beach detectives would soon unearth five girls who claimed that Epstein had lured them into a ring of sexual abuse. By the time Epstein inked his plea agreement, the feds had identified 40 victims. Police said Epstein was enlisting his employees and other young women to recruit underage girls\u2014many of them underprivileged or from broken homes\u2014for massages at his home. One recruiter told police that Epstein advised her, \u201cThe younger, the better.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\u2019 Trump told New York in 2002. \u2018He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe teens, some as young as 13, were ordered to remove their clothes. During the massages, Epstein would masturbate himself and molest his victims, according to both lawsuits and police reports. Sometimes, according to court records, he forced them into intercourse with him or into performing sex acts with an assistant, whom he allegedly bragged of purchasing as a sex slave from her parents in Yugoslavia. Afterward, the victims said, Epstein usually paid them $200 or $300 and as much as $1,000.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never denied girls came to the house,\u201d Jack Goldberger, Epstein\u2019s defense attorney, told the Palm Beach Post in July 2006. But Epstein didn\u2019t know the girls\u2019 ages, Goldberger said, and took a polygraph test to prove it. \u201cHe passed on knowledge of age,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nIn court filings responding to victims\u2019 lawsuits, Epstein said each teenager \u201cconsented to and was a willing participant in the acts alleged\u201d and that he \u201creasonably believed\u201d they were 18 years old during the \u201calleged acts.\u201d\n\nEpstein eventually walked free with a slap on the wrist, even after Florida cops took their case from state prosecutors to the FBI and U.S. attorney\u2019s office.\n\nIn June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to two state charges: solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution. In an unusually sweet deal with federal prosecutors, he served 13 months of his 18-month sentence in the private wing of a Palm Beach county jail and was permitted to leave six days a week, for 16 hours each day, for \u201cwork release,\u201d according to local press reports. Epstein agreed to register as a sex offender for life, as well as fund attorneys for more than 40 victims who filed lawsuits against him for damages.\n\n\u201c Epstein\u2019s high-powered legal team, which included Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, supplied prosecutors with dossiers on the alleged victims in an effort to discredit them. \u201d\n\nEpstein has continued to make headlines in the decade since his conviction, as his alleged victims pursue him in court. One accuser, Virginia Roberts, came forward to the Daily Mail in 2011 to claim that Epstein flew her across the world to \u201cmeet\u201d Prince Andrew when she was 17 years old. The litigation from Roberts and other Jane Does has untangled more sinister layers of Epstein\u2019s operation\u2014including alleged sex crimes that occurred in New York but apparently went unprosecuted. (In depositions for the civil cases, Epstein has pleaded the Fifth when asked about his sexual activity with underage girls.)\n\nHis name resurfaced during the 2016 election season, when a woman using the pseudonym Katie Johnson filed a lawsuit against Trump, claiming he raped her at one of Epstein\u2019s parties when she was just 13 years old. She dropped the suit months later.\n\nTrump called Johnson\u2019s claims \u201cnot only categorically false but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period,\u201d Trump concluded, while lawyers for Epstein didn\u2019t appear to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nEpstein came up again during Trump labor secretary nominee Alexander Acosta\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing. Acosta was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida who oversaw the pervy money manager\u2019s plea deal.\n\n\u201c Protesters on both sides of the political aisle are now using Epstein\u2019s reputation as ammo. \u201d\n\nIn a 2011 letter, Acosta said the negotiations came after a \u201cyear-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d and added that \u201cthe defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered.\u201d\n\nEpstein\u2019s high-powered legal team, which included Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz (who is now working for Weinstein and is a legal ally of President Trump), supplied prosecutors with dossiers on the alleged victims in an effort to discredit them. The counter-investigation included copies of some of the girls\u2019 MySpace.com profiles which showed drug and alcohol use, according to cops. Epstein\u2019s strategy included hiring private eyes to follow witnesses, including one victim\u2019s father, police said.\n\nLast month, the FBI released heavily redacted memos on the Epstein probe, and one offered a hint as to the reason for his lenient treatment: \u201cEpstein has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what dirt he might have given the feds. Epstein was once a limited partner at Bear Stearns and abruptly quit in 1981. Around the time of his plea deal, the investment bank\u2019s role in the subprime mortgage crisis could have been of great interest to the feds. Epstein reportedly lost $57 million in the subprime meltdown.\n\nProtesters on both sides of the political aisle are now using Epstein\u2019s reputation as ammo. On June 6, a Philadelphia Trump supporter interrupted Bill Clinton at his book event to shout, \u201cWhy did you fly on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Lolita Express 26 times? Twenty-six times, Bill. Why, what were you doing on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s plane?\u201d\n\nThe activist, Howard Caplan, was referring to the press\u2019 nickname for Epstein\u2019s private jet. \u201cLook it up. Jeffrey Epstein!\u201d Caplan yelled before security took him away.\n\nMeanwhile, at a rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday, President Trump booted a protester who hoisted an old photo of him with the accused sex fiend. The text on the demonstrator\u2019s poster simply asked: Who is Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nNow two cases could propel Epstein back into the spotlight\u2014including one where Roberts, who claimed Epstein kept her as his \u201csex slave,\u201d is expected to testify against him in a Florida trial.\n\nIf Epstein appears, it would be the first time he has to face his alleged victims in court.\n\nAccording to the fine print of his once-confidential plea deal, Epstein could have been charged with federal offenses involving sex acts with minors. If convicted of such crimes, he could have spent decades or even life behind bars.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s continued to enjoy the fruits of his wealth, flitting between the Virgin Islands and New York City, where tabloid shutterbugs have captured him strolling the Upper East Side with different women. One New York Post report said Epstein houses Russian models at his 51,000-square-foot palace on East 71st Street.\n\nAt a sex offender registration hearing in 2011, a Manhattan assistant prosecutor asked a judge to go easy on Epstein by making him a Level 1 fiend, or the lowest on the scale. The assistant DA claimed Epstein shouldn\u2019t be forced to register at Level 3, which indicates a high risk of repeat offense, because \u201cthere was only an indictment for one victim\u201d in Florida, the New York Post reported. The judge disagreed and labeled him Level 3, a decision that was upheld on appeal. \u201cI\u2019m not a sexual predator, I\u2019m an \u2018offender.\u2019 It\u2019s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel,\u201d Epstein told the Post a month later.\n\nMeanwhile, last year, a woman named Sarah Ransome sued Epstein in Manhattan federal court, claiming he trafficked her for sex from October 2006 through April 2007\u2014all while his attorneys were waging war against the federal charges in Florida. Ransome, originally identified under the pseudonym Jane Doe 43, differs from other Epstein victims who\u2019ve filed lawsuits in that she was in her early twenties when he allegedly sexually abused her.\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019m not a sexual predator, I\u2019m an \u2018offender.\u2019 It\u2019s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel,\u2019 Epstein told the Post. \u201d\n\nWhen asked about Ransome\u2019s allegations, and whether Epstein would be investigated for sex-trafficking, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York said they do not comment on people who haven\u2019t been charged. The office also does not comment on whether someone is under investigation.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nRansome\u2019s complaint was filed in the same district where Harvey Weinstein and his companies face a pair of class-action lawsuits accusing the ex-mogul and his associates of running a mafia-like operation that perpetuated and covered up his sexual harassment, assault and rape of women seeking work opportunities.\n\nYoung, vulnerable girls and women likewise say they sought opportunities with Epstein. A South Africa native living in New York, Ransome dreamed of attending the Fashion Institute of Technology (F.I.T.). Then she met Natalya Malyshev, whom she alleges was Epstein\u2019s recruiter. Malyshev said she\u2019d introduce Ransome to \u201ca wealthy philanthropist who regularly used his wealth, influence and connections to help financially poor females like [Ransome] achieve their personal and professional goals and aspirations,\u201d court papers allege.\n\nHer case is pending U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl\u2019s ruling on motions to dismiss filed by Epstein and his fellow defendants. The complaint is against Malyshev, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who was accused by Roberts of helping Epstein procure girls and of molesting the girls herself, and Epstein\u2019s assistants Sarah Kellen and Lesley Groff. (Kellen and Groff were listed as co-conspirators in Epstein\u2019s federal plea deal. At the time of the alleged crimes, Kellen was in her late twenties; Groff is also believed to have been an adult during Ransome\u2019s alleged abuse.)\n\n\u201c According to Ransome, Epstein didn\u2019t quit his sex-abuse operation. Instead, he allegedly transported young women from other U.S. cities and abroad to his residences in New York and the Virgin Islands. \u201d\n\nDuring Epstein\u2019s plea negotiations, he departed Palm Beach for New York and the Virgin Islands \u201cin order to convey an image to prosecutors that he and his co-conspirators had stopped committing sex crimes,\u201d her lawsuit states.\n\nStill, according to Ransome, Epstein didn\u2019t quit his sex-abuse operation. Instead, he allegedly transported young women from other U.S. cities and abroad to his residences in New York and the Virgin Islands, the complaint says.\n\nWhen Ransome met Epstein, he allegedly promised to get her into F.I.T. or another school. She claims the other defendants \u201cconfirmed and reiterated this promise\u201d and assured her many times that Epstein would advance her education. For her part, Maxwell told Ransome she would need to give Epstein massages \u201cin order to reap the benefits of his and Maxwell's connections,\u201d court papers allege.\n\nMaxwell and Epstein allegedly warned Ransome that she wouldn\u2019t obtain her education or modeling contracts without performing sex acts with Epstein and others. The sex was required to avoid the group\u2019s \u201cthreatened retaliation against her if [she] did not perform as demanded,\u201d the lawsuit adds.\n\nRansome said she tried to swim off Epstein\u2019s private island after one alleged episode, where Epstein, Maxwell and Kellen ganged up on her with \u201cverbal abuse and threats.\u201d But a search party led by Epstein and Maxwell physically carried her back to his estate, she claims.\n\nThe trio is accused of keeping Ransome\u2019s passport so she couldn\u2019t escape. They had been providing Ransome with housing, a phone and transportation so long as she continued to \u201cservice Epstein sexually,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nIn January 2007, Epstein sent Ransome home to South Africa to recruit an aspiring model as his latest personal assistant. Ransome says she refused, realizing the new hire would \u201cbe forced into sexual servitude.\u201d But while she was abroad, Epstein and Maxwell warned Ransome she couldn\u2019t return to New York unless she lost weight, dropping from about 125 to 114 pounds, the lawsuit states.\n\nGroff would allegedly monitor her weight loss and dangle the prospect of an F.I.T. degree. Ransome \u201cattempted to comply with the order but, given her physical height and body structure and her already existing body weight, the diet imposed upon her placed her in serious physical jeopardy, including kidney malfunction and extreme emotional and psychological distress,\u201d the complaint says.\n\n\u201c At a sex offender registration hearing in 2011, a Manhattan assistant prosecutor asked a judge to go easy on Epstein by making him a Level 1 fiend. \u201d\n\nAccording to Ransome, Epstein and Maxwell even phoned Ransome\u2019s parents in South Africa to assure they\u2019d take care of their daughter when she returned to the U.S.\u2014and that they\u2019d use their connections to get her into school.\n\nRansome completed and delivered her F.I.T. application and supporting essay to Epstein, believing they were a \u201cdone deal,\u201d court papers allege. When she returned to New York in February 2007, Maxwell allegedly ordered her to have sex with Epstein immediately. She claims the alleged traffickers kept pressing her to drop excessive amounts of weight and \u201coffered her no opportunity to decline or resist their instructions.\u201d\n\nThree months later, Ransome says, she left the United States to flee Epstein.\n\nAll defendants (excluding Malyshev, who hasn\u2019t responded to the suit) say Ransome\u2019s claim for damages falls outside the statute of limitations for sex-trafficking victims\u2014and that the relationship with Epstein was \u201cconsensual\u201d in the first place.\n\nIn a motion to dismiss filed in November, lawyers for Epstein and Groff accuse Ransome of suing for sex-trafficking violations in \u201ca moment of stunning opportunism\u2026 allegedly because Epstein did not help [Ransome] to gain admission to the Fashion Institute of Technology and advance her career.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s camp, too, delivered a blistering rebuttal: \u201cRather than a Dickensian tale of a vulnerable, na\u00efve, young women, forced into a life of slavery and sexual servitude, this case actually presents the end game of a sophisticated, ambitious woman, accustomed to an expensive lifestyle provided by numerous male benefactors.\u201d\n\nIn response, Ransome\u2019s lawyers argued Maxwell \u201ccannot run away from the fact that [the complaint] properly alleges that Maxwell was the mastermind behind convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking scheme.\u201d They say the socialite incorrectly argues the Trafficking Victims Protection Act doesn\u2019t apply to Ransome\u2019s case because she wasn\u2019t physically chained against her will; rather, traffickers are known to use psychological coercion to maintain control over their victims.\n\n\u201cThis is not and never will be a sex trafficking case,\u201d Maxwell\u2019s team retorted in court papers last month. \u201cIt is the story of a brief, consensual relationship between two adults occurring more than ten years ago.\u201d\n\nAllegations of Jeffrey Epstein exploiting young women in New York were surfacing well before Sarah Ransome\u2019s case.\n\nMaximilia Cordero claimed she was 16 when Epstein sexually abused her in 2000 and vowed to boost her modeling career in exchange for sexual favors. Seven years later, when Cordero filed a lawsuit against him, her attorney (and boyfriend) said she was unable to consent because she was underage\u2014and because she had a mental illness. Cordero\u2019s suit was dismissed after a judge ruled Cordero was not insane during her encounters with Epstein and thus she could not circumvent the statute of limitations. According to the court\u2019s decision, the only medical testimony came from a psychiatrist hired by the defense who said Cordero\u2019s condition was caused by substance abuse. Epstein, through both an attorney and a spokesman, denied the allegations.\n\nThen there was Virginia Roberts.\n\nThe 15-year-old girl was working a summer job at Mar-a-Lago when Ghislaine Maxwell allegedly recruited her for Epstein in 1998. The alleged madam invited Roberts, who now goes by her married name Giuffre, to make good money by learning massage therapy, according to a now-settled lawsuit Giuffre filed as Jane Doe No. 102.\n\nMaxwell has denied the allegations, calling them \u201centirely false\u201d in a statement released in 2011 after Giuffre spoke to British media.\n\nGiuffre\u2019s father, a maintenance manager at the Trump resort, was glad an older woman was offering his daughter this opportunity and dropped her off at Epstein\u2019s mansion, her lawsuit said. Like the other victims, Giuffre claims she was sexually abused during the massage session. She claims Maxwell told Giuffre she had \u201clots of potential\u201d and asked her to return the next day.\n\n\u201c Giuffre has claimed she spent four years as Epstein\u2019s sex slave and was pimped out to the wealth manager\u2019s rich and powerful friends. \u201d\n\nGiuffre has claimed she spent four years as Epstein\u2019s sex slave and was pimped out to the wealth manager\u2019s rich and powerful friends.\n\nNow, 20 years after she met Epstein, Giuffre may testify against him. The financier is facing a malicious prosecution lawsuit in Florida from Bradley Edwards, an attorney who says Epstein sued him in 2009 as punishment for representing the victims.\n\nEdwards declined to comment on the case. But when asked why cops never busted Epstein in New York, he said, \u201cNew York authorities are familiar with the allegations that have been made by Virginia against Jeffrey Epstein and have shown no interest in investigating or prosecuting him or anyone else in New York.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after meeting Epstein, Giuffre says she was flown to New York for \u201ctraining\u201d at his mansion. \u201cIt was basically every day and was like going to school. I also had to have sex with Epstein many times,\u201d Giuffre said in a 2015 affidavit. (The statement was submitted as part of a lawsuit two women filed against the U.S. Department of Justice, saying prosecutors violated their rights as crime victims by failing to warn them of Epstein\u2019s plea deal.)\n\nGiuffre allegedly lived as Epstein\u2019s teenage slave from 1999 through 2002, including at his home in New York. \u201cIn fact, my only purpose for Epstein, Maxwell and their friends was to be used for sex,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c New York authorities are familiar with the allegations that have been made... against Jeffrey Epstein and have shown no interest in investigating or prosecuting him or anyone else in New York. \u201d \u2014 Brad Edwards\n\nThose friends allegedly included Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew, who was pictured in a photograph\u2014taken at Maxwell\u2019s London townhouse\u2014with his arm around Giuffre\u2019s partially bare waist. Both the Trump-supporting academic and the royal have denied having sex with Giuffre, and in April 2015, a federal judge struck the allegations from the court record. \u201cAt this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,\u201d Judge Kenneth Marra ruled. \u201cThese unnecessary details shall be stricken.\u201d\n\nGiuffre claimed she was subjected to daily sexual abuse, including by Maxwell, whom she later sued for defamation in Manhattan federal court in 2015. Giuffre argued the socialite called her a liar after she detailed her allegations in court papers. The case settled last year, preventing Epstein from taking the stand in what was expected to be an explosive trial.\n\nIn her affidavit, Giuffre says she \u201cobserved Maxwell have sex with dozens of underage girls\u201d and take explicit photos of them. \u201cMaxwell had large amounts of child pornography that she personally made. Many times she made me sleep with other girls, some of whom were very young, for purposes of taking sexual pictures,\u201d Giuffre added.\n\nNow a married mother of three, Giuffre said she was forced to sleep with Dershowitz for the first time in Epstein\u2019s New York mansion, when she was 16 years old. She claimed she also had sex with Prince Andrew in New York when she was 17.\n\nShe claimed Jean Luc Brunel, a modeling mogul now suing Epstein for tarnishing his reputation and damaging his business, had sex with her multiple times when she was 16 to 19 years old. Giuffre said some of those encounters occurred in New York, and that Brunel supplied Epstein with European minors who aspired to walk the runway.\n\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel\u2019s girls, and everything that I have seen confirms this claim,\u201d Giuffre said in her affidavit, adding that she witnessed orgies with children in different cities and that Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s New York-based assistant Sarah Kellen participated in them.\n\nGiuffre was allegedly trafficked to politicians, powerful business executives and other acquaintances of Epstein. \u201cEpstein required me to describe the sexual events that I had with these men presumably so that he could potentially blackmail them,\u201d Giuffre said in her affidavit, adding, \u201cI am still very fearful of these men today.\u201d\n\n\u201c In her affidavit, Giuffre says she \u2018observed Maxwell have sex with dozens of underage girls\u2019 and take explicit photos of them. \u201d\n\nGiuffre fled Epstein\u2019s clutches when he agreed to fly her to Thailand for massage training, she claims. She met her future husband and never looked back.\n\n\u201cBecause of how often Epstein and others were having sex with young girls, and how much it was a centerpiece of their lives, I doubt they have just stopped,\u201d Giuffre said in the affidavit. \u201cIt also seems to me that, when I knew them, they believed that they were above the law\u2014too powerful to be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nJack Scarola, an attorney for Edwards, expects the trial in Palm Beach to start no later than August and that the court will likely set a date early next month.\n\nThe upcoming trial will be the first time that Jeffrey Epstein\u2014if he chooses to appear in court\u2014will be forced to \u201csit there and be confronted with the truth about what he has done,\u201d Scarola told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cHe has thus far been able to avoid that experience and been able to avoid a detailed airing in a public courtroom about what has gone on, as opposed to filings that are buried in the records of the clerk\u2019s office,\u201d Scarola said.\n\n\u201cVirginia is ready, willing, able and enthusiastic about the opportunity that she will have to confront Jeffrey Epstein face to face,\u201d Scarola added. \u201cThere are other victims who are absolutely ready and willing to testify.\u201d\n\nIncluded on the witness list are Prince Andrew, President Clinton, President Trump, David Copperfield and Leslie Wexner, the billionaire founder of the company that owns Victoria\u2019s Secret and Epstein\u2019s only known financial client. (Scarola said the boldfaced names are listed because they may have knowledge of the case, but that he doesn\u2019t expect most of them will be witnesses.)\n\n\u201c He has thus far, for reasons that remain unexplained, been able to evade criminal responsibility for his wrongdoing. \u201d \u2014 Jack Scarola\n\nThe proceeding may be in Florida, but Epstein\u2019s lifestyle and activities in all of his locations, including New York, are likely to come up.\n\n\u201cHe has thus far, for reasons that remain unexplained, been able to evade criminal responsibility for his wrongdoing,\u201d Scarola said. \u201cIt may very well be that the focus of public attention through this civil lawsuit on what he has done will create the kind of pressure necessary to see that he is appropriately criminally prosecuted.\u201d\n\nIf the recently released FBI memos on Epstein are any indication, the feds have known about Giuffre\u2019s claims for years. Among the press clippings included in the file were a Daily Mail story from March 2011, when Giuffre revealed her identity.\n\nSoon after Giuffre went public, according to her 2015 affidavit, two FBI agents met her in Australia, where she was living at the time. \u201cThey seemed to be very professional and hard working. I thought to myself, \u2018Wow, these people will do the right thing against the bad guys and protect me,\u2019\u201d Giuffre said.\n\nIn a second affidavit filed months later, Giuffre said the agents \u201cseemed like they were being blocked from doing what they wanted to do\u2014which I thought was to arrest Epstein and his powerful friends for all their illegal sex crimes.\u201d\n\nGiuffre hoped Epstein would be prosecuted. \u201cBut when nothing came of it, I got very upset,\u201d Giuffre said. \u201cI wanted to do something to stop Epstein and the other people he associates with from sexually abusing girls.\u201d She added, \u201cLaw enforcement had taken my detailed statements, but nothing seemed to be happening.\u201d\n\nGiuffre said she contacted the FBI in April 2014, months after she moved back to the United States. \u201cBut, it seemed like the hands of [assistant U.S. Attorney Marie] Villafa\u00f1a and the FBI were always tied by someone else with more authority,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have never been able to figure out who was (and still is) stopping a prosecution,\u201d Giuffre wrote in the affidavit.", "description": "Call him Weinstein 1.0: The billionaire with famous friends (Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen) was a secret pervert who used his power and influence to groom teens for abuse.", "authors": ["Kate Briquelet", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1557752247/180620-Briquelet-Jeffrey-Epstein-hero.jpg_ycxjci", "published_at": "2018-06-22"}
