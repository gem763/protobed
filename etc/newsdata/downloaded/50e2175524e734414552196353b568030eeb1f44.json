Kathleen Galligan, Detroit Free Press\n\nDETROIT \u2013 The United Automobile Workers's lead negotiator said talks with General Motors have \"taken a turn for the worse\" Sunday morning.\n\nIn a letter to union members around 11:30 a.m. Sunday, Terry Dittes, UAW vice president for the GM Department, said at 5:35 p.m. Saturday the UAW prepared an extensive package proposal and presented it to GM.\n\n\"Our proposal addressed issues of wages, signing bonus, job security, pensions, skilled trades, profit sharing, transfer rights; to name just a few,\" Dittes said.\n\nGM responded at 9:05 a.m. Sunday, Dittes said.\n\n\"The Company's response did not address our extensive package provided last evening,\" DIttes wrote. \"They reverted back to their last rejected proposal and made little change. The Company's response did nothing to advance a whole host of issues that are important to you and your families! It did nothing to provide job security during the term of this Agreement.\"\n\nGM-UAW strike: GM can withstand losses of UAW strike \u2013 because of what it stands to gain\n\nA UAW strike sign is held up by a case of water outside of Flint Engine Operations in Flint on Thursday, October 3, 2019.

These negotiations have taken a turn for the worse. Your issues are our issues, and our strength is with you, our great membership. We will continue to negotiate on behalf of you, your families and all workers in our country. \"\n\nGM had no comment on Dittes' letter or the status of negotiations.\n\nFollow Jamie L.
