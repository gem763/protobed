Leadership | Eni Aluko", "language": "en", "text": "Liverpool go to Manchester United on Sunday top of the table, nearly eight months since they last dropped a league point, and knowing that another victory could leave United as low as 17th by the end of the weekend. Based on performances this season it is hard to see how this United team can hurt J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, but perhaps the worst thing about the failure they are experiencing is that I believe they have no choice but to just live with it, for now at least.\n\nBy the end of his time in Manchester Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was making everybody miserable \u2013 his players, anyone forced to regularly watch them, and even himself. United were pretty much unbearable before he was sacked last December. But though the Portuguese is not widely associated with free-flowing football there is one thing he guarantees: trophies. In sacking him United effectively announced that some things \u2013 particularly a commitment to youth and attacking football \u2013 were more important to them than trophies.\n\nRalf Rangnick: \u2018I have to influence areas of development across the whole club\u2019 Read more\n\nTen months later they have a manager who puts his faith in youth and has certainly made the team less boring, but who doesn\u2019t look at all likely to be parading silverware any time soon. In football, you always have to be careful what you wish for: you can\u2019t abandon the single-minded pursuit of success only to change tack again a few months later because the alternative isn\u2019t successful enough. Some might think that sacking Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r would help United to move forward, but it wouldn\u2019t be real movement, just a series of kneejerk reactions.\n\nIf United now regret their decision to appoint Solskj\u00e6r, before they move to replace him they must examine why they went for him in the first place, find the faults in their methodology and try to deal with them. There is no point in leaping into another rash decision before they have corrected the issues that led to all the other rash decisions they took on their way to this point, and that led to them now considering another one.\n\nMourinho is criticised for being a three-year manager, but that is probably about the right lifespan for most coaches at top teams. Before any appointment is made those responsible have to know what they want the team to achieve over the following few years, and they must believe that their appointment is the right one to achieve those goals.\n\nWhen United first turned to Solskj\u00e6r it was as a short\u2011term fix who would be immediately welcomed by the fans, and he seemed to be a good choice for those limited ambitions. But even though he was initially successful, when they made his appointment permanent it was hard to see what they thought he could really be expected to achieve.\n\nWhen Liverpool appointed Klopp, on the other hand, his record and his personality made it reasonable to expect that he might win them a league title or a Champions League within a few years. What exactly did Solskj\u00e6r promise? If he had delivered more than a few more months of overachievement they would have been very lucky \u2013 and often their player recruitment has been just as shortsighted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018When United first turned to Solskj\u00e6r it was as a short-term fix who would be immediately welcomed by the fans.\u2019 Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters\n\nResearching a possible future career as a director of football, in the past few months I have spoken to a variety of people who hold that position, and a lot of them say one of the key things to building a team is being able to look three or four years in advance, both in player and managerial recruitment. It is their job to anticipate problems and have solutions prepared. What are the manager\u2019s weaknesses and how can they be addressed? What issues are there with the make-up of the squad, and which players could be brought in to deal with them? Increasingly it looks as if none of that analysis was done before United appointed Solskj\u00e6r. They found themselves on a great run of form, didn\u2019t have any better answers and took an easy nostalgic solution.\n\nAnd so here they are, approaching a home game against Liverpool, one of their great historic rivals, marooned in mid-table and seemingly with little hope of winning. Even through United\u2019s post-Ferguson slump Liverpool have struggled at Old Trafford \u2013 they have won only once in the last decade, and even that was long enough ago that Luis Su\u00e1rez was on the scoresheet. But at the moment this Liverpool side know only two ways of performing: either they play exceptionally well and blast teams away or they struggle but somehow grind out a win. Either way, they keep winning.\n\nWhen you compare the squads United don\u2019t so much suffer from a lack of quality \u2013 there are some excellent players there, even if Liverpool have much greater depth \u2013 as a lack of leadership. Klopp has leaders in every line: Virgil van Dijk in defence, James Milner and Jordan Henderson in midfield, and an attack that offers consistency and quality. And, of course, the manager has the full confidence of the club. United somehow, as a team, seem to lack character.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\n\nLiverpool look certain to challenge for trophies again, but before the Champions League triumph in June they had won a single League Cup in 13 years, and it will soon be 30 years since they last won the league. They have had to wait a long time for this, but that\u2019s football. United are still coming to terms with the departure of literally the greatest manager of all time, and though they may find a solution sooner perhaps it will take another 15 or 20 years before they are English champions again. It will not cheer them up much but for the neutral there is beauty in the long-term unpredictability of football, in the cycles of success and failure.\n\nJust like Liverpool, United will never get used to not winning, and their history will continue to fuel their ambition. But nostalgia is not always healthy, and if you spend too long looking to the past you risk losing control of your future. All that matters for United now is the present, the young manager in their dugout trying to rebuild, and the task of working out \u2013 better late than never \u2013 what needs to happen next.", "description": "United\u2019s shortsighted approach has left Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side lacking character \u2013 especially compared with Klopp\u2019s team", "authors": ["Eni Aluko"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd9edb2f6c4eef3e1c218f24c45853716ae7678/111_0_2971_1782/master/2971.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=06f140e4c85f47f04cde63acc41e870f", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
