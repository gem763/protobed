This falls to 13% for those in their 20s, rises to 16% for those in their 30s and reaches 25% for women and men in their 40s.\n\nMen and women reach their peak salaries in their 40s, said Rest Less, an advice site for the over-50s.\n\nStuart Lewis, founder of Rest Less, said: \"Our data shows that for women in their 50s, the chances of them earning an equal salary compared to their male peers is at its slimmest.\n\n\"Women in their 50s are facing an equality battle on multiple fronts in the workplace, firstly because of their gender and secondly because of their age.\n\n\"With such a tight labour market, and the wealth of talent and skills on offer amongst women in their 50s and 60s, it is surprising not to see more employers actively seeking out and engaging with this audience to help fill a very real skills gap.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nA separate study suggested that one in five people over the age of 50 took on supplementary work as well as their full-time job.\n\nExtra work included cleaning, accountancy, jobs in the gig economy such as driving, or letting out rooms in their house, said mobile business account firm ANNA Money.\n\nA Government Equalities Office spokeswoman said: \"These statistics demonstrate how women are likely sacrificing a larger pay packet, and career growth, because they are doing the bulk of childcare and unpaid work - like taking care of elderly relatives and their home.\n\n\"Equality at work has a huge benefit to business, the economy and society. We have invested in returners to work, and are working closely with businesses and employers across the country to ensure they close the gap.\"", "description": "Average salaries at that age for women end up being 28% \u2013 or \u00a312,509 \u2013 lower than men\u2019s", "authors": ["Press Association", "Oliver Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742556.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-699087151-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
