He is also expected to step down from WeWork's board.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported terms of the deal.\n\nMr Neumann was forced out as chief executive last month after WeWork's share offering ran into trouble, as investors questioned his leadership and the firm's mounting losses.\n\nThe company has grown from a single office in New York City to more than 500 locations around the world. But it lost about $900m in the first six months of this year.", "description": "The investment giant reportedly takes control of the firm, buying $1bn of shares from co-founder Adam Neumann.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15F66/production/_106785998_wepool.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
