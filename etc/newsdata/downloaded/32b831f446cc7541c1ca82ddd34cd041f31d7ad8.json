With clarity of thought like that, it's easy to see how the great man got his reputation.\n\nAt the time, such a desire was easier to state than to achieve, yet many pre-modern civilisations designed buildings to capture sunlight from the low-hanging winter sun, while maximising shade in the summer.\n\nAll very elegant but that's not the sort of solar power that will run a modern industrial economy. And millennia went by without much progress.\n\nA Golden Thread, a history of our relationship with the sun published in 1980, celebrates clever uses of solar architecture and technology across the centuries, and urged modern economies wracked by the oil shocks of the 1970s to learn from the wisdom of the ancients.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Buildings in Santorini, Greece, are traditionally painted white to reflect the Sun's rays\n\nFor example, parabolic mirrors - used in China 3,000 years ago - could focus the Sun's rays to grill meat.\n\nSolar thermal systems used winter sun to warm air or water that could reduce heating bills.\n\nSuch systems now meet about 1% of global energy demand for heating. It's better than nothing, but hardly a solar revolution.\n\nA Golden Thread only briefly mentions what was, in 1980, a niche technology: the solar photovoltaic (PV) cell, which uses sunlight to generate electricity.\n\nThe photovoltaic effect isn't new. It was discovered in 1839 by French scientist Edmond Becquerel, when he was just 19.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Becquerel first observed the photovoltaic effect in his father's laboratory\n\nIn 1883, American engineer Charles Fritts built the first solid-state photovoltaic cells, and then the first rooftop solar array which combined different cells, in New York city.\n\nThese early cells - made from a costly element named selenium - were expensive and inefficient.\n\nThe physicists of the day had no real idea how they worked - that required the insight of a fellow named Albert Einstein in 1905.\n\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\n\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Unlike selenium, silicon is cheap - and Bell Labs' researchers reckoned it was also 15 times more efficient.\n\nThese new silicon PV cells were great for satellites - the American satellite Vanguard 1 was the first to use them, carrying six solar panels into orbit in 1958.\n\nImage copyright NASA\n\nThe Sun always shines in space, and what else are you going to use to power a multimillion-dollar satellite, anyway? Yet solar PV had few heavy-duty applications on Earth itself: it was still far too costly.\n\nVanguard 1's solar panels produced half a watt at a cost of countless thousands of dollars.\n\nBy the mid-1970s solar panels were down to $100 (\u00a381) a watt - but that still meant $10,000 for enough panels to power a light bulb. Yet the cost kept dropping.\n\nBy 2016 it was 50 cents a watt and still falling fast. After millennia of slow progress, things have accelerated very suddenly.\n\nPerhaps we should have seen this acceleration coming.\n\nMore things that made the modern economy:\n\nIn the 1930s, an American aeronautical engineer named TP Wright carefully observed aeroplane factories at work.\n\nHe published research demonstrating that the more often a particular type of aeroplane was assembled, the quicker and cheaper the next unit became.\n\nWorkers would gain experience, specialised tools would be developed, and ways to save time and material would be discovered.\n\nWright reckoned that every time accumulated production doubled, unit costs would fall by 15%. He called this phenomenon \"the learning curve\".\n\nRecently, a group of economists and mathematicians at Oxford University found convincing evidence of learning-curve effects across more than 50 different products from transistors to beer - including photovoltaic cells.\n\nSometimes the learning curve is shallow and sometimes it is steep, but it always seems to be there.\n\nIn the case of PV cells, it's quite steep: for every doubling of output, cost falls by over 20%.\n\nAnd this matters because output is increasing so fast: between 2010 and 2016 the world produced 100 times more solar cells than it had before 2010.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The power plant in La Colle des Mees, Alpes de Haute Provence, France, has 112,000 solar panels across 200 hectares\n\nBatteries - an important parallel technology for solar PV - are also marching along a steep learning curve.\n\nThe learning curve creates a feedback loop that makes it harder to predict technological change. Popular products become cheap and cheaper products become popular.\n\nAnd any new product needs somehow to get through the expensive early stages. Solar PV cells needed to be heavily subsidised at first - as they were in Germany for environmental reasons.\n\nMore recently China seems to have been willing to manufacture large quantities in order to master the technology.\n\nThis led the administration of previous US President Obama to complain that, rather than being too expensive, imported solar panels had become unfairly cheap.\n\nSolar panels are particularly promising in poorer countries with underdeveloped and unreliable energy grids and plenty of sunshine during the day.\n\nWhen Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, for example, he announced ambitious plans to build large utility-scale solar farms - but also to establish tiny grids in rural villages with little or no access to the main grid.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Indian government says the country receives more than enough solar radiation to meet its annual energy needs\n\nBut now that solar PV has marched along the learning curve, it is competitive even in rich, well-connected areas.\n\nAs early as 2012, PV projects in the sunny US states were signing deals to sell power at less than the price of electricity generated by fossil fuels.\n\nThat was the sign that solar power had become a serious threat to existing fossil fuel infrastructure, not because it's green but because it's cheap.\n\nIn late 2016 in Nevada, for example, several large casino chains switched from the state utility to purchase their power from largely renewable sources.\n\nThis wasn't a corporate branding exercise: it was designed to save them money, even after paying $150m (\u00a3122m) as a severance fee.\n\nThe Sun does not shine at night, and winter storage remains a big challenge. As Socrates warned us: the wisest people understand that they know nothing.\n\nBut the learning curve tells us that the ultimate triumph of solar PV seems likely: it is getting cheaper as it gets more popular, and more popular as it gets cheaper.\n\nSocrates notwithstanding, that sounds like a recipe for success.\n\nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.
