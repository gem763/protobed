The families also learn about farming and production and the impact of meat consumption on the environment and their own health.\n\n\"Could you go back to meat once you've put a name and a face to a meal?\" the show asks.\n\nInside the labs crafting slaughter-free meat\n\nIts makers tout the show as a \"life-changing, emotional experiment\" that raises awareness around the consequences of meat eating and animal welfare.\n\nThe meatless movement has gained momentum as experts shine a light on the environmental toll of meat consumption. A 2019 United Nations report found that agriculture, forestry and other land uses produce nearly half of the world's methane emissions \u2014 a greenhouse gas that also comes from cows. Eating more plant-based foods can conserve land that would otherwise be used to graze animals and mitigate climate change, some experts think.\n\nA Nielsen survey shows that 39% of Americans are trying to eat more plant-based foods.\n\nMark Ogle, a spokesman for the series, produced by Britain's Spun Gold TV and commissioned by the U.K.'s Channel 4, wouldn't offer clues about the choices participants made after getting up close and personal with animals they ordinarily eat. But he told CBS MoneyWatch that \"it's fair to say all the families learned a lot more about the meat processing industry and food chain, which made them all think about their eating and purchasing habits.\"", "description": "British program challenges meat eaters to live with animals \u2014 and kill them if they decide to stay carnivores", "authors": ["Megan Cerullo"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/07/a664a606-3e1e-457d-bb02-15e1e8e480e9/thumbnail/1200x630/5654541113af8b2fdde7d86219c2ba9b/pig.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
