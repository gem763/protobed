Many years ago, Leah and I were both privileged to have been exposed to SK Matseke, the pioneering teacher and principal, who taught Leah and loaned me textbooks for my first degree,\" said Desmond.\n\nHe said it was wonderful that Kjellstr\u00f6m-Matseke returned to South Africa and had now agreed to lead the foundation.\n\n\"What an honour and a pleasure for us oldies to know that there are young people of the highest calibre advancing our foundation and taking on some of our work,\" he added.\n\n\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
