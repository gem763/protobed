Another whistleblower is known to have come forward.\n\nCongressional investigators are currently vetting the new accounts they\u2019ve received for credibility. Accordingly, knowledgeable sources would not discuss where in the government these new would-be whistleblowers come from, nor what they purport to have to say.\n\nIt\u2019s also unknown if their accounts are as significant as that of the intelligence whistleblower whose alarm over President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call sparked the impeachment probe. Investigators often encounter cranks as well as those with genuine knowledge of wrongdoing. Nor is it clear if these new ostensible whistleblowers have contacted any inspectors general, as the original two whistleblowers did.\n\n\u201cThere are clearly numerous whistleblowers out there and many people who possess firsthand relevant information who could come forward, and I expect some will,\u201d said attorney Mark Zaid, who represents those two whistleblowers (and also represents The Daily Beast in freedom-of-information lawsuits).\n\nOne knowledgeable source said that the daily accumulation of revelations about Trump\u2019s willingness to use U.S. foreign relations for his personal political benefit has prompted more people to approach Congress. Two associates of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani have been arrested and charged with campaign-finance violations arising from their Ukraine dirt-digging effort. The Financial Times reported that Trump China adviser Michael Pillsbury said he received \u201cquite a bit of background\u201d on Joe Biden\u2019s son after Trump publicly called for China to aid his domestic political prospects. The Washington Post reported that Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, and Trump attempted to quash a prosecution of a Turkish national\u2014represented by Giuliani and important to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2014for violating Iran sanctions.\n\nInvestigators are using the soon-to-expire congressional recess to vet the accounts they\u2019re getting.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who chairs the House Intelligence committee, a locus of the impeachment probe, told The Daily Beast this month that he did not want to comment on whether investigators had heard from additional whistleblowers. Schiff noted that his committee rarely acknowledges receiving whistleblower complaints because \u201cpeople can reverse-engineer who whistleblowers are\u201d given an abundance of identifying information.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say, and I don\u2019t want to suggest too much by this, is we began discussions with other committees investigating these issues, when the first news started breaking about Giuliani seeking foreign help in Ukraine to aid the president\u2019s campaign,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nThe revelations come while Congress interviews the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine the administration removed, Maria Yovanovitch, despite the White House\u2019s announced refusal to cooperate with the House Democratic inquiry. Other cracks in that front have emerged. On Friday, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union implicated in the Ukraine pressure campaign, announced through his lawyers that he will defy State Department instructions against talking to Congress.", "description": "The first two officials who came forward about the president\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine seem to be just the beginning, according to Hill sources.", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Sam Brodey", "Sam Stein", "Senior Nat L Security Correspondent", "Congressional Reporter", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570810068/191011-Brodey-Congress-tease_qvhciz", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
