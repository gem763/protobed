Powell. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nJerome H. Powell is facing a wave of criticism about his leadership of the Federal Reserve as he attempts to steer the central bank, and the U.S. economy, through a perilous moment.\n\nEconomists and market players \u2014 including some former Fed officials \u2014 say he\u2019s been an ineffective communicator and failed to develop a larger strategy for monetary policy.\n\nHis approach, critics say, has left investors and business leaders confused about the central bank\u2019s path forward at a moment when uncertainty from the trade war and a global slowdown is already clouding their outlook. And Powell has little room for error, considering the unprecedented assault on his performance he is absorbing from President Trump.\n\n\u201cHe has struggled to formulate very basic things central bankers should be able to answer, and he hasn\u2019t shown a clear analytical framework,\u201d Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein and a former staffer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told my colleague Heather Long for a piece we wrote on Powell\u2019s on-the-job evolution.\n\nPowell is attempting to prove he\u2019s learned during his 20 months on the job and will be a steadying hand by showing more of his prep work during post-Fed meeting news conferences. That\u2019s meant pivoting from a loose, conversational style during those appearances to a more deliberate if less engaging one.\n\nA top economist at a major Wall Street bank put it to me this way: \u201cWhen Powell first started, everybody said his style was so refreshing, because he's so plain spoken. It got me to thinking: Maybe there's a reason why central bankers aren't so plain spoken\u2026 [At his Sept. 18 news conference] I thought he was more central banker-like, with a more judicious choice of words. I like him as a person and sympathize with the situation he\u2019s in. But there\u2019s room for improvement, and I\u2019m not the only one who thinks that.\u201d\n\nThen-Fed Chair Janet Yellen arrives for a news conference in 2014. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nNow, like Janet Yellen before him, he\u2019s reading more of his answers directly from a binder of likely questions and canned answers he brings with him. From our story: \u201cIn early 2019, Powell started putting several dozen colored tabs into the binder he personally assembles for news conferences so he can quickly flip to answers on about any topic. Since the spring, he has brought this enhanced binder along and looked down more often.\u201d\n\nPowell got generally positive marks for hewing to that approach in his most recent news conference. Those reviews marked a major improvement over his July 31 appearance, during which he confounded Wall Street traders by referring to the Fed\u2019s first interest rate cut since the recession as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment.\u201d\n\n\u201cMid-cycle adjustment \u2014 what does that mean? I have no idea,\u201d Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed from 2006 to 2015, told Heather. \u201cI was on the inside at the Fed for almost 10 years and even I find it confusing.\u201d\n\nSarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor and deputy secretary of the Treasury, summed up the case in defense of Powell as a figure in an exceedingly difficult position: \u201cEvery Fed Chair thinks he or she will hold the gold medal for superb communication. But here\u2019s the reality: It is downright difficult to be perfect, especially in the age of regular press conferences,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cMonetary policy concepts are not particularly accessible, and sometimes market players don\u2019t like what the Fed is deciding. As for Jay Powell, he has an additional and monumental challenge given the constant drumbeat of harassment coming from Mr. Trump, attempting to undermine him and pump up others. Chairman Powell is doing a fine job keeping the Fed from becoming a show to audition for and rate.\u201d\n\nPowell isn\u2019t the only top Fed official weathering criticism. New York Fed President John Williams is facing a trial of his own, as financiers question his handling of recent kinks in the repo market. They forced the bank to pump tens of billions of dollars into the system to keep it liquid \u2014 and prevent effective interest rates from creeping up.\n\nPowell and New York Fed president John Williams walk together in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this summer. (Reuters/Ann Saphir)\n\n\u201cThe situation is the biggest test so far for Mr. Williams \u2014 who took the helm of the New York Fed in June 2018 \u2014 and one that many market analysts say deserves a less-than-stellar grade,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Jeanna Smialek writes. \u201cWhile officials have succeeded in getting interest rates under control, some investors have criticized the Fed for moving too hesitantly when problems first arose, waiting until rates on repurchase, or repo, agreements had skyrocketed and briefly spilled over, pushing the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate above its intended range.\u201d\n\nThe repo market turbulence follows a staff shakeup Williams ordered \u2014 ousting Simon Potter and Richard Dzina, two top officials at the bank \u2014 \u201cbecause of differences in management style,\u201d Smialek writes. \u201cTheir dismissal unsettled some bank employees and raised eyebrows on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nPowell isn\u2019t responsible for the static at the New York Fed, but some market watchers say the headlines have added to the sense that central bankers in his era are letting events slip out of control.\n\n\u201cPeople gave [Ben] Bernanke and Yellen the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings. \u201cI don\u2019t think people give Powell the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

AP's Stan Choe and Damian Troise: \"U.S. stocks climbed on Monday and gave one last nudge to ensure the S&P 500 emerged from yet another tumultuous quarter with a modest gain. As has been the case throughout the quarter, movements in [Trump\u2019s] trade war with China helped drive the market on Monday.\n\n\"Investors found encouragement after China said that its top trade negotiator will lead talks with the United States that are expected to take place next week. The Trump administration also calmed some worries that it may limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies... The S&P 500 climbed 14.95 points, or 0.5%, to 2,976.74.\"\n\n\u2014 Fed study: Robots are hurting worker wages. Bloomberg's Simon Kennedy: \"Automation has 'contributed substantially' to reducing the portion of national income that goes to U.S. workers over the past two decades, according to a new study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Despite the lowest unemployment rate in around 50 years, the so-called labor share has fallen to about 56% from 63% in 2000 and the increased use of robots and other technology has been an important driving factor, the economists Sylvain Leduc and Zheng Liu wrote in the report published on Monday...\n\n\"The upshot is that workers become more reluctant to ask for significant pay hikes out of fear that their employer will turn to automation to replace them, the economists said. That potentially explains why wage growth has been relatively weak despite the tightening labor market.\"\n\nMidwest\u2019s Faltering Economies Will Spread Pain Nationwide Regional economic indicators suggest that the financial health of the Midwest is waning, as trade tariffs start to take their toll on sectors from farming to manufacturing.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nMcConnell wants trade war to end soon: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNBC \"that the China trade war has been 'very tough' on farmers in the United States,\" CNBC's Kevin Stankiewicz reports.\n\nThe majority leader was touting the USMCA: McConnell made the appearance on the heels of a Wall Street Journal op-ed he co-wrote with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pushing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats to pass Trump's NAFTA 2.0 deal. The Kentucky Republican said the trade deal \"ought to be at the top of the list\" for the House and that failing to pass it would leave Pelosi heading into 2020 \"having it credibly said that all you did for the whole Congress was harass the president and tried to have him removed from office.\u201d\n\nMore on the trade war with China: \"The Chinese have been stealing our intellectual property and not playing by the rules for a long time,\" he said. \"I admire what he is trying to do, but I hope we can get a conclusion to this soon because rural America really needs it, and rural America also needs the USMCA.\"\n\n\"The Chinese have been stealing our intellectual property and not playing by the rules for a long time,\" he said. \"I admire what he is trying to do, but I hope we can get a conclusion to this soon because rural America really needs it, and rural America also needs the USMCA.\" On the balance of doing business with companies like Huawei: \"We don\u2019t want actually \u2013 obviously, to make it more difficult for American companies to do business in China and for Chinese companies to do business here,\" he said. \"But these national security implications are important. Huawei was right in the cross-hairs of what we\u2019re talking about here, that\u2019s a good example.\"\n\n\u2014 China warns of market instability if companies are delisted: China warned \u201cof instability in international markets from any \u2018decoupling,\u2019 of China and the United States, after sources said the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges,\u201d Michael Martina of Reuters reports.\n\n\u201cThe move would be part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters last week, in what would be a radical escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions. \u2026 White House trade adviser Peter Navarro \u2026 dismissed the reports as \u2018fake news.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PayPal is set to enter the Chinese market: \u201cU.S. digital money transfer platform PayPal Holdings Inc. has obtained Beijing\u2019s approval to buy a controlling stake in a domestic payments firm, which would make PayPal the first foreign firm to enter China\u2019s payment services market,\u201d Meg Shen of Reuters reports.\n\n\u201cGopay Information Technology, PayPal\u2019s acquisition target, has received approval from China\u2019s central bank to sell a 70% stake to PayPal, both companies said.\u201d\n\nAnd Beijing is fighting to keep private companies afloat: \u201cChina is snapping up stakes in private companies at a record rate, as the trade war, economic slowdown and credit squeeze heap pressure on entrepreneurs,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shen Hong reports.\n\n\u201cThe investments mark a reversal after decades in which state-owned enterprises have shrunk in importance, as reflected in measures such as their share of the workforce or asset ownership. Since China\u2019s public-sector companies are typically less efficient or innovative than their private rivals, the shopping spree could lead to a fresh drag on growth.\u201d\n\n\u2014 S&P Global: Trade war could hit U.S. growth. The firm is forecasting domestic growth wil slide to 2.3 percent this year, a downward revision of its previous call of 2.5 percent, and 1.7 percent next year, down from1.8 percent, as a result of drags from the trade war. \"Consumer spending and the U.S. labor and housing market are strong,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, S&P's chief U.S. economist. \"But the trade war, coupled with waning fiscal stimulus and slowing global growth, suggest that the domestic signs of strength may not be enough.\"\n\nGlobal Trade Set for Weakest Year Since Crisis Global trade flows are set to increase at the weakest pace this year since the global financial crisis as tariffs rise and the world economy cools, according to the WTO.

The Post's Jeff Stein: \"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled a plan on Monday that would dramatically increase taxes on corporations that pay their CEOs far more than their workers, adding to the growing suite of policy proposals to expand taxes in the Democratic presidential race.\n\n\"Under Sanders\u2019s plan, the government would increase a firm\u2019s corporate tax rate if its highest-paid employee earns more than 50 times what its average worker does \u2014 an attempt to encourage companies to distribute their profits more equitably.
