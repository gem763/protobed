And they launched an effort to start a union, as the conversation snowballed to include issues like pay disparities and sexual harassment. But that effort has been marked by tension \u2014 the company fired two of the union\u2019s main organizers within a week of each other in September.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWaves of employee activism have swept through the world of tech in the past couple of years, but these actions \u2014 protests, petitions, walkouts \u2014 have largely stopped short of union campaigns. Kickstarter would be the first name-brand tech shop to unionize , potentially foreshadowing the growth of organized labor in previously inhospitable terrain.\n\nIs Kickstarter a sign of unions\u2019 renewed appeal among a new generation of workers? In 1983, 20.1 percent of American workers were in labor unions. Now, just 10.5 percent are. The campaign\u2019s outcome is likely to be interpreted as a harbinger \u2014 even if it\u2019s just an attempt by a handful of workers to shake things up during rocky times at one company.\n\nPunching Nazis\n\nKickstarter has been a darling of the New York City tech scene since it was founded in 2009, lauded for creating a sleek platform to crowdfund artistic projects and inventions of all stripes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut internal struggles have spilled into view in recent years. Employees told The Washington Post that the \u201cAlways Punch Nazis\u201d incident, in August last year, marked a new low. (The Post spoke to about a dozen current and former Kickstarter employees for this report.)\n\nManagers had explained the decision to take the project down to staffers in a meeting at the company\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters. But employees pushed back, including at least one who questioned whether he could still continue his work there.\n\n\u201cThere is a set of rules in life and one big rule that says don\u2019t help Nazis,\u201d said Taylor Moore, a former employee and union organizer at the company. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Kickstarter to just be one of these companies that folded for these slugs.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe swell of emotion surprised some who were there that day, and a manager made the decision to leave the project up, against the legal counsel\u2019s advice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a great moment \u2014 we were like, \u2018Hey, we did this,\u2019 \u201d said Clarissa Redwine, 29, an employee at the company at the time. \u201cWe came together and helped influence a decision that was made.\u201d\n\nThe project ended up raising $5,000, surpassing its goal.\n\nToday seems like the right day to share this, via @kickstarter. https://t.co/gJkAsYXF5Q \u2014 Ron Marz (@ronmarz) August 11, 2018\n\nTalk of forming a union began to percolate even though none of the organizers had that much experience with one, Moore said.\n\nSo the group contacted veteran organizers and consulted with a guy who had \u201csalted\u201d \u2014 union slang for getting a job somewhere with the intent to organize fellow workers \u2014 the Atlantic City casinos. They also began to talk to co-workers about workplace concerns.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou discover it\u2019s not just the neo-Nazis and unjust termination,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s also some women saying there\u2019s a gender pay disparity, someone saying they\u2019ve had their sexual harassment claims ignored, another saying that working remotely is not fairly applied on their team. It really became clear that a union was not only a good idea but necessary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKickstarter spokesman David Gallagher told The Post that leadership sat down with members of the Trust and Safety team after the comic-book debate but that nobody was fired or threatened.\n\nA tech movement\n\nThe halo of optimism that had surrounded the tech world\u2019s public image took a beating after the 2016 election. The bitter campaign was marked by a growing awareness of the harassment, racism and misinformation that was flourishing on platforms built by some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most vaunted companies.\n\nAD\n\nThat phenomenon, in combination with the rise of a fired-up left wing in President Trump\u2019s time in office, has created a potent mix for tech companies.\n\nAt Google, employees have challenged work with the Defense Department and China and staged massive walkouts over sexual misconduct policies. At Microsoft and Salesforce, workers protested contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. At Amazon, shareholder groups contested the development of a facial-identification program being used by law enforcement agencies. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe efforts are drawing inspiration from one another, as well as from worker movements such as the West Virginia teacher strike and the Fight for $15. But despite considerable buzz, unions \u2014 which have been on the wane for decades \u2014 have not broken through in tech\u2019s white-collar workforce, which typically enjoys high pay, comfortable benefits and plentiful perks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKickstarter, with a staff of about 160, could change that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d said Mar Hicks, a tech historian at the Illinois Institute of Technology. \u201cIt kind of shows which way the wind is blowing. Even at a company like Kickstarter where you see they\u2019re not doing anything particularly controversial, like picking up contracts from the Pentagon, employees have shown there is a very good reason to have more power.\u201d\n\nWorkplace drama\n\nOrganizers said the Kickstarter union would increase accountability around decisions about pay, hiring and discipline.\n\nBut the push seemed to accentuate divisions in the building \u2014 among staffers, and between staffers and management, current and former employees told The Post.\n\nAD\n\nThe same day the union effort was made public in mid-March, Chen, the company\u2019s CEO, announced he was stepping down. The next day, three employees sent a memo to the whole staff that outlined their concerns about the union.\n\nAD\n\nManagement at the company began to talk to the staff about the effort, according to Redwine. They implemented some staff demands, improving the company\u2019s financial transparency and creating an anonymous tool to report work issues.\n\nThey also brought in an outside lawyer \u2014 known for representing companies in disputes with unions \u2014 to train managers, and held three attendance-optional meetings with staffers in May and June to talk about the union campaign.\n\nAD\n\nBy then, the company\u2019s new CEO, Aziz Hasan, had told the staff in an email that leadership did not support the union effort and would not voluntarily recognize it.\n\nRedwine said she interpreted the statements and meetings as \u201cclassic union-busting tactics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would read prepared statements that were very anti-union in the guise of having Q and A,\u201d Redwine said. \u201cThey brought in anti-union lawyers, sent around emails saying they did not think a union was right for Kickstarter.\u201d\n\nTwo employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared harassment, told The Post that organizers\u2019 aggressive tactics had felt like harassment to some workers at the office. They also questioned whether the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), the national organization Kickstarter United had chosen to affiliate with, had the staff\u2019s best interests at heart.\n\nThree organizers dismissed\n\nRedwine, who had been a public member of the union\u2019s organizing committee, said that she began to feel as if she was a target of hostility from her managers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have a normal conversation in Slack then all of a sudden get a long email about how my conversation was disrespectful and inappropriate,\u201d she said. \u201cI would push back and then be told I couldn\u2019t take feedback. I was in this trap.\u201d\n\nShe said she was told during a review in July that she was having problems \u201cbeing a team player\u201d and building trust with managers.\n\nShe said she was fired in early September after her bosses said she had been disrespectful during a conversation with another employee. She had worked there for four years and said that her performance and metrics at the company had always been exemplary.\n\nOne week later, around Sept. 12, Moore was also fired. He was also one of the five or six people who had been regularly listed on Kickstarter United emails as an organizer. He had worked at the company for six years.\n\nAD\n\nOver 180 @kickstarter creators, who have collectively raised 7+ million dollars, have now signed our statement of solidarity with the Kickstarter Union and condemned the company's firing of organizers. I would like to share some of their comments with you. https://t.co/AiQObPxt3J \u2014 Nathan J Robinson (@NathanJRobinson) September 18, 2019\n\nPostscript\n\nA lawyer for the OPEIU filed a formal complaint with the NLRB on Sept. 16, days after the firings.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the company violated two sections of federal labor law by firing Redwine and Moore because of involvement in the union.\n\nKickstarter said it has not dismissed or retaliated against anyone for union organizing, saying the two employees were let go for \u201cperformance reasons,\u201d without giving specifics.\n\n\u201cWe have affirmed the staff\u2019s right to organize, and six months after the organizing effort here was announced, the decision remains in their hands,\u201d Gallagher, the company spokesman, said in an email. \u201cBoth of these employees were members of the organizing committee, but this had nothing to do with their departures.\u201d\n\nKickstarter United declined to answer questions about the progress of its organizing effort. Two union members told The Post that the firings have galvanized its push.\n\nIf the union does not win recognition from the company voluntarily, it can win the right to bargain collectively in an election overseen by the NLRB. But it will need to show that at least 30 percent of union-eligible employees support the effort first, and win a majority of the election ballots.\n\nMoore, for one, is bullish on its prospects. He sees Kickstarter\u2019s union as part of the larger movement.\n\n\u201cThe tech industry as a whole is maturing in a way that means these internal anxieties aren\u2019t going to be resolved unless unions happen,\u201d he said.", "description": "The organizing began with a comic book.
