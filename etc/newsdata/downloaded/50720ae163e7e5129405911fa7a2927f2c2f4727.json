Legally, the judges said, it had never been prorogued.\n\nAnnouncing the verdict, Supreme Court president Lady Hale said: \"The court is bound to conclude that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d\n\nShe said the \"prolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstance\", citing the upcoming Brexit deadline on 31 October.\n\nShe added: \"The effect on the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme\".\n\nResponding to the ruling immediately, House of Commons speaker John Bercow said: \"I welcome the Supreme Court\u2019s judgement that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful.\n\n\"The judges have rejected the government\u2019s claim that closing down parliament for five weeks was merely standard practice to allow for a new Queen\u2019s Speech. I\n\n\"In reaching their conclusion, they have vindicated the right and duty of parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinise the executive and hold ministers to account. As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nMore follows\u2026\n\n\n\n", "description": "Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament earlier this month was unlawful, the Supreme Court has ruled.In a unanimous verdict, the judges said the prorogation was \"unlawful, void and to no effect\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/frGZy5SuU3w97tEEraRnPg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/73d8aebb6e8eb62fbd58bdb39ea760cc", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
