He returns to the role in the Netflix movie \"El Camino,\" out Friday. (Oct. 9) AP, AP\n\nSpoiler alert! Contains details about Netflix's \"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,\" now streaming.\n\nIt wouldn't be \"Breaking Bad\" without some exuberant expletives from Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).\n\nIn the final 15 minutes of \"El Camino,\" Netflix's movie sequel to the AMC series (now streaming), Jesse appears in a flashback at a diner with Walter White (Bryan Cranston), his former high-school chemistry teacher and drug-dealing associate.\n\nHovering by the salad bar, Jesse piles his plate high with pineapple, croutons and a single cherry tomato, before letting out a satisfied, \"Yeah, b----!\"\n\nMore: 'El Camino': 'Breaking Bad' creator explains how that major character returned\n\nIt's an endearing, laugh-out-loud moment for any \"Bad\" fan, given Jesse's affinity for the catchphrase throughout the show's five-season run that ended in 2013. (According to one observant viewer, Jesse says the word \"b----\" 54 times during the series, compiled in a YouTube mashup.)\n\nPaul tells USA TODAY that it was his idea to include the iconic line in \"El Camino.\"\n\n\"That was actually the one 'b----' that I improvised in the history of Jesse Pinkman,\" Paul says with a laugh. \"After I read the script for the first time, I was on my way home and thought to myself, 'Wait, he doesn't say 'b----' in this movie. That's so funny.' I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I just decided to add it in there and they kept it in.\"\n\nJesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) is on the run in Netflix's two-hour \"El Camino,\" a movie sequel that picks up just after the events of AMC drama \"Breaking Bad.\" (Photo: Ben Rothstein / Netflix)\n\nJesse's diner flashback to a Season 2 episode comes at a crossroads for the character in \"El Camino,\" as he prepares to enact murderous revenge on a white supremacist group that imprisoned, tortured and forced him to cook meth in the final season. Over lunch, Walt encourages Jesse to get a college degree, and tells him it's not too late to put his life back on track.\n\n\"It was during happier times in these characters' lives,\" Paul says. \"Well, as happy as it could be: Walt was dying of lung cancer, so he had that looming darkness ahead. But it was before their lives were turned upside down, so it was nice to play him in his lighter days.\"\n\nMore: Aaron Paul on making the top-secret 'Breaking Bad' movie: 'It felt like a 'Star Wars' set'\n\nAfter Jesse kills his ex-captors and flees to Alaska to start fresh, \"El Camino\" ends with another stirring flashback: this time, to Jesse and his soon-to-be-late girlfriend, Jane (Krysten Ritter), as they debate whether life is best left to chance.\n\n\"I've gone where the universe takes me my whole life,\" Jane tells Jesse. \"It's better to make those decisions for yourself.\"\n\nKrysten Ritter at the Los Angeles premiere of \"El Camino\" last week.

Paul also sees it as a sunset for the character, adding that he and \"Bad\" creator Vince Gilligan have no plans to make another Jesse-centric film.\n\n\"I thought I'd said goodbye to this guy years ago, but this is a really nice way to end his story,\" Paul says. Once Jesse reaches Alaska, \"I think he'll be on the straight and narrow. He knows he's lucky to be alive, so I think he's going to keep his nose clean and start a new life.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/14/breaking-bad-el-camino-aaron-paul-jesse-pinkman-ending-spoilers/3972394002/", "description": "Aaron Paul brought back Jesse Pinkman's beloved catchphrase for \"Breaking Bad\" movie sequel \"El Camino,\" which centers on the former meth cook.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "Published P.M.
