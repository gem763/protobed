I think everyone will look at that and think, this isn\u2019t the time for more games in parliament, more amendments, more procedural tricks, which are just covers for trying to frustrate Brexit altogether.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier to BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme, Sunak said economic assessments were not needed: \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about when we talk about economic assessments is the future relationship, and that obviously is something that needs to be negotiated. Parliament will have its say on that process.\n\n\u201cBut I would say this: this is about restoring trust in politics, ending the division of the last three years. No impact assessment or spreadsheet could convey the value of doing that if we could support this deal.\u201d\n\nSunak said he would expect Bercow to grant a second vote: \u201cThe Speaker has always said that he would allow parliament to find a way to express an opinion on something. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that parliament does want to express an opinion on this incredibly important matter.\u201d\n\nBut Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said he would be surprised if Bercow allowed a fresh vote.\n\n\u201cThe government is trying to bring back a vote that was dealt with in the House of Commons on Saturday,\u201d he told Today. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how that is within the rules of the House of Commons, given on Saturday we amended that motion and that motion passed,\u201d\n\nAshworth, who said it was \u201cutterly irresponsible\u201d that MPs should be asked to approve a Brexit plan without even seeing the associated legislation, rejected the idea that a customs union amendment was an attempt to derail the process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not attempting to wreck it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re attempting to safeguard the British economy, to safeguard jobs and public services.\u201d\n\nJohnson was forced to send the EU a letter seeking another Brexit extension after his first attempt to push his deal through the Commons on Saturday was amended, although the EU will wait to see whether this will be needed.\n\nMinisters are hopeful that if Bercow was to allow another vote, Johnson might have a sufficiently large coalition of MPs for it to pass, with the help of some Labour rebels and the bulk of the strongly pro-Brexit wing of the Conservative party.\n\nSteve Baker, who chairs the Tory hardline Brexit supporting European Research Group, said he was committed to the deal \u2013 and said the DUP should do the same, despite the party\u2019s opposition to separate customs arrangements for Northern Ireland under Johnson\u2019s plan, something the PM had previously ruled out.\n\n\u201cThe point is that for people like me, vast areas of that withdrawal agreement are unchanged, and we are going to have to choke down our pride and vote in the national interests to get Brexit done, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid I am asking the DUP, just as we are having to choke down extremely difficult compromises to get out in the national interest, I think on this issue,\u201d he told Today.\n\n\u201cThis is a potentially a temporary arrangement, which will be superseded with a free trade agreement. I would ask the DUP to accept this compromise.\u201d", "description": "Treasury secretary calls on Speaker to grant government second Commons vote", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eeefa9224c5edec76653596d834a43e5fe9df6f/0_75_2266_1359/master/2266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a341a962950ebff1696a8188e4e5c49", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
