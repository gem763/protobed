Led by Max Rose (D-NY), the lawmakers asked why a \u201cviolent white supremacist\u201d group \u201cthat openly welcomes neo-Nazis into its ranks\u201d has still not been officially listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the US government.\n\nThey wrote that the shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand had ties with Azov and \u201croutinely wore a neo-Nazi symbol associated with them.\u201d The massacre, which left 51 people dead, directly inspired the recent mass shootings in Poway, California and El Paso, Texas, the lawmakers said, accusing Azov of \u201cradicalizing\u201d American citizens.\n\nThe link between Azov and acts of terror in America is clear.\n\nAzov quickly jumped to dismiss these claims as \u201cnothing more than an informational attack against Ukraine, its sovereignty and state security.\u201d The group also seized the opportunity to boast about being \u201cone of the most well-known and most capable Ukrainian units,\u201d and having earned respect at home and abroad for its \u201cglory in combat.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Ukraine's Nazis: Who are they, why are they so influential \u2014 and why have media ignored them?\n\nFormed shortly after a civil war broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014, the Azov Regiment is mostly comprised of far-right volunteers, many of whom openly express white nationalist and neo-Nazi beliefs. The unit\u2019s logo is the \u2018Wolfsangel\u2019 rune used by the German 2nd SS Panzer Division \u2018Das Reich\u2019 in WWII. Its members regularly participate in torchlight processions, honoring the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which fought alongside Hitler.\n\nAzov\u2019s commander Andriy Biletsky once said that Ukraine\u2019s historical mission is to lead \u201cthe white nations of the world into the last crusade\u201d against \u201cthe Semite Untermenschen.\u201d Biletsky has toned down his nationalistic rhetoric in recent years and denies that his regiment has any ties to anti-Semitism.\n\nAlso on rt.com US soldier arrested for plot to bomb news network planned to fight with Azov Battalion in Ukraine\n\nThe regiment was eventually incorporated into the Ukrainian National Guard, retaining its symbols. With some rare exceptions, the Western mainstream media and politicians have paid little or no attention to Azov and similar far-right units supported by Kiev.\n\nThe attitude towards the unit in the US started to shift somewhat in recent years. In 2018, Congress voted to ban military aid to Azov fighters. In the same year, 56 lawmakers signed a letter, condemning the unit for promoting neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic views.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
