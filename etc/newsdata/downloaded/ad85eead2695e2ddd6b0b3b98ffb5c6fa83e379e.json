The 178-year-old firm also operated around 600 UK stores.\n\nCAA said it had arranged an aircraft fleet for the British repatriation effort lasting two weeks beginning Monday.\n\n\u201cDue to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nMost of Thomas Cook\u2019s British customers are protected by the government-run travel insurance program, which makes sure vacationers can get home if a British-based tour operator goes under while they are abroad.\n\nThomas Cook, which began in 1841 with a one-day train excursion in England and now operates in 16 countries, has been struggling over the past few years. It only recently raised 900 million pounds ($1.12 billion), including from leading Chinese shareholder Fosun.\n\nIn May, the company reported a debt burden of 1.25 billion pounds and cautioned that political uncertainty related to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union had hurt demand for summer holiday travel. Heat waves over the past couple of summers in Europe have also led many people to stay at home, while higher fuel and hotel costs have weighed on the travel business.\n\nThe company\u2019s troubles were already affecting those traveling under the Thomas Cook banner.\n\nA British vacationer told BBC radio on Sunday that the Les Orangers beach resort in the Tunisian town of Hammamet, near Tunis, demanded that guests who were about to leave pay extra money for fear it wouldn\u2019t be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook.\n\nRyan Farmer, of Leicestershire, said many tourists refused the demand, since they had already paid Thomas Cook, so security guards shut the hotel\u2019s gates and \u201cwere not allowing anyone to leave.\u201d\n\nIt was like \u201cbeing held hostage,\u201d said Farmer, who is due to leave Tuesday. He said he would also refuse to pay if the hotel asked him.\n\nThe Associated Press called the hotel, as well as the British Embassy in Tunis, but no officials or managers were available for comment.", "description": "Travel bookings for its more than 600,000 global vacationers were canceled early Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88287c2300009105d4ae43.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
