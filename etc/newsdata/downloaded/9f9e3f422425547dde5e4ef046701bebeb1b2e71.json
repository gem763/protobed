That would be wrong. Climate change is a planetary problem and prompt action is needed. But it is not, as Ms Thunberg furiously claims, \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d among her elders. Direct investment in green technology is growing very rapidly and becoming more effective as its cost falls. At recent rates of growth it should reach the US$800 billion in annual investment that McKinsey says will be needed before 2030. And there is not a single industry that isn\u2019t going through a costly transition as it adapts to a low-carbon future.\n\nThe strongest signals to do all this are now coming from markets. As exclusively reported in The Australian Financial Review today, it is the former Socialist politician Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, who says that it\u2019s private capital, not government, that is stepping up to \u201cthe economy of the future\u201d. And it is Atlassian\u2019s Mike Cannon-Brookes who is talking of exporting a new generation of Australian energy to Asia from giant solar farms. But destroying prosperity to hit the accelerated carbon targets that youthful demonstrators want is hardly a cure. What a teen from wealthy Sweden denounces as \u201cfairytales of eternal economic growth\u201d is the ladder out of poverty for millions in emerging economies, for whom access to reliable electricity is an essential step. Climate change is important, but young zealots who lack perspective are not the people who will fix it.", "description": "What a teen from wealthy Sweden denounces as \u201cfairy tales of eternal economic growth\u201d is the ladder out of poverty for millions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2709%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0c4f4a60a765eac2a62f97564d54b5c8f598db43", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
