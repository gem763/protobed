(AP) - On a day when he became Tampa Bay\u2019s career passing leader, Jameis Winston and the Buccaneers lost another game.\n\n\u201cYou just have to move on to the next game and get better,\u201d the No. 1 overall pick from the 2015 NFL draft said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nThe fifth-year pro threw for 194 yards and a touchdown Sunday, moving ahead of Vinny Testaverde for first place on the franchise\u2019s all-time passing list with 14,822 yards in 57 games. He was also intercepted three times, with two of them being returned for touchdowns in a 31-17 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt was exactly the kind of performance that\u2019s become too common as Winston tries to establish himself as Tampa Bay\u2019s long-term solution at quarterback. He overcame Richard Sherman\u2019s early pick-six to lead a 75-yard TD drive to get the Bucs back in the game in the third quarter, only to falter down the stretch.\n\nThe 49ers sacked him three times and dropped what easily could have been two more interceptions before Ahkello Witherspoon intercepted a screen pass the quarterback was trying to throw away and ran 25 yards to put a six-point game out of reach with 2:01 remaining.\n\nTampa Bay lured Bruce Arians out of retirement last January in hopes the longtime coach and offensive coordinator could help Winston realize his potential. The coach is adamant that the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner has everything it takes to be elite if he can improve his decision-making and cut down on turnovers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a thing of growth,\u201d Arians said. \u201cYou have a screen pass called. \u2026 Our young running back goes inside and doesn\u2019t get out on the screen. So, just throw it out of bounds. If you get a grounding (penalty), you get a grounding. But don\u2019t leave it on the field of play.\u201d\n\nWinston completed 20 of 36 passes and was sacked three times. On one drive in the first half, holding calls on tackle Demar Dotson wiped out what would have been TD passes to Cameron Brate.\n\n\u201cWe did a bad job of beating ourselves, and we\u2019ve got to go back and stop that,\u201d Dotson said. \u201cIf we do a better job of not beating ourselves, then we can beat somebody else.\u201d\n\nArians agreed.\n\nIn addition to Winston\u2019s three interceptions, tight end O.J. Howard lost a fumble to ruin one scoring opportunity. The Bucs also hurt themselves in the fourth quarter when, trailing 20-14, Arians decided against kicking a short field goal and the offense wound up turning the ball over on downs at the San Francisco 2.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any doubt about it,\u201d the coach said, when asked if he felt his team beat itself. \u201cWe talked about it at the half, even, and before the game. \u2026 That was the message. When we stop beating ourselves, we\u2019ll be pretty good.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On a day when he became Tampa Bay's career passing leader, Jameis Winston and the Buccaneers lost another game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/49ers_buccaneers_football_65010_c0-955-2082-2168_s1770x1032.jpg?87ecced51e1e3d4f64ac6fdc75db5067b25ef929", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
