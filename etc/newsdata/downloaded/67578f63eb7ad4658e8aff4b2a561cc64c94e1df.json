Charged With Market Manipulation", "language": "en", "text": "The charges also put pressure on Mr. P\u00f6tsch, who was chief financial officer at the time that the scandal came to light in 2015 and was responsible for communicating with shareholders. As supervisory board chairman, Mr. P\u00f6tsch oversees senior management and presides over the annual shareholders meeting.\n\n\u201cThe indictment against Mr. P\u00f6tsch is unfounded,\u201d lawyers for Mr. P\u00f6tsch said in a statement. \u201cIn the summer of 2015, no obligation to inform the capital market arose at any time even from a purely capital market law perspective.\u201d\n\nMr. Winterkorn\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that he had trusted assurances from Volkswagen employees that excess emissions in diesel cars were the result of a technical problem, which could be worked out with regulators in the United States.\n\nVolkswagen later admitted it had programmed the vehicles to recognize when an emissions test was underway and to crank up pollution controls so the cars were deemed compliant. During on-the road driving the cars polluted far more than allowed.\n\nMr. Winterkorn \u201chad no prior knowledge of the intentional use of forbidden motor management software in diesel passengers cars in the U.S.,\u201d the statement said. Mr. Winterkorn, who resigned days after the emissions scandal burst into public view, already faces fraud charges in connection with the emissions cheating, which he has denied.\n\nThe charges come only weeks after Volkswagen unveiled a four-door hatchback, the ID.3, that the company said would be the first of a line of moderately priced electric vehicles, making emission-free transportation accessible to middle-class buyers.\n\nHiltrud Dorothea Werner, a member of Volkswagen\u2019s management board responsible for instilling a stronger sense of ethics, said on Tuesday that the charges were unfounded. The case could also have financial consequences for Volkswagen. Shareholders have sued, seeking damages the could reach $10 billion.", "description": "The three were charged by German prosecutors with failing to inform investors of the U.S. investigation into emissions cheating.", "authors": ["Jack Ewing"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/business/24volkswagen1/24volkswagen1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
