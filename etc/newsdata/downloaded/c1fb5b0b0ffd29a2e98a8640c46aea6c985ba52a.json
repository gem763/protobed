People are scared of intruders and strangers, even though Saifi sports a little white cap that\u2019s the emblem of the Aam Aadmi party (Common Man), or AAP, which rules the Indian capital.\n\nBut other times, she, and the plumber accompanying her, are invited in, and they check for leaks in bathrooms and kitchens.\n\nSaifi and the plumber, Mohammed Nazim, are part of a water saving campaign launched by AAP leader Somnath Bharti in his constituency of Malviya Nagar. Bharti was inspired by Aabid Surti, a former cartoonist and writer, who offers the same service to homes in Mumbai.\n\nBharti says it was the sight of \u201cpeople fighting over water, people crying over water\u201d in slum areas of New Delhi, where residents rely on tankers to deliver water, that galvanised him into action.\n\n\u201cWe use WhatsApp to organise our volunteers who go whenever they have time \u2013 during weekdays or weekends. It\u2019s serving a dual purpose. The team of volunteers and a plumber fix the leaks but also make people aware of the need to save water if the city is to be spared the dire predictions of experts,\u201d says Bharti.\n\nHow Delhi's rising heat and a love of concrete caused a deadly water crisis Read more\n\nA report last year by the government-run thinktank NITI Aayog predicted that 21 major cities in India are poised to run out of groundwater in 2020. Anxious to do his bit \u2013 and perhaps with an eye on elections to the New Delhi assembly in February 2020 \u2013 Bharti launched his campaign last month. New Delhi\u2019s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, has said that if the pilot project produces results, it will be replicated across the capital.\n\nKnocking on doors is slow work, and not just because of the brutal humidity. The rules of Indian hospitality dictate that visitors take off their shoes, sit down, partake of refreshments and snacks, and indulge in pleasantries before the job of checking taps can begin.\n\nAt a third floor flat, the owner, Neelam Malik, welcomes the group and, after serving Pepsi and crisps, shows Nazim around. It takes him just a few minutes to fix a tap in the bathroom and a washer in the kitchen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Save Water campaigners, with AAP leader Somnath Bharti in white in the centre, in New Delhi.

You need to go there to tell them to make sure those overhead tanks don\u2019t leak because that is a huge waste,\u201d she says.\n\nIn New Delhi, even in the richest homes, piped water from the municipal authorities flows into homes for only a couple of hours a day. Home owners store the water in huge tanks placed on the roof.\n\nSitting inside their homes, residents have no way of knowing when the rooftop tanks are full. There are devices that will sound an alarm when water starts to overflow, but most residents don\u2019t have one.\n\nBharti is aware of the problem. \u201cWe are talking to the alarm manufacturers to see if they can provide them to us in bulk at subsidised prices so that we can give them to all residents at a low price,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a few months\u2019 time, Bharti will check the total amount of water supplied to Malviya Nagar to see if it has reduced as a result of the campaign.\n\nBut for Vikrant Tongad, a water conservationist and activist in the city, the AAP has got its priorities wrong. He welcomes Bharti\u2019s campaign but says plugging leaking taps is minor compared with the need to repair and modernise the underground water supply lines, which leak 40% of the city\u2019s total water supply before it gets anywhere near homes.\n\n\u201cThe pipes are so old and badly maintained that we [are losing] vast amounts of water,\u201d says Tongad. \u201cI appreciate Bharti\u2019s efforts but the party should focus on fixing the lines.\u201d\n\nBharti says the AAP government has plans in place. \u201cWe are replacing the old supply lines and using new technology that gauges the water pressure in the lines to alert engineers of any leaks,\u201d he says.\n\nIn Mumbai, Surti is pleased with the initiative\u2019s progress. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Delhi. I am getting groups of concerned citizens all over India telling me that they are following my example in their neighbourhood. Saving water is a global project which all Indians should join.\u201d", "description": "With the country\u2019s major cities set to run out of groundwater in 2020, volunteers are helping to conserve precious supplies", "authors": ["Amrit Dhillon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93307db8342c7fa4c7853ad9d11c9cbd7a1cddc/0_287_3470_2083/master/3470.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=002ef34f5f79c28197ac2ec6321fdd6e", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
