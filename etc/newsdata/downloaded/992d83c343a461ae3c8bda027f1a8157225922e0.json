Signatory countries account for about a quarter of the global economy.\n\nAlthough China has promised to decarbonise its energy system, it has continued to approve and finance coal projects, using $1 billion in \u201cgreen finance\u201d to fund coal-fired power projects in the first half of 2019.\n\nAccording to a study by environmental group Greenpeace, China has also invested in 67.9 gigawatts of coal-fired power in Belt and Road countries since 2014, compared to 12.6 GW of wind and solar.\n\nChina has also been criticized for investing in overseas coal-fired power projects using polluting technology no longer permitted at home.\n\nLi Gao, a senior Chinese climate official, told reporters on the sidelines of a briefing on Friday that as a matter of principle, China would not use outdated technology in overseas projects, but in practice this would depend on circumstances and the actual standards of the hosting country.", "description": "China's Belt and Road Initiative must bring cost-effective new low-carbon methods to developing countries and avoid outdated polluting technologies in order to ensure global climate goals are met, a new study said on Monday.", "authors": ["David Stanway", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
