US actions in Ukraine and Syria have demoralised America\u2019s friends and emboldened adversaries. The United States and the world are less safe as a result.\n\nThe latest moves come on the heels of the White House denigrating democracies, confiding in dictators over diplomats, extorting allies and undermining international institutions. Mistreatment of Ukraine\u2019s democratic government and Kurdish partners in Syria have delivered the coup de grace for America\u2019s international credibility.\n\nExpect friends to reduce reliance on the US further as they hedge their strategic bets. Many partners have limited capacity and choices and may find the available alternatives, such as China and Russia, to be more unpalatable. But let\u2019s be clear, many allies now trust the US less than at any time since World War II. The damage to the country\u2019s image and reputation will be hard to repair.\n\nLess than two decades removed from post-Soviet independence, Ukraine struggles to manage internal divisions and build democracy. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea, an autonomous republic of Ukraine, and its historic meddling continues unabated. Conditioning security assistance under these circumstances to influence a presidential election would constitute an epic shakedown.\n\nImpeachment inserts a new gratuitous element of unpredictability that factors into the calculations of US friends. If the president\u2019s decision in Syria is instructive, allies will gird themselves for a leader whose gut tells him to turn the country inward when under pressure.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s world view, national interests are narrowly defined and often conflated with his personal interests, values are largely irrelevant, and much of what happens outside US borders are other people\u2019s problems. Initially slow to grasp the rapidity of the disaster he had wrought in Syria, the president defiantly tweeted, \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d Over 18 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Trump was oblivious to the emerging security vacuum and the risk that America\u2019s enemies could once again use favourable conditions to bring the fight to its doorstep.\n\nThe abrupt decision led to the predictable collapse of a delicate truce in Northern Syria. Turkey\u2019s ensuing assault on the Kurds has claimed hundreds of lives and left at least 1,76,000 people homeless. Absent a small tripwire US presence to keep the peace, Kurdish fears of Turkish ethnic cleansing cannot be ruled out. More than 100 IS fighters detained by the Kurds escaped, their whereabouts unknown; the IS\u2019s ability to reconstitute itself amid the tumult has grown.\n\nLeft with no choice, the Kurds first turned to Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s brutal dictator, and Russia to save them from slaughter. Then they watched helplessly as Russia and Turkey carved up the border region.\n\nRoughly 11,000 Kurds died in combat to destroy IS\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d. Partners will think twice about fighting terrorists if it means being left exposed as Uncle Sam slips out the backdoor. Some stakeholders could reach the same conclusion as Iraq\u2019s former national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie: \u201cFor the Americans, their friends are disposable.\u201d\n\nIn Afghanistan, the Kabul government knows it could be blindsided next by a US exit \u2013 and so do Taliban. Elsewhere in Asia, Taiwan\u2019s future has grown more uncertain, and Hong Kong\u2019s young protesters may feel more alone than ever.\n\nSome likeminded friends might see American isolationism as a reason to join in defending international principles, as suggested for Asia earlier in Trump\u2019s tenure. Big trade deals are getting inked, just not with the US. Democracies such as Australia and India, for example, may enhance cooperation to counter a more powerful China. In the South China Sea, as Beijing asserts itself, European and Asia-Pacific democracies have conducted joint patrols in defence of the global norm of freedom of navigation.\n\nYet, even if the differences that complicate collective action were finessed, virtually no configuration of democracies would be a sufficient substitute for engaged American leadership. The country\u2019s military and economic strength is still unmatched, and it plays a unique convening role.\n\nIn the president\u2019s Hobbesian world where power trumps principle, a nationalist government in Turkey or a future conservative one in South Korea may conclude they can no longer depend on the US security umbrella and must take steps towards developing a nuclear bomb. Others will place a renewed premium on keeping options flexible, selectively partnering when national interests happen to align in a more multipolar world. India\u2019s new government appears headed in this direction, sending Washington signals it will cooperate with China, Europe, Japan, Russia and others when it suits New Delhi to do so.\n\nEven a nationalist Japanese government firmly anchored in the US alliance system has taken noticeable steps to improve ties with Beijing. Meanwhile, France has thawed relations, while Germany is growing economic ties, with Russia. If the US continues to retreat, Beijing\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s influence in their neighbourhoods will grow and be wielded with greater aplomb.\n\nFrom trade to climate change to Iran, America First is increasingly America Alone.\n\n\u00a9 2019 YaleGlobal", "description": "By Atman Trivedi and Santiago Herdoiza Washington, DC: One moment in October captures a foreign policy in chaos: In Syria, two American F-15E warplanes bombed a military base, headquarters of the US campaign against Islamic...", "authors": ["Atman Trivedi"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atman-M-Trivedi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
