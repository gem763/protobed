He hit eight different targets, including tight end George Kittle eight times for 103 yards.\n\nDespite playing without injured running back Todd Gurley, the Rams got a majority of their offensive production on the ground, led by Malcolm Brown's 40 yards on 11 carries and Darrell Henderson Jr.'s 39 on six carries.\n\nJared Goff, under constant pressure and sacked four times, was limited to 78 yards on 13-for-24 passing.\n\nThe seven-point total was the Rams' lowest since losing 13-3 to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl in February.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "The San Francisco 49ers remained the only unbeaten team in the NFC with a  suffocating defensive performance on the road Sunday afternoon, shutting out  the...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
