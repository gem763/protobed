Passin\u2019 Me By, The Pharcyde\n\nAt a time when the hardcore sounds of Death Row Records dominated LA\u2019s rap scene, The Pharcyde released a song about still being haunted by their failed childhood crushes. A melancholic head-nodder, Passin\u2019 Me By stirs with animated flows from the group\u2019s four pun-conscious lyricists atop a mellowed-out beat that samples Quincy Jones\u2019 Summer In The City. The playful vividness The Pharcyde grants to ordinarily mundane details of unrequited love, holds its weight against the spectacle of the period\u2019s gangsta rap \u2013 offering another expression of valid black manhood in hip-hop culture.\n\nThe song\u2019s climax comes at its fourth and final verse, which group member, Fatlip, decorates with now iconic quotables like \u201cthere she goes again the dopest Ethiopian\u201d and \u201cmy dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well\u201d. Yet it\u2019s the visceral utterance of his final \u201cDamn!\u201d \u2013 his response to the returned delivery of a letter to his love interest \u2013 that captures the all-too-familiar sense of longing at the song\u2019s core.
