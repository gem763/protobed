Now, fans are flooding the Bronx to find the famous stairs and get that perfect Instagram shot denoting that they have seen a movie and liked it.\n\nBronx natives have taken to social media to voice their distaste and issue warnings. Desus Nice, host of Desus and Mero, tweeted \"legally as a bronx resident you're allowed and encouraged to tax anyone visiting the joker stairs.\"\n\nEven so, the tourists, influencers, and cosplayers have descended, following the time-honored tradition of taking photos in locations made historic through film (and, like, history), including the Rocky stairs in Philadelphia, The Exorcist stairs in Washington, D.C., and Chernobyl. That last one is one big yikes.\n\nSome of the photos are pretty standard fare, with fans posing the same way Phoenix does in the movie.\n\nOthers have gotten, uh, creative, I suppose, by laying down on the stairs.\n\nOthers are nodding to the magic of cinema. Or something like that.\n\nThis one is just a really nice portrait.\n\nBut it's the cosplayers and influencers that, as always, take it to the next level.\n\nAnd if they can't get to the Bronx, they find whatever stairs will work.\n\nGotta admire that dedication.", "description": "Fans are flooding the Bronx to get the perfect photo denoting that they have seen a movie and liked it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9dad4fb4270000ac5fe9b/lede/1571412995453-joker.jpeg?crop=0.8910891089108911xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
