Answers have been many. Surely, then, there is room for a social novelist to tells us what has been going on in British hearts and minds.\n\nThis is the task Jonathan Coe turns to in \u201cMiddle England.\u201d Its setting is mostly Birmingham, the huge commercial and industrial city in the middle of the country. The novel centers on Benjamin Trotter and various family members and old school friends.\n\nAlmost all are middle class. Among them is Doug Anderton, who is a political columnist, and therefore has access to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s PR flunky. Doug\u2019s scenes with him are the sharpest satire in the novel, digging into the moral as well as the political failings that inspired the referendum. Later, when a snobbish and thoroughly obnoxious woman refuses to support an emigrant friend and suggests she return to where she came from, it\u2019s easy to see a major fault line in the social contract.\n\nOther characters also align with problems that inspired the leavers. Benjamin\u2019s father, Colin, feels sidelined by age and bereavement, but also by the closing of the vast car factory where he had spent his working life. Ian, who marries Benjamin\u2019s niece, Sophie, loses a promotion to an Anglo-Asian colleague. Apparently, he takes it in good part, but his income is affected and he votes to leave \u2014 though likely he would have done so anyway.\n\nSophie is incredulous when Ian tells her that the leave voters are going to win. Like most others, she just doesn\u2019t see it coming, and though she lives through its consequences she never really explores why it happened.\n\nIndeed, while \u201cMiddle England\u201d fields numerous characters who dramatize one of the likely impulses of the leave vote, the dots between their issues are never really connected because much of the limelight of the novel falls on the story of Sophie as she gets a job as a college teacher, marries Ian and works through the personal and work problems that come her way.\n\nThis is true also of Benjamin. In his 50s he is re-meeting and often helping old friends, while also thinking through options for the rest of his life. He is a pleasant, intelligent figure to spend time with, but he is an observer and never moves beyond his own remain sympathies.\n\nAs a political columnist Doug Anderton digs deeper, trying to break past the idea of a collective madness. \u201cHe knew that the outrage \u2026 was being stoked because it was valuable to someone: not to any one individual, of course, or even to one clearly identifiable movement or political party but to a disparate, amorphous coalition of vested interests who were being careful not to declare themselves too openly.\u201d\n\nDoug goes on to read a position paper from one Ronald Culpepper that bears this conjecture out. Elsewhere in \u201cMiddle England,\u201d several characters read from diaries, emails or other documents that are quoted at length. These form part of a patchwork \u2014 of texts, of characters, of issues, of locations \u2014 that hook readers\u2019 interest. But like a patchwork quilt, the parts that form the whole grab more attention than the finished work, which is after all, no more than a workaday object made from bright bits and pieces.\n\nOne reason for the bits and pieces in this novel is that author Jonathan Coe has re-used characters from his earlier novels, especially \u201cThe Rotters\u2019 Club\u201d and \u201cThe Closed Circle.\u201d References to Benjamin\u2019s earlier love of Cicely and his sister Lois\u2019 sufferings from psychological trauma often occur. One may at first assume that as the novel progresses the back stories will be filled in. That doesn\u2019t happen, and it makes both Benjamin and Lois much less interesting than they could have been.\n\nThe slack is taken up by the many other stories \u2014 of emigrant Grete and her husband, of Doug\u2019s intransigent daughter, Coriander, of Charlie the party clown, of Ian\u2019s horrible mother, Helena. All these tales \u2014 some heart-wrenching, some heart-warming \u2014 make \u201cMiddle England\u201d readable. But the Brexit vote may remain as mysterious as ever.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nMIDDLE ENGLAND\n\nBy Jonathan Coe\n\nAlfred A.
