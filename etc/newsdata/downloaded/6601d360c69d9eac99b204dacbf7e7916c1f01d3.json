They\u2019re snippets of encouragement aimed to remind you just what a total boss you are.\n\nMost of us could do more believing in ourselves. But one little boy is starting young as he has started repeating his affirmations on the way to school.\n\nPutting us all to shame when it comes to self-belief, little Ayaan, who is only three years old, was filmed repeating a positive mantra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told himself: \u2018I am smart. I am blessed. I can do anything\u2019. And it\u2019s made quite an impression on everybody else who\u2019s seen the video.\n\nHis mum Alissa, from New York, posted the clip where the adorable toddler can be seen chanting the words while walking with a banana in hand.\n\nThe post has since gone viral, racking up 124,000 likes and more than 3,000 comments.\n\nPeople can\u2019t get enough of Ayaan. Over on Twitter, the video amassed more than three million views.\n\nIt\u2019s even making some people want kids.\n\nAbsolute cutie (Picture: Instagram/@Alissa360style)\n\nAlissa wrote on the Instagram video: \u2018I taught Ayaan this positive affirmation on his second birthday last year, in hopes that he would one day memorize it, understand it and use it as a motivational tool whenever he needed it.\n\n\u2018Well, he shocked me this morning. Out of nowhere he started repeating it, so I pulled out my phone. He ended (with enthusiasm lol) once we made it to our destination. So proud of the little boy he is growing into.\u2019\n\nAlissa also used the hashtag #blackboyjoy to share the positive story.\n\nPeople have been commenting on and sharing the story in their droves.\n\nThis child is everything!!!! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) October 7, 2019\n\nJournalist Yashar Ali \u2013 one of Time\u2019s most influential people on the internet \u2013 shared the video and wrote: \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m having kids\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenting on his post, one Twitter user said: \u2018Not usually one for the cute kid videos (more a cute animal vid guy) but Jesus Christ if this isn\u2019t the cutest video I\u2019m likely to see in a while.\u2019\n\nEven Meghan McCain, daughter of the late U.S Senator John McCain and the host of The View, got involved. She wrote: \u2018This child is everything\u2019.\n\nWhat a sweet child. And don\u2019t you forget: You are smart. You are blessed.
