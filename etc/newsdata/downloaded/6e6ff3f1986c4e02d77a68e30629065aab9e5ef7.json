The school\u2019s head teacher, Elsa Mendoza M\u00e1rquez , had been killed on Aug. 3 in the mass shooting in El Paso. The parents had to explain to their young children why she was missing. The assistant head told them that Ms. Mendoza would always be in their hearts.\n\nMs. Mendoza, 57, was one of eight Mexican citizens among the 22 people who died in the attack, in which a man named Patrick Crusius is accused of shooting shoppers in a Walmart with an AK-style rifle. Most of the other victims were Americans of Mexican descent, while one was a German. Ms. Mendoza had crossed the border to see family in El Paso, according to reports, and popped into the store while her husband and son waited in the car.\n\nThe El Paso shooting was at the top of the agenda of the first meeting between President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and the new American ambassador, Christopher Landau, on Monday. (The last ambassador, Roberta Jacobson, resigned in May 2018, and has since been a vocal critic of President Trump.)\n\nMexico\u2019s position is that justice for the El Paso victims must include a condemnation of the hate that the authorities say drove Mr. Crusius to mass murder. \u201cWe think this case is decisive so these acts are not repeated,\u201d said Mexico\u2019s foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard.", "description": "Nothing can bring back the victims of the attack in El Paso, but the Mexican government knows that the way we label it matters.", "authors": ["Ioan Grillo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/opinion/30Grillo-web/30Grillo-web-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
