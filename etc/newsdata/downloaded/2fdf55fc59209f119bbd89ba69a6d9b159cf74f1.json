Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). The spot, created by a Republican PAC called New Faces GOP, described AOC as \"the face of socialism.\" The ad then shows her picture burning, before airing images of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia in the 1970s, orchestrated by brutal communist leader Pol Pot.\n\nRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist.\n\n\n\nLife is weird! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nThe congresswoman noted how ABC and Sinclair Broadcast Group would \"profit\" from burning her likeness on TV. While she could expect threats.\n\nThe image of AOC's face burning sparked a \"Boycott ABC\" trend online, led by Democratic leaders like the Democratic Coalition Co-founder Scott Dworkin. He added that ABC \"can go to hell.\"\n\n.@TheDemCoalition Co-founder Scott Dworkin criticized ABC for airing the commercial, suggesting it could incite extremists and put the AOC\u2019s life in jeopardy. \u201cABC can go to hell,\u201d Dworkin said. \u201cPeople need to be fired over this.\u201d #BoycottABC https://t.co/j1qbMuhMUg \u2014 Scott Dworkin (@funder) September 13, 2019\n\nSome of AOC's fellow Squad members spoke out about the ad too, calling it a display of violence.\n\nExactly my thoughts. The mere act of burning her image is a display of violence. Folks need to stick to facts & policy positions. They need to stop fear mongering & more importantly demonizing members of Congress. FYI: No one puts her residents (and our planet) first, like @AOC https://t.co/K2Qz1N0PeN \u2014 Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) September 13, 2019\n\nThe Republican lawmaker who narrated the ad, Elizabeth Heng, rejected those claims.\n\nNot Republicans. Me. Are you really calling me a racist @aoc? I\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology. Or are you just in Congress to hang out with celebrities and tweet out ridiculous ideas like the green new deal? https://t.co/w985LYjIZd \u2014 Elizabeth Heng (@ElizabethHeng) September 13, 2019\n\nHeng added that the Demcorats \"are more offended by truthful words than the acts of their political ideology that has killed millions of innocent victims.\"\n\nI \"don't care\" about AOC's feelings, Heng said. She \"cares about stopping her lies about the lies of socialism.\"", "description": ".09/13/2019 21:38:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/5db953eb-bbfc-4890-82f5-31fa75d46fcd.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
