REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean authorities scrambled on Monday to clear wreckage and re-open public transportation in the capital Santiago after a weekend of chaos in which at least seven people were killed amid violent clashes, arson attacks and looting in cities throughout Chile.\n\nSeveral Chilean cities were engulfed by days of riots, along with peaceful protests, after a hike in public transport costs. The violence prompted President Sebastian Pinera to declare a state of emergency, placing the military in charge of security in the city of six million.\n\nTransportation officials in Santiago brought in more than 400 buses to reinforce the city\u2019s fleet Monday morning, and re-opened the downtown line of the metro providing east-west transportation across the city.\n\nMost schools in the city closed, citing concerns of the safety of their workers and students.\n\nPinera extended the state of emergency late on Sunday night, saying \u201cwe are at war,\u201d against vandals who had turned out in droves throughout the capital over the weekend.\n\nJavier Iturriaga, the general in charge of Santiago\u2019s security, said in a televised broadcast early Monday he had conducted an overflight of Santiago and was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the situation. He said the military would nonetheless continue to provide security.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter if the country was at war, as Pinera had said late Sunday, Iturriaga responded, \u201cI\u2019m not at war with anyone. I\u2019m a happy man,\u201d he said.\n\nThe metro, which suffered multiple arson attacks at stations throughout the city, was operating smoothly during the morning rush, albeit with many fewer people than on a typical Monday morning. Many businesses told their workers to stay home.\n\nIn downtown Santiago, street sweepers cleaned up broken glass, scrap metal and barricades that accumulated over several nights of protests.\n\nNewly inked graffiti covered the face of nearly every building along many city blocks. Tear gas lingered in the air, forcing pedestrians to walk with faces covered.\n\nChile\u2019s mining minister said on Sunday that the country\u2019s mines operated normally through the weekend.\n\nA union of workers at BHP\u2019s Escondida copper mine, the world\u2019s largest copper mine, told Reuters early on Monday it would walk off the job for at least a shift on Tuesday in a show of support for the demands of protesters.\n\nChile is the world\u2019s top copper producer.", "description": "Chilean authorities scrambled on Monday to clear wreckage and re-open public transportation in the capital Santiago after a weekend of chaos in which at least seven people were killed amid violent clashes, arson attacks and looting in cities throughout Chile.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443345980&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0W9", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
