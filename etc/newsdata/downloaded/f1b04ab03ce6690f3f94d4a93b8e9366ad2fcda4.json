It\u2019s a light, fragrant and utterly delicious south-Indian-style curry, packed with juicy prawns and tempered with coconut milk.\n\nAlthough it looks impressive, it is actually very easy to make, so you can serve it either as a week-night supper or as an indulgent dinner. We serve it with idiyappam, the white, lacy noodle pancakes, also known as stringhoppers. If you can\u2019t get these, it goes just as well with steamed rice.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Set to one side. Place a large saucepan over a medium heat.\n\nAdd 40ml of the oil, let it warm for a few seconds, then add the mustard seeds and 20 curry leaves. Let them crackle for a few seconds.\n\nAdd the onions and saut\u00e9 lightly for 12\u201314 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic and ginger pastes, salt, black pepper and turmeric and saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the sliced chillies and ginger matchsticks and cook for 3 minutes.\n\nPour in the coconut milk and cream and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the curry is simmering, place a small frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tbsp oil. Toss in the rest of the curry leaves and fry for 1 minute, until crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and set aside.\n\nAdd the prawns and tomatoes to the sauce and simmer gently for a further 5\u20136 minutes, until the prawns are cooked; do not overcook or they will be tough. Serve scattered with the fried curry leaves, with lemon wedges on the side.\n\nNote: If you\u2019d like to prepare the dish in advance, make the sauce (up to and including step 5), chill and refrigerate, then reheat and continue from step 6 just before serving.\n\nOkra fries\n\nShamil grew up resisting okra \u2013 he never got past the slimy texture. However, Naved\u2019s recipe has since convinced him and many other lifelong okra-avoiders. These little snacks are crispy, light and deliciously addictive. They are even better when dipped into a chutney. The bowl will be empty before you know it.\n\nServes 4\n\n175g okra\n\n4g garlic paste\n\n4g ginger paste\n\n\u00bc tsp deggi mirch chilli powder\n\nVegetable oil for deep-frying\n\n15g chickpea (gram) flour\n\n10g cornflour\n\n\u00bd tsp \u201cmagic\u201d masala\n\nTo serve\n\nChilli, coriander-mint and/or tamarind chutney\n\nWash the okra under cold water and pat completely dry with kitchen paper. Take off and discard the top of each okra, leaving the tail intact. Slice in half lengthways if young and small; quarter the okra lengthways if large.\n\nMix together the garlic and ginger pastes, chilli powder and 4 tsp water. Add the okra halves and mix well to ensure they are well coated.\n\nHeat the oil in a deep-fryer or other suitable deep, heavy-based pan to 180C. Mix the two flours together. Sprinkle over the okra and toss very gently to coat.\n\nFry the okra in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until golden and crispy, about 4\u20135 minutes. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with \u201cmagic\u201d masala and serve immediately, with your choice of chutneys(s).\n\nKejriwal\n\nFried eggs atop chilli cheese on toast is a favourite of the well-to-do Willingdon Club, the first such Bombay institution to admit Indians. It is reputedly named after the member (not to be confused with the Indian politician Arvind Kejriwal) who, not allowed by his wife to eat eggs at home, kept asking for the dish in his club.\n\nThe most convenient way of finishing the eggs here is to use a frying pan that can go into the oven. If you don\u2019t have one, fry the eggs until cooked in the pan, then top with the cheese, spring onions, chilli and pepper. The cheese won\u2019t melt quite as much, but it will still be delicious. If your frying pan is reliably non-stick you should need little or no oil.\n\nServes 1\n\n80g mature Cheddar, grated\n\n1 or 2 thick slices of white bloomer, sourdough or brioche (depending on size and level of hunger)\n\n2 spring onions, chopped\n\n1 green chilli, very finely chopped\n\n1 tsp vegetable oil (optional)\n\n1 or 2 large eggs (one per slice of toast)\n\nCoarsely ground black pepper\n\nTo serve\n\nTomato ketchup\n\nLet the grated cheese come up to room temperature; it needs to be quite soft and workable. Heat the oven to 240\u00b0C/Fan 220\u00b0C/Gas 9. Place a baking tray inside to warm up.\n\nToast the bread until very lightly browned on both sides. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the topping. Put a small handful of the grated cheese (roughly 10g), 1 tsp chopped spring onion and a pinch of green chilli to one side, to be used when you fry the egg(s).\n\nCrack the egg(s) into a cup or small bowl, being careful to keep the yolk(s) intact. Put the remaining cheese, spring onions and green chilli into a bowl, add plenty of black pepper and mix well. Using the back of a spoon (or your fingers), work the cheese mixture into a paste by pressing it firmly into the side of the bowl.\n\nSpread the cheese mix evenly over the toast and press it in, using the back of the spoon, to create a firm, even layer that goes all the way to the edges of the toast. Place on the tray in the oven and cook for 6\u20138 minutes, until deep golden and bubbling.\n\nWhile the chilli cheese toast is cooking, warm a frying pan over a high heat and, if using, add the oil. Gently tip the egg(s) into the hot pan and add some black pepper. Top with the reserved grated cheese, spring onion and green chilli. Place the frying pan in the oven and cook for 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the egg white(s) are cooked but the yolk(s) are still runny.\n\nCarefully slide the egg(s) onto the cheese on toast and serve right away, with plenty of tomato ketchup.\n\n'Dishoom' by Shamil Thakrar, Kavi Thakrar & Naved Nasir (Bloomsbury, \u00a326) is out now.
