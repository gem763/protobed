And he doesn\u2019t lack ambition. Of Si\u00e1n, he says, \u201cI wanted to create a design that is beyond design.\u201d\n\nThe Lamborghini 350 GT grand tourer, the first car to bear the Raging Bull emblem.\n\nLore has it that the Lamborghini car brand was born when wealthy industrialist Ferruccio Lamborghini complained directly to Enzo Ferrari that the Ferrari he had just bought was riddled with design flaws. It was the early 1960s and, depending on which version you prefer, Enzo refused to meet Ferruccio, or did meet him and quipped \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the way I build my cars, why don\u2019t you build your own in that tractor factory you have?\u201d\n\nEither way, Ferruccio set out to take on Enzo from 1963 (the foundation year is the justification for Lamborghini building 63 examples of the Si\u00e1n). The first model was the 350 GT grand tourer, with Lamborghini using a Raging Bull emblem to trump Ferrari\u2019s Prancing Horse, and a 3.5-litre V12 engine to outdo Ferrari\u2019s 3-litre unit.\n\nIts brutal looks made the Lamborghini Countach a design icon of the 1970s.\n\nHowever, it was the extraordinary Miura from 1966 that made the sports-car world realise that Lamborghini was something more than just another shooting star in the Italian sports car firmament. Technically it was revolutionary \u2013 its complex 3.9-litre V12 mounted transversely and amidships \u2013 but for many, the game-changer was the Miura\u2019s styling.\n\nThe ultra-low coupe is still cited by many internationally acclaimed designers as the most beautiful Italian sports car of them all. Even Ferrari\u2019s current head of design, Flavio Manzoni, has told AFR Magazine it was \u201cperfect from every angle.\u201d\n\nSeulah Park was born more than two decades after the Miura was unveiled, yet she says that as a schoolgirl in South Korea it influenced her desire to style cars. Park is now a lead designer at Audi.\n\nThat\u2019s why brands like Lamborghini are so important to the design world. They inspire people, and they take stylistic and technical risks that no mainstream manufacturer could contemplate. In doing so, they have their share of missteps but push forward the limits of what is thought possible.\n\nAfter Miura, Lamborghini continued to produce cars with bigger engines and more extravagant styling than its near neighbour (the Raging Bull is based in Sant\u2019Agata Bolognese in northern Italy, about 35 kilometres from the Prancing Horse\u2019s Maranello headquarters).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe more brutal-looking Countach followed Miura and is considered a design icon of the 1970s. And it is the Countach, rather than the Miura, that is Borkert\u2019s favourite historic \u201cLambo\u201d.\n\nThe later Diablo also won fans with its outrageous appearance and exemplary performance. But like most specialist builders of sports cars, Lamborghini itself was often cash-strapped, regularly bought and resold, and spent much of its life perilously close to bankruptcy \u2013 and even beyond.\n\nSales in 1992 were just 166 units. It finally found stability when it was bought by the VW Group in 1998, though sales remained in the hundreds into the new century.\n\nThe journey to the Raging Bull was a long one for Borkert. His early years were behind the Iron Curtain, cutting out photos of the cars he most liked from magazines his brother managed to sneak into East Germany from Hungary.\n\nAlthough Hungary was also in the Soviet Bloc, it was less concerned with the risk of stoking consumer desire with stories about interesting cars. Borkert\u2019s local streets might have been filled with Trabants, but he had Lamborghinis on his bedroom walls like millions of boys in the West, and he dreamed of being a car designer.\n\nHe believed that considering where he lived, his was an impossible dream. Then the Berlin Wall came down and, suddenly, for a 15-year-old would-be car designer, the world cracked wide open. Borkert graduated in transportation design from the Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences, and, just nine years after German reunification, was working at Porsche\u2019s design centre.\n\nHe became head of Advanced Design, and, in 2014, director of Exterior Design. He was responsible for the much-acclaimed Porsche Mission E concept car which became, in production form, this year\u2019s fully electric Porsche Taycan.\n\nSi\u00e1n is the first step towards the total individualisation of our cars. My dream as a designer is that we are creating only unique cars. \u2014 Mitja Borkert\n\nWhen Borkert left Porsche to join Lamborghini in 2016 (both companies are part of the VW Group), his first job was to finish off a work-in-progress: the Urus. This was Lamborghini\u2019s first modern SUV, the very mention of which horrified some sports car purists. However, with its sweeping roofline, angled forward wheel arches, raised rear end and bold geometric shapes, it has become a huge success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPorsche\u2019s argument when it pioneered \u201cthe super sports SUV\u201d all those years ago was that it would generate more money for it to develop sports cars, and Lamborghini argues much the same thing. The Urus is the major reason the company is close to doubling its sales this year, on top of the 51 per cent gain recorded last year.\n\nBorkert sees leading Lamborghini as a once-in-a-lifetime \u201cmega opportunity\u201d. As if to square the circle, Marcello Gandini, the designer of the Miura and the Countach (and many legendary cars for other makers), comes back into the story. When Borkert finished the Urus he invited Gandini, now in his 80s, to Centro Stile to see it. The feedback was all positive, Borkert later said, telling Cool Hunting, \u201cThat was a magical Lamborghini moment. Unbelievable.\u201d\n\nSi\u00e1n means \u201cflash\u201d or \u201clightning\u201d in the Bolognese dialect \u2013 a reference to the electrical helping hand this model receives from its petrol-electric drivetrain. It\u2019s the first hybrid drivetrain offered by Lamborghini, and incorporates a 48-volt supercapacitor that the company claims is three times lighter than a lithium-ion battery pack producing the same power.\n\nMitja Borkert, head of Laborghini design studio Centro Stile, will create \"art cars\" with 63 new owners of the $5.3 million Si\u00e1n. Charlie Magee\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just do a design without also delivering technology,\u201d says Borkert. \u201cWe are using [these] cars always to present technology for the first time \u2026 this is our introduction to electrification, but it is still a Lamborghini in the style of Lamborghini.\u201d\n\nThe project provides further proof that super high-performance sports cars and even V12 engines can survive into the next era, using leading-edge technology to not only run cleaner, but faster.\n\nAlthough the new car\u2019s technology points forward, Borkert says the styling does not. \u201cThis design has no outlook to anything that is coming in the future. It is 101 per cent design for the Si\u00e1n. It is taking inspiration in a very futuristic way from the Countach, but absolutely not retrospective.\u201d\n\nLamborghini's distinctive 1970s Espada.\n\nHe says the profile is similar to the Countach and he dubs the marque\u2019s distinctive silhouette \u201cthe Gandini line\u201d to honour the iconic designer. \u201cOn the top view is the Periscopio, which was this little glass window on the first Countach [allowing the driver to see the road through the rear-view mirror].\n\n\"Here we did the Periscopio like a big theme that is floating into the rear of the car, having this glass panel which changes with one button from transparent to see-through. It is flowing into what I call myself the Espada theme: this centre spike with the glass panel on top of the engine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Espada was another radically designed 1970s Lamborghini. Borkert continues to point out both small homages and intricate modern details, then smiles. \u201cYou can take a look at this car like you drink a good glass of wine, you discover the flavours and it\u2019s an experience.\u201d\n\nThe Si\u00e1n has 3D-printed exterior air vents and 3D-printed controls inside. Borkert hopes this trend goes further. \u201cPeople want character, they want something special. Especially on exclusive cars like Lamborghini \u2026 Just imagine sitting here in eight or 10 years and it is possible to be able to create fenders bespoke because they are coming out of 3D printing.\u201d\n\nBorkert says an individualised approach is in the best tradition of Lamborghini. Even the Miura coupe, he points out, was built in more than 60 colour combinations during its seven years on the market.\n\n\u201cSi\u00e1n is the first step towards the total individualisation of our cars. My dream as a designer is that we are creating only unique cars, even the Huracans [the company\u2019s entry-level mid-engined coupe] and Uruses to be different. Of course it is possible.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the head designer is working with some extreme ideas on behalf of the 63 owners or \u201cco-designers\u201d. They are selecting the colours and colour zones, carbon-fibre finishes, leathers, metals, exotic materials and even sign-writing that will cover the complex surfacing of each Si\u00e1n interior and exterior.\n\nA radical approach planned for one example involves the use of a luminous colour along the edges, which may well be a world first. \u201cImagine you come into your garage and switch off your lights and still see the design lines.\u201d\n\nThe Frankfurt show car is finished in Verde Gea (green) with details in Oro Electrum (electric gold), the latter hue containing real gold flakes and crystals. Borkert says how well the \u201cart cars\u201d turn out will depend at least partly on how well everyone gets along.\n\n\u201cThe 63 buyers will have the best experience you can have because they are flying in a very comfortable way, we are really preparing everything, a perfect presentation, we are making everything comfy and cosy and futuristic. Then it is the chemistry between them and me, and if they like what we recommend.\u201d\n\nBorkert points out that Lamborghini is currently in the best shape it has ever been. VW Group investment is enabling it to produce more models, which in turn is generating record sales and enabling more money to go back into research and development \u2013 and the thing most designers most like designing: ultra-exclusive super sports cars. \u201cIt\u2019s the best time to be at Lamborghini.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElectricity for the environment, power for the people\n\nWith Si\u00e1n, Lamborghini has produced what is known as a \u201cmild hybrid\u201d. However, unlike almost every other mild hybrid, the Si\u00e1n\u2019s electrical system \u2013 which includes a 26 kW electric motor built into the gearbox \u2013 provides torque to the wheels.\n\nIt powers the car on its own when reversing or manoeuvring at low speeds, and its output is added to that of the V12 when the car is accelerating.\n\nSi\u00e1n is the most powerful \"Lambo\" ever and the use of light materials such as carbon-fibre also gives it the best power-to-weight ratio. Lamborghini is also working with MIT researchers on \"extreme areas\" such as self-healing bodywork using nanotechnology.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate,\u201d Maurizio Reggiani, chief technical officer, tells AFR Magazine. \u201cWe have much more freedom than any other brand to try to reach a creative solution, to be a rule breaker. And I think hybridisation, electrification, call it what you like, sooner or later will come to everybody, it is only a question of defining what is the right time.\u201d\n\nWhen linked to an upgraded version of the familiar Lamborghini V12, the total power delivered is 602 kW. That makes the Si\u00e1n the most powerful \u201cLambo\u201d ever and the use of light materials such as carbon-fibre also gives it the best power-to-weight ratio.\n\nThe top speed is over 350km/h and, thanks also to all-wheel drive and low down electrical torque, the claimed 0-100km/h time is under 2.8 seconds. Again, that\u2019s a record for Lamborghini.\n\nReggiani says the supercapacitor takes up less packaging room than a battery pack and can be charged and recharged, quickly and repeatedly, without the risk of overheating. It is just one of the \u201cextreme areas\u201d Lamborghini continues to examine in a special program it has set up with MIT researchers.\n\nAnother is using nanotechnology to enable the storing of electrical energy inside carbon fibre. In such a scenario, the car\u2019s bodywork and chassis would themselves act as a supercapacitor. That\u2019s still some way away, he admits. Another is self-healing bodywork, again using nanotechnology.\n\nThe next generation of the higher volume Lamborghini coupes \u2013 Huracan and Aventador \u2013 will also be hybrid, says Reggiani, and they will probably have more electrical power than the Si\u00e1n.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey may need to cover a mandated distance on full electricity to be allowed to enter certain cities, for example. The challenge, he says, is meeting all future legislation \u2013 and emission-free European CBDs are widely forecast \u2013 while addressing the demands of owners.\n\n\u201cHow many kilometres we can do electrically is for the legislators, how much power we can produce is for the customer.\u201d\n\nReggiani believes hybrid drivetrains provide another advantage: they might allow the company to avoid turbocharging all its engines.\n\n\u201cIn a super sports car we think naturally aspirated is the best choice that you can have, in terms of sound, in terms of emotion, responsiveness.\u201d\n\nDespite recent Lamborghini successes, Reggiani knows there is plenty of disruption ahead, plus ever more demanding legislation, and heightened buyer expectations.\n\n\u201cFrom an engineering point of view,\u201d says Reggiani, \u201cevery new challenge must be taken like a provocation.\u201d\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
