Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe feud is also good news for Gabbard, D-Hawaii, whose presidential candidacy is on life-support. She is supported by only 1.3 percent of Democrats in the latest RealClear Politics average of presidential primary polls.\n\nBut thanks to her feud with Clinton, Gabbard is attracting heavy media coverage \u2013 something she desperately needs to give her dark horse presidential candidacy any chance of success.\n\nTULSI GABBARD TO HILLARY CLINTON: 'STEP DOWN FROM YOUR THRONE'\n\nGabbard added fuel to the feud Tuesday when she released a new campaign video attacking Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. And Gabbard tweeted: \u201c@HillaryClinton your foreign policy was a disaster for our country and the world. It\u2019s time for you to acknowledge the damage you have caused and step down from your throne.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton-Gabbard battle burst into the headlines last week, when Clinton said in an interview that the Russians have \u201cgot their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe's the favorite of the Russians,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton didn\u2019t name Gabbard, it was clear that the former first lady, senator and secretary of state was referring to the Hawaii congresswoman.\n\nClinton also said that 2016 Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein was a \u201cRussian asset\u201d \u2013 a charge Stein denied and called \u201ca ludicrous, unhinged conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.\u201d\n\nGabbard posted a video Sunday denouncing Clinton and saying she would not be silenced by Clinton and \"her gang of rich, powerful elite.\"\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t resist getting into the middle of the feud Monday, telling reporters that Clinton is \u201caccusing everyone of being a Russian agent.\u201d The president added that Gabbard is \u201cnot a Russian agent.\u201d\n\nAnd other Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson \u2013 said they don\u2019t believe Gabbard is a Russian asset.\n\nEnough with this Democrat-on-Democrat fighting!\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidates need to be clear that their opponent is Donald Trump \u2013 not each other.\n\nThis latest infighting is a distraction and is turning off voters. If Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.\n\nIn 2016, the bitter race for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 which ended with Clinton defeating Sanders \u2013 led some Democratic voters to stay home or vote for Trump. This may have given Trump the margin he needed to win the presidential race in the Electoral College, even though Clinton had about 3 million more popular votes.\n\nMy fellow Democrats have to ask themselves: Are we going to support each other despite our personal or political differences so that we can send Trump into political retirement? Or is the temptation to tear each other down and highlight our differences more important? If we choose the latter, we\u2019ll most likely lose \u2013 just like we did in 2016.\n\nIs there any merit to Hillary Clinton\u2019s accusations against Gabbard and SteinIf Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.\n\nIf Democrats spend a lot of time and energy attacking each other in a civil war, Trump will have a much better shot at reelection, enabling him to cause even greater harm to our nation than he has caused already.\n\nStein received about 1.5 million votes in 2016, but reports have come out of Congress showing that Russian election meddling directly contributed to that total. And of course, many of us remember the famous photo of Stein sitting at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin back in 2015.\n\nAs for Gabbard, it\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s not a huge Clinton fan nor vice versa. In 2016, the congresswoman resigned as the vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in order to endorse Sanders in his nomination fight against Clinton.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons Gabbard is barely registering in the polls.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFor example, in 2016 Gabbard advocated that the U.S. work with Syria\u2019s brutal dictator Bashar Assad, who has used chemical warfare against his own civilian population in the Syrian civil war. An estimated 400,000 people have been killed in the civil war, which began in 2011, and about 5.7 million Syrians have fled their country to escape the fighting, according to the U.N.\n\nIn 2017 Gabbard even traveled to Syria and met with Assad.\n\nAdditionally, according to news reports, Twitter bots that seem to originate in Russia have been quite active on Gabbard\u2019s behalf. And Russian state media have been giving her a disproportionate amount of coverage, considering she is barely registering in the polls.\n\nBut all this aside, should the Democrats be talking about this? Should Hillary Clinton have said anything about Gabbard? And should Gabbard have responded?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo, no and no.\n\nFor the sake of the American people \u2013 who need to replace Trump because his failed leadership, divisiveness and erratic behavior are causing more and more serious problems for our country and the world \u2013 I hope Clinton and Gabbard stop attacking each other. They need to use all their energy to concentrate on making the case for replacing Trump.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "description": "As President Trump\u2019s misconduct grows more appalling and the case for his impeachment grows stronger every day, Democrats have given him one piece of good news: the escalating and harmful feud between presidential contender Rep.
