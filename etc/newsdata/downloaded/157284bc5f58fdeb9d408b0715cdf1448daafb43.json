North Korea has criticised South Korea for adopting hi-tech weapons and continuing joint military drills with the United States.\n\nThe Kumgangsan Hotel at the Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea has been all but deserted since South Korea stopped tourists from visiting in 2008 [File: Dita Alangkara/Ap Photo]\n\nGhost resort\n\nSouth Koreans began visiting Mt Kumgang in 1998, and some of South Korea's biggest corporations poured more than a billion dollars into what they hoped would be a world-class travel destination.\n\nBut after a North Korean soldier shot dead a South Korean tourist who wandered unknowingly into a military area in 2008, South Korea suspended tours, leaving the resort all but empty of visitors.\n\nTourism is not under international sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear programmes and has become central to Kim's policy of \"self-reliant\" economic growth.\n\n\"The entire people should cherish the belief that self-reliance is the only way to live,\" North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun said in a separate commentary on Wednesday. \"There is nothing more foolish than to expect help from others today.\"\n\nThe resumption of Mt Kumgang tours has been repeatedly mentioned as a possibility by South Korean President Moon Jae-in in recent years.\n\nDuring a summit with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in September 2018, Moon and Kim had agreed to normalise Mt Kumgang tours and the Kaesong industrial complex \"as soon as the environment is created,\" Moon announced at the time.\n\nIn April, United States President Donald Trump was asked before a summit with Moon his stance on the possibility of restarting tours to Mt Kumgang.\n\n\"This isn't the right time, but at the right time I'd have great support,\" Trump said, according to South Korean presidential office records.\n\n\"They have unbelievable location ... surrounded by sea on two sides, the other side Russia, and China and over here SK,\" Trump said, referring to North Korea. \"You just can't do better than that. And they have magnificent land. It has tremendous potential.\"", "description": "Kim Jong Un says facilities are 'shabby' and need to better reflect North Korea's national character.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/c969cd2a5d5b4b2d8ed99e9ada664bbd_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
