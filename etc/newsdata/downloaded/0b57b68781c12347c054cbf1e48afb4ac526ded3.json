Kelly Myers.\n\nThe poll, conducted Oct. 9-13, has Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden tied in the lead of the current Democratic field in the Granite State primary, with Sen. Bernard Sanders slightly behind.\n\n\u201cToday, the Democratic race is a statistical dead heat between Warren (25%), Biden (24%) and Sanders (22%). If Michelle Obama were to enter the race, it would change things dramatically. Twenty-six percent of Democrats would vote for her, making her the new front-runner. Under this scenario, Obama (26%) would lead Warren (20%), (Biden (20%) and Sanders (15%). She would take away four points from Warren, four points from Biden and seven points from Sanders,\u201d Mr. Meyers said.\n\nAnd while we are mulling this possibility, consider this bumper sticker should the two former first ladies join forces and go for broke: \u201cObama/Clinton 2020.\u201d\n\nAnd while we are mulling that possibility, consider that the tabloids have been buzzing about Mrs. Obama and former President Barack Obama, with less than promising news.\n\n\u201c$150 million at stake: Barack hires divorce lawyers. Livid Michelle\u2019s revenge: Running for president,\u201d trumpets a new headline from The Globe, a gossip tabloid.\n\n\u201cThe tabloid\u2019s only proof was Barack not wearing his wedding ring during a speaking engagement in Germany on Sept. 29,\u201d counters International Business Times in an analysis of the untidy possibilities.\n\nA CONSTITUTIONAL SURGE\n\nSince President Trump took office, print edition sales of the Constitution have never been higher, a major industry group reports. Popular printed versions of the founding document have risen by double digits since 2016, according to The NPD Group, a global information company that tracks sales of books and other products.\n\n\u201cRegardless of your political affiliation, there is no doubt that our current political climate has done wonders for constitutional engagement,\u201d says Kristen McLean, a book industry analyst for NPD BookScan.\n\nSome 275,000 print editions of the Constitution were sold in 2016, the year Mr. Trump was elected president, which is the greatest number of print edition sales of the Constitution sold since NPD BookScan began tracking U.S. book sales in 2004. Average monthly sales of the Constitution have increased 60% in the Trump era, with an average of 19,800 copies sold each month during his first 33 months in office. By way of comparison, the monthly average was 7,500 in Barack Obama\u2019s first term and 5,600 in George W. Bush\u2019s second term.\n\n\u201cCurrent year-to-date sales are more than 50,000 units higher than at any point in the terms of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush, and we still have more than two months left in 2019,\u201d Ms. McLean noted.\n\nConstitution print edition sales tended to spike around key news events during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term, such as his nomination and inauguration. The most recent sales spike is occurring now, following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s push for formal impeachment hearings, the group said.\n\nPICKY DEMOCRATS\n\nWell, the fourth Democratic presidential debate has come and gone \u2014 perhaps leaving some potential collateral damage among the dozen hopefuls who duked it out on a crowded stage.\n\nA new survey has detected dissatisfaction among voters who will ultimately choose the final nominee.\n\n\u201cEven Democrats aren\u2019t overly thrilled about their party\u2019s presidential debates so far, but one-in-five who\u2019ve followed the debates say they\u2019ve switched candidates since they began,\u201d reports a Rasmussen Reports survey, which shows that eight out of 10 likely Democratic voters have closely followed the debates so far.\n\nWhile 53% still favor the candidate they liked before the debates, 19% have already switched their support to someone else because of the debates, the poll found. Twenty-eight percent remain undecided.\n\n\u201cOnly 42% of Democrats, however, think their party\u2019s debates have done a good job of narrowing the field to the best candidates. Nearly as many (40%) say they have not done a good job. Eighteen percent (18%) are not sure,\u201d the poll said. The survey of 1,000 likely U.S. voters was conducted Sunday and Monday.\n\nNOW THERE\u2019S A THOUGHT\n\nThe March for Life has revealed the theme for its 2020 rally in January: \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman.\u201d This huge annual event in the nation\u2019s capital is the world\u2019s largest pro-life gathering, and has drawn as many as 650,000 people according to a New York Times account.\n\n\u201cPro-lifers should be inspired by the early suffragists who understood the true dignity of women, and that every person, born and unborn, deserves equal rights,\u201d says Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nFor the 40th consecutive week, Fox News remains the most-watched basic cable network of all throughout the day, according to Nielsen Media Research \u2014 besting such non-news competition as ESPN, HGTV and TBS. As it has for over 17 years, Fox News continues to be the top cable news network, garnering 2.8 million prime-time viewers, compared to 2 million for MSNBC and 963,000 for CNN. Presentations of \u201cHannity,\u201d \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and \u201cThe Five\u201d made up 16 of the top 40 cable telecasts in total viewers last week.\n\nIt was a good week, in fact, for prime-time anchor Laura Ingraham, who drew her highest ratings of the year last week, as did Shannon Bream, who anchors \u201cFox News @ Night\u201d at 11 p.m. nightly. Ms. Ingraham drew 4.6 million viewers, Ms. Bream had 2.5 million.\n\nFor comparison, CNN\u2019s much-vaunted five-hour long town hall during prime time last week drew 1.1 million viewers; Fox News in the same time slot averaged 3.7 million viewers.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 29% of U.S. voters would be \u201cmuch less likely\u201d to vote for their representative who favored impeaching President Trump; 61% of Republicans, 26% of independents and 5% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 29% overall voters would be \u201cmuch more likely\u201d to vote for their pro-impeachment representative; 9% of Republicans, 21% of independents and 52% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 18% overall say the impeachment vote would not influence their decision; 14% of Republicans, 23% of independents and 18% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 11% says the issue is \u201csomewhat more likely\u201d to influence their vote; 2% of Republicans, 13% of independents and 18% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 8% overall don\u2019t know; 6% of Republicans, 13% of independents and 6% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 5% said the issue is somewhat less likely\u201d to influence their vote; 9% of Republicans, 4% of independents and 2% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: A Politico/Morning Consult poll of 1,993 registered U.S. voters conducted Oct. 11-13.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
