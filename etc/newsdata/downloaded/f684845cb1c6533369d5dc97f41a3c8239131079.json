Global growth is slowing and U.S. growth is decelerating because of trade disputes and uncertainty caused by trade policy,\u201d said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer at EventShares. \u201cBut the market loves easy money, and when it gets a whiff of it, it gets high.\u201d\n\nA pivotal jobs report on Friday may contribute more evidence of whether the U.S.-China trade war is pushing the world\u2019s largest economy toward a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.47% to end at 26,201.04, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.80% to 2,910.63.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 1.12% to end the session at 7,872.27.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the S&P 500 is down about 0.5%.\n\nPepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) on Thursday rose 3% after beating quarterly expectations as higher advertising and new low-calorie versions of Gatorade boosted demand for its beverages in North America.\n\nIts shares pushed the S&P consumer staples index .SPLRCS 0.7% higher. All of the 11 major sectors rose, led by a 1.3% rise in the energy index .SPNY.\n\nCorona maker Constellation Brands Inc (STZ.N) fell 6.1% after it took an $839 million markdown in the value of its investment in pot firm Canopy Growth (WEED.TO) during the quarter.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 2, 2019.
