Before there was regime oppression and now we are getting betrayal. This is worse.\u201d\n\nShells fired by Turkish forces thudded in the distance as Rammo shuffled towards an arriving minibus, along with several dozen other Kurds jostling for seats. Like thousands of others, they were desperate to flee Qamishli, and make their way to anywhere far away from the feared Turkish onslaught.\n\nTwo days into the Turkish offensive against the Kurds in north-east Syria, the region\u2019s biggest city is shuttered and empty. Fighters and those yet to flee make up the few people left on the streets. The bus depot along a rubbish-strewn road is one of the few gathering points left in a city now at war.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Civilians flee with their belongings amid Turkish bombardment of Ras al-Ayn.

His name is Farhan Lezin. I am taking them to a safe house, as far away from here as I can.\u201d\n\n'Now the war is coming to us': Turkish towns in range of Kurdish shells Read more\n\nAnger and confusion rippled through the crowd. \u201cYou\u2019re mocking us by being here,\u201d said one man, before he squeezed inside the closing door of a departing bus. Nizamuddin Ibrahim\u2019s anger was more visceral. \u201cAfter giving 5,000 martyrs, this is how they respond to our sacrifice,\u201d the 41-year-old construction worker shouted. \u201cWe are poor people, we have nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nThen came a family from Kobane, a town at the heart of Syrian Kurdish life long before the war. Kobane was almost completely destroyed in the fighting against Isis, and was again under attack on Thursday. \u201cMany people are leaving town,\u201d said Ismael Muslim Ahmed, standing next to his pregnant wife and clutching their infant son. \u201cI\u2019d say around 40% of the people in Kobane have gone already.\n\n\u201cI was in Aleppo and my house got destroyed, when I got back to Kobane, that house was destroyed too. I\u2019m expecting it to happen a third time. The shelling has been intense.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:35 Explosions hit Syrian town of Ras al-Ayn on Turkish border \u2013 video\n\nAhmed said hundreds more fleeing Kobane had opted to drive south to the French-built Lafarge cement plant near Raqqa, from where the remnants of the US forces in the region are yet to depart. Some Kobane refugees have made their way to the base demanding that the US protect them, even as the country\u2019s commander-in-chief continues to justify his decision to order troops home.\n\nFull to the brim, the buses formed convoys along the long road to the Iraqi border, passing flatbed trucks, carrying dozens more people. They passed farmlands, scorched by the summer\u2019s intense heat, from where Kurdish forces fired mortars into nearby Turkey on Thursday afternoon. Shells flew across both sides of the border throughout the day, with the heaviest barrages landing in the town of Ras al-Ayn, where the Turkish operation was launched late on Wednesday.\n\nNearby, a Kurdish officer who called himself Lt Muzloom, was resting in a house with a dozen or so troops. \u201cYes we fired at the Turks, after they fired at us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else should we do?\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old officer claimed that Trump and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, bore equal responsibility for causing the military operation. Aid groups departed north-east Syria en masse on Thursday, before what they expect to be an expanded Turkish operation that many warn will spark a new humanitarian crisis in the region. The Red Cross has called for assurances that civilians be allowed safe passage through the combat areas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal Abyad, where Turkish forces have advanced.

That\u2019s a basic tenet of international humanitarian law,\u201d said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East.\n\n\u201cThey each feed off the other, said Muzloom, of the Turkish and US leaders. \u201cThe Americans were helping us when we were fighting Isis, and all the while they knew the Turks were turning a blind eye to them.\n\n\u201cHistory will remember our names as martyrs who defended the land. History will remember Trump\u2019s name in shame.\u201d\n\nTwo large detention centres holding tens of thousands of accused Isis members and their families are within several hours\u2019 drive of Muzloom\u2019s makeshift base. He had fought in battles against Isis across the region since the US struck a partnership with Kurdish leaders to take on the terror group. Fears that Kurds may be stretched in battle and less able to control the camps were unfounded, he claimed. \u201cWe have reserves, and we have volunteers coming, so we are not worried about that.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that Ankara was attempting to drive divisions between Arabs and Kurds, who have long coexisted in north-east Syria. Erdo\u011fan has said he wants Syrian Arab refugees in Turkey sent back across the border for settlement in new \u201csafe zones\u201d, to be carved out by Turkey\u2019s military operation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with the Arabs,\u201d said Muzloom. \u201cThe Turks want to open a gap between us. We can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Mohammed Rasool\n\n", "description": "As they seek safety away from Turkish shells, Syrian Kurds burn with anger at Donald Trump\u2019s betrayal", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/154b8c8d06a023a5ff4af1e0fac0464bdeee3982/350_705_4672_2803/master/4672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=59eb49ffc324e8a208d874ef56555521", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
