I didn\u2019t have any business relationship or friendship with him. I didn\u2019t go to New Mexico or Florida or Palm Beach or any of that,\u201d Gates told the Journal. \u201cThere were people around him who were saying, hey, if you want to raise money for global health and get more philanthropy, he knows a lot of rich people.\n\n\u201cEvery meeting where I was with him were meetings with men. I was never at any parties or anything like that. He never donated any money to anything that I know about,\u201d Gates added.\n\nEpstein and Gates first met in person, according to the Times, on Jan. 31, 2011, at Epstein's Upper East Side townhouse. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a former Miss Sweden who had once dated Epstein, was also in attendance with her 15-year-old daughter for the gathering, which lasted several hours. (Andersson-Dubin and her husband, Glenn Dubin\u2014a friend and business partner of Epstein's\u2014declined to comment on the Times story.)
