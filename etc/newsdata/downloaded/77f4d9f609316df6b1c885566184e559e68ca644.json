We spent several years reporting this out, extensively fact-checking it, what we show in this book with a paper trail, with documents, is that there were multiple secret settlements and non-disclosures being struck with women at NBC News,\u201d Farrow said Friday on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\n\"GMA\" host George Stephanopoulos asked if the settlements were \u201cafter the fact,\u201d as NBC honchos have insisted.\n\n\u201cNope. Years before, over a period of six to seven years. A period in which NBC had previously denied any settlements. There were seven non-disclosure agreements. Multiples ones of those were with Matt Lauer accusers,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cThis is years before this incident with [Lauer\u2019s rape accuser] Brooke Nevils and the firing.\u201d\n\nMATT LAUER BREAKS SILENCE ON RAPE ACCUSATION: READ HIS LETTER HERE\n\nFarrow added that he spoke with senior executives at NBC who were well aware of the clandestine settlements. \u201cThis was a company with a lot of secrets,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, an NBC News spokesperson countered Farrow's Lauer claims.\n\n\"The first time we learned about Matt Lauer's sexual misconduct in the workplace was the night of November 27, 2017 and he was fired in 24 hours. Any suggestion that we knew prior to that evening, paid any 'hush money,' or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer's appalling behavior is absolutely false,\" the statement read. \"NBCU's legal team has done an exhaustive search of available records and conducted dozens of interviews of past and present staff, and uncovered no claims or settlements relating to allegations of inappropriate conduct by Matt Lauer that pre-date his firing. Only following his termination did we reach agreements with two women who had come forward for the very first time and those women have always been free to share their stories about Lauer with anyone they choose.\"\n\nFarrow, a former NBC News reporter, also says the network stopped him from exposing now-disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein as a sexual predator. NBC News claimed his reporting wasn\u2019t fit to print, so instead Farrow famously took his Pulitzer Prize-winning piece to The New Yorker and helped launch the #MeToo movement.\n\nHis book reveals his side of the story behind why NBC News seemingly protected Weinstein, who reportedly leveraged NBC executives with scandalous information regarding Lauer \u2013 who was the Peacock Network\u2019s biggest star before his own skeletons emerged.\n\nA former high-level NBC News staffer tells Fox News that the organization has a history of problematic leadership that extends well before Farrow\u2019s revelations.\n\nLAUER\u2019S OFFICE SEXCAPADES KNOWN TO MEDIA ELITES, WHO ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OVER LEWD JOKES AT 2008 \u2018ROAST\u2019\n\n\u201cHistorically the place has always been a noxious and unrepentant boys' club \u2013 Michael Gartner, Dick Ebersol when he oversaw \u2018Today,\u2019 Jeff Zucker, Steve Capus and the worst of them all, Andy Lack,\u201d the former staffer told Fox News. \u201cWoe to any woman who seeks to thrive there.\u201d\n\nLack has managed to cling to his high-paid gig amid a series of embarrassing scandals, including a variety of accusations about his own alleged affairs. The New York Post\u2019s Page Six obtained an excerpt of Farrow\u2019s book, which cites an alleged victim who claims that the NBC News chairman \u201cpreyed on female underlings and pursued sexual relationships with them\u201d throughout his career.\n\nLack\u2019s top deputy, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim, was mocked by his own staff on Thursday when he attempted to justify the way the network has handled sexual misconduct scandals.\n\n\u201cNoah sat there and lied to our faces again. He wants credit for taking our questions but is still dodging. I feel like he\u2019s gaslighting us,\u201d an NBC source told Fox News.\n\nNBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM\n\nHours after Oppenheim was embarrassed by his team, The Daily Beast reported Thursday night that 30 Rock staffers circulated a column their boss wrote for the school newspaper when he attended Harvard University that shines a new light on his character.\n\nOppenheim \u201cmocked feminists, gushed over busty blondes, and lambasted NBC for firing a sportscaster accused of sexual assault,\u201d according to the Beast. \u201cSeveral staffers have passed around his columns, expressing outrage.\u201d\n\nOne of Oppenheim\u2019s former colleagues told the Beast that \u201cNoah has always run a boys\u2019 club,\u201d but it\u2019s hardly the first time that phrase was used to describe NBC News. A 2018 Esquire feature titled, \u201cThe Peacock Patriarchy,\u201d detailed how it \u201chad long operated as a kind of boys\u2019 club in which such peccadilloes and intraoffice flings were swept under the rug.\u201d\n\nEsquire\u2019s David Usborne wrote that many of \u201cthe same NBC executives who\u2019d professed shock at Lauer\u2019s behavior\u201d were in attendance at the 2008 Friars Club roast which left little doubt that Lauer\u2019s colleagues knew NBC\u2019s biggest star had a troubled marriage and a wandering eye.\n\nNBC NEWS BOSS ANDY LACK\u2019S LEADERSHIP SCRUTINIZED AS RONAN FARROW TELL-ALL APPROACHES\n\n\u201cMatt was having some trouble at home with the wife,\u201d then-NBC boss and current CNN president Jeff Zucker said at the roast. \u201cIt\u2019s just good to see Matt up here and not under my desk.\u201d\n\nZucker added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say Matt is a germophobe, but he\u2019s the only guy I know who uses Purell both before and after he masturbates.\u201d\n\nThe men of NBC News aren\u2019t the only people culpable for the network\u2019s boys' club culture, according to former NBC correspondent Linda Vester.\n\nVester, who has accused NBC News legend Tom Brokaw of sexual misconduct (a claim he denies), is angry that Lack\u2019s unit didn\u2019t thoroughly investigate her claim. She feels that changes won\u2019t be made until the Peacock Network\u2019s high-powered women speak out.\n\nCNN, MSNBC IGNORE MATT LAUER RAPE ALLEGATIONS, NBC SCANDAL DURING PRIME TIME\n\n\u201cI think that Mika [Brzezinski], Rachel Maddow, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb should all be using the power that they have as highly paid anchors to push NBC to investigate all of the high-profile alleged harassers who are still walking the halls of the newsroom,\u201d Vester recently told Fox News. \u201cThey make a lot of money and they should use that bully pulpit, that power, to make NBC do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThe list of chauvinistic scandals at NBC News in recent memory is quite lengthy, as the network refused to enlist an outside investigator to determine who knew about Lauer\u2019s misconduct, sat on the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women, and reportedly had high-profile hosts try to help disgraced political host Mark Halperin revive his career after being fired from MSNBC amid sexual misconduct claims, in addition to all the Weinstein-related issues and claims against Lack himself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, things haven\u2019t been as favorable for some women at NBC News.
