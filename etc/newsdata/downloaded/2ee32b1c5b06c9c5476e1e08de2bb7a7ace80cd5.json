Here are 10 experiences not to miss out on during a trip.\n\nKing of the castle\n\nLjubljana Castle towers above the city on its own hilltop \u2013 presumably the very thing that made it an attractive place for a fortress in the first place. Although there\u2019s a funicular to take visitors there and back, if you\u2019ve got a spring in your step, hike up the well-signed path through the woods instead. You\u2019ll find phenomenal 360-degree views atop the viewing tower, a \u201cvirtual castle\u201d film showing the building\u2019s history, a chapel and penitentiary exhibit, plus two onsite museums and a restaurant overlooking the city. Open June to September 9am-9pm; shorter opening hours the remainder of the year. Entry \u20ac13 (\u00a312) (includes return funicular journey) or free with a Ljubljana card (as are most other activities included in this piece).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nStand up and paddle\n\nSee the city from the Ljubljanica river\u2019s blue-green waters on a stand-up paddle boarding (SUP) excursion with Bananaway. Participants can choose from an \u201curban\u201d SUP tour, which takes them through the heart of the city, or an \u201cinto the wild\u201d SUP tour, which heads away from town, winding up in the countryside within a five-minute paddle. All equipment, guides and introduction to SUP included. (Just be warned \u2013 if it\u2019s raining tours may be called off.) Two-hour tour: \u20ac39pp.\n\nFollow the moustaches\n\nLaunched a year ago, the quirky Moustache Tour takes visitors on a journey all around the city, framed through the lives of Ljubljana\u2019s three most prominent men with facial hair: Joze Plecnik (architect), Ivan Cankar (writer) and Rihard Jakopic (artist). In this whirlwind bike tour, you get to see some of the city\u2019s best attractions, drink a hot tea with rum and even get a free, snazzy moustache T-shirt. The price of \u20ac45 includes bike rental, tour guide, a drink and cake and brief entry into six attractions. Runs every Friday at 3pm, lasting three to four hours.\n\nSnap a weird selfie\n\nLooking for an hour of the bizarre? The Museum of Illusions is as fun as it is ridiculous, offering a host of interactive exhibitions over three floors, many of which are set up to be captured on your smartphone. It finishes up with a mind-bending vortex tunnel and a range of brain-busting puzzles to remind you why Mensa never pursued you for membership. Open Monday to Friday, 8am-4pm; entry \u20ac9.50.\n\nWe heart art\n\nHit up the Museum of Modern Art, a genuinely lovely space to do some chin stroking and art appreciation. It\u2019s dedicated to Slovenian contemporary art from the 20th century and features a natty cafe in the basement. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10am-6pm; entry \u20ac5.\n\nElsewhere, the International Centre of Graphic Arts sits in a gorgeous location in Tivoli Park, displaying the largest Slovenian collection of modern fine-art prints and original publications \u2013 it houses more than 10,000 pieces. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10am-6pm; entry \u20ac5.\n\nEat a gut-busting delicacy\n\nStruklji \u2013 hefty baked rolls of filo pastry \u2013 are a true Slovenian favourite. They come in sweet or savoury varieties, packed with different flavours between the layers of dough and topped with breadcrumbs. Tarragon is typical, but make sure you follow it up with a dessert struklji such as raspberry or blueberry.\n\nDown the hatch\n\nFor a home-grown beer, swing by Union next to Tivoli park. It\u2019s on the site of the 155-year-old Union brewery and some of the libations they serve can\u2019t be found anywhere else in the city. Don\u2019t miss out on the brewery tour \u2013 the 90-minute experience is brilliant, taking you through the entire beer-making process with generous servings of Union lager and amber beer along the way; \u20ac14.\n\nWalk in the park\n\nTivoli Park is Ljubljana\u2019s biggest, spanning a whopping 5sq km. Designed in 1813 by French engineer Jean Blanchard, it was created by joining together the parks surrounding Podturn and Cekin Mansions.\n\nThese days, it draws locals and visitors alike with horse chestnut tree-lined walks, landscaped ornamental flower beds, outdoor galleries and numerous statues and fountains. There are several trails for hiking and the park also encompasses Roznik hill, atop of which stands the jaunty pink 18th-century Church of the Visitation and a shrine to famous Slovenian writer Ivan Canker.\n\nGrab some street food\n\nOpen Kitchen \u2013 a collection of stalls showcasing cuisine from some of the city\u2019s best restaurants \u2013 happens every Friday in Pogacar Square. Buy street food from top Slovenian chefs to a soundtrack of live music. Open from mid-March to October, weather permitting.\n\nBecome a spy\n\nJust a 40-minute drive from the city are two hard-hitting attractions in one place: the famed Postojna Cave and the neighbouring The Secret Rooms of Hotel Jama, a new experience for this year. The latter is a fun interactive tour of a hidden communication centre dating back to when the country was part of the former Yugoslavia, uncovered while the hotel was being renovated in 2016. Led by a guide who hams up the secret service element, the experience is high-tech and truly immersive. Be warned: the walls have ears. Tours last 90 minutes and cost \u20ac25.", "description": "The Slovenian capital may be compact, but that doesn\u2019t stop\u00a0leafy, pretty Ljubljana from packing a punch when it comes to things\u00a0to see and do.
