USA TODAY\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned about the Los Angeles Rams the last three years, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t believe in \u201csafe.\u201d\n\n\u201cConservative\u201d also has no place in the vocabularies of general manager Les Snead and team president Kevin Demoff. In two aggressive offseasons, they overhauled a once-feeble roster, giving coach Sean McVay the pieces to contend for a Super Bowl. They made more moves last offseason, hoping that the franchise can avoid the dreaded Super Bowl hangover.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 decision-makers are proven wheelers-and-dealers. They\u2019ll ship off premium picks for established veterans. They\u2019ll open the checkbook to pay big-name free agents and re-sign their own to record extensions.\n\nSo, it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise when the Rams sprang into action once again on Tuesday. They shipped Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters to the Baltimore Ravens, then turned around and acquired an even more talented defensive back in Jalen Ramsey from Jacksonville.\n\nThe Jaguars\u2019 asking price of two first-round picks scared off many teams, but not the Rams, who also threw in a fourth-rounder for good measure. They felt the need for game-changing remedy at cornerback where Peters has yielded big plays with greater frequency, and where Aqib Talib is headed for injured reserve with a rib injury.\n\nBut because of the current state of the Rams \u2014 losers of three straight for the first time under McVay, with the two most recent defeats coming to NFC West rivals Seattle and San Francisco, and with injuries mounting \u2014 the Ramsey acquisition smacks of desperation.\n\nUnder different circumstances, this would have been classified as yet another aggressive and gutsy move by the Rams\u2019 brain trust.\n\nBut those losses did happen, and they were preceded by an embarrassing debacle at L.A. Coliseum in which the Rams\u2019 defense allowed the same Jameis Winston, who threw five interceptions on Sunday against the Carolina Panthers, to torch them for four touchdown passes in a 55-40 upset.\n\nJalen Ramsey is a two-time Pro Bowl selection.

But it\u2019s impossible to deny that the pressure certainly is mounting. The Rams are 3-3 and the division has gotten better around them. San Francisco boasts a 5-0 record and Seattle a 5-1 mark. Blessed largely with good health the last two seasons, the team now suddenly has an ever-expanding injury report, and it features some of their most prominent players.\n\nRams officials know that while this window of opportunity to contend for supremacy in this league opened quickly, it will close in similar fashion.\n\nHaving spent generously both to bring in more talent and retain stars like Todd Gurley, Jared Goff and Aaron Donald \u2014 making each among the highest-paid players at their positions \u2014 the Rams now own the third-highest payroll in the league. And there\u2019s only so much time before salary cap restrictions will prohibit them from acquiring top-level pieces at a similarly aggressive pace.\n\nAnd on top of that, the Rams still are trying to win over a fan base in a city that\u2019s long been considered a college football town. Despite their success in 2017 and 2018, the seats of L.A. Coliseum still feature a large number of out-of-town fans rather than an overwhelming home crowd. The Rams, along with their L.A. step-sister Chargers, are opening a new $5 billion stadium next summer, and team architects know that the best way to prevail in the war for L.A. and pack out that stadium with their own fans is to win now, win big and win consistently.\n\nA return to the Super Bowl, and winning it, would go a long way to helping the Rams further establish themselves in the city.\n\nThat\u2019s why with Talib hurt and Peters struggling, they felt pressure to make this move for Ramsey.\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the situation, the team had a degree of interest in the fourth-year cornerback weeks ago when he made his initial trade request. However, Jaguars ownership really didn\u2019t want to trade Ramsey (the fifth overall pick of the 2016 draft) and placed a high asking price on him.\n\nThe Rams initially hesitated, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak on the matter. But when Talib got hurt, and with Baltimore willing to take Peters off their hands, the Rams felt like it was time to make a move.\n\nBut the Ramsey acquisition does come with risks.\n\nAlthough regarded by many as the best corner in the game, Ramsey has not played at that same elite level this season because of injuries. Critics suspected that he sat out the last three games as a move to expedite his exit from Jacksonville. But the back injury is indeed real.\n\nThe Rams hope that Ramsey can quickly regain full health so he can give them a proper return on their investment.\n\nBut then there\u2019s this: Ramsey comes to L.A. with only 1 1/2 years left on his contract and there\u2019s no guarantee that he sticks around for the long-term.\n\nAlthough he has this season and next year\u2019s fifth-year option on his rookie contract remaining, Ramsey reported for training camp in search of a long-term contract from Jacksonville that would have made him the highest-paid cornerback in the league. He still wants that big pay day, however, according to a person familiar with his thinking, he\u2019s unsure about signing a multi-year deal with the Rams. He would prefer to keep his options open while evaluating the best situation for his family.\n\nOn top of Ramsey\u2019s uncertainty, the Rams also might not have the money to keep him because they also need to re-sign other key players like pass rusher Dante Fowler Jr. and Michael Brockers.\n\nThe Rams might have paid two premium picks for a 1 1/2-year rental. However, the team\u2019s decision-makers deemed the acquisition a risk worth taking.\n\nIf healthy, Ramsey certainly upgrades L.A.\u2019s secondary. But he can\u2019t help cure Gurley\u2019s ailing quad and ongoing knee issue. He can't fortify a line that\u2019s struggling with chemistry and performance issues following the offseason departures of guard Rodger Saffold and center John Sullivan. And he can\u2019t help Goff get his groove back.\n\nThat laundry list still needs addressing by McVay, Snead and Demoff. But, roughly two weeks remain before the NFL\u2019s trade deadline. As Tuesday showed, the Rams have no problem taking risks, so the blockbuster move for Ramsey might represent only the start of another aggressive push.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
