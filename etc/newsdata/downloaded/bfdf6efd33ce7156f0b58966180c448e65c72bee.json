(Tyrone Siu/Reuters)\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Friday invoked rarely used emergency powers to ban face masks at demonstrations, a move that her government believes will quell months-long and increasingly violent protests in the city \u2014 but which have already had the opposite effect of intensifying anger on city streets.\n\nThe decision risks prolonging the unrest that has rocked the city and will effectively expand police powers of arrest amid widespread fear that the department is operating with impunity. It could also risk tainting Hong Kong\u2019s hard-fought reputation as an open financial hub, already under strain over the upheaval of recent months.\n\n\u201cProtests are all over Hong Kong, across the territory,\u201d Lam said in a news conference, flanked by a range of ministers including secretaries for securities and justice. \u201cThe violence is destroying Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the current situation in Hong Kong, this is a necessary decision,\u201d she said.\n\nLam added that while the emergency ordinance is being enacted to ban the masks, Hong Kong itself is not in a state of emergency.\n\nThe ban will take effect from Saturday.\n\nCritics were quick to reject the measure and the emergency laws as a slippery slope.\n\n\u201cHong Kong authorities should be working to create a political environment in which protesters do not feel the need for masks \u2014 not banning the masks, and deepening restrictions on freedom of expression,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe measure has been pushed by a more hardcore group of Beijing loyalists within Lam\u2019s government, who have accused her of being too soft on the unrest roiling the city.\n\nRead more\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The announcement has already provoked a fresh wave of anger on Hong Kong\u2019s streets, and critics say it represents an erosion of the territory\u2019s freedoms.", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani", "Reporter Covering Southeast Asia", "Hong Kong", "Timothy Mclaughlin", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RmektS20f_2coBEeilgXNioUEy0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GGPGW6XGPAI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
