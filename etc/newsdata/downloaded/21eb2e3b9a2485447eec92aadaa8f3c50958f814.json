There are yet to be discussions on putting a time limit on such an arrangement but some EU sources have suggested Dublin could be put under pressure to accept such a deal if it was clear that the Commons would accept it.\n\nThe more likely outcome, EU sources suggested, was that there would not be a deal and that the UK would be seeking an extension to its membership beyond 31 October.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be his last plan,\u201d said one senior source close to the negotiations. \u201cIt is unworkable to dissociate customs from the regulatory regime. No point in even considering a time limit on something that is not workable.\u201d\n\nA second diplomatic source added: \u201cAt least he didn\u2019t say in the speech it was his final offer. So we\u2019ll be listening very carefully to see if there\u2019s scope to bring it back somewhere reasonable.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, will formally present the UK\u2019s legal text on the Irish border to the European commission later on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe prime minister is expected to make a series of calls to EU leaders, including the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in the hope that there can be a period of intensive engagement on his proposals before a crunch summit on 17 October.\n\nThere are, however, grave doubts about Johnson\u2019s sincerity in wanting a deal and suspicion that the UK is engaging in \u201cblame game management\u201d ahead of a general election.\n\n'A load of nonsense\u2019: readers on Johnson\u2019s speech Read more\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, told reporters he was concerned by the UK\u2019s direction of travel.\n\nHe said: \u201cEssentially, if he\u2019s proposing customs checks on the island of Ireland I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the basis of an agreement. But let\u2019s wait and see the detail on that before we make a full judgment on it.\n\n\u201cIf there is a proposal that involves customs checks on the island of Ireland, that in itself is bad faith given the commitments the British government has given both to Ireland and the EU over the last three years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. Obviously we\u2019ll study any proposal carefully, but if the reports are true it doesn\u2019t look like the basis of an agreement, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d", "description": "Brussels takes heart from PM stopping short of \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 Brexit statement", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4a42faf7a08b48bc34915f6362b13a90d7e2a2/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eeb0df6b1636b9849f8e9c9ced7cb514"}
