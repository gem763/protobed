Warren", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nElizabeth Warren is on the way to securing the Democrat nomination, and the ensuing general election battle will be a re-run of Little Bighorn except, ironically, Sitting Bolshevik will be Custer. Trump\u2019s going to drag her kicking and screaming and nagging, always nagging, down the trail of tears until that glorious November night when Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and maybe Minnesota all express their reservations over sending this tiresome scold to the White Wigwam in Washington.\n\nOh, are you a True Conservative\u2122 who gets the sadz at this Mohican mockery? Too bad, you sissy submissives \u2013 you have not seen the last of it. Not by a long shot. We battlecons are never going to get tired of rubbing her cheesy ethnic appropriation in her pale face, nor will Donald Trump. Soon Not-Senile Joe will be out of the way \u2013 and yeah, rickety polling aside, in part thanks to Trump\u2019s Ukrainian briar-patch play Hairplug One is headed for the unhappy hunting grounds. And once he\u2019s gone, the Bad Orange Man is going to start pounding Hackagawea and he\u2019s not gonna stop until he\u2019s secured four more years.\n\nBut it\u2019s not moderately amusing tribe jibes that are going to do in her candidacy. Elizabeth Warren faces some other challenging obstacles on her way to the Oval Office. Foremost among them is Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWhere Kirstin Gillibrand came across as America\u2019s First Wife, Warren comes across as that irritating middle school librarian who is constantly demanding that we all use our inside voices and who puts up posters that say \u201cReading Is Cool!\u201d with a picture of the Fonz. Functionaries like that are just fine for keeping seventh graders from burning down the school and for passing out tomes so the kids can learn them their cypherin\u2019, but grown men and women neither need nor want some National Nag pestering them to be better people. For one thing, we\u2019re already manifestly better than the cast of weirdos, losers and pinko mutations that make up Warren\u2019s motley base.\n\nAt least Joe Biden seems to know how to deal with normal people, or at least he did before he began his Botox\u2019d strange-o act over the last few months. Regardless, the regular guy act was always a front \u2013 the real Joe Biden is just another DC insider who plowed the field for his ultra-achiever son Snortie to occupy a seat on some Ukrainian oligarch\u2019s gas company at north of 50K a month when he wasn\u2019t face-planted in a heap of Bolivia\u2019s Best and/or working his bro\u2019s widow.\n\nBut at least Gropey J could fake being a guy you might conceivably have a beer with. When Warren starts talking about having a beer it's enough to make you give up drinking. She makes me repelled by the thought of a cold, frosty brew \u2013 cold turkey inspired by a cold turkey. This is not a great candidate.\n\nAnd she\u2019s from Massachusetts, for Pete\u2019s sake. For 50-plus years, the state with the Dropkick Murphy\u2019s soundtrack has produced a non-stop series of electoral losers. Mike Dukakis? He managed to lose because someone told him he\u2019d look butch in a tank. John Kerry. Sheesh, he managed to lose to W. Oh, and who can forget Mitt Romney? That Irish Setter-tormenting Fredocon nerd managed to lose to Candy Crowley even before he lost to Barack \u201cI Bought a Mansion by the Seashore Because Climate Change Is a Hoax\u201d Obama. The last guy from Boston who pulled it off was JFK, but at least he had scoring with Marilyn Monroe going for him.\n\nMaybe the Democrat base thinks that after losing with their last unlikeable shrew, the shrews are due. But Elizabeth Warren is so uniquely unlikeable to Normal Americans \u2013 you know, ones who don\u2019t wander about blue coastal cities introducing themselves with their pronouns \u2013 that this would be a McGovernesque rout if states like California, New York and the cold one up in the corner with the maple syrup weren\u2019t so full of idiots. The fight is going to come down to a handful of states that liberals typically fly over and that are filled with people liberals despise. You know, the people who actually do the work that keeps us warm, fed and safe\u2026the enemies of the Democrat Party.\n\nIt says a lot that the fact Big Chief Warren taught at Harvard \u2013 albeit solely because of her Apache-at scam \u2013 is not the thing that will alienate her most from Midwestern voters. It\u2019s her insane catering to the commie contingent in her midst. It\u2019s one thing to try to get to the left of the Democrat field during the primaries; it\u2019s another to get to the left of the Democrat field during the primaries when you\u2019re running against Bernie Sanders.\n\nOpen borders? Check.\n\nConfiscate your guns? Check.\n\nRaise your taxes? Check.\n\nTake your doctor? Check.\n\nAbortion until the kid can draw his Social Security? Check.\n\nThese are not the positions a serious contender outside of a Brooklyn coffeehouse or an Ivy league faculty lounge adopts.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s her promise to ban fracking. Hear that, all you voters in Western PA and thereabouts? Because she chose the weird weather cultists over you, you get to tell your families that instead of your six-figure jobs helping America be energy independent you all get to be impoverished again. But hey, ruining your lives is a small price to pay for the smug satisfaction our elite liberal betters will get knowing they pleased Gaia\u2019s pig-tailed earthy manifestation Greta Thunberg.\n\nHmmmm. Your livelihoods or the catering to the obsessions of a Swedish 16-year-old? Hey, for Liz Warren that\u2019s an easy call! Better learn to code!\n\nActually, don\u2019t bother. Elizabeth Warren may get nominated \u2013 in fact, it looks like she will. But when she and her running mate \u2013 be it the gun-grabbing furry, Willie Brown\u2019s fling or Mayor Liberal Lithgow from Footloose, Indiana \u2013 enter the general, Trump will be waiting.\n\nHe\u2019s got money, oodles of it.\n\nHe\u2019s got results, among them that we all have more money (and jobs and no new wars).\n\nAnd he\u2019s got the killer instinct to scalp the competition.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that for the sake of a viable two-party system, this will be the Democrat Party\u2019s radical left\u2019s last stand.\n\nIf you want to read a vivid account of what happens if America is dumb enough to elect Karla Marx president, check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire They are the kind of books that make ex-Weekly Standard writers cry, but then so do spiders, clowns and seeing people do push-ups.
