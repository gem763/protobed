Panicked aides bundled him back into the car as police pinned down the suspect.\n\nWiranto sustained two stab wounds to his stomach and is conscious and in a stable condition, doctors said. An aide, a police officer and a university employee were also injured. A husband and wife have been arrested in relation to the attack.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, the suspicion from Banten police is the man is likely to have been exposed to Isis radicalism while the woman is still being investigated,\u201d said the national police spokesman, Dedi Prasetyo.\n\nWiranto was named security minister in 2016 and wields significant power in Indonesian politics. In recent months he has overseen the government response to a series of rolling protests in West Papua.\n\nThe controversial former general headed the Indonesian military during the occupation of East Timor and while he has never stood trial stands accused of human rights abuses. As chief security minister, Wiranto oversees five ministries including foreign, interior and defence.\n\nIndonesia, which is the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country, is grappling with a resurgence in militancy. The government scrambled to tighten its anti-terrorism laws after a series of suicide bombings linked to the Isis-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah group killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya last year.\n\nHundreds of people have been detained under the new laws since the beginning of 2019.\n\nReuters contributed to this report", "description": "Retired army general Wiranto sustained two stab wounds to stomach and is in stable condition", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1e8aed42e2a0cb80149fa7faef374e967cbd36e/0_116_3483_2090/master/3483.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7aae058701f59eb7009f9990da05893a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
