Second, the U.N. should ensure that Taiwan has the right to participate in an equal and dignified manner in meetings, mechanisms and activities related to the implementation of the U.N.

Neglecting this population is a gross violation of the universality of membership principles that the United Nations upholds. Taiwan\u2019s people deserve better than this. Taiwan\u2019s strong position in the world is underpinned by its thriving democracy, its economic prowess and its attractive social values.
