The dispute remains over the salaries of the families of #prisoners and #martyrs. We are determined to pay their dues at all costs,\" al-Sheikh said on Twitter, referencing the funds that Israel is still deducting from PA transfers.\n\n'Pay for slay'?\n\nIn February, Israel announced it would cut by five percent the approximately $190m in tax revenues it transfers to the PA each month from imports that reach the occupied West Bank and the Hamas-run Gaza Strip via Israeli ports.\n\nThe deducted sum represents the amount of money paid by the PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, to families of Palestinians convicted and jailed by Israel for security offences, including deadly attacks on Israelis.\n\nThe tax transfers make up about half of the PA's budget, according to Palestinian finance ministry data.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has since February refused to accept the partial tax remittances from Israel, saying the PA is entitled to all the money under interim peace deals.\n\nIsrael calls the stipends a \"pay for slay\" policy and says it encourages violence. Meanwhile, Palestinians hail their jailed brethren as heroes in the struggle for an independent state and say their families are deserving of support.\n\nThe United States passed legislation last year to sharply reduce aid to the PA unless it stopped the payouts, and the administration of US President Donald Trump last year cut hundreds of millions of dollars of aid.\n\nIn August, Israel agreed to withhold less Palestinian tax money, allowing the PA to collect fuel taxes directly - a move that partially eased Palestinian financial concerns.\n\nAnalysts have warned that chronic financial problems raise the risk of violence erupting in the occupied West Bank.", "description": "Deal between PA and Israeli ministers seems to ease Ramallah's financial woes, though prisoner stipend dispute remains.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/3e53c6f34c4a46f8909a597569bccb44_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
