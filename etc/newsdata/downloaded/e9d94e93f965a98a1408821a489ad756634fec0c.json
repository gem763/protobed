It\u2019s 1910, and you\u2019re wandering around Melbourne\u2019s notorious red-light district. It\u2019s part historical adventure, part mystery \u2013 if you play in Melbourne, you\u2019ll get to visit heritage sites where actual events went down, but you can also play it anywhere in the world (just without the IRL locations being involved, obviously).\n\nThe game sees you play the role of detective, as you investigate a series of clashes in Little Lon which led to Ernest Gunter\u2019s demise. Was Gunter hit in an unprovoked attack, or did he attack a member of the terrifying Bourke Street Rat associates? Who is lying and who is telling the truth? That\u2019s for you to decide.\n\nThe first five scenes can be enjoyed via a free trial, and then it\u2019s just $4.99 to buy the game. Which is cheaper than a large coffee if you add all the weird milks, so honestly this is a no-brainer. It takes two hours to play and you\u2019ll walk for around 3km, which is also great exercise.\n\nKeen? Misadventure In Little Lon is available on the App Store or Google Play, and there\u2019s a few techy things like needing some AR download that I don\u2019t understand, so definitely read the info before you pay $$$. Here\u2019s the site for all the details!", "description": "True crime augmented reality game 'Misadventure In Little Lon' lets you wander the streets of Melbourne, but in 1910 as you try to solve a murder.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-9.25.52-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
