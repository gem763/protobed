And by interesting, I mean the whole Trump impeachment circus looks like more of a joke with every passing day. We all know what got us here. President Trump had a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. There was supposedly some quid pro quo nonsense, with Trump threatening to withhold military aid unless Ukraine opened a corruption probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s position at an energy company; Biden has zero experience in the energy sector. He\u2019s also the son of former Vice President and 2020 candidate Joe Biden. The allegation is that Hunter sat on the board selling access. Is there truth to it? All we know is that Joe gets very, very upset when people talk about it.\n\nThe White House released a transcript of the call. There was no quid pro quo. There was nothing illegal. This came about because some whistleblower, who is reportedly a CIA agent, heard some other people say that this call was felonious in nature. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s based on second-hand accounts. It\u2019s fraught with errors. And this person was cited for political bias against Trump. This person is also a registered Democrat, but beyond that, we now know that this person worked with a 2020 Democrat (via Washington Examiner):\n\nIn an Aug. 26 letter, the Intelligence Community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, wrote that the anonymous whistleblower who set off the Trump-Ukraine impeachment fight showed \"some indicia of an arguable political bias ... in favor of a rival political candidate.\" A few weeks later, news reports said the whistleblower's possible bias was that he is a registered Democrat. That was all. Incredulous commentary suggested that Republicans who were pushing the bias talking point were so blinded by their own partisanship that they saw simple registration with the Democratic Party as evidence of wrongdoing. \"Give me a break!\" tweeted whistleblower lawyer Mark Zaid. \"Bias? Seriously?\" Now, however, there is word of more evidence of possible bias on the whistleblower's part. Under questioning from Republicans during last Friday's impeachment inquiry interview with Atkinson, the inspector general revealed that the whistleblower's possible bias was not that he was simply a registered Democrat. It was that he had a significant tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates currently vying to challenge President Trump in next year's election. \"The IG said [the whistleblower] worked or had some type of professional relationship with one of the Democratic candidates,\" said one person with knowledge of what was said. \"The IG said the whistleblower had a professional relationship with one of the 2020 candidates,\" said another person with knowledge of what was said.\n\nThe sources are not named, so as with anything relating to anonymous sources, let\u2019s wait and see. At the same time, are we shocked? The Left has been gunning to impeach Trump since 2016. Yes, there is a deep state of liberal activist government workers seeking to make things as difficult as possible for this administration. The Democrats couldn\u2019t get Trump on their Russian collusion nonsense. The Mueller report shot that theory dead. This was the Left\u2019s best hope to get Trump and now they\u2019re using some phone call to rehash many of the same talking points in order to get the president. You all knew this would look silly if the Democrats tried to weaponize Russian collusion. Now, they\u2019re trying to make something out of this Ukraine thing, where the only notable characteristics are that the Democrats are desperate, politically motivated, and using selective evidence to execute an impeachment inquiry.", "description": ".10/08/2019 20:20:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/280/b8a2fc66-5fdd-4dc7-8cf5-60d58e7eb599.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
