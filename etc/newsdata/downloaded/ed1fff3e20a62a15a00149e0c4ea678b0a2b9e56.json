The United States will welcome an affirmative #EUCO decision, recognizing both countries\u2019 hard fought gains on necessary reforms.\u201d\n\n.@eucopresident Tusk has it right: the time to open accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia is now.

This mistake isn\u2019t so different from some of the mistakes @realdonaldtrump has made recently. \u2014 Alexander Soros, PhD (@AlexanderSoros) October 18, 2019\n\nResponding to a request from Breitbart London, a senior department official said: \u201cWe talk about sovereignty and decisions. We\u2019re for countries making their choice in the institutions that they choose to join. We\u2019re not going to tell them to join one or another.\n\n\u201cThe people of North Macedonia have voted in a referendum to take certain steps toward this kind of integration. These are countries that want to be in the EU, and the UK has made its own decision, voting through a referendum to leave.\u201d\n\nThe denial of a dual-speed foreign policy \u2014 led by a President sceptical of the supranational on one hand and a State Department embracing it on the other \u2014 comes as Washington swamp insider publication of choice Politico splashed on State Department officials \u201ctaking their revenge\u201d on the White House. Noting criticisms including the Department being \u201cderided as a Deep State\u201d and being stuffed with \u201cObama holdovers\u201d by its critics, the Politico report stated staffers \u201cdemoted or sidelined\u201d in the Trump era were using Ukraine allegation testimonies to \u201cair long-held grievances\u201d.\n\nThe report reproduced the remarks of former U.S. ambassador Laura Kennedy who said of the feelings towards Trump foreign policy in the State Department in 2019: \u201cPeople are fed up\u2026 There\u2019s a deep well of resentment that\u2019s just bubbled toward the top.\u201d\n\nEU President: Trump Not \u2018Tuned in\u2019 to \u2018Strong, United\u2019 Europe, Claims Nationalism a \u2018Fundamental Threat\u2019 https://t.co/h0riuyjK57 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 12, 2018\n\nPresident Trump has clearly been cool on globalist-minded supranational bodies like the European Union, which has clashed with his administration on foreign policy and trade, repeatedly praising the people of the United Kingdom for voting to withdraw from the European Union.\n\nUndermining the suggestion he supports European expansionism are comments such as his 2017 interview with The Times newspaper when President Trump made clear that in contrast to the values and future being pursued by the political leadership in Brussels, the people of Europe \u201cwant their own identity\u201d and he believed other nations would follow Britain and leave the European Union in time.\n\nIndeed, as recently as September, the President told the United Nations: \u201cThe future does not belong to globalists, the future belongs to patriots, the future belongs to sovereign and independent nations.\u201d\n\nWhile the State Department insists it respects the sovereignty of North Macedonia, understanding the extent to which the European Union itself has respect for its would-be newest member is murky at best. Long-time EU member Greece has used the Union to wage a vendetta against its northern neighbour for decades, insisting North Macedonia not be referred to by its own chosen name of \u2018Macedonia\u2019 but be called the \u2018Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia\u2019, eventually succeeding in making the formal name change to \u2018North Macedonia\u2019 a condition of EU membership.\n\nWhile this was widely reported to have been a humiliating blow to the country, the promise of easy EU money and free migration in the future generally proves too much to resist for small, less wealthy nations on the fringes of Europe.\n\n.@JamesJimCarver is right. EU must stop global meddling. Ukraine to MidEast, EU is destructive, not constructive: http://t.co/5jlWXJxzMz \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 6, 2015\n\nThe European Union has pursued a policy of aggressive expansionism in the 21st century, often with mixed results. Its determined efforts to bring Ukraine into its sphere of influence was one of the direct causes leading to the deadly Ukraine conflict, their involvement being so destructive that Brexit leader Nigel Farage in 2014 said the Union had \u201cblood on its hands in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWorking in tandem with the rapid expansion into Eastern Europe has been the European Union\u2019s ultra-liberal approach to open borders and free movement of people.\n\nWhile this generally benefitted the bloc\u2019s original, relatively wealthy member-states, the sudden extension of freedom of movement to millions of new EU citizens from poorer new member-states in the south and east of Europe has been a genuine and significant source of social friction, and undercut wages for workers in countries like the United Kingdom.\n\nIndeed, the sudden surge in immigration from new EU member-states to the United Kingdom when the bloc expanded to the east in the early 2000s was a significant contributing factor to the souring of relations between the British people and \u201cthe European Project\u201d.\n\nThis distrust was not addressed by the political establishment, however, and eventually resulted, in concert with other concerns, in the Brexit vote of 2016 \u2014 predicted by President Trump and perhaps the greatest blow yet to the EU\u2019s authority and integrity.\n\nEU Stands with Iran as Sweeping New Trump Sanctions Hit Oil, Banks https://t.co/sUQx3NcoXs \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 2, 2018", "description": "The U.S. State Dept backed EU expansion into the Balkans despite President Trump's public support for Brexit and independent sovereign states", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Trump-Stars-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
