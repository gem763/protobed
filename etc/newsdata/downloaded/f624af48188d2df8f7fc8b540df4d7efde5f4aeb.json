Eagles flank the U.S. Capitol above a pair of crossed bats set with a diamond. Framed in red and gold enamel are the words \u201cWashington. World 1924 Champions.\u201d On the back it reads: \u201cPresented to J.T. Zachary by the Commissioner of Baseball.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey got the pendant, and they got $500, and they got an overcoat,\u201d said Sally, who plays bridge at the boat club every week. \u201cThat was their prize for winning the World Series, instead of getting $10 million and whatever they get now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nZachary\u2019s two winning games in the \u201924 series were the second and the sixth. (\u201cWalter Johnson only won one,\u201d Sally pointed out.) He won a World Series game as a Yankee, too, in 1928. In 1929, he went 12-0, a record.\n\nHer father loved the game. Zachary was from North Carolina and went straight from college ball to the majors \u2014 never played a day in the minors, Sally said with pride.\n\n\u201cDaddy played 18 years,\u201d Sally said. \u201cHe played for the Washington Senators. He played for the New York Yankees. He played for the Boston Braves and the St. Louis Browns. He said if he was ever traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, he would retire. And that\u2019s when he did retire.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nZachary had retired from baseball by the time Sally was born, but he followed the game all his life. Sally remembers her father listening to games on the radio. He kept a radio on the porch of their house in Graham, N.C., and another in the yard so he could listen to the play by play as he puttered.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had one friend who came down with her glove,\u201d Sally remembered. \u201cShe said, \u2018Tom, I\u2019m here for you to teach me to pitch.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhat did he do?\n\n\u201cHe took her out and taught her how to pitch.\u201d\n\nYou can take the man out of baseball but you can\u2019t take baseball out of the man.\n\nIn 1927, Zachary was in his second stint as a Washington Senator when he gave up Babe Ruth\u2019s record-setting 60th home run, a blast down the right field line. Or did he?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a foul,\u201d Sally said. \u201cSince it was Babe Ruth\u2019s 60th, the umpire fudged a little bit and said it was a home run.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the family story, anyway.\n\n\u201cHe and Babe Ruth actually were friends,\u201d Sally said. \u201cThe year after the home run, Daddy was playing for the Yankees.\u201d\n\nYears later, the two were together at an old-timer\u2019s game. The Bambino went up to Zachary and growled good-naturedly: \u201cYou son of a bitch. You\u2019re still saying it was a foul.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSally and her husband, John \u201cJigger\u201d Harper, live in Alexandria. She came to Northern Virginia in 1960, after college. She taught health and PE at George Washington High (\u201cI\u2019m athletic,\u201d she said), then began a career in real estate. She\u2019s been an agent with McEnearney Associates for 40 years.\n\nAD\n\nWhat would Tom Zachary \u2014 veteran of the only Washington ballclub to win a World Series title \u2014 think as this year\u2019s players contend for the honor?\n\n\u201cI think that he would be very excited that the Nationals are hopefully going to win.\u201d\n\nShe added that she\u2019d love to throw out the first ball.\n\nWhole lava love\n\nWhat will the atmosphere be like at Friday\u2019s home opener at Nationals Park? Perhaps it will resemble the opening game of the 1924 World Series at Griffith Stadium, memorably described in The Washington Post by Francis P. Daily:\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe lid blew off the top of all seething humanity yesterday afternoon in the bursting of the bottled, pent-up, hogtied emotion of a great city\u2019s populace that was comparable only to the eruption of a passionate volcano.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA giant carboy of sparkling burgundy, personifying the spirit of youth and effervescing in all its joyousness, illustrates the mob psychology of the spectacle that was enacted by 40,000 human calliopes who were packed, jammed, sandwiched into Griffith Stadium to watch two great physically perfect fighting machines battle for the baseball championship of the universe.\u201d\n\nMan, they really knew how to write back then.
