There would be no customs duties on goods crossing to Northern Ireland if they were to stay there.\"\n\nBut, as the clock struck midnight in Brussels, the talks were still going on between Britain's Brexit negotiator David Frost and the EU's executive European Commission.\n\nThat could force another extension of the date for the UK's split from the 27 other member states, the third since Britons voted in a June 2016 referendum to quit the EU.\n\nBritain's plan to leave the EU, which has only ever added new member states, has compounded problems for a bloc torn by euroscepticism and economic disparities.\n\nBritain has itself been polarized bitterly by Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSE, BUT NOT THERE YET\n\nA second EU official said an agreement was \"close but not 100% certain\", adding \"there are still parts that need to be nailed down\".\n\nSterling surged to its highest level against the dollar and the euro since May on Tuesday on rising hopes for a deal.The main sticking point in talks has been the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe question is how to prevent the border becoming a backdoor into the EU's single market without erecting controls which could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that talks had moved in the right direction.\n\n\"But whether we will be able to conclude a revised withdrawal agreement, which after all is an international treaty, in time for the summit on Thursday, that's as of now unclear,\" he said, adding that some hours earlier the gap had been \"quite wide, particularly on the issue of customs.\"\n\nThe small Northern Irish party supporting Britain's minority government said further work was required to get a deal through.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to need the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) support if he is to get it through a vote in the British parliament.\n\n\"We respect (the) fact negotiations are ongoing therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required,\" the DUP said in a statement.\n\nIf London is unable to clinch a deal, an acrimonious divorce could follow that would hit trade and business, roil financial markets and potentially lead to the United Kingdom splitting.\n\n\n\n\n\nWINNING UK PARLIAMENT'S SUPPORT\n\nEven if Johnson wins the approval of Europe's big powers for the deal his negotiators have proposed, he must still sell it to a British parliament in which he does not command a majority.\n\nBrexit-supporting Conservative lawmaker Owen Paterson said Johnson's emerging divorce deal was \"unacceptable\".\n\nA leading figure in the 2016 referendum who came to power as head of ruling Conservative Party in July, Johnson has pledged to take the country out of the bloc on Oct. 31 whether or not a withdrawal agreement has been reached.\n\nBut parliament has passed a law saying Britain cannot leave without an agreement, and Johnson has not explained how he can get around that.\n\nThe main obstacle has been around customs, with the latest proposal envisaging that Northern Ireland stays in the UK customs area. Tariffs would apply on goods crossing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland if they were deemed to be headed further to EU member Ireland and the bloc's single market.", "description": "LUXEMBOURG/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Last-ditch talks between Britain and the European Union to get a Brexit deal ahead of a summit of the bloc's leaders this week went on past midnight to Wednesday, but it was still unclear if London could avoid postponing its departure due on Oct. 31.
