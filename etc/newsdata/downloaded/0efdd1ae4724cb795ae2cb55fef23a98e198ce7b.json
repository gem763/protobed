They're also adept at coming in from the flanks, so I think they're real all-rounders.\n\n'Joao Felix is getting more playing time than Ivan Saponjic, but the same goes for him as the other lads \u2013 he's always working hard in training, he's a very strong guy when it comes to holding off defenders and creating space, and he has great movement in the box.'\n\nAtletico Madrid have suffered a difficult start to the season and have only won four of their eight La Liga games so far, sitting three points off Real and the top.\n\nSaul believes right back Kieran Trippier, signed from Spurs for \u00a319.8m, is a 'real all-rounder'\n\nJoao Felix (pictured right with Saul) was the biggest arrival in terms of price, at a huge \u00a3113m\n\nThey have been tipped to push their Madrid rivals and Barcelona for the title, but Saul is insistent that the club have not set specific targets for the campaign.\n\n'We haven't set any. We take things game-by-game,' he noted. 'It sounds silly, but whenever we stray from this philosophy and say that we're aiming to win the Champions League, LaLiga, or the Copa del Rey then we end up screwing everything up in every competition and ending the season empty-handed, so we're going to take every game as it comes.\n\n'In the last two seasons we've finished second and we're getting closer and closer to winning it. FC Barcelona are playing at a very high level and in the last two seasons there was even one occasion where they won the league having only lost once, and even then it was in the penultimate game of the season.\n\n'When you're fighting for the title against opponents such as these it makes things harder, but we're competing and we're getting closer. If we keep taking things every game as they come then in the final five matches of the season I'll be able to tell you what our objectives are.'\n\nWatch every LaLiga match live in the UK and Ireland on Premier Sports", "description": "Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez has heaped praise on Atletico Madrid's summer signings and insists that they will help the club get to the top with both their on-field talents and off-field personalities.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19596978-0-image-a-167_1570809342781.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
