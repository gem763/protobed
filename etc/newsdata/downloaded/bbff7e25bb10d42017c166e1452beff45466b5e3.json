The plane can no longer fly, but it can fire up its four engines and taxi around the airfield.\n\nAviation enthusiasts were transported back in time as they donned fighter pilot uniforms on Sunday during a fascinating historical reenactment\n\n'Just Jane' was built at Longbridge near Birmingham, in April 1945, by Austin Motors.\n\nGiven the serial number NX611, she was due to join the RAF's Tiger Force in the Far East - but after Japan's early surrender, the plane was put in storage.\n\nIn 1952, the French Government bought the plane, painted her midnight blue and she went on maritime patrol for the French Naval Air Arm.\n\nMoved to New Caledonia ten years later, she had another makeover - this time, painted white - and was used for air sea rescue and cartography.\n\nHeld on an original WWII airfield, crew appeared ready take to the skies as they flanked the famous bomber which helped destroy the Nazi war machine\n\nJust Jane finally came home in 1965, landing at Biggin Hill in May, after yet another overhaul in Sydney a year earlier. Public appearances were few, and brief, due to the costs involved - and in 1972, she was put up for auction in Blackpool. After failing to reach the reserve price, she was eventually bought by the Rt Hon Lord Lilford - who sold her on to brothers Fred and Harold Panton in 1983. JUST JANE: THE FAMOUS LANCASTER BOMBER Engines: Four Rolls-Royce Merlin 24 engines (1640Hp each)\n\nSpan: 102ft\n\nLength: 69ft, 11 3/4in\n\nHeight: 20ft 6in\n\nWing area: 1,300sqft\n\nWeight, empty: 37,330lb\n\nMax weight, all up: 72,000lb\n\nMax bomb load: 18,000lb\n\nMax speed: 275mph at 15,000ft\n\nRange: 2,350 miles with 7,000lb bomb load . They kept Just Jane in an old airfield they had acquired in East Kirkby. The Pantons, from Lincolnshire, had lost their pilot brother Christopher on a Nuremburg Raid in March 1944. In 1993, restoration work began on the plane's engines, thanks to the efforts of two ex-RAF engineers. Work was later carried on the propeller blades - and local contractors checked all the wiring. Further tweaks were made on the motor, magnetos, fuel booster pump, ignition harness, throttle controls and fuel jettison system. Finally, after several hundred man hours, the engine was ready, at a cost of \u00a37,000. Repairs were then done on the three other engines - and all now comply with the taxiing standard.\n\nThe men of Bomber Command suffered 10 per cent of all the casualties in the war.\n\nFew of the thousands of bombers, who came from all over the world including the Commonwealth, are still alive.\n\nNight after night, the bombers climbed into their cramped and freezing aircraft to strike at Germany\u2019s cities and factories \u2013 the odds on them surviving enemy jets and anti-aircraft guns growing longer with each raid.\n\nIn 1940, Winston Churchill praised them as Britain's 'salvation'.\n\nThe way they were... brave airmen of the Lancaster bombers\n\nBut amid public disquiet at the allied strategy, the leader snubbed Bomber Command in his 1945 victory broadcast, thanking all other sections of the RAF but them.\n\nAfter the war, there was widespread unease over the controversial tactic of carpet-bombing German cities which caused up to 600,000 civilian casualties.\n\nThe decision to build the memorial was a massive victory for campaigners who blamed Britain's failure to honour members of Bomber Command who lost their lives fighting tyranny on 'political correctness'.\n\nWestminster City Council gave the green light after David Cameron stepped in saying it was 'time for the nation to show its gratitude' to the air crews.\n\nThe memorial recognises the extraordinary sacrifice, courage and dedication of the young men after the Nazis were crushed.", "description": "Aviation enthusiasts were transported back in time on Sunday during a fascinating historical reenactment at the former Lancaster bomber base at RAF East Kirkby.", "authors": ["Sophie Law For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/01/19376912-0-image-a-17_1570409116888.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
