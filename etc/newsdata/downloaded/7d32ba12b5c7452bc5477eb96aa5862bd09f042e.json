It gave no details but said the two sides want to create \u201cfavorable conditions.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s main stock market index was up 1.6% at midday following the announcement. Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 gained 2.3% and South Korea\u2019s main index rose 1%.\n\nBeijing is balking at U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics and other industries.\n\nThe U.S., Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those plans violate China\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nThe U.S. and China have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s imports, disrupting trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment and battering traders on both sides.\n\nIn their latest escalation, Washington imposed 15% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports on Sunday, extending penalties to almost everything the United States buys from China. Beijing responded by imposing duties of 10% and 5% on a range of American imports.\n\nU.S. tariffs of 25% imposed previously on $250 billion of Chinese goods are due to rise to 30% on Oct. 1.\n\nChina has imposed or announced penalties on a total of about $120 billion of U.S. imports, economists estimate. Some have been hit with increases more than once, while about $50 billion of U.S. goods is unaffected, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries.\n\nBeijing also has retaliated by canceling purchases of soybeans, the biggest single U.S. export to China.\n\nBeijing has agreed to narrow its politically sensitive trade surplus with the U.S. but is reluctant to give up development strategies it sees as a path to prosperity and global influence.\n\nTalks broke down in May over how to enforce any agreement.\n\nChina insists Trump\u2019s punitive tariffs must be lifted once a deal takes effect. Washington says at least some must stay to make sure Beijing carries out any promises.\n\nThe last round of talks in July in Shanghai ended with no indication of progress. Neither government has given any indication it is ready to break the deadlock by offering concessions.\n\nSome analysts suggest Beijing is holding out in hopes Trump will feel pressure to make a more favorable deal as his campaign for the 2020 presidential election picks up. Trump has warned that if he is re-elected, China will face a tougher U.S. negotiating stance.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "U.S. and Chinese envoys will meet in early October for more talks aimed at ending a tariff war that threatens global economic growth.", "authors": ["Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/china-us-trade-talks-october.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=542&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
