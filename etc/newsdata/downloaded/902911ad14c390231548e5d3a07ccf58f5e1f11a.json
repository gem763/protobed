He began the 2017 season as a slot cornerback but moved to safety when injuries left the Lions with few options at the position. It was a change that worked out well for Diggs and Detroit, and he became a full-time starter. Last year he agreed to a three-year, $18.6 million extension. He had started five games this season, with 20 tackles (17 solo).\n\nThe Detroit Lions traded Quandre Diggs to Seattle on Tuesday. (AP/Rick Osentoski)\n\nIn 2018, Diggs started all 16 games for the Lions, with 78 tackles (64 solo) and three interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He was also a Pro Bowl alternate.\n\nWith Diggs traded, none of the seven players Detroit drafted in 2015 are still with the team. That was the last year of Martin Mayhew as general manager; Bob Quinn has been GM since.\n\nDetroit has depth at safety, but that doesn\u2019t mean the move makes a lot of sense to anyone who wasn\u2019t involved in the decision to trade him.\n\nLions players not happy\n\nPlayers voted for captains this year and Diggs was among those chosen. He said last month, \u201cI step in this locker room every day, I just want to earn the respect of my teammates, and just let them know I\u2019m going to be out here, I\u2019m going to be ready to go practice every day, I\u2019m going to try to play every snap for those guys. And that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\nIt seemingly wasn\u2019t just words. Based on social media reaction, Diggs\u2019 Lions teammates were not happy with the trade:\n\nStory continues\n\nCornerback Darius Slay:\n\nThis some bull shit here\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Darius Slay (@_bigplayslay23) October 22, 2019\n\nCornerback Jamal Agnew:\n\n\n\n\n\nNooooooooooooooooo \u2014 Mal (@jamalagnew) October 22, 2019\n\nDefensive lineman Damon Harrison:\n\nWowwwwwwwww no way \u2014 Damon Harrison Sr. (@snacks) October 22, 2019\n\nRetired offensive lineman T.J.
