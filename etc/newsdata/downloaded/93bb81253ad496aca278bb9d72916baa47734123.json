One month into this season, the rest of the nation must be wondering how that could be.\n\nHubbard turned in his third 200-yard game over the weekend, running for 296 yards against Kansas State in the top rushing performance of the season.\n\nThe sophomore from Canada has 938 rushing yards, the third-best five-game total to open a season since 2010. Only Bryce Love of Stanford (1,088) and Leonard Fournette of LSU (1,022) had more over that span.\n\nHubbard broke runs of 53, 84 and 44 yards while becoming the first player to rush for at least 200 yards in the first five games of a season for the school that produced Barry Sanders and Thurman Thomas.\n\n\u201cI say this to everybody, but anybody could have done what I did today,\u201d Hubbard said after the 26-13 win. \u201cThere were big holes everywhere. I\u2019m thankful to be in this position, but I just have to go up from here.\u201d\n\nHubbard is averaging 187.6 yards per game to lead the nation. That\u2019s well ahead of second-place Jonathan Taylor of Wisconsin, who is running for 139.8 per game.\n\nHubbard burst onto the scene late last season, taking over as starting running back because of Justin Hill\u2019s season-ending injury against Oklahoma on Nov. 10. He averaged 106.3 yards in four games.\n\nThis season he owns three of the nation\u2019s eight 200-yard games.\n\nBAMA BACKGROUND\n\nAll three quarterbacks who passed for 400 yards Saturday were on Alabama\u2019s roster last year, Al.com first reported.\n\nLayne Hatcher threw for 440 yards and four touchdowns against Troy in his first start for Arkansas State. He was granted immediate eligibility this season because he was a walk-on at Alabama.\n\nThe Crimson Tide\u2019s Tua Tagovailoa passed for 418 yards and six TDs against Mississippi. Oklahoma\u2019s Jalen Hurts threw for 415 yards and three TDs against Texas Tech.\n\nTHE LONG RUN\n\nSavon Scarver of Utah State became the latest player to return a kickoff 100 yards, going the distance against Colorado State . There have been six 100-yard returns through five weeks of the season; there were seven for the entire 2018 season.\n\nRUN, RUN, RUN\n\nAir Force tied Army for most rushing attempts in a game. The Falcons ran 69 times for 382 yards in a win over San Jose State a week after Army carried the same number of times for 403 against Morgan State.\n\nThe 69 runs wasn\u2019t all that impressive by Air Force standards. Last year, the Falcons ran a season-high 87 times against Utah State.\n\nTHIRD DOWN SUCCESS\n\nWake Forest\u2019s 17 third-down conversions on 24 attempts against Boston College were the most since Texas Tech converted 20 of 25 against Oklahoma in 2016.\n\nSACK SOIREE\n\nSMU\u2019s 10 sacks against South Florida obliterated the school record of five. Ten players contributed to the double-digit takedowns of two USF quarterbacks. The 10 sacks matched the season high set by Florida against Miami last month.\n\nSMU\u2019s 25 sacks lead the nation. USF\u2019s five sacks allowed per game ranks last in the nation.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A year ago, hardly anyone outside the Big 12 had heard of Oklahoma State's Chuba Hubbard.
