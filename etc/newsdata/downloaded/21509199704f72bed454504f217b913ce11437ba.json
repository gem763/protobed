(Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\n\nSince before the campaign officially began, Trudeau has attempted to capitalize on Ford's current unpopularity in Ontario, sometimes subtly, more often blatantly.\n\nThe party's first campaign TV ad was on the subtle side. \"Conservatives like to say they're 'For the People,' but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else,\" said Trudeau in the ad, alluding to Ford's successful campaign slogan from last year's provincial election.\n\nOn the blatant end of the spectrum: Trudeau mentioned Ford 14 times in just one news conference in Hamilton.\n\nKouvalis credits Scheer for \"not taking the bait\" from Trudeau.\n\nThis points to the Conservative Party's own strategy about Ford: avoidance at virtually all costs. Ford has not campaigned for Scheer, let alone with him. Scheer has uttered Ford's name in public just three times all campaign, which would be 11 fewer times than Trudeau did in that one news conference. According to Ford's press secretary, the two most prominent conservative politicians in Canada have not met face-to-face in nearly a year.\n\nIt wasn't always this way. In August of last year, Ford was greeted as a conquering hero at the federal Conservative party convention in Halifax, where he gave a keynote speech to thunderous applause. Scheer returned the favour at the Ontario PC party convention in Toronto last November.\n\nIn Kenora, Ont., on Wednesday, Ford said he told Scheer 'from the get-go' that he wouldn't get involved in the federal election campaign. (Angela Johnston/CBC)\n\nBut then came the Ford government's controversies: the appointment of a Ford friend as Ontario Provincial Police commissioner, changes to services for children with autism, and a budget filled with cuts, including a significant rise in class sizes in Ontario high schools.\n\nScheer's avoidance of Ford during the campaign is evidence confirming that the Liberals' strategy was smart, said David Herle, a political consultant who has run Liberal Party campaigns at the federal and provincial level.\n\nThe Conservatives \"obviously knew\" that having Scheer tightly linked to Ford would hurt their party, so they went to great lengths to avoid it, said Herle, owner of the Gandalf Group communications consulting firm, in an interview Thursday.\n\nThat strategy in large part involved Ford nearly disappearing from public view as the election approached. In early June, Ford adjourned the provincial legislature until Oct. 28, taking him out of the question period spotlight until a week after election day.\n\nDuring the campaign, Ford held just two news conferences: one on Sept. 17 in Verner, 400 kilometres north of Toronto, the other on Wednesday in Kenora, 1,500 kilometres northwest of Verner. In the nearly four months since he shuffled his cabinet, Ford has held just one news conference in the provincial capital.\n\nIn his news conferences, Ford has said he's \"too busy governing\" to be involved in the campaign, although many of his cabinet ministers and MPPs have publicized their own campaigning efforts on behalf of federal Conservative candidates.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICYMI?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ICYMI</a> I was pleased to join my colleagues Min <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RodPhillips01?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RodPhillips01</a>, Min <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PrabSarkaria?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PrabSarkaria</a>, and MPPs Sheref Sebaway and Amarjot Sandhu in support of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electbrar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@electbrar</a> for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BramptonSouth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BramptonSouth</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/elxn43?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#elxn43</a> <br><br>Great turnout and strong support from the community! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/onpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#onpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/elxn2019?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#elxn2019</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/m2ccm4gGvb\">pic.twitter.com/m2ccm4gGvb</a> \u2014@PBethlenfalvy Great response in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/YorkCentre?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#YorkCentre</a> this evening for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CPC</a> candidate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelbwillson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@rachelbwillson</a>.
