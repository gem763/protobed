Congressional investigators have also requested two current National Security Council staffers, Michael Ellis and lawyer John Eisenberg, to testify November 4.\n\nThe development comes after Christopher Anderson, a State Department Foreign Service officer, told lawmakers Wednesday that Bolton told him that President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, \u201cwas a key voice with the president on Ukraine.\u201d Bolton was also so concerned with Giuliani\u2019s activities in Ukraine that he called the president\u2019s lawyer a \u201chand grenade who is going to blow everybody up,\u201d according to a former White House aide Fiona Hill.\n\nBolton was present during a July 25 telephone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which prompted the impeachment probe following a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint. During the call, the president suggested Zelensky look into allegations of corruption against former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Both world leaders have denied any pressure was applied to look into the Bidens, and the White House released a transcript of their call as its evidence that no wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cWe had a very good conversation with the Ukrainian president. I had another conversation with him also, I think before that, which was the same thing,\u201d President Trump said of the call Monday. \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d\n\nThe development comes after Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to Bolton, did not appear in Congress Monday to testify as part of the impeachment proceedings, defying a subpoena.\n\nKupperman had filed a lawsuit asking a judge to resolve the conflicting orders from the congressional subpoena compelling him to testify and the White House ordering not to cooperate. He could receive a contempt citation for failing to appear.\n\nKupperman\u2019s attorney Charles Cooper said his client wants the courts to resolve the matter before he appears.\n\n\u201cIt is not Dr. Kupperman who contests your clients\u2019 constitutional claim,\u201d Cooper wrote in a letter to House intelligence committee senior investigative counsel Daniel Noble. \u201cIt is President Trump and every president before him for at least the last half century, who have asserted testimonial immunity for their closest confidential advisers.\n\n\u201cIf [the committee\u2019s] position on the merits of this issue are correct, it will prevail in court, and Dr. Kupperman, I assure you again, will comply with the court\u2019s judgment,\u201d he added.\n\nHouse investigators on the intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight committees have already deposed multiple witnesses in the inquiry, including U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor.\n\nThe UPI contributed to this report.", "description": "House lawmakers invited John Bolton to testify next week as part of the impeachment investigation into President Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1169209737-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
