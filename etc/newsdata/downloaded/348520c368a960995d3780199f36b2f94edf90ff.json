Bush: 'We can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness'", "language": "en", "text": "Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s show of support for former President George W. Bush may have inspired Fox News\u2019s Neil Cavuto to reach across the proverbial aisle and praise his cable news rivals, but it\u2019s falling flat with Mark Ruffalo.\n\nDuring her show on Tuesday, DeGeneres addressed flak she\u2019d received after cheering on the Dallas Cowboys alongside the Texan and former first lady Laura Bush. Though critics pointed to Bush\u2019s political track record, the talk show host made a statement about looking past their differences for the sake of kindness and civility.\n\nMark Ruffalo doesn't agree with Ellen DeGeneres's view on George W. Bush. (Photo: REUTERS/Adrees Latif) More\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different, and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re all different.\n\n\u201cBut just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t only mean the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter [who].\u201d\n\nHer message earned praise from numerous celebrities from both sides of the political spectrum, including Jamie Foxx, Reese Witherspoon, Lara Trump, Blake Shelton and Dean Cain. But Ruffalo, who has frequently expressed liberal views, refuses to cut Bush any slack.\n\nThe Marvel actor took to Twitter to weigh in on DeGeneres\u2019s push for finding common ground. Bush, he tweeted, needs to be \u201cbrought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War\u201d before people can \u201ceven begin to talk about kindness.\u201d\n\nSorry, until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness. https://t.co/dpMwfck6su \u2014 Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re never getting invited back on Ellen again,\u201d one commenter joked, though many of the reactions from fans were positive. One hailed him as a \u201cvoice of reason,\u201d while many argued that celebrities were siding with DeGeneres because she is powerful in Hollywood.\n\nThank you Mark for being better than most of your colleagues in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nMore people need to understand that George Bush was a detriment to mankind, even if not as outlandish as Trump. \u2014 Frederick Joseph (@FredTJoseph) October 9, 2019\n\nCan you believe Mark Ruffalo and Don Cheadle are the only marvel men with any political sense https://t.co/RLK6MFwOTu \u2014 satan \ud83c\udf83 (@MARVELOLOGY) October 9, 2019\n\nit\u2019s official the only brain cell in hollywood is in mark ruffalo\u2019s possession https://t.co/DTtniO9SsR \u2014 fernanda (@pinoemorgan) October 9, 2019\n\nHulk out, Mark Ruffalo. Hulk out. I'm just glad someone with power and influence is reminding the younger generation about the disastrous legacy of the Bush years. https://t.co/eld3qmfP7c \u2014 Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) October 9, 2019\n\nNot everyone agreed. One critic called him \u201cdelusional.\u201d\n\nreally read this. This is the epitome of brain dead Hollywood.

What a monstrous leader.
