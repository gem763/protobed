The couple were held for five years and had three children before they were freed by Pakistani forces.\n\nSoon after their release, the family moved to Ottawa, where Coleman alleges Boyle sexually and physically assaulted her. He faces 19 charges \u2013 including assault, criminal harassment and unlawful confinement.\n\nBoyle has previously testified that the couple had a turbulent relationship, that they participated in BDSM and that Coleman\u2019s \u201ctempestuous personality\u201d affected her ability to accurately recall events.\n\nLawyers for former Taliban hostage say he\u2019s \u2018not easy to like\u2019 but didn\u2019t abuse wife Read more\n\nBut the crown disputed this in their closing arguments.\n\n\u201cThe evidence of Caitlan Coleman is confirmed and supported by other witnesses who testified and irrefutable exhibits,\u201d said prosecutor Meaghan Cunningham, adding these factors enhanced the \u201creliability and credibility\u201d of her statements.\n\n\u201cMr Boyle\u2019s evidence can\u2019t be accepted in the face of this.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also took issue with Boyle\u2019s account of 30 December 2017, the night Coleman ran from the family\u2019s apartment.\n\nAfter her departure, Boyle called police, claiming he feared Colman was suicidal. But Neubauer said Boyle\u2019s expression of concern for his wife was a \u201cfiction\u201d, arguing that the call was a way for him to mislead police and create his own narrative of the situation.\n\n\u201cHe was in damage control mode,\u201d said Neubauer. \u201cThings were slipping out of his control.\u201d\n\nBoyle\u2019s legal team has cast him as an unconventional and arrogant \u2013 but maintain he was truthful in his testimony, even when it reflected poorly on him.\n\nJustice Peter Doody, who is overseeing the case, will permit counsel from both sides to ask further questions arising from the closing arguments, before he renders a verdict.", "description": "Prosecutors say Joshua Boyle, Canadian man on trial for assaulting his wife, advanced a narrative that\u2019s \u2018incompatible with reality\u2019", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab08a5760e7210afceaf9c61869a55a444b1b2b/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a929ccf72bea91d03b4981c4419899f2"}
