Jose Inez Garcia Zarate had already been acquitted of murder charges in 2017 related to the case after the court ruled his actions as an accident.\n\nBREAKING: A California court of appeal overturned the gun conviction against the undocumented immigrant acquitted by a San Francisco jury of murder in the shooting death of Kate Steinle on the city\u2019s Pier 14 in 2015.https://t.co/M8TyGNCW8C \u2014 San Francisco Chronicle (@sfchronicle) August 30, 2019\n\nZarate has been previously deported five times and was in the country illegally at the time of the incident. On Friday, the \u201c1st District Court of Appeals...overturned a gun conviction against Jose Inez Garcia-Zarate because the judge failed to instruct the jury on one of his defenses.\u201d\n\nDuring the murder trail, the illegal immigrant claimed that he did not mean to kill Steinle, but \u201che unwittingly picked up the gun wrapped in a T-shirt and it fired accidentally.\u201d\n\nThe death occurred on a pier on San Francisco\u2019s waterfront. San Francisco considers itself a sanctuary city, meaning it refuses to comply with federal immigration law. It is likely that had it complied with federal law, and had America secured its borders, Steinle would still be alive since Zarate would not have been present in the United States.\n\nInstead, it looks like justice for Steinle will go unanswered.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:20:28AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/185/1609ca1d-7eb7-4a87-a82c-be5fb1679ea1.jpeg"}
