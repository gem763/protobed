That has been the driving force behind everything.\u201d\n\nSteve said that with the help of her occupational therapist, Camre has \u201cgot her personality back\u201d.\n\nCamre repeatedly writes things down as a memorisation technique, and frequently experiences from epileptic seizures.\n\nShe told Good Morning America how her husband\u2019s book has helped to teach her about their relationship together.\n\n\u201cEverything in the book is a memory of what we\u2019ve gone through and what I\u2019ve missed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard for me because it shows me everything that we have ben through and that I don\u2019t have inside of me.\u201d\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
