Those towns that lost the most household, garden and leisure stores during the last five years tended to be in the South East.'\n\nBut it added: 'Despite concerns regarding 'the death of the high street', businesses offering services or experiences that cannot be replicated online have prospered.\n\n'These traders also function as effective drivers of footfall to other businesses.'", "description": "Stores selling books, china and glassware, garden equipment, electrical appliances and antiques are being replaced by tattoo and piercing parlours, hairdressers, nail bars and gambling outlets.", "authors": ["Sean Poulter Consumer Affairs Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/01/19908416-0-image-a-54_1571444482212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
