How about a wedding bouquet of your favorite food?\n\nThat's what one Ohio bride was surprised with when she was presented a bouquet of \u2026 wait for it \u2026 chicken nuggets.\n\nA post from Tyson Brand has gotten some attention after it showed photos of a wedding between Blair Hardy and Adam Tyson earlier this month in Toledo, Ohio.\n\nThe nuggets were provided by Tyson, particularly to celebrate Blair becoming a \"Tyson.\"\n\nIn its Facebook post, Tyson said:\n\n\"This weekend, one of our nugget-loving fans, Blair, married the love of her life\u2014whose last name is none other than Tyson. We thought it was the perfect chance to surprise them with a year\u2019s worth supply of Tyson Fun Nuggets, along with a custom nugget bouquet and nugget toast for the entire wedding. We\u2019re thrilled to have helped celebrate this dino-mite couple! Wishing them a lifetime of #FunNugget love from our Tyson family to theirs. #TysonsFavoriteNugget\"\n\nIt appears a member of Blair's wedding party, Jenna Spetz, may have been behind the surprise. Spetz posted some of the photos of the wedding on Facebook and said, \"A HUGE thank you to @tysonbrand for helping me pull off this EPIC nugget toast! I think the brides more excited for nugs than her new hubby!\"\n\nThe USA TODAY Network has reached out to the bride and Spetz.\n\nThe bride also appears to have received a letter from Noel White, president and CEO of Tyson Foods Inc., according to Spetz's post.\n\nHe offered a few bite-size pieces of advice:\n\n\"Always begin and end each day with kisses and nugs. Remind each other how dino-mite you are together. Double-dipping will only bring you closer. Never go to bed angry (unless he ate the last nugget.)\"\n\nWe love it. And now we just want to see more creative bouquets.\n\nOr maybe we'll just take the chicken nuggets.\n\nBriana Rice is a trending news reporter for the Enquirer.
