He also said he was considering taking legal action.\n\nFollowing the threat to sue, Young deleted the tweet shortly before midnight on Sunday, and issued an apology while maintaining that \u201cspeculators\u201d is sometimes used as a euphemism for Jewish financiers.\n\nToby Young (@toadmeister) Apologies Philip. The suggestion that \u201cspeculators\u201d are controlling the govt could be construed as an anti-Semitic trope if \u201cspeculators\u201d is being used as a euphemism for Jewish financiers, as it sometimes is. But you evidently didn\u2019t mean that and I\u2019ve deleted the tweet.\n\nHedge fund managers who have backed Johnson include Crispin Odey, a fund manager who has also previously endorsed Vote Leave and Ukip. Over the summer it was reported that his fund had made a \u00a3300m bet against British businesses and stood to profit from an economic slump in the UK. However, the fund also backed other British companies. Odey has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe Financial Times quoted a senior No 10 official responding to Hammond by saying \u201ccertain MPs are sounding like conspiracy theorists rather than former cabinet ministers with this kind of absurd and undignified mudslinging\u201d.\n\nYoung is close to the prime minister, having been a columnist at the Spectator when Johnson was its editor. Johnson opened Young\u2019s West London free school in 2011 and defended his ex-colleague when his appointment last year to the executive board of the Office for Students, the newly created higher education regulator, was criticised.\n\nYoung\u2019s selection was called into question over his lack of qualifications for the role, exaggerated CV and long track record of offensive remarks. But Johnson, then foreign secretary, described the journalist as \u201cthe ideal man for the job\u201d and condemned the \u201cridiculous outcry\u201d surrounding his appointment.\n\nYoung eventually stepped down from the role following criticism by then prime minister, Theresa May, and amid further controversy over his espousal of what he called \u201cprogressive eugenics\u201d.", "description": "Former chancellor has threatened Young with legal action over accusation", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc99d32a01a5952f5618634b709ebd78084e87f2/12_0_5505_3304/master/5505.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f824def984bbfee5762a33f63e14d04d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
