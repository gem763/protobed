And you're either going to hate these changes, or not notice them at all.\n\nMust read: The 2019 iPhone 11 will be annoying, boring, and expensive\n\nGoogle has killed off four tab options in the latest Canary preview nightly build aimed at developers. Gone are the following options:\n\nNew tab\n\nClose other tabs\n\nReopen closed window\n\nBookmark all tabs\n\nIn my experience the number of people who use these features is pretty low, with most people surprised that these options exist. That said, the last time Google floated the idea of culling these options, user outrage was high, and the search giant gave in to pressure.\n\nNot all features and changes in Canary builds make it to the final release, so Google may back down again. If you use these options, then my suggestion is that you start learning and using the keyboard shortcuts for the options you need.\n\nSee also:", "description": "The change is either going to annoy you in a big way, or you won't notice.", "authors": ["Adrian Kingsley-Hughes"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/16/6421ef02-ffdf-41e4-af9d-fb182c1adad6/thumbnail/770x578/2d8940b857ae493b260a4978a3bb0dd0/chrome-logo.png"}
