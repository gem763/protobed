On Sunday, following a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump announced he was moving U.S. special forces out of the Kurdish-held territory of Syria, a move that cleared the way for the invasion.\n\nTrump said the United States \"does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans and former administration officials joined Democrats in criticizing the president's decision to pull U.S. troops from the area, saying it was a betrayal of Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American allies and have been crucial in the effort to contain ISIS.\n\n\"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\" said U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., normally an outspoken ally of the president.\n\nGraham added: \"This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\"\n\nWhite House and State Department officials have stressed for days that Trump did not approve of Turkey\u2019s long-planned military strike and that his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the region was not a \u201cgreen light\u201d for that operation. But critics, including some of Trump\u2019s allies, have noted that by removing troops it cleared the way for Turkey to strike without fear of harming U.S. service members.\n\nTrump tweeted Wednesday that the withdrawal involved roughly 50 service members. An administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of U.S. involvement in the region described the number of soldiers involved to be between 50 and 100.\n\nThe president has repeatedly framed the decision as part of his broader goal of reducing U.S. military engagements oversees. But the same administration official rejected the idea that the soldiers involved are being withdrawn and instead said that the service members would be reassigned to other areas in Syria.\n\nTrump has reduced U.S. military engagement in the country. The U.S. currently has about 1,000 troops in Syria, roughly half of the deployment at the end of last year.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, said news of the invasion sickened her.\n\n\"Turkish troops preparing to invade Syria from the north, Russian-backed forces from the south, ISIS fighters attacking Raqqa,\" she said. \"Impossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\"\n\nIn his statement put out by the White House, Trump said: \"There are no American soldiers in the area.\"\n\nHe also said \"Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2013 and we will hold them to this commitment.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump: Turkey invasion of Kurd-held are of Syria a 'bad idea'", "description": "As Turkey began an invasion of northern Syria, Donald Trump is facing a fierce backlash over his decision to pull U.S. troops from Kurdish territory.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "John Fritze", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S22PoYO.5H_Axbnbc7oZtg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/b5242720-fbd5-448a-a15c-934de8a0fba5/caf40ad2-a0b9-5955-87c5-79130619aed5/data_3_0.jpg?s=c46e64d4d37eb8baa16d12605f9b04d7&c=ba57a65bd110a351620a9c8188aa7e6f&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
