But for Parma, they will be hoping they can pull off another miracle against Inter Milan at the San Siro on Saturday.\n\nInter, then under the stewardship of Luciano Spalleti, were stunned when Parma waltzed out of Milan with a 1-0 victory after a stunning solo goal from Federico Dimarco.\n\nThe effort was superb, the home fans were stunned and Inter, despite boasting 74 per cent possession that day, were left humbled in their own house.\n\nParma are in form and are hoping lightning strikes twice when they play Inter at the San Siro\n\nInter are a different proposition 12 months on and will want to exact revenge on Saturday night\n\nInter Milan are a different beast now under Antonio Conte. Title challengers. Geniune contenders.\n\nThey never truly looked close to de-throning Juventus in Spalletti's reign.\n\nBut last season serves as a warning to any Inter Milan fans confident of Parma being turned over with any sort of ease.\n\nFederico Dimarico, buried in the pile-on, scored a sensational winner to beat Inter last year\n\nI Gialloblu have won three of their last four Serie A games and head to the San Siro full of confidence after hitting Genoa for five.\n\nThe difficulty will come in that their main strikers Roberto Inglese and Andreas Cornelius - who hit a hat-trick off the bench against Genoa - will miss the trip with injury.\n\nThat definitely doesn't help boss Roberto D'Aversa but the counter-attack could be the best approach anyway, with Inter inevitably going to dominate the ball.\n\n'I already have in mind the picture of the match against Inter, which will be very difficult,' he said following the win over Genoa.\n\n'In football you have to make the pitch talk, as we did tonight. We have to go to San Siro and try to put the Nerazzurri in trouble.\n\n'The guys are having a great season. Even tonight, despite the absences, they have had a great performance.'\n\nAntonio Conte was not around last season but he will know Parma can cause his side problems\n\nJust one defeat to their name this season, Inter know that only Juventus have got the better of them so far.\n\nBut Parma have previous and that loss to Juventus did come at the San Siro, a venue that can become suffocating when the crowd turns and groans grow louder. With Juventus' trip to Lecce seeming to be a formality - on paper, at least - Inter can ill-afford to suffer a repeat of that Dimarco rocket 13 months ago.\n\nRodwell to the rescue?\n\nWhen asked about the amount of players in the physio room right now, Roma boss Paulo Fonseca admitted he has never seen anything quite like it.\n\nEight players were ruled out of the Europa League meeting with Borussia Monchengladbach on Thursday - a game they drew 1-1 after Chris Smalling conceded a 94th minute penalty - and few seem close to a return.\n\n'It's impossible to achieve a level of growth and progression with all these injuries,' Fonseca told reporters earlier this week.\n\nFormer Manchester City and Everton midfielder Jack Rodwell is preparing to move to Roma\n\n'It's true that in the match against Sampdoria, the team didn't express themselves in the best way and could've done more.\n\n'We miss some important players and, that, consistency. It's no excuse but simply reality.'\n\nAnd so what do you do when your squad has been decimated by injuries? Well, you turn to Jack Rodwell, of course.\n\nThe 28-year-old is a free agent and as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail on Thursday, is travelling to the Italian capital to complete a deal until the end of the season.\n\nWhen Rodwell parted with Blackburn earlier in the year, few would have even entertained the idea that the Englishman, who was hailed as one of the nation's best talents as a teenager, could navigate his way to one of Europe's most esteemed clubs.\n\nRoma's injury crisis is mounting as reserve striker Nikola Kalinic (pictured) holds his knee\n\nBut Fonseca is desperate and needs bodies at his disposal.\n\nStefano Pioli's AC Milan side are the visitors to the Stadio Olympico this weekend and they will no doubt smell blood (not from the injured players, they will be on a physio table somewhere).\n\nMilan were denied a maiden win under their new boss against Lecce last time out but given how weakened Roma are with their current injury status, will know they will not get many better opportunities to beat their Roman rivals.\n\nCagliari too good to ignore\n\nWEEKEND FIXTURES FRIDAY Hellas Verona v Sassuolo SATURDAY Lecce v Juventus (2pm) Inter Milan v Parma (5pm) Genoa v Brescia (7:45pm) SUNDAY Bologna v Sampdoria (11:30am) SPAL v Napoli (2pm) Torino v Cagliari (2pm) Atalanta v Udinese (2pm) Roma v AC Milan (5pm) Fiorentina v Lazio (7:45pm)\n\nCagliari are firm contenders to qualify for next season's Champions League, make no mistake about that.\n\nWho saw that coming?\n\nRolando Maran is striking all the right notes down in Sardinia and fans are daring to dream of their first appearance in the European Cup - the Champions League to us these days - since 1970-71.\n\nGranted, the odds are heavily stacked against them with Juventus, Inter Milan and Napoli all widely expected to take three of the four allocated spots for qualification.\n\nThat leaves the fourth and final place that Cagliari, along with Roma, Atalanta and Lazio, will feel they can claim should they create a consistent formula for success.\n\nRivals would be well inclined to ask what is in the water in Sardinia right now with Maran's squad unbeaten in their last five league games.\n\nThey were given a reality check after back-to-back defeats to start the season but the club have flourished ever since, largely due to Radja Nainggolan playing the role of conductor in the midfield.\n\nCagliari have been one of the most impressive sides in Serie A this season as they sit fifth\n\n'He has extraordinary technique and you feel his influence throughout the match,' Maran said, hailing his midfield anchor, after a recent win over SPAL.\n\nThey are on the road at Torino on Sunday, a side winless in their last three games. While Juventus and Inter Milan hog all the headlines, another win for Maran's men will ensure they get the attention their promising start to the season deserves.\n\nElsewhere... Motta starts Genoa reign\n\nThe most surprising thing at Genoa in recent weeks was that Aurelio Andreazzoli managed to cling on to his job for as long as he did.\n\nDefeat to AC Milan should have spelled the end; it didn't. But the board could not ignore the 5-1 hammering away to Parma last time out and Andreazzoli himself conceded in his post-match interview that his time was up.\n\nIn to replace him is former Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta.\n\nThe Brazilian-born Italian is shy of management experience but frankly, it cannot get much worse at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.\n\nThiago Motta's reign as Genoa manager gets underway at home against Brescia on Saturday\n\nFirst up is a home game against Mario Balotelli's Brescia and Motta will know a winning start, particularly against a side within touching distance, is imperative.\n\nGet turned over in similar fashion to last weekend against Parma and Motta could send the club bottom, with stadium sharers Sampdoria only a point behind, and under new management themselves. His only previous experience as a boss came with the Paris Saint-Germain Under-19 side. Thiago, this is going to be a hell of a lot tougher than that.\n\nElsewhere, Atalanta will look to return to winning ways after their humbling away to Manchester City in the Champions League.\n\nGian Piero Gasperini's side have been rather Jekyll and Hyde domestically and in Europe this season with their Serie A form deserting them when it comes to the biggest stage of all.\n\nThe fixture list has been kind to them with Udinese, who have yet to win away from home this season, the visitors at the newly-renovated Gewiss Stadium.\n\nJuventus were given a brief scare last time out against Bologna but Maurizio Sarri's side will be confident of maintaining their unbeaten start to the campaign away at Lecce.\n\nJuventus are looking to build on their 2-1 midweek win when they travel to take on Lecce\n\nPaulo Dybala's heroics in midweek against Lokomotiv Moscow will have helped, but there is a feelgood factor around the Old Lady right now, with players appearing happier than they were at the end under Massimiliano Allegri.\n\nLazio, who were stunned in the closing stages against Celtic on Thursday, will be seeking an immediate response in the late game on Sunday as they take on a Franck Ribery-led Fiorentina.\n\nLa Viola started miserably but are now just four points off the Champions League places with Vincenzo Montella easing the immediate pressures around his position.\n\nThat one, given Ciro Immobile is the league's top scorer for Lazio, has all the hallmarks of being a cracker.", "description": "Parma, with the help of Dejan Kulusevski (right), will hope lightning strikes twice when they face Inter at the San Siro having won their in 2018.
