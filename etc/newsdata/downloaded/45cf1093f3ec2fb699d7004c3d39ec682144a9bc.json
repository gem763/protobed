It wouldn't surprise me if there a terrorist nuclear attack within the next 15 years.\n\n''The room is incredibly strong and has everything you need inside. If the worst did happen it is exactly where you would want to be.\"\n\nThe man, who worked as an electrical engineer, became concerned at the nuclear threat when he served as a member of the Royal Observer Corps, Plymouth Live reports.\n\n(Image: PlymouthLive/ WS)\n\nHe built the shelter, which took six months to complete and cost \u00a345,000, to keep his family safe at their home in Kingswear Road, Brixham.\n\nThe bunker, which did not require planning permission because it is underground, has two entrances: a shaft from the kitchen or through a fake wardrobe in the study.\n\nBoth entrances are protected by huge steel blast doors and there is also an emergency exit in case the main doors are welded shut by the blast.\n\nThe shelter, which has six bunk beds, has its own ventilation system and power supply with a diesel-powered generator and numerous batteries.\n\n(Image: PlymouthLive/ WS)\n\nIts floors are covered with carpets and plywood sheets line the walls. The temperature inside remains a constant 12C.\n\nThe hideaway is lined with angle girders filled with hundreds of tons of concrete and steel reinforcing bars to create walls up to 32 inches thick.\n\nIt features a 1,400-litre water tank, toilet, a small hand basin, and a phone line.\n\nMr Thomas also stocked the bunker with enough tinned and dried food to feed his partner and son Daniel for a month.\n\n(Image: PlymouthLive/ WS)\n\nOther facilities include a TV and DVD player, a microwave and a range of board games and books to pass the time.\n\nThe man designed the shelter to ensure it would withstand an atomic bomb attack on the nearest potential military target, the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth less than two miles away.\n\nIn 2010 he was selling up so he could downsize to a smaller property, and because he no longer believed a nuclear attack was imminent.\n\nHe said at the time: \"When I built the bunker I was a young man with my whole life ahead of me. I wanted to make absolutely sure my family was safe.\n\n(Image: PlymouthLive/ WS)\n\n''I'm now not as fearful of a nuclear attack as I once was. I hope it can now offer another family the same peace of mind it has given us.\"\n\nHe added the bunker would offer the new owners protection against a solar flare disaster which was being predicted by some scientists for 2013.\n\nMr Thomas put his four-bedroom house and bunker on the market for \u00a3350,000.", "description": "Mike Thomas, of Brixham, Devon,designed the shelter to keep his family safe - even stocking up enough canned food to feed his partner and son for a month", "authors": ["Sarah Waddington", "Chiara Fiorillo", "Image", "Plymouthlive", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652778.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Man-builds-nuclear-bunker-20-feet-below-his-kitchenIt-is-the-strongest-privately-owned-bunker-in-Br.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
