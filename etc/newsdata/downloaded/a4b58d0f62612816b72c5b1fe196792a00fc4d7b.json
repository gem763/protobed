Ends School Lunch-Shaming by Guaranteeing All Students Will Get a Meal", "language": "en", "text": "A 10-year-old boy\u2019s fight to end student lunch debt and save his classmates the shame of being served an \u201calternative\u201d meal at school has inspired real change in California.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation on Saturday to ban the practice of singling out students unable to pay for their lunch, and cited the efforts of elementary schooler Ryan Kyote in helping bring the issue to greater attention.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Ryan for his empathy and his courage in bringing awareness to this important issue,\u201d Newsom said in a news release.\n\nThe new legislation, authored by state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, makes it so schools are no longer allowed to serve cheaper, \u201calternative\u201d lunches to students whose parents are unable to pay.\n\nIt ensures that all students will get a \u201cstate reimbursable meal of their choice,\u201d even if their parent or guardian has unpaid meal fees.\n\nKyote made headlines this summer after he donated $74.80 of his allowance savings to pay off the school lunch debt for his third-grade classmates at West Park Elementary School in Napa, California.\n\nKylie Kirkpatrick (left) and son Ryan Kyote | Courtesy Kylie Kirkpatrick More\n\nHis generosity even led to a meeting with Newsom in August, where the Democrat promised that if he got the bill on his desk, he would sign it, Kyote\u2019s mom Kylie Kirkpatrick tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been telling everybody is one down and 49 to go,\u201d she says of the remaining states she\u2019d like to see take similar action. \u201cMillions and millions of children will be positively affected by [this policy] and Ryan couldn\u2019t be more proud. We still have a lot of work to do and hopefully will get something passed at the federal level.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 9-Year-Old Boy Pays Off School Lunch Debt for Classmates \u2014 and Sparks a National Discussion\n\nKirkpatrick told PEOPLE in June that her son\u2019s activism first took off after he heard about a 5-year-old in Indiana who was denied lunch because they were unable to pay for the meal.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand why that happened. Why would that happen to a 5-year-old?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt really touched him in a way and he wanted to do something so that wouldn\u2019t happen to his friends. We talked about what we could do to make a difference locally.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: School Lunch Lady Loses 100 lbs. Eating Her Own Cafeteria Food\n\nThe average lunch debt incurred by U.S. students was $2,500, School Nutrition Association spokesperson Diane Pratt-Heavner told the New York Times.\n\nIn September, a 9-year-old Ohio boy had his lunch taken away from him on his birthday because of a $9 unpaid debt on his account, and was given cheese and bread instead.\n\nThe Green Local School district later amended its policy so that all students would be able to receive their standard lunch regardless of account balance.\n\nRELATED: Ohio School District Fixes Lunch Policy After 9-Year-Old\u2019s Meal Taken Away on His Birthday\n\nThree-quarters of the 5 billion lunches served in school cafeterias in 2018 were offered at a free or reduced price, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn May, Warwick Public Schools in Rhode Island responded to backlash by reversing a policy that would have limited students who held a lunch debt to eating a cold sun butter and jelly sandwich instead of a variety of hot lunch options. The district said it implemented the policy because it had accumulated a $77,000 lunch debt.\n\nThe School Nutrition Association previously reported that 75 percent of school districts reported having unpaid student meal debt at the end of the 2016-2017 school year.", "description": "Calif.
