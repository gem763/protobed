The album version of the show subsequently debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart when it was released nearly six months later, and in 1996 it won the band\u2019s surviving members the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\n\u201cUnplugged\u201d marked a drastic departure from the grunge band\u2019s comparatively noisier earlier album, and the performance contained only a handful of the band\u2019s better-known songs at the time. Instead it was rife with renditions of tunes originally performed by artists Nirvana admired \u2014 namely David Bowie, The Vaselines, Lead Belly and the Meat Puppets \u2014 and featured members of the latter performing several of their own songs.\n\nThe forthcoming reissue includes the same 14 tracks as the original \u201cUnplugged\u201d record in addition to outtakes that were recorded during rehearsals for the taping and previously made available on a DVD version of the show released 2007. They include Nirvana originals \u201cCome As You Are,\u201d \u201cPolly\u201d and \u201cPennyroyal Tea,\u201d as well as \u201cPlateau\u201d by the Meat Puppet and Bowie\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Sold the World.\u201d\n\nThe original album version of \u201cUnplugged\u201d sold roughly 3 million copies within three months of being released. Nirvana was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nearly 20 years later in 2014.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
