Coresight estimates closures could reach 12,000 by the end of the year, the report said.\n\nCoresight, which has offices in Manhattan, London and Hong Kong, tracked the 5,864 closings in 2018, which included all Toys R Us stores and hundreds of Kmart and Sears locations.\n\nKmart and Sears store closings list: Kmart, Sears closing additional stores by the end of the year.

This included an earlier round of Payless closings, the entire HHGregg electronics and appliance chain, and hundreds of Sears and Kmart stores.\n\nThe pain is expected to continue into future years, according to an April report from UBS Securities. UBS analysts said 75,000 more stores would need to be shuttered by 2026 if e-commerce penetration rises to 25% from its current level of 16%.\n\nA separate analysis by UBS said tariffs on Chinese imports could put $40 billion of sales and 12,000 stores at risk.\n\n\u201cThe market is not realizing how much brick & mortar retail is incrementally struggling and how new 25% tariffs could force widespread store closures,\u201d UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote in the May report. \"We think potential 25% tariffs on Chinese imports could accelerate pressure on these company\u2019s profit margins to the point where major store closures become a real possibility.\u201d\n\nCharming Charlie store closings: Retailer going out of business, will close all 261 stores in Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nIs Toys R Us making a comeback?: A year after stores closed, there's talk of new locations\n\nClosing all locations\n\nThousands of locations have already closed this year with the final Payless stores finishing their liquidation sales in June.
