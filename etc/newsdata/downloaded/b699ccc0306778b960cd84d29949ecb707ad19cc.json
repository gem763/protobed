Tim Ryan for Failed Presidential Bid", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump ridiculed Rep. Tim Ryan on Friday after the Ohio Democrat congressman ended his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump noted Ryan and fellow Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell were both at zero percent when they dropped out of the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\u201cSuch talk and bravado from both, and nothing to show,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThey stood for nothing, and the voters couldn\u2019t stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!\u201d\n\nRyan launched his candidacy for president arguing he could win Democrat blue-collar voters back from supporting President Trump in 2020. He warned that Democrats were moving too far left to win states like Ohio.\n\n\u201cSee Tim, it\u2019s not so easy out there if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t effective for USA workers, just talk!\u201d\n\nAnother big dropout of the Presidential race was, along with 0% Tim Ryan, 0% @RepSwalwell. Such talk and bravado from both, and nothing to show. They stood for nothing, and the voters couldn\u2019t stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end! \u2014 Donald J.
