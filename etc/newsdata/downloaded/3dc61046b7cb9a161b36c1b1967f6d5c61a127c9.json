I was sad, because I thought I looked fat.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n\"I was sad because I counted how many blueberries I put on my porridge every morning (like some sort of crazed, calorie-obsessed Carol Vorderman), I didn't drink, I never ate in restaurants & I trained twice a day.\"\n\nVicky goes on to reveal that she's now in a much better place with her health and body image.\n\nShe continued: \"Now look at the girl on the right - yip, I've gained some weight this year.
