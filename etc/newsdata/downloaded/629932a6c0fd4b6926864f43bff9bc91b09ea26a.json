According to the department, Smollett said two individuals shouted racist and homophobic slurs, physically attacked him and wrapped a rope around his neck before they fled.\n\nThe assault, which Chicago police vowed to investigate as a \"possible hate crime,\" elicited outrage not only from Smollett's friends and colleagues but also from a number of politicians such as Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom tweeted their support for Smollett after the allegations surfaced.\n\nThe unsettling story would not remain so straightforward as the investigation progressed, however.\n\nEarly in February authorities brought in two brothers, at least one of whom Smollett knows, questioning them first as persons of interest, then as \"potential suspects\" \u2014 only to release them without charge shortly afterward. According to police, \"new evidence\" that arose during their interrogations \"had shifted\" the investigation.\n\nAnd they announced that they would need to again speak with Smollett.\n\nAll the while, as rumors and reports began to circulate that Smollett himself had a hand in orchestrating the attack \u2014 rumors that police batted down earlier this month as having \"no evidence\" \u2014 the Empire star maintained his original account in comments to the media.\n\n\"At first, it was a thing of, like, 'Listen, if I tell the truth then that's it, because it's the truth,' \" Smollett said of his reaction to the rumors, in an interview with Good Morning America. \"Then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, how can you doubt that? Like, how do you not believe that? It's the truth.' And then it became a thing of like, 'Oh, it's not necessarily that you don't believe that this is the truth; you don't even want to see the truth.' \"\n\nSmollett's account came against the backdrop of the latest national data compiled on hate crimes in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the FBI's \"Hate Crime Statistics, 2017,\" released in mid-2018, there was a 17 percent increase in hate crimes since 2016.\n\nIn 2017, there were 7,175 bias crimes involving 8,493 victims. Nearly 60 percent of the victims were targeted because of their race or ethnicity; 20.6 percent were targeted owing to their religion; and 15.8 percent were targeted for their sexual orientation.", "description": "The actor had reported being the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.
