Getty Images\n\nThose accused were blamed for \u201cinciting mass disorder\u201d even though video footage showed only violence from riot police. Rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation \u2013 to gather peacefully without arms and to organise meetings and protests \u2013 are now being treated by the government as criminal acts.\n\nWidespread lawlessness, the arrest of political opponents, violence by police officers against peaceful residents, the unlawful detainment of children, threats to parents \u2013 all have become common practice in Russia. There are already over 200 political prisoners in the country. Every basic human right has been violated, the Constitution completely ignored, and elections turned into democratic window dressing.\n\nIn the face of this repression at home, we have seen how president Putin\u2019s regime has sought legitimacy through the free world, where its corrupt representatives keep their money, own property, have families and residence cards, and even hold citizenship.\n\nThese individuals, who break the law and violate the human rights of their own citizens, cynically take advantage of the rights and freedoms of democratic nations. They use our lobbyists, lawyers, former politicians, and intelligence officers for their own ends. They corrupt acting politicians and officials and put pressure on private businesses, pushing many to play by their rules and work in favour of their interests.\n\nThe Russian government is increasingly impinging on the lives of people in the free world. Its representatives manipulate foreign elections, spread disinformation and propaganda, enlist hackers and troll factories, deploy spies, take hostages, and even commit murder. The regime annexes sovereign territory and conducts irresponsible nuclear missile testing, which has already led to casualties and degradation of the environment.\n\nClearly, these actions are dangerous not only for Russian citizens but for the entire world. We call on anyone who cares about democracy and human rights to act immediately to stop the lawlessness of president Putin\u2019s regime. Its actions are unacceptable \u2013 and indulgence or weakness with this regime constitutes a threat to democracy worldwide.\n\nSpecifically, we must adopt an uncompromising stance toward residents of democratic states who help president Putin and his cronies with the laundering of stolen Russian capital. Bankers, lobbyists, politicians, and consultants must acknowledge that any help provided to such officials and their accomplices is an unconscionable crime (and is often paid for by money of criminal origins).\n\nWe also appeal to international companies whose business is important to the realization of the democratic rights and freedoms that we value. Russian authorities are trying to force such companies, from Facebook to Google, to comply with domestic laws that stifle civil society. We consider this pressure to be illegal and call on the international business community not to succumb and to demand political independence when operating in Russia.\n\nIn closing, we thoroughly condemn the political repression and lawlessness taking place today in Russia. With each passing day, the threat of being put behind bars for months, and even years, grows for the few brave political activists that remain in the country. Most have been forced into exile. All of them count on the support of international partners in their continued efforts.\n\nWe express solidarity with every member of the worldwide opposition to president Putin\u2019s regime. Every person in the world deserves to live in a country that respects the values of democracy, freedom, and justice and actively works to secure them for every citizen.\n\nSigned,\n\nMikhail Khodorkovsky, founder of Open Russia, Russia\n\nAnne Applebaum, Washington Post columnist and senior fellow, Johns Hopkins, US\n\nAnders Aslund, economist and Russia expert, US\n\nGuto Bebb, member of parliament for Aberconwy, UK\n\nMarieluise Beck, former state secretary, Center for Liberal Modernity, Germany\n\nDavid Benioff, co-creator of Game of Thrones, US\n\nWolf Biermann, singer and writer, Germany\n\nArend Jan Boekestijn, Utrecht University, former member of Dutch Parliament, Netherlands\n\nMax Boot, senior fellow, Council on Foreign Relations, US\n\nLaurens Jan Brinkhorst, former deputy prime minister and former minister of economic affairs, Netherlands\n\nWilliam Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Movement, UK\n\nTina Brown, founder and CEO of Tina Brown Live Media/Women in the World, US\n\nChris Bryant, member of parliament for Rhondda, UK\n\nJohn Bruton, former prime minister, Ireland\n\nEmmanuel Carr\u00e8re, writer, France\n\nBryan Cartledge, former British ambassador to the USSR and Hungary, UK\n\nViorel Cibotaru, former minister of defense, Moldova\n\nIrwin Cotler, former minister of justice and attorney general, Canada\n\nHerta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin, former minister of justice, Germany\n\nMartin Dewhirst, Russia expert, UK\n\nLarry Diamond, senior fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, US\n\nPr Hon.
