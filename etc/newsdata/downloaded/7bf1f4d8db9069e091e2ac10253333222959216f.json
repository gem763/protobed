in great spirits during Thursday's tour, and she even got some hands-on experience.\n\nShe happily drilled a rivet into sheet metal while visiting one of the technical college's classrooms.\n\nIvanka and Pompeo later took part in a roundtable discussion with Dr. Sheree Utash, the president of WSU Tech and vice president of workforce development at Wichita State University.\n\nDuring the

group of Wichita-based aviation companies signed the Pledge to America's Workers, the Trump administration's initiative designed to get private companies to expand job training.\n\nWhile in Wichita on Thursday, Ivanka took to Instagram to preemptively celebrate her 10-year wedding anniversary with Jared by sharing throwback photos of herself on their big day.\n\n'Looking forward to celebrating 10

Brilliant innovators such as Walter Beech & Clyde Cessna established this city as the hub for aircraft making during the early half of the 20th Century. 100 yrs later, Wichita remains a leader worldwide in aviation manufacturing!'\n\nIvanka stayed home on Monday and Tuesday while celebrating the Jewish holiday Shemini Atzeret with her family.\n\nShemini Atzeret immediately follows the seventh day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot. It is a separate, yet connected, holy day devoted to the spiritual aspects of Sukkot.\n\nIvanka converted to Judaism in 2009 to marry Jared, an Orthodox Jew, and they are raising their three children Orthodox as well.", "description": "Jared, 38, was followed by his eight-year-old daughter when he stepped out of their Washington, D.C. home on Friday morning around 8 a.m.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/18/20191056-0-image-a-2_1572024880214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
