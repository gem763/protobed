So I think your next campaign slogan has to be this: \u2018We got to start eating babies! We don\u2019t have enough time! There is too much CO2,\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy that you really are supporting New Green Deal, but it\u2019s not enough, you know. Even if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cToo much pollution, so we have to get rid of the babies! That\u2019s a big problem. We need to eat the babies!\u201d she declared.\n\nOcasio-Cortez did not address the woman\u2019s plea to \u201ceat the babies\u201d specifically, telling her that \u201cwe need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuckily we have more than a few months. We do need to hit net zero in several years,\u201d the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member said.\n\nUpon the initial report, Breitbart News noted that it was unclear if the woman was a genuine supporter or someone spoofing the socialist lawmaker.\n\nThe extremist, antisemitic LaRouche PAC\u2013 the same group that was responsible for Obama-Hitler posters, which the Tea Party was wrongly blamed for \u2013 claimed responsibility for the woman\u2019s bizarre performance.\n\nLaRouchePAC trolls AOC, AOC doesn't rule out eating babies. #EatTheBabies https://t.co/bD9ThZVcGO \u2014 Lyndon LaRouche PAC (@larouchepac) October 4, 2019\n\nIts founder, Lyndon LaRouche Jr. \u2013 who ran for president eight times between 1976 and 2004 (often as a Democrat) \u2013 touted a swath of bizarre conspiracy theories and created a cult-like following.\n\nAs the Times of Israel details:\n\nHis conspiracy theories included a claim that the International Monetary Fund was \u201cengaged in mass murder\u201d by spreading AIDS through its economic policies, that former secretary of state Henry Kissinger and former vice president Walter Mondale were Soviet \u201cagents of influence\u201d and that the Queen of England was involved in the drug trade.
