Harbaugh said Monday the plan was to be aggressive against the Chiefs.\n\nANTONIO BROWN BACK TO SCHOOL AT CENTRAL MICHIGAN AFTER PATRIOTS RELEASE\n\n\u201cI have a good understanding of the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very detailed and well thought out. I think I was pretty clear about it last night, but we\u2019re standing by our decisions. Our decisions gave us the best chance to win the game in that particular game.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThese are not league average choices. These are determined by this game and for this game specifically, in that venue, weather is even factored into it. There\u2019s a lot of factors that go into it that are mathematically calculated. And that\u2019s why we did it. It wasn\u2019t a field position game. It was a possession game. And making the most of each possession was what counted and that\u2019s what we were attempting to do and for the most part we did a really good job of it.\u201d\n\nPANTHERS RULE QB NEWTON OUT FOR WEEK 4 GAME AGAINST TEXANS\n\nHarbaugh defended going for two points when the team was down 11 in the fourth quarter. The Ravens failed to convert the two-point try. Harbaugh said cutting the lead down to nine points would have helped their chance of winning the game.\n\n\u201cGetting it to 9 gives you a much better chance of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still have a chance to do that with the second two. And if for some reason they happen to kick a field goal or score a touchdown, it also enhances your odds. So while you may think getting to 10 is the thing to do, it\u2019s the thing to do if you want to go to overtime. It\u2019s not the thing to do if you want to win the game in regulation, and that\u2019s what we were trying to do.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 aggressiveness during the game was an attempt to counter the Chiefs' fast scoring.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKansas City outscored Baltimore 23-0 in the second quarter.
