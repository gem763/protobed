An ANGRY AOC lashes out while defending her pricy hairdo proving she kinda sorta TOTALLY missed the point", "language": "en", "text": "As Twitchy reported earlier, Jessica Valenti took it upon herself to white knight for poor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who got a really expensive hairdo which made the news. Of course, Valenti made it about sexism (which it really wasn\u2019t) and from reading AOC\u2019s tweets after the fact, she totally missed the point as well.\n\n40 million Americans live in poverty under today\u2019s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures. Our policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They\u2019re just mad we look good doing it \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/l9gKGtyKra \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nYeah! How dare people pick on her for being a total hypocrite.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, she looks good while she\u2019s being a hypocrite so there\u2019s that.\n\nWon\u2019t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* \u2013 not personal ones \u2013 to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses. I wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color. https://t.co/xBze4obZhv \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nWow, she seems upset about the article on her hair.\n\nWhat a chick reaction (this editor is a chick too, calm DOWN).\n\nAnd seriously, AOC, let us know when Pence or any other Republican starts pushing socialism and complaining about how we don\u2019t give enough money to the government to give to the poor.\n\nYes. We think you are all corrupt, irresponsible, ignorant, and greedy. ALL of you. \u2014 Jared Winkles (@TheRealWinkles) October 10, 2019\n\nYou would know sbout shady campaign finance, arrangements, wouldn\u2019t you, @AOC? Oh, and how\u2019s Saikat doing? Well, I hope? pic.twitter.com/IqlUtX7rIJ \u2014 Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) October 10, 2019\n\nOuch.\n\n\"ignorant and hypocritical\" is the new \"looking good\" \u2014 Dan (@LawoftheGator) October 10, 2019\n\nWant to compare poverty in America versus poverty in Venezuela? \u2014 Aaron R (@notwitty30) October 10, 2019\n\nYou think someone making $38,000 a year is poverty. Maybe you make too much money. \u2014 BirdGang19 (@bird_gang18) October 10, 2019\n\nThe irony.\n\nWe\u2019re still waiting to hear how you\u2019re going to pay for it. \u2014 William Waring (@billwaring) October 10, 2019\n\nPerfect.\n\nRelated:\n\nAnd THIS is why we don\u2019t take any of them seriously \u2013> Check out the silly things Dems have voted to advance impeachment over\n\nNothing but NET! Brit Hume uses piece from The Babylon Bee to DUNK on the NBA /China and ouch\n\nYA\u2019 THINK?! Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s response to new evidence State Dept official may have been \u2018monitoring\u2019 journos is PERFECT", "description": "Let us know when Pence and other Republicans are pushing socialism, AOC.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alexandria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
