They did not cite even one example where an abortion, the intentional killing of a living child in utero, would be superior to delivering that child.\u201d\n\nIn such cases, the baby may not be old enough to survive outside the womb, but the posts by LiveAction and Ms. Rose made that clear, saying that an early delivery only offers the preterm baby a \u201cfighting chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn early-term delivery, a preterm delivery, is not an abortion,\u201d Ms. Rose said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nConservatives have weighed in on LiveAction\u2019s behalf.\n\nRepublican National Committeewoman Harmeet K. Dhillon called Facebook\u2019s decision \u201cabsolutely sick and evil,\u201d while the Susan B. Anthony List called it \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d and Radiance Foundation\u2019s Ryan Bomberger said it was \u201cbogus censorship.\u201d\n\nIn its notice giving LiveAction a \u201cfalse rating,\u201d Facebook said that it \u201creduces the distribution of misleading content while also showing additional reporting on the same topic.\u201d\n\nIn June, LiveAction said its account had been banned by Pinterest for providing \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201charmful content.\u201d A Pinterest whistleblower reportedly was fired after turning over documents to Project Veritas showing that LiveAction had been placed on a list of blocked pornography sites.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
