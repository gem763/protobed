The men, however, are served blue menus which provide pricing details for all items.\n\nThe popular tourist destination defended the practice as allowing women \u201cto enjoy a romantic evening with their partner, without taking into account the cost of the services.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe owners of La Rosa Nautica did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press but denied that the practice should be considered discriminatory while defending the restaurant before a tribunal.\n\nAuthorities found otherwise, ruling that the restaurant has been discriminating against women.\n\n\"These small things may seem harmless,\" Liliana Cerr\u00f3n, an official with the agency that issued the fine, said Monday. \"But at the end of the day they are the basis of a chauvinistic construct reinforcing differences between men and women.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe National Institute for the Defense of Free Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property disagreed with the restaurant's practice. In a 3-2 ruling last week, it declared that women should have \"access to the same list of dishes with prices included.\"\n\nIn addition to the fine, the restaurant will have to immediately begin offering men and women the same menu with prices, train staff and post a sign clearly stating that discrimination will not be tolerated.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A restaurant in Lima, Peru, has been accused of sexism and ordered to pay a fine.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/peru-restaurant.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
