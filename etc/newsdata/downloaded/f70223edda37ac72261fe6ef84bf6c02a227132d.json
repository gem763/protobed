And as the civil rights attorney who helped establish the Rooney Rule \u2013 which requires NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations jobs \u2013 he understood the deeper significance of the moment for a league that long has excluded African Americans from its most important and celebrated on-field position.\n\n\u201cKyler Murray showed maturity beyond his years,\u201d Mehri said. \u201cThey had no running game. The stadium is so loud. It was 100% on him. And he carved up the defense.\n\n\u201cThen you look at Lamar Jackson. His field awareness was so impressive. He can sense the pass rush and escape. He places the ball with nice touch. He\u2019s showing the complete game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to overcome 100 years \u2013 literally 100 years! \u2013 of stereotyping of black quarterbacks. And they demolished all of them in that one game.\u201d\n\nAs the NFL celebrates its centennial season, the league is experiencing a changing of its quarterback guard. Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck are retired. Eli Manning has been benched. Ben Roethlisberger is out for the season, and faces an uncertain future.\n\nHealth permitting, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Phillip Rivers continue to truck along \u2013 but each is far closer to the end of their careers than the beginning.\n\nAll of those players are white. Meanwhile, the NFL\u2019s most promising and accomplished young signal-callers are predominantly black: not just Jackson and Murray, but also Dallas\u2019 Dak Prescott (26 years old), Houston\u2019s Deshaun Watson (24), and Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes (24).\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. As Jason Reid of The Undefeated has noted, 2019 marks the first year in which the league\u2019s reigning MVP (Mahomes), No 1 overall pick (Murray), highest-paid player (Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson), and a former MVP (Carolina\u2019s Cam Newton) are all African American quarterbacks.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that Reid\u2019s website has declared this \u201cthe year of the black QB\u201d. Yet that same excellence raises a question: given that roughly 70% of NFL players are African American, why has it taken so long for the league\u2019s marquee position to begin to follow suit?\n\nThe answer lies in a lengthy history of overt discrimination and subtle bias \u2013 and a determined, multi-generational effort by black athletes to overcome both.\n\n\u201cHow do you get from there to here?\u201d Mehri says. \u201cYou build a wall of integration. Bit by bit. Brick by brick.\u201d\n\nSeparate and unequal\n\nThe NFL\u2019s story began with a standout African American quarterback: Fritz Pollard, a chemistry major and All-American at Brown University, led the Akron Pros to the league\u2019s inaugural championship in 1920.\n\nIn 1933, however, the NFL secretly decided to ban black players \u2013 reportedly at the behest of former Washington owner George Preston Marshall, a committed segregationist who in a 1942 interview argued that if African Americans were allowed to play, \u201cwhite players, especially those from the South, would go to extremes to physically disable them\u201d.\n\nThe ban mirrored the status of black Americans at the time: separate, unequal and living in a de facto apartheid state via Jim Crow in the South and a patchwork of exclusionary laws and customs everywhere else.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In 1968, Denver\u2019s Marlin Briscoe became the first black starting quarterback in pro football\u2019s modern era.

In the early part of the 20th century, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and sports sociologist, whites assumed that African-Americans lacked the physical stamina and emotional courage to excel at contact sports like boxing and football.\n\nAfter Jack Johnson became the first African American heavyweight champion in 1908 \u2013 and then defeated \u201cgreat white hope\u201d James J Jeffries in a 1910 bout that triggered white race riots across the country \u2013 that assumption morphed.\n\n\u201cYou had the Negro Leagues in baseball, and similar kinds of [segregated black] teams in football and basketball,\u201d Coakley said. \u201cSo what happened over time is that the racial ideology changed.\n\n\u201cWhites accepted that blacks were physically evolved, but decided that they were intellectually un-evolved \u2013 that they were actually lower on the ladder of evolution than white people, and somehow closer to our animal ancestors. And that\u2019s the ideology, the cultural context, that prevailed when the major sports in the US were desegregated.\u201d\n\nThough the NFL lifted the ban in 1946, opportunities for African American quarterbacks were almost nonexistent. George Taliaferro became the league\u2019s second ever black quarterback in 1950, and even made three Pro Bowls \u2013 but only as a rusher and receiver who never completed more than 16 passes in a season.\n\nThe league\u2019s third black quarterback, Willie Thrower, was given even less of a chance to make a mark. In 1953, the Chicago Bears inserted him for a single drive against the San Francisco 49ers \u2013 and after Thrower completed three of eight passes to put his team in the red zone, replaced him with white starter George Blanda.\n\nIn sportswriter William C Rhoden\u2019s book Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback, Thrower\u2019s son, Melvin, recalled that his parents owned a bar called \u201cThe Touchdown Lounge\u201d, with a picture of his father on the wall.\n\n\u201cOn the bottom, it said: THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL, 1953,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cPeople told him to take it down. \u2018You\u2019re lying,\u2019 they said. \u2018You\u2019re lying. That ain\u2019t you. Take it down.\u2019\u201d\n\nStacked deck\n\nAs football and American society continued to desegregate in the 1960s and 70s, the sport was rife with what sociologists call \u201cracial stacking\u201d \u2013 a sorting process in which individuals are funneled into certain positions based on stereotypes.\n\nFrom Pop Warner to the NFL, the down-the-middle positions of center, inside linebacker and quarterback were considered to be \u201cthinking\u201d spots. As such, they were seen as too cerebral for African American athletes, who additionally were thought to lack the leadership and grit to lead other players and perform under duress.\n\nOf course, this was balderdash. Sandy Stephens quarterbacked the University of Minnesota to a national championship in 1960, and many other black signal-callers at the game\u2019s lower levels proved perfectly capable when called upon; meanwhile, plenty of white quarterbacks tossed interceptions, made boneheaded mistakes and otherwise labored in utter mediocrity.\n\nNevertheless, stacking had a pernicious, two-pronged effect: drastically reducing the pool of African American college quarterbacks who conceivably could be signed by a NFL team, and making it almost impossible for one of them to get a fair shake in the league.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest By winning NFL games with his arm and his legs, Philadelphia\u2019s Randall Cunningham helped change attitudes toward black quarterbacks with fleet feet. Photograph: Owen C Shaw/Getty Images\n\nKen Shropshire, who competed with and against African American quarterbacks in a predominantly black high school league in Los Angeles, experienced stacking for the first time while playing for Stanford University in the 1970s. Black teammates James Lofton and Tony Hill both had been prep signal-callers. Both were converted to wide receivers in college.\n\n\u201cI learned that was a regular thing,\u201d said Shropshire, the CEO of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University and author of the book In Black and White: Race and Sports in America. \u201cIronically, we had a contest in practice for who on the team could throw the ball the longest. James Lofton would win every year.\u201d\n\nWhen Denver drafted Marlin Briscoe in 1968, the Broncos told Omaha University\u2019s star quarterback that they wanted him to play defensive back. Briscoe had other ideas. Nicknamed \u201cthe Magician,\u201d he insisted that he wouldn\u2019t sign unless the Broncos allowed him to participate in a three-day quarterback tryout at the start of training camp.\n\n\u201cThey thought I was crazy,\u201d said Briscoe, who grew up idolizing Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. \u201cIt was unheard of to see a black man play QB in the pros. But all I wanted to do was showcase my skills.\u201d\n\nThe tryout, Briscoe said, went as he expected. Seven other quarterbacks, all of them white, got to make 10 throws during drills. Briscoe always went last, and got \u201cmaybe seven or eight\u201d.\n\nAt the end of camp, Denver named Briscoe a starter \u2013 at cornerback. But after starting quarterback Steve Tensi was injured and backup Joe DiVito struggled during the Broncos\u2019 home opener, coach Lou Saban put Briscoe in under center.\n\nBriscoe completed his first pass for 22 yards. He later drove Denver 80 yards, scored on a 12-yard run, and nearly led the Broncos to a comeback win. A week later, he became the first black starting quarterback in pro football\u2019s modern era \u2013 and ultimately finished the season as the runner-up for AFL rookie of the year, compiling five starts, 1,589 passing yards, 308 rushing yards and 14 touchdown passes.\n\nThe following summer, Briscoe went back to Omaha to take college courses. His phone rang. \u201cDenver was having quarterback meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cHere I am, the starting QB at the end of the season, and I didn\u2019t even get an invitation to the competition.\u201d\n\nBriscoe flew to Denver. He discovered his services under center were no longer needed. \u201cI never did get an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I understood what was going on.\u201d He ended up in Buffalo, where he played receiver and was named All-Pro before winning two Super Bowls catching passes for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBriscoe never played quarterback in the NFL again. But he had broken an important barrier. \u201cWhen I got to Denver, it was always thought that you\u2019d have a fan backlash, a player backlash, that whites wouldn\u2019t root or play for a black quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, that was a myth.\n\n\u201cMy offensive line, they were all from the south. Not only had they never played for a black QB, but prior to the pros, they had never played with black players. And the first thing out of their mouths was, \u2018don\u2019t let \u2018em touch the Magician.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor them to embrace me, for the fans to embrace me, that was validating. And I knew that I had to succeed. If I didn\u2019t prove that I could do it, then how long would it take for another black quarterback to get a chance?\u201d\n\nForward progress\n\nOther trailblazers followed. James \u201cShack\u201d Harris \u2013 Briscoe\u2019s roommate and mentee in Buffalo \u2013 became the first African American quarterback to start a NFL season opener, start and win a playoff game, play in the Pro Bowl and be selected Pro Bowl MVP.\n\nIn 1978, Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to be selected in the NFL draft\u2019s first round. Nine years later, he made history again by starting and winning the Super Bowl with Washington.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Washington\u2019s Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to be selected in the NFL draft\u2019s first round ... and the first to start and win the Super Bowl. Photograph: Rick Stewart/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, Warren Moon \u2013 who went undrafted after wining a Rose Bowl with the University of Washington \u2013 won five straight championships in Canada before signing with the Houston Oilers and embarking on a prolific 17-year NFL career that made him the first black quarterback inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nLike Briscoe, the African American signal-callers who came after in the 1970s and 80s couldn\u2019t be merely average. They had be exceptional. They were given less time to develop than their white peers, and less leeway to make mistakes. They also had to fight against a racialized conception of how a pro quarterback was supposed to play.\n\nTall, statuesque pocket passers were the gold standard. Shorter, more mobile ones were seen as fragile and unreliable. Coming out of college football, white quarterbacks tended to fit in the former category, black quarterbacks the latter.\n\nAccording to former NFL player and sports historian Mike Oriard, it\u2019s no coincidence that the 6ft 4in, 235lb Williams wasn\u2019t considered much of a running threat \u2013 or that Williams\u2019 college coach, Grambling State legend Eddie Robinson, told Harris not to run the 40-yard dash for league scouts, the better to avoid a positional switch.\n\n\u201cThe rise of black quarterbacks created the idea of the white quarterback,\u201d said Oriard, an emeritus professor and dean at Oregon State University. \u201cBefore the stereotype emerged that black QBs were athletic, there were no distinctive characteristics associated with white quarterbacks.\u201d\n\nBy winning NFL games with their arms and their legs, Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick helped change attitudes toward black quarterbacks with fleet feet. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, white signal-callers who could run and scramble, like Fran Tarkenton and Steve Young, were seldom disparaged as merely \u201cathletic.\u201d)\n\nConcurrently, the evolution of the pro game turned a perceived liability into a strength. As passing became paramount and pass rushers faster and more punishing, quarterbacks who could escape the pocket, make throws on the move and turn surefire sacks into gains became increasingly valuable.\n\nAt the college level, black quarterbacks have become much more commonplace: since 2010, at least one African American signal-caller has started in the national championship game. Mehri believes that has produced a trickle-up effect in the NFL, as social science research indicates that companies are nearly 200 times more likely to hire a minority candidate if the finalist pool for a job includes more than one minority.\n\nOf the league\u2019s 90 quarterbacks currently active or on injured reserve, 19 (21 percent) are black \u2013 which means African Americans remain underrepresented at the position. Nevertheless, Shropshire believes that the gap is closing, and that the league is as close to being an on-field meritocracy as it has ever been.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who follow this closely, the moment you sort of know is when you can no longer name all of the black quarterbacks in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happened for me a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\nBrick by brick\n\nSome bias still lingers. A 2004 study of football scouting publications found that white athletes were more likely to be praised for mental abilities, while blacks received physical compliments. A pair of 2017 studies found that white and black college students were more likely to describe pro quarterbacks in stereotypical ways than not, and that whites in general assigned stereotypes to black signal-callers but not to white ones.\n\nIn 2009, an economics professor examined NFL data from the previous decade and concluded that black quarterbacks were roughly two times more likely to be benched than their white peers when controlling for factors including injury, age, experience, and performance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes threw for 50 touchdowns, 5,097 yards and had a 113.8 QB rating last year, becoming the youngest player to win the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player award since Dan Marino in 1984. Photograph: Kirk Irwin/Getty Images\n\nTwo years ago, a Guardian analysis of the previous seven league drafts showed that the average pick for a black quarterback was 70th overall as opposed to 53rd for a white quarterback \u2013 even though those same black quarterbacks had a career passer rating slightly above 90.0, higher than the average rating for their white counterparts.\n\n\u201cIt takes a couple of generations to change the legacy of racial ideology,\u201d Coakley said. \u201cIt\u2019s dying a slow death. And we may be at a point where it is grasping to its last breaths.\u201d\n\nTell that to Baltimore\u2019s Jackson. Prior to the draft, veteran NFL executive Bill Polian suggested that the youngest-ever Heisman trophy winner would be better off playing receiver in the pros, while others raised concerns about Jackson\u2019s ability to read defenses.\n\nIn response, Jackson declined to run the 40-yard dash for scouts. He opened this season by throwing five touchdown passes in a 59-10 victory over Miami, then told reporters, \u201cnot bad for a running back.\u201d After out-dueling Murray, he had Ravens coach John Harbaugh deliver a more pointed message, one more brick in a wall of integration: not bad for a quarterback.\n\n\u201cTo see how these kids have evolved from the era I played in and dispelled the myth that a black man could not think and throw and lead at that level, it\u2019s just gratifying,\u201d Briscoe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far. And it\u2019s a long time coming.\u201d", "description": "As the NFL celebrates its centennial season, a rising vanguard of African American quarterbacks is shattering stereotypes at a position once considered off-limits", "authors": ["Patrick Hruby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99ad4c1d82532eb5d86ea1e4f415340fed6059b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3123594a4c37bdf2be5448567e9b2fc5", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
