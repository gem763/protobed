The company has since backtracked on its plans, saying that it will make expansions at the end of the year when the government reform plan for the services is expected to be finalized.The government\u2019s proposal officially recognized some new mobility services while also giving the government control over the number of taxis that could be operated by the service providers. Tada operator VCNC has expressed disapproval of the plan.VCNC said in a statement Wednesday, hours before the planned protest, that more discussions are needed with taxi organizations before the reform plan is introduced by the end of this year.Tada has rapidly grown since its launch last October.According to the company, it saw an average of more than 10,000 users per month and drove a total of 35.5 million kilometers (20.8 million miles) over the past year.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
