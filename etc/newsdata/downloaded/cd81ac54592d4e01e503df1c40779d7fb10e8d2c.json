As we saw and read this weekend even the airline crews don\u2019t know exactly how to respond to this new decree and it\u2019s a bit the same for the markets. That is a bad sign and shares are feeling the pressure.\u201d\n\nStock prices had risen on both sides of the Atlantic in recent weeks on enthusiasm about a pro-business Trump agenda.\n\nBut traders said the financial markets don\u2019t like this current focus on immigration reform and travel restrictions.\n\nThe dollar was down against the safe haven currency the Japanese yen and airline shares suffered.\n\nAmong the losers in Europe were International Airlines Group \u2013 which owns British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling \u2013 as well as Air France KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair and easyJet.\n\nIn the US, the likes of American, Delta and United Continental took big hits; and even planemakers Boeing and Airbus were lower on Monday.", "description": "Nervous investors sold shares on Monday because of uncertainty about the effects of the immigration curbs introduced by the new US president.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/356476/1000x563_356476.jpg", "published_at": "2017-01-30"}
