It\u2019s my home race and I always feel very proud to see Formula 1 back in Mexico. We\u2019ve just had the notice that the race contract has been extended for another three years, which is great news for the sport and for Mexico.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody tells me how much they love the race \u2013 my colleagues, the media and the fans. It\u2019s our chance to show everybody the Mexican way of life and how much we love sports.\n\n\"The track is a pretty challenging one \u2013 especially when you consider we are driving the cars at a high altitude. It\u2019s tough on the drivers physically and it\u2019s hard work for the power unit as well because the air is so thin.\n\n\"I think the final sector is my favourite part of the lap - the fast and flowing section, which can be very tricky, and it\u2019s easy to make a mistake through there. Because of the altitude, you have much less downforce on the car and the car can sometimes get quite loose through those fast corners.\n\n\"The final sector also has the stadium section and when it\u2019s full of fans the atmosphere is like nothing else. Each time I drive through there, even during practice, I can hear the fans and feel their support.\n\nAn energetic atmosphere\n\n\"Overtaking is never easy, but I think the best opportunity is into Turn 1 \u2013 that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen most of the moves being made.\"\n\nImage: Mark Thompson / Getty Images\n\nLANCE STROLL: \"Mexico is a really fun event. The fans are great and they really help make the race special with the atmosphere they create. Even on the Friday, you see full grandstands and can feel the energy of the crowd,\" says Stroll.\n\nREAD | Bottas wins Japanese GP, Mercedes clinch record constructors' title\n\n\"Away from the track, the city is awesome too. It\u2019s a busy place, with lots going on, and I definitely enjoy exploring and trying the Mexican food \u2013 you can\u2019t beat a good taco! I\u2019ve obviously been to Mexico City a few times now for the race, but I also visited Punta Mita a few years ago for a holiday and played on the golf course. It\u2019s a beautiful place.\n\nImage: Sport Pesa Racing\n\n\"Mexico City is up there as one of my favourite circuits of the year. I enjoy driving the car in high altitude conditions and you can really notice the difference because the car feels more nervous. It just adds another challenge for the drivers.\n\n\"It\u2019s quite a simple track \u2013 sort of like a go-kart track with some long straights linked by some low-speed corners. It\u2019s quite technical in places and there are overtaking opportunities. I think we have good potential in the car for these final few races and Mexico should suit us quite well,\" he concludes.\n\nTeam principal and CEO Otmar Szafnauer is also looking forward to the Mexican grand prix, its atmosphere and also a good Chimichanga.\n\nSzafnauer says: \"Mexico has been a fantastic addition to the calendar and, over the last five years, has become one of the most popular races of the season.\n\n\"The atmosphere inside the circuit is unlike any other and, away from the track, we\u2019re treated to some great hospitality. I don\u2019t think you can beat a good Chimichanga! As a team, we enjoy great support in Mexico \u2013 especially because it\u2019s a home race for Sergio \u2013 and the energy of the crowd is something that the whole team feeds off.\n\n\"We expect to be competitive and to be fighting for points on Sunday. The car has evolved significantly over the last couple of months and Mexico City is another chance to demonstrate the progress we have made recently.\u201d", "description": "All roads lead to Mexico this weekend as the next round of Formula 1 races commences.
