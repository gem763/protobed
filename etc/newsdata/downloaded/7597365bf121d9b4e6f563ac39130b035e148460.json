They\u2019ll run mostly on Facebook and YouTube.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do via our Gun Safety President campaign is put these candidates directly in front of the gun safety voters and let them decide for themselves,\u201d Peter Ambler, the executive director of the organization, told VICE News. \u201cAcross the country at kitchen tables, people are talking about keeping their communities safe, keeping their kids safe, not impeachment.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden speaks about consoling police officers who responded to the Sandy Hook shooting. \u201cIt just enraged me,\u201d he said. He directly calls out gun manufacturers and the NRA, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s wrong. They should have more of a conscience the manufacturers, they should have more of a conscience, the NRA.\u201d\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) speaks about \u201cyoung black and brown men\u201d killed by police, while Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) clings to a message of hope that he witnessed on the streets of Newark.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s this many Americans dying every single day, it should demand for those of us who love this country, it should demand that we are instruments of hope, and never giving into despair, never surrendering to cynicism about this problem,\u201d Booker says.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg described his own experience as a high school student during the Columbine shooting \u2014 and how little has changed in the twenty years since.\n\n\u201cIt is the expectation of the American people that something will happen and what is dangerous is to allow more lives to be put at risk due to inaction on something as important as our safety and security,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s the second set of videos that the group has released featuring the Democratic presidential field. The first series of mashup video ads aired in September with more than $200,000 in backing, and garnered 10 million views online. Giffords also purchased $300,000 in digital ads just last week targeting Republicans in Virginia.\n\nAmbler says the three states are more than just good targets for early and important places in the presidential primary process. Colorado and Texas \u201chave deep and relatively recent histories with tragic instances of gun violence. They\u2019re states where gun safety is top of mind.\u201d\n\nThe six-figure purchase comes as the gun control debate has fizzled in Washington, D.C. after a summer of deadly shootings and a brief opening from the White House when President Trump expressed interested in working with Democrats to stop deadly and mass shootings.\n\nBut in the months since, lawmakers like Sen. Chris Coons (D-Conn.) have lost hope that a package of laws can pass soon. Even Democrats in the presidential race have disagreed over have to best handle some specific policy points in the gun control debate.\n\nButtigieg and O\u2019Rourke sparred at the recent Democratic debate last week when Buttigieg criticized O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposed policy of a mandatory buyback of assault weapons as a \u201cshiny object,\u201d and not a practical solution to gun violence.\n\n\u201cI think the energy and passionate that Beto is bringing to this primary and debate over guns are illustrative of the anger and passion that many Americans feel,\u201d Ambler said, though the mandatory buyback is not a position that his organization has backed. \u201cWe have different policies that we have laid out to deal with assault weapons in circulation.\u201d\n\nCover: Former U.S. Rep.
