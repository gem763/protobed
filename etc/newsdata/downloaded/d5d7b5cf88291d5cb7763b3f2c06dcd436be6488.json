But Snoop is, in fact, a fan of Cave\u2019s, via the BBC One show Peaky Blinders. The British gangster series uses Cave\u2019s 1994 hit \u201cRed Right Hand\u201d as its theme, so of course, Snoop had to cover it for the upcoming fifth season. Somehow, it\u2019s better than all the show\u2019s past covers of the song, which range from Arctic Monkeys to PJ Harvey to fellow stoners FIDLAR. Wearing the requisite flat cap, Snoop says, \u201cBy the order of the Peaky Blinders, this is \u2018Red Right Hand,\u2019 by Snoop Shelby! Check it out,\u201d referencing the show\u2019s gang leader Tommy Shelby. Call it \u201cGangsta Luv.\u201d The video mixes clips from the show with footage of Snoop toking up and laying down bars in the studio, as Snoop actually raps Cave\u2019s lyrics \u2014 adding some say what\u2019s for good measure. \u201cHe\u2019s a god, he\u2019s a man, he\u2019s a ghost, he\u2019s a guru\u201d? Lyrics written about Snoop Dogg, for Snoop Dogg. Nick Cave is shaking.\n\nRelated", "description": "BBC One show Peaky Blinders uses covers of Nick Cave\u2019s hit \u201cRed Right Hand\u201d as its theme, and Snoop Dogg contributed his own.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-snoop-dog-peaky-blinders-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
