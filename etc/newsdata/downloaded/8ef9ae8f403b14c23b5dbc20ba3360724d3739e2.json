Totally cool to have a plant out there on the outskirts of Cairns that can cause brain nerve damage and organ failure.\n\nAs per The Guardian, the Poison Fire Coral fungus has been spotted by a nature photographer in the suburb of Redlynch just outside of Cairns, a surprise to fungi followers and fun guys, considering it was assumed the bright red growths were only native to Japan and Korea.\n\nThe poisons from the fungus are apparently absorbed through skin contact, which can result in dermatitis at the point of contact, and eating it can result in symptoms that range from vomiting, fever, stomach pain, through to brain nerve dysfunction via shrunken cerebellum (your brain shrinks), voluntary movement issues, speech impediments, and death due to multiple organ failure.\n\nNot to mention the hair loss, skin peeling, blood clots, severe loss of white blood cells and platelets, and changes in perception.\n\nIt\u2019s also apparently the only poisonous fungus that can hurt you if you touch it, so that\u2019s nice.\n\nIn short, just leave this thing the hell alone, or it\u2019ll fuck you sideways through to next week.\n\nSince 1999, there have been a couple of recorded deaths of fools who have eaten both dried and sake-soaked versions of the fungus, both of which were recorded from different areas in Japan.\n\nThose that have been poisoned and treated successfully have basically had to have their systems flushed intravenously with immense amounts of fluid, as well as blood plasma treatment. It\u2019s just not worth it and I\u2019m now second-guessing my desire to lick the forbidden fungus.\n\nIn any instance, if you think you or someone you know has been in contact or \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 eaten some of this cursed mushroom, call the Poisons Information Centre on immediately on 13 11 26.", "description": "One of the deadliest types of fungus has been found in Australia, after it was thought to only be native to Japan and Korea.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/poison-fire-coral-fungus-fb.jpg"}
