But long before he was Greg Hirsch, Braun went up for the role of a lifetime: titular character Henry in 2001 Showtime TV movie Walter and Henry. So, the guy\u2019s been a big star since before he was famously six-foot-seven on HBO. On The Ellen Show, the now-31-year-old recalled leaving his successful audition with his dad at just 11 years old, all the while trying not to knock over Ellen\u2019s coffee table with his limbs. \u201cThere\u2019s other kids around who are still up for the job, so we don\u2019t talk, you know?\u201d Braun sets it all up. \u201cWe go down the elevator, we go outside. It\u2019s in New York City. He looks at me. It\u2019s like swirling outside. It\u2019s loud, whatever, and I\u2019m buzzing. He goes, \u2018So, how\u2019d it go?\u2019 And I put my hands up like this. He puts his hands down like this. And I go, \u2018I fucking nailed it, Daddy!\u2019\u201d He fucking nailed it, Daddy. Poetry. If that\u2019s not in the script for Succession season three, then I assume papa Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) has been blood sacrificed, leaving Greg to take over. At least, that\u2019s what Ellen\u2019s gunning for.\n\nRelated", "description": "\u201cSuccession\u201d star Nicholas Braun talks being a child actor and Cousin Greg\u2019s future while on \u201cThe Ellen Show.\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-nicholas-braun-ellen.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
