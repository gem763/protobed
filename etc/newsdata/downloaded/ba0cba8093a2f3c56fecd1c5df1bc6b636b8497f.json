That meant the prorogation was \"void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued.\"\n\nThe unambiguous verdict from the U.K.'s highest court is a severe political blow to Johnson. He is accused of effectively lying to the queen and trampling on parliamentary sovereignty. In the short term, the most tangible impact is that MPs will be back at work on the green benches Wednesday. Speaker John Bercow announced shortly after the verdict that parliament would resume business at 11:30 a.m. \u2014 (almost) as if nothing had happened.\n\nThat means Brexit-skeptical MPs can harry the government with urgent questions to ministers and searching committee inquiries. They can keep demanding answers about the progress of the Brexit talks and the government's preparations for no deal with the power to force ministers to come to the despatch box. And all that scrutiny will be launched from what MPs regard as a lofty moral high ground.\n\nBut aside from increasing the political volume in Westminster, what impact will it have on Brexit? In the short term, not much. MPs already managed to rush through legislation which they believe prevents Johnson's government from pursuing a no-deal Brexit. So on the face of it, Johnson's best option is still to achieve a deal with the EU that can win enough parliamentary support to allow the U.K. to leave on October 31.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, the court's judgment appears to close off one potential option for No. 10 Downing Street \u2014 a further prorogation to force through a no-deal Brexit. Given the unambiguous nature of the judgment (and the fact that it was unanimous) that is surely now off the table.\n\nThis insight is from POLITICO's Brexit Files newsletter, a daily afternoon digest of the best coverage and analysis of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU available to Brexit Pro subscribers.
