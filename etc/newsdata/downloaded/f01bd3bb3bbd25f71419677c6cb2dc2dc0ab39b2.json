Well, my phone, obviously. But I'd rather live without it. I do like my noise-cancelling headphones though. Those are a godsend on planes.\n\nWhat app do you open the most and why? Instagram or the news. Both are mindless scrolling, though, ugh. I do love WhatsApp. Lots of my friends are across loads of different timezones and I find it's the easiest way to keep up with them.\n\nShiv, Snook's character in \"Succession\", is a master manipulator.\n\nIt\u2019s your birthday. How are you celebrating and with whom? It's December 1 and I've either \"forgotten\" to organise anything or I'm drinking tequila with my close friend Ande, who shares the same birthday as me.\n\nIt\u2019s 5pm. What are you drinking? Tequila. Kidding! Margaritas.\n\nOK, it\u2019s 8pm, what are you drinking now? Now it's straight tequila.\n\nEveryone has a guilty pleasure, what\u2019s yours? Tequila. No, I'm kidding. It's Van Leeuwen's salted caramel ice cream. Have mercy.\n\nLast binge-watch? Euphoria. Whoa.\n\nLast book you read? Conversations With Friends by Sally Rooney (along with everyone else).\n\nWhat book did you tell everyone you read but secretly may have skimmed? Can't skim. Physically impossible. I'm a full-cream book reader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone\u2019s doing karaoke, including you. What\u2019s your song? Doo Wop (That Thing) by Lauryn Hill. Everyone knows the chorus, and I taught myself the rap.\n\nIf you could choose it, your last meal on this earth would be \u2026 Right now? The whitefish and pickle sandwich from Bakeri in Greenpoint. Can't. Stop. Eating. Them.\n\nIf you had an entirely free day, with no prior commitments, what would you do? Walk around with my Olympus OM-2 taking photographs.\n\nSnook's character Shiv, along with her brother Kendall (Jeremy Strong), is a strong contender to take over their father's media empire in \"Succession\". Fox Showcase\n\nIf you could, which chore would you give up forever? Cooking dinner. Ugh. So boring.\n\nWhat\u2019s the nicest present you\u2019ve ever received? A boyfriend once made me a mini rocking chair out of matchsticks.\n\nFavourite city? Melbourne, hands down. Then New York City and London, tied for second.\n\nLuxury is \u2026 No one knowing you have a day off but you.\n\nSeason two of Succession is airing on Fox Showcase now.\n\nThe heritage issue of LUXURY is out on Friday, September 6 inside The Australian Financial Review.
