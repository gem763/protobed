Starting in November, the rush-hour bus lanes on H and I streets NW will be extended, in effect from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. (Luz Lazo/Luz Lazo)\n\nAfter three months of testing rush-hour bus lanes in a busy downtown corridor, the District is making the lanes permanent and extending their hours of operation.\n\nThe bus lanes on a stretch of H and I streets NW in downtown carry as many as 70 buses an hour during the peak morning and evening hours. City transportation officials say the speed of buses has improved since the bus lanes launched in June, creating more reliable trips for the thousands of riders.\n\n\u201cWe have seen public support for the bus lanes operating in rush hour, and we think there is significant benefit to extending them,\u201d said Jeff Marootian, director of the District Department of Transportation.\n\nStarting Nov. 12, the lanes\u2019 hours of operation will be 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. That is a significant change from the current hours, 7 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nDDOT is also creating loading zones on the opposite side of the bus lanes \u2014 on the south curb of I Street and the north curb of H Street \u2014 to accommodate delivery trucks that have been affected by the lanes. It will also change some signal sequencing and operations to address the heavy volume of right turns in some locations and move bus layover spaces outside the bus lane to create smoother bus operations.\n\n[Poll: Washington-area residents support bus-only lanes]\n\nThe District is also evaluating automated traffic enforcement for the bus lanes to address violators. Officials and transit advocates say success of the transit lanes depends on consistent enforcement to get drivers to respect the rules. The city has been towing vehicles parked in the lanes during the peak hours and ticketing violators. The fine for driving or parking in the bus lane is expected to be $200.\n\nSome transit advocates say the enforcement has still lagged. On a Wednesday last month, transit activists recorded nearly 300 violations using the How\u2019s My Driving app.\n\n\u201cThe bus lanes are great, but there is room for improvement,\u201d Mark Sussman, co-founder of the How\u2019s My Driving app, wrote in an analysis of the Aug. 21 bus lane enforcement blitz.\n\nMarootian said the city will be implementing the changes in coming weeks and doing more public outreach to let drivers know about the new rules of the road.\n\nTaking away the lane for the entire day will reduce curbside parking, with the loss of dozens of parking spots during those hours.\n\nThe I Street bus lane starts at 13th Street NW and ends at Pennsylvania Avenue NW; the H Street lane stretches from Pennsylvania Avenue NW to 14th Street NW. The lanes have added about 1.4 miles of bus lanes downtown.\n\nThese are the city\u2019s most significant segments of dedicated bus lanes. A decade-old plan for dedicated bus lanes along 16th Street NW is on track for implementation next year, and the city is pursuing a $122 million plan to redesign K Street NW to add about two miles of bus lanes by 2025.\n\nBicycles, charter and school buses, and marked taxis are allowed to use the lanes. Other vehicles are allowed in the lanes to make a right turn.", "description": "The bus lanes on a stretch of H and I streets NW in downtown carry as many as 70 buses an hour during the peak morning and evening hours.", "authors": ["Luz Lazo", "Transportation Reporter Covering Washington'S Metro", "Buses", "Capital Bikeshare", "Taxis", "The Region'S Road Network", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hVxGQQLQiVrfXsFfIZlRG-xAk18=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MKYXD2KEDFEP3KRVXVMRXKOUCM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
