Photo: YouTube\n\nBeginning this month, the \u201cThis Week in Web Videos\u201d column will be appearing once every four weeks as a roundup of the most noteworthy work that\u2019s crossed our Twitter feeds, in-boxes, and browsers during that time. This month, we\u2019ve got a lovely little potpourri of old faithfuls and brand-new voices, featuring live-action, animation, theater performances, and high-production-value short films. Oh, and Tom Cruise. Basically.\n\nTom Cruise 2020 (Presidential Campaign Announcement), by Miles Fisher\n\nThe first time I watched this video, I honestly thought it might be Tom Cruise, and I was confused why actor Miles Fisher had sent it to me (I didn\u2019t know at the time that he\u2019d played Cruise before, in Superhero Movie and Entertainment Tonight). That\u2019s how good Fisher\u2019s Cruise impression is. In this faux 2020 presidential campaign ad, Fisher\u2019s every intonation and movement is pitch-perfect. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about low-hanging fruit like Christopher Walken or Morgan Freeman here. Tommy\u2019s tough to do, and this short deserves all the attention it\u2019s getting. Oh, for another mindblower and a little trot down memory lane, check out his Christian Bale.\n\nRecording Booth, by Dad\u2019s New Apartment\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a looping misdirect sketch \u2014 you know, one of those in which a character thinks they\u2019re doing something right, only to find out they\u2019re actually doing it wrong, and, try as they might, it keeps happening again and again and again. These sorts of little comedy puzzles can be downright magical if executed right. Sketch group Dad\u2019s New Apartment has indeed executed with a recording-studio sketch in which Edgar Winter (Jacob Gerstel) lays down undeniably strong vocals for his hit \u201cFree Ride,\u201d only to have the audio engineer (Courtney Paige Barnett) and record exec (Griffin Patrick Davis) tell him his performance needs work \u2026 even though they appear to be absolutely loving it when he\u2019s singing. Get what a looping misdirect sketch is now? Good, because I just made up that term. Sort of makes sense though, yeah?\n\nFosse Bomb Squad, by House of Birds\n\nNew York\u2013based UCB Maude team House of Birds imagines what it\u2019d be like if a bomb beeping on the twos and fours confounded the city bomb squad and could only be diffused by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a team of Fosse-trained jazz dancers familiar with that two-four time beat. Delight as much in Nate Bennett\u2019s writing as Iman Richardson\u2019s impressive moves and Mary Cait Kelly and Brian Morabito\u2019s bumbling bomb-diffuser shticks.\n\nConcealer, by Kristine Gerolaga\n\n10 days to make a short film? No problem. Follow this filmmaker\u2019s journey on Fire TV. Posted by ATTN: on Friday, June 28, 2019\n\nPart of an Amazon FireTV and ATTN co-produced short-film initiative, Concealer seems like it may only be available to people who have Prime memberships, which admittedly is kind of annoying. We\u2019re including it because it introduced us to writer-director-actor Kristine Gerolaga who, in an impressively stylized effort, has crafted a short about beauty-product pyramid schemes that features one of the best short performances this year, thanks to a turn from Stacie Gancayco-Adlao as an unhinged \u201cCherry Cheeks\u201d makeup saleswoman. Is this the Latinx Get Out? Probably not, but it\u2019s really fun and establishes Gerolaga as a creator to watch.\n\nThe Good Samaritan, by Felipe Di Poi Tamargo\n\nFelipe Di Poi Tamargo is no stranger to our column, and videos like The Good Samaritan should clear up why. With a rapier wit and the illustration skills to create worlds that terrify as much as they entertain, Tamargo is a treasure in waiting. In this one, a mild-mannered Scandinavian man leaves increasingly alarmed voice-mails for a person he\u2019s never met, letting them know that he\u2019s found their phone number on a slip of paper and will not, under any circumstances, lose said number. What happens when he does? All hell breaks loose. Well, in a mild-mannered Scandinavian way.\n\nLuke Kelly-Clyne is executive producer and head of development at Big Breakfast and a watcher of many web videos.
