Tanya Wildt, Detroit Free Press\n\nMichigan-based North Bay Produce is voluntarily recalling several varieties of apples for possible Listeria contamination.\n\nNearly 2,300 cases of fresh Michigan apples and two bulk bins that were distributed in eight states are part of the recall because they are potentially contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, the company said in a news release.\n\nRecalled varieties include McIntosh, Honeycrisp, Jonathan, Fuji, Jonamac and Red Delicious apples. The apples were sold in plastic bags under these brands: Great Lakes, North Bay Produce Pure Michigan as well as unbranded in clear plastic tote bags, white paper tote bags, and individually from retailers' display trays.\n\nThe apples were shipped between Oct. 16-21 to wholesalers, retailers and brokers in Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nXanax recall: Generic Xanax drug, Alprazolam, recalled for 'potential presence of a foreign substance'\n\nBeefy recall: Taco Bell recalls 2.3 million pounds of seasoned beef from restaurants in 21 states\n\nA full list of the recalled apples is available at www.northbayproduce.com. (Photo: North Bay Produce)\n\nThe recall was initiated after a product test revealed that finished products contained the bacteria, the release states. No other North Bay products are affected by the recall and the company said it is \"not aware of any illnesses linked by health officials to this recall.\"\n\nA full list of the affected apples along with descriptions and photos has been posted at www.northbayproduce.com/recall.\n\nIf you have the recalled produce, the company is advising not to consume it and to either discard or return the apples to place of purchase.\n\nConsumers with questions may call 231-929-4001, Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time, visit www.northbayproduce.com or email recall@northbayproduce.com.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exposure to Listeria bacteria can cause serious or fatal infections in children, elderly people and those with compromised immune systems. It also can cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women. Healthy individuals may experience high fever, severe headaches, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n\nFollow Susan Selasky on Twitter: @SusanMariecooks.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2019/10/28/north-bay-produce-recalls-apples-over-listeria-risk/2492144001/", "description": "More than 2,000 cases Michigan apples, including popular varieties like Honeycrisp, are being recalled due to potential Listeria contamination.", "authors": ["Susan Selasky", "Published P.M.
