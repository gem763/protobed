However, Jones refused to directly accuse the All Blacks of being behind the clandestine activity.\n\nResponding to an unrelated question from a reporter at England's new base out at Tokyo Bay, he said: 'I think you've got a long range camera. So you were the bloke up in the apartment block today filming.'\n\nEddie Jones has claimed England were spied on in training ahead of All Blacks semi-final clash\n\nJones said someone was filming in the apartment blocks overlooking the Arcs Urayasu Park\n\nJones suggested the 'spy' might have been a Japanese fan, but laughed off the incident\n\nWhen he was asked to clarify what had happened, Jones added: 'There was definitely someone in the apartment block filming, but it might have been a Japanese fan. We don't care, mate. We knew it from the start, but it doesn't change anything. We love it. It's part of the fun of the World Cup. We have got someone there (at New Zealand training) now mate!'\n\nJones has spoken before about the issue of teams spying on each other in the run-up to Tests, but he said: 'I haven't done it since 2001. I used to do it. You just don't need to do it anymore. You can see everything. You can watch everyone's training on YouTube.\n\n'There's no value in doing that sort of thing \u2013 absolutely zero. Everyone knows what everyone does \u2013 there are no surprises in world rugby anymore. You just have to be good enough on the day.'\n\nJones dishes out instructions to Anthony Watson and Ruaridgh McConnochie on Tuesday\n\nThe England coach was in a provocative mood as he talked about the semi-final showdown\n\nEngland's head coach was in his element as he attempted to unsettle the All Blacks ahead of the momentous last-four encounter. Jones sought to make life uncomfortable for Steve Hansen's side \u2013 who are seeking to claim a third successive title \u2013 while alleviating any weight of expectation on his own players.\n\n'We get to play one of the greatest teams ever that are shooting for a \"three-peat\", which has never been done, so that brings an element of pressure,' he said. 'We don't have any pressure. No-one thinks we can win.\n\n'There are 120million Japanese people out there whose second team are the All Blacks. So there's no pressure on us, we've just got to have a great week, enjoy it, relax. Train hard and enjoy this great opportunity we've got, whereas they've got to be thinking about how they're looking for their third World Cup and so that brings some pressure.\n\n'It's our job to take the time and space away so that we put them under pressure. New Zealand talk about walking towards pressure, well this week the pressure is going to be chasing them down the street. That's the reality of it; that's how we're approaching it.\n\n'Pressure is a real thing. The busiest bloke in Tokyo this week will be Gilbert Enoke \u2013 the (All Blacks') mental skills coach. They have to deal with all this pressure of winning the World Cup three times and it is potentially the last game for their greatest coach and their greatest captain, and they will be thinking about those things.\n\n'Those thoughts go through your head. It is always harder to defend a World Cup and they will be thinking about that, therefore there is pressure.'", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: Jones (top right) claimed that someone was spying on England's training session from the apartment block (pictured above) overlooking Arcs Urayasu Park.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/07/20022664-0-image-a-13_1571725653749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
