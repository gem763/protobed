He says the big danger is not flooding, but wind\u2014and that some wind gusts have reached the 70-90 mph range.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger to life and property but the good news is the storm is starting to pull away from Southern New England,\u201d Deger says. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to see some strong winds with gusts as high as 40-50 mph but I think the strongest winds are in the past in places like Boston and Providence.\u201d\n\nAs of 8:47 a.m. on Thursday, more than 225,000 customers in Massachusetts alone had lost power, according to the state\u2019s emergency management agency.
