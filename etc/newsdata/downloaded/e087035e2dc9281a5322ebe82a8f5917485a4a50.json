I won\u2019t let my daughter feel the same.", "language": "en", "text": "My 4-year-old daughter, Lucia, and I play a game inspired by the classic children\u2019s book \u201cAre You My Mother?\u201d by P.D. Eastman. It\u2019s the story of a baby bird whose mother is off finding food when he comes into the world. Not wanting to be alone, the bird goes to find his mother, asking, \u201cAre you my mother?\u201d to everyone he meets \u2014 a kitten, a dog, a boat, even a bulldozer.\n\nFirst, I play the hatchling who cracks open to find itself alone in the nest. I curl up on our couch pretending to be an egg while my daughter sits on top of me, \u201cI must get something for my baby bird to eat,\u201d she exclaims and runs off to another room. Thrusting my nose in the air, I pretend to crack open. \u201cI\u2019m born!\u201d I say and look around. Then in distress I ask, \u201cWhere is my mommy?\u201d At which point I announce, \u201cI am going to go look for her.\u201d I hop off the couch and search the apartment going from room to room bumping into my toddling daughter, \u201cAre you my mommy?\u201d I ask. She rolls her eyes, \u201cNoooo, I\u2019m a kitten.\u201d We go through them all, a hen, a dog, \u201cAre you my mommy?\u201d I ask again. She toddlersplains, \u201cNoooooo, I\u2019m a coooooowwwww.\u201d With no luck I return to our nest and Lucia comes back to the couch, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d she asks. \u201cYes,\u201d I squeal. \u201cI do. I do know who you are. You are a bird. And you are my mother.\u201d We are finally reunited. I feel a surprising sense of satisfaction and then it\u2019s gone.\n\nLucia and I act out the hatchling and the mommy over and over, taking turns in each role. We enact these separations and try on the idea that we may not come together but then it\u2019s affirmed that indeed we do. Each time she rediscovers me, she\u2019s happy. Our game addresses a fear that all children have of being abandoned. I relish in her joy at our reunion but our game leaves me feeling sad.\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, my father killed himself. He was gone and when I looked out at the world, I searched. Like the baby bird, for years I searched, but for my father who wasn\u2019t there. There were many candidates. My SAT tutor, an acting teacher, therapists, innumerable boyfriends and older gay men of a certain age.\n\nEspecially older gay men of a certain age. My father was gay, but I didn\u2019t know until I was 10. I suspect his hiding a central part of himself led to his despair, and his death. When I meet these men, the young girl inside me leaps forward in anticipation of some longed-for connection. She doesn\u2019t dare speak it out loud, but the girl without her dad is there asking, \u201cAre you my father?\u201d\n\nOn the subway, I see two gay men wearing wedding bands. A warm sensation floods my body. Gay people can marry. Then I feel a stab of envy, a bitter resentment that they live in a world my father didn\u2019t get a chance to inhabit. In an instant I\u2019m mourning again, not just for my dad but the other life I lost the day my father overdosed \u2014 the life where I got to have a dad. If he had lived in a different world, my father might still be alive.\n\nI stare too long at a handsome gray-haired man in yoga and a gay man in the cafe with the perfect shade of washed jeans that are just the right width (not too skinny like a hipster, not too wide like my husband\u2019s). If we end up in conversation, I ask questions, questions swollen with urgent, pulsing need. Do I make them uncomfortable? Maybe.\n\nIs that what happened with a Cuban friend of my father\u2019s? Married and eight months pregnant, I showed up for coffee so we could finally meet. He had read about my one-woman show about searching for my father\u2019s piano in Cuba and contacted me. He knew my dad for two years before he died. According to him, they weren\u2019t lovers \u2014 just fast friends. He adored my father and when he learned about my show, sought me out. \u201cI\u2019ll be the one wearing the red carnation,\u201d he wrote in his email before our scheduled coffee.\n\nSeated in the restaurant I saw a version of my father walk toward me. Dark and dashing, even in his late 60s, slim and fit, with the body of a dancer and olive skin. I loved him even though we hadn\u2019t yet spoken. I sat there with an unrealistic expectation in place, a hope I forever have to manage and set aside. He told me stories of my father \u2014 a pianist \u2014 taking him to galleries and salons and introducing him to all things cultural in Manhattan. I imagined this dear friend of my father\u2019s taking me to the theater and the ballet. Since the beginning of my pregnancy, I had noticed my sadness compounding \u2014 not only was I fatherless, but my daughter wouldn\u2019t have a grandfather. Here, seated in front of me, was the person who could be both.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t lost your father after all,\u201d he said as we parted,\u201d I have you now!\u201d But we got together only once more. At his house in East Hampton with his husband, my own husband and daughter in tow. \u201cAre you my father?\u201d was the question between my questions as we talked that day. Could he see it in my eyes? Is that what ended things? I left knowing that would be it. Did I scare him away?\n\nI might as well be a baby bird and Bernardo may as well be a kitten, a hen or a dog. He is not my father.\n\nThe other day, my daughter asked, \u201cAre you sad your daddy died?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d I confessed. She hugged me, \u201cBut I\u2019m here now, Mama.\u201d\n\nYes, she is. Instead of a gray-haired gay man, it\u2019s my relationship with my daughter that\u2019s teaching me what I need to know, giving me what I need. Not the father replacement I wished for, but a tiny, curly haired, gummy bear-gobbling, sleep-resistant imp with an upturned nose. I have received an unexpected, un-asked for blessing, a kind of miracle do-over. As I provide Lucia with a safe base she can return to, I am made whole. Playing the game \u201cAre You My Mother?\u201d Lucia learns relationships continue in the face of separations, and so do I. My old wound of being abandoned is healing \u2014 finally. It\u2019s not always easy. Feeling the love between us reminds me of the immensity of feeling I had for my father and the bond that was broken the day he died. I didn\u2019t get enough of him \u2014 that will always be the case. But the relationship I didn\u2019t get to live out with my dad, I repair in some small measure every day with my daughter. And I make sure, every single day, that she gets enough of me.\n\nAdelaide Mestre has performed in numerous theatrical productions, musicals, cabarets and films including Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cHusbands and Wives.\u201d Her award-winning show, \u201cTop Drawer,\u201d was first presented at the New York International Fringe Festival and has since been produced at New York\u2019s Symphony Space, the American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora in Miami and numerous cities nationwide.\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.
