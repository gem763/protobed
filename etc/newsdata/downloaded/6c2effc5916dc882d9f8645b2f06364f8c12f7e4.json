So on a whim, the South Korean entrepreneur decided to make a 38km trip from Busan to Ganjeolgot by foot.\n\nThe exercise sparked a passion that would change his life: the more he walked, the less stressed he felt.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to find the answer when I was sitting down. But I always found the answer when I walked,\u201d Lee says.\n\nNow, Lee walks thousands of kilometres around the country each year, and gives lectures on his unique style of speed-walking.\n\n\u201cMy bigger dream is to walk across tall the beautiful cities around the world and share my knowledge with other people.\u201d\n\nVideo journalist: Kwon Moon\n\nCamera: Sang Hyun Lee\n\nMotion graphics: Yong Hae Ahn", "description": "After business troubles burned him out, on a whim Seowon Lee walked 38km to a nearby city.
