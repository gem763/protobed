Going through this experience has opened my mind up to a lot of things.\u201d\n\nChamp, until now best known as the longest driver on the PGA Tour, carded a closing three-under-par 69 at Silverado Resort in California wine country.\n\nHe finished at 17-under 271 for his second PGA Tour victory in 34 starts, one shot ahead of Canadian Adam Hadwin.\n\nHadwin almost spoiled the script, erasing a three-shot deficit in the final two holes.\n\nHe rolled in a 15-foot birdie at the 17th and then a four-footer for another birdie at the par-five 18th for a 67.\n\nChamp, who had bogeyed the par-four 17th after misjudging his short approach shot, suddenly found himself standing in the 18th fairway tied for the lead after a 370-yard drive.\n\nBut he missed the green with his eight-iron second shot and was in serious danger of falling into a playoff until a deft chip set the stage for the winning putt, which he stroked in dead center.\n\nChamp, who hails from nearby Sacramento, started the round with a three-shot lead over a trio including Hadwin.\n\nA six-foot birdie at the first hole settled Champ\u2019s nerves, at least until the last couple of holes.", "description": "Californian Cameron Champ survived a late scare before sinking a four-foot birdie putt at the final hole for an emotional win at the Safeway Open in northern California on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
