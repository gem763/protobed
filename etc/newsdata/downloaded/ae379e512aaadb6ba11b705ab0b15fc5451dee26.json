You could see that team-mate David Pocock was relieved when the referee just went for yellow.\n\nEddie Jones\u2019s England side will strike ruthlessly if Australia continue to lose the plot and show such ill-discipline.\n\nAustralia have a poor discipline record since the sin bin was introduced in 19 years ago\n\nThey will make any numerical advantage count and Owen Farrell will not endure another middling kicking afternoon like he did against Argentina. Penalties will be costly.\n\nBut this quarter-final is going to be tough. Australia are doughty World Cup fighters and when they bring their A game \u2014 like they did two months ago when they thrashed New Zealand \u2014 they are formidable.\n\nThey have a much improved scrummage which got the better of the Georgian pack yesterday and their lineout is solid. The basics are in place, they just haven\u2019t finessed their attacking game plan. Yet.\n\nBut Eddie Jones and his men must be wary of the threat of Australia during big tournaments\n\nIt almost sounds ridiculous because we are talking about Australia, but England must not underestimate them from their form in Japan so far.\n\nWatch the tape of that Rugby Championship game with New Zealand in Perth from August to see the real Australia.\n\nEven though Australia were not wildly impressive yesterday I can guarantee you Michael Chieka will be happy they got through the game safely.\n\nTheir thrashing of New Zealand in August will come as a strong warning against the English\n\nBLOWN OFF COURSE? FAR FROM IT\n\nEngland have been well and truly away from the eye of the storm \u2014 geographically and metaphorically \u2014 at their luxury camp in Miyazaki which Eddie earmarked some years ago as their base.\n\nThe forecast there for the weekend is 32 degrees and sunny, and their quarter-final in Oita next week is set to be similarly hot. Eddie has done his homework well.\n\nI\u2019m a little uneasy at England having a two-week lay-off now they\u2019re in tournament mode, as players and teams are creatures of habit and finding tournament rhythm is important.\n\nJones has been meticulous so far and well prepared for the conditions of Japan this autumn\n\nBut England haven\u2019t burnt up any nervous energy over these last few contentious days.\n\nThe World Cup officials made an early call to cancel the game against France. England lost no time in heading for the airport and flying to their favourite retreat before the weather closed in. They have been low-key, under the radar and they have not involved themselves in the politics.\n\nEngland also have a chance to rest a few with bruises and strains, and if Billy Vunipola recovers from his ankle knock they will have all 31 players to select from next week, which is all a coach can ask.\n\nThey can now train in the sunny climates of their Mikayazi base ahead of the quarter final\n\nJack Nowell is back looking fit and eager, Henry Slade as well. Everybody is raring to go.\n\nYou suddenly become a very good coach indeed when you have a full squad to pick from!\n\nEngland\u2019s form is really good, they have gone along very nicely, upped it a little bit against the Pumas last week and have the potential to move up two or three gears. They have avoided major injuries, cards, controversy, and nobody has been posting silly stuff on social media.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: England will make any numerical advantage count and Owen Farrell will not endure another middling kicking afternoon like he did against Argentina.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/19/19602254-0-image-a-58_1570818181834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
