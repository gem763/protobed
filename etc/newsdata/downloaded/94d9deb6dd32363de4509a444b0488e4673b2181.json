But Pam thinks quite the opposite and knows that she is seeing something in Callum Highway (Tony Clay) that would make Ben genuinely happy.\n\nSpeaking about Pam\u2019s return to the Square, Lin Blakely told Metro.co.uk: \u2018She\u2019s come back to get the books as she does from time to time. Once she comes back, she wants to see everyone she loves and the first person she wants to see is Ben. Obviously, she wants him to move on, I feel. She hopes that he is. It was terrible what happened to Paul but Pam knows he needs to move on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think she senses the love Ben has for Callum. All I will say is that she wants to see Ben move on. She wants him to be a happy soul \u2013 she loves him very much so she really wants him to live his life. And she tells him Paul would want him to do that too. There are some lovely scenes in that. Pam is what Ben needs at the moment to tell him that!\u2019\n\nThe last time that Pam had scenes with Ben, he was played by Harry Reid but it\u2019s clear Lin has love for both actors who have taken on the role.\n\nShe reflected: \u2018I had such a lot with Harry and now we have this new Ben. He\u2019s a different actor and another lovely actor, he knows what he is doing. We clicked straight away \u2013 I was Auntie Pam straight away so it was so lovely. The relationship with Ben is still there. And the bond is still there with Max.\n\n\u2018We did a very together scene and it really clicked; even the director said \u201coh my goodness, we could have taken that first take!\u201d It was lovely for both of us. To click with an actor like that being thrown into a scene with someone he doesn\u2019t know, it was definitely a lovely Pam and Ben situation. You just never know, do you? We had said hello to one another and that was it \u2013 he is such a good kid.\u2019\n\nSince leaving EastEnders, Pam has very much kept in touch with her Coker clan \u2013 comprised of Roger Sloman (Les) and Jonny Labey (Paul), who is currently competing in Celebrity X Factor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told us: \u2018Roger and I see every six to eight weeks for a coffee if we can and we text each other \u2013 he\u2019s coming to see this play. And we saw me in a play in London \u2013 we support one another very much. You can\u2019t be a Les and Pam without having that bond I don\u2019t think. We were sincere about that relationship. You don\u2019t just share that and just say cheerio. You stay in touch.\n\n\u2018She accepted his cross dressing, he explained what happened to him as a child with his father \u2013 things happen in life, don\u2019t they? Pam has accepted that, and it wasn\u2019t a bad thing \u2013 but in another sense, now that he\u2019s away from London, perhaps she feels he can be more comfortable in himself and his crossdressing more, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s still storylines to tell with them. What happened with her son? No-one completely knows that! It might get unfolded sometime.\u2019\n\nAnd she is supporting Jonny on X Factor, in the hopes that it could open some more exciting doors for him.\n\nShe grinned: \u2018Isn\u2019t he brilliant!? I saw him on Strictly and then I saw a review at the Hippodrome \u2013 he\u2019s an absolute showman. Something big might come out of this. He might go to Vegas, who knows. He has so many talents, he\u2019s great on the guitar \u2013 I hope something big happens out of this, he deserves it and he\u2019s a lovely kid. He still keeps in touch with his nan, so that\u2019s nice!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the big question is \u2013 would Lin like to bring Pam back to Walford for good?\n\nShe enthused: \u2018If the opportunity came up to have Pam back permanentely, I\u2019d be there in a heartbeat. I loved it so much. Coming in through this gates and seeing the boys on the gate was lovely. To have that everyday \u2013 it was part of my life for three years and it came at a time it was needed in my life \u2013 that would be gorgeous.\n\n\u2018I came on a three month contract and stayed three years \u2013 and that was because of the fans; they kept us there. To be accepted like that is heartwarming, it takes your breath away. I mean that sincerely.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s like a nan to a lot of characters in the Square. It\u2019s lovely to bring her back so she can see everyone, it\u2019s a blessing and I am thankful for it very much.\u2019\n\nWhen we told Lin that fans would certainly be behind that and had been sharing excitement at the prospect of another Pam stint, she was genuinely chuffed and added with surprise: \u2018I don\u2019t do any social media \u2013 probably I should! Are people really excited? How lovely!\u2019\n\nWho\u2019s setting up the petition, then?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Pam is back in business!", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Week-45-EXCLUSIVE-Pam-and-Ben-d309_1571936536.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
