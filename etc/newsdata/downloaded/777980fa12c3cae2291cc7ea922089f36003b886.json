When you hear a guy like that who\u2019s the greatest of all time, it\u2019s kind of funny. Since we\u2019ve been on this stage, we've heard a lot of retired guys chiming in on this generation of basketball player and evaluating talent and saying their generation was better and all that. It\u2019s a great conversation for the fans to get in on. I know I\u2019m in good shape for that, but I still have a lot to prove to myself.\"\n\nCurry\u2019s coach Steve Kerr, who played on some of the championship Bulls teams with Jordan, was also asked about the 10-time scoring champion\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI think Michael has his own version of the Hall of Fame,\u201d Kerr said, according to 95.7 The Game. \u201cIt's in his own head ... whatever that is, then that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nJordan made the comments in an interview on \u201cToday.\u201d Curry\u2019s Hall of Fame status came up after he was asked whether he would change who was in his lineup for a pick-up game. Jordan said he would choose Hakeem Olajuwon, Magic Johnson, Scottie Pippen and James Worthy and wouldn\u2019t change the lineup.\n\nWhen asked whether Curry should be offended by the list, Jordan said he hoped not.\n\n\u201cHe's still a great player,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cNot a Hall of Famer yet, though. He's not.\u201d\n\nCurry is one of the best three-point shooters of all-time. He\u2019s already won three NBA championships, two MVP awards and has been named to an All-Star team six times.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHis teams beat the greatest basketball of this generation \u2013 LeBron James \u2013 for three of those titles.", "description": "\"I think I\u2019m good, but then I\u2019m never complacent,\"\u00a0Stephen Curry said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/curry-jordan-Getty.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
