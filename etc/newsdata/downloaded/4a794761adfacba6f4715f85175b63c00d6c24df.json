As Garner continued to resist arrest and more backup came, a bystander captured the moment NYPD officers swarmed Garner, who was 6 foot 2 and about 400 pounds.\n\nThe footage also showed Mr. Pantaleo jumping on Garner\u2019s back and putting the suspect in a chokehold, which he continued as Garner was brought to the ground, as more officers came to help, Garner began screaming \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before dying.\n\nMr. O\u2019Neill said Mr. Pantaleo did everything right up until the chokehold, and he placed blame on Garner as well for resisting arrest\n\n\u201cEvery time I watch that video, I say to myself \u2026 \u2018to Mr. Garner, don\u2019t do it. Comply. Officer Pantaleo, don\u2019t do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said.\n\nNew York civil code Article 78 allows Mr. Pantaleo to challenge his firing from a government agency.\n\nMr. Pantaleo won\u2019t face any indictments in Garner\u2019s death as a Staten Island jury chose not to indict him in 2014 and the Justice Department said in July that it would not pursue the case further.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
