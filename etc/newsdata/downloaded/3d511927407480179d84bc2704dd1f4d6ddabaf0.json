And, when Trump was pressed on the alteration during a presser, he not-so-convincingly responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? You don\u2019t know? Are you sure about that? You don\u2019t think that you might have done it?!\u201d asked Oliver. \u201cI gotta say, for someone who lies so constantly, it\u2019s genuinely astounding how bad he is at it. There is a non-zero chance that, if he loses every state next year, he\u2019ll claim he\u2019s won by standing in front of a fully blue map with the word \u2018RED\u2019 written on it and Sharpie stains on his fingers.\u201d\n\nAs a White House aide confessed to The Washington Post, it was Trump who tweaked the map because \u201cno one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they don\u2019t! Trump is notorious for using Sharpies to fix things he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d said Oliver, before throwing to a printed-out Vanity Fair article by Juli Weiner, a current writer on Last Week Tonight, that had been marked up like mad in a Sharpie by none other than Trump.\n\n\u201cThis is my favorite part: circling her name and writing next to it \u2018bad writer,\u2019\u201d offered Oliver, before joking, \u201cAnd look, to be fair to him, I\u2019ve been saying the same thing to her for six years but I don\u2019t do it in Sharpie, I do it by ruthlessly demanding endless rewrites and being generally withholding of praise\u2014like a professional!\u201d", "description": "According to the \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host, it\u2019s \u201castounding\u201d how bad a liar President Trump is, after he tried to claim that a map he marked up was legit.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_731,w_1301,x_2,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568007372/Screen_Shot_2019-09-09_at_1.26.16_AM_fad9fb", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
