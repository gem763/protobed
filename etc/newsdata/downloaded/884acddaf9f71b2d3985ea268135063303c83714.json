Like, a**e, arms, thighs, even my knees. It is VERY annoying.\n\n\"My skin refuses to retain moisture. We\u2019re talking a THICK serving of Eight Hour Cream all over my face every single night, and still waking up to a bone dry boat.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Random loud hiccups at any time of day. Following no pattern, and with no warning- the runs. Maybe 5 times a day, maybe once a week. WHO KNOWS.\n\n\"I\u2019m still taking naps. I NEVER nap.\n\n\"The anxiety is real. Will I still be me when I\u2019m a mother? Will everything be ok? WILL MY KID BE A P***K\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAnd she finished off the long list of negatives with: \"Pregnancy is lonely. Oh, the headaches. The headaches.\"\n\nSlowly adjusting to pregnancy, Melissa admitted she's \"been lucky to avoid\" vomiting and constipation and confessed her leg hair growth has slowed down.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nNevertheless, Melissa told The Sun that she can't wait to be a mum.\n\nShe said: \"We're so excited to become parents.\n\n\"This next step is an adventure, and we\u2019re looking forward to raising a happy, healthy, inquisitive, strong, and accepting child, and starting our own little family, as a trio!\"\n\nCruise director Robert added: \"I'm over the moon but nervous too! Melissa is so used to kids, and she\u2019ll be an amazing mum instantly.\"", "description": "The former soap star has shared a list of pregnancy fears after announcing she's expecting her first child", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20668160.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Melissa-Suffield.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
