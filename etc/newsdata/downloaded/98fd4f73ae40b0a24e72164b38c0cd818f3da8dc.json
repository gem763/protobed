Edelman claims he once walked in on a naked Bill Belichick chilling in the Patriots\u2019 hot tub.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nEdelman described the scene in a five-minute video that was posted to his YouTube page Wednesday. The relevant portion of the conversation begins around 1:40.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Edelman explains, Belichick being in the hot tub naked was a \u201creal, real big party foul by coach.\u201d But after considering the situation, Edelman gave Belichick some leeway, saying, \u201cI guess at 11 o\u2019clock when you\u2019re the GOAT of coaching, you go wherever you want free.\u201d And just to make it clear, Edelman clarifies by saying \u201cfree ball.\u201d\n\nEdelman says he engaged in small talk with Belichick as the two were leaving the stadium. Edelman believes that was the second time he ever spoke to Belichick.\n\nSo, uh, yeah. Sorry for ruining your day with that story. We\u2019re not 100 percent sure why Edelman decided to share it. Maybe he\u2019s feeling secure about his position on the Patriots after he was named the Super Bowl MVP last season.\n\nBut if Edelman mysteriously gets cut Wednesday, or finds himself only playing five snaps Sunday, we\u2019ll have an explanation for it. Belichick has punished other players for less.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at christophercwik@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
