REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nGeorgia were unable to impose themselves on the game at the Hanazono Rugby Stadium and had no answer to Fiji\u2019s brilliant backs, who ran the Europeans ragged in the second half.\n\nWinger Semi Radradra was at the heart of all their best moves, scoring two tries and helping set up scores for centre Waisea Nayacalevu, scrumhalf Frank Lomani and fellow winger Josua Tuisova.\n\nIn all, the Fijians, who had lost their opening Pool D games to Australia and Uruguay, scored seven tries.\n\n\u201cOnce they get in behind you and get their tails up they\u2019re the best at throwing that ball around and scoring tries,\u201d Haig told a news conference.\n\nHe said the criticism the Pacific islanders drew from their upset loss to Uruguay had fired them up.\n\n\u201cPretty sure it did, speaking to their coaches beforehand, certainly they talked about it motivating them.\u201d\n\nWhile the defeat has not removed them from the quarter-finals equation altogether, Georgia will have to beat Australia in their final game to have any chance of getting through.\n\n\u201cOf course we need to be disappointed, this is not a performance we would have liked to put up for our fans and our family and our friends back in Georgia,\u201d said Haig.\n\n\u201cBut the reality is it\u2019s not what you\u2019ve done it\u2019s what you do next that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d\n\nHaig also felt Fiji wing Tuisova was fortunate to escape punishment after his arm caught Alexander Todua on the head late in the first half.\n\n\u201cDefinitely think it was an important moment in terms of the first half. It looked clearly on the replay it was around the head, and he was the last defender,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWould it have changed the match? Not sure. In the second half they got their tails up.\u201d\n\nGeorgia round out the group against the Wallabies on Oct. 11 in Shizuoka.", "description": "Georgia coach Milton Haig says his players were left bitterly disappointed by their performance after being thumped 45-10 by Fiji on Thursday but was confident they would be able to lift themselves off the floor to face Australia in eight days' time.", "authors": ["Peter Rutherford", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436581382&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920MR"}
