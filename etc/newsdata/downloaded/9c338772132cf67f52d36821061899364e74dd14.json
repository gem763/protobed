Planning is what armed forces do \u2013 and never more so when there\u2019s a tangible threat.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama has now said that containment isn\u2019t an option: Iran cannot be allowed to acquire a nuclear capability. It follows logically that armed force may have to be used to achieve that policy goal. Indeed, Obama has said explicitly that all options remain on the table.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOpportunity: The mounting storm in Syria may well be providential to the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in their planning for the strike on Iranian nuclear sites\n\nStrategy: With the Assad regime imploding, Syria's air defences could be seriously degraded, and Southern Syria may well now be the IAF's most feasible route into Iran via Iraq\n\nThe question for him is where is the red line: what is the critical point at which military force must be used? It would make a good episode of The West Wing. Seen from Tel Aviv, of course, the red line may be rather closer than seen from Washington.\n\n\n\nSo how does the turmoil in Syria help the IAF planners?\n\n\n\nThe IAF has over the past decade purchased 125 advanced F-15I (I for 'Israel' \u2013 McDonnell Douglas, now Boeing) and F-16I (Lockheed Martin) strike-fighters. The I variants are equipped with Israeli avionics and additional fuel tanks specifically for long-range strike missions. Indeed, the IAF\u2019s principal strike orientation has for the past ten years been towards Iranian nuclear capability.\n\n\n\nIt has bought specialised 'bunker-busting' munitions, developed long-endurance unmanned aircraft for target reconnaissance, as well as an air-to-air refuelling capability (ten large tankers based on the commercial Boeing 707).\n\nIts pre-emptive strike in June 1981 against the Osirak reactor near the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, is legendary. Less well known was its strike in September 2007 against a Syrian target believed by Israeli and U.S. Intelligence to be a nuclear reactor under construction. Both strikes stopped the nuclear programmes in their tracks, and then retarded subsequent research and development.\n\nArsenal: The IAF has over the past decade purchased 125 advanced F-15I (I for 'Israel' - McDonnell Douglas, now Boeing) and F-16I (Lockheed Martin) (pictured) strike-fighters\n\nHowever, a fully disabling strike against Iran would be far more complex. The Iraqi and Syrian strikes were against single targets located above ground \u2013 and they were 'bolts from the blue'.\n\n\n\nThe Iranian sites are buried deep, there are five that would probably have to be neutralized (Natanz and Fordo, Uranium enrichment plants; Arak, a heavy water plant; Isfahan, a Uranium conversion plant; and Parchin, a military site), and Iranian Air Defence has been put on notice for months.\n\n\n\nAnd the sites are, of course, at greater range than any previous ones. Far greater range. Multiple, deep-buried targets would require a large number of aircraft in a carefully coordinated operation; and access would have to be via other nations\u2019 air space.\n\n\n\nPrecautions: Israelis are exchanging old gas masks for new amid tensions over the possibility of Israel striking Iran over its nuclear programme\n\nHitherto it had been supposed that there were three options: via Turkey, Jordan/Iraq, or Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nIraq\u2019s air space is virtually undefended, so this would be the place in which command and control (C2) and refueling could be carried out; but transiting Jordanian air space, as well as being politically explosive, could be a hard-fought job.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia and Turkey would be even trickier, with the added complication that Turkey is a member of NATO.\n\n\n\nSyrian airspace has hitherto been regarded as perhaps the toughest nut to crack, technically, as well as Syria's being, too, the country most likely to share early-warning intelligence with Teheran. But with the Assad regime imploding, its air defences could be seriously degraded, and Southern Syria may well now be the IAF\u2019s most feasible route into Iran via Iraq.\n\n\n\nIronically, this is a window of opportunity that is only likely to open wider in the months to come; so for the time being it may well act as a brake on the IAF strike option. Ultimately, however, the Iranian 'red line' will not be determined by Damascus or the Syrian rebels \u2013 or even by the U.S. presidential elections; only by Teheran, as seen from Tel Aviv.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the IAF will continue to do its duty: training and planning to destroy the existential threat to Israel.\n\nVideo: 'Rebels attack and destroy government tanks'\n\n\n\n", "description": "ALLAN MALLINSON: With the Assad regime imploding, Syria's air defences could be seriously degraded, and Southern Syria may well now be the IAF\u2019s most feasible route into Iran via Iraq.", "authors": ["Allan Mallinson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/24/article-2193098-14AD1FA7000005DC-562_1024x615_large.jpg", "published_at": "2012-08-24"}
