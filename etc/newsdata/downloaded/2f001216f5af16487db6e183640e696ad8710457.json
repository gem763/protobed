This week, Louis Vuitton joined that small circle, creating a set of in-game League of Legends skins for the next League of Legends virtual band, True Damage.\n\nThe special skins were made by Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, the artistic director of women's collections for Louis Vuitton. Ghesqui\u00e8re didn't design all of the new skins for the virtual hip-hop group, only a couple of \"Prestige\" skins for Qiyana and Senna. Qiyana's Louis Vuitton skin will be available for players from November 10, while the Senna skin will be released early next year.\n\nLike K/DA, the virtual group that performed last year, True Damage will perform at the opening ceremony for the League world finals on November 10. The performances themselves will come from DUCKWRTH, Thutmose, South Korean rapper Soyeon, Keke Palmer, and Becky G. As for the in-game characters that make up the group, it consists of Ekko, Akali and Yasuo, along with Senna and Qiyana.\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nImage: Supplied\n\nThe Riot/Louis Vuitton partnership was announced last month, but the details weren't revealed until now.
