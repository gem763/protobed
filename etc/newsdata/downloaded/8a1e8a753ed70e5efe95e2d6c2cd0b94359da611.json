As he spent more and more hours honing his skills online, his grades at high school began to suffer which began to concern his parents.\n\n\"I was waking up when my parents would go to sleep, to go play some more League. So they had no know idea that I was awake during the night,\" he laughed.\n\n\"You know, it really sounds like real next level addiction or something right?\"\n\nEven so a professional career playing never seemed doable with the esports boom seemingly so far away from his hometown in Croatia.\n\nIt wasn't until he spent a summer playing a challenger series that both he and his parents realized the Perkz's potential.\n\nHaving joined G2 Esports in 2015 he now travels the world and his talents have seen him acquire a social media following reaching into the hundreds of thousands.\n\nLuka \"Perkz\" Perkovic (left) and Rasmus \"Caps\" Winther (right).\n\n'Always seen it as a job'\n\nIt's a route to the top that's not unfamiliar to Perkz's current teammate Rasmus \"Caps\" Winther who joined the team just last year.\n\nFor Caps, 19, the idea of a professional esports career was always in the back of his mind having grown up in a gaming mad family in Denmark.\n\nHis older brother was a professional Dota player which meant his parents were more sympathetic to his ambitions to make it in the competitive world of League, a game which he loved as soon as he picked it up.\n\n\"I think I've always seen it as a job,\" Caps told CNN Sport, from the Red Bull Gaming Sphere in London.\n\n\"Just because I've always aimed to be the best. I always knew that it takes.\"\n\nEven before turning professional, Caps was having to sacrifice a lot at a young age to maintain his level.\n\nLike Perkz, his grades began to suffer and Caps' free time outside of school was spent in front of a screen but all the hard work paid off as soon as he stepped on the big stage.\n\nIt was during a summer spent in Turkey where the Dane convinced both his parents and himself that this was where he belonged.\n\n\"It was kind of like a surreal experience. I still remember the feeling of making [the first] big play onstage,\" he reflected.\n\n\"You play so many League games [...] and then to play a game where you actually hear people clapping and you can see people at the back of the PC. It just feels different.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED G2 Esports' Wunder, Mikyx and Jankos on Worlds Replay More Videos ...

He blames his \"trolling\" for the backlash he received after enduring a difficult run of form in his first year as a professional.\n\n\"It really backfired on me like really, really, hard, in ways that I think many people can't even begin to imagine,\" he said, saying the abuse had made him reconsider a career in esports.\n\n\"I was getting blamed by thousands and thousands of people. I couldn't even go on the internet because it would be such a mental devastation every time I would read a comment.\n\nIt's a reality that Caps has also come to accept but fortunately for the players at G2 Esports, they can seek advice from its charismatic owner Carlos \"ocelote\" Rodr\u00edguez who, as a former pro, has helped his young gamers adapt to life in the limelight.\n\nElite esports is very much a mental game and players are often encouraged to take time away from the screen to allow their minds to reboot.\n\nFor Perkz, music is the tonic he needs to switch off. Having followed in his sister's footsteps, he is a trained classical guitarist and is grateful to have a hobby so different from his career.\n\n\"It's kind of really changed me in a way,\" he added. \"It's really relaxing for me to be able to have something [other] than League.\"\n\nEyes on Worlds\n\nBoth Caps and Perkz are now on the verge of doing something very special in the world of League of Legends.\n\nThe current team has won every tournament it's played in this year and is now one of the favorites to win the Worlds -- which starts in Berlin later this month and culminates in Paris in November.\n\nMany have tipped it to become the first European team champion of a competition historically dominated by Asia.\n\nHowever, neither players are worried about the extra pressure that comes with the lofty expectations and are aware they'll be the ones to beat.\n\n\"Yeah I can imagine, I think about it sometimes,\" Perkz said when asked whether he thinks about lifting that glittering trophy next month.\n\n\"I think about it more of like a motivation to just keep going. Because seasons are long for me, every season is very long and very taxing.\"", "description": "Luka \"Perkz\" Perkovic still remembers the first time he picked up a computer mouse.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191011125129-g2-caps-perkz-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
