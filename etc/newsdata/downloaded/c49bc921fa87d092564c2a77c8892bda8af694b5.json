A local resident filmed Mensah-Schramm\u2019s actions and reported her to the police.\n\n\u201cI did not do anything wrong,\u201d Mensah-Schramm told local broadcaster MDR Th\u00fcringen.\n\nWhile Ms Mensah-Schramm has previously been charged with property damage and associated offences, this is the first time she\u2019s been punished by a court.\n\nThe pensioner indicated she will appeal the ruling. Supporters have offered to cover her costs with crowd-funding campaigns launched online.\n\nWhen handing down the fine, the court told Ms Mensah-Schramm that she could avoid the fine by paying \u20ac500 to local charity organisations. She refused, arguing that to do so would be an admission of guilt.", "description": "A 74-year-old activist known as 'Graffiti Grandma' has been fined \u20ac300 (\u00a3260) plus court costs for painting over Neo-Nazi graffiti in the central German town of Eisenach.", "authors": ["Daniel Wighton"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212901742-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
