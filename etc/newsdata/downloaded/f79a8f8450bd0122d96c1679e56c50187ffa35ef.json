No. Should I get back to work? Yes.),' he added.\n\nThe original alien comedy was a hit worldwide, grossing $250.6million in the United States and Canada, and $338.7million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $589.3million.", "description": "Ed Solomon, the writer of the 1997 blockbuster Men in Black, took to Twitter Tuesday to tell about a rather awkward exchange with an unknowing pair of friends.", "authors": ["Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760214-0-image-a-13_1571174473146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
