On Tuesday this week, he was jailed for ten months after stealing \u00a35,000 from a 96-year-old parishioner \u2014 one of his loyal flock.\n\nThe court heard that Morris, the vicar of St Matthew's Church in Nottingham, had been looking after 96-year-old, wheelchair-bound Mavis Pennack's finances after she moved into a care home.\n\nSuch was her faith in the vicar that she entrusted her bank card and PIN to him. With the card in his possession, he paid no fewer than 20 visits to cash points in the two months leading up to her death and helped himself to her money.\n\nRev Edward Morris (pictured with wife Jackie when she was Sheriff of Nottingham) was jailed for ten months after stealing \u00a35,000 from a 96-year-old parishioner\n\nHe was caught only when the victim's stepdaughter, Sheila Smith, a retired audit clerk, checked Mrs Pennack's bank statements after her death and realised 'something wasn't right' and went to the police.\n\nOutside court, Mrs Smith, 82, said: 'For a man of the cloth to do that is abominable.'\n\nCertainly, it's a shocking story, particularly when you learn how Morris adopted the expected level of solemnity to preside over Mrs Pennack's funeral following her death in January 2017. Even worse, his wife \u2014 a former Sheriff of Nottingham no less \u2014 did not learn of his guilt until shortly before he first appeared in court.\n\nSpeaking to the Mail this week, Jackie, 74, a former Mayor of Nottingham as well as a former sheriff, was close to tears. 'This is a complete shock,' she said. 'I only found out about it all two weeks ago.'\n\nDescribed in court as an obsessive book collector, it was implied that it was this fatal weakness that led the vicar to steal. Perhaps he was attempting to fund the purchase of a collection of rare and weighty theological tomes.\n\nThe court heard that Morris (pictured), the vicar of St Matthew's Church in Nottingham, had been looking after the finances of one of his wheelchair-bound flock after she moved into a care home\n\nA troubling case, it seemed, of a good but misguided man of the cloth who felt compelled to steal to fund his scholarly pursuits.\n\nBut it was not like that at all.\n\nThe story of the Rev Edward Morris is actually more fantastical than even his most imaginative parishioners could ever have dreamt, as the Mail has discovered.\n\nFirstly, the 62-year-old is not known as the Rev Morris at all but as the more modern, approachable 'Andy' (his middle name is Andrew). Edward, it seems, sounded rather stuffy, which is not Andy's style at all.\n\nMorris is no shy, studious bookworm either, but a larger-than-life, hearty and hale fellow whose party trick is fire-eating. Indeed, he and his older wife are well known local characters.\n\nBut, of late, it is not the vicar's fire-eating skills that have been a talking point in the parish, but the seemingly unrelenting drama in his life. Fleecing an old lady of her savings is, it turns out, just a cameo in his story.\n\nWhile his wife might have been Sheriff of Nottingham, Morris, it turns out, was every bit a modern day Robin Hood, (albeit bypassing the 'giving to the poor' bit).\n\nAn area of abandoned scrubland in the less-than salubrious Bestwood housing estate, in the north of the city, is at the heart of this bizarre drama. It's a bleak, desolate spot, littered with debris and a couple of old wooden doors which have seen better days.\n\nSheila Smith (right) from Nottingham is the stepdaughter of Joan Pennack (left). She discovered her stepmother had been fleeced by her vicar when she checked Mrs Pennack's bank statements after her death\n\nOvergrown and desolate, there remain the remnants of two driveways, at the end of which are two areas of flattened earth which indicate that buildings, until very recently, stood here.\n\nIndeed, the larger patch was, until earlier this year, where the church of St Matthew stood, and beside it, on the other smaller patch, a smart red-brick house which was the vicarage.\n\nMorris was appointed the vicar of St Matthew's in 2004 and he and Jackie moved into the vicarage next door. Five years later, the church was targeted in an arson attack, causing \u00a3300,000 worth of damage.\n\nThere was no money to fund the restoration, so Morris moved his flock to the smaller, modern church of St Philip's, a few miles away in Top Valley. He and Jackie remained living in the vicarage, however.\n\nBut it seemed someone had it in for them. In 2017, Jackie's car was torched. She said afterwards it was a blessing she'd parked the car further down the drive than usual, or they might have been killed. She told her local paper at the time: 'It's just a metal shell now, it was burnt out completely. It was such a big inferno.\n\n'It would have blown this house apart if we'd parked it in the normal place, we are just lucky to be alive.'\n\nThere was yet more. On September 21 last year, not long after midnight, police and firefighters were called to a fire at the vicarage, a third case of suspected arson.\n\nNot long afterwards, Morris and his wife moved out.\n\nIn February this year, Mrs Morris posted on Facebook: 'Andy felt a little better so he went back to the vicarage to get the last of his tools to do a little job at home to find that someone had killed all the fish [neighbours say they had a fish pond], stolen all the garden furniture and tried to break into an empty house.\n\nNeedless to say, he is back to square one. They took our home, they almost took his life and now trashed 14 years of work to make a wonderful garden.\n\n'When is it going to stop?'\n\nEight months later, her husband was before Nottingham Crown Court \u2014 not as a witness in an arson trial, but facing charges of theft. So did someone have it in for this community vicar? If so, who? And why?\n\nHis younger brother, Simon Morris, has his own theories. The fact that 'Andy' is now in prison does not surprise him one little bit.\n\nSimon still vividly recalls the day when, as a teenager growing up in Bulwell, Nottingham, his father, who ran a fruit and veg business, told him his big brother had been caught shoplifting in Woolworths.\n\nThat rather set the pattern, claims his brother.\n\nHe says that, in his late 30s, his brother, who had lost his job in a dyeing factory, decided he wanted to be ordained into the Church of England but there was a problem: he'd had a very brief early marriage in his 20s (Andy married his first wife, Doreen, in 1978, just a year before he met Jackie). Jackie, to boot, was twice-divorced.\n\n'The Southwell diocese said at the time he could not be ordained so he got a job assisting a vicar in Coningsborough, near Rotherham.\n\n'Two years later, they were suddenly back in Bulwell and I later learned he had been asked to leave over a theft from a safe.\n\n'But somehow he managed to get in with the church again.'\n\n(These past misdemeanours were confirmed in court this week where it was revealed he'd been convicted of shoplifting in 1983 and in 2000 was cautioned by police after taking money from an employer's safe.)\n\nBut that wasn't the end of it. Only five years ago, says Simon Morris, there was yet another episode regarding money.\n\n'Jackie came round distressed saying Andy had falsified her signature for credit and debit cards and taken \u00a360,000.\n\n'We never found out why. Our mother tried to get it out of him but the shutters came down.'\n\nMeanwhile, no one has been convicted for torching the church, or vandalising the Morrises' home.\n\nThis week, the Mail spoke to Mrs Morris at the semi-detached property where she is currently living, the day after her husband had been jailed. Clearly distressed, she said, astonishingly, that she had only learned of her husband's guilt two weeks earlier. Furthermore, she said the \u00a35,000 stolen from Mrs Pennack, implied in court to have been stolen in part to pay for books, had in fact been stashed in a safe.\n\nOne wonders what Morris planned to do with all that cash.\n\nSo what is on record about him? According to his Facebook page, he studied colour chemistry and physics at Trent Polytechnic.\n\nAnd, according to his LinkedIn page, he studied theology at St John's Theological College in Bramcote, Nottingham, graduating in 2003. He then went on to do a Licentiate degree in theological studies at the same institution.\n\nIn 2004, he became vicar of St Matthew's. According to Mrs Morris's biography on the National Association of City and Town Sheriffs' website, she met the then Andy Morris in 1979, while working as a nurse. Four years later, they were married.\n\nJackie later became a licensed reader in the Anglican Church and was Lord Mayor of Nottingham from May 2015 to May 2016.\n\nIn July 2011, two years after the first arson attack, the Rev Morris showed off his fire-eating talents at the summer fair at another local church, while his wife, then a Labour councillor, dressed up as Poppy the clown.\n\nAndy the vicar was very popular with his parishioners. Among them was Joan Pennack, known to all by her middle name, Mavis, who had been a regular worshipper at St Matthew's for more than 30 years before her death in 2017. She was widowed from her husband, Alfred, a retired railway signalman she married relatively late in life in 1971, and the church was the focus of her life.\n\nHer 82-year-old stepdaughter, Sheila Smith, Alfred's daughter, who was to play a crucial role in bringing Morris to justice, says: 'I heard that Mavis won an amount on the Lottery and paid for the church to have new pews and a new lectern. She would make batches of mince pies and ran the church luncheon club for many years.'\n\nMorris, says Mrs Smith, showed great concern towards Mavis as she grew frailer and, in 2010, found her a warden-assisted flat.\n\nIn 2016, the vicar had her moved to a care home. Mavis died on January 9, 2017. It wasn't until two weeks after her death that the vicar got in touch to tell her the news.\n\n'He claimed not to know who I was and that he'd just chanced across my details among Mavis's possessions, which seemed a bit odd as I was her next of kin.\n\n'He was really nice at the funeral. He looked like Santa to me with his long white beard and jolly persona. So friendly.'\n\nBut Mrs Smith soon changed her view of Morris when she received a letter from Mrs Pennack's solicitors saying she had been named in the will \u2014 she says she received a \u00a310,000 bequest out of the will valued at up to \u00a327,000. The solicitors also sent Mrs Pennack's bank statements.\n\n'I started to go through the statements,' says Mrs Smith. 'I was an auditor so it seemed like the natural thing to do.\n\n'It was then that I saw all these cash withdrawals from December and January when she was in the care home \u2014 they were for \u00a3200 and \u00a3300.\n\n'So I asked the vicar about it and he just kept lying. He said she realised she had not left any money to her friends in her will and had asked him to withdraw it.'\n\nShe adds: 'He said he didn't know what she'd done with the money after that. We couldn't get any straight answers out of him and in the end my sister wrote to the Bishop of Southwell and this led to the police coming round.\n\n'I think my stepmother would be appalled. She trusted him, she seemed to hang on to his every word.'\n\nAn investigation began and Morris was suspended from his position last year. The Diocese confirmed he has resigned as a vicar.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife Jackie says: 'Mrs Pennack died in my husband's arms,' she says. 'She was a very sweet and adorable woman and she didn't have anyone else.\n\n'My husband is full of remorse for what he has done and feels terrible shame.'\n\nAs indeed, it seems, he should.", "description": "Rev Edward Morris was jailed for ten months after stealing \u00a35,000 from a 96-year-old parishioner who was one of his loyal flock.
