Rather than just buying tickets off that website.'\n\nOthers commented on the fact the site kept crashing once they'd finally managed to get through to the registration page.\n\n'It\u2019s a massive joke, site kept crashing, when managed to get to the page reg details in then kicked out when asking for payment. Need to sort it out,' wrote one, while another penned: 'Hands up if you put in your details and the site crashed.'\n\nA third added: 'Same thing happened to me I was literally entering bank details, how can that even be allowed!'\n\nWhile some opted to express their disappointment through a series of amusing memes, others simply penned their frustration bluntly\n\n'They should be locked as your tickets and not still be allowing incoming traffic from @seetickets to kick people out when your at the last hurdle! Absolutely soul destroying.'\n\nMeanwhile, others took the opportunity to comment on the fact the same people seem to get tickets every year and advised Glastonbury release a fairer system to give everyone an equal chance.\n\n'Ballot next year please,' suggested one. 'It doesn't seem fair that some people have been 15 years in a row whereas I have never managed to get past the holding page,' while a second agreed: 'I think they should release 10k for people who have never been!'\n\nA third infuriated customer added: 'We got through into entering registration details and then once we pressed proceed we couldn\u2019t complete the sale. Surely those tickets should be locked and allowed to go through???? Once again absolute joke of a release. UPDATE YOUR SERVERS.'\n\nA fourth asked: 'Why are 2.2 million people allowed to register when only 10% of those can possibly get tickets? Registrations should be deleted and capped at a certain amount every year. Absolute joke.'", "description": "Music lovers from across the nation took to social media to express their disappointment after missing out on Glastonbury 2020 tickets which went on sale online yesterday.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19385980-0-image-a-31_1570437109858.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
