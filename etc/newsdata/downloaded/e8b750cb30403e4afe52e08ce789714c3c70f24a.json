The children went out to defecate in the morning,\" Manoj Balmiki was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\n\"The (brothers)... shouted at them for defecating on the road and rained sticks on their heads while the children were relieving themselves, killing them in seconds.\"", "description": "Two children were beaten to death in India for defecating in the open, police said Thursday, underlining the violence sometimes unleashed to enforce Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship cleanliness drive.
