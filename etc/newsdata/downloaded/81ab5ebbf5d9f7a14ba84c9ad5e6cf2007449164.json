Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nA vocal faction led by impeachment hawks in safe districts, including Reps. Al Green of Texas, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and David Cicilline of Rhode Island, insists they already have the goods on Mr. Trump to draft articles of impeachment.\n\nIt is a more complicated political calculation for Democrats in swing districts, where they tread carefully.\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer who managed to narrowly flip her conservative Virginia district into the Democratic column in the 2018 midterms, last month helped prod Mrs. Pelosi to launch the inquiry.\n\nIn an op-ed, Ms. Spanberger and six other freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds argued the Ukraine incident crossed a line that other allegations surrounding the president simply hadn\u2019t. They urged party leadership to use every tool, including \u201cimpeachment hearings\u201d to investigate.\n\nJust a few days later, she cautioned against jumping straight to impeachment.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear on that because I think it\u2019s important that everyone understands what\u2019s at stake. Because we must fully investigate these allegations, determine if they are true or false \u2014 because if they are true, that is a grave circumstance for this country,\u201d Ms. Spanberger told The Free Lance-Star in Fredricksburg, Virginia.\n\nShe stressed that the allegation might be false.\n\n\u201cAnd if they are false, that is something we should know, we should admit, and we should discuss openly, as well. There shouldn\u2019t be this cloud hanging over this circumstance,\u201d she said.\n\nSoon after Mrs. Pelosi launched the inquiry, Congress members left for a two-week recess and had to face voters back home.\n\nOne of the more vulnerable members, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, devoted one of his marathon town halls to the impeachment inquiry issue.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have to have, are having this conversation right how is not a cause for celebration, it is moment of responsibility, it is a moment of truth, it is a moment of trying to make sure we have a shared set of facts,\u201d he told his constituents, according to the Chicago Sun Times.\n\nSeveral others lawmakers heard an earful.\n\nRepublican groups have been staging protests in competitive districts against Democrats such as Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Joe Cunningham of South Carolina.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush with impeachment? Impeachment is a serious thing,\u201d one constituent told Ms. Slotkin.\n\nEven as these vulnerable lawmakers are walking the tightrope on impeachment, they\u2019re also continuing to tout their efforts on the legislative front, reminding voters they\u2019re still trying to address kitchen table issues at the core of the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI think if we have a good strategic plan then the folks who are focused on impeachment will move out and the folks who are supposed to be focused on everything else \u2014 a transportation bill, prescription drug legislation \u2014 they will work just as hard at that legislation and pushing that forward as the folks who are focused on impeachment,\u201d Ms. Slotkin told reporters before the two-week break.\n\nMrs. Pelosi has also kept that effort up, blasting out reminders about the trade deal with Mexico and China and Democrats\u2019 new prescription drug bill even as she goes toe-to-toe with the Trump administration over the impeachment investigation process.\n\nAccording to polling data from a Trump-aligned nonprofit America First Policies, impeachment is playing poorly among swing-district voters in states such as New York, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nLawmakers are closely watching the polls, which have shown more Americans getting on the impeachment train. A recent National Public Radio survey showed a majority of voters \u2014 54% \u2014 want an impeachment inquiry but they split on impeachment and removal from office, with 49% opposed and 47% in favor.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
