There is no way back for Xhaka unless he apologises.\u2019\n\nThe midfielder stormed straight down the tunnel (Picture: Getty)\n\nHe added: \u2018The longer he leaves it, the bigger a mistake the incident will turn out to be.\n\n\u2018When supporters have a go at you like that, it is because they are not happy \u2014 but he is the team\u2019s captain.\n\n\u2018So you cannot react like that, telling the fans what to do in that language.\n\n\u2018Whatever you think of the fans, they are the ones that pay their money.\n\n\u2018They are the ones who buy season tickets and come and support you week in, week out. Like it or not, supporters are entitled to an opinion.\u2019\n\nArsenal threw away a two-goal lead against Palace (Picture: Getty)\n\nIan Wright agreed that Xhaka must apologise to Arsenal fans as he \u2018owes them a lot more\u2019 than to react as he did at the Emirates.\n\n\u2018Players getting booed is not the best, but this is the captain,\u2019 the former Arsenal forward said on Match of the Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They are frustrated that he hasn\u2019t run off the pitch. I\u2019ve seen him before bolt off when he\u2019s substituted. He\u2019s walked off and then he goads them.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re talking about fans who have watched him play a handful of good games in three years. And he\u2019s treating them like that.\n\n\u2018He should apologise. That\u2019s the guy Arsenal have chosen as captain\u2026 that\u2019s not captain behaviour.\n\n\u2018Arsenal fans have been patient with him. He owes them a lot more than that.\u2019\n\nMORE: Lucas Torreira pictured in tears as Granit Xhaka tells Arsenal fans to \u2018f**k off\u2019", "description": "Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka must apologise immediately to fans for his behaviour against Crystal Palace.
