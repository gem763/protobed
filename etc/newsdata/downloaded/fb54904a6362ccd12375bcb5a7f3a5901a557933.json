As a conservative-leaning clinical psychologist I know explained to me, when new experiences don\u2019t fit into an existing schema \u2014 Mr. Trump becoming the leader of the party that insisted on the necessity of good character in the Oval Office when Bill Clinton was president, for example \u2014 cognitive accommodation occurs.\n\nWhen the accommodation involves compromising one\u2019s sense of integrity, the tensions are reduced when others join in the effort. This creates a powerful sense of cohesion, harmony and group think. The greater the compromise, the more fierce the justification for it \u2014 and the greater the need to denounce those who call them out for their compromise. \u201cIn response,\u201d this person said to me, \u201can \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality emerges, sometimes quite viciously.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat used to be a sense of belonging,\u201d I was told, \u201cdevolves into primitive tribalism, absolute adherence to the leader over adherence to a code of ethics.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Peter Wehner", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Republicans-Trump-Impeachment.Html"], "top_image": ""}
