The filing obtained by the AP identifies almost 200 auto-generated pages \u2014 some for businesses, others for schools or other categories \u2014 that directly reference the Islamic State group and dozens more representing al-Qaida and other known groups. One page listed as a \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d is titled \u201cI love Islamic state.\u201d It features an IS logo inside the outlines of Facebook\u2019s famous thumbs-up icon.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, a Facebook spokesperson told the AP: \u201cOur priority is detecting and removing content posted by people that violates our policy against dangerous individuals and organizations to stay ahead of bad actors. Auto-generated pages are not like normal Facebook pages as people can\u2019t comment or post on them and we remove any that violate our policies. While we cannot catch every one, we remain vigilant in this effort.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
