It will be Harry\u2019s memorial. His legacy.\u201d\n\nSeiger claimed the US government had tried to \u201ctwist and contort the laws on diplomatic immunity\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Trump administration is not only hellbent on breaking international laws, rules and conventions on diplomatic immunity, but they have no care or concern for the welfare of Harry\u2019s family or any real intent on finding a solution.\u201d\n\nThe Dunn family have so far raised nearly \u00a375,000 through a GoFundMe page, but the potential legal costs facing the family are mounting.\n\nThe lawyers are also planning to take action against Northamptonshire police and have launched a claim for judicial review over the Foreign Office decision-making process.\n\nTrump tried to engineer an impromptu meeting between Dunn\u2019s parents and Sacoolas when the family were granted an extraordinary meeting with the US president in the White House a fortnight ago.\n\nThe Dunn family had been in New York to put pressure on Sacoolas to return to the UK to answer questions from Northamptonshire police.\n\nSeiger called the White House attempt to get the family and Sacoolas in the same room a \u201cdisgusting stunt\u201d, adding: \u201cPresident Trump told Harry\u2019s mum, Charlotte, at the meeting that we would look to approach the problem from a different angle, but the family have heard no further and have no faith in his words.\u201d\n\nThe Dunn family\u2019s cause has the political backing of the Labour party, which has called for a parliamentary inquiry.\n\nThe shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said: \u201cIt now looks increasingly clear that the foreign secretary and his officials have something to hide in terms of how they responded to this dreadful tragedy, why they allowed Anne Sacoolas to leave the country and why they delayed informing Harry Dunn\u2019s family of her departure.\n\n\u201cWe also have to ask what matters more to Dominic Raab: the grief of a bereaved British family or the approval or a corrupt American president?\n\n\u201cWe need an urgent parliamentary inquiry to uncover who did what in this case, who took the decisions, when they were taken, and why.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers for family say Trump administration tried to \u2018twist\u2019 immunity law for US diplomat", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9f2de6262965e6ee64e2008a835dbe75d8cdc0/0_90_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fedf888dec3b32f21fe597a2f9e6e5a5", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
