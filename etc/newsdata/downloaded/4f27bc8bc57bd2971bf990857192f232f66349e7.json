But anti-pollution measures are being deployed as a precaution.\n\n\u201cThe ship is stuck in the middle of the islands of the Natural Reserve of the Mouths of Bonifacio in a protected area that is environmentally very sensitive,\u201d the reserve\u2019s director Jean-Michel Culioli said at the scene.\n\n\u201cIt (the ship) should never have been there. We remain vigilant,\u201d he added.\n\nThe reserve, stretching over 80,000 hectares, is the largest in mainland France, a scuba divers\u2019 paradise with several small islands in the strait separating French Corsica from Italian Sardinia.\n\nMaritime police have boarded the ship, and a marine intervention team has departed from Toulon on southern France to inspect the damage.\n\nThe authorities have prohibited any ships or other nautical activities in a one-kilometre (0.6-mile) radius of the stranded ship.", "description": "Ajaccio (France) (AFP) \u2013 A 90-metre (295-foot) cargo ship ran aground Sunday in a pristine marine reserve in the Strait of Bonaficio off the French", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/9696af_rhodanus-transporting-650-tonnes-steel-coils-crew-ran-trouble-in-mouths-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
