The Communist Party of China considers it a rogue province of the \u201cmainland,\u201d its term for the legal boundaries of China, and regularly bullies other countries and international institutions to exclude Taiwan from the international community.\n\nTsai encouraged her people to embrace their national identity and values of freedom and democracy as an example to the world.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing China\u2019s rise and expansion, as they challenge free, democratic values and the global order through a combination of authoritarianism, nationalism, and economic might,\u201d Tsai said. \u201cAs the strategic forefront of the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan has become the first line of defense for democratic values.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is encroaching on us through their sharp power, but as a crucial member of the region, we know that Taiwan must fulfill its responsibilities to the international community. We will not act provocatively or rashly; rather, we will work with like-minded countries to ensure that the peaceful and stable cross-strait status quo is not unilaterally altered,\u201d she added.\n\nTsai, up for reelection this year, also hinted at the political divide in the country naturally caused by elections, urging Taiwanese people to resist divisions that could negatively alter national values.\n\n\u201c[W]e cannot be divided amongst ourselves, regardless of party affiliation. No one has a patent on the Republic of China, and no one can monopolize Taiwan,\u201d Tsai affirmed. \u201cThe words \u2018Republic of China (Taiwan)\u2019 are not the exclusive property of any one political party, and that is the overwhelming consensus of Taiwan society.\u201d\n\nTsai responded with a resounding rejection to Chinese Communist Party dictator Xi Jinping\u2019s call last week for Beijing to annex Taiwan under the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d policy that has plummetted Hong Kong toward severe police repression of free speech:\n\nThe U.S.-China trade dispute continues. And not far from Taiwan, Hong Kong is on the verge of chaos due to the failure of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d Nevertheless, China is still threatening to impose its \u201cone country, two systems model for Taiwan.\u201d Their diplomatic offensives and military coercion pose a serious challenge to regional stability and peace. My fellow citizens, when freedom and democracy are challenged, and when the Republic of China\u2019s existence and development are threatened, we must stand up and defend ourselves. The overwhelming consensus among Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people is our rejection of \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d regardless of party affiliation or political position. The Republic of China has stood tall on Taiwan for over 70 years. But if we were to accept \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d there would no longer be room for the Republic of China\u2019s existence. As President, standing up to protect national sovereignty is not a provocation \u2014 it is my fundamental responsibility.\n\nXi spoke last week on the dire occasion of the 70th anniversary of communist repression of China and declared that his regime seeks \u201cthe complete reunification of the motherland,\u201d including all ethnic Han Chinese people.\n\n\u201cWe must uphold the principles of \u2018Peaceful Reunification\u2019 and \u2018One Country, Two Systems,\u2019 maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, unite all Chinese sons and daughters, and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said.\n\nXi added that the annexation of Taiwan was \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nAmerican Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was present in Taipei Thursday for National Day festivities, the first senator present in 35 years, according to Taipei\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cWe also will stand up against Chinese efforts to undermine Taiwan,\u201d Cruz told reporters, according to the Taipei Times. \u201cThis is a friendship that is incredibly important. This is a military relationship that is incredibly important. This is an economic relationship that is incredibly important.\u201d\n\nWhat a delight to have Senator @tedcruz visiting #Taiwan for our National Day. Senator, your support for freedom & democracy around the world including #HongKong is admired; your all-out support for Taiwan, a front-line state, is greatly appreciated by the people here.

The Taiwanese flag also flew in Hong Kong, where the pro-democracy protest movement took a moment to observe the holiday and salute the Republic of China. Some protesters also urged Taiwan not to vote for the opposition Kuomintang (Naitonalist Party), as it maintains friendly relations with the communists.\n\nSome have called on Hongkongers not to overuse ROC symbols given the Kuomintang\u2019s authoritarian history in Taiwan and conciliatory cross-straits policy. \u201cIf you vote for the KMT, Taiwan will turn into Hong Kong,\u201d shouts a protester at Sun Yat-sen Park.

This has resulted in the world losing millions in donations for human rights, technology, and public health projects that Taipei has attempted to donate, as well as the expertise of Taiwan\u2019s professionals.\n\nAt the United Nations General Assembly last month, Taiwan\u2019s allies \u2013 Guatemala, eSwatini, and Palau \u2013 condemned the organization for excluding the country from participation.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen asserted that her nation is \"the first line of defense for democratic values.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/Taiwan-President-Tsai-Ing-wen-flag-Getty-Image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
