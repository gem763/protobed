Clark, who had previous stops at SAP SE ADR SAP, +1.28% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.21%, is being succeeded by Bharat Mediratta (CTO) and Tim Young (senior vice president and general manager). Dropbox disclosed the move to MarketWatch before posting a blog item.\n\n\u201cIt was not so much a decision to leave as to start my venture career,\u201d Clark, 48, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. Clark, who is leaving Dropbox in January, declined to name the VC firm he is joining.\n\nMediratta was an engineer for more than a decade at Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +0.98% GOOG, +0.95% Google, one of the two primary rivals of Dropbox for corporate workplace customers. Microsoft is the other.\n\nYoung previously was vice president of product and engineering at VMware Inc. VMW, +0.60%.\n\nClark deemed the change a \u201cfundamental restructuring\u201d of the CTO office, which has grown in responsibility, duties and pressure the past few years as companies collect, share and secure data on cloud-computing platforms.\n\nThe executive reshuffling is part of a larger strategic shift at Dropbox. The company went public last year amid great promise only to see its stock tumble 27% the past year. Dropbox shares declined 3.5% to $19.26 in trading on Wednesday, edging toward a 52-week low.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has revamped its product line to pursue large enterprise customers in a bid to bolster revenue growth, which hasn\u2019t satisfied investors. Its hope is that more of its 600 million registered customers pay for upgraded services rather than stick with a free but more bare-bones service.\n\nLast week, Dropbox said it had made changes to its core product, Dropbox Spaces, so that various work folders are interlinked, and a new desktop app that functions as a digital hub where workers can collaborate with colleagues on projects that require access to digital files.\n\nRead more: Dropbox overhauls product line, welcomes Michelle Obama\n\nDropbox Chief Executive Drew Houston said in a press conference last week it was too early to share user adoption numbers for Dropbox\u2019s new software lineup because it began rolling it out in June.", "description": "In the latest change at the document-sharing unicorn, Dropbox on Wednesday said CTO Quentin Clark is leaving after two years.
