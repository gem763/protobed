Or maybe you did something that looked hard, but you decided to try it. That is courage in action and you probably felt very good about what you did. And you should!\n\nCourage shows up in many ways all around you. Courage is standing up for a friend, helping someone in need or sticking with something that is hard for you to do. They say that having courage makes you a better person, and courage is one of the most important faculties you can develop.\n\nBut what if being brave and courageous was the only choice you had to make?\n\nAs a parent of two boys with Jansen\u2019s metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, an ultra-rare skeletal disease that affects less than 30 people worldwide, I am pained to see courage every day. \u201cPained\u201d you ask? Yes. Pained. Gutted. Destroyed. Every time I hear myself or someone else tell my boys, \u201cBe brave!\u201d or \u201cBe strong!\u201d I die a thousand times inside.\n\nRelated:\u200b Why We Decided to Start the First Rare Disease Film Festival\n\nI have always dealt with pain with a sense of surreal stoicism. It has served me well during numerous surgeries and agonizing recoveries. In the face of open laughter, stares and gawks, I have developed a coat of stoic armor that allows me to focus on only sunshine and lollipops, kind people and puppy dogs.\n\nSo when I was confronted by my plucky 9-year-old who screamed, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be brave!\u201d as he writhed in a hospital bed, amidst a cacophony of beeping wires and tormenting arms holding him down, my world of valor and fortitude, so painfully built, came crushing down.\n\nAnd after bloody sheets were changed, wires re-plugged, tears wiped and the last unfortunate nurse crept out of our room squeezing my arm with the last vestige of kindness, I sunk into the armchair watching my little boy\u2019s body heave and whimper in fitful sleep.\n\nView photos Two children hugging each other.

In sheer exhaustion from repeated surgical procedures, pokes, popped veins, failed IV attempts, courage retreats behind sunken eyes wrung of every tear, pile-high unwashed laundry and lingered menacingly in the rank smell of stale vomit.\n\nThe next morning, my heart sunk even further. As I carefully cleaned up trails of dried blood from wounds on my little boy and glanced furtively over the sprawling crimson bruises from arms that were meant \u201cto make things better,\u201d his eyes reached for me. Ever so softly, between parched lips, he spoke: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I could not be brave.\u201d\n\nI froze. There were lots of quotes about overcoming fear and being brave floating through my mind, but I couldn\u2019t find one that would take my baby boy\u2019s pain away. Not one that could make sense of the pain he felt. Not one that promised him that tomorrow would be better.\n\nRelated:\u200b What Not to Do When You See a Sick Person in Public\n\nFor the record, I have no problem with clich\u00e9s or platitudes \u2014 they exist because there is usually some truth to them. But they were not needed here. Not at this moment. The most profound thing I have learned about rare diseases is the fear is real. There is no escaping it. It is an enemy he will battle till the end.\n\nCourage is a highly-prized virtue, and many famous and respected people have spoken or written about it over the years. We probably all have an idea of what we mean by courage, or bravery as it is sometimes known. From the religious teachings to fairy tales; ancient myths to Hollywood movies, our culture is rich with exemplary tales of bravery for the greater good. From the cowardly lion in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d who finds the courage to face the witch, to David battling Goliath in the Bible, to \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d children are raised on a diet of heroic and inspirational tales. But when we ask little kids to fight battles that are grossly unfair, to wrestle with emotions too big to comprehend and to wage war against systems that keep 7,000 rare diseases searching for cures, \u201cBe brave,\u201d sounds trite \u2014 a hazy castle in a fading photograph that time forgot.
