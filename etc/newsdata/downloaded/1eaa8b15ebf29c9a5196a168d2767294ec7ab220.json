The American people have a right to know if, as second in line to the presidency, he facilitated his family\u2019s enrichment. Did he do so consciously or through blind irresponsibility? He flew Hunter Biden to China on an official visit: What did Joe think Hunter was doing on that trip? If nothing is amiss, follow the administration\u2019s response to this scandal and open the books. Until that happens, an investigation \u2014 whether formal or informal \u2014 is justified.\n\nSecond, my distinction: Information is not interference. Based on the call transcript, Trump asked Zelensky to get to the bottom of whether Ukraine or Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 election. One may consider Trump\u2019s concerns absurd or silly. Alternatively, one may suspect Ukrainian involvement. I do not know and will not pretend to know, because whether Ukraine was actually involved is irrelevant. The request for information that the Ukrainian president may be uniquely positioned to offer is fair and does not, in and of itself, constitute election interference.\n\nThe president is well within his rights to seek information from his counterparts abroad. He can ask Zelensky if the Dodgers will make the World Series, or who Zelensky thinks is the most formidable Democratic candidate. Soliciting information, in the form of facts or opinion, does not constitute election interference. It does not constitute having a foreign head of state do opposition research for the Trump campaign. It is not some of in-kind contribution.\n\nNor is there anything wrong with the president using leverage to get answers to his questions.", "description": "", "authors": ["Luke Thompson", "Nationalreview.Com Why-Trump-Did-Nothing-Wrong-In-His-Phone-Call-With-Zelensky", "Utm_Content Utm_Medium Social"], "top_image": ""}
