Business leaders have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy and his response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. On guns, the president has on several occasions offered support for stronger firearms policies before stepping away.\n\nSome of the letter signers plan to lobby lawmakers in Washington, but it is unclear how much money, if any, the companies may devote to this issue.\n\nSome executives signed on without hesitation. Others mulled it, often creating a raucous debate inside their offices and among their boards of directors, only to decide that the political risk was too high. More than a half-dozen executives spoke about their deliberations on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of conversations.\n\nMark Zuckerberg of Facebook did not sign, although he told colleagues and peers that he agreed with stricter background checks, two people involved in the conversation said . With Facebook under federal scrutiny \u2014 and contending with a drumbeat of criticism from Republicans who contend that the company\u2019s platform silences conservative voices \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg has decided that activism on this issue would only intensify the spotlight on the company, these people said. Others inside Facebook made the case that it was a moral responsibility to press for more responsible gun sales laws.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised by the leadership at Google, whose YouTube unit was the site of a shooting last year. Google recently announced an internal policy that would make it hard for the company to consider signing the letter. That policy includes this line: \u201cOur primary responsibility is to do the work we\u2019ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.\u201d\n\nUber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, signed. His company\u2019s policy bans guns from its vehicles, either for drivers or passengers. Lyft, Uber\u2019s main rival, signed as well.", "description": "\u201cDoing nothing about America\u2019s gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable,\u201d the corporate chiefs urged senators in a letter.", "authors": ["Andrew Ross Sorkin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/business/12DB-SORKIN-01/12DB-SORKIN-01-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
