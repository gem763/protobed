Others mulled it, often creating a raucous debate inside their offices and among their boards of directors, only to decide that the political risk was too high. More than a half-dozen executives spoke about their deliberations on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of conversations.\n\nMark Zuckerberg of Facebook did not sign, although he told colleagues and peers that he agreed with stricter background checks, two people involved in the conversation said . With Facebook under federal scrutiny \u2014 and contending with a drumbeat of criticism from Republicans who contend that the company\u2019s platform silences conservative voices \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg has decided that activism on this issue would only intensify the spotlight on the company, these people said. Others inside Facebook made the case that it was a moral responsibility to press for more responsible gun sales laws.\n\nSimilar concerns were raised by the leadership at Google, whose YouTube unit was the site of a shooting last year. Google recently announced an internal policy that would make it hard for the company to consider signing the letter. That policy includes this line: \u201cOur primary responsibility is to do the work we\u2019ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.\u201d\n\nUber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, signed. His company\u2019s policy bans guns from its vehicles, either for drivers or passengers. Once he signed, Lyft, Uber\u2019s main rival, signed as well.\n\nSeveral executives said one of the biggest practical worries was whether taking such a stance would lead to in-store confrontations with angry customers carrying guns. Would they be putting their employees in danger or even just in an uncomfortable discussion about a divisive issue?\n\nEven banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, which both publicly distanced themselves from gunmakers this year by ending lending and banking relationships with manufacturers, declined to sign the letter. After they made their positions public this year, the banks were rebuked by Republican lawmakers. Louisiana passed a law preventing the banks from working on bond offerings for the state.\n\n\u201cI personally believe the policies of these banks are an infringement on the rights of Louisiana citizens,\u201d the state\u2019s treasurer, John Schroder, said at the time. \u201cNo one can convince me that keeping these two banks in this competitive process is worth giving up our rights.\u201d", "description": "\u201cDoing nothing about America\u2019s gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable,\u201d the heads of 145 companies wrote to senators.", "authors": ["Andrew Ross Sorkin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/business/12DB-SORKIN-01/12DB-SORKIN-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
