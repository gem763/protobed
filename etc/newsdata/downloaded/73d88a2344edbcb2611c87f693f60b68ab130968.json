Circuit judge has rejected President Trump\u2019s appeal of a judge\u2019s ruling that the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office can legally subpoena for the president\u2019s tax returns, officials said.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Friday ordered Mazars USA, an accounting firm used by Trump and the Trump Organization, to hand over the eight-years\u2019 worth of tax returns pertaining to both parties.\n\nAt the end of August, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. subpoenaed Mazars USA, arguing that they were part of \"an ongoing state criminal prosecution,\" according to court papers.\n\nThen, on Sept. 19, Trump sued Vance, a Democrat, and the accounting firm, calling the subpoena \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\n\"Because the Mazars subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting president, it is unconstitutional,\" court papers argued. \"This court should declare it invalid and enjoin its enforcement until the president is no longer in office.\"\n\nBut a federal court judge on Monday denounced Trump\u2019s claims, writing:\n\n\"As the Court reads it, presidential immunity would stretch to cover every phase of criminal proceedings, including investigations, grand jury proceedings and subpoenas, indictment, prosecution, arrest, trial, conviction, and incarceration,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in his Oct. 7 ruling. \u201cThat constitutional protection presumably would encompass any conduct, at any time, in any forum, whether federal or state, and whether the President acted alone or in concert with other individuals.\"\n\nThe president\u2019s attorneys immediately appealed.\n\nOn Friday, D.C. Circuit Judges David Tatel and Patricia Millett, who were both appointed by Democratic presidents, ruled that \u201cMazars must comply.\u201d\n\nTrump appointee Neomi Rao wrote in dissent that the committee should have asked for the records under the House's impeachment power, not its legislative authority.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team is now \u201creviewing options.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we are reviewing the court\u2019s lengthy decision, as well as Judge Rao\u2019s dissent,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, \u201cwe continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative authority.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News\u2019 Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts contributed to this story.", "description": "The U.S. Court of Appeals has ordered an accounting firm used by President Trump and the Trump Organization to hand over the tax eight-years\u2019 worth of tax returns.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/trump-gavel-iStock-001-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
