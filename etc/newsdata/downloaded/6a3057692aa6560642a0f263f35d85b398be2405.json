Or, at least, it would be\u2026 eventually.\n\nProducer John Lloyd had assembled a team of comedians around the still relatively unknown Rowan Atkinson for a topical sketch show to be called Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News \u2013 because it was scheduled on BBC2 against the main BBC1 evening news bulletin.\n\nThe first programme was due to have been aired on 2 April 1979, in the timeslot vacated by what was supposed to have been the last ever episode of Fawlty Towers \u2013 except that Basil Fawlty\u2019s swansong was delayed because of a technicians\u2019 strike. John Cleese even filmed a special sketch in which Basil explained the absence of Fawlty Towers that week and that a \u201ctatty revue\u201d would be broadcast instead. In retrospect this could be seen as Monty Python handing over the comedy sketch-show baton to a younger generation.

In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she\u2019s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she\u2019s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania. Standout line: \u201cI have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility, it's humiliation.

Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she\u2019s not sorry?) are gold. Standout line: \u201cNow, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he\u2019s going to leave me out of intimidation.

Under the pretence of pondering whether she\u2019s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences \u2013 including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood \u2013 and riffs on the absurdities of daily life.

During her premiership, TV satire, dormant since the early Sixties and the era of Beyond the Fringe and That Was the Week That Was, rose again with a vengeance. Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News was the neonatal ward of that rebirth.\n\nThe show, which aired on 16 October 1979, wasn\u2019t initially well received by critics or viewers, although re-watching the very first episode on YouTube it\u2019s hard to see why not \u2013 bookended as it is by two classic sketches: the inspired spoof on televised darts in which the players Fatbelly and Evenfatterbelly (Smith and Jones) swig alcoholic drinks instead of throwing darts, and Atkinson in a monkey suit as Gerald the talking gorilla. \u201cWhen I caught Gerald in \u201968 he was completely wild\u201d, Smith told Pamela Stephenson\u2019s TV presenter. \u201cWild?\u2019 retorted the gorilla peevishly. \u201cI was absolutely livid!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a skit on Question Time, and while today\u2019s under-50s might never have heard of Labour MP Frances Morrell or trade unionist Clive Jenkins, they will be familiar with the format of the programme. In the meantime, the political guests\u2019 evasiveness would seem to be perennial.\n\nStephenson feels under-used in this first episode, but is still a long way from Monty Python\u2019s token female \u201ctotty\u201d, Carol Cleveland, and Stephenson would become more central, especially when her gift for mimicry was discovered (her Janet Street-Porter is especially clever). Nevertheless, the opening show was fairly representative of what was to come \u2013 a mix of parodic pop songs, mischievously redeployed news footage and quickfire sketches.\n\nBut it was Mrs Thatcher and her hugely divisive administration that was the gift that kept on giving to satirists, and John Lloyd, whose first TV production job this was, would go on to help create the defining lampoon of the era, Spitting Image. Some of the stuff that Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News was satirising inevitably now looks dated (tortured trade union negotiations, anyone, or Britt Ekland\u2019s love life?) or even redactable (Cyril Smith and Jimmy Savile as innocent figures of fun), but a lot of it still remains relevant, from pornographic pop videos and the dearth of hospital beds to one skit in which Atkinson plays a hardline MP addressing the Tory party conference on immigration and crime \u2013 even if, unlike her fictional counterpart, Priti Patel wouldn\u2019t use the \u201cn word\u201d.\n\nJust 16 days after the Thatcher election victory that was to inspire a new satire boom, something else was brewing in incongruous surroundings above a Soho strip club. The first London Comedy Store was hosting nights featuring what would later come to be known as \u201calternative comedy\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s to say, hostile to the traditional rote of sexist and racist gags that came to be personified in Bernard Manning, but which back then was the depressing norm.\n\nAlternative comedy would truly come of age three years later with the intersecting casts of The Young Ones and The Comic Strip, but it was Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News that paved the way, with its bold refusal to indulge in lazy sexist and racist stereotypes or rely on Two Ronnies-style innuendo and overscripted sketches. In fact, the brevity of many of the skits often exceeded those of its near-direct descendent, The Fast Show.\n\nOf course, none of this would have mattered if the performers and writers hadn\u2019t been funny. Among the latter were Clive Anderson, Andy Hamilton and Rowan Atkinson\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator, a certain Richard Curtis, who would go to work with Atkinson on Blackadder and Mr Bean before becoming the nation\u2019s foremost purveyor of romcoms.\n\nBlackadder would showcase Atkinson\u2019s verbal dexterity, but Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News introduced his rubbery facial expressions, matched if not exceeded by Mel Smith\u2019s wonderfully mobile features \u2013 a countenance that one obituarist described after Smith\u2019s untimely death in 2013 as \u201cmugging with a deadpan virtuosity rarely seen since Oliver Hardy in his pomp\u201d.\n\nThe knockabout physical side of their performances complemented the show\u2019s more sharp-edged political and satirical content. Atkinson\u2019s gift for lugubrious mime would reach its apotheosis in Mr Bean, while Mel Smith\u2019s face in close-up profile \u2013 in his head-to-head chats with Griff Rhys Jones \u2013 would become the most cherished part of their hugely successful Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News spinoff, Alas Smith and Jones.\n\nSmith and Jones\u2019s greatest legacy, however, turned out to be off-screen. In 1981, while still working on Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News, they created their own production company, Talkback Productions, initially to make humorous training videos in the style of John Cleese\u2019s Video Arts. Talkback, however, was to produce some of the most influential British comedy of the last 40 years, including The Day Today, Da Ali G Show, Smack the Pony, Green Wing, Brass Eye, I\u2019m Alan Partridge, The Armando Iannucci Shows, Big Train and Meet Ricky Gervais (just to name a few). Oh, yes, and The Apprentice \u2013 that\u2019s one of theirs, Lord Sugar no doubt heartily approving when Smith and Jones sold the company in 2000 for \u00a362m.\n\nAs for Pamela Stephenson, she had tired of comedy by the mid-Eighties, married Billy Connolly and trained as a psychologist with a successful practice in Beverley Hills. Her unhappy experience working as the only woman on a live version of The Comic Strip (\u201cDoing stand-up was like a war with everyone playing this game of \u2018I can be funnier than you\u2019\u201d) reflects a still ongoing complaint of female comedians booked on to highly competitive, male-dominated TV panel shows.\n\nThese days there is no shortage of satirical news programmes, from Mock the Week to Have I Got News for You to The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle\u2019s New World Order. But back in 1979, Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News was little short of revolutionary \u2013 or, as contemporary newspaper critics would have it, \u201cextremely offensive\u201d and \u201cshould not be allowed on TV\u201d. In the age of Johnson, Corbyn, Trump and Putin, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that Spitting Image is to be revived after 23 years. Without Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News, we may have never seen it in the first place.", "description": "The late spring of 1979 was not just a watershed moment in British politics, ushering in a decade of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s nation-reconfiguring Conservative government, but also a pivotal moment for British comedy.
