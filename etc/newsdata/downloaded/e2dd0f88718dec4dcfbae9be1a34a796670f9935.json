The original plan was to have the location changed not just every year \u2013 but every week.\n\nIn series one, the amateur bakers travelled around the country each week, changing location per episode. So they filmed cakes in the Cotswolds, biscuits in Scotland, bread in Sandwich, puddings in Bakewell and pastry in Cornwall. However, the final Bake Off was filmed in Fulham Palace, London.\n\nA logistical nightmare of grand proportions, the idea to move the show around each week was unsurprisingly scrapped after series one, and in series two Bake Off was based at Valentines Mansion in Redbridge, near London.\n\nShow producers then swapped the Mansion for a beautiful Georgian country house for both series three and four. Harptree Court in Somerset became the show\u2019s new home for these two series before GBBO changed locations one final time and set up shop in Welford Park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019ve clearly found the ideal filming location for the show, because Great British Bake Off has been filmed there ever since and didn\u2019t change location when the show moved from the BBC to Channel 4.\n\nMORE: 21 secrets from behind the scenes of The Great British Bake Off\n\nMORE: Great British Bake Off 2019 contestant Henry started watching the show when he was 12 and we feel ancient", "description": "The action on Great British Bake Off takes place inside the famous baking tent but it wouldn\u2019t be GBBO without beautiful filming locations.", "authors": ["Rachael Martin"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_80797504_1571156433.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
