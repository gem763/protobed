But there was one that I profoundly disagreed with: \u201cIt\u2019s on: the Brexit election\u201d.\n\nI disagreed for two reasons. First, this general election will not resolve Brexit, however Boris Johnson tries to frame it. A clear decision on Brexit requires a clear and specific question to voters in the form of a people\u2019s vote or confirmatory ballot. A general election \u2013 with its myriad issues \u2013 will not deliver this especially given that, under our archaic and undemocratic electoral system, majority governments are regularly elected on a minority of votes.\n\nFor three and a half years now, Johnson has been manipulating the Brexit issue for his own political advantage, starting from the moment he decided to back the Leave campaign because he thought it would deliver him the keys to Number 10. Sadly, it eventually did.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHe is now weaponising Brexit to try to win a majority. He\u2019s abandoned his Withdrawal Bill \u2013 despite it winning a majority in the commons \u2013 and is targeting Leave-voting areas with his poisonous narrative of \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d. If we allow him to frame this as a Brexit election, we are falling into his trap.\n\nOpposition parties had been quite shrewd in spotting these traps and shutting them down. His attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit by proroguing Parliament was foiled; his planned crash-out on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d was averted; his cynical push for an early election was resisted \u2013 until now.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It\u2019s a deeply disappointing response after months of principled resistance to one of the most right-wing prime ministers in recent history.\n\nIf his gamble pays off \u2013 and it is a huge gamble \u2013 we face years of lies, the scrapping of regulations protecting workers\u2019 rights and the environment, the sacrifice of our NHS to US drug companies in the pursuit of a trade deal with Trump\u2019s America, and the very real prospect of a no-deal Brexit at some time in the future.\n\nThe second reason I reject the notion of a Brexit election is that this is not the most important issue facing our country \u2013 despite the column inches and airtime devoted to it.\n\nWe are facing a climate emergency with very little time to respond to it. The government\u2019s own advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, warned us back in July that the next 18 months would be critical in determining whether we are serious about averting climate catastrophe.\n\nOver the past year, the government has delivered just one of 25 critical policies needed to meet emissions reduction targets. Climate action to prepare homes, businesses and our natural environment for climate change is going backwards.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson says he wants to \u201cget Brexit done to regulate differently\u201d \u2013 and his first step is to drop environmental protections from his Withdrawal Bill \u2013 it sends a clear message about his commitment to climate action. He isn\u2019t interested.\n\nHis record on climate speaks for itself. His leadership campaign was part-funded by a director of the Global Warming Policy Forum, an anti-climate action lobby group. He dodged the Heathrow expansion, skipping a key vote despite previously saying he opposed a third runway (so add cowardice to the charge sheet). He\u2019s been a member of a government which has slashed support for renewable energy, subsidised fossil fuels and backed fracking.\n\nMost of the time, though, he simply ignores the issue and his ministers follow suit. September\u2019s spending round had nothing in it which addressed the scale of the emergency. No detail on decarbonisation, nothing on renewable energy, nothing to promote a programme of building millions of zero-carbon homes.\n\nA survey today from ClientEarth shows that climate change would influence the way more than half of adults will vote in the general election, and nearly two-thirds of them want a Green New Deal.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the Brexit election, it\u2019s the climate election. Boris Johnson has shown he can\u2019t be trusted to tell the truth, obey the law, or even deliver on his own promises. He certainly can\u2019t be trusted to set us on a path away from climate catastrophe.\n\nThis is a decisive moment for our country. How people vote will determine our future not just for the next five years but for generations. It feels like the moment to vote Green.", "description": "The headlines on Wednesday were all depressingly predictable: Grinches stealing Christmas, turkeys being stuffed or voting for Christmas.
