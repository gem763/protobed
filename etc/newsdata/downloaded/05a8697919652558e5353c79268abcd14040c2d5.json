The best thing to do before any kind of investment is to educate yourself before you make any hasty decisions. Being extra cautious could be an excellent idea.\n\nWhen it comes to the stock market though, \u201cplaying it safe\u201d doesn\u2019t always pay off and putting your money on a seemingly \u2018sure bet\u2019 that most big players are investing in, might not get you the results you are actually looking for.\n\nWhen you take a deeper look, you\u2019ll notice that there are actually incredible opportunities in \u201csmaller\u201d and less heard biotech stocks that can bring you closer to the sweet payday.\n\nUsing TipRanks\u2019 Stock Screener, we\u2019ve highlighted 3 ultra-promising biotech stocks that are showing upsides of nearly 300% and above.\n\nGamida Cell (GMDA)\n\nGamida Cell is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is creating and developing cell therapies for different types of cancers. The company has its own proprietary nicotinamide-based (or NAM based) cell expansion technology which is pretty much its \u201ctrade secret.\" NAM-based cell expansion takes the natural state of cancer cells and modifies them so that they are no longer harmful to the body.\n\nGamida is hoping to bank on the success of its frontrunner drug \u2018omidubicel\u2019 which is expected to be a life-saving stem cell transplant solution for patients with high-risk blood cancers and bone marrow failure disorders. Omidubicel is currently in Phase 3 of its clinical trials.\n\n4-star JMP analyst Jason N. Bulter sees the Phase 3 results for omidubicel in 1H20 \u201cas the primary value driver for the stock\u201d and identifies \u201cpotential for success based on positive Phase 2 results.\u201d And that\u2019s good enough reason for Bulter to rate the stock an Outperform along with $16 price target. If the price target is reached within 12 months, that would provide a 12-month return of nearly 261%.\n\n\"Our..price target is derived through an NPV analysis of omidubicel sales, for which we project U.S. sales of ~$580MM by 2027 and assign a 75% probability of approval.\u201d the analyst explained.\n\nOverall, we can see from TipRanks that Gamida has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating. In the last three months, the stock has received 22 buy ratings and seven hold ratings. Based on these ratings, the average $175 price target on X stock translates into upside of over 10% from the current share price.\n\nGamida stock has a resounding \u201cyes\u201d on Wall Street. TipRanks analytics show that out of three analysts polled in the past 3 months, all three are bullish. The price target of $17.67 shows a potential upside of about nearly 300% from where the stock is currently trading. (See Gamida stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nNabriva Therapeutics (NBRV)\n\nSimilarly to GMDA, Nabriva Therapeutics is a company that also has 2 premiere projects in the works and has a lot of promising developments going on. Nabriva's lead drug XENLETA, which treats patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), recently won FDA approval and is being distributed in the U.S. since August. Nabriva also recently acquired Zvante Therapeutics and added CONTEPO to its portfolio; an injection for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. In contrast to XENLETA, however, CONTEPO has yet to gain FDA approval.\n\nStory continues", "description": "In any industry, there are always deals that are too good to be true and unfortunately, they usually are.
