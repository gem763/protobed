Her grandfather immigrated to the United States from Lithuania in 1925 \u2014 he was the only member of his family to survive the Holocaust.\n\n\"None of this is abstract to me or my family, and I also think it shouldn't be seen in isolation,\" Menzer said. \"They (white supremacists) don't just hate Jews \u2014 they hate Muslims, they hate African Americans, they have strong anti-immigrant rhetoric. Those things are tied together in their manifestos. It is a matter for all good people to speak up against this hatred, now.\"\n\nMenzer said for her and others on campus, the graffiti is not something that can be brushed off as a joke.\n\nMenzer said she does not feel that Furman is unique or more dangerous than other campuses because of the incident, but that the graffiti is a reflection of the rise in white supremacy worldwide.\n\n\"It is more important than ever before for a group of people to speak up and to name hate when they see it and to denounce it,\" Menzer said. \"All of us who have a voice need to send a clear message \u2014 this is hate, and we denounce it,\" Menzer said.\n\nFollow Ariel Gilreath on Twitter: @arielgilreath\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/10/17/swastikas-explicit-graffiti-discovered-furman-university-dorm/4011572002/", "description": "The graffiti was discovered Tuesday on whiteboards hanging on doors in one dormitory at the South Carolina university.", "authors": ["Ariel Gilreath", "Published P.M.
