I used to pick up the ingredients on the way home and cook it that night.\u2019\n\nWith the earth creating catastrophic amounts of waste, Miguel also noted that it\u2019s imperative we\u2019re more mindful of how much we throw away, starting with food.\n\n\u2018If you throw away half a packet of something then it technically cost you double. That\u2019s how I think about it. For example, it\u2019s all very nice to pick up a huge pack of peppers for a cheaper price but the price per pepper is actually really expensive if you end up throwing half of them away.\u2019\n\n\n\nBut of course, it\u2019s not always possible to eat everything that\u2019s slightly gone off.\n\nMiguel explained that it\u2019s about using your initiative.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m confident in the kitchen so primarily I use my senses: What does it look like? What does it smell like? There are more dangerous items like chicken that you shouldn\u2019t take any risks with, but with other items such as vegetables it\u2019s pretty easy to tell.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve got recipes below if you fancy trying your own hand at making the stuff.\n\nChicken korma recipe Serves 4 Chicken korma (Picture: Elmlea) Ingredients 20g butter\n\n1tbsp vegetable oil\n\n1 onion, finely sliced\n\n3cm thumb sized piece ginger, finely grated\n\n3 large garlic cloves, finely crushed\n\n8 cardamom pods, seeds crushed\n\n1tbsp mild curry powder\n\n1tsp ground turmeric\n\n4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 3cm chunks\n\n1 chicken stock cube, dissolved in 300ml boiling water\n\n3tbsp ground almond\n\n300g Jasmine rice, to serve\n\n100ml Elmlea double\n\nPinch caster sugar\n\nHandful fresh coriander, roughly chopped Method Heat the butter and oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, add the onion and fry for 10mins until starting to soften.

While the curry sauce is cooking, prepare the basmati rice by adding 1/2 mug of rice to 1mug of water, a pinch of salt and a pinch of turmeric to a saucepan and boiling with the lid on for about 10 minutes until all the water has been absorbed.
