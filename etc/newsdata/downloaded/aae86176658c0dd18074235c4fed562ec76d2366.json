His wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, was initially supposed to introduce him but did not appear on stage.\n\nTrudeau delivered the speech without incident and shook hands with numerous supporters lining the stage and in the crowd as he left the venue.\n\nWhen asked for more details, the Liberal Party said there would be no comment on Saturday night.\n\nHeightened fears of violence\n\nSaturday's extra security measures came amid heightened fears of violence on the campaign. Last month, sources told CBC News the RCMP were compiling daily threat reports on online hate targeting federal political leaders during the election campaign, fearing it could spill over into real-world violence.\n\nGovernment sources close to the file confirmed an increase in online posts condoning violence during the campaign.\n\nIn February, ahead of his testimony in front of the justice committee on the SNC-Lavalin affair, Michael Wernick, then-clerk of the Privy Council, warned of the dangers of rising hate on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I worry about the rising tides of incitements to violence when people use terms like 'treason' and 'traitor' in open discourse. Those are the words that lead to assassination,\" Wernick told committee members.\n\nAfter his speech, Trudeau greeted supporters lining the stage while flanked by security.
