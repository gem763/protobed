If both teams are tied after a Super Over in a final or semifinal, it shall be repeated until there is a winner.\n\n\"Following on from a recommendation from the ICC Cricket Committee, the Chief Executives' Committee agreed that use of the Super Over as a way to decide results at ICC events will be retained. Both the Cricket Committee and CEC agreed it was an exciting and engaging conclusion to the game and will remain in place covering all games at both ODI and T20I World Cups,\" the ICC said\n\n\"In group stages, if the Super Over is tied the match will be tied.

England can count themselves a tad lucky at the end of the day.\n\nWith Inputs From PTI.", "description": "The ICC tweaked the super over rule for all major events after the outrage surrounding the drama at the end of the World Cup final.
