Senior analyst David Low said it would act as a \"catalyst\" for the further alignment of equity across the Darwin LNG project and its existing and new gas supply sources.\n\nSouth Korea's SK E &S, the third partner in Barossa alongside Santos and Conoco, has already signed an agreement to buy a 25 per cent stake in Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG.\n\nGiant LNG importer JERA, which owns 6.1 per cent of Darwin LNG and Bayu-Undan, is also expected to buy into Barossa to align its interests across the ventures.\n\nShares in Santos meanwhile retreated as much as 3.1 per cent on Tuesday after Monday's 5.7 per cent jump as analysts pondered the value of the deal for Santos, given several uncertainties which will play into the equation.\n\nThese include the terms on which gas from the Barossa field are processed at the Darwin LNG plant and the final costs for abandonment of the Bayu-Undan field, for which Conoco is said to have guided $US600 million. Also still up in the air is the final cost of developing the Barossa field, the price reviews under way for existing long-term sales contracts for Darwin LNG and the new contracts that are required to underpin the additional 10 years of the LNG plant operation using the new gas supply source.", "description": "A realignment of LNG interests is expected to sweep across the sector, starting with Santos' deal with ConocoPhillips.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_126/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c67465931082dc03638a2b85e53f2b686fba8681", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
