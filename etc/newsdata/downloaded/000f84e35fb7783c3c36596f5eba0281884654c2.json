REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nTrump has asked the court to block Deutsche Bank from releasing banking records related to himself and his family, which the House Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee subpoenaed in April.\n\nThe subpoena is part of Democrats\u2019 broader efforts to gather information about the Republican president\u2019s finances.\n\nLong a principal lender for Trump\u2019s real estate business, a 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million in liabilities to Deutsche Bank.\n\nIn a letter to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August, the bank acknowledged that records related to Trump and three of his children subpoenaed by the committees included tax returns.\n\nBut while the previously redacted letter said Deutsche Bank held tax returns for two individuals named in the subpoenas, their identities were withheld.\n\nMedia organizations including Reuters had asked the court to unseal the letter and reveal whose tax returns Deutsche Bank had on file from the Trump family. The court denied the motion on Thursday.\n\nHowever, in its ruling, the court said Deutsche Bank\u2019s letter revealed the tax returns it has for individuals or entities named in the subpoenas were not those of the president.\n\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment on the court\u2019s ruling. A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile campaigning for the presidency in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old convention of candidates releasing their tax returns publicly.\n\nA decision on whether Deutsche Bank needs to hand over the banking records of Trump, his children and businesses is still pending, the court confirmed.\n\nThe two congressional panels issued a joint 12-page subpoena in April seeking the records. Lawmakers requested documents that identify \u201cany financial relationship, transactions, or ties\u201d between Trump, his family members and his companies and \u201cany foreign individual, entity, or government\u201d, according to the subpoena.\n\nIn a separate ruling on Monday, a federal judge said eight years of Trump\u2019s tax returns must be provided to Manhattan prosecutors, forcefully rejecting the president\u2019s argument that he was immune from criminal investigations.", "description": "Deutsche Bank says it does not have copies of U.S. President Donald Trump's tax returns, a U.S. appeals court said on Thursday, closing one possible avenue for the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives to obtain the returns.", "authors": ["Matt Scuffham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439419345&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991IN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
