Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) issued a subpoena to Mr. Maguire, seeking to force him to turn over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which Mr. Schiff said the DNI\u2019s inspector general determined to be credible and a matter of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\nIn a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the DNI\u2019s general counsel told Mr. Schiff the agency \u201chas complied fully with all applicable law\u201d in handling the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, adding \u201cwe are disappointed\u201d by the subpoena and demands for Mr. Maguire to testify.\n\nThe general counsel, Jason Klitenic, wrote that it would be premature, at this juncture, for Mr. Maguire to appear at a congressional hearing Thursday, as Mr. Schiff demanded. He also wrote that the DNI wouldn\u2019t be able to turn over documents to the panel by Mr. Schiff\u2019s Tuesday deadline because the office needed to consult with other parts of the executive branch.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u201cremains committed to working with the Committee to reach an acceptable accommodation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Schiff said Tuesday night that he still expected to see Mr. Maguire on Thursday and that his committee \u201cwill take whatever steps are necessary\u201d to make sure that the whistleblower system works.\n\n\u201cHe needs to come in and explain not only to us but to the public why he is ignoring the plain language of the law and whether he\u2019s being instructed to do so,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll expect to see him, under subpoena if necessary, but we expect to see him.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiff suggested last week that the issues divulged by the whistleblower are being withheld to protect President Trump or other administration officials.\n\nIn the letter seen by the Journal, Mr. Klitenic said the concerns raised by the unidentified whistleblower concerned conduct by someone outside the U.S. intelligence community. Because the concerns didn\u2019t involve matters overseen by the DNI\u2019s office, he argued, they didn\u2019t meet the threshold of an issue of \u201curgent concern,\u201d which by law would require that the complaint be transmitted to Congress.\n\nAsked Tuesday morning about the standoff, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was aware of the issue but said \u201cwe\u2019re going down our own path.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a great deal of confidence in Dan Coats and deputy director Sue Gordon,\u201d Mr. Warner told The Journal, referring to Mr. Maguire\u2019s predecessor and his deputy, who resigned last month. \u201cI think it was our country\u2019s loss when they were forced out. I think Maguire is trying to do a good job, but any effort to politicize our intelligence community\u201d is of great concern.\n\n\u2014Dustin Volz contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Warren P.
