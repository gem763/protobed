[Emphasis added] A yellow gingham toddler top embroidered with flowers was among those clothes, listed on Amazon for $4.99 by a New York City retailer. The Journal traced the top to a factory in Chittagong, Bangladesh, that has no fire alarms and where doors are of a type managers can lock and keep workers in. A laborer at the factory, 18-year-old Nasreen Begum, said she spends 12-hour days there stitching shirts with 300 others. \u201cYou\u2019re trapped inside until the time you complete the orders,\u201d she said. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe Bangladesh factory, known as Riverside Apparels, that produced the yellow toddler top not only has awful working conditions, but the workers are subjected to substandard treatment.\n\n\u201cIn a noncompliant factory you don\u2019t get paid on time, you don\u2019t get a bonus like other factory workers and you don\u2019t get medical leave,\u201d one of the factory\u2019s supervisors told the Journal.\n\nTons of factories in Bangladesh have been blacklisted by some retailers as too dangerous and unethical to workers after the 2013 collapse of a Dhaka, Bangladesh factory that killed more than 1,000 garment workers \u2014 mostly women.\n\nStill, the Journal discovered that of the 122 blacklisted factories in Bangladesh, 67 sell their items to wholesalers who then sell the products on Amazon, and 33 of those factories have items listed on Walmart\u2019s website.\n\nAmazon was found to sell a variety of clothing, from pants to fishnet body stockings, that came from Bangladesh factories that have been blacklisted for their working conditions and treatment of workers. Amazon does not inspect any factories used by wholesalers or third-party sellers.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
