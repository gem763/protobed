Though it is understandable why central bankers are wedded to monetary stimulus, Hartnett warns that it is helping fuel a bond bubble that will burst next year as the U.S. economy enters recession.\n\n\u201cSince Wall Street is five times larger than the size of main street, and they [central bankers] have every incentive to do so [continue increasing stimulus] to reverse recession risk and the contagion from manufacturing and trade,\u201d Hartnett wrote.\n\n.\n\nBofA Merrill Lynch\n\nGiven that the point of central bank stimulus is to reinvigorate an economy, causing faster economic growth that ultimately leads to higher interest rates, investor behavior suggests that they don\u2019t believe policy will succeed. \u201cEveryone is positioned for the bond bubble to continue,\u201d Harnett wrote.\n\nCoordinated central bank action has reinvigorated the \u201ceverything rally,\u201d according to fund flow data from EPFR and BofA. During the week ended Sept. 11, both bond and equity funds saw inflows, with equity inflows of $14.4 billion ranking as the most since March of 2018. Bond funds saw smaller gains, boosted by flows into high yield funds, which brought $2.7 billion in new money, the most since June.\n\n\u201cInvestors are all in on the bond bubble,\u201d Hartnett wrote, pointing to record inflows this year into bond funds, record prices across the fixed-income markets and a \u201cwidespread belief central banks will keep rates extraordinarily low, plus a growing conviction U.S. rates can turn negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese factors have led to \u201cbond mania and a 2019 consensus capitulation into \u2018Japanification\u2019 theme,\u201d or the belief that the U.S. and Europe are headed toward the fate of Japan, an economy characterized by massive government debts and central bank intervention along with slow growth and chronic disinflation.\n\nHarnett argues, however that the belief in the bond bubble is misguided and will spell trouble. He offers what he describes as \u201cthe most important chart in the world,\u201d which he suggests indicates the bond bubble is about to burst, as the yield 10-year U.S. Treasury Note has consistently failed to remain below 1.5%.\n\nBof A Merrill Lynch\n\nMeanwhile, the market\u2019s belief that central banks have become \u201cimpotent\u201d to trigger inflation is misguided, Hartnett wrote. He points to the \u201cquit ratio\u201d or the share of Americans voluntarily leaving their job, which recently hit a cycle high. Movement in this measures has typically signaled faster wage growth, and implies 4% wage growth next year that will feed into growing economy-wide inflation.\n\nRising inflation will cause the bond-market bubble to pop, leading to higher yields that triggers a stock market top and central bank moves to raise interest rates in a failed attempt to head off inflation.\n\n\u201cNo impotence, big issuance, rising inflation means recent violent growth to value, defensives to cyclicals continues episodically in coming months,\u201d Hartnett wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re bearish risk assets in 2020 as bond bubble pop induces Big Top in credit & equities causing Wall St deleveraging & Main St recession.\u201d", "description": "Global central bankers are \u201cintent on smashing Wall Street bears out of the ballpark,\u201d according to Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR283_1927_y_ZG_20190913123535.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
