I don\u2019t need anybody. I don\u2019t need a name for this, a named actor. If you don\u2019t take this, I\u2019m gonna find an unknown actor and give it to him, because the movie doesn\u2019t really need you,\" he continued. \"But if you take the part, I\u2019ll give you 10 percent\" of the film's profits.\n\n\"I told John Krasinski this story when we were writing 'Promised Land.'\u2026 He goes: \u2018If you had done that movie, nothing in your life would be different. Nothing in your life would be different at all. Except that, right now, we would be having this conversation in space,'\" Damon explained. \"So, yeah. I\u2019ve left more money on the table than any actor actually.\n\nGQ did the math. Damon would have been a quarter of a billion dollars richer, since \"Avatar\" went on make $2.79 billion at the box office. It was the top-grossing movie of all time until \"Avengers: Endgame\" dethroned it this summer.\n\nMATT DAMON APOLOGIZES FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMMENTS\n\nDamon recalled that shooting \"Avatar\" would have conflicted with his \"Bourne\" series, and he \"couldn't do it.\"\n\n\u201cCameron said to me in the course of that conversation, \u2018Well, you know, I\u2019ve only made six movies.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize that. He works so infrequently, but his movies, you know all of them. So it feels like he\u2019s made more than he has,\" Damon said.\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\"I realized in having to say no that I was probably passing on the chance to ever work with him. So that sucked and that\u2019s still brutal. But my kids are all eating. I\u2019m doing OK,\" he joked.\n\nThe role ultimately went to Australian actor Sam Worthington, a relative unknown at the time.", "description": "Matt Damon is one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood but even he as regrets over roles he missed out on.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/damon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
