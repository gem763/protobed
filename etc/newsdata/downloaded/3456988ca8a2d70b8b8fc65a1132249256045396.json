John Lewis now plans to extend that to another 50 by the end of October.", "description": "The partnership is hit by \"difficult\" trading and says a no-deal Brexit would have a \"significant\" impact", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1143C/production/_108761707_johnlewiswindow_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
