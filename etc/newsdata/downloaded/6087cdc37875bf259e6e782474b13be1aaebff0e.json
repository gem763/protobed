You know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top.\u201d\n\nMr McConnell, a close ally of Donald Trump's, in July refused requests from Democratic senators to pass bills which aimed to beef up America\u2019s election infrastructure.\n\nHe argued the Trump administration was already making efforts to improve election security and that the bills were partisan in nature, despite them receiving support from senators of both parties.\n\nIt came a day after special counsel Robert Mueller told congress Russia was already attempting to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say anything and do anything. This is what we\u2019re up against with the hard left today in America,\u201d Mr McConnell added, despite the term apparently being coined by former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough.\n\nThe nickname soon caught on, with House majority speaker Nancy Pelosi last month referring to her colleague as \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d during a speech in Illinois in which she chided his blocking of legislation.\n\n\"We sent our legislation to the Senate,\" Ms Pelosi said. \"Moscow Mitch says that he is the grim reaper. Imagine describing yourself as the grim reaper, that he's going to bury all this legislation.\"\n\nMr McConnell has used the term \"grim reaper\" to describe his role in killing what he has characterised as far left legislation coming over from the Democrat-led House.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump insists China will suffer from trade war as US economy struggles\n\nLive: Trump's tweets 'repeatedly driving down stock market'\n\nNancy Pelosi calls Mitch McConnell 'Moscow Mitch' during speech", "description": "Mitch McConnell has angrily denounced critics who refer to him as \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d over the Senate majority leader\u2019s refusal to pass bipartisan laws protecting the US from Russian election interference.\u201cIt\u2019s modern day McCarthyism,\u201d Mr McConnell told right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday. \u201cUnbelievable", "authors": ["Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QWsHcOI9QP3dSt9BcVqXkw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/da0dc9cbc88b4783473007c5b471e4c1", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
