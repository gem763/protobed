As of the close of trading on Thursday, the shares had risen about 15% in 2019, slightly behind the gain in the S&P 500.\n\nThe stock has fallen from above $70, largely because management issued a less upbeat outlook for Etsy\u2019s full-year performance in early August. The company is making \u201cbold bets that set us up for an even brighter future,\u201d CEO Josh Silverman said at the time.\n\nOn Friday, Wedbush\u2019s Ygal Arounian said investors shouldn\u2019t worry. He upgraded the stock from Neutral to Outperform and raised his price target by $2 to $66, 20% above Thursday\u2019s closing price of $54.88. Among his reasons: the company\u2019s aforementioned \u201cbets,\u201d including the development of an ad platform and a push to get more sellers to offer free shipping.\n\nThose bets, Arounian wrote, represent a \u201ccritical mass\u201d that he thinks could boost growth in sales on Etsy\u2019s platform, as well as the company\u2019s margins. \u201cWe particularly like the timing with both Etsy Ads and free shipping launching into the holiday season supported by Etsy\u2019s brand marketing push,\u201d he wrote. Wedbush sees \u201cthe about 25% pullback in shares since July highs as a strong buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nThose sentiments echo others Barron\u2019s wrote about last month. Another analyst suggested that \u201cshort-term-oriented momentum investors may have exited positions.\u201d\n\nEtsy has also acquired a music marketplace it plans to operate separately, perhaps suggesting a willingness to use mergers and acquisitions to expand the markets it can tap.\n\nGiven \u201cmanagement\u2019s strong track record of improvements to date, we see a lot more to come,\u201d Arounian wrote.\n\nEmail David Marino-Nachison at david.marino-nachison@barrons.com.
