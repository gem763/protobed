We don\u2019t ask foreign governments to help us in our elections.\u201d\n\nPelosi was due to meet with all House of Representatives Democrats later on Tuesday to map out a way forward after the nation\u2019s top spy officials refused to hand over a complaint from an intelligence whistleblower that reportedly deals with a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nPelosi said it was clear that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was breaking the law in withholding the complaint from Congress at the direction of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi, however, declined to say what the next steps might be from the House as Democratic lawmakers try to force the administration to hand over the complaint.", "description": "U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday it would be wrong if President Donald Trump asked Ukraine to launch an investigation into a political opponent, even if he did not tie the request to the release of millions of dollar in U.S. aid.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433550252&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N2C5", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
