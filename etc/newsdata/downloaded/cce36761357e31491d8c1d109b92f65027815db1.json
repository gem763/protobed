Last year, there was an attempt to assassinate a former Russian spy in Britain using a nerve agent. Though the operations bore the fingerprints of Russia\u2019s intelligence services, authorities initially saw them as isolated, unconnected attacks.\n\nWestern security officials have now concluded that these operations, and potentially many others, are part of a coordinated and ongoing campaign to destabilize Europe, executed by an elite unit inside the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage and assassination.\n\nThe group, known as Unit 29155, has operated for at least a decade, yet Western officials only recently discovered it. Intelligence officials in four Western countries say it is unclear how often the unit is mobilized and warn that it is impossible to know when and where its operatives will strike.\n\nThe purpose of Unit 29155, which has not been previously reported, underscores the degree to which Russian President Vladimir Putin is actively fighting the West with his brand of so-called hybrid warfare \u2014 a blend of propaganda, hacking attacks and disinformation \u2014 as well as open military confrontation.\n\n\u201cI think we had forgotten how organically ruthless the Russians could be,\u201d said Peter Zwack, a retired military intelligence officer and former defense attach\u00e9 at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, who said he was not aware of the unit\u2019s existence.\n\nIn a text message, Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, directed questions about the unit to the Russian Defense Ministry. The ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHidden behind concrete walls at the headquarters of the 161st Special Purpose Specialist Training Center in eastern Moscow, the unit sits within the command hierarchy of the Russian military intelligence agency, widely known as the GRU.\n\nThough much about GRU operations remains a mystery, Western intelligence agencies have begun to get a clearer picture of its underlying architecture. In the months before the 2016 presidential election, U.S. officials say two GRU cyber units, known as 26165 and 74455, hacked into the servers of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and then published embarrassing internal communications.\n\nLast year, Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, indicted more than a dozen officers from those units, though all still remain at large. The hacking teams mostly operate from Moscow, thousands of miles from their targets.\n\nBy contrast, officers from Unit 29155 travel to and from European countries. Some are decorated veterans of Russia\u2019s bloodiest wars, including in Afghanistan, Chechnya and Ukraine. Its operations are so secret, according to assessments by Western intelligence services, that the unit\u2019s existence is most likely unknown even to other GRU operatives.\n\nThe unit appears to be a tight-knit community. A photograph taken in 2017 shows the unit\u2019s commander, Maj. Gen. Andrei V. Averyanov, at his daughter\u2019s wedding in a gray suit and bow tie. He is posing with Col. Anatoly V. Chepiga, one of two officers indicted in Britain over the poisoning of a former spy, Sergei Skripal.\n\n\u201cThis is a unit of the GRU that has been active over the years across Europe,\u201d said one European security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe classified intelligence matters. \u201cIt\u2019s been a surprise that the Russians, the GRU, this unit, have felt free to go ahead and carry out this extreme malign activity in friendly countries. That\u2019s been a shock.\u201d\n\nTo varying degrees, each of the four operations linked to the unit attracted public attention, even as it took time for authorities to confirm that they were connected. Western intelligence agencies first identified the unit after the failed 2016 coup in Montenegro, which involved a plot by two unit officers to kill the country\u2019s prime minister and seize the parliament building.\n\nBut officials began to grasp the unit\u2019s specific agenda of disruption only after the March 2018 poisoning of Skripal, a former GRU officer who had betrayed Russia by spying for the British. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, fell grievously ill after exposure to a highly toxic nerve agent, but survived.", "description": "First came a destabilization campaign in Moldova, followed by the poisoning of an arms dealer in Bulgaria and then a thwarted coup in Montenegro.
