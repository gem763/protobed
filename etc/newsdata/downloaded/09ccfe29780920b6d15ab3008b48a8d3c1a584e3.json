Defend, grab rebounds, on offense set some picks and roll hard to the rim then catch any lobs thrown your way. That\u2019s it. In his last few stops, Howard pushed back against this kind of smaller role, wanting more touches \u2014 and more touches in the post, where he is not efficient \u2014 and with that (and some leadership questions) becoming somewhat of a distraction. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s bounced around the league despite putting up decent numbers for a few years in places such as Houston and Charlotte.\n\nThe Lakers have bet things are different, although with the non-guaranteed contract they gave him the Lakers have hedged that bet. They are betting he\u2019s healthy \u2014 he only played nine games for the Wizards last season and had another back surgery \u2014 and they are betting he\u2019ll accept his role. They are betting LeBron James and Anthony Davis can keep him in line. Howard is saying all the right things, but there are plenty of skeptics around the league because Howard has said all the right things before.\n\nLaker coach Frank Vogel, in an interview on the Lakers\u2019 local cable channel Spectrum Sports Net, talked about Howard and the Lakers\u2019 hopes (hat tip NBA Rumors).", "description": "\"It\u2019s gonna be more of a role player type of role as opposed to being the lead and he understands that.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/j4Cy4wUQ3Qw5YTwt86lcvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PmOS1cu_PZprmHNCGrMU7g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/865fc059bf2850d754641d0ade22ff1d"}
