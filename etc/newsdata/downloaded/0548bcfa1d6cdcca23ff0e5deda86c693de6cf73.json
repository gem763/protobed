Over 50 percent are low-income students,\" she said. \"And, national polls have consistently shown that support among black Democrats and Hispanic Democrats for charter schools is extremely high. For black Democrats, it\u2019s about 50 percent, for Hispanics it\u2019s roughly 50 percent.\"\n\n\"[Charter] schools have more independence. They have more autonomy to hire the best teachers, to expand the school day and the school year without having to negotiate with a central bureaucracy,\" Rees added. \"That flexibility is paramount to the achievements that they\u2019re gaining and that is disrupting the system.\"\n\nShe also said charter schools have been designed for students who had trouble learning and felt left behind by the public school system.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The majority of the students attending charter schools are students who were traditionally not being served very well by the establishment, by the traditional school districts,\" she said. \"Most of them are low-income students. A good number of them are special needs students... So they\u2019re going to these schools because these schools are offering a better option than what they were getting in that one-size-fits-all system.\"\n\nRees added, \"When you compare apples to apples, you still see that there\u2019s something in the charter school water that is benefiting the students in the system and you certainly don\u2019t want to confine low-income families, in particular, into schools that their parents don\u2019t want them to attend.\"", "description": "As Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump\u00a0in 2020\u00a0call for funding to be diverted from charter schools, National\u00a0Alliance for Public Charter Schools\u00a0president Nina Rees accused the party of\u00a0bowing to teachers' unions\u00a0in exchange for sizable campaign contributions.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
