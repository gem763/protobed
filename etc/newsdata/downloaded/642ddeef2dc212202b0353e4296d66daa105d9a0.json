Fighting terrorists, exercising leadership and troubled regions and advancing U.S. interests around the world does not make us an evil empire or the world's policeman,' McConnell said.\n\nThis picture taken on October 15, 2019 shows a missile fired by Turkish forces towards the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, from the Turkish side of the border at Ceylanpinar district in Sanliurfa on the first week of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces\n\nMcConnell shared his 'grave concern' about the situation in Syria\n\n'When it looked like President Trump would withdraw from Syria at beginning of the year, 70 senators joined in warning of the risk of precipitously withdrawing from Syria or Afghanistan,' McConnell noted in his floor speech\n\nMcConnell had also warned of his 'grave concern' in a written statement Monday that did not mention Trump by name. But in his floor speech Tuesday, he included such a reference.\n\n'When it looked like President Trump would withdraw from Syria at beginning of the year, 70 senators joined in warning of the risk of precipitously withdrawing from Syria or Afghanistan,' McConnell noted.\n\nBut even as he challenged the president on a policy that has resulted in the release of ISIS prisoners, led to attacks against key regional allies, and even led to shelling by Turkish forces toward a U.S. troop-held position, he defended the president on impeachment by attacking Democrats.\n\n'House Democrats are finally indulging in their impeachment obsession. Full steam ahead,' McConnell warned. 'I don't think many of us were expecting to witness a clinic in terms of fairness or due process. But even by their own partisan standards, House Democrats have already found new ways to lower the bar,' he complained.\n\nMcConnell has said he was required by Senate rules to hold a trial should the House impeach Trump.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took on President Trump's contention that having forces remain in Syria was akin to being the 'world's policeman' and criticized the president's moves.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19758976-0-image-a-13_1571173743823.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
