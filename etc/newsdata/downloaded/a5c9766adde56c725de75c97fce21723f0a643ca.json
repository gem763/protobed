The consortium had initially planned to roll out the platform sometime in 2020.\n\nThe consortium was established in July this year, with all three major telecoms companies, KT, SK and LG U+, teaming up with Samsung, as well as banks KEB Hana and Woori and financial IT company Koscom.\n\nHowever, the size and scope of the project have increased substantially, with credit card issuers BC Card and Hyundai Card joining on October 20, along with banks Shinhan and Nonghyup (NH).\n\nNH says it wants to use the platform to create a blockchain-powered mobile \u201cpass\u201d as an ID solution for its banking services, while BC Card wants to use blockchain technology for card issuance. Hyundai Card, meanwhile, says it wants to \u201cstreamline internal and customer services\u201d using the solution.\n\nThe project has also been backed by government agencies and ministries, and its operators could look to the international market, as the solution will be compatible with GSM mobile protocols.\n\nAccording to Chosun, six South Korean universities have already indicated that they will offer blockchain certification via the new platform. South Korean Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) certificate issuers are also keen to make use of the new solution.\n\nThe consortium is now 11 companies strong, and its operators say it will also allow citizens to use the following blockchain-powered, mobile-based documentation:\n\nProof of earnings\n\nMedical receipts for insurance claims\n\nProof of employment\n\nProof of purchase for valuable works of art\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung\u2019s IT services arm Samsung SDS has announced it is stepping up its collaboration with Indian business giant Mahindra.\n\nThe two companies have teamed up with American software developer Pega to sign a blockchain deal.\n\nPer an official release, the companies will integrate the Samsung SDS Nexledger blockchain platform with Pega\u2019s digital process automation network.\n\nThe companies say they will create supply chain solutions intended for the banking and financial sector, insurance companies, the manufacturing industry and public services.", "description": "Eleven South Korean companies are teaming up for a government-backed \u201cconsortium-type\u201d blockchain network that will allow citizens to ditch paper-based certificates, employee ID cards, degree certificates, insurance claims documents and more in favor of a mobile-based blockchain solution.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/d2ccea91da.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
