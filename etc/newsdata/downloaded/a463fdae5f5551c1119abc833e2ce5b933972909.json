Princess Mako's aunt, Princess Sayako, became the last royal to be stripped of her status when wed a Tokyo city official in 2005.\n\nPrincess Mako announced her intention to marry Mr Komuro, who works at a law firm, in 2017. Shortly afterwards it was announced the pair would wed in November 2018.\n\nThe wedding was later postponed until 2020, with an official statement saying the couple needed more time to plan. However reports have since emerged suggesting Mr Komuro's family is involved in a financial dispute of which his in-laws disapprove.\n\nIn July the Crown Prince said he did not know whether his daughter's marriage will take place, the Japan Times reported.\n\nThe public interest surrounding Princess Mako's status within the family sheds light on another issue facing Japan's royals: the lack of male heirs eligible to take the throne.\n\nPrincess Mako (in blue) has taken on a more active role within the family in the months since her uncle was made Emperor and her father heir to the throne in May. Pictured (l-r) Princess Kako, 24, and Princess Mako with parents Crown Princess Kiko and Crown Prince Fumihito\n\nThe Imperial Household Law of 1947 stipulates that only males in the family\u2019s male line can ascend to the throne.\n\nIt means that while Emperor Naruhito has a daughter Aiko, 17, it is his brother the Crown Prince who takes precedence.\n\nSimilarly the Crown Prince's daughters, Mako and Kako, 24, will be passed over in favour of his son Prince Hisahito, 13.\n\nThere is only one other man - the Emperor's 83-year-old uncle, Prince Hitachi - who is eligible under current rules.\n\nEnd of the line: Princess Mako is expected to lose her royal titles when she marries Kei Komuro, whom she met while studying at International Christian University (ICU) and is set to marry next year after postponing their wedding in 2018. Pictured, the princess in 2011\n\nThe threat of a crisis of succession has prompted action from Japanese lawmakers.\n\nToday members of Japan's ruling party finalised proposals to allow men from previously severed branches of the imperial family to be rejoin in a bid to increase the number of male heirs.\n\nProposals include allowing these distant royal relatives to be 'adopted' into the primary bloodline, or to marry female members.\n\nThere is currently no move to change Imperial Law to instate female members of the family into the line of succession.", "description": "Princess Mako of Japan was the picture of regal poise as she embraced her new high profile role by taking on official duties at her uncle Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony yesterday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Linning For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/13/20082002-0-image-a-2_1571832032157.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
