He said: \u2018Let\u2019s go to Johannesburg to see the ANCWL.\u2019 When we got there, it was only Nomvula Mokonyane at the meeting. I didn\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nMokonyane, who is in mourning following the death of her husband, spoke passionately at Watson\u2019s memorial in August, saying it was not anyone\u2019s place to judge Watson, who died in a car accident near OR Tambo International Airport.\n\n\u201cWhat he was doing together with Angelo Agrizzi [who detailed Watson\u2019s corrupt dealings at the state capture inquiry], only his Creator will deal with. Who are we to judge? What we know is that every day Gavin used to say: \u2018Forgive us for our trespasses.\u2019\u201d\n\nAgrizzi, together with Bosasa\u2019s former head of facilities and fleet, Frans Vorster, revealed the extent of Bosasa\u2019s hold on the ANC and Watson\u2019s closeness to Mokonyane at the inquiry into state capture earlier this year.\n\nBoth told of how close Watson and Mokonyane were, with Vorster testifying as follows: \u201cWe always had to jump when it was for her and make sure that she [got] special treatment. She did not wait for anything. If he [Watson] said \u2018Do that\u2019, you would do it immediately and make sure whatever was asked was delivered.\u201d\n\nMokonyane, said Vorster, was \u201clike an employee at Bosasa; she was there the whole time, and it became apparent over the years that she was like the key person \u2026 and had huge political contacts even to [then president Jacob Zuma]\u201d.\n\nWATSON\u2019S TAKEOVER\n\nIt was at the height of the media storm around Bosasa\u2019s operations at Lindela that the ANCWL leaders were getting dragged into the matter.\n\nHilda Ndude, an ANCWL leader who left her role in the Western Cape legislature to run the women\u2019s new company, Dyambu, said Watson \u2013 who had been brought in only to help the women run the business \u2013 advised them \u201cto form a company, Dyambu Operations\u201d with the sole purpose of \u201cadding a feminine touch\u201d to the largely unreformed mining industry at the time.\n\nWhen Lindela was in the media for alleged poor housing conditions for foreigners who were awaiting repatriation, the ANCWL leaders \u201ccould not be seen as running an inhuman, unhealthy facility where African women and children were being detained and maltreated\u201d.\n\nIn a board meeting, Pikoli recalled how the women wanted out of the controversial Lindela contract, saying: \u201cWe all spoke with one voice that we did not want to be associated with this new venture at all, and that our company name must be removed from anything to do with the home affairs contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe exited Dyambu Operations because we did not want to be involved in things involving government tenders,\u201d said Myakayaka-Manzini.\n\nNdude told Watson to leave the ANCWL leaders out of the Lindela controversy, and he used this opportunity to get his grip on the whole entity.\n\nThe book reveals that on August 3 2000, Watson persuaded Ndude to sign an acquisition letter that would \u201cdelink\u201d the women from the Lindela operation.\n\nThis would prove to be the master stroke that Watson wanted in order to get his hands on the company.\n\nNdude said she was shocked when Watson said he wanted to buy them out: \u201cIn hindsight, I realised how stupid we were. Gavin took us for a ride because it was our company 100%.\n\n\u201cHe used our names. Gavin Watson\u2019s name was never anywhere. He was using us to bulldoze into the mines, to get him more business opportunities.\n\n\u201cGavin is the biggest manipulator \u2026 Gavin knows how to corrupt people because he realised black people don\u2019t know anything about money, especially the comrades, because really, we were never involved in issues of money. All that he wanted was people with struggle credentials,\u201d Ndude said.\n\nIn the letter to delink the women leaders from the controversy surrounding Lindela, Watson outlined the conditions of the sale of the women\u2019s shares, which he said were worth R5.5 million.\n\nOf this, R1 million would be paid on signature of the agreement, along with a monthly R83 333 payment for 48 months, minus expenses for the Sandton office (which Ndude was confined to), and her flat and vehicle rental.\n\nA further R500 000 would be paid on October 31 2001. Ndude swore that she did not receive a cent.\n\nAt the end of 2000, Watson had gotten rid of the ANCWL leaders from Dyambu Operations and changed the company name to Bosasa.\n\nThe book details how Watson was brought into Dyambu to assist the women leaders since they had no knowledge of running the business.\n\nThe formation of the company to benefit the leaders was discussed at Mapisa-Nqakula\u2019s home in Johannesburg, where Watson\u2019s older brother, Ronnie \u2013 a family friend of Mapisa-Nqakula and her husband, Charles Nqakula \u2013 was present.\n\nMapisa-Nqakula stressed that Dyambu was never a front company of the ANCWL but was formed by a group of leaders in their personal capacity.\n\n\u201cWe were very raw. We had no clue about business,\u201d she said.\n\nNdude said the women did not see any conflict of interest between themselves as politicians and the company, which had contracts to clean and cater in the mines.\n\n\u201cWe clarified that from the onset with Ronnie \u2026 but Ronnie coaxed them that they shouldn\u2019t be shy to use their political influence by saying: \u2018No, man, you guys know how to talk, you are leaders, you\u2019ll be able to convince the workers,\u2019\u201d said Ndude.\n\n\u201cWe designed everything [the company name and branding], and Gavin was going to run the entity for us. He was brought in to be the overall manager of all operations and business activities of Dyambu.\n\n\u201cWe needed someone who was knowledgeable in running a business. Remember, we inherited businesses already in operation at various mines.\u201d\n\nTHE SISTERS\u2019 FALLOUT\n\nThe book further reveals that at the time of the Lindela controversy, tension started brewing between Ndude and the other women.\n\n\u201cThe ladies were getting frustrated because Gavin would speak to me as if he was paying dividends to me,\u201d said Ndude.\n\n\u201cI was just paid a salary. They were angry with me, because they thought I took the money that he told them about.\u201d\n\nDistrust between Ndude and her colleagues \u2013 she called them friends \u2013 grew as no money was flowing from Dyambu\u2019s business to their pockets.\n\n\u201cWe became deeply disappointed by the person we\u2019d appointed to become chief executive officer [Ndude],\u201d said Mapisa-Nqakula.\n\nNdude was one of a disgruntled group of ANC politicians who left the party to start the Congress of the People (Cope) with leaders Mosiuoa Lekota and Mbhazima Shilowa.\n\nShe succumbed to the lure of money and was convicted of looting funds from Cope.\n\n\u201cI asked for forgiveness and made peace with God. All the good that I have done [during the struggle] will be wiped out \u2026 I will be lumped together with those corrupt ones,\u201d said Nduda.", "description": "A new book details how the controversial businessman tricked the women into signing their company over.", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9494/3afe943e40a44e1288b59abba7e17b68.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
