After the Astros won Game 3 on Friday night, Sunday night's game and Trump's presumed attendance became official.\n\nAccording to Washington's CBS affiliate WUSA9, the Nationals owners had specifically asked MLB to ensure they would not be put in a position to accept or deny a request from the president to sit alongside them in the owner's suite.\n\nWhile Trump was in the crowd, he did not receive the honor of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch on Sunday night. Instead, renowned chef, activist, and vocal Trump critic Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s began the evening, throwing the first pitch to Nationals veteran Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nTrump joked when asked on Friday if he would be throwing out the first pitch.\n\n\"I don't know. They gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armor,\" Trump said. \"I'll look too heavy. I don't like that.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump did not receive a warm reception on Sunday night while attending Game 5 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db642b4dee01904926c4e22?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
