Let\u2019s start with what open-borders advocates themselves call their \u201cUnderground Railroad\u201d of migrant safe houses that extend across Central America, through Mexico, and up and into the U.S\u2026 This sprawling network of aid stations has been in place for years, bolstered by global interests, left-wing activists, and religious institutions that advocate for illegal aliens\u2026\n\nIn 2012, for example, the United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Mexico signed \u201ccooperation agreements\u201d with three migrant shelters along Mexico\u2019s southern border to support their work assisting \u201cirregulars\u201d traveling through the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca on their way to the U.S. The IOM pact guaranteed supplies of medicine, hygiene products, construction materials, as well as therapy services and legal training at the previously mentioned Hermanos en el Camino shelter, along with the Catholic-run Hogar de la Misericordia shelter and Jesus el Buen Pastor del Pobre y el Migrante shelter. IOM extended similar aid to nine other migrant shelters in the northern and central parts of Mexico, from Chihuahua, Sonora, and Tamaulipas along the northern border to San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and Tlaxcala in the center of the country\u2026\n\nOn the southern border of Mexico in Chiapas, the city of Tapachula is the first entry point for Central Americans headed to the U.S. There, the Fray Mat\u00edas de C\u00f3rdova Human Rights Center provides \u201ccomprehensive support\u201d to illegal alien travelers, including legal consultations, monitoring detention centers, and offering \u201conline resources, art and\n\nsocial activities, job training, and basic social services to migrants.\u201d\u2026\n\nAlso in Tapachula, the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) opens its churches and pastoral centers to provide shelter, monetary aid, voluntary aid, and emergency assistance. Its team of lawyers, psychologists, social workers, and Jesuit clergy spread from Tapachula to Comalapa and Mexico City. JRS staff served as Sherpas for the 2018 caravan marchers and liaisons with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR)\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of travel guides through the expansive network of Catholic volunteers. JRS is part of a binational coalition called the Kino Border Initiative (KBI) stationed in Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, since 2009. Along with JRS, the partners who provide \u201cdirect humanitarian assistance and accompaniment\u201d with migrants on the trespassing path are: the California Province of the Society of Jesus, the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, the Mexican Province of the Society of Jesus, the Diocese of Tucson and the Diocese of Nogales\u2026\n\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e9res (MSF)/Doctors Without Borders facilitates illegal immigration at our southern doorstep as well as across the Mediterranean Sea, as you\u2019ll see in chapter two. Since 2012, the group boasts, its activists have been providing medical care and mental health care in Mexico to migrants and refugees from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador moving along the migratory route up through Mexico toward the U.S. MSF personnel are on the scene at migrant shelters and mobile clinics that parallel La Bestia railway lines. In addition, the organization opened a comprehensive health center in Mexico City in 2016 for caravan participants. Psychologists, medical doctors, and social workers are at the ready, along with staff who provide a full range of caravan concierge services: \u201cguidance, information on the migrant route and legal rights,\u201d plus \u201creferrals to second and third level medical and mental health service providers.\u201d MSF workers treat \u201cdehydration, skin infections, fatigue, acute stress, anxiety and depression,\u201d injuries from traveling on top of freight trains, and \u201cinjuries from violent incidents.\u201d \u2026\n\nThe Mexico City region hosts a multitude of casas de migrantes. The El Samaritano migrant house provides meals, baths, medical care, and phone services. It is conveniently located along the train tracks, and has become an inevitable magnet for narcotics and human trafficking. \u201cWe will be here until the last migrant passes through,\u201d El Samaritano\u2019s Sister Rosa Bogado vowed to a Miami Herald reporter. At Casa Mambr\u00e9, a special LGBTQI unit houses transgender migrants who receive separate shelter and psychotherapy services. Casa Toch\u00e1n (which means \u201cour house\u201d in Nahuatl) teaches guests how to do woodwork and sell artisan crafts. Families bunking at CAFEMIN (Casa de Acogida, Formaci\u00f3n y Empoderamiento de la Mujer y Internacional y Nacional, or \u201cHouse for Shelter, Training and Empowerment of International and National Women\u201d) bake bread and receive asylum advice. Casa del Migrante de Saltillo is gated and has \u201cstunning\u201d mountain views and close proximity to the train tracks. It provides three free meals a day and sells additional snacks and calling cards. Canada, the Netherlands, and the European Union provide donations to the migrant shelter.\n\nNext up: Yelp ratings and TripAdvisor reviews for illegal alien shelters? (I say this only half tongue in cheek. There is already a site called Contratados.org, which is billed as a Yelp or TripAdvisor-style tool that \u201clets migrant workers rate their experience of recruiters or employers online, by voicemail or by text message.\u201d)\n\nMichelle Malkin is the author of Open Borders, Inc.
