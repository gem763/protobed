Its common spaces, Mulvaney insisted, are perfect. There\u2019d even be plenty of room for the media, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s difficulties going various places,\u201d Mulvaney insisted. \u201cThere\u2019s one place, I won\u2019t say where it was, we actually had to figure out if we were going to have oxygen tanks for the participants, because of the altitude.\u201d\n\nThe Doral Resort, thankfully, is at sea level.\n\nIt would be \u201cdramatically cheaper\u201d to do it there, Mulvaney said, because the Trump Organization is doing the event at cost. When asked about the free marketing that the Trump resort would get from hosting such a huge summit, Mulvaney brushed off the question.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is probably strong enough as it is, and he probably doesn\u2019t need any more help on that,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nMulvaney also said Trump still believes the G7 should once again be the G8, with Russian President Vladimir Putin invited to attend. Russia was suspended from the group in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe president has been very candid about whether he wants Russia to rejoin the G7, they used to be part of that organization,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cWe go to the G7 and what dominates so much of the discussion? Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to have them inside as part of the conversation?\u201d\n\nBut hosting a major diplomatic summit a resort he owns and making money off of it is nothing like the self-dealing that Trump\u2019s has been accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of, Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump has insisted that Biden, while serving as Vice President helped his son, Hunter, get on the board of a gas company in Ukraine that paid him $50,000 a month. \u201cThere\u2019s no profit here,\u201d Mulvaney insisted.\n\nBut hosting a major diplomatic summit at his own resort and making money off of it is nothing like the self-dealing that Trump\u2019s been accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of, Mulvaney said.\n\nTrump has insisted that Biden, while serving as vice president, helped his son Hunter get on the board of a gas company in Ukraine that paid him $50,000 a month. \u201cThere\u2019s no profit here,\u201d Mulvaney insisted.\n\nAsked how the president would stand on a 2020 debate stage next to Joe Biden, if Biden is the Democratic nominee, and accuse him of such self-dealing after hosting the G7 at his own resort, Mulvaney said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to do that extraordinarily well.\u201d\n\nAnd though the Doral resort is in Miami, which is sinking into the ocean as sea levels rise due to global warming, \u201cClimate change will not be on the agenda,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nCover: A Trump National Doral sign is seen at the golf resort owned by U.S. President Donald Trump's company on August 27, 2019 in Doral, Florida.
