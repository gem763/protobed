(Photo: TShum/Getty Images)\n\nIn September 2019, actress Linda Hamilton \u2014 best known for her portrayal of Sarah Connor in the Terminator films \u2014 revealed to The New York Times that she\u2019d been practicing celibacy for 15 years. Not surprisingly, this piqued the public\u2019s interest.\n\nHere was this celebrity, openly embracing the choice not to have sex. Not for religious reasons, but simply because it is her choice. So, this got us thinking: Everyone always talks about the health benefits of having sex, but are there benefits of abstaining from it as well?\n\nTo find out, we reached out to a few sex and health experts, whose answers might surprise you. Whether you\u2019ve intentionally sworn off sex or you\u2019re just in a dry spell, prepare to have your feelings about celibacy bolstered by the ways being celibate can boost your health.\n\n1. IT GIVES YOU MORE MENTAL FOCUS AND CLARITY\n\nThere are actually a few purely practical health benefits to being celibate. Adina Mahalli, a certified relationship consultant and sexual health expert for Maple Holistics, discussed with us how not having sex frees up your focus.\n\n\u201cSex is great, but thinking about it all the time can easily cloud your judgment and inhibit logical and clear thinking. The common saying \u2018thinking with your little head instead of your big head\u2019 demonstrates this issue. Sex is an incredibly complicated and deep act that affects people\u2019s emotional state, brain chemistry and hormones,\u201d explained Mahalli, adding, \u201cAbstaining from sex can help people who are looking to make more logical judgements in their lives or to think more clearly.\u201d\n\nPer Mahalli, it only takes a few months of being celibate (including masturbation) for your sex drive to drop enough to increase your ability to look at situations more logically. \u201cAbstinence is also a way to help realign your emotions, brain chemistry and hormone levels if you feel that something may be wrong in any of those areas. This physiological alignment, mental clarity and logical thinking can benefit you in multiple areas in your life \u2014 work, social life and even help you find a suitable partner,\u201d said Mahalli.\n\n2. IT ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD A MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP FOUNDATION\n\nAnd speaking of relationships, Mahalli points out that being celibate while in a relationship can strengthen it. \u201cWhen getting into a new relationship, sex can easily cloud your perception of your new partner because of oxytocin release (the love chemical) in the brain,\u201d she said. \u201cThis chemical is released but is slowed after about six months, which is why the vast majority of relationships either end or begin to develop issues at this time.\u201d\n\nMore: Why you need more color in your life, according to a psychologist\n\n3. BEING CELIBATE EXEMPLIFIES A TYPE OF CONSENSUAL SEX LIFE\n\nThe Sex & Please Book cover (Photo: Good Vibrations)\n\nWhat\u2019s also interesting to note is that not being celibate and being sex-positive are not mutually exclusive. Dr. Carol Queen \u2014 author of The Sex & Pleasure Book: Good Vibrations Guide to Sex for Everyone, as well as a staff sexologist and curator of the Antique Vibrator Museum \u2014 elaborated on this point.\n\n\u201cThe important element here is that the celibate person has chosen to be celibate. Sex-positive doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is having a ton of sex \u2014 it means that each person should be able to create the [consensual] sex life that\u2019s right for them unimpeded by outside restrictions, which includes the option of celibacy,\u201d said Dr. Queen.\n\n4. CELIBACY CAN PROMOTE POSITIVE SELF-ESTEEM AND SELF-CARE\n\nReal talk: Sex can complicate everything \u2014 having one (or more) sexual partners can have myriad effects on a person\u2019s well-being, some more desirable than others. As Dr. Queen explained, \u201cPartners can affect one\u2019s finances, mental health, ability to make one\u2019s own choices. For some people, a journey toward optimal well-being will include taking at least some time away from these kinds of connections. There may be positive self-esteem implications of taking oneself off the market, too, in the sense that some people measure their self-worth partly according to how successfully they can attract partners or sexual interest.\u201d\n\n5. SOLO EXPERIENCES HAVE MANY OF THE PERKS OF PARTNERED SEX\n\nDr. Queen also clarified that there is a difference between having no sexual experiences of any kind (including masturbation) and having no partnered sex. While some of the perceived health benefits mentioned here are only related to partnered sex, if your celibacy includes solo sexual experience, you\u2019re also getting many of the health benefits ascribed to sex.\n\nMore: I tried 6 happiness hacks backed by science \u2014 here\u2019s what actually worked\n\n6. BEING CELIBATE (FOR A TIME) CAN INCREASE YOUR ENJOYMENT\n\nSo, let\u2019s say your celibacy is just temporary \u2014 whether self-imposed or you sort of stumbled into it. Should you decide at some point you would like to move toward an active sex life, your time being celibate could have a rather positive effect. \u201cTaking a break from sex helps restore your enjoyment of the act, as well as your appreciation of all your non-sexual and pre-sexual interactions,\u201d Ken Blackman, the principal engineer behind OM (orgasmic meditation), told us.\n\nBlackman has an easy-to-understand analogy to help explain, saying, \u201cHaving sex whenever your desire rises above, say, a three out of 10, is like eating an entire meal whenever your hunger rises above a three out of 10. Not only do you get bloated, but you lose your capacity to savor the meal. It becomes harder and harder to really enjoy each bite as a sensual experience.\u201d\n\nBasically, absence makes the heart (or, ahem, whatever) grow fonder. \u201cGiving yourself some time to remember what it feels like to want sex, and really savoring that feeling of desire, will heighten your senses, make you more present, and boost your enjoyment of the entire experience, from flirting to touching,\u201d said Blackman, offering one final piece of advice for those transitioning toward a more sexual life: The longer you don\u2019t have sex, the more intense your enjoyment will be when \u2014 or if \u2014 you do.\n\nWant to learn more about things good for your health?
