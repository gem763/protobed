McCain has been dead for nearly seven months, so this itself seems to betray that Trumpworld has a rather dim view of those voters.\n\nBut it\u2019s why this is the case that\u2019s of interest here. Trump allies believe McCain symbolizes \u201ceverything his core voters have come to loathe\u201d about \u201cthe GOP\u2019s political elite,\u201d including its support for the Russia probe and its \u201copposition to Trump\u2019s nativist agenda.\u201d\n\nMississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel (R) defends Trump\u2019s attacks by claiming his voters see McCain as the \u201cembodiment\u201d of the sort of \u201clifetime career politician\u201d who left them feeling \u201cpowerless and voiceless for many years,\u201d until Trump arrived.\n\nGOP consultant Mike Shields claims Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain tap his voters\u2019 frustration with \u201cpoliticians that lie to them\u201d and \u201caren\u2019t real,\u201d whereas these attacks show Trump is \u201creal.\u201d Trump\u2019s outsider authenticity turns out to be a willingness to slime a dead man who can\u2019t defend himself.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) defends Trump\u2019s rage at McCain as \u201creasonable,\u201d because McCain wanted to \u201cstick it to the president\u201d when he voted against repealing Obamacare in 2017.\n\nAnd in a new interview with Fox News, Trump himself makes similar claims. He rips into McCain as \u201chorrible\u201d for voting against Obamacare repeal, adding: \u201cWe would have had great health care.\u201d And he slams McCain for turning over to the FBI the \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d which he claims was \u201cpaid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.\u201d\n\nThus, the narrative Trumpworld is spinning is that, in attacking McCain, Trump is standing up for his voters, by going after a symbol of the GOP elites he campaigned against and of the deep-state forces working against the will of those voters, and those who blocked him from delivering on his health-care promises.\n\nMy intention here is not to defend or exalt McCain, but rather to look at what all this says about what a con this whole presidency really is.\n\nNothing but scams\n\nTrump did not merely promise to repeal Obamacare. He also vowed to replace it with \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d He explicitly campaigned on the idea that his desire to give people health care made him different from GOP elites. But he sold out on this promise, by embracing the actual goal of GOP elites: rolling back Obamacare\u2019s coverage and protections for millions without meaningfully replacing them.\n\nBecause this was so unpopular, Republicans employed extraordinary partisan tactics and secrecy to try to push it through. This procedural abuse is what McCain voted against. He blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to conspire with GOP elites to sell out on his promise to his voters.\n\nThat\u2019s of a piece with Trump\u2019s broader selling-out of his economic populism. After getting elected by promising to drain the swamp of elite corruption and take on the plutocrats who rig our political economy to enrich themselves, he gave those elites a deregulation spree that further rigged the economy in their favor, and a corporate tax cut that lavished enormous benefits on top earners. (As it happens, this is an area where Trump and McCain broadly agree.)\n\nAll that\u2019s left of Trump\u2019s vow to take on elites and to give health care to everybody is his attacks on one member of the elite who is dead. This is what honoring his promise to voters has been reduced to?\n\nAbsurd lies designed to evade accountability\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on McCain over the Steele dossier are similarly absurd \u2014 and revealing. The implication is that McCain conspired against Trump\u2019s election and then joined the deep-state coup to reverse it. But the idea that Clinton is behind the dossier is complete nonsense, McCain didn\u2019t get the dossier until after the election, and the dossier isn\u2019t even what initiated the Russia investigation in the first place.\n\nMcCain represented a small but influential bloc in the GOP that has forcefully stood up for the rule of law by defending the investigation and law enforcement against Trump\u2019s attacks on them. (This is true even if you disagree with the anti-Russia views that partly drove McCain\u2019s stance.) In targeting McCain over this, Trump is just reprising the lies and degradation of our institutions that are designed to help him evade accountability for his own elite corruption, the true dimensions of which we are only beginning to learn about from the investigation and its spinoffs. This is honoring his promise to voters?\n\nAs for the idea that in attacking McCain, Trump is targeting GOP elites who oppose his nativism, it\u2019s true that McCain has called out Trump\u2019s xenophobic ethno-nationalism. Here his attacks on McCain do highlight an area where Trump really has tried to fulfill his promises. But his anti-immigrant hate agenda is pretty much all that\u2019s left of Trump\u2019s supposed economic nationalism. This is supposed to thrill his voters? What does that say about them?\n\nIn all these ways, the very idea that attacks on McCain fulfill his promise to his voters embodies the multifaceted scam festering at the core of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 dragged to absolute rock bottom.\n\nBut his voters will love it!\n\nRead more:\n\nJoseph I.
