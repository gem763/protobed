This is pretty new for me. I was a nervous, fearful kid who grew up as a teen in a religious home, so I spent my entire youth avoiding horror either by choice or by compulsion. As an adult, I\u2019ve started to delve into horror, to wrestle with its ideas and the fears of my younger self \u2014 watching movies and playing games both new and old, reflecting on what scared me then and what scares me now.\n\nOne of the first games to scare me wasn\u2019t even a horror game at all. It was Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin, a 1991 Sega Genesis game that had Spider-Man, framed for planting a bomb in New York City, on a mission to hunt down some of his most famous villains in order to get the keys necessary to disarm the bomb.\n\nUnlike a lot of superhero games of the \u201890s, Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin wasn\u2019t a loud beat-em-up or a colourful platformer \u2014 it was moody, and dedicated to being as faithful an adaptation as a 16-bit video game could be.\n\nCharacter models were remarkably detailed, and illustrated stills that were shown between levels strove for comic book fidelity. It\u2019s soundtrack was spare and brooding, and its animations had real weight.\n\nI loved the game, because I loved Spider-Man. But I could never get past the second level, down in the sewers, because I was terrified of the Lizard, and always shut the console off when he appeared.\n\nLooking back, the Lizard isn\u2019t that fearsome-looking \u2014 the character model for Doctor Octopus is far more imposing \u2014 but it worked. I quit every time. I would quit even faster when I tried to play the game on Nightmare difficulty. That added Venom to the first stage, which scared me even more.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that I kept trying to play this game when there were only about 15 minutes tops I could spend actually enjoying it. I suppose I wanted to try, if only for a little bit, to be as brave as I thought I had to be in order to be a hero, hoping maybe one day that I would wake up and somehow discover that courage grew in me overnight.\n\nI don\u2019t frighten like I used to, but that chill I felt when I pushed myself to take on something I knew would scare me, the chill that I always succumbed to because I wasn\u2019t as brave as I wanted to be? I\u2019m always afraid it\u2019ll come back.", "description": "Like a lot of people around this time of year, I spend a lot of October thinking about being frightened. This is pretty new for me.
