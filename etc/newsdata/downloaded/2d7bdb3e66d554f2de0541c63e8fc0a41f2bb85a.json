But also you can maybe not be totally in favour of it. Because there are things lacking,\u201d one European diplomat said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s hardly anything in there that describes the disembarkation, the disembarkation procedure and the relocation scheme afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Empty the boats\u2019 \u2013\n\nSome EU states grumbled that the Malta declaration does little to address migration flows to Spain or Greece which are largely not subject to sea search-and-rescue.\n\nSince the start of this year, 13 percent of irregular migrants have arrived in Europe through Italy or Malta, compared to 57 percent in Greece and 29 percent in Spain.\n\nSeveral states acknowledge however that the scheme seeks to \u201cempty the boats\u201d and alleviate a situation in which rescued migrants might spend weeks at sea before a European port allows an NGO ship to finally dock and have them disembark.\n\nThe European Commission sees the declaration as \u201cthe outline of a future agreement,\u201d according to a spokeswoman.\n\nNGOs such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch called it a \u201cpositive step\u201d, while Oxfam said it was \u201cthe first moment of hope for a more humane system since European migration policies deteriorated in 2015\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No idea\u2019 what support \u2013\n\nBut not all EU states are on board.\n\nWhile Luxembourg and Ireland are \u201chighly probable\u201d candidates to join the temporary scheme, Finland was in favour only if a critical mass of member states signed up, and the Netherlands was against, according to various EU diplomats.\n\nAsked how many might support the scheme in Tuesday\u2019s meeting, one diplomat told AFP: \u201cI have no idea. Your guess is as good as mine.\u201d\n\nAny suggestion that EU countries opposed to taking in migrants, such as Hungary or Poland, might be penalised through reduced EU spending or enforced contributions to those countries that do host could sour the meeting quickly.\n\nAnother diplomat cautioned that \u201cwe\u2019re still in a relatively early stage \u2014 this is a process which will certainly continue after Tuesday\u201d.", "description": "Luxembourg (AFP) \u2013 EU powers France, Germany and Italy, along with smaller member Malta, will on Tuesday seek to rally the rest of the European bloc", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/2bf1f6_migration-remains-hot-button-in-eu-numbers-irregular-arrivals-has-dropped-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
