She could go on much longer discussing the scouting report for the Las Vegas Aces, she said. That\u2019s where her head was at.\n\nSo she and her teammates put that to good use.\n\nThe Washington Mystics used a big third quarter to separate themselves from the Aces and held on to win, 103-91, in Game 2 of the WNBA semifinals Thursday at Entertainment and Sports Arena. The Mystics go for the sweep Sunday in Game 3 in Las Vegas.\n\nFor the second straight game, Emma Meesseman led all scorers with 30 points, one of six Mystics to score in double figures. Natasha Cloud posted 18 points and 11 assists, and LaToya Sanders scored 17.\n\nWith 14 points, Delle Donne had a modest scoring night, but was able to make it a double-double with 10 rebounds. Coach Mike Thibault said after the game that he drew up some plays in the second half to use the MVP as a decoy, knowing the Aces would still double her.\n\nLiz Cambage led Las Vegas with 23 points and 10 boards.\n\nMeesseman is shooting 62.2% (23-for-37) for the series so far, everything the Mystics could have hoped she would add and then some. She went 5-for-7 from the arc Thursday. The Belgian used to have a reputation for being too shy to shoot, but no longer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to take my shot when it goes in,\u201d Meesseman deadpanned.\n\nThe Aces played a sloppy first quarter, with Washington forcing them into five turnovers and tipping some other passes out of bounds. Cloud scored a fast 10 points on perfect shooting from the field (3-for-3) and the free throw line (4-for-4).\n\nA wide-open Delle Donne shot from the corner gave the Mystics their first double-digit lead of the night a few minutes into the second quarter, and they did a solid job of maintaining the edge for a while. But after a Meesseman bucket-and-foul put the Mystics up 11, they failed to score for the final 2:40 of the half.\n\nThe Aces scored the final 10 points of the half to go into halftime only down 50-49, and stretched the run to 14-0 in the third quarter before the Mystics finally interrupted it. The Mystics still had their struggles in transition, as in Game 1, when the Aces would cross-match to open up a scoring lane on fast breaks.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Aces went into halftime with the momentum. For the second straight game, the Mystics held steadfast and didn\u2019t collapse in a high-stakes atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no ranting and raving and any of that at halftime in these games,\u201d Mystics coach Mike Thibault said. \u201cThere\u2019s no fiery pep talk. Everybody wants to know, \u2018What\u2019d you say to them?\u2019 I say \u2018Well, we need to do this and watch this,\u2019 and that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s how we go about our business.\u201d\n\nWashington reestablished itself in the third quarter by outscoring Las Vegas 30-20. Meesseman drained three 3-pointers from all around the arc to lead the way. The forward also dished a nice assist to Sanders while driving the basket.\n\n\u201cI just take what the defense gives me,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI keep telling everybody, my job is probably easiest on the team because when they\u2019re doubling Elena or Emma, my job is basically to hit wide-open jumpers and lay-ups. I\u2019m pretty sure I can do those two things.\u201d\n\nThe Aces drew within eight with more fast breaks and some Tamera Young jumpers, but soon it was time for the Mystics to ice it. Meesseman pulled up to make her fifth long ball of the night and Kristi Toliver followed it up with a long jumper to get the Mystics to 100.\n\nDown 0-2, the Aces don\u2019t feel they\u2019re out of the series.\n\n\u201cWashington did what they were supposed to do: win their home games,\u201d coach Bill Laimbeer said. \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn to go back to Las Vegas and we\u2019ve been talking about our home situation, how much we like it. Now it\u2019s our turn to go and hold our home court and come back here and go at it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t done. It\u2019s just getting started,\u201d Cambage said.\n\nLas Vegas would host a Game 4 Tuesday if necessary, while Game 5 would be played back in the District next Thursday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
