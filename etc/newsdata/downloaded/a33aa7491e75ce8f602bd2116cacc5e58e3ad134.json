One caller asked about Qualcomm ( QCOM ) : \"I like Qualcomm. Good yield and buyback,\" noted Cramer.\n\nIn this updated daily bar chart of QCOM, below, we can see that prices have made a bit of a \"wild ride\" since early February. After a sharp run up in April and a quick and deep correction, prices have been trying to work higher. We do have a higher low in August but the highs in July and September have been roughly equal. This could be a rising or ascending triangle pattern.\n\nPrices are currently testing the rising 50-day moving average line. The 200-day average is rising too. The trading volume has been light and shrinking the past few months and this fits with a triangle pattern.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been moving sideways too and has yet to show us aggressive buying. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is just above the zero line and could tip up or down in the days ahead.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of QCOM, below, we can see a larger triangle pattern from April. Price is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bullish and much more constructive than the daily line. The MACD oscillator is ready for its next move.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of QCOM, below, we can see that a downside price target of $71 is being projected but a trade at $80.63 will likely refresh the uptrend.\n\nBottom line strategy: Back in 1910 when traders noticed patterns like triangles they also noticed that the tend to break out 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through the pattern. If QCOM is going to make a breakout it needs to get going. Go long above $81.", "description": "Let's check on the charts and indicators to get some trading parameters....QCOM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Qualcomm Needs To Break Out Soon If There'S A Triangle Pattern", "Let'S Check On The Charts", "Indicators To Get Some Trading Parameters.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/9a741cb7-6cd7-11e9-b5b3-c92dde783521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
