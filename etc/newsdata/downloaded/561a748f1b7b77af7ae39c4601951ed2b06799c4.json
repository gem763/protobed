A euro bought $1.0951 at 0105 GMT. The dollar hovered near a three-week high against the Australian dollar, which bought $0.6749 AUD=D3 .\n\n\"It's a pretty decent move really,\" said Nick Twidale co-founder of Sydney-based trade finance provider Xchainge, who said it was driven by optimism for a U.S.-China trade deal and markets' shifting the prospect of impeachment to the long-term.\n\n\"Markets shrug these things off very, very quickly and we move on to the next stuff. As it moves on, it's going to be interesting, but we have to go back to the fundamentals and fundamentals are going to push the dollar higher over time.\"\n\nSterling GBP=D3 nursed losses at $1.2359, after dropping more than 1% overnight as investors priced in many more months of Brexit and election risk. greenback had been sold when U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-led chamber was launching an impeachment inquiry over Trump's handling of a call to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. summary of the call subsequently released by the administration showed Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden - Trump's leading Democratic rival - but did not show Trump threatening to withhold aid. House inquiry could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office, though that is seen as unlikely to succeed because Republicans control the Senate.\n\nTrump also on Wednesday stoked hopes for a trade deal by telling reporters in New York that the U.S. and China were having \"good conversations\" and that an agreement \"could happen sooner than you think\". was enough to turn the risk tide,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney of the president's comments.\n\nIt set trade-exposed risk currencies such as the New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 and the drifting higher, though the strong dollar capped gains to below 0.1%.\n\nSigns of a rebound in the U.S. housing market on Wednesday, when data showed August sales of new single-family homes rose more than expected, further buttressed the dollar. Few market-moving data releases are scheduled on Thursday.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar held around 98.959, just below a two-week peak. The safe-haven yen steadied at 107.71 per dollar.\n\nThe Chinese yuan was flat in offshore trade at 7.1278 after falling 0.3% overnight.
