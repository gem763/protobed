I think the original perpetrators didn\u2019t expect probably that sort of impact,\u201d she added.\n\nThe WannaCry cyberattack was the first major global security incident in years. Hackers believed to be associated with North Korea used a set of highly classified hacking tools that only weeks earlier had been stolen from the National Security Agency and published online. The tools allowed anyone who used them to infect thousands of vulnerable computers with a backdoor. That backdoor was used to deliver the WannaCry payload, which locked out users from their own files unless they paid a ransom.\n\nMaking matters worse, WannaCry had wormable properties, allowing it to spread across a network and making it difficult to contain.\n\nAlthough the National Security Agency never publicly acknowledged the theft of its hacking tools, Homeland Security said at the time that users were \u201cthe first line of defense\u201d against the threat of WannaCry. Microsoft released security fixes weeks earlier, but many had not installed the patches.\n\n\u201cUpdating your patches would have prevented a fair amount of people from from being a victim,\u201d said Manfra. Yet data shows that two years after the attacks, more than a million computers remained vulnerable to the ransomware.\n\nManfra said \u201cbad things are going to happen,\u201d but that efforts to mobilize government and the private sector can help combat cyberattacks as they emerge.\n\n\u201cLuckily, there was a an enterprising individual who was able to find a way to kill it and it didn\u2019t impact the U.S. as much,\u201d she said.\n\nMarcus Hutchins, a malware reverse engineer and security researcher, registered a domain name found the ransomware\u2019s code which when registered acted as a \u201ckill switch,\u201d stopping the ransomware from spreading. Hutchins was hailed as an \u201caccidental hero\u201d for his efforts. Hutchins and his colleague Jamie Hankins spent a week ensuring the kill switch stayed up, helping to prevent millions of further infections.\n\nManfra\u2019s remarks came just weeks after her department warned of a new, emerging threat posed by BlueKeep, a vulnerability found in Windows 7 and earlier, which experts say has the capacity to trigger another global incident similar to the WannaCry attack. BlueKeep can be exploited to run malicious code \u2014 such as malware or ransomware \u2014 on an affected system.\n\nLike WannaCry, BlueKeep also has wormable properties, allowing it to spread to other vulnerable computers on the same network.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that a million internet-connected devices are vulnerable to BlueKeep. Security researchers say it is only a matter of time before bad actors develop and use a BlueKeep exploit to carry out a similar WannaCry-style cyberattack.", "description": "The U.S. government may not be able to prevent another global cyberattack like WannaCry, a senior cybersecurity official has said.
