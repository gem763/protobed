The Australian government is taking the lead on both cases.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Affairs Department confirmed the arrests but declined to provide details about the cases, citing privacy concerns.\n\n\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to the families of three Australians detained in Iran. Due to our privacy obligations, we will not comment further,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nDFAT on Monday updated its travel advice for Iran. It remains at a level of 'reconsider your need to travel', with the highest level ('Do not travel') applying in some parts of the country.\n\nThe blogger and her boyfriend had been documenting their travels on YouTube and Instagram.\n\nConcerns were raised by their online followers when they failed to add any news posts in the past several weeks.\n\nTulip Siddiq, who is Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s Labour MP, told The Times: \u201cThis terrible news shows a clear escalation of Iran\u2019s hostage diplomacy. Soft diplomatic responses to Iran\u2019s illegal and inhumane treatment of British prisoners have been a failure.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Office declined to comment. It states on its website: \u201cThere is a risk that British nationals, and a higher risk that British-Iranian dual nationals, could be arbitrarily detained in Iran. All British nationals should consider carefully the risks of travelling to Iran.\u201d\n\nThe news came as Britain accused accused Tehran of an \"unacceptable\" breach of international norms after it apparently broke a promise that an oil tanker detained off Gibraltar this summer would not deliver oil to Syria.\n\nDominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, summoned the Iranian ambassador on Tuesday afternoon following reports that the Adrian Darya 1, which was at the centre of a diplomatic crisis after being seized by Royal Marines in July, had delivered a cargo of crude oil to the Syrian port of Tartus.\n\nBritain says Iran repeatedly gave assurances that the ship would not deliver oil to any EU-sanctioned entity in Syria or elsewhere before it was released last month.\n\nMr Raab said: \u201cIran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over Adrian Darya 1.\n\n\u201cThis sale of oil to Assad\u2019s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the Government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security. This includes illegally supplying weapons to Houthi insurgents in Yemen, support for Hezbollah terrorists and most recently its attempts to hijack commercial ships passing through the Gulf.\n\n\u201cWe want Iran to come in from the cold but the only way to do that is to keep its word and comply with the rules-based international system.\u201d\n\nThe Adrian Darya 1, known as the Grace 1 until it was renamed by its owners last month, was seized by Gibraltar authorities and Royal Marine Commandos acting on intelligence that it was bound for Syria on July 4.\n\nBritain and Gibraltar said the move was to enforce European Union sanctions that forbid the supply of oil to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator.\n\nIt was released in August after a court in Gibraltar accepted assurances that the vessel would not breach the sanctions, and rejected a last-minute US bid to have it impounded.\n\nBut the vessel spent several days meandering near the Syrian coast and turned off its transponder before apparently making its delivery last week.", "description": "Two British-Australian women have reportedly been arrested and detained in Iran amid growing tensions between London and Tehran.\u00a0 One of the women, a blogger who was travelling through Asia with her Australian boyfriend, was arrested 10 weeks ago on charges which remain unclear, according to The Times", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vGSMYzrek1sJXWpeXqJWWw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/fc2746c6f06f95e630fcdcc00902780f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
