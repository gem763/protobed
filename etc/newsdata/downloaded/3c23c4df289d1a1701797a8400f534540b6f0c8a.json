Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nA high yield and a long history of paying dividends is an appealing combination for Victrex. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Victrex for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nLSE:VCT Historical Dividend Yield, October 17th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company's dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 52% of Victrex's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Victrex paid out 67% of its free cash flow last year, which is acceptable, but is starting to limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested into the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nWith a strong net cash balance, Victrex investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.\n\nWe update our data on Victrex every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Victrex's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was UK\u00a30.18 in 2009, compared to UK\u00a31.42 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 23% a year over that time.\n\nWith rapid dividend growth and no notable cuts to the dividend over a lengthy period of time, we think this company has a lot going for it.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Earnings have grown at around 6.0% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! The rate at which earnings have grown is quite decent, and by paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends, the company is striking a reasonable balance between reinvestment and returns to shareholders.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Victrex plc (LON:VCT) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
