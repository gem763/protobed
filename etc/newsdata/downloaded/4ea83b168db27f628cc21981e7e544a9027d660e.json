(AP) \u2014 The upcoming trial of a Chinese national on federal charges that she trespassed at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and lied to the Secret Service is potentially a circus wrapped in mystery.\n\nRejecting the strong recommendation of U.S. District Judge Roy Altman, Yujing Zhang in June to act as her own attorney - a longshot move the 33-year-old Shanghai business consultant has struggled with during pretrial hearings setting up Monday's scheduled jury selection.\n\nZhang often frustrates Altman by ignoring his questions or answering with non sequiturs. At times she replies in near-fluent English and insists she understands complex legal concepts, but will then say she doesn't understand a simple question and turns to her Mandarin translator.\n\n\"I know full well that you understand what I am saying to you both in English and in Mandarin,\" Altman told her during an August hearing. \"You are trying to play games.\"\n\nIf that weren't enough, prosecutors have filed under seal secret evidence that they say has national security implications, even though Zhang is not charged with espionage. The Secret Service said when agents detained Zhang at Mar-a-Lago she was carrying a computer, a hard drive, four cellphones and a thumb drive containing malware, although agents later recanted that accusation.\n\nAgents said Zhang told them she brought the electronics to Mar-a-Lago because she feared they would be stolen if left at her nearby hotel, but in her room they allegedly found a device to detect hidden cameras, computers, $8,000 in cash plus credit and debit cards, all in the open.\n\nMar-a-Lago.

The U.S. attorney's office in Miami declined comment. Zhang could get six years if convicted.\n\nHer former public defenders are on standby in case she changes her mind about representing herself. They have said she appears mentally competent, but she wouldn't speak to a psychologist. They said Zhang's Chinese relatives told them she has no mental health problems.\n\nRead more: Chinese woman accused of Mar-a-Lago trespass angers judge\n\nZhang was arrested March 30 after she allegedly lied to get past a Secret Service agent guarding Mar-a-Lago, saying she was there to use the pool. She made it to the lobby where she told a receptionist she was there for a United Nations friendship event that night and had come early to take pictures. That event had been canceled and prosecutors say Zhang had been informed. The president was staying at Mar-a-Lago that weekend but was at his nearby golf club when Zhang arrived.\n\nWhile there are no statistics, it is rare for defendants charged with serious felonies to represent themselves \u2014 go \"pro se\" in legal parlance \u2014 and that's particularly true in federal court. Even with an experienced defense attorney, federal acquittals are rare. 90% of federal defendants pleaded guilty in 2018 and 8% had their cases dismissed. Of the 2% who went to trial, eight out of 10 were convicted.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump participates in a Christmas Eve video teleconference with members of the military at Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., December 24, 2017. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nUniversity of Florida law professor Michelle Jacobs, a former criminal defense lawyer, and Miami attorney David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said Altman's job will be more difficult because Zhang doesn't know trial procedure or rules. If she makes a major error that slips by, that could lead to a guilty verdict being thrown out on appeal. Altman will likely slow the trial so Zhang can keep up.\n\nWeinstein said prosecutors will find the case more difficult because not only do they also have to watch out for reversible errors Zhang might make, their \"vanity\" is at stake.\n\n\"It is one thing to lose to a defense attorney; it is quite another to lose a case to a pro se defendant,\" he said.\n\nJacobs wondered if Zhang fired her public defenders because she comes from an authoritarian country and thought their job was to help ensure her conviction, even though Altman explained their role numerous times.\n\n\"The expectation might be that the state will do what the state does and whether you participate or not,\" Jacobs said, \"the end of the trial is a foregone conclusion.\"", "description": "The trial of a Chinese national on charges that she trespassed at Mar-a-Lago and lied to Secret Service is potentially a circus wrapped in mystery.", "authors": ["Terry Spencer", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7401332e22af4a584925d4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
