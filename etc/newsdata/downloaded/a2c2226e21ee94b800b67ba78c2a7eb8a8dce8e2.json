Now, Jacob argues, it\u2019s not just time to contain it; it\u2019s time to control it.\n\nAlma and Jacob spend much of \u201cMoving the Keys\u201d on the challenge that gives the episode its title: If Alma can move the keys on the counter with her mind, she passes. Or, more accurately: Alma needs to \u201cwillfully break free of linear time, and then move in time to a time when the keys aren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nIt looks like a boring and unpleasant process \u2014 but by the end of the episode, Alma\u2019s grip on her superpower has improved. When she cuts herself while chopping vegetables, she discovers she can rewind time so it never happened. And when she tests the limit of her rewind ability, she ends up in the car on the way home from Becca\u2019s engagement dinner (and finally realizes that she broke up with Sam before the accident).\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Sam, because \u201cMoving the Keys\u201d is the first time Jacob seems to give his daughter\u2019s live-in boyfriend any thought at all. When he sneers at Sam\u2019s pet name for Alma, it\u2019s a strange enough little blip that it made me start to think about the questions Alma hasn\u2019t really been contemplating about Jacob. It\u2019s easy enough to understand why Jacob is so fascinated in the circumstances surrounding his own death, and why he\u2019s so desperate to have that death reversed. But isn\u2019t it a little weird that, since his sudden reemergence, he hasn\u2019t expressed any interest whatsoever in Alma\u2019s life? Or asked any questions about Becca\u2019s upcoming wedding? Or checked in, even for a moment, on the widowed wife he keeps saying he loved so much?\n\nWe\u2019re halfway through the season, and that\u2019s as good a time as any to put some cards on the table. So here\u2019s my take: Whatever the truth about his death, Jacob is a seriously bad dude, manipulating his daughter in any way that might suit his purpose. (Kudos to Undone for casting Bob Odenkirk, with all his innate charm and likability, and weaponizing it against the audience.)\n\nSo what does that mean for the show? Jacob believes his death was a grand conspiracy \u2014 maybe orchestrated by Charlie Vanderhorn of the sinister American Freedom Corporation, or by someone seeking revenge for Jacob\u2019s potentially world-altering ideas. Alma suspects it might have been the boyfriend of Farnaz, the graduate student on whom Jacob had an obvious (and potentially requited) crush. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say Alma\u2019s answer is closer to the truth.\n\nAnd in a different category entirely, there\u2019s the problem that Jacob\u2019s advice for how Alma should navigate her superpower \u2014 while practical, perhaps, for someone who needs to figure out how to hop around in time \u2014 is also terrible advice for living a fulfilling human life. \u201cLet your feelings pass through you like weather,\u201d he suggests. Which is another way of saying that Jacob believes Alma shouldn\u2019t take any time to process her feelings, or to dissect why she might be having them, or what to do about it. He even suggests that she needs to let her good feelings go.\n\nDoes that sound like a loving parent to you? Camila has her flaws, but at the very least, she\u2019s actually concerned about Alma\u2019s wellbeing. And it\u2019s her prodding that finally gets Alma into a psychiatrist\u2019s office. When Alma sits down with the psychiatrist, she doesn\u2019t talk about zipping through different realities or times. She talks about the parts of the human condition in 2019 that anybody, but particularly adults of her generation, can understand. \u201cEvery part of our natural lives have been commodified, taken from us and then sold right back to us,\u201d she fumes.\n\nIn other words: Alma\u2019s problems are a lot more complicated now that she has a secret superpower, but she had plenty of problems before the accident too \u2014 and if she\u2019s ever going to move forward, she needs to figure out how to deal with all of them.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 Sam and Becca, who are each armed with compromising information on the other, cut a devil\u2019s bargain: If Sam won\u2019t tell anyone Becca had a one-night stand with the bartender at the Alexander Street Bar, Becca won\u2019t tell Alma that she broke up with Sam and then forgot about it after the accident. Those certainly sound like the kind of secrets that will come back to haunt both of them before the season comes to an end.\n\n\u2022 Alma discovers an obituary for Farnaz that reveals, among other things, that she was survived by three brothers. I wonder if any of them will come into play.\n\n\u2022 During Alma\u2019s training, there\u2019s a brief flash of her grandmother Geraldine, who allegedly possessed the same powers. Alma even traces the timeline back to Geraldine, as a young immigrant, disembarking from the ship that brought her to the United States.\n\n\u2022 Stumbling across a dumb-looking reenactment of the Battle of the Alamo is enough to spark a long (and essentially accurate) rant from Alma about how the \u201cheroes\u201d of the Alamo were fighting for their right to keep slaves.\n\n\u2022 In an unsuccessful attempt to bond with Alma, Becca\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Reed Hollingsworth offers a goofy, oddly touching anecdote about how he likes to Google pictures of birds when he\u2019s at work and think about how their strong hearts are what enable them to life.\n\n\u2022 Is it just a coincidence that Alma\u2019s attempt to move the keys goes hand-in-hand with Sam tapping the keys of their piano?\n\n\u2022 Camila also thinks that the pictures in the hallway are out of order.
