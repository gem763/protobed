His wife, Jennifer Robertson, has been dealing with the firm\u2019s fallout ever since through a court-appointed creditor protection and bankruptcy process.\n\nAfter Cotten\u2019s death, Robertson said she \u201cmade every effort to assist in the recovery of the QuadrigaCX assets for the benefit of affected users,\u201d she said Monday in an e-mailed statement provided by her lawyer. Since the proceedings began, Robertson said she\u2019s been \u201cresponsive, helpful and cooperative\u201d with the court-appointed monitor and trustee in the search for and recovery of cryptocurrency and other assets.\n\n\u201cI have now entered into a voluntary settlement agreement where the vast majority of my assets and all of the estate\u2019s assets are being returned to QCX to benefit the affected users,\u201d she said. \u201cThese assets originally came from QCX at the direction of Gerry.\u201d\n\nAssets excluded from the settlement include $90,000 cash, about $20,000 in her registered retirement savings plan, a 2015 Jeep Cherokee, her wedding band and other jewelry, $15,000 in personal furnishings and Quadriga shares, according to an Ontario court filing submitted Monday by the bankruptcy trustee. Assets surrendered were valued at approximately $12 million and would \u201cmaterially improve the expected distributions to Quadriga shareholders,\u201d the trustee said.\n\nThe trustee\u2019s report identified several examples of property transferred from Quadriga to fund the purchases of personal assets for Cotten and his wife, including funds Robertson received and subsequently lent to Robertson Nova Property Management Inc. to buy real estate. Third-party payment processors were on various occasions instructed by Cotten to distribute \u201csignificant\u201d amounts of fund directly to himself, Roberts or related companies. Most of the transfers and subsequent personal purchases with funds originating from Quadriga happened within the three years of the firm entered creditor protection.\n\nWhen Cotten died, the couple owned \u201csignificant\u201d cash holdings, 16 properties in Nova Scotia, real estate in British Columbia, vehicles, a sailing vessel and a personal aircraft. In addition, the couple \u201cincurred significant personal, living and travel-related expenses,\u201d the report said.\n\nRobertson reiterated that she didn\u2019t know about Cotten\u2019s dealings at the firm.\n\n\u201cI had no direct knowledge of how Gerry operated the business prior to his death, and was not aware of his improper actions in managing the QuadrigaCX business as outlined by the monitor in its 5th report in June,\u201d she said. \u201cSpecifically, I was not aware of nor participated in Gerry\u2019s trading activities, nor his appropriation of the affected user\u2019s funds.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the investigations, Robertson said she agreed to return assets she had previously thought were purchased with Cotten\u2019s \u201clegitimately earned profits, salary and dividends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was upset and disappointed with Gerry\u2019s activities as uncovered by the investigation when I first learned of them, and continue to be,\u201d she said.\n\nRobertson called the settlement \u201ca fair and equitable resolution\u201d for Quadriga and its affected users, while allowing the trustee to continue efforts to recover as much as possible in an efficient way while keeping legal fees as low as possible.\n\n\u201cIn return, this settlement will allow me to move on with the next chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Jennifer Robertson says she's returning the 'vast majority' of her assets and all the estate's assets to Quadriga to benefit 'affected users'", "authors": ["Doug Alexander", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bitcoin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
