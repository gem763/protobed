Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Testifying in defiance of President Donald Trump's ban, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators Friday that Trump himself had pressured the State Department to oust her from her post and get her out of the country.\n\nYovanovitch told lawmakers investigating Trump's dealings with Ukraine that there was a \"concerted campaign\" against her based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\"\n\nThe diplomat was recalled from Kyiv as Rudy Giuliani \u2014 who is Trump's personal attorney and has no official role in the U.S. government \u2014 pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was involved with a gas company there.\n\nYovanovitch testified behind closed doors Friday for more than nine hours as part of the House Democrats' impeachment investigation. Her prepared remarks were obtained by The Associated Press. She left without answering questions.\n\nNew York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, said Yovanovitch occasionally had to leave the room because she was overcome with emotion as she was \"recounting how she was thrown to the wolves\" in Ukraine.\n\n\"It is clear to me that she was fired because she was a thorn in the side of those who sought to use the Ukrainian government for their own political and financial gain - and that includes President Trump,\" Maloney said.\n\nLawmakers leaving the meeting would not provide specifics from the confidential deposition. But they indicated that Yovanovitch was providing information that would help with the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"It was compelling, it was impactful, it was powerful and I just feel grateful for the opportunity to have received that information,\" said Democratic Rep. Denny Heck, who flew in from Washington state for the interview. He said the eight hours he was there \"went like a New York second.\"\n\nYovanovitch \"set a very powerful, courageous example,\" said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey.\n\nRepublicans leaving the meeting focused their criticism on Democrats, arguing that the president's lawyers should be able to attend the hearings and cross examine witnesses. \"This process is a joke, and the consequences are huge,\" said New York Rep. Lee Zeldin.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio defended Yovanovitch's removal from Ukraine, saying the president is entitled to have the ambassador he wants.\n\nThe former ambassador said she was fired from her post after insisting that Giuliani's requests to Ukrainian officials for investigations be relayed through official channels, according to a former diplomat who has spoken with her. That former diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversation.\n\nTrump, in a July 25 phone call, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Yovanovitch was \"bad news,\" according to a partial transcript released by the White House. Neither Giuliani nor Trump has publicly specified their objections to her.\n\nShe said in her statement Friday that she was abruptly told this spring to depart Ukraine \"on the next plane.\" She left her post in May and was later told the president had lost confidence in her and had been pressuring State Department officials for many months to remove her, she said.\n\nDemocrats leading the investigation said they subpoenaed Yovanovitch on Friday morning after learning late Thursday night that the State Department had directed her not to appear. Trump has forbidden all government employees to cooperate, and Yovanovitch remains employed by the State Department. She is doing a fellowship at Georgetown University.\n\nHer testimony in the face of Trump's opposition won't be the last as the congressional panels hold a flurry of depositions to investigate the president's efforts to jump-start foreign investigations that could help his 2020 reelection campaign. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she wants the committees to move \"expeditiously\" as they decide whether to move forward with a formal impeachment vote.\n\nPolls show the nation now generally split as to whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office.\n\nOn Monday, Fiona Hill, a former White House adviser who focused on Russia, is expected to appear, and three current State Department officials are tentatively scheduled next week. They include Gordon Sondland, who was blocked from appearing this week but whose attorney said he would testify next Thursday.", "description": "Testifying in defiance of President Donald Trump's ban, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators Friday that Trump himself had pressured the State Department to oust her from her post and get her out of the country.
