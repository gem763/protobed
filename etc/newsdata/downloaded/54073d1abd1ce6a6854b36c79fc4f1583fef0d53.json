They believe that three died after jumping in to rescue a worker who had been emptying the tank.\n\nTwo owned the farm and two were employees. All were Indian citizens. The two brothers Prem and Tarsem Singh registered their farm in 2017.\n\nIt is about 45km (28 miles) from Milan.\n\nItalian media report that the Singhs' farm at Arena Po, producing milk and veal cattle, is one of the biggest in the Pavia region.\n\nThe victims were named as: Prem and Tarsem Singh, aged 48 and 45 respectively, Arminder Singh (29) and Majinder Singh (28).\n\nThe manure was being collected for use as fertiliser on the farm's fields.\n\nRead similar stories:\n\nThe victims' wives raised the alarm when the men failed to turn up for lunch on Thursday. They rushed to the scene and spotted one body in the sewage.\n\nThe wives then called in firefighters, who donned masks and emptied the tank to recover all the bodies.\n\nItaly's public broadcaster Rai says the Arena Po tragedy brings to 486 the total of deaths in work accidents in Italy this year - the highest toll since 2016.\n\nThe new agriculture minister, Teresa Bellanova, tweeted condolences and said \"safety at work is an inalienable right and we must make every effort to ensure it is respected\".
