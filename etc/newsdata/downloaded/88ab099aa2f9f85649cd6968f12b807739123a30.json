Woods finished off a final-round 3-under 67 at the weather-delayed Zozo Championship. Here\u2019s how things played out at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club:\n\nLeaderboard: Woods (-19), Hideki Matsuyama (-16), Rory McIlroy (-13), Sungjae Im (-13), Gary Woodland (-12), Billy Horschel (-11), Corey Conners (-11)\n\nWhat it means: In the first start of his 24th season, Woods has officially won as many Tour events as any man who has ever lived. What long seemed a formality became reality at an inaugural event contested 5,500 miles from where Woods captured win No. 1 in Las Vegas. Woods won\u2019t play another Tour event in 2019. If he tees it up at his traditional yearly lid-lifter, the Farmers Insurance Open in late-January, Woods will vie for win No. 83 at the site of seven of his Tour titles.\n\nRound of the day: Woods only played seven holes on Monday, and didn\u2019t play those very well \u2013 at least to start. He bogeyed his first hole upon the resumption of play and missed an 8-foot birdie putt on his second (No. 13). But a birdie at the par-5 14th re-upped his advantage to three strokes and that was that. Woods parred Nos. 15-17 and closed with a birdie at the par-5 18th. As he has done now 82 times on Tour, Woods did everything that was necessary in order to win.\n\nZozo Championship: Full-field scores | Full coverage\n\nBest of the rest: There was only one storyline of significance in the final round, but Im will quietly leave Japan a happy man. Last season\u2019s Rookie of the Year closed in 65 to tie for third. It\u2019s his second top-3 finish in six starts to the new wraparound campaign.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Matsuyama birdied his final two holes Sunday night, prior to the stoppage of play, to cut his deficit to three strokes. After Woods\u2019 sluggish start Monday morning, the local favorite had this 5-foot putt for birdie at the 14th to get within one. He missed.\n\nMoments later, Woods birdied the same hole and Matsuyama\u2019s fate was sealed. While that short miss was a disappointment, Matsuyama was not. He was the perfect supporting act for the Japanese faithful this week. He shot no worse than 67 over four rounds, but, like so many before him, he couldn't apply enough pressure on Woods when it mattered most.\n\nQuote of the day: \u201cI know how it feels to have this game taken away from you, where I couldn\u2019t participate the way I wanted to. I\u2019m just so happy and so fortunate to have this opportunity again.\u201d - Tiger Woods\n\nShot of the day: Watch as the person recording this video quickly pans to the left to show you where the hole ACTUALLY GOES. Then watch the line Bubba Watson takes \u2013 not just down another hole, but through the trees.\n\nFor the record, Bubba made a par-5 on the sixth, en route to a 5-over 75.", "description": "Tiger Woods captured his 82nd PGA Tour victory Monday in Japan, tying Sam Snead for the all-time PGA Tour wins record.", "authors": ["Tiger Tracker", "Rex Hoggard"], "top_image": "https://www.golfchannel.com/sites/default/files/2019/10/27/woods_1920_zozo19_d5_trophy_smile.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
