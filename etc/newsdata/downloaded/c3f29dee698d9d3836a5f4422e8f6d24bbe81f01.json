Over 150 million tonnes of plastic are in our oceans, according to a World Economic Forum paper from 2016, and a 2018 UK government report warned the amount of plastic polluting the world's oceans is expected to triple between 2015 and 2025.\n\nLike the Ice Bucket Challenge that raised $115 million for the ALS Association, #trashtag could be a rare social media challenge that makes the world a better place.\n\n\"If we all pick up a couple of things, we can all pitch in and make an impact,\" says Craig Frazee, UCO junior design engineer. \"This is a movement to inspire people to be better stewards of the environment.\"\n\n\"It's amazing that people are out their taking responsibility for the planet,\" said Rom\u00e1n. \"It's never too late to get started.\"", "description": "Viral internet challenge #trashtag has encouraged garbage cleanup.", "authors": ["Stephanie Bailey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190312153938-trashtag1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
