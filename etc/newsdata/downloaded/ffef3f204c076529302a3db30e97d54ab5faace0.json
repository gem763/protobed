His strongest pieces were the strength-based, upper-body disciplines of rings, parallel bars and high bar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m over the moon, it\u2019s unbelievable for me,\u201d said Fraser, who trains at the City of Birmingham club. He had fallen on the high bar in both Monday\u2019s qualifying and Wednesday\u2019s team final, but posted an excellent score of 14.000 this time.\n\nJames Hall also competed for Britain and finished 14th. He was particularly strong on the vault, which he nailed for a score of 14.633, but a fall from the high bar after a lengthy wait to perform cost him a mark. Had he made that catch, he too would probably have sneaked into the top 10, backing up the eighth place he claimed last year.\n\nStill, these championships continue to find British gymnastics in solid \u2013 though not world-beating \u2013 shape. With 21-year-old Giarnni Regini-Moran and 18-year-old Alice Kinsella also showing quality this week, the line of succession appears to be in good hands.", "description": "Great Britain\u2019s next generation of gymnasts continue to post solid results at the World Championships in Stuttgart, as 20-year-old Joe Fraser finished eighth in Friday\u2019s all-around final with a career-best score of 85.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212742909-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqTh3H5BemKyhXFKdcxJGxV1FTNNabxLt8zdWE99ykJoY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
