Kavanaugh defended her ability to set aside her personal beliefs and prior advocacy work during her confirmation hearing Wednesday, promising to be a fair and impartial federal district court judge.\n\nSarah E. Pitlyk, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Eastern District of Missouri, was peppered with questions about her Catholic faith and her defense of pro-life activists such as David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, who published videos in 2015 of Planned Parenthood officials appearing to negotiate the sale of aborted fetal body parts.\n\n\u201cI stand in a long line of other people who have sat at this table who have had history in advocacy, or in an issue-related advocacy, or in politics and who have become very distinguished jurists,\u201d Ms. Pitlyk told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocrats on the committee questioned whether Ms. Pitlyk would apply the 1973 Supreme Court precedent, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide, given her religious views and record as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been more than just an advocate for the anti-choice agenda. You filed a brief arguing that life begins at conception. You\u2019ve defended Iowa\u2019s abortion ban. You worked to defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Democrat.\n\nThe nominee graduated from Yale Law School in 2008 and currently works on constitutional and civil rights issues for the Thomas More Society, a conservative pro-life law firm.\n\nDespite Ms. Pitlyk\u2019s clerkship for Justice Kavanaugh when he sat on the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia and her work at several law firms prior to joining the Thomas More Society, the American Bar Association rated Ms. Pitlyk \u201cnot qualified,\u201d saying she doesn\u2019t have the requisite trial or litigation experience needed to sit on the federal bench.\n\n\u201cAs we go out to hire people to represent us to engage them to represent us, the first thing we look for is experience. You\u2019re asking for a lifetime appointment as a trial court judge. There are many things I think you would be excellent at, your background says that. This is not one of them,\u201d Sen. Richard Durbin, Illinois Democrat, told the nominee.\n\nBut Republican members on the committee said the ABA rating was biased, with Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, saying the group has been a \u201cpartisan mouthpiece\u201d for Democrats when it comes to rating the president\u2019s judicial nominees.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have continuously questioned the ABA\u2019s scoring of Trump-appointed judicial nominees after a circuit court pick in 2017 said he was quizzed about his opinion on abortion during the organization\u2019s evaluation process.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, said the \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating for Ms. Pitlyk reflects the organization\u2019s animus toward her judicial record defending pro-life causes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m troubled for what they have done,\u201d he told the nominee.\n\nThe American Bar Association did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLiberal advocacy groups, meanwhile, have opposed Ms. Pitlyk, saying she satisfies the president\u2019s litmus test he detailed during the 2016 campaign to appoint pro-life judges.\n\n\u201cWomen who walk into her courtroom cannot have confidence that Pitlyk will fairly and correctly apply critical Supreme Court precedents and enforce essential constitutional rights,\u201d Alliance for Justice noted on the group\u2019s website.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee on Wednesday also considered two other district court nominees and two federal appeals court picks, one for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the other for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
