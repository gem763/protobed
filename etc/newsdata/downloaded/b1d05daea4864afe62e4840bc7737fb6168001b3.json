Our new forecasts imply they are going to respond to content cost acceleration by revving up their own content spend that will allow them to maintain their subscriber growth while pushing back profitability materially. In the end our view is that very few players can (or will) keep up with these spend levels and that ultimately this will be a 2-horse race (NFLX and Disney) where both horses can win, with Amazon on the periphery and there is a reasonable shot that AT&T will screw up HBO as a competitor.\"", "description": "Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Tuesday", "authors": ["Michael Bloom"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106012578-1562794741761rtx6x3jw.jpg?v=1562794818", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
