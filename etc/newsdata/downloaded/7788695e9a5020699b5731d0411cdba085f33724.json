The 2-2 was a mentality problem?\u201d Reus told a Sky reporter. \u201cEvery week the same rubbish.\u201d\n\nDortmund coach Lucien Favre also rejected the notion on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say it\u2019s a question of mentality. I don\u2019t think Dortmund had won in Frankfurt for six years,\u201d Favre said. \u201cWe were close to a win because we played very well. We could have done better because we only scored two goals. Of course we can be annoyed about losing two points, (conceding a goal) two minutes before the end, it\u2019s a shame, but we have to look forward.\u201d\n\nFavre received support from sporting director Michael Zorc.\n\n\u201cMentality is blamed for a lot, especially when things are not going well,\u201d said Zorc.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still very early into the season. When I look at the (media) reports this week then I get the impression we\u2019re at the end, that we\u2019ve missed our targets and that we\u2019ve played a terrible season. It\u2019s all a bit too much for me,\u201d Zorc said.\n\nBut Dortmund\u2019s league challenge is in danger of faltering due to the same frailties that undermined its hopes last season. The side has already dropped five points from five games and it can ill afford many more slip-ups if it is to claim its first Bundesliga title since 2012.\n\nDortmund failed to exploit numerous chances to build on leads against Frankfurt and twice allowed the home side to get back in the game. The defense looked shaky without the injured Mats Hummels, who had been forced off injured after 63 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe had big opportunities to score more goals,\u201d Favre said. \u201cAt times we played very, very well, but at times our last pass and our second-last pass wasn\u2019t so good.\u201d\n\nIt was a similar story against Barcelona in the Champions League the previous Tuesday, when Dortmund dominated the second half but failed to convert chances into goals and had to be content with a 0-0 draw.\n\nFavre said the situation reminded him of February, when Dortmund went five games without a win and got knocked out of the German Cup by Werder Bremen. Also, Tottenham won 3-0 against Dortmund, on its way to knocking Favre\u2019s team out of the Champions League.\n\nDortmund frequently dominated last season without converting chances into goals and was then prone to conceding late in games as nerves took hold.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep going after scoring the first goal,\u201d said Favre, whose side failed to register a shot at goal in the last 15 minutes of the first half against Frankfurt, and was hanging on again at the end of the second.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t dominate a game for 90 minutes. Altogether it was OK, but not good enough,\u201d Favre said.\n\nThe draw left second-place Bayern a point ahead of Dortmund after five games. Leader Leipzig is three points ahead of Dortmund.\n\nDortmund hosts Bremen on Saturday, while Bayern visits bottom side Paderborn and Leipzig hosts Schalke.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Borussia Dortmund is under pressure after dropping more points in its bid to end Bayern Munich's Bundesliga dominance.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/germany_soccer_96368_c0-63-1708-1058_s1770x1032.jpg?63931e3ab783c209a76d8b0acae499f522c74a85", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
