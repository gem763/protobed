Baker, who has died aged 80, pioneered the image of the rock drummer as a flamboyant virtuoso, engaged in a dynamic interaction with the musicians around him.\n\nAccording to Neil Peart, the drummer from the Canadian band Rush: \u201cEvery rock drummer since has been influenced in some way by Ginger, even if they don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nBaker found fame with Cream, the 1960s rock trio also featuring Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, whose two-year career inspired a new wave of blues-based rock bands. Cream is now seen as the first \u201csupergroup\u201d, comprising outstanding musicians each of whom was blazing a trail on his respective instrument. Baker brought a freewheeling energy to his drumming, prompting comparisons to the jazz drummer Art Blakey. He was not abnormally fast or flashy, but he was innovative, using twin bass drums and displaying a flair for African-influenced beats, to which he had been introduced by the British jazz drummer Phil Seamen.\n\nBaker often claimed he never practised, but relied on spontaneous inspiration when playing with other musicians. Cream\u2019s stage shows often featured improvisations lasting 20 minutes or more, and the group\u2019s 1968 double album Wheels of Fire included a 16-minute version of the Willie Dixon song Spoonful, and 16 more minutes of Baker\u2019s drumming showcase Toad.\n\nThe idea of using the drumkit as a solo instrument was an innovation ascribed to Cream, though one that listeners would find a mixed blessing in years to come. The band was undeniably adept, however, at creating unusual but commercially potent singles. Hits such as I Feel Free (1966), White Room (1968), Sunshine of Your Love (1968), Tales of Brave Ulysses (1967) and Badge (1969) are some of the most atmospheric, rhythmic and distinctive compositions of their era.\n\nIn 1962 Baker, then a jobbing drummer in London\u2019s jazz clubs, had been recommended by Charlie Watts, the future Rolling Stones drummer, for a job with Alexis Korner\u2019s Blues Incorporated, where he first encountered Bruce. Along with Graham Bond and the saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith, the pair formed the Graham Bond Organisation, playing a form of jazzy rhythm and blues that won them a devoted following. However, they also developed a hostility that eventually led to Baker firing Bruce from the band.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cream performing in 1966.

Clapton was enthusiastic, but insisted on bringing in Bruce on bass. Despite misgivings, Baker agreed. Cream\u2019s debut single, Wrapping Paper (1966), was uncharacteristic light jazzy pop, but their debut album, Fresh Cream, released that December, found the group already hitting its distinctive stride in powerful tracks such as NSU, I\u2019m So Glad and Spoonful. It reached No 6 on the UK album chart.\n\nThe band released two further albums during its lifetime. Disraeli Gears (1967) was a formidable demonstration of their instrumental and compositional skills, while the live half of Wheels of Fire \u2013 a US chart-topper \u2013 illustrated the self-indulgence they were capable of in concert. The group split up in November 1968, at least partly because of the violent antagonism between Baker and Bruce, and a fourth album, Goodbye, appeared in February 1969. Despite being a short and scrappy collection of live and studio tracks, it gave them a UK No 1, and their four albums sold 15m copies between them.\n\nFollowing Cream\u2019s demise, Baker joined a new \u201csupergroup\u201d, Blind Faith, with Clapton, Steve Winwood (from Traffic) and bassist Ric Grech (from Family). Despite the huge success of Blind Faith\u2019s eponymous 1969 album, which topped both the US and British charts and sold half a million copies within a month of release, the band disintegrated that October, after completing a US tour. Baker was bitterly disappointed to find that Clapton was jumping ship (he departed to form Derek and the Dominoes) and decided he would form a band of his own.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton of Cream during their farewell performance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, 1968. Photograph: Susie Macdonald/Redferns\n\nHe brought Winwood and Grech into a new jazz-rock fusion project, Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force. The 11-piece lineup included drummers Seamen and Remi Kabaka, Bond on Hammond organ and saxophone, Denny Laine on guitar and a trio of brass players. The music was an exuberant and improvisational blend of blues, R&B, jazz and African music. Baker was always bitter that Bruce and the lyricist Pete Brown (the unofficial \u201cfourth member\u201d of Cream) had claimed most of the songwriting royalties from Cream, and so with Air Force and most of his future projects he figured prominently in the writing credits.\n\nWinwood and Grech stayed long enough to appear on the group\u2019s first album, a double LP live recording of a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1970, before departing to join a reunited Traffic. Without Winwood or Clapton, however, Baker could not pull the crowds.\n\nWhen the now nine-piece Air Force embarked on a US tour, it was met by miserable ticket sales and a lack of interest at radio stations. A second album, Ginger Baker\u2019s Air Force 2, was released in December 1970, but it failed to recapture the spontaneous magic of its predecessor, and both album and band slid into obscurity.\n\nAfter a near-fatal cocaine overdose that September, Baker realised he needed a complete break and, travelling by Land Rover, went to Lagos, Nigeria, where he opened a 16-track recording studio, Batakota (ARC) studios, and became close friends with local \u2013 later global \u2013 superstar Fela Kuti. Baker fully immersed himself in the rhythms of African music, and also joined the Lagos Polo Club. He retained his enthusiasm for horses and polo for the rest of his life.\n\nDuring his spell in Lagos, Baker featured on Kuti\u2019s 1971 album Live!, while Kuti appeared on Baker\u2019s Stratavarious (1972). In 1973 Paul McCartney and Wings recorded Picasso\u2019s Last Words (Drink to Me), from Band on the Run, at ARC, on which Baker shook a tin of gravel as percussion, though he was disgruntled that McCartney recorded the rest of his album at EMI\u2019s Lagos studios.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ginger Baker performing with Baker Gurvitz Army, 1975. Photograph: Colin Fuller/Redferns\n\nIn 1974 Baker formed the hard rock band Baker Gurvitz Army back in London, with brothers Adrian and Paul Gurvitz (on the guitar and the bass respectively), but after three albums \u2013 the last two of which failed to chart \u2013 in two years, the group fizzled out.\n\nFinding himself penniless and reduced to selling drugs, Baker left his wife, Liz (nee Finch), whom he had married in 1959, and their three children, and headed for Tuscany with his girlfriend, Sarah, to try to survive as an olive farmer (the pair married in 1983, but divorced the following year).\n\nHe was rescued by the record producer Bill Laswell, who tracked Baker down and took him to New York to play on Album (1986), the fifth studio album by John Lydon\u2019s Public Image Ltd (PiL). \u201cThe farm was a disaster,\u201d Laswell commented of Baker\u2019s Tuscan retreat. \u201cThere was no electricity, and he had this tiny bed he would sleep in with his dogs. It\u2019s a miracle that he was still alive.\u201d\n\nBorn in Lewisham, south-east London, Peter Baker \u2013 his red hair earned him the unoriginal nickname of \u201cGinger\u201d \u2013 was the son of Ruby Streatfield, who worked in a tobacconist\u2019s, and Frederick Baker, a brick-layer who was killed while serving with the Royal Corps of Signals in 1943. The young Ginger was aimless and unmotivated until he discovered a passion for competitive cycling.\n\nThis ended abruptly after his bike was wrecked in a collision with a London taxi. Then he experimented with playing drums belonging to a friend from Shooter\u2019s Hill grammar school, which inspired him to buy his own set for \u00a33. \u201cI thought, good God, at last there\u2019s something I can do,\u201d he recalled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cream performing Sunshine of Your Love\n\nHe began playing music part-time while working as a signwriter and then with an advertising agency, but after earning \u00a312 for a week\u2019s work with the Storyville Jazz Band he decided to turn professional. By the end of the decade he had played with Terry Lightfoot\u2019s New Orleans Jazzmen and bands run by the jazz clarinettist Acker Bilk and the jazz guitarist Diz Disley. However, the opinionated, combative Baker found himself frustrated by both his bandmates and the music\u2019s stylistic limitations. An unfortunate side-effect of his stints in London jazz clubs was a heroin habit that would dog him into the 80s.\n\nBaker weaned himself off the drug in that decade and, following, his work with PiL, continued to collaborate with Laswell, with his own album Horses & Trees (1986), an eclectic set featuring the violinist L Shankar and percussionist A\u00efyb Dieng, and Middle Passage (1990), a mix of Afrobeat, rock and jazz-fusion.\n\nIn 1988 Baker had moved to Los Angeles, where he met and married his third wife, Karen Loucks. In 1993 he moved to a ranch in Colorado to raise polo ponies. Also that year he recorded Sunrise on the Sufferbus with the hard rock band Masters of Reality, an album that produced the hit single She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress On).\n\nHe managed to fit in stints with the Ginger Baker Trio, with the guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Charlie Haden, and even briefly reunited with Bruce alongside the guitarist Gary Moore in BBM. However, in the late 90s, problems with the tax and immigration authorities forced him to leave the US for good.\n\nHe bought a farm in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, but upset the local all-white polo club by importing a team of black Nigerian players. Again forced to move, he resettled in Tulbagh in the Western Cape. In 2010, he was married for the fourth time, to a Zimbabwean woman, Kudzai Machokoto.\n\nIn 2005, Cream reunited for a series of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, preserved on the album Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6 2005. In 2009 Baker published Hellraiser: The Autobiography of the World\u2019s Greatest Drummer, co-written with his daughter Nettie. Jay Bulger\u2019s documentary Beware of Mr Baker premiered at the SXSW festival in 2012, and its raw portrayal of Baker\u2019s extraordinary life won it the grand jury award for best documentary feature. The same year, an impoverished Baker had to sell up and leave South Africa. He returned to London and formed a new quartet, Jazz Confusion, which in 2014 released Why?\n\nBaker, who had been suffering from degenerative osteoarthritis and a smoking-related pulmonary condition, is survived by Kudzai, his children, Nettie, Leda and Kofi, and a stepdaughter, Lisa.\n\n\u2022 Peter Edward \u201cGinger\u201d Baker, drummer, born 19 August 1939; died 6 October 2019", "description": "Trailblazing drummer who performed alongside Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce in the 1960s rock supergroup Cream", "authors": ["Adam Sweeting"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a341733d7b5c7483e57c038c21f00b4109914967/0_1380_2475_1485/master/2475.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3996cf1056601e25de85bccbeecf1022", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
