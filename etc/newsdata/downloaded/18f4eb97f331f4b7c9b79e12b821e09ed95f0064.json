They were all 23 to 35 years old at the beginning.\n\nResearchers tracked how often their income dropped, as well as the percentage of salary change between for each participant.\n\nParticipants fell into three groups - 1,108 (33.7 per cent) reported one drop of 25 per cent or more from their previous salary.\n\nA further 399 people (12.1 per cent) had two or more such drops, and 1,780 people (54 per cent) did not have any income drop.\n\nAt the end of the study, participants were given thinking and memory tests that measured how well they completed tasks and how much time it took to complete them.\n\nCAN MONEY AFFECT YOUR RISK OF DEMENTIA? According to research by University College London, poor people are more likely to develop dementia. The 20 per cent most deprived adults in England are 50 per cent more likely to suffer from severe memory loss than the wealthiest 20 per cent, a study found. Study author Professor Andrew Steptoe said: 'Our study confirms that the risk of dementia is reduced among well-off older people compared with those who have fewer economic resources. 'Many factors could be involved. Differences in healthy lifestyle and medical risk factors are relevant. 'It may also be that better off people have greater social and cultural opportunities that allow them to remain actively engaged with the world.' Dr Dorina Cadar, study author, said: 'Our findings demonstrate that socio-economic determinants influence dementia incidence, suggesting a higher risk for individuals with fewer financial resources.' Professor Tom Dening, from the University of Nottingham, said: 'It is likely that if wealth is associated with a lower risk of getting dementia, then it acts through these mechanisms, including contributing to better general health. '\"Money can't buy me love\" - but maybe it can help the brain a bit.' The researchers analysed 6,220 adults aged over 65 who were born between 1902 and 1943. Dementia diagnoses were made by doctors and questionnaires assessing cognitive decline. The findings were published in JAMA Psychiatry in May 2018.\n\nFor example, in one test, participants were shown a key that paired numbers one to nine with symbols.\n\nAll of the participants were then given a list of numbers and had to write down the corresponding symbols.\n\nResearchers found volunteers who had two or more pay cuts performed worse than those whose salary didn't change.\n\nOn average, their marks were 3.74 points lower - the equivalent of 2.8 per cent lower than their counterparts.\n\nData also showed volunteers who experienced one pay cut scored 2.87 points lower than those whose salary didn't change.\n\nThe results remained true after experts adjusted for other factors that could affect thinking skills, such as high blood pressure and education level.\n\nLead study author Dr Leslie Grasset, said: 'For reference, this poor performance is greater than what is normally seen due to one year in aging.'\n\nShe said one year of ageing often leads to participants scoring worse by only 0.71 points, on average - around 0.53 percent.\n\nParticipants who endured more than two income drops scored even worse on how much time it took to complete some tasks.\n\nThere was no difference between the groups on tests that measured verbal memory - that is, remembering words you hear.\n\nIn a separate branch of the study, 707 participants also had brain scans with MRI at the beginning and end of the study to measure their brain volume.\n\nPeople with two or more income drops had smaller total brain volume, compared to those whose salary stayed consistent.\n\nAnd volunteers who experienced one or more income drop had less white matter, which is tissue connecting different areas of the brain.\n\nIf white matter, made of nerve fibres, wastes away - normally due to disease - messages can't pass through.\n\nIf a person has white matter disease, they will gradually have difficulty with the ability to think, balance and walk.\n\nPrevious research suggests the volume and weight of the brain declines as we age - by around five per cent per decade when a person reaches 40 years old.\n\nDr Grasset said: 'Our exploratory study followed participants in the US through the recession in the late 2000s when many people experienced economic instability.\n\n'Our results provide evidence that higher income volatility and more income drops during peak earning years are linked to unhealthy brain aging in middle age.\n\n'Income volatility is at a record level since the 1980s and there is growing evidence that it may have pervasive effects on health.\n\n'Yet policies intending to smooth unpredictable income changes are being weakened in the US and many other countries.'\n\nThe academics suggested some indirect reasons for why an unstable income could influence brain health.\n\nDr Grasset said: 'Individuals who experience important income fluctuations may be more at risk for cardiovascular risk factors, depression, or perceived stress, which are in turn associated with poor cognitive health.'\n\nThose with financial instability may pick up unhealthy habits, such as drinking or smoking, or fail to manage diseases such as diabetes - which has many complications.\n\nThe study, published in Neurology, did not prove that drops in income cause poorer brain health, however.\n\nDr Grasset said further trials are needed to examine the role that social and financial factors play in brain ageing.\n\nThe study was limited because participants reported their income to researchers as falling within various income brackets, rather than specific figures.", "description": "Scientists in France assessed how the Great Recession impacted American's brains.
