Ford's due-to-close engine plant is the building you can see in the top right of this image\n\nIneos boss and billionaire, Sir Jim Ratcliffe (pictured), said the Grenadier will be the 'spiritual successor' to the Land Rover Defender\n\nFord's Bridgend plant is due to close in autumn 2020, costing around 1,700 local jobs\n\nDirk Heilmann, ceo of Ineos Automotive said the Ford factory closure was 'unfortunate' but the stated that the firm had 'already been looking at the location prior to the sad news [about Ford job losses] breaking'.\n\nThe factory will be built from scratch and initially create 200 new jobs, with up to 500 projected once full production ramps up.\n\nWith operations due to get underway next year, the location will offer a new opportunity for some of the area's skilled automotive workers who'll be out of employment from autumn 2020.\n\nWelsh government economy and transport minister, Ken Skates, said the announcement is 'great news for Wales' and will continue Bridgend's 'long history of skilled manufacturing expertise'.\n\nHe added: 'The Welsh Government has worked closely with the company to make this happen and I look forward to seeing the development of the new site progress ahead of the planned start of production in 2021.'\n\nFinancial support from the Welsh government is dependent on Ineos' ongoing investment and the number of jobs it creates, bosses said in a pre-announcement meeting.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe has been a keen Brexiteer\n\nTom Crotty, corporate affairs director for Ineos group, said the cheque from the Welsh government 'wasn't particularly large in the grand scheme of things' but it had made a significant effort to help 'clear the way to make the project happen'.\n\nCrotty also added that prime minister Boris Johnson had sent a message of support in the early hours before the news was made public.\n\nHe was quoted to have said: 'Today's announcement for Ineos will deliver hundreds of new jobs in Bridgend and is a vote of confidence in UK expertise making sure we keep our status as a pioneer in new vehicle technologies.'\n\nIneos confirmed the investment would also be used for a 'sub-assembly plant' in Estarreja, Portugal, which will create a similar number of new jobs to Bridgend.\n\nThe Iberian facility will produce the frames and body components for the vehicles that will be shipped to the Wales plant for vehicle assembly, along with BMW engines produced in Austria - a decision made in light of possible disruptions caused by Britain's planned departure from the EU on October 31.\n\n'We've done this whole project with Brexit hanging over us,' Cotty said.\n\n'We launched this project in January 2017, six months after the referendum. So we've known Brexit uncertainty and assumed that in all our planning.\n\n'To be honest, whatever happens, it happens - we can still make this work, and we think we can make it work successfully.'\n\nWhat does Ineos Automotive think of the new LR Defender? Tom Crotty, cooperate affairs director for Ineos group 'The new Defender is a great vehicle and will be very successful for JLR. 'I think they've produced a very nice vehicle but it's not what we're making. 'We're making a traditional ladder-frame chassis, body-on-chassis, rigid axles model - that's not what the new Defender is. 'It's a very different sector of the market.'\n\nWhen asked about the potential for a Brexit no-deal and the enforcement of World Trade Organisation rules, which would see a 10 per cent tax put on vehicles, he added: 'Our calculations show we have the ability to manage through that situation, so it's just not an issue for us. We're ignoring it.\n\n'To be honest, you'd need a cray supercomputer to work through all the potential scenarios. We believe we can manage whatever happens.'\n\nIneos Automotive is targeting sales of around 25,000 units annually once production of the 'uncompromising 4x4' was reached by the third or fourth year.\n\nThe UK and US are key markets for the car, as well Africa and Australia.\n\nBosses confirmed the vehicle itself won't be revealed for another 12 months.\n\nPrices have yet to be confirmed, though commercial director Mark Tennant said a double-cab pick-up version would be roughly around the same price as Europe's top-selling Ford Ranger Wildtrak twin-cab pick-up truck, which costs from around \u00a330,000 - some \u00a310,000 less than Land Rover's recently revealed next-generation Defender.\n\nThe name 'Grenadier' - taken from the pub around the corner from Ineos' UK head office - was also confirmed today, with plans for the vehicle until now being referred to as 'Projekt Grenadier'.\n\nIt will carry the name after a vote by more than 6,000 international fans and followers who responded to an online poll.\n\nThe name Grenadier will be used for the vehicle, as voted for in a poll by fans\n\nStuart Apperley, director and head of UK automotive at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said Ineos' decision to assemble the new vehicle in the UK is a 'welcome tonic for the sector given the headwinds manufacturers have faced'.\n\nHowever, he warned: 'Automotive is a notoriously tough industry for new entrants to break into and many will be watching with great interest to see how the business fairs, albeit Ineos has an impressive business track record.\n\n'While the timing may be seen as bold, Ineos' presence should provide a major boost for the economy in South Wales.\n\n'With Aston Martin now operating nearby in St Athan, there is the potential to create a high-value manufacturing cluster in the area, with all the positive knock-on benefits that would bring for the jobs market and development of the supply chain.'", "description": "One of Britain's richest men, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's no-frills 4x4, the Grenadier, will be built at a new site,  a stone's throw from Ford's soon-to-close engine plant, with production due to begin in 2021.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
