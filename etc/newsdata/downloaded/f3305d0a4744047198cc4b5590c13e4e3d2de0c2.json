She has two children, Katerina, 18, and Nina, 16.\n\nMIDLIFE CAREER CHANGE\n\nIn 2015, my husband of 23 years left me. I\u2019d just lost my sister to a brain aneurysm and both parents. I hit rock bottom. Yet it changed my outlook on life. I used to run a business and won NatWest Business Person of the Year in 2007. But I was so stressed. I\u2019ve realised how fleeting life is: you can\u2019t always be striving for something, you need to enjoy the people around you. Now I write self-help books for women, which I love.\n\nONE MEAL A DAY\n\nMost days, I eat only one meal. I stopped eating lunch at work, as I saw that it made my competitors drowsy. I have dinner at 7pm, and eat anything I want \u2014 usually tofu, chicken or salmon with vegetables; pasta or pizza; plus a big salad and wine. I drink lots of herbal teas, too, and snack on sunflower seeds.\n\nAuthor Alexandra Filia, 56, (pictured) from London, reveals how cosmetic treatments and daily workouts help to maintain her ageless appearance\n\nDATE YOUNGER MEN\n\nOne month after my divorce, I went to a singles event (meetup.com) and met Jeppe, a lovely Danish man, who was in London for work. We hit it off, despite a 24-year age gap. I never thought I\u2019d date a younger man, but he\u2019s more adventurous than most men my age, who can\u2019t keep up with me. I still love a challenge and take risks \u2014 I\u2019m climbing Everest next year!\n\nPRIORITISE YOUR NECK\n\nI don\u2019t want to stop ageing, just put the clock back a bit, to get another ten to 15 years of looking as good as I feel. So I\u2019ve tried several treatments, including a breast augmentation and tummy tuck. But the one surgical option I\u2019d recommend is a neck lift, as I think this really gives the game away. Mine cost \u00a31,800. I also have Botox twice a year (\u00a3200), and fillers (\u00a3300) once a year.\n\nEIGHT-MINUTE WORKOUT\n\nIt is so important to invest in yourself, but some of the things that make the most difference are free. Every morning at 6:30am, I do a YouTube video exercise, called Eight-Minute Abs: it uses crunches and press-ups to tone your arms and core. It\u2019s a super start to the day.\n\nloveisagame.net\n\nDo you look good for your age?
