During his annual speech to the Anglican Church\u2019s Sydney synod, Archbishop Glenn Davies told supporters of same-sex marriage to \u201cplease leave us\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy own view is that if people wish to change the doctrine of our church, they should start a new church or join a church more aligned to their views,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do not ruin the Anglican Church by abandoning the plain teaching of scripture.\u201d\n\nIn a report published on the Sydney Anglicans website, Davies\u2019s media manager, Russell Powell, said the archbishop received a standing ovation at the end of his address \u2013 as indeed he had.\n\nAnglican churches reject Sydney archbishop\u2019s stance on same-sex marriage Read more\n\nBut in pockets of the hall, there was also discomfort, if not with the core sentiment then with the tone. Davies has long been frustrated by what he believes is the excessive liberalism or tolerance of other Australian bishops towards same-sex relationships, particularly among clergy.\n\nNow he watches as two relatively small parts of the church \u2013 the dioceses of Wangaratta in Victoria and Newcastle in New South Wales \u2013 are moving to bless same-sex marriages.\n\nPro-gay marriage Anglicans are walking a fine line in the Australian church. Some want a full marriage rite, such as the one that exists in the Episcopal Church of the US. Others, such as the members of the Wangaratta synod, have voted to bless same-sex marriages conducted under civil law. To Sydney\u2019s \u201cguardians\u201d (their word) of orthodoxy, it is a distinction without difference.\n\nOne leading Sydney Anglican \u2013 supportive of but frustrated with Davies \u2013 could not work out if the archbishop\u2019s call to \u201cplease leave\u201d was a statement about \u201cdiscipline within the church as opposed to grace outside it\u201d. Was he simply insisting that bishops and priests stop agitating for the church to accommodate same-sex marriage? Or was the leader of Australia\u2019s most powerful Anglican diocese, in an unusually intemperate spray, shunning gay Christians at the door of the church?\n\nIt took Davies four days to clarify that his imprecise comments were directed at the bishops, not the parishioners, but the hurt has been profound, especially for those working in Anglican education and social services.\n\nThis is a critical moment for Australia\u2019s churches. They are attempting to persuade the federal government to accommodate their demands for greater religious freedom, including the right to hire staff whose lives accord to strict Biblical views of sex and sexuality. At the same time, they insist they welcome LGBT students into their schools and gay Australians to use their welfare services.\n\nThe archbishops of the important Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth dioceses rushed to say that no Christian or searcher, regardless of sexuality, would be turned away from church. Perth\u2019s Kay Goldsworthy, often mentioned as a future primate of the Australian church, lamented that \u201cit is troubling that the welcome is not universal\u201d.\n\nThe irony in all of this controversy is that Sydney\u2019s position \u2013 stripped of its incendiary and exclusionary language \u2013 is broadly the position of the Anglican Church of Australia. On Saturday, Melbourne\u2019s Anglican synod expressed \u201cregret\u201d at Wangaratta\u2019s decision and referred the issue to a church tribunal.\n\nThe church consensus on the issue is best personified by Goldsworthy and her Melbourne counterpart, Philip Freier. Goldsworthy voted \u201cyes\u201d in the 2017 marriage plebiscite, Freier \u201cno\u201d. But outside Sydney \u2013 where the diocese pumped $1 million into the \u201cno\u201d campaign \u2013 the church adopted a neutral position.\n\nThe church accepted the 62% vote in favour of same-sex marriage but, in the perennial Anglican way, set up a committee to study the way it would handle the issue, ahead of a special national meeting next year. Not even Goldsworthy said she would challenge the church\u2019s official marriage doctrine.\n\nOn issues of sexuality and women\u2019s ministry, the Sydney diocese is increasingly out of step with the church in the rest of Australia and certainly in the US, Canada, New Zealand and much of the UK. But it has reached into the church\u2019s growth areas \u2013 Africa, Asia and Latin America, known as the \u201cglobal south\u201d.\n\nSydney was the progenitor of an organisation called the Global Anglican Future Conference, or Gafcon, which enforces a strict reading of Scripture. Most of Gafcon\u2019s member churches remain within the official Anglican communion, recognised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nBut more ominously for the worldwide Anglican family, the Sydney diocese has a history of supporting schismatic churches, not endorsed by Canterbury. At the weekend, several Sydney bishops flew to New Zealand to consecrate a bishop not recognised by the official NZ church. They have done the same with the breakaway Anglican Church of North America.\n\nMost notoriously \u2013 decades before the controversies over sex, sexuality and even feminism \u2013 Sydney supported the Church of England in South Africa (CESA). It was a largely, if not officially, white breakaway movement from the official Anglican Church of Southern Africa. In 1997, CESA\u2019s leader begged forgiveness before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission for its inadequate response to the apartheid regime.\n\nThe Sydney diocese is also on the cusp of dominating the Australian church. Its evangelical theological college, Moore, is a powerhouse, churning out a couple of hundred graduates every year. These are the men \u2013 and increasingly women \u2013 who are ordained as priests and deacons, not just within the diocese but around the country.\n\nOther colleges with more liberal or pluralist views of scripture, such as Ridley and Trinity in Melbourne, simply cannot match the numbers.\n\nAnd with numbers comes power. At the 2017 national synod, Sydney and its allies in the dioceses of Tasmania, Armidale, North West Australia and segments of Melbourne and Adelaide, secured a narrow majority on the powerful standing committee.\n\nI\u2019m gay, married, and not leaving my church | Joel Hollier Read more\n\nPessimistic liberals believe Glenn Davies\u2019s harsh words \u2013 \u201cplease leave\u201d \u2013 betray a deeper motive \u2013 to claim the name \u201cthe Anglican Church of Australia\u201d and as much property, push out all liberals and even moderates and then split more formally from the worldwide communion under the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nWriting in the June edition of the diocesan newspaper Southern Cross, Davies emphasised that the constitution of the church \u201cdoes not tie us to Canterbury\u201d but only to those churches with doctrine that is consistent with the so-called \u201cFundamental Declarations\u201d \u2013 the Bible, the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles. Sydney has also boycotted the Lambeth Conference, called every 10 years by the Archbishop of Canterbury and considered a critical symbol of Anglican unity.\n\nModerate evangelicals doubt Sydney wants to formally split from Canterbury, pointing out it might not then be able to call itself \u201cAnglican\u201d and hold onto all its property without a fight in the civil courts.\n\nIn largely secular Australia in 2019, that\u2019s the last place any church would want to be.\n\nAndrew West is the presenter of The Religion & Ethics Report on ABC Radio National.", "description": "The blunt words of Sydney archbishop Glenn Davies come at a critical moment for Australian churches and demands for religious freedom", "authors": ["Andrew West"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40ec1eefbaacfb596e4c66203f2ab1662344d549/493_98_1564_938/master/1564.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e9aa97b8ba3d1a55beec8f5ec860438f", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
