(Deb Lindsey)\n\nBuck\u2019s Fishing & Camping\n\n(Good/Excellent)\n\nEvery food critic I know has a \u201cCheers,\u201d a place they tend to frequent when they\u2019re not on the clock, typically because the food is familiar and the staff makes it easy. For years, my few nights off from professional grazing found me in the honey-lit dining room of this casual American restaurant with a handsome communal table running down the center and a canoe suspended from the rafters. Yeah, I glance at the menu, but at this point, I pretty much know I\u2019ll be getting the wood-grilled pork chop or the fish of the day, flanked by some interesting accompaniments, or splitting the prime hamburger and a Caesar salad with my significant other. Call me a creature of habit. Dessert is either the most comforting buttermilk chocolate cake around or a book at Politics & Prose next door. My sole complaint, and the reason I\u2019m inclined to \u201ccheat\u201d these days with Johnny\u2019s Half Shell: Buck\u2019s needs to woo me with some new tricks on its menu.\n\n2.5 stars\n\nBuck\u2019s Fishing & Camping: 5031 Connecticut Ave. NW. 202-364-0777. bucksfishingandcamping.com.\n\nOpen: Dinner daily.\n\nPrices: Mains $16-$39.\n\nSound check: 75 decibels / Must speak with raised voice.\n\n--\n\nThe following review was originally published as part of The Washington Post\u2019s 2017 Fall Dining Guide.\n\n\n\nBuck\u2019s serves up good food \u2014 like a prime beef burger on a homemade sesame bun with twice-cooked french fries \u2014 in a comfortable, neighborhood setting. (Deb Lindsey /For The Washington Post)\n\nBuck\u2019s Fishing & Camping tastes like home\n\n(Good/Excellent)\n\nBecause when a food critic needs a break from tasting menus and nasturtium petals, Buck\u2019s comes to the rescue with familiar American comforts \u2014 cornmeal-fried oysters, a prime beef hamburger on a house-baked bun \u2014 done very well. Because the communal table that runs down the center of the arty dining room is the design equivalent of a group hug. Because the head waiter, Nour eddine Bouzerda, whom I\u2019ve known for years, understands my tastes as well as I do and plays upset when I get back from a trip and it\u2019s not his native Morocco. Because the buttermilk chocolate cake tastes like the fantasy version of my mom\u2019s. Because we all crave a place where we can let our hair down.\n\n---\n\nThe following review was originally published Oct. 30, 2013.\n\n\n\nBuck's Fishing & Camping is a reliable dining destination in upper Northwest D.C. (Scott Suchman/For The Washington Post)\n\nBuck\u2019s Fishing & Camping in Chevy Chase still charms at age 10\n\nFor those of us who live to eat, 2013 will go down as one of the most appetizing years in recent memory. Fourteenth Street NW has hogged most of the ink and the bandwidth, with the debuts of such standard-bearers as Etto, Le Diplomate, Doi Moi and Kapnos, but other neighborhoods share credit for burnishing the Washington dining scene as well. No sooner did it open its doors this fall than Rose\u2019s Luxury became the best place to eat on Capitol Hill, and Daikaya improved the odds of getting a good meal near Verizon Center with two fine menus under one roof, one devoted to ramen, the other to upscale Japanese pub fare. By the time you read this, Iron Gate Inn should have made a comeback in Dupont Circle, with ace chef Tony Chittum at the stove.\n\nThe crush of so many fresh subjects to write about means I\u2019ve had less time to keep tabs on restaurants that have fed food fans for a while, which is a long way of congratulating Buck\u2019s Fishing & Camping on the occasion of its 10th anniversary in October.\n\nA decade might not seem like a long time to most people; for those of us steeped in the industry, however, 10 years is practically middle age. Among the constants in its picture have been Buck\u2019s signature blood-red walls; its (truly) prime dry-aged New York strip steak; and owner James Alefantis, 38. The restaurateur retains the boyish charm he has always had and mixes easily and gleefully with the many notables \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard \u2014 who add sizzle to the American restaurant, a Cafe Milano for boldface names who care about good food.\n\nThere\u2019s probably nothing you haven\u2019t heard of on Buck\u2019s short menu, but there are few local kitchens that do its familiar dishes better.\n\nI\u2019ve munched on fields of onion rings over the years, but few plates compel me to get to the bottom like the one at Buck\u2019s. The snack appears too white to have been fried, but sure enough, the crisp rings in light coats of beer batter have been expertly cooked. They\u2019re great alone, sensational after a dunk in smoked pepper mayonnaise, a detail that underscores how the kitchen distinguishes itself is small ways. A fist of cool iceberg lettuce is dressed up with the usual garnishes \u2014 crumbles of smoky bacon and blue cheese \u2014 but sets itself apart from the pack with a creamy, horseradish-sharpened dressing. Butternut squash soup is, frankly, boring in contrast. Did anyone taste the bland bowl before it went out? Roasted almonds tossed with fresh rosemary, on the other hand, is a nibble I plan to put out on my coffee table at my next dinner party.\n\n\u201cWorld-Famous\u201d precedes that steak on the menu, and while I might not go that far, the $39 entree is a terrific piece of meat that picks up lots of flavor from being cooked over wood and comes flanked by potatoes that are, as any good chef knows, fried twice to make them crisp. (The poor man\u2019s version here is the steak frites featuring an eight-ounce culotte for $19.) I\u2019m just as happy eating the bone-in pork chop, with meat from a farm on the Eastern Shore that grows its own feed for the pigs. A side of fresh, barely creamy cole slaw makes the grill-striped main dish even more compelling.\n\nJames Rexroad is only the fourth person to helm the kitchen. Like his predecessors, including the memorable opening chef, Carole Greenwood, he opts for good sense over high style. Rockfish gets framed in basil-laced cranberry and kidney beans, while plump roast chicken is brightened with lemony pan juices. Both dishes are more about ingredients than a chef showing off.\n\nThe single meatless entree sounds like a page from the original \u201cMoosewood Cookbook,\u201d hearty and retro. But quinoa bulked up with sauteed mushrooms, wilted chard and a beautiful poached egg on top pleased even the dedicated cavemen at my table with its nutty nuances and gentle but persistent heat from serrano oil.\n\nI can easily pass on chocolate. The flavor is seldom my thing, except at Buck\u2019s, where I always order a fat slice of the chocolate buttermilk cake, which comes with a glossy drape of chocolate sauce, added just before serving, and a dollop of fresh whipped cream. My mom makes a similar comfort, moist and not too sweet. Whatever fruit is in season might be turned into something quietly wonderful, too. Recently, there was apple crisp, which I like because the fruit remains the focus.\n\nLooks matter to Alefantis, who also heads the board of the Transformer gallery. Over the bar hangs a fetching riff on Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d; the oil-on-linen nude was painted by former Washington artist Lucy Hogg. A sense of intimacy comes by way of glass-blown amber lights over the 20-foot-long poplar table that runs down the center of the dining room. And yes, after all these years, there\u2019s still a canoe displayed in the rafters.\n\nAlefantis says he\u2019s as close to a \u201cBuck\u201d as you will find at Buck\u2019s. The name lends a sense of folksiness to the establishment, while \u201cFishing & Camping\u201d is a subtle way of promoting the restaurant\u2019s commitment to locality. (To the owner\u2019s amusement, he says he gets the occasional call from people inquiring about fishing licenses.)\n\nThe staff tends to be relaxed and smart and swift. Nour Bouzarda is first among equals, not just because the Morocco native makes me feel as if I\u2019m eating in his home but because he has the gift of reading a diner\u2019s mind. Unlike the servers at too many hot spots, Bouzarda comes across as honored to have you rather than making you feel privileged to have him. Plus, he makes excellent wine recommendations.\n\nThe restaurant scene is ablaze with new stars. Buck\u2019s testifies to the allure, and the value, of patina in the firmament.", "description": "This is the place to go when you want something familiar and fabulous.", "authors": ["Tom Sietsema", "Food Critic", "October At Am", "Tom Sietsema Has Been The Washington Post'S Food Critic Since He Previously Worked For The Microsoft Corp.", "Where He Launched Sidewalk.Com", "The Seattle Post-Intelligencer", "The San Francisco Chronicle", "The Milwaukee Journal.
