In order to simplify current menu options and make room for future menu items, Taco Bell plans to cut nine items.\n\nSome of the items being removed include the beloved Cool Ranch flavored Doritos Locos Taco, and the Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos. At least for now, the Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco is safe.\n\n\u201cTaco Bell is always evolving and enhancing our menu to meet fans\u2019 evolving cravings, giving them more of what they want and less of what they don\u2019t,\u201d Taco Bell said in an email to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe Doritos Locos Tacos.

Most recently, Popeyes launched its first-ever chicken sandwich on August 12 \u2014 and has since sold out of the sandwich amid chart-busting demand.\n\nMeanwhile on Monday, Taco Bell\u2019s sister company KFC announced that it was testing Beyond Meat (BYND) chicken in an Atlanta-area pilot program. The fake-meat item sold out within hours.\n\nDespite already boasting a pretty extensive menu for those who don\u2019t consume meat, Taco Bell plans to bet even bigger on the vegans and vegetarians.\n\nIn April, the restaurant announced that it was testing a new veggie menu in select Dallas, Texas stores. Some of the new items included a Vegatarian Quesarito and a Vegetarian Crunchwrap supreme. Taco Bell would not confirm to Yahoo Finance that the space being made on the menu was for a new vegetarian-friendly line up.\n\nTaco Bell continues to be the star of the Yum Brands (YUM) family. The taco chain has seen strong sales momentum, and in its most recent quarter, Taco Bell same-store sales grew at a healthy 7%, eclipsing expectations for 3.8% growth.\n\nShares of Yum Brands have jumped nearly 28% this year, as of Thursday\u2019s close.\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
