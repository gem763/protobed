The men could be heard laughing at the shark on the recording, which was posted to social media and generated widespread outrage.\n\nThe Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission led the prosecution against Benac and Michael Wenzel, 23, who took a similar plea deal in February, according to the Bradenton Herald.\n\nFLORIDA MAN SAYS HE SMASHED CAR WINDOWS BECAUSE 'TRUMP OWES ME 1 TRILLION DOLLARS'\n\nIn addition to the 10-day jail sentence, Benac was given 11 months of probation, ordered to pay a $2,500 fine and perform 250 hours of community service, 125 of which must be spent at an animal shelter, the outlet reported. He also lost his fishing license for three years.\n\nBenac pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of aggravated cruelty to animals and violation of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission rules.\n\nBenac, Wenzel and Spencer Heintz, 35, were arrested in December 2017, but the charges against Heintz were eventually dropped, according to the Bradenton Herald.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN VICTIMS REUNITE WITH THEIR BELOVED PETS WEEKS AFTER STORM\n\nBenac and Wenzel weren't as lucky.\n\nFollowing the incident, other videos began to surface involving the men. One showed Wenzel shooting a shark with a .38-caliber revolver and another showed the men pouring alcohol down the throats of fish that were alive, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\n\u201cWe were confident in what we could do and what we could show, but at the end of the day you can never be 100 percent confident in the jury system ...,\u201d Benac's lawyer, Justin Petredis said. \u201cThat was a worry, that the anger and emotions of the jury would outweigh where we were hoping common sense would take over.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPetredis said Benac took the plea deal because of how widely the videos had been shared online, the outlet reported. Benac also received credit for a day spent in the county jail.", "description": "A Florida man who recorded a shark being dragged to its death behind a high-speed boat accepted a plea deal on Thursday and was sentenced to 10 days in jail.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Robert-Lee-Benac-Hillsborough-County-Sheriff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
