The government is still steadfastly committed to achieving a budget surplus this financial year.\n\nSo fiscal and monetary policy are at loggerheads - with Canberra mildly tightening and Martin Place loosening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowe has made clear he would prefer not to be easing rates to ultra-low levels or contemplating so-called quantitative easing (QE) - essentially done by the central bank artificially creating money to buy financial assets from private investors and pushing down bond yields.\n\nShadow treasurer Jim Chalmers has called on Frydenberg to heed Lowe\u2019s pleas. Labor wants more spending on areas such as the Newstart unemployment allowance or rapid-fire infrastructure projects, while conveniently saying Frydenberg still doesn\u2019t have to jeopardise a surplus given it is forecast to be $7 billion.\n\nFrydenberg argues a surplus is a positive signal to investors, business and investors that the government is prudently managing its books and the economy.\n\nHe has signalled a willingness to consider a modest business investment tax break in the May budget next year.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has suggested the budget could be recalibrated earlier in the December mid-year update if the economic circumstances warrant it.\n\nBut so far this mainly feels like Canberra fiddling around the edges.\n\nFrydenberg must now fully answer if he would prefer the RBA to keep cutting rates towards zero and embark on QE, or if the better course of action would be an injection of fiscal stimulus to boost the economy in the short run and more structural reform in areas such as tax and competition policy to lift productivty in the medium term.\n\nA summit of Treasury, RBA, financial regulators and bankers would provide an opportunity for a healthy debate on monetary and fiscal policy, so that\u2019s why Frydenberg will run a million miles from Elliott\u2019s suggestion.", "description": "ANZ chief Shayne Elliott\u2019s call for an economic summit to look at the effect of ultra-low interest rates puts the spotlight on government policy levers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7957%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_154/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e99112f1a17acb62e5be88388bea3106fcce5e46", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
