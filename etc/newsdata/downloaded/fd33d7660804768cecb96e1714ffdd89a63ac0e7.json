(Rick Scuteri/AP)\n\nThursday night\u2019s game between the Packers and Bears marked the official start of the NFL season. This year, the offseason headlines were dominated by Raiders wide receiver Antonio Brown. Most recently, Brown left the team following an altercation with his own general manager, apparently leaving him in danger of a suspension, before the team reversed course on Friday and said it expected Brown to play Monday night against the Denver Broncos. And that was before the YouTube video. Yes, you read that right.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Here\u2019s a recap of how we got to this point:\n\nHow good is Antonio Brown?\n\nEven those fans that have grown tired of the drama that surrounds Brown would admit that the 31-year-old is very good at football. Drafted in the sixth round in 2010 out of Central Michigan, he grew into one of the league\u2019s most dynamic pass-catchers over the course of his nine seasons in Pittsburgh.\n\nBrown topped 1,000 yards receiving in seven of the past nine seasons and led the league in that category in 2014 and 2017. He\u2019s been selected first team all-Pro four times and was chosen for the Pro Bowl seven times. He is, undeniably, one of the game\u2019s best offensive weapons.\n\n[Raiders allow Antonio Brown to return, say he\u2019ll play Monday night against Broncos]\n\nWhy did he leave Pittsburgh?\n\nLast year was a tumultuous one in Pittsburgh, with star running back Le\u2019Veon Bell missing the entire season due to a holdout, the Steelers missing the playoffs and a sense of frustration among the team and its fans. Brown was at the center of it. There were several unexcused absences, a spat with longtime Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger over a Week 12 interception and a knee injury.\n\nEverything came to a head in Week 17, when Brown missed a must-win game against the Browns. Brown was said to have been out because of his knee, but it was later reported that an ugly practice altercation with Roethlisberger was the root cause. Brown left the practice because of it, and reportedly had no contact with the team after that point. He showed up at the game expecting to play, but didn\u2019t make it to the field and left the stadium at halftime.\n\nThis was the final blow to the relationship between Brown and the Steelers. The team shopped him around the league once the offseason began. In February, Brown tweeted that it was \u201ctime to move on.\u201d\n\nHow did he end up in Oakland?\n\nThat was a bit complicated, too. Late on the night of March 7, NFL Network reported that the Buffalo Bills were closing in on a deal for Brown. Buffalo was one of four teams said to be interested in acquiring Brown, along with the Redskins, Titans and Raiders.\n\nWithin an hour of the report, Brown called it \u201cfake news\u201d on Instagram. By the next morning, the Bills said talks had fallen through.\n\nTwo days later, Brown was traded to Oakland for third- and fifth-round picks in the 2019 draft.\n\nHow is his relationship with the Steelers now?\n\nLet\u2019s just say that absence has not made Brown\u2019s heart grow fonder. in August, NBC aired a video of Roethlisberger telling Michele Tafoya he regretted calling out Brown because it \u201cruined a friendship.\u201d Then Brown tweeted that Roethlisberger was never his friend. \u201cShut up already,\u201d he wrote in the tweet that was later deleted.\n\nWhen did the Raiders drama start?\n\nThe public drama surrounding Brown\u2019s tenure with the Raiders started from the feet up. At some point in July, Brown underwent cryotherapy treatment, designed to relieve pain through freezing temperatures.\n\nApparently Brown\u2019s feet were not properly covered during the treatment, because he got severe frostbite. The injury kept him out of early training camp sessions, and he sought help from a specialist. Photos of the injury were gruesome, but the team expected Brown to heal quickly and return to the team. That was the plan, at least.\n\nAnd the helmet stuff?\n\nAh yes, the helmet stuff. On August 9, ESPN reported that, while the foot injury was still an issue, the bigger concern for Brown and the team had to do with his helmet. New league safety rules, introduced in 2017, mandated that players had to use any number of newer, approved helmet models. Brown, who had been using a Schutt AiR Advantage helmet since his rookie season, would no longer be allowed to do so.\n\nBrown took this issue seriously enough that he reportedly threatened retirement over it.\n\nAnd now this: Raiders\u2019 WR Antonio Brown has told team officials that, unless he gets to wear his old helmet, he will not play football again, per league sources.\n\n\n\nAnd more.... \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) August 9, 2019\n\nHe filed a special request with an independent arbitrator. It was denied. He filed another grievance with the league. Also denied.\n\nIs that why he was facing a possible suspension?\n\nNope. In fact, Brown announced last week that he\u2019d be using a Xenith Shadow helmet, which came with a nice little endorsement deal.\n\nBrown\u2019s most recent drama stemmed from an entirely separate incident. Brown had been fined by the team for unexcused practice absences and posted a picture of the fine letter on social media, voicing his displeasure.\n\nBrown and Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock reportedly got into a heated altercation over this. Things never turned physical, but Brown reportedly had to be held back by teammates.\n\nOn Thursday, NFL Network reported that Brown would not be with the team for its Week 1 game against Denver. By Friday, NFL Network reported there was a chance that Brown will play against the Broncos, and ESPN reported that Brown had apologized to the team. Later Friday, the team changed course.\n\nSo where do things stand?\n\nIn an abrupt reversal, the team allowed Brown to rejoin the team Friday and opted against suspending or releasing him, at least for now.\n\nCrisis over?\n\n\n\nJon Gruden says Antonio Brown is playing Monday night.

The Raiders appear to be giving Brown at least one more chance, and he is now scheduled to play in the Raiders\u2019 season-opening home game Monday night, according to Coach Jon Gruden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Gruden told reporters Friday at the team\u2019s training facility. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, yes.\u201d\n\nStill, plans have a way of changing, as the Brown saga has demonstrated.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Steelers are less talented than a year ago.
