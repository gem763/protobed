He promised he \u201cwill not let this matter lie\u201d.\n\nBut in a second letter to parents, sent to news.com.au, Mr Russell admitted the problem was far worse than he first suspected.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are aware that the use of misogynistic language such as in the chant on Saturday, is more widespread than we understood and this knowledge has intensified our determination to resolutely reshape our programs and to look to do so much more in this area,\u201d Mr Russell wrote.\n\n\u201cThe size of our challenge has been clearly illustrated to me by my knowledge that some recent graduates foolishly and recklessly thought it would be amusing when they were celebrating to use this horrible chant.\u201d\n\nFormer Year 12 student Luka Kiernan, 19, spoke out publicly about the \u201chypermasculine\u201d culture at St Kevin\u2019s that he says \u201cpervades\u201d every aspect of school life.\n\nBut after going public with his complaints \u2014 both to school staff and the media \u2014 he was attacked.\n\nMr Kiernan shared a copy of his defaced school portrait that hangs on the school\u2019s High Achiever\u2019s Board. Across his face was the word \u201ctraitor\u201d and beneath was the word \u201csnitch\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve received quite a lot of harassment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody breaks from the ruling class discipline like I\u2019ve done, when somebody cuts against the grain, they are absolutely victimised because you\u2019re not allowed to leave the \u2018boys\u2019 club\u2019 and you\u2019re certainly not allowed to criticise it publicly.\u201d\n\nMr Kiernan told news.com.au the release of a second video \u201cdemonstrates how unseriously these students take allegations of sexism\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt proves it\u2019s not a minority of extreme sexists, it\u2019s an ingrained culture that is adhered to by the majority of the school population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dogmatic tribalism that\u2019s pedalled by the school. It\u2019s demanded that a key part of your identity is that you are part of the elite class.\n\n\u201cAnyone that goes against that culture is disowned and torched. The people that participate (in sexist chanting) are the most privileged and elite men in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cThey know they can probably get away with it. The privilege gives them the confidence to do whatever they want to do.\u201d\n\nNews.com.au reached out to a number of the students in the latest recording but did not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nrohan.smith1@news.com.au | @ro_smith", "description": "Days after the furore over young men from a prestigious Melbourne private school reciting a vile chant on a tram, audio has emerged of other students from the same school performing a disgusting, misogynistic rap.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/90b5d0384ac901c039af60f8dc066feb?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
