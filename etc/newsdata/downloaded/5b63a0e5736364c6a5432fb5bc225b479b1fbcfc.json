The survey was conducted between September 19 and 30.\n\n1. Rating South Africa\n\nWill South Africa hold on to its sole investment-grade rating from Moody\u2019s in 2019?\n\nA majority of those surveyed expect the country to stay out of junk territory in the assessment of Moody\u2019s Investor Service. That\u2019s despite financial markets pricing in a downgrade for months. Both the S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings cut their assessments to junk in 2017.\n\nSeen as crucial to the judgment: South Africa\u2019s plan for troubled state-owned utility Eskom's, which saw its stand-alone rating lowered deeper into junk by Fitch on October 1. Underlying these fiscal issues are South Africa\u2019s growth concerns, with the economy having entered its 70th month of a weakening cycle in September.\n\n2. Yuan and trade war\n\nWith lingering US-China trade tensions, is it more likely for the yuan to strengthen beyond 6.95 per dollar offshore or fall past 7.25 by the end of 2019?", "description": "Despite markets pricing in a downgrade, a survey has revealed that a majority of traders expect Moody's to keep SA at investment grade.", "authors": ["- Marcus Wong", "Yumi Teso"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7335/730bc18143ba4ea296af6541d3f05edd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
