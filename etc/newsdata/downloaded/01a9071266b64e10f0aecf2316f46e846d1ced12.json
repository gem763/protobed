Experts say no", "language": "en", "text": "When LeBron James chose to put protecting his business interests in China ahead of promoting democracy and free speech, it came at a price.\n\nHe alienated a portion of his fans back home who have long admired his willingness to take a public stand against social injustice.\n\nSports business and crisis communications experts told Yahoo Sports that LeBron should have struck a more diplomatic, even-handed tone Monday night when he criticized Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for his tweet that angered the Chinese government. They don\u2019t expect LeBron to lose sponsorships or endorsements as a result of his comments, but they do believe he has damaged his reputation with some American consumers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cIt's not a good look for LeBron,\u201d said Bob Dorfman, executive director of San Francisco-based Baker Street Advertising. \u201cWhile I can't see it irreparably harming his image, it will definitely take a hit. Any future comments he makes on pretty much any issue will likely be met with the suspicion that he's only looking out for his best interests \u2014 and the money always comes first. It's a shame, as LeBron has always been one of the good guys in pro sports, as humanitarian-driven as he is profit-driven.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators hold up photos of LeBron James grimacing during a rally at the Southorn Playground in Hong Kong, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019. Protesters in Hong Kong have thrown basketballs at a photo of James and chanted their anger about comments he made about free speech. (AP)\n\nThe standoff between China and the NBA began 11 days ago when Morey tweeted a message of support to Hong Kong protesters fighting to preserve some semblance of independence and to avoid total Chinese control. China angrily responded with a display of economic clout, yanking sponsorships, removing Rockets games from its airwaves and practically threatening to shut down the NBA\u2019s business in its most profitable international market if more criticism followed.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeBron had not been available to the media while the Los Angeles Lakers toured China last week, so he made his first public comments during a pregame session before an exhibition game at Staples Center on Monday night. He described Morey as \u201cmisinformed,\u201d lambasting him for sending his tweet while NBA teams were in China and for not considering the economic ramifications of angering the world\u2019s most populous basketball market.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand [when] he spoke,\u201d James said. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\n\n\u201cSo be careful what we tweet and say and do. Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d\n\nThe backlash to those comments arrived so swiftly on social media that LeBron apparently felt compelled to clarify them.\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nCrisis communications specialists who spoke to Yahoo Sports were surprised that LeBron didn\u2019t have a more polished, calculated response ready given the amount of time he had to prepare. They would have advised LeBron to say less and to be more sympathetic to Morey.\n\n\u201cHe seemed to really only be focused on how the [Morey] tweet impacted the NBA and its players and not necessarily focused on the more global issues related to human rights violations by China,\u201d said Terry Fahn, a strategic communications and crisis management specialist for Sitrick and Company. \u201cThat\u2019s where he erred.\n\n\u201cHe could have said, \u2018I understand why Darryl Morey would want to speak about the protest but I also think he didn\u2019t consider the impact it would have on the league and its players. This is a complicated issue and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it at this time.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to make anyone happy but he\u2019d have threaded the needle by acknowledging both sides.\u201d\n\nOperating in China is often delicate for foreign corporations eager to establish a foothold in a lucrative international market yet wary of facing criticism for looking the other way on repression and human rights violations. Marriott and Mercedes-Benz are among the major corporations that have kowtowed to China after employee criticism of Chinese policy led to threats from the government.\n\nThe NBA and its players are especially vulnerable to such tactics because of how much they have invested in growing the Chinese market.\n\nThe NBA has staged at least one exhibition game in China every year since 2004 and rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars per year in digital and TV rights deals. Players are invested in China, too, as LeBron, Kobe Bryant, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are among the stars who make annual offseason trips to meet fans and hawk merchandise.\n\nWhereas Curry, Steve Kerr and other NBA luminaries have deftly sidestepped questions about Morey\u2019s tweet and China\u2019s history of human rights violations, LeBron allowed himself to be swept into the controversy. A player who in the past has been so outspoken in his dislike of President Trump or in protesting police brutality this time gave the impression to some that he was putting money above morality.\n\n\u201cThe best comment he could have made would have been no comment,\u201d said Jiaflix co-founder Marc Ganis, a sports business consultant who has engineered a number of significant deals in China. \u201cThis is one of those situations where anything that is said will generate detractors and has the potential to cause problems. That\u2019s where this situation is right now and that\u2019s why letting time go by is probably the best approach right now. The issue is so hot that no matter what you say, someone from a perspective will find reason to be outraged by it.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his comments, LeBron has been a target for criticism all over the globe. Hong Kong protesters burned and trampled his jersey. Fellow athletes and grandstanding politicians blasted him on social media. Only his corporate sponsors have stayed silent, something that experts expect to continue barring the unlikely event that widespread organized protests occur.\n\n\u201cShort of that happening, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in jeopardy of losing sponsors,\u201d Fahn said. \u201cHe may find himself booed more vociferously in certain arenas and subject to isolated publicity attempts by people who are pro-democracy in Hong Kong, but if it\u2019s not well organized and doesn\u2019t gain traction, I don\u2019t think his sponsors will take any action.\u201d\n\nWhat can LeBron do now to repair the damage done to his reputation and ensure that doesn\u2019t happen?\n\n\u201cMaybe just keep quiet until this blows over,\u201d says Dorfman.\n\nGanis and Fahn had similar opinions.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that the smartest, most erudite people in our society have trouble threading the needle on,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cSometimes the best approach is to do what you do better than anyone else in the planet, entertain the fans, focus on those issues that you\u2019re passionate about and maybe stay on the sidelines on this topic. Say, \u2018I don\u2019t know enough to comment.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Experts don\u2019t expect LeBron to lose sponsorships or endorsements as a result of his comments, but they do believe he has damaged his reputation with some American consumers.", "authors": ["Jeff Eisenberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1uXnoqI6JJhly269i35I6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.xcZ01RRxRWUfsSHUMB_nA--~B/aD0zMzM0O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e8540080-ef67-11e9-bfcc-90fd593c454c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
