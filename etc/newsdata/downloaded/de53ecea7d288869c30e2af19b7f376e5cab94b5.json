Mike Lee (R-Utah) introduced Menashi. And the nominee spent most of his time angering Republicans and Democrats by refusing to provide details about what he\u2019s worked on in his current role as a White House legal adviser (yes, Trump nominated one of his own aides to be a federal judge).\n\nAs senators asked him which particular issues he has provided legal advice on \u2015 immigration policies crafted by White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, for example \u2015 Menashi repeatedly declined to say and cited confidentiality.\n\n\u201cDid you work on the administration\u2019s decision to end deferred deportation for undocumented immigrants who are receiving treatment for life-threatening illnesses?\u201d asked Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\n\u201cSenator, again, consistent with my duties of confidentiality to the client ...\u201d began Menashi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking what advice you gave,\u201d interrupted Durbin. \u201cI\u2019m asking you if you worked on the issue of denying DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] status to those receiving treatment for life-threatening illnesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSenator, again, I want to be as transparent as possible ...\u201d Menashi responded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an unfair question,\u201d interjected Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the committee chairman and a strong Trump ally. \u201cIt\u2019s a specific question. Did you give legal advice on the subject matter?\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS White House lawyer Steven Menashi frustrated both sides by stonewalling senators' questions about the work he does for President Trump.\n\nIt went back and forth like this for several rounds. Menashi, who has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, finally said he \u201cmay\u201d have worked on the DACA issue since he advises on immigration policy, but he couldn\u2019t recall.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a really smart guy but I wish you\u2019d be more forthcoming,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said later, with folded arms and reading glasses balanced on the tip of his nose. \u201cThis isn\u2019t supposed to be a game. We\u2019re supposed to try to understand not how you\u2019re going to rule but how you\u2019re going to think.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. John Kennedy was not amused by Steven Menashi's refusal to answer his questions.\n\nOf course, Menashi\u2019s hearing could have been worse. Some of his toughest would-be questioners weren\u2019t there. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are all members of the Judiciary Committee, but they all missed the hearing because they\u2019re out on the campaign trail running for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nMost of the fireworks around Menashi occurred outside in the hallway, where dozens of protesters clogged the walkways and led loud chants as the hearing was underway.\n\n\u201cTitle IX is on the line! Title IX is on the line!\u201d they shouted, referring to Menashi\u2019s role in helping Education Secretary Betsy DeVos roll back Title IX protections for survivors of sexual assault on campuses in 2017. He was DeVos\u2019 legal counsel at the time.\n\nCapitol Police swarmed the scene and at least five people were arrested.\n\nProtesters just erupted into loud shouting: \"Title IX is on the line! Title IX is on the line!\"\n\n\n\nThey can definitely hear this in the hearing. pic.twitter.com/y9Q6bkikOe \u2014 Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) September 11, 2019\n\nProgressive groups are opposed to Menashi\u2019s nomination because of his long record of opposing and undermining equality for communities of color, women and LGBTQ people. As CNN reported, Menashi has complained about \u201cgynocentrists\u201d participating in Take Back the Night marches, accused the Human Rights Campaign of having \u201cincessantly exploited the slaying of Matthew Shepard\u201d for political benefit, and claimed that a Dartmouth fraternity wasn\u2019t being racist when it held a \u201cghetto party\u201d attended by white partygoers wearing Afro wigs and carrying toy guns.\n\nHe has also denounced women\u2019s marches as sexual assault, opposed the \u201cradical abortion rights advocated by campus feminists and codified in Roe v. Wade,\u201d and spread the Islamophobic myth that Gen. John Pershing executed Muslim prisoners in the Philippines in 1913 with bullets dipped in pig fat.\n\nAsked about the Pershing article in Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Menashi said he wrote it some 20 years ago (he was a public affairs fellow at the Hoover Institution at the time) and believed back then that the offensive anecdote was true, only to discover in later years that it was not.\n\n\u201cI regret having repeated it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two Democratic senators from New York, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, put out a statement later on Wednesday trashing Menashi\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cIt is clear from Steven Menashi\u2019s long, disturbing record that he is the wrong candidate to serve on the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York,\u201d they said. \u201cHis views are far outside the judicial mainstream and completely out of step with the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers. His confirmation to the federal judiciary would threaten the rights of millions of Americans, and we strongly urge our colleagues to oppose the Menashi nomination.\u201d\n\nThe hallway protesters, who were with the progressive groups Demand Justice and Center for Popular Democracy, were on day two of demonstrating against Trump\u2019s court picks. They stormed four senators\u2019 offices on Tuesday to confront them on their support for judicial nominees who had declined to say whether they thought Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. They also visited Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, to deliver petitions with 110,000 signatures from opponents of Menashi\u2019s confirmation and to urge her to lead the effort to tank his nomination.\n\nFeinstein signaled Wednesday that she hadn\u2019t appreciated their visit.\n\nWhen Graham opened the hearing, he noted that two of the offices crashed by protesters the day before belonged to other committee members \u2015 Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) \u2015 and said those senators were \u201cbasically threatened.\u201d (That is not what happened.)\n\n\u201cTo those trying to take our committee away from us and trying to take our judgment away from us ... I think it will serve us well to stick together and fight back,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cI very much agree with those comments,\u201d Feinstein replied.", "description": "The controversial judicial nominee angered Republicans and Democrats by not addressing the work he's done for Trump.", "authors": ["Senior Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d794f923b00002a74d0e586.jpeg?cache=l8erbj7z6n&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
