There have been plenty of embarrassing losses and dysfunctional moments since then, to be sure, but owner Dan Snyder has resisted making drastic changes until the season ended.\n\nYet, after a humiliating 31-15 loss Monday against the Chicago Bears \u2014 with his team looking hapless and hopeless en route to an 0-3 record \u2014 it was only natural to wonder if coach Jay Gruden\u2019s job was in immediate danger.\n\nGruden\u2019s seat has never been hotter as the Redskins now turn to face the New York Giants next week at MetLife Stadium.\n\nBut asked Tuesday if he considers his job status week-to-week at this point, the sixth-year coach said no.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t felt like that,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBut who knows? I\u2019m just trying to concentrate on the Giants right now, put our best foot forward, learn from our mistakes here and try to get better. That\u2019s all we\u2019re trying to do here as a staff and go from there.\u201d\n\nFor the third straight week, Gruden stressed he believes his team can turn its season around. He told reporters that he is not considering making changes to his coaching staff, which includes keeping Greg Manusky as Washington\u2019s defensive coordinator.\n\nGruden, too, stuck by Case Keenum \u2014 despite the quarterback\u2019s five turnovers against Chicago.\n\nBut for the Redskins to salvage their season, Washington will need to improve substantially. Through three games, the Redskins ranks 30th in points allowed and has the worst third-down defense in the league at 63.4%. Even more embarrassing, quarterbacks have completed an astonishing 79% of their passes against Washington.\n\nGruden and the Redskins are confident a turnaround is possible, saying there\u2019s still a lot of football left.\n\nWhen Gruden watched the film of Monday\u2019s loss, he observed his team missing \u201cgreat opportunities.\u201d He also saw his team refuse to quit, cutting a 28-0 Bears lead to a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat, he said, showed heart.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of fight in these guys,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThey have a lot of pride. They want to win. They want to do whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nGruden\u2019s answers won\u2019t please everybody. Fans are fed up with the lack of winning, and Washington has lost nine of its last 10 dating back to last season. They\u2019re tired of the Redskins being thrashed on national TV: They have lost eight straight appearances on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d and are 5-17 in prime-time games in the last six years. They want better results.\n\nThis situation facing Gruden isn\u2019t entirely new. Throughout his six-year tenure, Gruden has navigated questions about his job status. Back in May, the coach joked about being fired if the Redskins failed to make the playoffs, a nod to the fact they haven\u2019t made the postseason since the 2015 campaign.\n\nBut the pressure hasn\u2019t been quite like this.\n\nESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith called for Gruden\u2019s job Tuesday on the debate show \u201cFirst Take.\u201d Fans tweeted \u201c#FireJayGruden\u201d after Washington\u2019s loss. The coach took criticism for not turning to rookie Dwayne Haskins in light of Keenum\u2019s performance, as well.\n\nGruden will have to prove he can get the Redskins to perform better.\n\n\u201cThis season is not lost,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not over. I know everybody wants to say, \u2018It\u2019s over and the season is over so go ahead and play Haskins.\u2019 We feel confident we can turn this thing around. I\u2019m out here at practice every day. We\u2019re out here at practice every day evaluating everybody.\n\n\u201cIf we feel like Dwayne gives us the best chance to win in a coming game, we\u2019ll definitely put Dwayne in there. If we feel like it\u2019s Colt [McCoy] when he gets healthy, it could be Colt. Right now, we feel like it\u2019s Case Keenum and we\u2019re going to move forward with him this week.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
