Cinema Group)\n\nMuch like the female protagonist of Witchboard, the deliciously cheesy 1986 cautionary tale about why you should never use an Ouija board improperly, I have an obsession. But I\u2019m not obsessed with talking to ghosts. I\u2019m just obsessed with Witchboard.\n\nThe feature debut of writer-director Kevin Tenney \u2014 whose second film, 1988's Night of the Demons, is also a cult classic \u2014 Witchboard is not exactly the movie you might picture when you consider its key elements: sinister party games, a ghostly kid, gory murders, a woman pushed to the brink of madness. It often feels way more like melodrama than horror; it spends a lot of time wringing its hands over the love triangle between the three main characters, who include Brandon (Stephen Nichols), a yuppie who knows an awful lot about the supernatural for some reason; rugged regular-dude Jim (Todd Allen), who thinks all this spirit-realm business is bullshit; and law student Linda (Tawny Kitaen), whose innocent supernatural dabbling spells trouble for everyone.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Brandon and Jim were childhood BFFs who drifted apart, only to become present-day enemies when Jim started dating Linda, who happens to be Brandon\u2019s ex. (That said, Jim and Brandon have more chemistry together than either of them do with Linda.) So it\u2019s already messy even before Brandon shows up to Linda and Jim\u2019s house party carrying a Ouija board (snootily correcting the pronunciation of someone who says \u201cweejee\u201d by pointing out the name comes from \u201cyes\u201d in French and German: \u201coui\u201d and \u201cja\u201d). Things take a turn for the bizarre when the spirit he summons \u2014 the 10-year-old \u201cDavid\u201d \u2014 proves mischievous. When Linda starts using the Ouija by herself, accompanied only by her meticulously manicured 1980s talons, David\u2019s bad vibes become dangerous.\n\nThe Hardy Boys.\n\nCan Brandon (a true believer) and Jim (who has a hard time accepting that spooks are involved, despite some rather compelling evidence) put their differences aside when Linda begins showing signs of possession? Will Witchboard briefly morph into a buddy comedy/road trip movie so they can rekindle their friendship while playing at being occult detectives? Obviously.\n\nIn truth, most people remember Witchboard solely because it features Kitaen, whose greatest claim to fame is probably her turn as a hood ornament in Whitesnake\u2019s \u201cHere I Go Again\u201d video, an inescapable MTV staple back in the day. While her Witchboard character is a bit more demure (aside from one gratuitous shower scene \u2014 in a movie where the dudes are often unnecessarily shirtless, too), her voluminous hair is already primed for Headbangers Ball. Really, everyone in the movie has a rockin\u2019 coif \u2014 there are mullets galore, and a gum-snapping medium (Kathleen Wilhoit) who breezes through for a s\u00e9ance scene has a punky New Wave short cut.\n\nEvery day is a good hair day for Tawny Kitaen.\n\nDespite its totally 1980s setting (and that all that glorious hair), unlike some other vintage films, Witchboard doesn\u2019t constantly jerk you out of the movie with period elements. Nobody goes to Jazzercise and, aside from the medium\u2019s Valley Girl affect, there\u2019s no wacky \u201880s slang. That said, contemporary viewers will notice that the entire story is propelled by things that would take less than a minute to handle in 2019. Characters drive for hours to check microfilm at a specific town\u2019s local library, run into bookstores to do urgent fact-finding, page through the phone book to track down strangers, use payphones and answering machines, etc. etc. That pacing\u2019s actually kind of perfect, given all the screen time spent watching a planchette gliding around a Ouija board, slowwwwwly spelling out clues the audience has already figured out long before the characters.\n\nBut Witchboard, which was obviously made on a shoestring, has just enough weirdness to make up for its absolute lack of any actual scares \u2014 there are multiple \u201cjump scares\u201d when someone spots themselves in a mirror; at one point, the disembodied David pours ketchup over a butcher knife in a scene that\u2019s meant to create a grisly tableaux \u2014 to make you see why it\u2019s become a cult favourite. The uneven performances add some unintentional humour, especially anytime anyone is is called upon to burst into a sudden fit of rage, but the characters are all kind of endearing, even Brandon, who\u2019s presented initially as kind of a classic 1980s villain, with his expensive suit and vanity plate-emblazoned sports car, but is actually a total paranormal nerd.\n\nKathleen Wilhoit also had a memorable role in 1989\"s Road House.\n\nThe supporting characters are also notably offbeat \u2014 obviously the quirky medium, who cracks \u201cpsychic humour\u201d jokes with terrible timing, is memorable, but so\u2019s the detective who starts to suspect, incorrectly, Jim is up to something. He\u2019s randomly obsessed with magicians, and we know this because he brings it up nearly every time he appears, including misattributing a Vegas show to the great \u201cSigmund and Roy.\u201d Show biz legend Rose Marie also pops up as Jim and Linda\u2019s landlady. Even the sprawling house where Jim and Linda have their apartment is noteworthy \u2014 it\u2019s also used in 1988's Waxwork, which stars Gremlins\u2019 Zach Galligan and is yet another cult movie to add to your rainy-day pile.\n\nAside from casting Tawny Kitaen, Witchboard\u2019s greatest contribution to cinema is probably that it will appear on any general list of movies featuring a Ouija board. It\u2019s not going to change your life or anything, but it\u2019s silly supernatural fun, and you might just find yourself watching it on repeat for no good reason.
