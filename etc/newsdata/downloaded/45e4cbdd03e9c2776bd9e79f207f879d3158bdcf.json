Their conditions were not immediately available.\n\nOne person suffered a seizure and another injured his hand in an attempt to escape, Mr Battiste said. It was not clear whether they were among those who had been shot.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

A motive for the shooting was not immediately known.\n\nStudents were gathered at Ladd-Peebles Stadium on Friday night for a game between LeFlore High School and Williamson High School when the gunfire erupted.\n\nFootage from the game on social media showed attendees and football players getting on the ground and taking cover under the bleachers as screams were heard in the background. \u201cWhy are young people bringing this type of violence to public events?\u201d Mr Battiste said during the news conference. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing their beefs that they have with each other in neighbourhoods, and they are putting other people in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nThe safety policy on the website of Ladd-Peebles Stadium prohibits weapons, including firearms, knives and box cutters in the stadium, regardless of a permit. A clear-bag policy is in effect for major events like University of South Alabama games; it was unclear whether high school football games fell under that category. Mr Battiste said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that a mass shooting had occurred in Mobile. \u201cThis is juvenile violence taken to a public venue for the purpose of harming somebody in a public setting,\u201d he said.", "description": "A shooting at a high school football game in Mobile, Alabama, on Friday night wounded at least 10 people, police said.
