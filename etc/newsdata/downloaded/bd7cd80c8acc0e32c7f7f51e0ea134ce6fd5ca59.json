But, recognizing it as hardly \u201ca swing state,\u2019\u2019 Parscale still pointed to California \u2014 a bastion of fundraising, voter contact operations and volunteer firepower \u2014 as a lynchpin in \u201cthe fight for the future of this country,\u2019\u2019 he said, predicting that \u201cthe Trumps will be a dynasty that lasts for decades.\u201d\n\nAsked later if he believes the Trump children represent future candidates, Pascale said: \u201cI just think they\u2019re a dynasty. I think they\u2019re all amazing people...with amazing capabilities. I think you see that from Don Jr. I think you see that from Ivanka. You see it from Jared. You see it from all.\u201d\n\nHe also wouldn\u2019t respond to reporters\u2019 questions about whether the president would campaign for candidates in California.\n\nFor party leaders and grassroots volunteers alike, a key goal of this weekend\u2019s session is to lay the groundwork to retake those House seats. | Chris Carlson/AP Photo\n\nIn his speech, Parscale promised GOP loyalists that the Trump Victory Leadership Initiative here would marshall highly sophisticated technology, including use of artificial intelligence which he said would provide more information than ever before on \u201cwho the voters are, where they live, how they consume information \u2014 and how to contact them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the potential to win back eight Congressional seats back to Republicans here in California,\u2019\u2019 Parscale said. He noted that effort alone could bring 50 paid staff to the state in 2020, making it potentially \u201cthe largest election day operations\u2019 in state history.\n\nStill, he advised GOP loyalists that regarding the party\u2019s future, \u201cthe answer is not me \u2014 it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the California GOP,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no trick I can do on my laptop that you can\u2019t do yourselves. It takes hard work, and talking to your neighbors. And with a strong leader with President Trump at the helm \u2014 the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, the Latina mother of two who was elected earlier this year to chair the embattled state GOP, called the scope of the party\u2019s training efforts \u201chistoric\u201d and said California\u2019s Republican Party is now heavily invested in \u201cengagement\u201d \u2014 she rejects the word \u201coutreach\u201d as insufficiently energizing \u2014 in an acknowledgment that party must return to the drawing board to attract fresh blood for what she called a \u201cCalifornia Republican Comeback.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infrastructure...new message, new messengers,\u2019\u2019 Patterson said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a good foundation, we\u2019re not going to be able to build on top of it.\u2019\u2019 Already, she\u2019s celebrating a payoff, telling delegates this weekend that \u201cwe\u2019ve recruited 20,000 new volunteers,\u2019\u2019 doubled the party\u2019s grassroots email and reached 1.4 million voters \u2014 in the last month alone.\n\nEducation researcher and former Bush adviser Bill Evers, looking around the room at the smiling faces after party faithful heard upbeat stump speeches from a crowd of House candidates from Orange County \u2014 a former GOP bastion that this year became majority Democratic \u2014 said that the optimism was contagious.\n\n\u201cThis is a party in pretty good spirits,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThis is not a party that feels down...they think the quality of their candidates is good, they\u2019re raising money \u2014 and the fight is on. They want to turn this thing around.\u201d\n\nBut the state GOP\u2019s efforts come at a time when the party faces formidable roadblocks. Polls show Donald Trump is historically unpopular with voters here, and he has been the subject of nearly 60 lawsuits from state leaders challenging his moves on issues ranging from auto emissions to immigration.\n\nCalifornia Playbook newsletter Our must-read briefing on politics and government in the Golden State.

Arnold Schwarzenegger co-founded New Way California, an effort to moderate the party \u2014 introduced a plank in the party\u2019s platform formally stating the GOP\u2019s object to intolerance and racism. His move, though viewed as likely to pass in a vote Sunday, was seen by some as a clear jab at the president and was denounced by one Tea Party activist \u201cas popular as a stink bomb in an elevator.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut Mayes wasn\u2019t alone here in expressing his concerns that in becoming the \u201cparty of Trump,\u2019\u2019 the state GOP has all but ensured its destruction in California, a state that is home to the largest number of immigrants and a fast-growing Latino electorate.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s leadership, \u201cless and less people continue to participate. The diversity of thought in conversation has also disappeared,\u2019\u2019 says longtime GOP strategist Luis Alvarado, who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 \u2014 and vows to reject him again in 2020.\n\n\u201cNo one can actually point to anything this administration has done effectively. Everything has been geared towards nationalism and partisanship,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere is no way anyone can agree that this president is a president for all the people.\u201d\n\nBut Harmeet Dhillon and Shawn Steel, California\u2019s two representatives on the Republican National Committee, say the weekend\u2019s popular training sessions \u2014 all closed to media and packed to capacity with party activists \u2014 are evidence that the California GOP \u201c2.0\u201d reboot is working.\n\n\u201cHalf of our board of directors are under 40,\u2019\u2019 and many of them immigrants or minorities, says Dhillon, an attorney and former state party vice chair who is herself a devout Sikh who immigrated from India. \u201cIt\u2019s a different generation and it\u2019s very diverse, and they\u2019re bringing a different perspective with what they care about \u2014 digital tools and other things.\u201d\n\nSteel, a former party chair, says his wife, Orange County Supervisor Michelle Park Steel \u2014 a Korean immigrant now challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Harley Rouda in an effort to retake the congressional seat once held by Dana Rohrabacher \u2014 is emblematic of the party\u2019s vanguard of new candidates.\n\n\u201cIn some of these house races and legislative seats, many of our candidates are Asian American \u2014 and the Democrats are running old white guys,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally flipped.\u201d\n\nPark Steel is only one example of what party leaders are calling an \u201cembarrassment of riches\u201d in the ethnically diverse array of candidates who have lined up for the 2020 cycle even as the state party in recent years has grown older and whiter.\n\nAmong them are Young Kim, the first Korean American to serve in the state legislature and now a candidate for the congressional seat held by Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros; Angela Underwood Jacobs, an African American city councilwoman from Lancaster and Mike Garcia, a former Navy pilot, both hoping to unseat Democratic Rep. Katie Hill in eastern Los Angeles and Ventura County.\n\nAlso a party priority, according to NRCC executive director Parker Poling, is the campaign of former Congressman David Valadao; she told GOP delegates he has a double digit lead and is on track to retake his congressional seat from Democratic Rep. T.J. Cox, who unseated him in 2018.\n\nDhillon says she\u2019s convinced that Republicans have a winning message for California, the world\u2019s fifth largest economy. \u201cThe economy is moving and there are job opportunities at every level for people of every color and gender...and what are the Democrats selling?\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThe world is going to end in 12 years. Climate change as a religion. Abortion in the ninth month. These are not mainstream positions, even on the left. It\u2019s a turnoff.\u201d\n\nPatterson told activists this weekend that Republicans can reboot and win because California Democrats only offer \u201cfailed leadership\u201d in a state on a \u201cdownward spiral.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are \u201carrogant, complacent and cocky\u2019\u2019 about homelessness, taxation and housing affordability in the state, she said at one point, adding \u2014 in a veiled reference to Trump \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s no wonder that Democrat politicians want to talk about tweets and, frankly, anything other than their record of failure.\u2019\u2019", "description": "At the California GOP convention, the president\u2019s campaign manager tells delegates they have an important role to play in 2020.", "authors": ["Carla Marinucci"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/66/d7/165d73df4d8ca8b0f5a7f7fa173a/1987-parscale-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
