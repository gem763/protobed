It will be accompanied by unspecified commitments on intellectual property and currency and will go some way to repairing the damage done to U.S. agriculture since tit-for-tat tariffs began more than 18 months ago.\n\nTogether, the package will calm markets and reduce fears of looming trade-driven recessions in the U.S. and global economies, even if Trump said Friday the two sides had yet to commit a deal to paper that he expects he and China\u2019s Xi Jinping will sign in Chile a month from now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bigger than what we are doing with China,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday.\n\nBut even if it gels in the way that Trump outlined Friday, the agreement is far smaller in scope than what the president himself once envisioned, or what was on the table when talks broke down in May.\n\nIt also leaves major questions hanging in the wind amid a broader relationship showing plenty of signs of souring -- ranging from the Chinese furor over an NBA executive\u2019s backing for the growing protests in Hong Kong to the administration\u2019s invocation for the first time this week of human rights to crack down on Chinese tech companies and visas for officials.\n\n\u201cThis deal hardly resolves any of the major underlying sources of trade and economic frictions between the two countries,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China team now at Cornell University.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s justified skepticism about whether even a mini-deal will get done. Officials said it will take three to five weeks to finalize the details. Past negotiations have broken down in less time than that.\u201d\n\nTom Orlik and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg Economics\n\nRead the full note here\n\nThe contours of the deal unveiled Friday look very similar to ones negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and even Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that were rejected by Trump over the past two years, said Wendy Cutler, a longtime former U.S. trade negotiator who now heads the Asia Society Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cIt looks more like a \u2018light\u2019 deal than a \u2018substantial\u2019 deal,\u201d Cutler said, and remains at risk of being weakened further as negotiators put it down on paper in the weeks to come.\n\nAfter months of escalation, Trump compromised this week and offered a tacit embrace of something he has resisted for months: A partial deal that might yet grow into something more comprehensive but could take as many as three separate phases of negotiations.\n\n\u201cDoing it in sections and phases I think is, really, better,\u201d Trump said Friday, after as recently as last week saying he would agree only to a big deal.\n\nThat change in strategy reflects a reality that many analysts have warned of from the beginning of Trump\u2019s attack on China. While Trump has steadily increased pressure on China with his tariffs, the Chinese have always been reluctant to embrace the wholesale economic changes Trump has demanded.\n\n\u201cThere is still a yawning gap that separates the two sides on core structural issues,\u201d said Prasad.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the deal unveiled Friday does not include the game changer the Trump administration once promised would be a foundation of any deal with China: an enforcement mechanism to make sure that Beijing does not renege on its commitments. Trump would offer only that it would be worked out later.\n\nIt was quickly noticed on Capitol Hill. \u201cAfter so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,\u201d said Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the party\u2019s leading voice on trade in the Senate.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- With the partial agreement with China that he announced Friday, President Donald Trump is back in dealmaker mode after months of escalation.That doesn\u2019t mean, though, that the new grand bargain that Trump once promised with China is any more than a small step closer to reality, or that", "authors": ["Shawn Donnan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VJm.l2i0YfIlVrtc4QFKJw--~B/aD03MDg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/504d26e79eebee664526a74294bcb556", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
