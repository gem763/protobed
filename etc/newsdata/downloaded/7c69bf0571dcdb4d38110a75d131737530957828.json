In early 2016 this was a $2 stock. In the 44 months since then, AMD stock has increased by more than 15-fold to over $30.\n\nSource: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe ride from $2 to $15 hasn\u2019t always been smooth, but it has taken a spectacular ride higher that has produced a 1,400% gain in AMD stock.\n\nRight now, AMD stock is going through one of those bumpy patches. Escalation of the U.S-China trade war in August has weighed on AMD stock. From late July to early September, AMD stock shed 7% amid broader market turbulence and chip stock woes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis pain in Advanced Micro Devices stock is temporary for two big reasons. First, the trade war won\u2019t last forever \u2014 instead, tensions should deescalate from here into the end of 2019. Second, AMD\u2019s secular market share expansion narrative \u2014 which has been the fuel for the stock\u2019s 1,400% rally since early 2016 \u2014 remains alive and well.\n\nAs such, near-term trade war weakness will pass. When it does, it will be replaced by long-term market expansion strength \u2014 meaning the smart thing to do with AMD stock is to stay the course.\n\nNear-Term Trade War Weakness Will Pass\n\nThe first big reason to stay the course with AMD stock is because near-term trade war weakness will inevitably pass, and probably soon.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, the U.S.-China trade war has followed a rather predictable cycle. The two countries will have negotiation talks, and comment favorably on those talks. Markets rally in response. Then, one country basically breaks from the talks, and says the talks aren\u2019t going well. Sometimes that break is accompanied by more tariffs. Markets drop in response. After that, the two countries get back to negotiation talks, and again comment favorably on those talks. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nRight now, we are a month into the part where the countries break from the talks and throw down a new round of tariffs. History says that within the next month or so, the two countries will comment favorably on trade talk progress, potentially even remove or delay tariffs, and markets will rebound.\n\nThe fundamentals also line up with this idea. If you zoom out, neither the U.S. nor China wants the trade war to get much uglier in the near term. China\u2019s economy is rapidly slowing, and China has consistently prided itself in having one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Elevated trade tensions will only further weigh on China\u2019s economy in the near term.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is heading into an election year, and U.S. President Donald Trump has consistently tied the success of his presidency to the success of the U.S. economy and stock market. Elevated trade tensions will only dampen the U.S. economy and markets for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs such, over then next 12 to 16 months, neither side really wants to up the trade war ante all that much. If anything, both sides have an incentive to put the trade war on hold for the next 12 to 16 months, and then resume talks after the 2020 election and once China\u2019s economy stabilizes.\n\nFor all these reasons, I think that today\u2019s elevated trade tensions will dramatically cool over the next few months. As they do, AMD stock should move higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMD\u2019s Market Share Expansion Narrative Remains Robust\n\nThe second big reason to stay the course with AMD stock is because the company\u2019s secular market share expansion narrative remains as robust as ever.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back. The big rally in Advanced Micro Devices stock from $2 in early 2016, to $30 in mid-2019, has been powered almost exclusively by one thing: market share expansion. Long story short, AMD is a small company operating in some very large markets. Those very large markets have produced the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) \u2014 two companies with $100 billion-plus market caps.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been one of the hottest stocks for over three years now.
