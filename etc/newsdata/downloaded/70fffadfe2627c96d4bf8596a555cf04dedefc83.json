And I enjoyed everything that goes on. I mean, if you think about the five principles of Mars, you know, you teach those every single day of your life.\"\n\nAnd those five principles are? \"Quality. Mutuality. Responsibility. Freedom. Oh, my God, I forgot.\"\n\n\"Brush your teeth?\" suggested Burbank. \"I'm pretty sure that's the fifth one.\"\n\nThey're principles set down by Franklin C. Mars way back in 1920 when he founded the company. Things started slow, but the business landed a hit in 1923 with the Milky Way Bar. Then came Snickers and M&Ms, and the rest, as they say, is candy history.\n\nMore than a century later, the company is still owned entirely by the Mars family, who \u2013 like Willy Wonka himself \u2013 are as notoriously secretive as they are successful. Mars is one of the largest privately-held companies in the world, with $35 billion (according to Forbes) in sales each year.\n\nAccording to Amy Vedmore, the factory's site director, \"We make about 99% of the Snickers fun size. We make Milky Way and Three Musketeers fun size as well.\"\n\nIn all, millions of tiny candy bars come out of this facility each day, as well as some regular-sized bars, which, after being made, need to be packed and shipped.\n\nAs Burbank found out, it looks easy, but after just five minutes on the production line he had a newfound empathy for Lucille Ball.\n\nOf course, how you package the chocolate doesn't mean much, if it doesn't taste right. Burbank met Lindsay Garfield, who is principal sensory technologist. In other words, her job is to eat candy, making sure that every piece that comes out of this factory tastes perfect.\n\n\"We say the perfect Snickers is the same Snickers that the first Snickers tasted like,\" Garfield said.\n\n\"The first Snickers bar that Mr. Mars presumably, like, invented?\" asked Burbank.\n\n\"The perfect Snickers!\"\n\n\"And does anyone know what that one tasted like?\"\n\n\"It tastes just like the Snickers today,\" Garfield replied.\n\nSo, what is involved in testing a candy bar's flavor? Burbank have his taste buds a try. \"Okay, so we're tasting this cocoa butter because it's one of the building blocks of a Milky Way essentially, right? How does one properly taste cocoa butter?\"\n\n\"With cocoa butter you're gonna wanna slurp it,\" Garfield said. \"So, pretend like you're the rudest person in the world.\"\n\n\"Not hard for me!\"\n\n\"You should get chocolate \u2013 chocolate should be your number one thing you should get. And then just that oily mouth feel.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm getting both of those things,\" Burbank said. \"So, this was a success!\"\n\nBurbank then tried his hand at giving away candy for free. Hard to mess up, as Willa May Brown can tell you. Around here, she's known as the \"Queen of Halloween\" for her role in giving away mass quantities of free candy to thousands who turn up in front of the candy factory every October 31.\n\n\"I mean, we give 'em gobs of candy,\" Brown said. \"And we have two tables, and we have four people at each table. And everybody puts somethin' in their bag.\"\n\nBurbank asked, \"Now, is there an age cutoff for this? Like, do you have to be a kid?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nAnd do more kids or adults come for Free Candy Day? \"More adults, believe it or not,\" she replied.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nMars Wrigley Candy, Oak Park, Ill.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory produced by Amy Wall.", "description": "For nearly a century the Mars Wrigley company has been making candy treats that have filled kids' Halloween stashes \u2013 and adults', too", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/27/e84abde5-1093-4421-b775-4ebcda24918f/thumbnail/1200x630/af3ad7b420b94c2b83f3035aef4e5fd0/mars-candy-a-cam-29-frame-1852.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
