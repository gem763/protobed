I was serving well and that took some of the extra pressure away.\n\n\"Sometimes it's tough to manage the energy. But getting angry sometimes can actually help. It can give you an extra reason to fight.\"\n\nThe ATP Finals' hopes of David Goffin stalled as the sixth seed lost to Reilly Opelka 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/4), 7-5, with the young American sending down 29 aces in two and a half hours.\n\nGoffin stands provisional tenth in the race to the eight-man season wrap-up with a final points-earning chance next week at the Paris Masters.\n\nRafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Federer, Daniil Medvedev, Dominic Thiem and Tsitsipas have already booked their places in the ATP Finals, leaving just two places available.\n\nRoberto Bautista Agut, who sits one spot away from a London invitation, stayed in the chase as he defeated France's Richard Gasquet 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 and will next play Opelka.\n\nThe Spaniard claimed his 40th victory of the season as he works to become a first-time qualifier into the season showpiece in London which starts on November 10.", "description": "Stan Wawrinka scored an emotional win over Frances Tiafoe 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 on Thursday to set up a quarter-final with compatriot and close friend Roger Federer at the ATP Swiss Indoors.
