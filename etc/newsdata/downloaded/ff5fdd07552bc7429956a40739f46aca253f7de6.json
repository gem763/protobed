Bernstein accused him not of sexual harassment but of belligerent, bullying behavior, including storming into the newsroom to scream at her.\n\nAt home, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s temper was no less a problem.\n\nAccording to court documents from his vicious custody battle with ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy, O\u2019Reilly may have engaged in domestic violence. As Gawker reported at the time, the ex-couple\u2019s teenage daughter told a court-appointed forensic examiner that she witnessed O\u2019Reilly \u201cchoking her mom\u201d as he \u201c\u2018dragged her down some stairs\u2019 by the neck.\u201d O\u2019Reilly had told his daughter that her mother was an \u201cadulterer,\u201d according to court transcripts, and that he struggled to stop himself from \u201cgoing ballistic\u201d around his family.\n\nMeanwhile, the sexual-harassment allegations from co-workers continued to pour in. As the Times unearthed last month, former Fox Business Network anchor Rebecca Gomez Diamond had also secretly recorded phone calls in which O\u2019Reilly made unwanted advances on her.\n\nWhen Fox News decided not to renew her contract in 2011, Diamond and her lawyers outlined their case against O\u2019Reilly and he reportedly paid out an undisclosed amount to settle it.\n\nIn 2016, after Fox News chief Ailes was ousted for his own alleged sexual-harassment of women, former anchor Laurie Dhue outline sexual-harassment complaints against both O\u2019Reilly and Ailes. Dhue walked away with a reported settlement from 21st Century Fox worth more than $1 million.\n\nAround the same time, former regular Factor guest Juliet Huddy received a $1.6-million settlement, over complaints that O\u2019Reilly had pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 while in control of her airtime, according to the Times. Her lawyers told Fox News that at one point the O\u2019Reilly tried to kiss her, and when she pulled away and fell to the ground, he refused to assist her. He then allegedly worked to \u201cblunt her career prospects,\u201d the Times added.\n\nAnother former regular guest, Wendy Walsh, recently accused O\u2019Reilly of propositioning her in 2013 to come up to his Los Angeles hotel suite after a dinner in which he promised to help her obtain a contributor deal with Fox News.\n\nAfter Walsh said she rebuffed his advances, O\u2019Reilly allegedly became irate, threatening her career, and even insulting her black leather purse. Though she continued to appear on the show for several more months, Walsh recalled feeling her Fox News career prospects slipping away. She never became a Fox News contributor.\n\nOn Monday, another accuser, represented by lawyer Lisa Bloom claimed O\u2019Reilly called her \u201chot chocolate\u201d (she is black) and would grunt and leer at her in the workplace.\n\nAdditionally, former Fox News commentator Andrea Tantaros, who is in the middle of a legal battle with the network over alleged Ailes harassment, claimed in her lawsuit that O\u2019Reilly had made unwanted advances on her, including inviting her out to his Long Island home where he said it would be \u201cvery private.\u201d\n\nThe conservative pundit\u2019s therapist backed the claims, recalling \u201ca number of occasions when Andrea complained to me about recurring unwanted advances from Bill O\u2019Reilly.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly has vociferously denied all of the accusations made against him, with his lawyer often issuing overwrought statements about how the volcanic host \u201chas been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America.\u201d\n\nBut with Ailes gone and the younger sons of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch asserting greater control of the company, O\u2019Reilly has no one left to protect him.\n\nBill-O can rest easy, however, knowing he has one defender: President Donald Trump, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong.\u201d", "description": "A confluence of advertiser boycotts and newly unearthed sexual-harassment cases brought him down\u2014but his troubling alleged behavior towards women has gone on for decades.", "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492635987/articles/2017/04/19/choking-harassing-and-loofahs-women-s-allegations-against-bill-o-reilly-piled-up-for-years-before-his-demise/170417-Kirell-O-Reilly-tease_pja9k6", "published_at": "2017-04-19"}
