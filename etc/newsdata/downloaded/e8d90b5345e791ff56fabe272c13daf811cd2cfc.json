It's the largest strike by any union against any business since the last strike at GM in 2007.\n\nThe strike started at 11:59 pm Sunday night. The two sides did not formally meet Sunday after the union declared its intention to strike at a morning press conference, although union spokesman Brian Rothenberg said that the dialogue between the two sides was ongoing. A new meeting of the two sides is set for 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nThe union said that GM was putting profits ahead of employees who helped to turn the company around when it went through bankruptcy and federal bailout a decade ago.\n\nThe company said it made a substantial offer that includes improved pay and profit sharing for union members, along with investment to bring new jobs. It also promised a \"solution\" for two of the four plants currently slated for closure: one in Detroit and another in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nRead More", "description": "The United Auto Workers union went out on strike against General Motors Sunday night, the first work stoppage in the US auto industry in 12 years.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190916120412-gm-employee-signs-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
