Lynch mobs, arsonists, bomb makers, lone gunman.\"\n\n\"And as we all now realize, this violence does not live in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"Those of us who are white try, but we can never fully, fully, understand no matter how hard we try.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the legacy of slavery remains in the US, saying: \"We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American Dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden at the the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, on September 15, 2019.
