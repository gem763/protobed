From the shares\u2019 peak in early 2013, while her predecessor\u2019s initiatives were still in motion, the IBM stock price has fallen 33%.\n\n9 Stocks That Every 20-Year-Old Should Buy More\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe performance of IBM stock, of course, merely reflects the company\u2019s financial performance. Its revenue peaked in 2011, and its profits peaked in the following year. Although IBM has managed to occasionally grow its top and bottom lines, they have continued to decline in the longer term.\n\nThere\u2019s one underlying reason why IBM has failed to grow, causing International Business Machines stock to struggle, in an environment where seemingly every other technology giant has managed to do so. That is, the company is offering the wrong products at the wrong time at the wrong price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe more nuanced answer, however, is that Rometty, its CEO, isn\u2019t getting the job done.\n\nMissed Opportunities\n\nGinni Rometty is a well-polished executive who says all the right things, impresses in public forums, and has avoided the type of scandals that generally lead to CEOs being removed from their position.\n\nShe\u2019s also been a loyal IBM employee, starting with the company in 1981 as a ground-level systems analyst. No one can deny she\u2019s earned her way to the company\u2019s top spot, having done many of the jobs other IBM employees are doing now.\n\nBut she\u2019s been calling the shots for eight years. That\u2019s an eight-year stretch during which Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the world\u2019s cloud-computing leader \u2026 a business the e-commerce giant arguably had no business getting into. During the same eight years, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became a go-to provider of artificial intelligence hardware, a business it practically stumbled into, at first.\n\nIn both sectors, IBM could have made a big dent. Instead, it put out more more-of-the-same mainframes, and a Watson AI platform that hasn\u2019t always been impressive. Indeed, Watson has been frequently criticized as not being \u201creal\u201d artificial intelligence.\n\nRometty didn\u2019t program the AI algorithms that Watson utilizes, nor did she assemble the hardware that runs it.\n\nShe absolutely could have pushed the company in different directions, though.\n\nInternational Business Machines Is Out of Touch\n\nThe balance between the experience that tends to come with age and the understanding of \u201cnew\u201d that tends to come with youth is a tricky one. Both are needed in the workplace, though how much of each is needed can vary as time passes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps those critics who argue the 62-year-old Rometty isn\u2019t quite plugged into the pulse of the tech world have a valid point.\n\nMeanwhile,asWill Ashworth pointed out last month, the average age of IBM\u2019s board members is 64.\n\nThe internet didn\u2019t even become popularized until more than a decade after they graduated from college. Cloud computing didn\u2019t proliferate until more than a couple of decades after they graduated from college. Smartphones weren\u2019t widely popular until nearly three decades after they got out of college.\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest that anyone over the age of 30 can\u2019t learn about newer technologies. They can, and do.\n\nBut the internet and cloud computing are now the centerpieces of how we live our lives, centerpieces that most people under the age of 30 don\u2019t remember living without. It\u2019s a cultural component that a group of people in their 60s can never fully understand.\n\nConsequently, it\u2019s likely this group of older adults \u2014 the Board of Directors and Rometty \u2014 are guilty of collectively misunderstanding the tech world and today\u2019s companies, and then supporting one another\u2019s misunderstandings.\n\nThere\u2019s also a decent-sized chance that Rometty\u2019s 38 years with IBM are more of a liability than a benefit. After almost four decades of absorbing the same corporate culture, bad habits and a misguided vision of the future become extremely ingrained.", "description": "In the nearly-eight years Ginni Rometty has served as CEO of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), IBM stock has lost 23% of its value.
