GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares cheered by U.S. jobs data but traders fear trade talks\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Fall in U.S. jobless rate pushes stocks higher\n\n* Unrest in Hong Kong could weigh on market sentiment\n\n* Investors are cautious before U.S.-China trade talks\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on Monday\n\nafter data showed the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to the\n\nlowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the\n\nworld's largest economy.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nrose 0.16%. Australian shares were up\n\n0.63%. Japan's Nikkei stock index opened higher but\n\nreversed course and fell 0.2%.\n\nThe pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were up 0.2%\n\nat 3,435, German DAX futures were up 0.18%, while FTSE\n\nfutures were down 0.03%.\n\nU.S. stock futures, fell 0.39% in Asia on Monday\n\nafter the S&P 500 surged 1.4% on Friday.\n\nThe offshore yuan CNH fell around 0.3% to 7.1337 to the\n\ndollar after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are\n\nsignalling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad\n\ntrade deal pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump. There was no onshore yuan trading, as Monday is the last day\n\nof a long China holiday for its national day.\n\nThe media report also pushed up safe-haven assets such as\n\ngold and the yen.\n\nCrude oil futures pared losses to trade little changed amid\n\ncaution about a resolution to the trade dispute.\n\nSentiment toward the U.S. economy deteriorated sharply much\n\nof last week after disappointing data on manufacturing and\n\nservices suggested the trade war was taking a toll, and more\n\nrate cuts would be needed to avert a potential recession in the\n\nworld's biggest economy.\n\nBut a modest September increase in U.S. jobs, announced on\n\nFriday, eased some of these concerns and lifted U.S. markets\n\nthat day. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September\n\nto reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also\n\ngrew in September, but slightly less than expected. \"Moderate job growth and subdued inflation in the United\n\nStates is a positive for stocks,\" said Shusuke Yamada, head of\n\nFX and Japan equity strategy at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities\n\nin Tokyo.\n\nThis week, the main focus will be the high-level U.S.-China\n\ntrade negotiations expected in Washington on Oct. 10-11 to see\n\nif the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has\n\nhurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.\n\n\"The dollar is a little soft heading into U.S.-China trade\n\ntalks,\" said Yamada. \"I see some scope for yen gains, but it is\n\nnot likely to be a big move higher.\"\n\nThe United States and China have slapped tariffs on each\n\nother's goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing's\n\ntrading practices, which Washington says are unfair.\n\nCentral banks around the world have been easing policy to\n\ntry to offset the impact of the trade war.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates twice this\n\nyear. Before the jobs report, traders saw a 85.2% chance the Fed\n\nwill cut rates by 25 basis points to 1.75%-2.00% this month, but\n\nthat chance has now fallen to 81.1%, according to CME Group's\n\nFedWatch tool. FEDWATCH\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes\n\nrose to 1.5272% on Monday compared with its U.S. close of\n\n1.5140% on Friday.\n\nSpot gold , an asset often bought during times of\n\nuncertainty, rose 0.05% to $1,505.11 per ounce. GOL/\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS , also considered a safe-haven asset, edged\n\nslightly higher to 106.85 versus the U.S. dollar and gained to\n\n72.12 per Australian dollar AUDJPY= .\n\nU.S. crude was flat at $52.81 a barrel. Brent crude\n\nfell 0.15% to $58.28 per barrel. In addition to worries\n\nabout the global economy, signs of oversupply in the oil market\n\nare weighing on futures prices.\n\nPolitical instability in Hong Kong could hurt market\n\nsentiment after China's army took the unusual step of issuing\n\nwarnings to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong over the\n\nweekend. Hong Kong's stock market is closed on Monday for a public\n\nholiday. Trading will resume on Tuesday.\n\nFour months of often violent protests against Chinese rule\n\nhas pushed the former British colony to the brink of recession\n\nand posed a serious challenge to Beijing's control of the city.\n\nU.S. labour market and recession https://tmsnrt.rs/32XrQ4Q\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Richard Borsuk)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares cheered by U.S. jobs data but traders fear trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE020QH_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
