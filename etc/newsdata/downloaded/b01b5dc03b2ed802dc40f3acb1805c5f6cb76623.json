For some reason, the most recent game to get rated by the Classification Board is ... Grand Theft Auto 3.\n\nRockstar's classic title, which is still my favourite since the series went 3D, is the latest game to get rated by the Classification Board this week. It's not really known how or why GTA 3 is resurfacing out of nowhere, but the Classification Board listing notes that the version is the modified build that Take-Two submitted after the national censors banned GTA 3 on review.\n\nImage: Classification Board\n\nWhat's definitely known, however, is that Rockstar intended for GTA 3 to be re-rated. The R18+ classification didn't exist back in 2002 when the game was banned and re-rated MA15+. I've reached out to Rockstar Australia and the Classification Board for comment, but neither had responded by the time of publication.\n\nEither way, that Rockstar PC launcher is certainly looking like it'll have some content. Now if someone could make sure GTA 1 and 2 are perfectly playable through the launcher without being a pain in the arse on modern systems, that'd make me truly happy.", "description": "Here's a nice surprise to end the week on.
