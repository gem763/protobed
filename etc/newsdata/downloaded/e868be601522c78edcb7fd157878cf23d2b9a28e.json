By age 31 she was running a materials science lab at DuPont, and yet she still didn't know how to pop open the hood of her car.\n\nLike a majority of other women, she dreaded the experience of unfair treatment at the auto-service shop because of her gender, so she enrolled in night classes to become a certified mechanic.\n\nFrom there she began teaching workshops for other women to demystify car maintenance and empower them with the knowledge to confidently discuss repairs with service technicians. (Researchers at Northwestern in 2013 found that repair shops do in fact give higher price quotes to women than men.)\n\nOut of those workshops Banks launched the Girls Auto Clinic business and published a glove box guide for her growing audience that she calls \"she-canics.\"\n\nNow in its third year, the business is straining the capacity of the original three-bay garage in Philadelphia, meaning Banks has her sights on an expansion.\n\nShe recently spoke with Business Insider about what she's learned from her first two years of operation, and what other entrepreneurs should think about when challenging an industry's business model.", "description": "At 33, entrepreneur Patrice Banks earned a diploma in automotive tech and ended her engineering career to launch Girls Auto Clinic in Philadelphia.", "authors": ["Dominick Reuter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0a13b4af90941a5034b46?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
