Seven months ago the organisation said it needed input on whether blasphemy provisions should be broadened to include \"cultural sensitivity\".\n\nInstead it was dropped altogether.\n\nAccording to FPB numbers from 2017, complaints about blasphemy made up 12% of the total complaints it received, just shy of the 14% of complaints that dealt with language. That is double the number of complaints that dealt with violence \u2013 but far outweighed by complaints about sex and nudity, which made up 68% of the total.\n\nFor more go to Business Insider South Africa.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The Film and Publication Board considered making blasphemy a mandatory consideration when age-classifying films \u2013 and expanding it to include cultural issues.
