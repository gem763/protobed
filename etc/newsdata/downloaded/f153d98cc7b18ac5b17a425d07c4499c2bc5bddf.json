The platform that has been updated to enhance its privacy is Deloitte\u2019s Eduscrypt, and its purpose is to enable organizations to track, share, and validate the qualifications of staff.\n\nEduscrypt reportedly allows verification that qualifications are authentic, reduces data errors and creates a shared and permissioned repository of qualification information shared between organizations. Chief Technology Officer of Deloitte\u2019s EMEA Blockchain Lab said:\n\n\u201cAcademics and enterprises both stand to benefit hugely from leveraging blockchain technology \u2014 for most organisations validating, managing and recording the education qualifications of staff and prospective hires can be a very onerous and costly process, with regulatory fines for non-compliance. Integrating QEDIT\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy solution ensures that organisations can trust in the authenticity of qualifications, while preserving the full privacy of the underlying data, and upholding regulatory compliance.\u201d\n\nPrivate transactions on blockchains\n\nThe company explains that it uses ZK-Proofs to allow enterprise blockchain users to record and authenticate transfers without revealing the confidential information involved. Network participants can verify the integrity of the transactions, but they cannot see who sent how much and to whom.\n\nThat being said, the company also provides regulators the tools needed to ensure compliance. QEDIT CEO and co-founder Jonathan Rouach commented by praising the cryptographic innovation that the firm\u2019s system employs:\n\n\u201cThe integration of QEDIT\u2019s privacy solution into Deloitte\u2019s Eduscrypt platform is yet another tangible use-case, demonstrating the far-reaching potential of zero-knowledge proof cryptography to transform processes across a myriad of industries.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported in September, Byzantium, the first half of the Metropolis hard fork development enabled the use of ZK-Proofs on the Ethereum public blockchain.", "description": "Big four auditing firm Deloitte has integrated privacy tech developed by cryptography startup QEDIT into its qualification information blockchain platform Edusc...", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYzUyZmI1ZTEzYzA3MGY3OWM3OWY5NjUyMmRhYWQ4MzEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
