The latest propaganda campaign to discredit President Trump has Soros roots, according to someone in the know that I trust.\n\nVictoria Toensing is not given to empty charges (or empty threats).\n\nThe extremely knowledgeable and well connected D.C. super-lawyer took to Twitter yesterday to let us know that the fine hand of Soros is at work, and the she knows what is going on and will enlighten us in due time:\n\nTo all Tweeters who claim Ukraine not investigating #Burisma and @HunterBiden when @JoeBiden had prosecutor fired, you are mouthing Dem talking points. I talked with relevant Ukrainians. Soros supporter US Amb helped bury case. I know much more. Stay tuned. #maga2020 \u2014 Victoria Toensing (@VicToensing) September 20, 2019\n\nIn addition, @georgesoros and his NGOs spread false information about the Ukrainian prosecutor to help @JoeBiden get him fired. #maga2020 \u2014 Victoria Toensing (@VicToensing) September 20, 2019\n\nThere is a conspiracy theory that has occurred to a number of conservatives: that this is really an operation meant to drive Biden out of the race because his corruption in Ukraine will torpedo him if he becomes the Democrat nominee. The theory is that only by first seeming to implicate Trump would the media leap onto the subject of Ukraine. Once the story is on the table, it will backfire as Biden's corruption becomes undeniable.\n\nPhoto credit: YouTube screen grab (cropped).\n\nHat tip: Roger Luchs.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2019-09/216156.png"}
