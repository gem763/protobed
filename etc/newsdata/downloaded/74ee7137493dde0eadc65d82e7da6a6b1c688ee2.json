Three-quarters say they think the charges should be fully investigated and that Trump has not been honest and truthful about the process.\n\n2020 Vision: Biden's numbers have barely budged\n\nAs for Joe Biden, the NBC/WSJ poll finds that his numbers have barely moved since the Ukraine story became news (and since he and his son have gotten caught up in it \u2014 without any evidence of wrongdoing).\n\nThirty-three percent of Americans say they have a positive view of the former vice president, while 34 percent have a negative view.\n\nIn August's NBC/WSJ poll, Biden's fav/unfav rating was 34 percent positive, 38 percent negative.\n\nOh, and by way of comparison, Trump's fav/unfav rating in the new NBC/WSJ poll is 38 percent positive, 53 percent negative.\n\nYesterday's national Quinnipiac poll also showed little movement in Biden's numbers: In a hypothetical matchup, he leads Trump by 11 points, while Elizabeth Warren leads by 8 points and Bernie Sanders by 7 points.\n\nOn the campaign trail today\n\nJoe Biden, in New Hampshire, holds town halls in Rochester and Manchester\u2026 Elizabeth Warren, in South Carolina, holds a town hall on student with Rep. James Clyburn\u2026 Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are in Iowa\u2026 And Michael Bennet is in the Granite State.\n\nDispatches from NBC's embeds\n\nAfter recovering from a heart attack, Bernie Sanders is going to \"change the nature\" of his campaign, NBC's Gary Grumbach reports: \"When asked by NBC News what he meant by 'change the nature,' Sanders said he plans to slow down his pace of campaigning. 'Probably not doing four rallies a day. I'm not quite sure, I could be wrong on this, I don't know if there is anybody who did more rallies than we have done all over the states and I, you know, probably not do three or four rallies a day, do two or do other things as well.'\"\n\nCory Booker met with the Des Moines Register Editorial Board while in Iowa where, per NBC's Priscilla Thompson, he wasn't asked about \"his history with charter schools or engagement with pharmaceutical companies, something he seems to get asked about often on the trail.\" Booker did express concern about the judicial branch, and said President Trump has \"surrendered his appointment power to right wing extremist groups that then made every judge that had federal aspirations try to go to the margins as far as they could to try out for them.\" When the editorial board asked how he'd work to change the court, Thompson reports, \"Booker said he had ideas that he would not foreshadow now because they'll be part of negotiations.\"\n\nTweet of the day\n\nThe Lid: Poll position\n\nDon't miss the pod from yesterday, when we summed up the NBC/WSJ poll results in 4 minutes.\n\nICYMI: News clips you shouldn't miss\n\nGrave warnings are coming from the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nGet ready for a constitutional clash over impeachment.\n\nThe Supreme Court appears to be divided over an LGBTQ discrimination case. (And Neil Gorsuch could be the swing vote!)\n\nMark your calendar: MSNBC and the Washington Post will co-host the November presidential debate.\n\nBernie Sanders says he was \"dumb\" to ignore symptoms that led to his heart attack.\n\nTrump Agenda: \"Crazy\"\n\nA White House official told the Ukraine whistleblower that Trump's phone call with Zelensky was \"frightening\" and \"crazy,\" per the New York Times.\n\nNancy Pelosi is issuing a warning to Trump as the administration pledges not to cooperate with the House's impeachment investigation.\n\nHouse Democrats are subpoenaing the E.U. ambassador after the State Department blocked his testimony yesterday.\n\nRalph Reedsays evangelicals \"have a moral obligation to enthusiastically back\" Trump in 2020.\n\nFormer president Jimmy Carter has some words of advice for Trump.\n\n2020: Here comes the scrutiny\n\nIs Elizabeth Warren ready for more scrutiny as a frontrunner?\n\nHere's what's going on with the Trump campaign vs. a Minneapolis arena.\n\nNo surprise here \u2014 Dianne Feinstein is backing Joe Biden over Kamala Harris.\n\nHere's what the latest poll says about Saturday's gubernatorial race in Louisiana.\n\nRepublicans are trying to drum up votes for Trump among\u2026 the Amish?\n\nYoung climate activists say Biden hasn't done enough to earn their support.", "description": "First Read is your briefing from \"Meet the Press\" and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4219846/1000x563_nbc-190807-donald-trump-cs-1146a_f82faaecc50816e03616ebfe6d7f80e2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
