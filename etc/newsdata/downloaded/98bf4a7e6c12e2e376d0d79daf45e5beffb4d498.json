With the exception of Pavel Nedved in 2003 and Andriy Shevchenko in 2004 - every winner since 1998 either played for or subsequently signed for the two La Liga superpowers.\n\nVan Dijk could be the first centre-back winner since Fabio Cannavaro, who won while a Real Madrid player in 2006. When Liverpool last won the Champions League in 2005, only three players - Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Luis Garcia - made the shortlist.\n\nProof of a European power shift? Not quite, said Klopp. But he welcomed the recognition.", "description": "There is nothing more symbolic of Liverpool\u2019s restored pedigree than being European champions, but Jurgen Klopp has acknowledged another sign of his club's return to elite status in the form of this year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or nominations.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213766444-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkOwR0iP77jSmoq9t8DUmdoNHfYWyeWsMBqS9RHsrrcU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
