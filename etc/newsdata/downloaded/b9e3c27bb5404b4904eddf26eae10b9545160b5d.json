(AP) - Grammy-winning gospel artist Kirk Franklin says he\u2019s boycotting the Gospel Music Association\u2019s Dove Awards after they edited out part of his acceptance speech earlier this month in which he called for prayers after a police shooting in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nFranklin posted a Facebook video on Monday that said he would no longer attend events associated with the Dove Awards, GMA or Trinity Broadcasting Network \u201cuntil tangible plans are put into place to protect and champion diversity.\u201d The 50th annual awards show was held in Nashville, Tennessee, on Oct. 15 and aired on Oct. 20 on TBN.\n\n\u201cNot only did they edit my speech, they edited the African American experience,\u201d Franklin said.\n\nThe GMA said in a statement that they are \u201cdeeply apologetic\u201d and said it was not their \u201cintent to disregard or silence any of our artists.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time Franklin has criticized the show for editing his statements. In 2016 on the Dove Awards stage, he spoke about police brutality and urged other Christian artists to speak out about racial injustice, but that speech was also edited when it later aired on TBN.\n\nThis year, he referenced a police shooting that had happened just a few days earlier that caused outrage and calls for police accountability.\n\n\u201cA young girl by the name of Atatiana Jefferson was shot and killed in her home by a policeman and I am just asking that we send up prayers for her family and for his, and asking that we send up prayers for that 8-year-old little boy that saw that tragedy,\u201d Franklin said after winning gospel artist of the year.\n\nGMA\u2019s statement said that due to the broadcast window, they had to significantly edit the show down to two hours.\n\n\u201cWe accept the responsibility of our error,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAlthough completely unintentional it caused great harm and deeply wounded many in the African American and gospel community.\u201d\n\nThe statement said they have reached out to Franklin to discuss solutions moving forward.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Grammy-winning gospel artist Kirk Franklin says he's boycotting the Gospel Music Association's Dove Awards after they edited out part of his acceptance speech earlier this month in which he called for prayers after a police shooting in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristin M.
