Boxing champion Mike Tyson launched his own cannabis line. Former NBA player Lamar Odom claims CBD is a \u201cmiracle drug.\u201d\n\nBut Stephen Curry, who formally announced his investment arm SC30 at TechCrunch Disrupt last week, is not aligning himself with CBD whatsoever. The Golden State Warrior star\u2019s investments focus on Series A through C rounds, with a focus on both the consumer and enterprise customer. Bryant Barr, Curry\u2019s roommate and fellow basketball teammate at Davidson College, serves as president. Barr, who has his MBA from Stanford, co-founded Slyce, the now defunct marketing platform, with Curry back in 2015.\n\nThe two have backed Guild Education, which helps corporations provide employees access to tuition reimbursement, online programs and degrees. They have also invested in SnapTravel, a hotel-booking platform via messaging, as well as the latest iteration of Palm, the self-proclaimed \u201cbest small phone for athletes.\u201d\n\nCurry\u2019s investments \u2014 a \u2018brand decision\u2019\n\nWhile Barr and Curry are open to exploring a wide range of industries, they are staying far away from several hot categories \u2014 including CBD and gambling.\n\n\u201cWith CBD, that to me is more of a brand decision,\u201d Barr told Yahoo Finance last week. \u201cThat's Stephen, he\u2019s family first. He's got three kids, and it's not that we want to manufacture a brand. That's just who he is. While he\u2019s playing as an athlete, we would avoid betting too. Betting would be another one that we would stay away from \u2014 from a brand perspective. Those don't help in any shape or form...but I do think gambling is super interesting.\u201d\n\nSC30 is also avoiding making any bets in the medical space.\n\n\u201cWith life sciences, we just don't have the ability to appropriate due diligence, nor do we have the network to really dig in and understand it. Are we going to make a bet here that we can't really wrap our heads around? Anything from a medical perspective, or medtech, is expensive. You're pouring money into it. It's super capital intensive,\u201d Barr said.\n\nThey aren\u2019t jumping on the blockchain bandwagon anytime soon. \u201cI love blockchain in theory, and I think the world will get there at some point. I haven't seen anything where it's like, that seems practical right now. And I think especially when you think about blockchain from a consumer perspective, you have to get the buyer or the consumer to understand what it is that they're buying. And I also haven't seen anybody that has been able to explain it in a really dumbed down layman's version. So it's like, I understand why this is better, like, great, there\u2019s blockchain fantasy football. Okay, well, I can go on Yahoo. And like, put 20 bucks in and it's super easy. Why would I? Why would I do something differently?\u201d posited Barr.\n\nCurry added that he\u2019s only backing ideas he believes in and understands, noting they have passed on the high-growth enterprise space.\n\nIn describing how he and Barr differ as investors, he said, \u201cProbably just where [our] passions are, from a personality standpoint, like what [we\u2019re] truly interested in. You're not going to go 100% in on things that you aren\u2019t passionate about, but there's a reason behind it. And this is probably the only thing where [Bryan\u2019s] like, \u2018I found this really company that\u2019s software, a SaaS [software as a service] company.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo that point, Barr and Curry reflected upon a few missed opportunities in recent startups that have had successful exits \u2014 they had the chance to invest in Zoom (ZM) and Pagerduty (PD) in the private market. But they don\u2019t seem to be losing sleep over it.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, it would have been great. But hindsight is like crap. Yep, we would have made money on these. When we got presented with these opportunities earlier this year, we had probably made four, five investments at the time. And the conversation that we had was, \u2018Hey, there are going to be opportunities all over the spectrum that are going to present themselves as good money-making opportunities.\u2019 But because we're new, we're trying to gain experience. We're educating ourselves along the way, we're going to be much better served coming at this with a significant amount of focus versus spreading ourselves too thin,\u201d Barr said.", "description": "Stephen Curry, who formally announced his investment arm SC30 at TechCrunch Disrupt last week, is not aligning himself with CBD whatsoever.", "authors": ["Melody Hahm", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rLtHukEQK2kQw6ogGigEpw--~B/aD0zMzM4O3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/cf84a080-e9ec-11e9-9bec-1a9dcee4c0a1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
