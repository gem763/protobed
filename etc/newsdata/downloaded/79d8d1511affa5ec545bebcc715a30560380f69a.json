Both have been under investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.\n\nThe pair were charged by a New York grand jury, arrested Wednesday night at Washington Dulles International Airport and were scheduled to appear in Virginia federal court Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe indictments are semi-connected to an impeachment investigation by House Democrats trying to determine whether Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for action against the Bidens. Refusing Congress-approved aid for personal, political benefit is an impeachable offense, many experts say.\n\nThursday\u2019s charges stem from activities Parnas and Fruman conducted at Giuliani\u2019s direction, including removing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch from her post. The indictment says the men acted on behalf of an unnamed Ukranian official and hid the source of their political donations.\n\nProsecutors say the men also pressured Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, to help remove Yovanovitch as they funded his campaign \u2014 and attempted to use political funds to buy licenses to grow marijuana. The indictment said the donations originated with an unidentified Russian businessman.\n\nTrump Jay Sekulow defended the president after the indictment.\n\n\u201cThe alleged activity was done without the knowledge of the candidates or campaign,\u201d he told Politico.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was involved in a July phone call with Trump that eventually grew into the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, said during a marathon news conference Thursday that no sort of blackmail was involved in his dealings with Trump. He added the military aid hadn\u2019t been blocked before the phone call and said the conversation wasn\u2019t related to the funds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to interfere in U.S. elections,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s awaiting an official visit to the United States.\n\n\u201cThe president of the Ukraine just stated again, in the strongest of language, that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday. \u201cHe used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat scam, but it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTrump has acknowledged withholding aid to Ukraine and pressing Ukraine about the Bidens, but has maintained the two issues were not related. Hunter Biden worked for a Ukrainian oil and gas company for five years before he left its board early this year.\n\nThe chairmen of three House committees are leading the investigation and have subpoenaed witnesses and records relevant to the case. Some witnesses did not show up for scheduled depositions, on orders from the Trump administration. The White House said this week it won\u2019t cooperate with any of the Democrats\u2019 requests, classifying the inquiry \u201cillegitimate,\u201d \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and \u201cpartisan.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 Two Russian-born, Florida-based political donors, who prosecutors say offered to pressure Ukraine for an investigation of Democrat", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
