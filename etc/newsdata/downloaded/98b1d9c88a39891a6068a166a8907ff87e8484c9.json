Jordan\u2019s crusading attorney and Jamie Foxx\u2019s wrongly imprisoned Death Row inmate.\n\n\u201cJust Mercy\u201d had been one of the festival\u2019s most anticipated premieres. The film stars Jordan as Bryan Stevenson, founder of Alabama\u2019s Equal Justice Initiative. Foxx plays Walter McMillian, who in 1988 was sentenced to death for the murder of a local young white woman.\n\nMade in the tradition of a Civil Rights drama but set in more contemporary times, \u201cJust Mercy\u201d confronts larger social issues including criminal justice reform, the death penalty and racial profiling. Based on Stevenson\u2019s 2014 book \u201cJust Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption\u201d and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (\u201cShort Term 12\u201d), the film is also a kind of tribute to Stevenson\u2019s activist legal work.\n\nJordan, who has starred in Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and 2015\u2019s \u201cFantastic Four,\u201d said Stevenson is \u201ca real-life superhero.\u201d He called making the film \u201cone of the most enjoyable experiences that I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I had a great deal of pressure to get it right,\u201d said Jordan following the screening. \u201cAnd I felt honored to be able to carry that weight.\u201d\n\nInitial reviews were warm for what critics called a respectful and earnest message movie. But praise was especially heaped on the movie\u2019s performances, including Jordan and Foxx. Both stars are expected to be contenders for next year\u2019s Academy Awards. Warner Bros. is set to release \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d which co-stars Rob Morgan, Brie Larson and O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr., on Dec. 25.\n\nFoxx said he drew on personal experience for his performance. McMillian was ultimately exonerated in 1993 after his case became nationwide news, including a segment on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that illustrated how local police framed McMillian with a false witness.\n\n\u201cI understood a lot of things before we even started,\u201d said Foxx, noting his upbringing in small-town Texas. \u201cI understand what it is, even now today, if I\u2019m driving in my nice car in my nice neighborhood and I see that police officer, it still makes me feel like something could happen.\u201d\n\nStevenson said the evening would only fuel him in his continuing work for criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cAll of these talented people make it a little easier to see what\u2019s at stake when we tolerate injustice, what we lose when we put up with inequality, what we suffer when we permit discrimination and bigotry to rule and shape our lives,\u201d said Stevenson, gesturing to the movie\u2019s cast.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http:/twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The starry based-on-a-true-story social-justice tale \"Just Mercy\" made a powerful impression in its world premiere Friday at the Toronto International Film Festival, drawing an emotional response for the courtroom drama led by Michael B.
