REUTERS/Jose Cabezas\n\nBukele, who took office in June, has vowed to stamp out corruption that has implicated former presidents and said he had created the International Commission Against Impunity in El Salvador (CICIES) through presidential decree.\n\nThe body\u2019s name draws heavily on that of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, or CICIG, whose probes brought down dozens of senior officials and politicians there including Otto Perez, the prior Guatemalan president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clamor among the Salvadoran people to combat corruption,\u201d said Bukele as he signed an agreement with the Organization of American States (OAS) to create the CICIES.\n\n\u201cThe people aren\u2019t just calling for corruption to be fought, it wants corruption to be fought with a CICIES.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations is also considering a request from Bukele to join the OAS in backing the commission.\n\n\u201cOur biggest achievement would be that CICIES isn\u2019t around in 10 years in El Salvador because democratic institutions have strengthened so much,\u201d said Luis Porto, head of the OAS technical mission. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come to stay; we came so that we can go.\u201d\n\nSo disruptive was the CICIG in Guatemala that President Jimmy Morales, whose term ends in January, declared its commissioner persona non grata and refused to renew the commission\u2019s mandate after he too ended up in the crosshairs of its investigators.\n\nThe CICIG left Guatemala earlier this week.\n\nBukele said he would also create a special department in the police and the finance ministry to recover money embezzled from taxpayers and to investigate businesses that evade taxes.\n\nSalvadorans are fed up with graft scandals, and many welcomed news of the CICIES\u2019 creation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right that they investigate. We can\u2019t have more people coming to line their pockets,\u201d said Juan Lopez, 51, a security guard. \u201cBe it good or bad, things have to come to light.\u201d\n\nAntonio Saca, who was Salvadoran president from 2004 to 2009, is in prison for money laundering and embezzlement.\n\nMauricio Funes, president from 2009 to 2014, is accused of money laundering and embezzlement involving $351 million. El Salvador is seeking his extradition from Nicaragua, where Funes has lived since 2016 and claims to have political asylum.", "description": "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Friday unveiled a new independent commission to tackle corruption, taking inspiration from a U.N.-backed body that toppled the previous president of neighboring Guatemala.", "authors": ["Nelson Renteria", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427087929&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8526Y", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
