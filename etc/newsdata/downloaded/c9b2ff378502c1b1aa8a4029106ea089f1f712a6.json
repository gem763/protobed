Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe first six months of the year saw relentless attacks on abortion rights on the state level. Five states passed bills banning the procedure after six weeks, before many women even realize they\u2019re pregnant. And in May, Alabama governor Kay Ivey signed a near-full ban on the procedure. The same month, Missouri \u2014 a state with only one abortion clinic \u2014 passed an extreme eight-week ban that didn\u2019t include any exceptions for instances of rape, incest, or human trafficking. In all, seven states have passed similarly stringent laws in 2019, and more are considering them.\n\nBut in recent months, judges in many of these states have started to issue preliminary injunctions, which allow patients to continue accessing important reproductive care while the court hears the case in full to determine whether or not the bill is constitutional. In short, these court orders \u2014 also known as temporary blocks \u2014 maintain the status quo, allowing abortion to remain legal. Most recently, on October 1, a federal judge temporarily blocked Georgia\u2019s ban.\n\nThe fight doesn\u2019t end here, though. Planned Parenthood director of state advocacy media Bonyen Lee-Gilmore says now is not the time to \u201crest easy,\u201d as states are expected to appeal to circuit courts. Under Trump, these courts have become increasingly hostile to reproductive rights.\n\n\u201cTrump has appointed over 100 judges to the federal bench, and we\u2019re seeing circuit courts become more and more anti-abortion,\u201d Lee-Glimore told the Cut. \u201cThis is no coincidence. Trump is remaking the judicial branch in order to push these unconstitutional laws forward, and we\u2019re seeing these judges stare Supreme Court precedent in the face and create new rules.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s become of all the extreme bans this year so far.\n\nAlabama\n\nStatus: The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood have filed a lawsuit.\n\n\ufeffOn May 15, Alabama governor Kay Ivey signed into law a bill that was so restrictive, even Republicans were divided over it: a near-full ban on the procedure with no exceptions for rape or incest. It would also make performing the procedure a felony in most instances. (The bill does include exceptions in cases where the mother\u2019s life is endangered.)\n\nAs promised, the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama and Planned Parenthood Federation of America swiftly filed a lawsuit to block the Alabama the law, which is scheduled to go into effect in November. While a judge hasn\u2019t ruled on the case yet, attorneys for the state have indicated that they\u2019d be willing put a temporary restraining order on the law until May 2020, while the state and the reproductive-rights organizations suing it resolve the lawsuit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatus: Temporarily blocked.\n\nOn June 28, the ACLU, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit challenging Georgia\u2019s six-week abortion ban, which contains only a few narrow exceptions, including cases in which the woman\u2019s life is endangered or the pregnancy is considered \u201cmedically futile,\u201d and in instances of rape or incest if the woman files a police report. While the law was scheduled to take effect in January 2020, on October 1, District Judge Steve Jones temporarily blocked the ban, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\n\u201cThe federal district court today fulfilled its oath to uphold and defend the Constitution,\u201d ACLU attorney Sean J. Young told the Journal-Constitution. \u201cThis abortion ban has been unconstitutional from start to finish, and today is a victory for the dignity of women throughout Georgia.\u201d\n\nKentucky\n\nStatus: Temporarily blocked.\n\nOn March 15, Kentucky became one of the first states of the year to sign into law its six-week abortion ban, which was scheduled to go into effect immediately, per the New York Times. (The bill includes exceptions when the woman\u2019s life is endangered, but not in cases of rape or incest.) That same day, though, ACLU filed an immediate challenge, and Judge David J. Hale of the Western District of Kentucky temporarily blocked the law on grounds that it was potentially unconstitutional.\n\nLouisiana\n\nStatus: Will only go into effect if Mississippi\u2019s is upheld in a federal appeals court.\n\nOn May 30, Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards signed a law banning nearly all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest. (It\u2019s worth noting that the bill was both sponsored and signed into law by Democrats.) However, the ban will only take effect if a federal appeals court upholds Mississippi\u2019s similar ban.\n\nMississippi\n\nStatus: Temporarily blocked; the attorney general has appealed.\n\n\ufeffOn May 21, Mississippi governor Phil Bryant signed into law a six-week ban; just days later, Judge Carlton W. Reeves issued a preliminary injunction against it, writing in his ruling that the law \u201cthreatens immediate harm to women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The ban] prevents a woman\u2019s free choice, which is central to personal dignity and autonomy,\u201d he continued in his ruling, which he issued on May 24. \u201cThis injury outweighs any interest the state might have in banning abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat.\u201d\n\nOn June 21, though, Mississippi attorney general Jim Hood appealed the federal judge\u2019s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, according to local outlets.\n\nMissouri\n\nStatus: Temporarily blocked.\n\nOn August 27, one day before Missouri\u2019s restrictive ban was scheduled to take effect, U.S. District Court judge Howard Sachs temporarily blocked the ban, NBC News reports. In his order, he wrote that the law seemed \u201cdesigned \u2026 as a protest against Supreme Court decisions.\u201d\n\nHad Missouri\u2019s law gone into effect, it would\u2019ve banned abortion after eight weeks with with no exceptions for instances of rape, incest, or human trafficking. (It would, however, allow for exceptions in cases of medical emergency). Furthermore, doctors who would\u2019ve performed the procedure under the law would\u2019ve faced up to 15 years in prison.\n\nOhio\n\nStatus: Temporarily blocked.\n\nOn July 3, Judge Michael Barrett temporarily blocked the six-week ban that Governor Mike DeWine had signed into law in early April. \u201cThis court concludes that [the bill] places an \u2018undue burden\u2019 on a woman\u2019s right to choose a pre-viability abortion,\u201d Barrett wrote in his injunction order. \u201cThe law is well settled that women possess a fundamental constitutional right of access to abortion.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
