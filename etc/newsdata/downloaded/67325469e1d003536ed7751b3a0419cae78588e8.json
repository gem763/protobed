But their critics warn they could face criminal charges for continuing to insist they are still legislators.\n\nYear-long standoff\n\nThe opposition's attempt earlier this week to anoint Vice President Mercedes Araoz as interim president fell apart after Vizcarra supporters charged her with the usurpation of functions and the military and police reaffirmed their loyalty to Vizcarra.\n\nVizcarra said his decision to dissolve Congress and call for new legislative elections was a constitutional and necessary way to end a year-long standoff with the opposition over his proposed reforms for stamping out entrenched corruption.\n\n191001010733629\n\nHe blamed the majority opposition party Popular Force, led by jailed former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, of trying to use democratic institutions to shield their members and allies from criminal investigations.\n\nThe opposition says Vizcarra has fanned widespread outrage over back-to-back corruption scandals in recent years to orchestrate an unconstitutional power grab.\n\nVizcarra has not yet commented publicly on defiant legislators as he has focused on reshuffling his cabinet.\n\nOn the eve of the swearing-in ceremony, new Prime Minister Vicente Zeballos said the cabinet would continue to preserve the country's decades-old free-market economic model.", "description": "The move comes as a dramatic challenge to the president's leadership by dismissed politicians appeared to fizzle out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/c40eccc8402d4163baf2675a46786b1e_18.jpg"}
