When a business is first beginning, it takes a dedicated and confident leader to come up with the business idea and the vision, make the first sales, and manage the logistics of building a business from scratch.\n\nAs time passes, the leadership of a company also plays a role in garnering a positive financial reputation for your business, inspiring customers to support your business, and attracting and retaining valuable employees.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to prevent the negative impacts of poor leadership, such as mismanagement of finances, poor or no standing in the community, and loss of talent.\n\nAs a business grows, the role of leadership may change, but its impact stays the same.\n\nThe importance of strong leadership for small business\n\nLeadership plays a big role in the success of a small business, and here are just a few of the reasons a growing company needs a strong leader at the helm.\n\nEstablishing a solid financial reputation for your business.\n\nIn order to grow, a business needs to raise capital, which means building relationships with vendors, suppliers and bankers. It\u2019s up to the leader to identify good potential partners for his or her business and to pursue those relationships.\n\nIt is also up to the leader to make sure the business meets its financial obligations responsibly, so that when the opportunity to raise capital comes along, others can see the financial viability of the business.\n\nInspiring others to support your business.\n\nIt is the role of a good leader to ensure the business\u2019s customers are satisfied, treated well, and impressed with the goods or services they receive. Whether this means effectively directing staff or dealing with customers directly, a true leader can do both with respect and authenticity.\n\nAttracting and retaining top talent.\n\nCompanies lacking strong leadership lack one of the most important tools for growth. Employees will struggle to find direction, customers won\u2019t feel loyalty, and the business won\u2019t make the connections or build the reputation it needs to become a healthy and successful company.\n\nGenerally, people want to know that they are doing well and feel like they are making a difference. A big part of this is the vision the leadership of a company creates to unite employees toward a common goal and give purpose to their work.\n\nThis goes a long way toward attracting and retaining top talent, which ultimately saves money and increases productivity for the business.\n\nCompanies lacking strong leadership lack one of the most important tools for growth. Employees will struggle to find direction, customers won\u2019t feel loyalty, and the business won\u2019t make the connections or build the reputation it needs to become a healthy and successful company.\n\nA company without strong leadership behind it will likely be unable to reach its full potential.\n\nTips for leaders for fostering growth and success\n\nTrue leaders never stop trying to improve. Consistency is a trait of strong leaders and is needed to demonstrate a leader\u2019s strength and commitment to the business. When done consistently over time, these simple activities can establish a strong foundation for a small business.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nLead by example. In order to effectively manage a staff and attract customers, leaders need to walk the walk. In other words, leaders must believe and behave the way they expect others to. This gives credibility to their business and makes them more effective as leaders.\n\nHave a mission and vision for your business. Develop strong mission and vision statements for the organization and communicate them as often as possible. An organization with a set of values and a belief system behind it will get much stronger buy-in from customers, employees, and partners alike.\n\nPractice self-care. In order to effectively lead others, you must take care of yourself first. A tired, overwhelmed and stressed out leader won\u2019t inspire others, much less manage a company responsibly. Take care of yourself first, and the rest will fall into place.\n\nStrong leadership is the driving force behind business success. Effective leadership, when practiced consistently, can act as a strong foundation for your business, keeping it on track to meet its financial goals, retain loyal customers and motivate employees.\n\nAmber Colley, senior vice president and business credit expert for Dun & Bradstreet, has coached thousands of business owners on how to establish a business credit profile and leverage their credit to help get funding, improve cash flow, win contracts, and more.", "description": "Companies lacking strong leadership lack one of the most important tools for growth.", "authors": ["Amber Colley"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AColley.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
