He continued: \u201cI remember squeezing Meghan\u2019s hand so tight during the awards, both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day, and more so, what it would be like to do everything we could to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time.\n\n\u201cAnd now, as parents, being here and speaking to all of you pulls at my heart strings in a way I could have never understood until I had a child of my own.\u201d\n\nThe royal went on to explain that no parent wants to see their child suffer from a severe illness.\n\n\"And yet, after meeting all of the WellChild parents and the kids themselves over the years, you\u2019ve managed to give all of us a sense of optimism, a sense of hope and strength that no professional, no bestselling book and no amount of advice can ever give any of us,\" he said.\n\n\"So thank you for being you.\u201d", "description": "The Duke of Sussex\u00a0delivered an emotional speech at an awards ceremony that celebrates children with severe illnesses, explaining that becoming a father has brought new meaning to the event.
