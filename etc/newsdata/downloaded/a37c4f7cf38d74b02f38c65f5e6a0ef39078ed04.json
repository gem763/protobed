'I'm so happy everyone has welcomed me to the neighborhood. I love Canada thank you for welcoming me.'\n\nThe Sooner or Later singer last month showed off massive new ink he'd gotten on his face, depicting singer Rihanna in the style of Greek mythological figure Medusa.\n\nThe artist who applied the tattoo, Herchell Carrasco, told TMZ earlier this month he was caught off-guard when Carter asked for the face tattoo, as he believed he was just going to work on the singer's torso.\n\nHe said that after working out an initial game plan with the singer on the location and size of the ink, he 'just couldn\u2019t' tattoo the singer's entire face.\n\nDebut: The Saturday Night artist last month took to Instagram to show off the new art, writing, 'IM THE BIGGEST THING IN MUSIC RIGHT NOW. I CANT BE DENIED. FACT CHECK ME'\n\nHome sweet home: Carter showed off his new Canadian home on Instagram Stories\n\nCarter 'wanted to keep going and I had to stop him,' Carrasco said, adding, 'I couldn\u2019t cover his whole face in a tattoo.'\n\nCarrasco said he decided Carter was fit to decide on the bold ink.\n\n'Before I tattoo anyone, I take into consideration their mental state,' Carrasco told TMZ. 'In Aaron\u2019s case, I assessed the situation and I genuinely felt he was in a good place mentally to get tattooed.'\n\nSettling in: Carter earlier Monday shared a shot from the front of the abode\n\nBeauty in nature: Carter showed off a set of flowers in the outdoor environment\n\nThe Saturday Night artist said later took to Instagram to show off the new art, writing, 'IM THE BIGGEST THING IN MUSIC RIGHT NOW. I CANT BE DENIED. FACT CHECK ME.'\n\nIt's been a turbulent time for the musical artist, whose siblings Nick, 39, and Angel, 31, last month obtained restraining orders keeping him away from them and their families, citing Aaron's 'increasingly alarming behavior' and access to weapons.\n\nHe said he later turned in his firearm collection to a nearby police station to comply with the restraining orders, and sold off the rest.", "description": "The Sooner or Later singer last week showed off massive new ink he'd gotten on his face, depicting singer Rihanna in the style of Greek mythological figure Medusa.", "authors": ["Adam S.
