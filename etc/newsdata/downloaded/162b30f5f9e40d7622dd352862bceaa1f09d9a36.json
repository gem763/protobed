We are now dealing with it with our lawyers.\"\n\nLizzie's second chapter, titled The Romeo of Richmond, details her fling with Danny and rates him \"nine out of ten on the naughty scale\" for his bedroom athleticism.\n\nShe also hailed the rugby star as \"the greatest kiss of all time\" in the X-rated material, writing: \"I remember thinking I had never ever been kissed like that in my entire life, and in that first initial moment, I realised what I had been missing all those years.\"\n\nThe 49-year-old former WAG, who recently split from nightclub owner Jeremy Gordeno, claimed in the book that she had to sneak into Danny's home for secret sex.\n\n\"He sent me his address, though bizarrely telling me at the same time to 'Gently tap on the door' when I arrived and 'be a bit quiet' when I pulled up outside. I soon found out why. He still lived with his mum,\" she wrote.\n\n(Image: Getty/Premiership Rugby)\n\n\"Now I saw this right away as endearing and if truth be told what did I really expect? He was still just in his early 20s after all. I was double his age. I was in my forties, but it didn't matter at all to me. Nothing did, ever, when it related to him.\"\n\nLizzie, who was previously married to ex-Chelsea footballer Jason Cundy, claimed in her memoir that Danny smuggled her into a hotel while on tour with the England squad and hit her \"behind a plant plot\" so his teammates wouldn't see her leaving the next morning.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt's not the first time Danny has had to defend his sex life in public - Katie Price famously dubbed him Danny Chipolata in her 2013 book Love, Lipstick And Lies.\n\nShe dated the rugby ace in 2011 after her marriage to Pete broke down and they split after she caught him cheating.\n\nShe wrote: \"In my experience he was a bit \u2013 erm \u2013 lean in the most obvious departments.\n\n\"That's why I nicknamed him Danny Chipolata. He can no longer hit the right spots on the rugby field and he certainly can\u2019t find them on a woman.\"\n\n(Image: Phil Lewis/WENN.com)\n\nThe legal action comes after Lizzie's split from Jeremy, who she had been dating for 10 months, amid her claims he'd got close to his ex-fiancee's 21-year-old daughter.\n\nBut Jeremy denied the allegations, saying in a bizarre statement sent to journalists that a mystery person was out to destroy their rollercoaster relationship.\n\nHe also branded false reports that he and Lizzie were set to have a double-wedding with Anthea Turner and Mark Armstrong .\n\n\"I will always be very fond of Lizzie but events outside our control put our relationship under huge strain. I have come to realise it's best we stay just friends,\" he said.\n\n\"The last few months have been like a soap opera. Lizzie and I have been the innocent victim of some wild and false accusations.\"\n\nLizzie hit back, insisting she had been the one to call off their romance.\n\n\"I ended it last week as I was horrified by recent events . I'm shocked and disgusted,\" she added.\n\nMirror Online has contacted reps for Danny and Lizzie for comment.", "description": "Rugby ace Danny Cipriani is demanding \u00a350,000 over alleged details of his sex life with Lizzie Cundy in her new book", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Express Star Pa", "Pa", "Internet Unknown", "Getty Premiership Rugby", "Getty Images", "Phil Lewis Wenn.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14228246.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Danny-Cipriani-blackmailing-court-Case.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
