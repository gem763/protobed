Trump\u2019s got an app for that", "language": "en", "text": "Trump\u2019s reelection campaign plans to launch a new smartphone app this fall to encourage supporters to donate, volunteer and reel in like-minded voters \u2014 all while providing the president more unfiltered access to his followers. Supporters who download the all-in-one app are expected to be able to sign up for a Make America Great Again rally, canvas a neighborhood or call voters, maybe even register to vote as the campaign looks to turn passive supporters into activists.\n\nPerhaps the most important feature will be the app\u2019s use of prizes \u2014 maybe VIP seats or a photo with Trump \u2014 to persuade the most fervent supporters to recruit their friends, rewarding them as campaigns have been doing for top donors for years, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe upcoming launch is the latest sign of how Trump\u2019s team, which ran a ragtag operation in 2016, is using its huge coffers to drive a more professional and data-driven operation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
