It will be powered by Huawei's latest processor called the Kirin 990 which is yet to be unveiled. The Mate 30 will be able to connect to next-generation mobile networks known as 5G which promise super-fast data speeds.\n\nHuawei is pushing ahead with the launch despite being on a U.S. blacklist known as the Entity List. It restricts American firms from doing business with the Chinese company. But the tech giant has been given another 90-day reprieve under which U.S. firms can apply for special licenses to sell to Huawei.\n\nGoogle is subject to these restrictions. Huawei relies on Google's Android operating system to power its smartphones. In China, Huawei uses a modified version of Android which is stripped of Google services like Gmail or Maps because those are blocked in the country. Instead, it pre-loads its own apps. But in international markets, those Google services are pre-loaded on Huawei phones.\n\nNot having access to Google services abroad could damage Huawei's global ambitions to become the number one smartphone maker in the world, analysts say.", "description": "Huawei will launch a new flagship phone next month which may not come with Google apps, a source told CNBC.", "authors": ["Arjun Kharpal"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105939264-1559186864684gettyimages-1146667825.jpeg?v=1565329550"}
