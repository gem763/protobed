Kansas will try to stay in the game long enough to give itself to keep those same fans interested, though its wipeout loss at TCU last week doesn\u2019t create much confidence in new coach Les Miles\u2019 bunch.\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nOklahoma QB Jalen Hurts against the Kansas secondary, which played well at Boston College but has been inconsistent this season. Hurts is also a dynamic runner, and those same defensive backs will be called upon a lot to bring him down in the open field. If the Alabama transfer wants to become yet another Oklahoma quarterback to bring home the Heisman Trophy, this ought to be a good opportunity to put up gaudy numbers.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nOklahoma: RB Trey Sermon is averaging an absurd 8.1 yards per carry, though he\u2019s often forgotten because of Hurts and his fleet of fast, talented wide receivers. Sermon only has 34 carries all season, but he\u2019s gone for 274 yards and three TDs.\n\nKansas: RB Pooka Williams needs to step up in a big way after a huge performance against Oklahoma last season. Fellow RB Khalil Herbert left the program last week, and that means more opportunities for the Jayhawks\u2019 biggest playmaker.\n\nFACTS & FIGURES\n\nOklahoma is seeking its 22nd consecutive true road win, the longest streak in the nation. Clemson is next with nine in a row. \u2026 The Sooners have won 14 straight against Kansas, their longest streak against any opponent. Oklahoma has won the past five games by a combined 258-60. \u2026 Hurts leads the nation with a 249.9 quarterback rating. He threw for 415 yards against Texas Tech last week in just three quarters. \u2026 Oklahoma is averaging a nation-leading 668.5 yards, more than 100 more than second-place UCF. \u2026 Sooners WR CeeDee Lamb is sixth nationally in yards per catch (25.9) and TD receptions (six). \u2026 Kansas has not defeated a ranked team since beating No. 15 Georgia Tech on Sept. 11, 2010. \u2026 Jayhawks WR Andrew Parchment has three 100-yard receiving games this season. \u2026 Freshman LB Gavin Potter had 11 tackles in his first career start for Kansas last week. \u2026 Jayhawks P Kyle Thompson is among the top 20 nationally with 46 yards per punt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No. 6 Oklahoma (4-0, 1-0 Big 12) at Kansas (2-3, 0-2), Saturday at noon EDT (ABC).", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
