Lol.\"\n\nEssex PPC candidate Bill Capes posted this tweet on March 22, 2019. (Bill Capes/Twitter)\n\nCapes initially denied the tweets, saying it was possible someone might have hacked his account.\n\n\"I work with so many different people here,\" said Capes. \"There's no way I would make ... no way I would stand beside a statement like that.\"\n\nCapes later confirmed the existence of the tweets in a separate interview with CBC News.\n\n\"I looked back through my old files and I did the see the tweet,\" Capes said. \"I understand the context that was there.\"\n\nCapes did not provide details regarding the context of the tweets.\n\nThis tweet, posted in March of 2019, is part of a conversation about gender identity. (Bill Capes/Twitter)\n\nOther tweets made reference to \"Mother Nature\" ruling on gender identity, a Somalian janitor with \"no language\" and being a \"proud white dude hiding in plain sight in a hijab.\"\n\nExecutive director of WETrans Support Jayce Carver said she doesn't understand why cisgender people care so much about how transgender people identify themselves.\n\n\"I'm exhausted by [this],\" said Carver. \"Transgender continually have to defend who we are, as people. Being trans doesn't affect cisgender people, other than having to learn a couple new pronouns.\"\n\nCarver said she wishes cisgender people would come at the topic with more empathy.\n\nThis tweet, also posted March of 2019, is part of a conversation about white people wearing hijabs. (Bill Capes/Twitter)\n\n\"Any conversation, good or bad, I think we can learn a lot from the dialogue,\" said Carver. \"Sometimes it takes comments like this [tweet] to start the conversation.\"\n\nCapes said he doesn't agree with racism in \"any way, shape or form.\"\n\n\"I will defend anyone of a different race than myself that's reflected by a cheap stereotype,\" he said. \"That's not right. That's the cheapest form of racism. I disagree with it 100 per cent.\"\n\nThis tweet, also posted March of 2019, is part of a conversation about U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nCapes is not the first local candidate to admit to making discriminatory comments.\n\nWindsor West Green Party candidate Quinn Hunt previously apologized for having \"said and done racist, sexist and homophobic things.\"\n\nCBC News has reached out to People's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier, but has yet to receive comment.", "description": "The People's Party of Canada candidate for the Essex riding responded to discriminatory posts published on Twitter earlier this spring.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5179113.1560808769!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bill-capes.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
