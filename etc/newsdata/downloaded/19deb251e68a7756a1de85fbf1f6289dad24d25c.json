(Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron has broken his long silence on Brexit, confessing in new memoirs that he is \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for the chaos and rancor that has engulfed Britain after it voted to leave the European Union three years ago.\n\n\u201cI failed,\u201d Cameron concedes in his book, \u201cFor the Record,\u201d excerpted on Saturday in the London Times.\n\nThe memoirs are artfully revealing. Cameron both covers his posterior and concedes some mistakes \u2014 of strategy and timing, mostly. He admits he is today \u201cdepressed\u201d about Brexit; he charges that the current prime minister, Boris Johnson, was a major misleader; and he confesses he smoked a lot of dope during his Eton school days \u2014 sneaking off to an island in the River Thames to get \u201coff my head\u201d on marijuana.\n\nIt was Cameron who confidently called for the June 2016 Brexit referendum \u2014 and it was Cameron who led the muddled, muted campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union.\n\nAfter Brexit won 52 percent to 48 percent, Cameron quickly resigned, notably caught on a hot mic humming a tune as he strode away from the podium in front of 10 Downing Street.\n\nMany Britons blame Cameron for today\u2019s Brexit quagmire, branding the former prime minister as \u201cthe man who broke Britain.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s critics say the British public was never really clamoring for the 2016 referendum and that Cameron called it only to quell internal squabbles in his fractious Conservative Party and to quiet the rabid Tory tabloids.\n\nCameron confesses the whole thing quickly devolved into a \u201cterrible Tory psychodrama.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Times newspaper, as a part of the book\u2019s pre-publication publicity campaign, Cameron labeled Prime Minister Johnson\u2019s possible \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit \u201ca bad outcome.\u201d\n\nHe also warned that the country might be forced to stage a second referendum on whether to leave the European Union.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can rule it out, because we\u2019re stuck,\u201d said Cameron, who served as prime minister from 2010 to 2016.\n\nIn his memoir and interview, Cameron charges that his former political chums \u2014 Johnson and his sidekick, the current government minister in charge of carrying out Brexit, Michael Gove \u2014 misled voters in 2016 about the swell benefits of leaving Europe.\n\nCameron calls his former friend Gove \u201cmendacious\u201d and says Gove and Johnson behaved \u201cappallingly\u201d during the 2016 referendum.\n\nCameron points to their false pro-Brexit claims that Turkey was about to join the European Union (it wasn\u2019t) and their suggestions that soon Britain would be flooded by millions of Turkish Muslim immigrants (never happened).\n\nAlthough he does not call Johnson or Gove liars, Cameron said the pair \u201cleft the truth at home\u201d when they claimed, for example, that leaving Europe would produce a $440 million a week windfall to fund the country\u2019s beloved National Health Service.\n\n\u201cBoris had never argued for leaving the EU, right? Michael was a very strong Eurosceptic, but someone whom I\u2019d known as this liberal, compassionate, rational Conservative ended up making arguments about Turkey and being swamped and what have you. They were trashing the government of which they were a part, effectively,\u201d Cameron told the newspaper.\n\nIn a bit of a side-dish, Cameron remembers Johnson\u2019s current special adviser, Dominic Cummings, who ran the leave campaign in 2016 and came up with the slogan \u201ctake back control,\u201d for spreading \u201cpoison\u201d and turning Tory against Tory.\n\nCameron said his Brexit defeat three years ago has left him \u201chugely depressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next,\u201d Cameron said.\n\nAnd yet. The former leader still argues that Britain was never really comfortable in the European Union and that a referendum was \u201cinevitable\u201d and the \u201cright approach.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Cameron wants it both ways. He failed. But it was the right thing to do.\n\nIn his interview, Cameron criticizes Johnson\u2019s move recently to suspend Parliament and accuses him of \u201csharp practices\u201d in stripping 21 Conservative lawmakers of their party membership for rebelling against him.\n\nIn other excerpts, Cameron recalls with some shame his membership in the elite University of Oxford drinking society, the Bullingdon Club. At his initiation into the posh ranks, he remembers how he awoke hung over, with wine bottles piled outside his door, to find a group of his new Bullingdon buddies \u2014 which probably included Boris Johnson, Cameron admits he cannot quite recall \u2014 \u201cwith one of them standing on the legs of an upended table, using a golf club to smash bottles as they were thrown at him.\u201d\n\nIt is a stunning image of the two men who would come to define the Brexit age.\n\nRead more\n\nEuropeans once hoped the British would reverse Brexit.
