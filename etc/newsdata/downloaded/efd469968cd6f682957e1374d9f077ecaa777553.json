That\u2019s how we blew it.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have games like against Tottenham where everything runs smoothly \u2014 then you have days like today or against Hoffenheim.\n\n\u201cWe simply have to do better with our chances.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Clean out \u2013\n\nGnabry scored in Augsburg as did Robert Lewandowski who equalled the Bundesliga record with goals in each of the first eight games this season.\n\nWith 16 goals in 12 games in all competitions so far, Lewandowski is in the form of his career, but the 31-year-old is running out of time to win the Champions League trophy with Bayern.\n\nHis pre-season demands for reinforcements were answered with Ivan Perisic, 30, signed from Juventus and Philippe Countinho, 27, opted for Munich to reboot his career after an unhappy spell at Barcelona.\n\nCountinho\u2019s silky passing provides Lewandowski with plenty of chances and the pair have forged a key partnership at the heart of Bayern\u2019s attack in the wake of Kovac\u2019s squad clean out.\n\nSenior veterans Franck Ribery, 36, Arjen Robben, 35, and Rafinha, 34, who helped win the 2013 Champions League title, have all been moved on.\n\nDespite having only recently turned 30, club stalwart Thomas Mueller has also been deemed surplus to requirements, starting on the bench in Bayern\u2019s last seven games as Countinho\u2019s back-up.\n\n\u2013 Boateng\u2019s chance \u2013\n\nMats Hummels has been sold back to former club Borussia Dortmund, but now his former centre-back partner Boateng can prove himself after Suele\u2019s injury.\n\nHaving been heavily linked to Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus this year, Boateng could now partner Lucas Hernandez at Olympiakos, where Bayern chase a third straight win to stay top of Group B.\n\nKovac had been using Suele, 24, and Hernandez, 23, as centre-backs, backed up by France\u2019s 2018 World Cup winner Benjamin Pavard, 23, who can play in the middle of defence or left-back.\n\nSuele had been part of a key quartet of rising Germany stars at Bayern, along with Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka \u2014 all still only 24.\n\nBayern have reached at least the semi-finals of the Champions League in seven of the previous ten seasons, but crashed out in the last 16 to eventual winners Liverpool in 2018/19.\n\nHowever, the effect of bringing in new blood like Countinho was obvious at Tottenham, where the ruthless performance suggested \u201cBayern are one of the favourites this season,\u201d said Sky pundit Didi Hamann.\n\nYet as the Hoffenheim and Augsburg performances showed, Kovac\u2019s new-look Bayern is still raw as the club looks to avoid another knock-out phase exit, like in recent years, against such teams as Liverpool, Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n\n\u201cA lot needs to go wrong for the other teams and everything must be perfect for Bayern to shorten the gap on the international stage,\u201d ex-Germany midfielder Stefan Effenberg told magazine Kicker.\n\n\u201cI see Barcelona, Liverpool, Manchester City and Juventus being ahead of Bayern.\u201d", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Bayern Munich face Olympiakos away in the Champions League on Tuesday with key defender Niklas Suele sidelined as Niko Kovac\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/434217_serge-gnabry-celebrates-scoring-goals-bayern-munich-in-thrashing-tottenham-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
