While Awad did find some success with his right hand throughout the early exchanges, it was Daley who landed the telling blow.\n\nBritish MMA's legendary left-hook grenadier, Paul Daley (42-17-2), detonates once more, with feeling, on Saad Awad to score a calamitous, second-round stoppage! The 16-year vet boasts a staggering 33 finishes, each by knockout. #Bellator232pic.twitter.com/X17YrATTu4 \u2014 Kyle Johnson (@VonPreux) October 27, 2019\n\nPaul Daley TKO\u2019s Saad Awad in the second round. The power of Daley is just scary. One massive left hand and Awad was flat on his back. Props to Awad for stepping in on six days notice though. #Bellator232pic.twitter.com/QiAL5eE2Zh \u2014 Joel Griffith (@joelgriffith88) October 27, 2019\n\nElsewhere on the card, Douglas Lima defeated Rory MacDonald by a clear-cut decision through five rounds of action to win the Bellator welterweight title and its welterweight grand prix - along with a cool $1 million prize.\n\nThe victory will be a sweet one for Brazil's Lima, who lost the championship to MacDonald in their first meeting in January of last year, setting up a potential 'winner takes all' trilogy bout between the two next year.\n\nKevin Ferguson Jr., or 'Baby Slice' as he is known, took less than a minute to KO Craig Campbell to increase his record to 4-2 while Nick Newell, a congenital amputee fighter, lost for just the third time in his 19-fight career after coming up short on a split decision against Manny Muro.", "description": "Paul Daley showed once again why he is considered among the biggest power punchers in mixed martial arts as he earned a spectacular knockout finish of fellow veteran fighter Saad Awad during Saturday's Bellator 232 event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db5804b203027534d4e7e28.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
