Thankfully, in the case of the new Galaxy S10E, that\u2019s no longer true. With the 10th anniversary Galaxy, Samsung is offering a smaller variant of its flagship phone that punches way above its weight.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the S10E than just its size. But, for a lot of people, that may be the strongest reason to choose this model over the S10 or S10 Plus. If you\u2019re intent on upgrading to one of the new S10 models, the S10E is the best Galaxy model for most.\n\nOur review of Samsung Galaxy S10E Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Better fingerprint sensor than bigger S10s\n\nGreat size\n\nMost bang for your buck Bad Stuff Niche features like Bright Night and wide angle selfie not as good as Pixel\u2019s\n\nScreen layout can be awkward and disproportionate\n\nBattery life could be better Buy for $739.99 from Amazon Buy for $749.99 from Best Buy Buy for $749.99 from Walmart\n\nThe best way to think about this phone is to figure out what the \u201cE\u201d in S10E stands for. Samsung\u2019s already said that the E is short for \u201cessential,\u201d but where the device stands out is its ergonomics. The S10E measures just one millimeter narrower than the canonical S10, but it\u2019s significantly shorter by 7.7 mm, or roughly a third of an inch, and it\u2019s more comfortable to hold securely \u2014 especially if you have smaller hands like I do.\n\nI prefer the S10E\u2019s flat screen over the S10\u2019s curved edges\n\nDespite a tiny width difference, the S10E\u2019s display drops to a 5.8-inch screen from the S10\u2019s 6.1-inch screen due to thicker bezels on the side. Personally, I think Samsung could have gone even smaller. It still doesn\u2019t quite fit in my jeans pockets without peeping out from the top. The company says it stuck with a 5.8-inch display because it found that Galaxy customers liked that size from the S8 and S9.\n\nThe S10E\u2019s screen is also flat instead of using the curved sides that Samsung put on its flagship Galaxies from the past few years. I actually prefer this screen over the other S10s. Full-screen videos look less warped, and my palm doesn\u2019t wrap over the edge screen as much. It also makes the edge lighting feature for notifications look much more vibrant and lively against the darker sides of the screen.\n\nOne main differentiator between the S10E and its taller siblings is the placement of the fingerprint sensor. Instead of the new (and somewhat controversial) in-screen reader, the S10E built a capacitive sensor into power button on the right side. Its placement is right around where your right thumb normally rests when you pick up the phone, making it a lot more natural to use than the in-screen sensor. It\u2019s also extremely fast and authenticates instantaneously. There\u2019s a small divot that lets you easily find the power button without looking at where you\u2019re aiming, which I find nicer than Sony\u2019s side fingerprint design that has it flush with the rest of the phone.\n\nLeft-handers might find the fingerprint reader\u2019s placement to be awkward\n\nEven with this placement, left-handers might find it a bit awkward to use. Remember how the S8\u2019s fingerprint sensor was on the right side of the rear camera? Then, with the S9, Samsung moved it to the center underneath the camera lens? When you have the S10E in your left hand, you end up having to use your left index or middle finger sideways to reach the power button. In my experience, it took longer for the S10E to register my left fingerprints, and sometimes it could take a bit of finesse to get that sideways placement just right. Once you have this nailed down, it does work fast and fine, but it still feels like a left-hand-friendly design was an afterthought.\n\nOne great thing about the S10E\u2019s power button is that you can still use it to drag down the top navigation bar, which is a feature you end up losing with the S10\u2019s in-screen reader. Even with the shorter display, I still can\u2019t quite reach the top of the screen without wiggling the phone down my palm, so being able to navigate in this way is super convenient \u2014 as long as the phone is in your right hand.\n\nLet\u2019s loop back to Samsung\u2019s interpretation of the E in S10E: essentials. I think Samsung has mostly nailed that. With this phone, you\u2019re not sacrificing much of the S10 experience, and the list of things that are constant between the S10E and the S10 is a lot longer than what it\u2019s missing.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10E versus S10 Category Samsung Galaxy S10E Samsung Galaxy S10 Category Samsung Galaxy S10E Samsung Galaxy S10 OS Android 9 Pie (One UI) Android 9 Pie (One UI) Display 5.8-inch Full HD+ (2,280 x 1,080) AMOLED 6.1 inches Quad HD+ (3040 x 1440) AMOLED Dimensions (mm) 142.2 x 69.9 x 7.9mm 149.9 x 70.4 x 7.8mm Weight 150g 157g Battery capacity 3,100mAh 3,400mAh Processor Snapdragon 855 Snapdragon 855 RAM 6, 8GB depending on configuration 8GB Storage 128, 256GB 128, 512GB MicroSD support Yes, up to 512 GB Yes, up to 512 GB Ports USB-C charging port, 3.5mm headphone jack USB-C charging port, 3.5mm headphone jack Rear cameras 12MP (variable F/1.5-2.4, OIS, auto focus) wide angle, 16MP (F/2.2, fixed focus) ultra wide 12MP (variable F/1.5-2.4, OIS, auto focus) wide angle, 16MP (F/2.2, fixed focus) ultra wide, 12MP (F/2.4) telephoto Front cameras 10MP (F/1.9, auto focus, 80 degree) 10MP (F/1.9, auto focus, 80 degree) Biometrics Side-mounted fingerprint sensor, face unlock In-screen reader, face unlock Water resistance IP68 IP68 Wireless charging Yes, with 4.5W reverse wireless charging Yes, with 4.5W reverse wireless charging Stereo speakers Dolby Atmos Dolby Atmos\n\nHere\u2019s what you actually give up: the telephoto lens, a bigger battery, and a nicer screen. The S10E has a Full HD display instead of a Quad HD display, which means it\u2019s only 1080p wide and has about 100 ppi less than the regular S10. If you\u2019re coming from a Quad HD display, this difference could be noticeable. For me, I only started to see the discrepancies when I lined it up with another phone in its category, like the Pixel 3. Even after adjusting the tones on the S10E for more vibrancy, the whites are whiter on the Pixel, and you get a lot more depth there. But it\u2019s something I don\u2019t think most people will notice without directly comparing the screens.\n\nThe same could be said about the S10E\u2019s camera. Sure, it only has two cameras in the rear instead of three, but I think 95 percent of people will love the photos that this phone can take. Pictures are sharp and vibrant, and there\u2019s a lot of versatility between its Pro, Instagram, and Beauty modes. (Skin smoothing on the Samsung looks a lot more natural when you don\u2019t crank the volume all the way up to 7, but I know it\u2019s fake, and that makes it a lot less fun to use, much less share. But more power to you if you enjoy it!)\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere it starts to feel like you\u2019re missing out is when you compare niche features to competitors like the Pixel. I\u2019ll admit that perhaps I\u2019m spoiled by the Pixel\u2019s Night Sight and ultra-wide selfies. With low light photography, in particular, you can\u2019t manually turn Bright Night on for the S10E unless it\u2019s very dark out. Even with it on, the processing just looks much better on Pixel\u2019s Night Sight, with more details and vibrancy.\n\nAs for the wide angle selfie camera, the S10E\u2019s lens doesn\u2019t extend as far for group selfies (97 degrees field of view on the Pixel versus 80 degrees on the S10E). It also tends to overexpose skin tones and make everyone look pale.\n\nThese are minor grievances, though. If you\u2019re coming from an older Galaxy, you\u2019ll be very happy with the upgrades without splurging for the $1,000 S10.\n\nThe battery is a little smaller at 3,100mAh compared to the S10\u2019s 3,400mAh battery, but it works out to be roughly the same battery life because of the S10E\u2019s smaller display. I\u2019ve been using the device for a few days, and it makes it through an entire day of scrolling through Twitter, Instagram, Slack, and playing games on my commute without needing to recharge until I go to bed. (That\u2019s without using the power-saving mode.) Batteries do degrade over time, though, so I worry that, in a few months, this won\u2019t be the case. For now, I\u2019d recommend keeping power saving on to keep the device trudging longer into the night.\n\nGet a better screen protector\n\nThere are a couple of other things I didn\u2019t love, including the size of Samsung\u2019s default keyboard. With a smaller display, everything is naturally going to be more condensed, and I found myself making more typos even after making the keyboard as large as it can get. I also ran into similar issues that we had with the S10 / S10 Plus\u2019 face unlock, and I was also able to unlock the device with a video of myself.\n\nThankfully, these are easy things to work around. If you decide to go for this device, the first things to do are to adjust the icons so that they don\u2019t look cartoonishly big and download an app like Gboard to address the keyboard issues. For biometric unlocks, just stick with the fingerprint sensor and a pin / pattern.\n\nOne last thing to note with the S10s is that they now come with a screen protector preinstalled. And while it\u2019s thoughtful of Samsung to include it out of the box, it\u2019s not very good at protecting against scratches. I\u2019ve only had the device for a week, and I\u2019ve already seen some significant scrapes. The corner radius and the hole-punch camera also don\u2019t quite match up with the display, which is hard to unsee once you spot it. I\u2019d go ahead and just get a better screen protector and not rely on the one Samsung stuck on here.\n\nThe last E is economics. At $750, you\u2019re getting nearly the full S10 experience without spending as much money and in a size that\u2019s a lot more appealing across demographics. Samsung phones also tend to go on sale pretty quickly after new Galaxies are announced, so you\u2019ll probably find the S10E discounted or in BOGO deals very soon.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good, small Android or one that isn\u2019t uncomfortably close to a thousand bucks, this is a phone that I think most people will enjoy without sacrificing much in quality. Smaller and cheaper doesn\u2019t have to mean worse, and I think it\u2019s time major smartphone manufacturers start making devices that can do the most without a gigantic size. The S10E is a good step in the right direction, one I hope others will follow.", "description": "Samsung\u2019s smallest Galaxy, the S10E, proves that bigger isn\u2019t always better and that it may be time for other phone manufacturers to start making tinier flagship devices.", "authors": ["Natt Garun", "Mar"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BbpHhNxCENc9Z2FTXBpu3bA-yEU=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15957298/akrales_190311_3263_0197.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
