We will continue to assess the effects of recent changes to the law and its implementation.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to work with the police to ensure pre-charge bail conditions are being imposed where appropriate, including to protect victims and witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe government is listening to the concerns that have been raised about pre-charge bail to understand the underlying issues and consider what further mitigations can be put in place.\u201d", "description": "The government must change the law to ensure domestic and sexual abuse victims are not at risk when their attackers are on bail, an MP and campaigners have said.", "authors": ["Lizzie Dearden"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/07/19/police-officers.jpg"}
