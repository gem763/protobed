But unlike Sanders, Warren refused to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All \u2014 a stance that\u2019s increasingly difficult to maintain given her more prominent status.\n\nHer rivals seized on the opportunity to pounce.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work but, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done,\u201d said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nRead: 12 Democrats square off over impeachment, health care in Ohio presidential debate: live blog recap\n\nPete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, added: \u201cWe heard it tonight. A \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 question that didn\u2019t get a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer.\u201d\n\nWarren insisted that she has \u201cmade clear what my principles are here,\u201d arguing that lower premiums would mean that overall costs would go down for most Americans.\n\nFeaturing a dozen candidates, the debate sponsored by CNN and The New York Times was the largest in modern history. It was the first time the White House hopefuls gathered in a little more than a month. In that time, the political landscape has changed with Trump facing an impeachment inquiry in the House centered on his quest to get Ukraine to dig up unflattering details about Joe Biden, another front-runner among the Democrats hoping to succeed him.\n\nThe debate also served as Sanders\u2019 return to the campaign trail following a heart attack earlier this month. The Vermont senator failed to show the same fire as in previous debates. He got applause when he thanked supporters and rivals for their good wishes and declared, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d\n\nThe debate touched on foreign policy, too, a subject that has dominated the news in recent weeks as Trump said he was withdrawing most U.S. forces from Syria and then Turkey invaded the northern part of the country to attack Kurdish fighters. The Democratic presidential candidates denounced the president for abandoning Kurdish forces there, who are U.S. allies.\n\nHawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who served in Iraq with the Army, questioned the need for U.S. involvement in \u201cregime change\u201d conflicts in the Middle East. That prompted Buttigieg to respond: \u201cWhat we are doing or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there,\u201d said Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan. \u201cIt is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.\u201d\n\nBiden had spent months facing sharp criticism from the rest of the field during debates, but he saw few candidates engage with him on Tuesday. Still, he struggled to fully explain why his newly promised ethics plan to prevent conflicts of interest involving his relatives wasn\u2019t applied to his son Hunter when he was hired in 2014 as a director for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThat relationship has become a focal point of Trump\u2019s effort to press for a Ukrainian government probe of the Bidens \u2014 an effort that was a major factor leading to the House impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden had vowed that \u201cno one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they\u2019re a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country.\u201d\n\nBut CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked, \u201cIf it\u2019s not OK for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president?\u201d\n\nBiden faltered some before offering, \u201cMy son did nothing wrong, I did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nStill, most of the back-and-forth focused on Warren. Taking aim at her proposal to tax the wealthiest Americans, Klobuchar said, \u201cI want to give a reality check here\u201d and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke suggested it was \u201cpunitive.\u201d\n\nThe senator said that notion shocked her: \u201cI don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso debating were California Sen. Kamala Harris, New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Obama housing chief Juli\u00e1n Castro. Making his debate debut was billionaire activist Tom Steyer.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren repeatedly came under attack during Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate as rivals accused the Massachusetts senator of ducking...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT380_debate_ZG_20191015210251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
