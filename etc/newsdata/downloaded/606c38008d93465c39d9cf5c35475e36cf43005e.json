He\u2019s so despicable. He makes my head stand up\u2014my hair. I can\u2019t stand him!\u201d\n\nMcCain, meanwhile, said that \u201cthe humanity seems completely removed\u201d from Trump, adding that the \u201cbest part of America\u201d is that we\u2019re supposed to be the \u201cshining beacon on the hill\u201d and yet the president is now refusing to help people devastated by a natural disaster.\n\nThis prompted co-host Whoopi Goldberg to openly wonder how anyone can look at this and say that this isn\u2019t a racial problem, considering the vast majority of the Bahamian survivors are black.\n\n\u201cWhite people are constantly saying you always talk about race,\u201d Goldberg added. \u201cWell, this is a race card. The card can\u2019t get any bigger than this!\u201d\n\nLater on, McCan went back to the comparison between Trump\u2019s willingness to host the Taliban at the presidential retreat days before the 9/11 anniversary and his dismissive attitude towards evacuees.\n\n\u201cThe juxtaposition of hypothetically inviting al Qaeda to Camp David at the same time, whatever, terrorists, any terrorist,\u201d the conservative host shouted. \u201cI thought it was a joke and then I started screaming to my husband.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe idea of doing it so close to 9/11 and saying that these people are gang members, it should be infuriating. You\u2019re okay with terrorists. You\u2019re not okay with refugees from a hurricane!\u201d", "description": "\u201cI thought it was a joke and then I started screaming,\u201d McCain said of the revelation that Trump invited terrorists to Camp David but refused entry for Bahamian refugees.", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568135072/view_57_trud0s", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
