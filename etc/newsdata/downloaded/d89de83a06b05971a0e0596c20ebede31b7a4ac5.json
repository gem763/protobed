Surely not this season. A top six club? On this evidence they'll be mired in mid-table for the entire campaign.\n\nThe demise of the richest club in the land continued a pace at St James's Park.\n\nIn the 72 minutes, another meek, bog-standard performance was put out of its misery by a 19-year-old Geordie playing his first Premier League game.\n\nMatty Longstaff rifled home from 20 yards and it was five games without a win for the once mighty reds.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nCue ashamed looks among nine outfield players. Some stared at their boots, others blankly into the distance.\n\nThere was a harsh exchange of words between Marcus Rojo and Andreas Pereira and skipper Ashley Young clapped furiously ordering a response.\n\nNone came.\n\nIt's just two wins in the league in eight games, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is yet to taste victory in an away game since getting the job on a permanent basis.\n\nHow long can he survive with this sort of performance, and with his recent record and the club's worst start in 30 years.\n\nOld Trafford legend Steve Bruce, masterminding his first win as a manager against the side he won 12 trophies with as a player, won't have recognised his former club.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere can't have been a weaker, and more timid, Manchester United side fielded at St James' Park in the past three decades.\n\nThe swagger has gone. The old fear-factor evaporated for the moment Young mis-controlled a pass wide on the left and let it go for a throw in.\n\nLongstaff Jnr, surprisingly called up for his top flight debut to add punch and energy to previously lacklustre midfield, enjoyed his moment alongside brother Sean, who was linked in the summer with a \u00a340m switch to Old Trafford, the Geordie Crown Jewels.\n\nTo think it was meant to be the visiting United building with young English talent, not Bruce's formerly beleaguered side.\n\nWhere does Solskjaer start reviving this lot? True there were some big names missing, but Paul Pogba and co have hardly set the team on fire for a while.\n\nMarcus Rashford was hopelessly isolated up front as the central striker, unable to provide a focal point.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThat meant the visitors couldn't build pressure in the final third, even against a Newcastle side who have leaked goals alarming rate this season.\n\nThey had three shots on target all game and it took them 44 minutes to fashion a serious chance. Having gone the entire Europa League game with Alkmaar with out a shot in midweek, they failed to seriously test Martin Dubravka.\n\nYoung's corner presented Harry Maguire with a free header eight yards out but he slithered a header wide when he should have scored.\n\nOnly in the last half hour did they asset some sort of territorial dominance, lacking the class to unlock an comfortable home defence.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere was nothing reminiscent of the old title showdowns that this fixture threw up early this century.\n\nWhere Solskjaer's side lack identity, Bruce has now found one. Or rather rekindled the organisation of Rafa Benitez's reign, adding in the zip of Alain Saint-Maximin.\n\nThe United boss played the high risk strategy of hammering his players last weekend, and on Friday expressed doubts about their sprinting prowess, and got a brilliant response.\n\nHe railed against his critics on Friday saying they make him out to be a mug, despite having 400 top flight games under his belt.\n\nThe only ones looking mugs after this clash were Manchester United.", "description": "Manchester United suffered yet another devastating setback as Matty Longstaff rifled home the winning goal for Newcastle", "authors": ["Simon Bird", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20526478.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
