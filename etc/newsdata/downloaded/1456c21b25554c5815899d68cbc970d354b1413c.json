I think we are entitled to be happy with the way we played and it is a bit of a blueprint for us. There are no excuses now to dip from that. It is the standard for us. Hopefully we can get better but we can\u2019t drop that standard at this level of football.\n\nChelsea leave it late but Michy Batshuayi makes the difference at Ajax Read more\n\n\u201cIt answers questions because the younger players are still babies in Champions League minutes. This was a huge test for them and football continues to give you tests all the time. So I don\u2019t want to say that they are there or this is it. But there was a balance tonight, with the young players who are learning quickly and the experienced players around them who are there to set examples.\u201d\n\nLampard had words of praise for Pulisic, the \u00a358m summer signing from Borussia Dortmund who has struggled so far to establish himself. \u201cHis performance tonight and his last couple of performances off the bench show something \u2013 he\u2019s made differences. I\u2019ve basically tried to shut my ears to much of the outside talk. With a big player, there\u2019s a lot said and if you listen to it all the time, you can wonder what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cI understood the quality of Christian. I understood his young age and it\u2019s a big move for him to Chelsea. And I have other options for him in those areas. Let\u2019s give him full credit. He wants to know what I want for him, what the Premier League is like, what his new teammates are like and that\u2019s not always going to be an easy road.\u201d", "description": "Frank Lampard has urged his Chelsea side to sustain what he called a new \u2018blueprint\u2019 after their impressive victory over Ajax in Amsterdam", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/649cc3e61b133bd6cabbffc910732ba93ff8d5cf/0_70_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bfddab874713a74fbccaf8675bcdf092", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
