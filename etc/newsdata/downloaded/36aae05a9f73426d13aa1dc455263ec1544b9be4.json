Partridge certainly didn\u2019t have Trump in mind when he penned the song. In fact, he wrote the song after impaling a rotting jack-o-lantern on a post and letting his creative mind flow to the question of what that pumpkin did to deserve such a fate.\n\n\u201cWhat did he do to deserve to be executed \u2014 to be put on a spike on Traitor\u2019s Gate here? \u2026 And then I thought, \u2018Hmm, what would happen if there was somebody on Earth who was kind of perfect? \u2026 And the more I thought about it, the more I thought, \u2018God, they\u2019d make so many enemies,\u2019 \u201d Partridge said in an interview years ago, American Songwriter reported.\n\nA little musing here. A little extrapolation there. A bit of imaginative expression here and there.\n\nVoila: These words were born.\n\n\u201cPeter Pumpkinhead \u2026 made too many enemies. Of the people who would keep us on our knees,\u201d one excerpt from \u201cThe Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\u201d goes.\n\nAnother: \u201cPeter Pumpkinhead put to shame, Governments who would slur his name. Plots and sex scandals failed outright.\u201d\n\nThe music video of this song features clips of John F. Kennedy-esque characters.\n\nIt could just as easily feature Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s Trump accusing the existence of a Deep State; Trump fighting off outrageous claims in a dossier; Trump battling accusations from porn star Stormy Daniels and her seedy attorney Michael Avenatti.\n\nIt\u2019s Trump going toe-to-toe, head-to-head with elite Republicans In Name Only politicians; fielding constant fire from hate-filled, angry Democrats, liberals, progressives and socialists; running afoul of America\u2019s intelligence community \u2014 and showcasing the ingrained, ugly political side of the supposedly non-partisan intelligence community; batting away one impeachment call after another.\n\nIt\u2019s Trump, with his MAGA and America First messages, making too many enemies of those in the high-brow, establishment political class who simply want to control, regulate and rule the rest of us. It\u2019s Trump blasting away at members of the media, many of whom have shown themselves more aligned with anti-American forces than with the good patriotic citizens they\u2019re supposedly in business to serve.\n\nPartridge, in his song, sounds a warning. Peter Pumpkinhead was ultimately killed \u2014 crucified, in fact.\n\nBut hope springs eternal.\n\n\u201cHanging there, he looked a lot like you and an awful lot like me,\u201d the ballad wraps.\n\nThe takeaway? America is a spirit, buoyed by those who, like Trump, like Trump supporters, fight more for the individual, more for the preservation of God-given rights, over that of the collective, over that of Big Government. And memo to those \u201cwho would keep us on our knees,\u201d subservient and cowed to silence: A spirit outlasts and overcomes even the most vicious of political designs.\n\nWhen Trump goes, America\u2019s spirit of freedom will still reign.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only Peter Pumpkinhead around.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
