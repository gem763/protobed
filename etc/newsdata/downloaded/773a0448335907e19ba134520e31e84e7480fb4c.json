Emma Ashford, a research fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, tweeted:\n\nThe most depressing part of this administration: Trump\u2019s willingness to consider dialing down America\u2019s military interventions is routinely met with more bipartisan criticism than his violation of constitutional norms or the rule of law.\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal is a betrayal\n\nMany at home and abroad have condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s decision as a cruel abandonment of faithful allies in need. As Ben Hubbard reported for The Times, the prospect of a Turkish military invasion has sparked a sense of both deep fear and indignation among Syrian Kurds.\n\n\u201cThere were assurances from the United States of America that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region,\u201d the Syrian Democratic Forces spokesman, Kino Gabriel, said in a television interview, adding that the \u201cstatement today was a surprise and we can say that it is a stab in the back for the S.D.F.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Coalition, the political wing of the S.D.F., said in a statement:\n\nOur brave men and women with the Syrian Democratic \u00adForces have just won a historic victory over the ISIS \u201ccaliphate,\u201d a victory announced by President Trump and celebrated across the world. To abandon us now would be tragic.\n\nIn the United States, people across the political spectrum joined Lindsey Graham in sharing the S.D.F.\u2019s sentiment. \u201cWhat the U.S. just did in quitting Northern Syria and abandoning one of our strongest allies the Kurds sends a chilling message to would-be allies around the world,\u201d the conservative commentator S.E. Cupp said. \u201cDon\u2019t bother committing to us, because we aren\u2019t committed to you.\u201d\n\nSenator Chris Murphy of Connecticut tweeted along similar lines:", "description": "Withdrawing troops in Syria pleases Turkey but endangers Kurds fighting the Islamic State.", "authors": ["Spencer Bokat-Lindell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/opinion/08debatable/08debatable-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
