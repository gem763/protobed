Thank you very much. You worked very hard on this \u2026 Great job, really great job, honey.\u201d\n\nThen, when the dinner was over, around 11 p.m., after the Trumps had farewelled their last guests and thought nobody was watching, stragglers who turned around on their way out the door glimpsed a spontaneous intimate moment: a husband and wife clinched in tight embrace, he whispering in her ear, she leaning in with a smile.\n\nIt was a scene familiar to any couple who has savored the afterglow of a successful social event.\n\nIn fact, by all reports, the state dinner, only the second for the Trump White House, was an unmitigated triumph and a coming of age for an increasingly sure-footed first lady.\n\n\u201cIt was the most magnificent, spellbinding, magical night crafted out of the imagination of Mrs. Trump,\u201d said Morrison afterward, admitting to being \u201covercome\u201d by tears when the military orchestra played the iconic Australian song \u201cWaltzing Matilda.\u201d\n\nAustralian golfer Greg Norman, who had been seated next to Mrs. Trump, declared on Instagram that it was \u201cthe best event I have ever attended. EVER!\u201d\n\nHenry Kissinger reportedly told Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney it was one of the best official functions he had attended, high praise from a 96-year-old statesman whose career serving presidents began in the Nixon administration.\n\nAll this would be news to style-meisters of the media who have sneered at the first lady\u2019s taste since she moved into the White House, which they anticipated would soon be tricked up in gold tack \u00e0 la Trump Tower.\n\nThey even slammed her when she unveiled White House Christmas decorations \u2014 too white one year and too \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d red the next.\n\nBut, according to Texas author Jennifer Pickens, who will include Friday\u2019s dinner in an upcoming book, \u201cEntertaining at the White House: Decades of Presidential Traditions,\u201d the criticism is off-base.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump has impeccable taste,\u201d said Pickens, who has previously interviewed White House staff involved in the dinner.\n\n\u201cShe oversees every detail herself. She cares about the way things look, smell, taste and the way they feel.\u201d\n\nShe said Mrs. Trump, who briefly studied architecture at the University of Ljubljana in her native Slovenia, wanted this dinner to be a more \u201cintimate affair\u201d than events under previous administrations \u2014 many held in big tents on the South Lawn.\n\nThe first lady spent months meticulously planning \u201cevery detail of the state dinner,\u201d said her spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, \u201cincluding the menu, decor, seating and entertainment.\u201d\n\nMrs. Trump decorated the Rose Garden like \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d-meets-\u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d the tables laden with yellow roses and presidential plates chosen in Australian colors of green and gold.\n\nIt was her idea to have an al fresco dinner in the Rose Garden, and she told one guest she had been praying it wouldn\u2019t rain.\n\nAs it happened, the weather gods delivered a balmy Washington evening.\n\nIt was the kind of event that would receive a rapturous write-up in Vogue had Michelle Obama organized it. But despite Melania being tailor-made for fashion magazines, they turn up their noses.\n\nUnlike her husband, the first lady is reluctant to blow her own trumpet, saying through Grisham only that she was \u201cvery happy with the end result.\u201d\n\nBut the president could barely contain his pride in his wife\u2019s accomplishment and, judging by their stolen embrace at night\u2019s end, the regard was mutual.\n\nTheirs may be one of those lucky marriages that thrive on adversity. Too bad for the haters.\n\nBitter Warren heading for no-man land\n\nReaders shared my disdain for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s denigration of men\u2019s role in history during her rally at Washington Square Park last week.\n\nMarissa, who describes herself as a 62-year-old gay conservative, wrote she was \u201csickened by the attack on the male population. I had a wonderful father, grandfather, uncle and many men in my life who I loved and still love fiercely.\u201d\n\nShe also credits men with saving her life after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, when she worked on the 98th floor of Tower 2.\n\n\u201cMany, many of the men on my floor gathered us all up and told us to get to safety. Two of them, Eric Eisenberg and Gary Herrold, whom I worked with at Aon, knew something was terribly wrong. They made sure we got away from the windows, led us to the stairs and they stayed behind to help others. They did not survive.\u201d\n\nTruth about \u2018supremacy\u2019\n\nDemocrats scowled when Blexit leader Candace Owens told a congressional hate crimes hearing Friday that white supremacy today is a \u201cfringe occurrence\u201d that pales in comparison to father absence, illiteracy and abortion as threats to black America.\n\nWith her proud 75-year-old grandfather behind her, Owens described his childhood \u201con a sharecropping farm in the segregated South \u2026 where words like racism and white nationalism held real meaning under the Democratic Party\u2019s Jim Crow laws.\u201d\n\nNo one in good conscience would argue, she said, that America is a \u201cmore racist, more white nationalist society than it was when my grandfather was growing up.\u201d\n\nBrilliant.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a real marriage, very affectionate,\u201d said one Australian official who observed it up close and personal during the three-day state visit.", "authors": ["Miranda Devine", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/donald-melania-trump.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
