REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nIn a letter to California Air Resource Board chief Mary Nichols, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the state \u201chas failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act,\u201d and not produced timely plans to meet targets for ambient air quality goals.\n\nThe EPA said California must withdraw inactive plans that would most likely be denied. If the EPA rejects a plan, it could trigger \u201chighway funding sanctions, which could result in a prohibition on federal transportation projects and grants in certain parts of California,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nCalifornia is set to receive just over $4 billion in federal highway funding in the budget year that starts Oct. 1.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom described the EPA\u2019s position as a \u201cthreat of pure retaliation. While the White House tries to bully us and concoct new ways to make our air dirtier, California is defending our state\u2019s clean air laws from President (Donald) Trump\u2019s attacks.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has imposed strict state limits on vehicle emissions in defiance of Trump\u2019s attempts to roll back regulations. Those tailpipe emissions are regulated separately from ambient air pollutants, but California argues the vehicle rules are essential to meeting those goals.\n\nTuesday\u2019s move was the latest flashpoint in conflicts between the state and federal governments. The Trump administration this year withheld $929 million from California\u2019s high-speed rail project awarded in 2010, prompting the state to sue.\n\nThe Justice Department has opened a probe into four automakers that struck a voluntary emissions deal with California. Trump has promised EPA action against San Francisco over its homelessness problem and attendant pollution.\n\nEPA officials denied the letter was politically motivated. They say California has the largest backlog of state implementation plans to address ambient air quality standards.\n\nLast week, the EPA said it was taking the unprecedented step of revoking California\u2019s ability to set tailpipe emissions standards and require zero emission vehicles.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the \u201cthreat to withhold California\u2019s highway funding over clean air quality reports is the height of hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nSierra Club Global Climate Policy Director John Coequyt said blocking the state\u2019s tailpipe emissions limits will make it harder to improve air quality.\n\nOn Tuesday, the state of California filed its 29th environmental lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the EPA\u2019s determination that 1,365 acres (552 hectares) of salt ponds in Redwood City are not \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the Clean Water Act.", "description": "The Trump administration on Tuesday escalated its fight with California over environmental issues by threatening to withdraw billions of dollars in federal highway funds because of poor air quality in the state.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433497633&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1C8", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
