Although all three carry estimates, a number of the other lots are offered without reserve, meaning the potential to bag a bargain.\n\nThe first is a 1983 Ferrari 308 GTBi, which is estimated to fetch between \u00a330,000 and \u00a335,000. It is one of only seven cars to be produced in white from a run of 494 and requires sympathetic recommissioning, having stood in storage for 11 years.\n\nIt is being offered at an online auction held by H&H on October 2.\n\nThis manual example displays only 39,196 miles and the owner states that it has had no issues since he bought it in 2005, when the car was imported from Switzerland, meaning that the steering wheel is on the left.\n\nIt comes with extensive service history, a complete toolkit, spare set of keys and the original Ferrari owner's wallet and booklets. Its DDR308B registration will be sold with the car.", "description": "No fewer than three \u201cbarn find\u201d cars are coming up at an exclusively online auction next week.", "authors": ["Paul Hudson", "Dr Ken German"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2019/09/25/Ferrari-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4cmjjr3qcCzR04gVK553qWZPKGjlZYOa58l8tzTrRPg.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
