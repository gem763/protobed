However, Sotomayor wrote an opinion that Ginsburg joined denouncing the court\u2019s action as a moral abdication that puts the lives of thousands at risk.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Anyone who has passed through another country (ie, anyone but Mexicans) is going to be denied asylum. For some, that will be a death sentence. The cruelty is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s action on Wednesday evening put a hold on a series of lower-court rulings that blocked Trump\u2019s policy nationwide and then narrowed those injunctions to effectively cover only a portion of the border with Mexico. The high court ruling leaves the Trump administration free to apply the new policy to immigrants who crossed the southwestern border from mid-July onward. It does not apply to those who arrived earlier or who enter the U.S. by boat or plane.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar \u2014 an appointee of President Barack Obama \u2014 twice blocked the policy nationwide, only to have the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cut the injunctions back to the border states in its geographic jurisdiction, California and Arizona. That left the administration free to implement the policy along the border in Texas and New Mexico, which are under the authority of other appeals courts.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday night, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley echoed the administration\u2019s bitter complaints about a single judge\u2019s seeking to block a major policy shift nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe district court\u2019s erroneous nationwide injunction was another in a series of overreaching orders that allowed a single, non-elected district court judge to override policy decisions for the entire Nation,\u201d Gidley wrote. \u201cWhile there is much more work still to be done, thankfully the Supreme Court took a decisive step here and rejected the lower court\u2019s egregious ruling.\u201d\n\nThe so-called safe-third-country policy, issued as a fast-track regulation in July , was blocked by Tigar on the grounds that it appeared to violate longstanding federal law and was enacted arbitrarily.\n\nThe Supreme Court stay will terminate if the high court later declines to take up the case.\n\nIn her dissent, Sotomayor called the Trump administration\u2019s request to halt the lower court\u2019s injunction an \u201cextraordinary\u201d step.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the court acquiesces,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBecause I do not believe the government has met its weighty burden for such relief, I would deny the stay.\u201d\n\nThe injunctions blocking the policy were issued as part of a suit brought in July by the ACLU, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of immigrant-rights groups.\n\nThe 9th Circuit has scheduled arguments for Dec. 2 on Tigar\u2019s initial preliminary injunction. Even if the appeals court rules quickly, it will probably be past the time for the Supreme Court to take up that ruling this term, unless the justices agree to an unusual acceleration of the case.\n\nAnother suit challenging the policy is pending in Washington, but the judge in that case already turned down an injunction request. Even if he reverses himself or appeals judges step in, it seems likely that any injunction that might be issued in that case would face a similar fate as Tigar\u2019s injunctions did Wednesday.\n\nJadwat, the ACLU attorney, also expressed bitterness that the high court was effectively nullifying the impact of the lower-court litigation.\n\n\u201cCalling balls and strikes, or announcing the winner before the game\u2019s been played?\u201d Jadwat wrote on Twitter, referencing Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 assurance during his confirmation hearings that the Supreme Court should act like a baseball umpire.
