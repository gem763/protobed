Riders don't tip automatically, but only if they are happy with the service. Hence, tips provide incentives to drivers.'\n\nThe study also found some gender division in Uber tipping habits.\n\nMen are 23 percent more likely than women to tip their drivers, and men gave slightly larger tips to women drivers than men, an average of 12 percent compared to 11 percent.\n\nAfter years of criticism, Uber added the option to tip in 2017 as part of their '180 Days of Change program'\n\nUber had resisted adding a tipping feature for years, before finally adding it as part of its '180 Days of Change' program in 2017.\n\nThe company attempted to explain its policy by saying it wanted its drivers to know they were all paid according to the same rates and rules.\n\nBy allowing rider tips, the company would no longer be able to control those fair standards of pay.\n\nThe company also worried drivers would adapt by avoiding neighborhoods where tipping was less common, creating coverage imbalances.\n\nDrivers earned an extra $50 million in the first month after Uber introduced the tipping option.\n\nA 2018 study from MIT found two-thirds of Uber drivers earned less than minimum wage from the ride sharing app.\n\nUber disputed the findings and said the per-hour pay was $13.04.\n\nResearchers countered this figure didn't take into account expenses, maintenance, self-employment taxes and other work-related costs riders had to pay.", "description": "A new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research reveals a shocking finding about Uber passengers: Most of them are profound cheapskates.
