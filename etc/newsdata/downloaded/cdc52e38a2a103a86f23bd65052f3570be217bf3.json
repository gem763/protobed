There are men who crave something but struggle to identify what it legitimately can be.\n\nCan you nod vigorously about diversity during the day then celebrate Jordan Belfort by night? Or, as Sigmund Freud argued, is there no such thing as a joke? My wife, it seems, leans towards Freud. She barely tolerated the endless scenes of prostitutes in the film. When I suggest coming to the immersive version, she discovers she has other plans. This left me alone to find out whether I could be a Wolf of Wall Street, and whether I even wanted to be.\n\nIt's opening night and I'm on the ground floor of what feels like a construction site with several bouncers. By coincidence, it's the same day that Justin Trudeau has been apologising for dressing up in blackface. Finally, something that makes the Wolf look progressive.\n\nBefore I even arrived, however, I knew that this would not be full-throttle Wolf: out go the dwarf-throwing and goldfish-swallowing; in come gender-diverse toilets and vegan and gluten-free meal options.\n\nIn the film, Belfort recounts the various strengths of his drug stupors \u2013 including the \u201ctingle phase\u201d, the \u201cslur phase\u201d and the \u201cdrool phase\u201d. In the theatre, \u201cany patron found in the possession of any illegal substances will be removed and banned from the premises\u201d.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, left, and Kyle Chandler in The Wolf of Wall Street. Roadshow\n\nAt least we\u2019ll be able to unfurl wads of $US100 bills like true Stratton Oakmont brokers, right? \u201cPlease note,\u201d says the show\u2019s website, \u201cthe bar is CARD ONLY.\u201d Have these guys even seen the film?\n\nThere\u2019s a sign warning us of simulated sex scenes. A staff member\u2019s T-shirt says: \u201cConsent is Essential\u201d. The loudspeaker warns us early on that we may be \u201ctriggered\u201d, and there is a \u201csafe space\u201d located in the building. These things are only ironic because they are so off-brand \u2013 like a Formula One car with a cycle rack.\n\nBut if the act has changed, then the audience hasn\u2019t necessarily. I surveyed my fellow wannabe Masters of the Universe. The men who go to immersive Wolf, I discover, are the type who put one hand against the wall when they use a urinal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been to immersive theatre before, the premise is you can either become a trader with Belfort or an investigator helping the FBI take him down. \u201cYou\u2019re either with him or you\u2019re against him,\u201d the blurb screams.\n\nThe set-up starts with Roula Khalaf, a Forbes journalist (and now deputy editor of the Financial Times), visiting Oakmont\u2019s offices. In real life, and now in art, Khalaf exposed Belfort\u2019s dodgy practices, which attracted more greedy traders to the firm, as well as raising the suspicions of the FBI. The show chronicles how Belfort and his allies kept living life to the full, before desperately smuggling millions of dollars to Switzerland, as the FBI circled.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get to choose our team and were swept up in groups of 10-20 by whichever character was nearby, and led to a room to watch part of the plot unfold. The upshot is that we spent the night not quite sure whether we were in the right place. \u201cDownstairs they\u2019re working for the f---ing good guys,\u201d lamented one audience member who was with the FBI. By the good guys, of course, he meant the bad guys.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nFor the ambitious, this was no problem: they simply walked through the makeshift plywood doors, and joined a different group. I stayed with the FBI for a while \u2013 out of politeness, rather than morality.\n\nThe Wolf holds the Guinness World Record for swearing in a film, with the F-word alone used at a rate of 2.81 times per minute for nearly three hours. The theatre is true to this legacy. Almost the first words that I heard were \u201cExcuse me, Denise. Get the f--- out of here.\u201d That rather set the tone.\n\nThe blurb assured attendees, \u201cIf you prefer to observe from the sidelines, nobody will mind.\u201d In past immersive theatre in New York and London, the problem has been overparticipation with reports of audience members assaulting and groping the actors.\n\nSo the immersive Wolf\u2019s actors are equipped with personal alarms and security guards loom in the background. This does rather limit the chances for participation. When one (female) audience member helpfully tried to stuff dollars in the top of an actor \u2013 who was smuggling cash to Switzerland \u2013 she was politely told her assistance was not required.\n\nBut when we could join in, we did. \u201cWhen I say Stratton \u2013 you say Oakmont,\u201d instructs a character. \u201cStratton!\u201d We responded: \u201cOakmont!\u201d After a few renditions, I\u2019m not even sure we were being ironic. It was quite cathartic. I was less sure about the next chant: \u201cF--- the press.\u201d That one was not so cathartic and definitely ironic, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wolf film did not simply celebrate corruption; it may have embodied it. The US justice department alleges that it was financed partly by money stolen from Malaysia\u2019s national 1MDB fund. The producer, Riza Aziz, faces trial in Malaysia accused of laundering $US248 million; he denies the charges. (The film was never screened in Malaysia, because of its explicit content.)\n\nIn my three and a half hours at the show, I didn\u2019t see anyone get hurt \u2013 or any audience members out of control. But a sizeable proportion of us attendees were champing at the bit, desperate to see what we could get away with.\n\nWhen Belfort and his number two, Donnie, dig into a bottle of pills, a drunk man in pinstripes and red braces starts heckling. \u201cShare them out!\u201d he says, evidently keen to put the toxic in toxic masculinity. \u201cSharing is caring! Sharing is caring!\u201d\n\nAt one point, a stranger tries surreptitiously to put a fake $US100 note on my head. He then pretends he hasn\u2019t done it. Who acts like that? Do social norms break down this quickly? I worry that I have signed up for a theatrical re-enactment of the Stanford prison experiment.\n\nA scene from the film version of The Wolf of Wall Street. Supplied\n\nAt least I was there alone. Another man wants to leave the remains of his can of beer. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re drunk?\u201d says a co-worker. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal! You\u2019ve got to finish it.\u201d There is a moment in the latter stages of the show when an audience member, participating in the plot, pretends for a joke to be a woman. \u201cNon-binary!\u201d shouts his friend, laughing. Would he have shouted that in the office?\n\nBelfort himself is now at peace with the law. He was released from jail in 2006 and works as a motivational speaker on ethics and integrity (of course). \u201cGreed is not good. Greed is destructive. It\u2019s ambition that\u2019s good,\u201d he tells audiences. \u201cMoney comes as a byproduct of giving value . . . I had it backwards.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful sentiment, which has no place in the immersive Wolf. Belfort sells morality in his motivational speeches, and amorality in his theatre production. Heads he wins, tails you lose.\n\nWe indulge Belfort because we are nostalgic for an age of one-dimensional masculinity.\n\nThe theatrical Wolf is directed by Alexander Wright, whose previous immersive outing, The Great Gatsby, is moving to the West End in October. The show has an ad hoc feel. The actors often struggle to keep the attention of groups of tipsy office workers. There are some twists and enjoyable singalongs to Nirvana, Radiohead and Whitney Houston. However, you can\u2019t replace Martin Scorsese that easily.\n\nThe script is not that rich or funny, leaving a lot to the physicality of the performances. Ollie Tilney, playing Belfort, captures some of the demented energy of DiCaprio. Razak Osman, as an FBI agent, and Naail Ishaq, as a trader, inject fun. The American accents will presumably improve during the show\u2019s run. Meanwhile, the stage version of Khalaf (Ivy Corbin) has dyed blond hair and can\u2019t function without coffee. Is that true to life? Of course it isn\u2019t, but this is a show about a trader who worked on Long Island but dubbed himself the \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d. Accuracy isn\u2019t included in the ticket price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike other tales of financial wrongdoing, such as Michael Lewis\u2019 The Big Short or Margin Call, starring Kevin Spacey, the Wolf doesn\u2019t explain the intricacies of the money markets \u2013 it focuses on the psychology of those who want money and women. It is a celebration: you want Belfort to succeed, because if not, why are we all here?\n\nI didn\u2019t learn how to sell stocks, but I imbibed the idea that Belfort was a pioneering rogue \u2013 instead of a crook who stole people\u2019s savings. If the National Crime Agency had stormed the building at the show\u2019s end, I wouldn\u2019t have given away the boss\u2019 whereabouts.\n\nThe real Belfort is a master salesman. In the film he hammers home that the first step to selling anything is to create a pressing demand \u2013 you\u2019re selling a pencil, convince your shopper that they need to write something down. Does the immersive Wolf convince the audience that they should aspire to be \u201cbloodthirsty brokers\u201d? Or does it sate that desire to misbehave?\n\nI had the sense that there is a gap in the market for firms where everyone acts like a juvenile jerk.\n\nI felt more the latter. Pumping stocks by phone is no longer a career option; anyway, most of us audience members were the wrong side of 30 (Belfort was out of business aged 34, convicted by 37). The creepier corners of the City are being dusted clean: Lloyd\u2019s of London, the insurance market, has banned boozy lunches, and promised to improve standards after finding that almost 500 employees had witnessed sexual harassment in the past year.\n\nBut I also had the sense that there is a gap in the market for firms where everyone acts like a juvenile jerk. We indulge Belfort because we are nostalgic for an age of one-dimensional masculinity. Emotional depth and shared parental leave still aren\u2019t for everyone.\n\nAbout 10.30pm, I wander to the exit to find that pinstripes \u2013 his red braces still on, his demand for drugs still unsatisfied \u2013 is trying to re-enter the building. The bouncer blocks his path.\n\nAs I leave I recall a joke from the late comic Jeremy Hardy who said of a politician: \u201c[She\u2019s] a character, in the sense that it would be better if she were fictional.\u201d That\u2019s how I feel about Jordan Belfort. Maybe I don\u2019t need to meet the real wolves of Wall Street. Maybe I am paid enough after all.", "description": "Can you nod vigorously about diversity during the day then celebrate Jordan Belfort by night?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4915%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e231c60d703e6bbeba86989b847c2bfe28f8346a", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
