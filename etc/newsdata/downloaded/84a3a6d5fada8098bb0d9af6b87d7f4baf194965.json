But that doesn't undermine the fantastic longer term performance (measured over five years). In that time, the share price has soared some 326% higher! So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Future Lifestyle Fashions\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver half a decade, Future Lifestyle Fashions managed to grow its earnings per share at 51% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nNSEI:FLFL Past and Future Earnings, October 27th 2019 More\n\nWe know that Future Lifestyle Fashions has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store?

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Future Lifestyle Fashions the TSR over the last 5 years was 333%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nFuture Lifestyle Fashions's TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 11%. We should note here that the five-year TSR is more impressive, at 34% per year. Although the share price growth has slowed, the longer term story points to a business well worth watching.
