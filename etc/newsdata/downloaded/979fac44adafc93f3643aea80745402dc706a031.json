I don\u2019t know what I would have done if a friend hadn\u2019t been able to help me out when I needed it. I was really lucky that the timing worked out and I had a friend that could help \u2013 most people wouldn\u2019t have this,\u201d Anna said.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Latest figures show councils built just over 2,500 homes last year \u2013 the highest level since 1992 \u2013 but need to be able to do so much more,\u201d he said.\n\nIt comes after government figures revealed the number of families considered homeless in England had surged by 11 per cent in three years, with a household now found to be without a home every four minutes.\n\nThe number of older people aged over 60 falling into homelessness has also surged, rising by 39 per cent over the last five years, according to figures.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cHousing is a priority for this government and last year we built more homes than in all but one of the last 31 years.\n\n\u201cSince 2010 we\u2019ve delivered 430,000 affordable homes and to protect renters we\u2019ve cracked down on rogue landlords, banned unfair fees and capped deposits, saving at least \u00a3240m a year \u2013 helping to ensure access to safe and secure housing for millions.\u201d", "description": "More than 8 million people across England are living in unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable homes, according to a report that captures for the first time the true scale of the housing crisis.
