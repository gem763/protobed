Power lines through forest or brush create additional fire risks.\n\nLast year\u2019s catastrophic Camp Fire \u2014 the deadliest in the state\u2019s history, which wiped out much of the town of Paradise in mere minutes \u2014 is thought to have been sparked by a problematic power line in windy, dry conditions.\n\nThe outages were expected to affect as many as 700,000 customers for several days, closing schools and businesses. In some places, that meant water systems that rely on electricity for pumping and drainage could also be shut down.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times editorial board cautioned against blaming PG&E alone, however, listing several causes:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t PG&E officials who approved housing developments in high-risk areas. In fact, the utility can\u2019t say no to serving those homes, no matter how great the fire risk. The utility also doesn\u2019t make decisions about how the vegetation around their customers\u2019 houses and the forests nearby are managed. Nor is it the utility\u2019s fault that human-caused climate change has created conditions that fuel massive wildfires. That\u2019s a disgrace we all own.\n\nThere is no scientific link between climate change and the recent wildfires, though many scientists believe a warmer, drier California resulting from climate change could make the risk of wildfires greater than it is today.\n\nJoel B.
