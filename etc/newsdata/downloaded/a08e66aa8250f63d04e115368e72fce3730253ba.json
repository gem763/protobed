You know what you want to spend money on, and you prioritise it. You know where you don\u2019t want to spend money, and you minimise that spending. But you\u2019re far from militant, and you can be known to cut loose with your money from time to time, while travelling or perhaps on special occasions. Frugal is fine.\n\nYou\u2019re certainly not a cheapskate. No one wants to be that person, the killjoy at the birthday party or the grocery store or the coffee shop. But we all know a cheapskate. We all resent a cheapskate. (And to be crystal clear, we\u2019re not talking about friends who are broke or simply earn less money than you.\n\nA cheapskate is someone who has the money to kick in along with everyone else, but seeks every opportunity to cut corners and cut costs, even if it means forcing their friends to shoulder extra expenses.) That said, here are a few strategies for dealing with the cheapskates in your life. Because those people are the worst.\n\nDon\u2019t try to argue with them\n\nLook, if someone wants to scrub and reuse the same sheet of aluminium foil 17 times before finally tossing it, it\u2019s their choice. You can\u2019t control anyone\u2019s choices or behaviour but your own. Take a deep breath and recognise that whatever logic this person has about aluminium foil, they\u2019re not likely to change if you snap at them for doing it. There are some habits you just have to let go, no matter how much you hate them.\n\nWhen it comes to cheapskates, it\u2019s best to save your energy for the conversations that truly matter \u2014 like ones about stingy habits that affect you directly. If you\u2019ve had repeated run-ins with someone who refuses to pay their fair share of a restaurant bill or ghosts you when it\u2019s time to chip in, it\u2019s probably time to say something. Prepare to have an honest, open discussion with this person, but don\u2019t be surprised if they get defensive. It may take time before they see the error of their ways.\n\nSet expectations early and often\n\nTo avoid awkward situations and potential resentment, make expectations around money clear long before anyone has to reach for their wallet. Take the always-challenging birthday dinner, where no one is sure if you\u2019ll have individual tabs, one tab, individual tabs with the guest of honour\u2019s meal split evenly among you, or some other configuration. Don\u2019t leave things to chance or back someone into a corner.\n\nInstead, set out expectations early. For instance, your invitation email could specify, \u201cWe\u2019re planning to split the tab evenly and each kick in for Jessica\u2019s meal and drinks, so please plan to bring cash or card for your share.\u201d Or, say you\u2019re planning a bachelor party. For every potential activity you throw out for the consideration by the attendees, provide a cost estimate up front so you don\u2019t end up with a dissenter after the plans are already starting to gel.\n\nIf you set these expectations and someone bows out, don\u2019t guilt trip them about it. Remember, the reason you\u2019re being up front about costs is so you don\u2019t have to argue with them.\n\nBeing direct about costs is one of the best things you can do for all your relationships, if we\u2019re being honest. Getting crystal clear about costs well before it\u2019s time to pay can help everyone involved \u2014 whether they\u2019re comfortable, broke, or somewhere in between \u2014 determine whether they want to spend their money on this particular expense. Being thoughtful: It\u2019s not just for anticipating your cheapskate friend\u2019s responses. It\u2019s for everyone\u2019s peace of mind.\n\nAvoid the activity that bugs you most\n\nThis tactic is for those of you who can\u2019t escape the cheapskates in your life because you\u2019re related to them. You can\u2019t control what they do, but you can take control of how you interact with it. Think of the thing this person does that grinds your gears the most. Can you avoid doing that one rage-inducing activity with them, or reduce the frequency that it takes place?\n\nMake alternate plans\n\nEven if your budget is feeling flush, you could probably take better advantage of free or low-cost events in your area. Suggest you and your tight-fisted friend meet up at such an event. Or, schedule activities that involve little shared planning, like a walk in the park or a bag-lunch picnic. Cheap people love doing free stuff, as does pretty much everyone else. Look at that common ground.\n\nYes, this is the same route you\u2019d take with a friend who doesn\u2019t make as much money as you do, or who\u2019s going through a rough financial patch. Maybe it\u2019s what you suggest when there are just too many days between you and your next paycheck. But if you\u2019ve tried to broach a money discussion before and your cheapskate friend isn\u2019t having it, suggesting a free activity can cut out a money conversation altogether \u2014 even if just for a few hours.\n\nReconsider your friendship\n\nDo a quick gut-check of the past dozen or so times you\u2019ve interacted with the person in question. Do you feel like they take advantage of you to avoid spending money? Are they forcing you to spend more in their refusal to shell out?\n\nMaybe this person waits for you to book a hotel for a destination wedding, asks if they can bunk with you, and then \u201cforgets\u201d to chip in... for a year. Or maybe they arrive to every single party empty-handed (while heavily partaking in everything offered), when everyone else heeded your warning that your barbecue, while overflowing with provided meats, would be BYOB.\n\nIf you can deal with planning around someone\u2019s cheapskate tendencies, your friendship may be fine and dandy. But if it\u2019s wearing on you and your wallet, it may be time to reconsider how much you value that particular relationship. If you\u2019ve already tried talking to someone about how their behaviour impacts you, and they\u2019re impervious to your pleas, it may be hopeless. If you need to save your sanity, remember you\u2019re allowed to leave people out of your life if their behaviour is downright ridiculous.", "description": "It\u2019s one thing to be frugal.
