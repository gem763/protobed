The company says it\u2019s planning to study all options including the sale of the company in its entirety.\n\nMoviePass drew in millions of subscribers, initially luring them with a $10 monthly rate. But that proved unsustainable. Because MoviePass typically pays theaters the full cost of tickets - $15 or more in big cities - a single movie can put the service in the red. The company was forced to make changes. Those efforts, however, never stopped the losses.\n\nIn a letter posted to subscribers on its website, Mitch Lowe, CEO of MoviePass, wrote,\u201d In August 2017, MoviePass began a transformation of the movie going industry by introducing its low monthly price subscription service. Since then, others in the industry have followed our lead. \u201c\n\nMoviePass said it will be providing subscribers with \u201cappropriate\u201d refunds for their period of service already paid for. Subscribers will not need to request a refund or contact MoviePass customer service to receive a refund. Subscribers will not be charged during the service interruption, according to the website.\n\nHelios acquired a majority stake in the subscription service in 2017.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "MoviePass, the movie ticket subscription service that allowed subscribers to buy up to three movie tickets per month for a small fee, shut down Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
