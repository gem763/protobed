Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-lead torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars\u2014emotional & otherwise\u2014inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can\u2019t even begin to talk about kindness,\u2019 Mark wrote on Wednesday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark, too, faced some debate from his followers, who questioned his sentiment and suggested he run for office to see what it was like, as others also wondered why democratic presidents weren\u2019t called out for their perceived \u2018crimes\u2019 while in the position of power.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the star has singled out leaders, after he recently called out at Boris Johnson after he compared leaving the EU to the Hulk breaking free of Bruce Banner\u2019s \u2018manacles\u2019.\n\nMark questioned the comparison and said the prime minister \u2018forgets that the Hulk only fights for the good of the whole\u2019.\n\nThe PM told the Mail on Sunday that he will break the UK out of the EU\u2019s \u2018manacles\u2019 with or without a deal like fictional scientist Bruce Banner, who transforms into the green giant when angered.\n\nThe American actor suggested Mr Johnson\u2019s metaphor was ill-conceived and he tweeted: \u2018Mad and strong can also be dense and destructive.\n\nMark responded to Boris Johnson\u2019s Hulk comments (Picture: Marvel)\n\n\u2018The Hulk works best when he is in unison with a team, and is a disaster when he is alone.\n\n\u2018Plus\u2026 he\u2019s always got Dr Banner with science and reason.\u2019\n\nIt comes after Ellen defended her friendship with Bush, speaking on her show on Monday.\n\n\u2018When we were invited, I was aware that we were going to be surrounded by many other people from different views and beliefs,\u2019 she said, showing a video she took of the star-studded box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018And I\u2019m not talking about politics\u2026 I was rooting for the [Green Bay] Packers. So I had to hide my cheese hat in Portia\u2019s purse.\n\n\u2018During the game they showed a shot of George and me laughing together and people were upset. They thought, \u201cWhy is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u201d\u2019\n\nShe continued, addressing the backlash: \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m friends with George Bush. I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have. We\u2019re all different and I think we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different\u2026\n\n\u2018Just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to be friends with them. When I say, \u201cBe kind to one another,\u201d I don\u2019t only mean only the people who think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
