REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nShares of the company, which gets nearly a third of its annual sales from Asia, fell as much as 5.4%. The stock is the third biggest percentage loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI this year to Wednesday, with an 11% drop.\n\nChina was the worst performing market, the company said, with sales plunging 9% excluding the impact of currency changes.\n\nThe world\u2019s second largest economy expanded at its weakest pace in almost three decades in the third-quarter as the bruising trade war hit factory production, with auto sales slumping for the 15th straight month in September.\n\nThis squeezed demand for 3M\u2019s automotive products such as sound absorption materials and thermal insulation pads used in batteries.\n\nSo far this week, industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) reported weak demand in Asia, including a 29% plunge in construction equipment sales, while toymaker Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) highlighted a hit from the tit-for-tat tariffs.\n\nOverall, 3M\u2019s sales in Asia-Pacific, its biggest market outside the United States, fell 5%. In the United States adjusted sales dropped 1.1% and also came in below the expectations of some analysts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a broader impact on industrial production, broader manufacturing,\u201d in the United States due to the slowing economic growth, said Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman.\n\n3M, known for Scotch tape and Post-it notes, earlier this year announced plans to reduce production and cut 2,000 workers as its sales slowed.\n\n\u201cWe believe investors anticipated a weak quarter and guide down. Operationally, this appears worse,\u201d Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch wrote in a note.\n\n3M lowered its full-year adjusted earnings expectations to be between $8.99 and $9.09 per share, down from its prior outlook of $9.25 to $9.75.\n\nNet income attributable to the company rose to $1.58 billion, or $2.75 per share, in the quarter, from $1.54 billion, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier, helped by a divestment gain.\n\nNet sales fell 2% to $7.99 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $8.16 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "3M Co on Thursday became the latest U.S manufacturer to signal American corporations are suffering from the trade war with China, after it reported quarterly revenue well short of Wall Street estimates and cut its full-year profit forecast.", "authors": ["Ankit Ajmera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444458650&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0TP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
