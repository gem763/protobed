Some Democrats have warned that his misstatements and gaffes could undermine Mr. Biden\u2019s case that he is the one best placed to beat President Trump. And at least one of his lesser-known Democratic opponents, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, recently said the 76-year-old Mr. Biden was \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment seeped into the debate stage when Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development Secretary, took a shot at Mr. Biden\u2019s memory.\n\nDuring an exchange on Mr. Biden\u2019s health care plan, which would allow people to buy in to a government run option if they chose to or lose their employer-based insurance, Mr. Castro asserted that Mr. Biden said his plan would automatically enroll people in the program, an apparent mischaracterization of Mr. Biden\u2019s own remarks.\n\nMr. Biden pushed back, saying people would \u201cnot have to buy in if you can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can\u2019t believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying they don\u2019t have to buy in,\u201d said Mr. Castro, who is 44. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting that.\u201d\n\nAfter the debate, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign aides called Mr. Castro\u2019s remark a \u201ccheap shot\u201d that mischaracterized Mr. Biden\u2019s health plan.\n\nA few of the Democratic presidential candidates had big moments during the third debate.

This was a conversation about health care policy.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Castro added: \u201cWhen we get on the stage in October 2020 against Donald Trump, does anybody think that he\u2019s going to be the nicest guy in the world?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAfter the debate, as candidates strolled through the \u201cspin room\u201d of media at Texas Southern University\u2019s campus in Houston, several were asked to weigh in on Mr. Biden\u2019s mental sharpness and Mr. Castro\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said on CNN after the debate, adding that Mr. Castro \u201chas every right to call that out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Castro had some really legitimate concerns about, can [Mr. Biden] be someone in a long grueling campaign who can get the ball over the line?\u201d the senator said.\n\nHe said that striking the right tenor was needed when critiquing a fellow Democrat so that the party could unify after the nominating process. Mr. Booker, 50 years old, said he didn\u2019t think Mr. Biden was too old to be president, but added: \u201cThere are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d\n\nAnother presidential contender, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), said on CNN that Mr. Castro was out of line. \u201cI just thought: This is not cool,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that was so personal and so unnecessary.\u201d\n\nJeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.), said campaigns should be hard hitting about issues but not in personal terms. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that Sen. Sanders or I tend to do,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. (Mr. Sanders did challenge the former vice president\u2019s votes as a Senator for the Iraq war.)\n\nSome of the presidential candidates declined to weigh in as all but Mr. Biden faced reporters afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize anyone. I\u2019m here to talk about why I\u2019m running for president,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to the viewer to make their decision,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) said.\n\nDuring the debate, Mr. Biden clashed sharply with Sens. Warren and Sanders over the role of government in the nation\u2019s health-care system, as the three front-runners in the polls faced off for the first time on a debate stage. In addition to the jab about his memory and health plan, Mr. Castro also took a strike at Mr. Biden over immigration.\n\nMr. Biden defended President Obama over his administration\u2019s deportation of undocumented immigrants and deflected about his own personal responsibility for the policies.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d said Mr. Castro, who also had been part of the administration. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Castro told Mr. Biden.\n\nThe former vice president shot back: \u201cThat\u2019ll be a surprise to him.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ken Thomas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "description": "During the third Democratic presidential debate, the candidates differed on whether it was fair to discuss former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s fitness to be the party\u2019s presidential nominee next year.", "authors": ["Joshua Jamerson", "Joshua.Jamerson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106927/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
