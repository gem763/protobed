Since his complaint was the key trigger that now has the House rushing to impeach President Trump, the American people plainly ought to know which candidate that was \u2014 and what the work was.\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff ought to announce the information. If he doesn\u2019t, then The New York Times should reveal it.\n\nThe Times, you see, knows exactly who the whistleblower is. Indeed, it\u2019s already made some information about him public \u2014 including that he\u2019s a male CIA employee who was temporarily on duty at the White House.\n\nThe paper, which claims it wants to protect whistleblower confidentiality, released that info because it bolstered the credibility of his complaint.
