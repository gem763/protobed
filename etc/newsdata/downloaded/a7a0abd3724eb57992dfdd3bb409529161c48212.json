As the seasons transition and weather forecasts shift with reckless abandon, it's becoming more difficult to tell whether it's going to rain later during the day.\n\nThat's not good news for your shoes, because if you end up wearing the wrong ones, your feet are trapped in the unholy embrace of wet socks. Even worse, you could also permanently ruin the material of your favorite pair of shoes.\n\nOnline shoe brand Allbirds knew that its fans were starting to store away their shoes come fall and winter time in order to protect the wool construction. Now, it has two new shoes that let you enjoy soft comfort and support no matter the weather conditions.\n\nThe new Mizzle collection features the Wool Runner Mizzle and the Wool Runner-Up Mizzle, which are both made with water-resistant merino wool and a reinforced sole for more traction on slippery surfaces.\n\nAllbirds\n\nThe Runner Mizzle looks like the original Wool Runner, while the Runner-Up Mizzle is Allbirds' first high-top sneaker in wool (the Tree Toppers were the brand's first-ever high-top and are made from eucalyptus).\n\nThey're both currently available in four colors. The Runner costs $115, and the Runner-Up $135. They're the most expensive of Allbirds' styles, likely due to the water-resistant treatment and sole design.\n\nAllbirds differentiates these new sneakers from other water-resistant shoes on the market by emphasizing that it uses chemical-free, naturally derived materials to create its water-repellent treatment and water-resistant layer. The company as a whole is geared toward environmentally friendly practices, using materials like sustainably harvested eucalyptus pulp, recycled polyester made from plastic bottles, and carbon-negative EVA foam.\n\nWe tried the new Allbirds Mizzles to test their comfort and claims of water resistance. Our testers include first-time Allbirds wearers and longtime fans.\n\nWool Runner Mizzle review:\n\nAllbirds\n\nI own three different pairs of Allbirds (well, four now!), the original Wool Runners, the Tree Skippers, and the Tree Breezers. The Wool Runners are still my favorite and the pair I wear the most after two years, but I do have to admit it takes a certain bravery to put them on during cold weather season and risk getting them wet. The softness and coziness of wool is exactly why you'd want to wear them when it rains, which is why I love that Allbirds now has a water-resistant version.\n\nSince it didn't rain in the time I had to test the Wool Runner Mizzle, I couldn't test the claims of weather resistance directly. However, I did run them under the water of my faucet, with all the expected trepidation of anyone testing a waterproof or water-resistant product for the first time.\n\nTo my relief and happiness, the water slid right off (this effect was also very satisfying to watch). Some droplets stayed on the surface, but as I watched, they merely lingered there rather than absorb into the wool material. I tried ramping up the flow of the water, and the same thing happened, so I feel fairly confident about the material's performance in a real rain shower. \u2014Connie Chen, reporter\n\nI've somehow never worn Allbirds before trying out the Mizzle. So while I can't compare the new weather-resistant shoes to the original, I can confirm they are as cozy as I hoped wool shoes would be. I tried the Wool Runner Mizzle and immediately felt as if I had swaddled my feet in a soft, warm blanket.\n\nThe fit was near-perfect (there was not even a hint of a blister, straight out of the box), but with one caveat: My big toes hit just a little too close to the front of the shoe. It's something to keep in mind if you're between sizes, or love super thick socks, and might need extra room. But it's not a total dealbreaker. I'm hoping the shoe stretches with use, as I plan to wear these more, rain or shine. \u2014Emily Hochberg, travel editor\n\nWool Runner-Up Mizzle review:\n\nAllbirds\n\nIn my 10 months on the Insider Picks team there isn't a company that has received more praise from my colleagues than Allbirds. Anytime there's a new style or color released I know there's an email thread of excitement on its way. I wasn't sure if the shoes would live up to the hype, but after trying the Wool Runner-Up Mizzle I'm officially a convert.\n\nBeyond the fuzzy exterior that's also somehow water-resistant, the shoes are extremely comfortable right out of the box. The merino wool that lines the interior of the shoe provides a snug, blanket-like feel around my feet, and the bottom of the shoe is soft and squishy, but also supportive. The Runner-Up Mizzles are now my go-to shoe whenever I see a rainy day on my weather app. \u2014 Danny Bakst, content producer\n\nI have three pairs of Allbirds Runners (both Wool and Tree), and they're always my go-to shoes when the first thing I'm looking for is comfort. So I was a little bummed out when I tried my pair of Runner-Up Mizzles. I know I may get drawn and quartered by the Allbirds loyalists of the world for saying this (hey, I'm generally a big fan, too! I'm just doing my job here), but I found this pair to be uncomfortable. The top of the shoe rubs right up against my ankles, which I think is due to the fact that the opening of the shoe is pretty bulky. This is just my personal experience, and while I know the shoes will hold up to crappy weather (we ran water over them and it beaded right up), I don't think they're the pair I'll go for when I'm commuting to work. \u2014 Sally Kaplan, editor\n\nI knew Allbirds was onto something when, during a meeting, one of the participants stopped me in mid-speech to tell me how awesome my Wool Runner-Up Mizzle looked. Indeed, it blends the cool high-top silhouette with the fuzzy wool exterior that Allbirds is known for.\n\nWhile I haven't had the opportunity to wear them long-term, there are some things that I noticed right away. Right out of the box, the Wool Runner-Up Mizzle slipped onto my feet easily and cushioned them with a soft feeling that's reminiscent of how my bedroom slippers feel.\n\nBut like my colleague Emily, I find some areas to be a bit tight, like the big toe and the top of the feet. My feet also feel like they were incubating, so I'd recommend wearing thinner socks to allow for some breathability (although wool absorbs moisture well) or save these for colder weather. However, I really enjoy the soft cushioning of the footbed and sole; I pounded the pavement for several hours and didn't find them uncomfortable, despite having not broken them in. \u2014 Les Shu, buying guides editor\n\nThe bottom line: Prepare for the rainy season with these new Allbirds sneakers.\n\nThe Mizzle is one collection of shoes you can wear out of the house with confidence, no matter how unpredictable the day's weather is. The Runners and Runner-Ups give you the lightweight, supportive comfort of a regular pair of sneakers, but the water-resistant benefits of a pair of bulky boots.\n\nIf you have concerns about the fit and feel of a high-top sneaker around your ankles, we would recommend buying the The Runners instead of the Runner-Ups.
