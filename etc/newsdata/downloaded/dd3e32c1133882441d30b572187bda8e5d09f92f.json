REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nWearing white boiler suits, the roughly 300 protesters sat on the red carpet where Hollywood stars such as Brad Pitt, Scarlett Johansson and Joaquin Phoenix have premiered their latest films during the 11-day event.\n\nWaving banners that read \u2018Our home is on fire\u2019 and \u2018No to cruise ships\u2019, the protesters sat outside the main festival venue and chanted slogans, surrounded by police.\n\n\u201cWe want to address the topic of the climate crisis, we think that it is more important than anything that we can see in the world now,\u201d said Chiara Buratti, a member of the Venice anti-cruise ship committee, adding the demonstrators wanted celebrity backing for their cause.\n\nThe protesters arrived in the early morning but left peacefully several hours later, around 1200 GMT.\n\nSaturday is the last day of the festival, held on the Venice Lido, and the winner of the Golden Lion prize will be announced in the evening. Buratti said the demonstrators were also planning a march elsewhere on the Lido later in the day.\n\nThe protesters, who belong to Italian and foreign groups, were taking part in a five-day Venice Climate Camp event.\n\n\u201cThe climate crisis has no borders, why should we stop at some border and just care about some local problems that we have back home,\u201d said demonstrator Sina Reisch from the German group Ende Gelande. \u201cWe must see that the struggles are connected.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrators got the support of rocker Mick Jagger and veteran actor Donald Sutherland, who will walk that red carpet later to present their thriller \u201cThe Burnt Orange Heresy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am glad they\u2019re doing that because they\u2019re the ones that are going to inherit the planet,\u201d Jagger said at a news conference to promote the movie.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very difficult situation at the moment, especially in the U.S. where all the environmental controls that were put in place, that perhaps were just about adequate say for the last 10 years, are being rolled back by the current administration, so much that they will be wiped out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad people feel so strongly about it they want to protest anywhere whether it\u2019s the red carpet or another place.\u201d\n\nSutherland said environmental protesters had \u201cto fight harder\u201d and \u201cget as much support as they can\u201d, adding those calling for the plight of migrants also needed backing.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re my age ... 85 years old and you have children and grandchildren, you will leave them nothing if we do not vote those people out of office in Brazil, in London and in Washington. They are ruining the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have contributed to the ruination of it but they are ensuring it.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of demonstrators took over the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival for several hours on Saturday, demanding action to fight climate change and a ban on cruise ships entering the lagoon city.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427237065&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860GR", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
