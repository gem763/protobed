Experts warn it raises questions about using the technique for fertility rather than disease\n\n'The main ethical issue (or one of the main issues) that will arise from this Spanish/Greek enterprise is whether using MSTs for treating infertility that is not related to mitochondrial disease is morally permissible,' said Professor C\u00e9sar Palacios-Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nThe trial's leader Dr Nuno Costa-Borges, co-founder of Barcelona-based Embryotools, insists the procedure is far less sinister than critics fear.\n\nHe says it is like egg donation, but in this case 99 percent of the baby's genes come from its mother and father, and just one percent from a third party.\n\n'For some patients, it's very hard to accept that they cannot get pregnant with their own [eggs],' he said.\n\n'Spindle transfer may represent a new era in the IVF field, as it could give these patients chances of having a child genetically related to them.'\n\nThe spindle transfer method was implemented by Embryotools and Athens-based clinic Institute of Life.\n\nDr Panagiotis Psathas, president of Institute of Life, hailed the birth as a medical milestone.\n\n'Today, for the first time in the world, a woman's inalienable right to become a mother with her own genetic material became a reality.\n\n'As Greek scientists, we are very proud to announce an international innovation in assisted reproduction, and we are now in a position to make it possible for women with multiple IVF failures or rare mitochondrial genetic diseases to have a healthy child.\n\n'At the Institute of Life, our commitment is to continue to help even more couples facing fertility issues to have children with their own DNA, without having recourse to egg donors.'\n\nLegal experts warn the trial puts more pressure on the US to think again about its ban on mitochondrial replacement as more countries open the door to aspiring parents around the world.\n\nI. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard health law professor, warned American parents may well seek the treatment elsewhere, and it won't be clear how many three-parent babies are in the country.\n\nHow the maternal spindle transfer is performed\n\n'There is simply no way for any country to truly insulate itself from alterations through mitochondrial replacement therapy entering a country's gene pool,' Cohen told STAT.\n\nTwo three-parent babies have been born using MRT since the procedure was invented, one in Mexico and one in Ukraine - both sparking global controversy.\n\nMitochondrial replacement therapy was first invented at Oregon Health and Science University in 2009 in animal experiments.\n\nBut in 2015, the US banned its use for human pregnancies fearing that it could be a slippery slope to genetic modification.\n\nThat same year, the UK gave the procedure the green light, publishing guidelines on how it could be used.\n\nAnd last year, scientists in Newcastle were granted permission to create Britain's first three-parent babies for two women with heritable genetic diseases.", "description": "The 32-year-old Greek woman had four failed IVF attempts before she heard about the trial by Spanish doctors.
