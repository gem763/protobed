It added that Kim Miyong Gil arrived on Thursday while U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun came on Friday.\n\nBecause the U.S. does not have official diplomatic relations with North Korea, Sweden has often acted as a bridge between Washington and Pyongyang.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/f0/65fa88dd49ef8111c6e15081e601/19105-north-korea-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
