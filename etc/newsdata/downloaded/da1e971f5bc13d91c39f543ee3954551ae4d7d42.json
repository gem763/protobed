(Photo: Caleb Jones, AP)\n\nMIDWAY ATOLL, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands \u2013 A crew of deep-sea explorers and historians looking for lost World War II warships have found a second Japanese aircraft carrier that went down in the historic Battle of Midway.\n\nVulcan Inc. director of undersea operations Rob Kraft and Naval History and Heritage Command historian Frank Thompson reviewed high-frequency sonar images of the warship Sunday and say its dimensions and location mean it has to be the carrier Akagi.\n\nThe Akagi was found in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument resting in nearly 18,000 feet of water more than 1,300 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe researchers used an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, equipped with sonar to find the ship. The vehicle had been out overnight collecting data, and the image of a warship appeared in the first set of readings Sunday morning.\n\nRob Kraft, director of undersea operations at Vulcan Inc., reviews sonar scans of a warship from the World War II Battle of Midway that was found by the crew of the research vessel Petrel on Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019 off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The crew confirmed the ship was the flagship Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi.

The dimensions that we\u2019re able to derive from this image (are) conclusive,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cIt can be none other than Akagi.\u201d\n\nThe vessel is sitting in a pile of debris, and the ground around the warship is clearly disturbed by the impact of the ship on the seafloor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sitting upright on her keel, we can see the bow, we can see the stern clearly, you can see some of the gun emplacements on there, you can see that some of the flight deck is also torn up and missing so you can actually look right into where the flight deck would be,\u201d Kraft said.\n\nRob Kraft, director of undersea operations at Vulcan Inc., reviews sonar scans of a warship from the World War II Battle of Midway that was found by the crew of the research vessel Petrel, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019, off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

But when you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean and everything, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,\u201d said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, D.C., who is aboard the Petrel. \u201cYou see the damage these things took, and it\u2019s humbling to watch some of the video of these vessels because they\u2019re war graves.\u201d\n\nRob Kraft, director of undersea operations at Vulcan Inc., reviews sonar scans of a warship from the World War II Battle of Midway that was found by the crew of the research vessel Petrel, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019, off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

More than 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans died.\n\nAn autonomous underwater vehicle carrying high frequency sonar images of the Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi is loaded onto the research vessel Petrel off Midway Atoll in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

For years, the crew of the 250-foot Petrel has worked with the U.S. Navy and other officials around the world to locate and document sunken ships. It has found more than 30 vessels.\n\nKraft says the crew\u2019s mission started with Allen\u2019s desire to honor his father\u2019s military service. Allen died last year.\n\n\u201cIt really extends beyond that at this time,\u201d Kraft said. \u201cWe\u2019re honoring today\u2019s service members. It\u2019s about education and, you know, bringing history back to life for future generations.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/21/wwii-battle-midway-japanese-aircraft-carrier-found-deep-sea/4052226002/", "description": "Based on the dimensions and location, the ship has been identified as a Japanese aircraft carrier called the Akagi.", "authors": ["Caleb Jones", "Associated Press", "Published A.M.
