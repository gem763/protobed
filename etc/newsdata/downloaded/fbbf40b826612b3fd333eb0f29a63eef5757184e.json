The new roof will come with a 25-year warranty, and be offered in a dark tempered glass finish to start, though Musk said Friday he hopes to unveil new designs \u201cevery six to nine months.\u201d\n\nThe new version of the Solar Roof is the third design Tesla has come up with, and the company says it should be cheaper and quicker to install than version two, which is what Tesla was selling before Friday\u2019s announcement. With version two, Musk told reporters, Tesla was \u201cbasically trying to not lose money\u201d on each installation, in part because that version of the roof needed additional work done after it left the factory and arrived at a home. He called them \u201cquite artisanal,\u201d and compared their installation to \u201cbuilding airplanes and you finish your construction on the runway.\u201d\n\nThis is the third version of the Solar Roof, which was unveiled in 2016\n\n\u201c[It] just wasn\u2019t a version that was worth scaling,\u201d Musk said.\n\nThe new Solar Glass Roof, however, is the first version he feels comfortable scaling production-wise thanks to a simpler design with fewer parts and sub-assemblies. Musk compared the progress to how other technologies tend to need a few iterations before they gain wide adoption. \u201cWindows 1 or 2 didn\u2019t really work, frankly,\u201d he said, presumably referring to Microsoft\u2019s early operating systems.\n\nThe billionaire CEO claimed the new roof tiles, which are bigger and more power dense, will help \u201cmake roofs come alive,\u201d creating a world \u201cwhere you look around the neighborhood and the roofs are all gathering energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think in the future, it will be odd for roofs to not gather energy,\u201d Musk said.\n\nThe promise of the Solar Roof has always been an enticing one. Pay a premium over standard solar panels, and you can get a normal-looking tiled roof that will suck up the sun\u2019s energy all the same. It won\u2019t be for everyone, though. Musk tweeted on Thursday that the Solar Roof will \u201conly make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs.\u201d If a potential customer\u2019s roof is more than five years away from needing to be replaced, he said, they\u2019re better off going with a standard solar panel setup.\n\n\u201cI think in the future, it will be odd for roofs to not gather energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt costs a price point that is less than what the average roof costs plus solar panels,\u201d Musk said on the call.\n\nMusk originally unveiled the Solar Roof in October of 2016 on the set of Desperate Housewives, right around when Tesla was in the middle of acquiring SolarCity \u2014 a company Musk was chairman of, and one founded by his cousins. That deal stirred up a great deal of controversy, with detractors calling it a \u201cbailout\u201d of SolarCity, which had started to struggle after years of growth. A number of Tesla shareholders even sued Musk over the deal, alleging he overvalued SolarCity, and claiming he did not properly recuse himself from the deal. (The lawsuit is still ongoing, and more documents \u2014 including Musk\u2019s deposition \u2014 were unsealed Friday. Tesla and Musk have denied any impropriety.)\n\nThe Solar Roof project itself has been besieged with problems. It was originally supposed to go on sale in 2017, but design issues forced Tesla to delay the launch. Production eventually began in 2018 at the company\u2019s second Gigafactory, a repurposed SolarCity factory in Buffalo, New York, but the rollout of the Solar Roof has been extremely limited while Tesla worked on what Musk referred to as \u201cversion three\u201d of the design.\n\nTesla could use a win on the solar side of the business. The company deployed fewer solar panels in the second quarter of 2019 than in any other quarter since acquiring SolarCity, dropping it to third in the residential solar panel market in the US, and that number just barely ticked up in the third quarter. Tesla tried slashing prices and recently started offering a rental plan for its solar panels, though it\u2019s still too early to tell whether the latter will help the company regain its market lead in the US. Tesla was also sued by Walmart in August, after a number of the retailer\u2019s stores suffered fires allegedly started by Tesla and SolarCity solar panels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite hard to get to this point,\u201d Musk said Friday. \u201cThis was a quite a difficult product because roofs have to last for a long time. And then when you add electrification to the roof,\u201d it gets even more difficult, he said.\n\nTesla says the new roof will be simpler, faster, and more intuitive to install than previous iterations, and that the goal is to install 1,000 roofs per week in the \u201cnext few months.\u201d Musk said he believes the addressable market for the Solar Glass Roof is \u201c100 million homes worldwide.\u201d Musk also said Tesla has two internal installation teams competing on how to best install the new roof (a tactic he recently used with SpaceX\u2019s Starship prototype), and is hiring a lot of installers. But Musk said Tesla will also bring in outside installation companies to figure out how to improve from there.", "description": "Elon Musk has unveiled a redesign of Tesla\u2019s Solar Roof tiles, dubbed \"Solar Glass Roof.\" The new roof design will cost around $42,500 for a 2,000-square-foot roof with 10kW of solar capacity, according to Tesla\u2019s website, though it will vary by size and location.
