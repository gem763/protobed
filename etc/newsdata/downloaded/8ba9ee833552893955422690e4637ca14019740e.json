They left the room that evening literally several news cycles behind\u2014and exasperated at the difficulty of keeping up with it all as they try to keep their eyes on the ball.\n\n\u201cI think we're being constantly invited to change the subject,\u201d remarked Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA), a vocal impeachment proponent, who was not locked away on Thursday but was exhausted by the news all the same. \u201cAnd constantly tempted to focus on the outrage du jour.\u201d\n\nIt has been accepted for some time that Democrats would have a challenge in maintaining the narrow focus they want for their impeachment inquiry\u2014in particular, Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2014given the broad concerns within the caucus about the president\u2019s conduct and his ability to spark fresh controversy daily.\n\nBut as the grab-bag of grounds for investigating Trumpworld grows at a faster pace than Democrats can keep up with, their cautiously plotted inquiry is being stretched in more directions than ever before. And that could open up new spaces for debate and disagreement within the caucus over how the probe should proceed\u2014namely, whether impeachment should be expanded to accommodate any accumulating evidence of wrongdoing, or if other grounds for impeachment should be set aside in order to preserve what has so far been a successful investigation.\n\nThe news that is most testing Democrats on this front is Trump\u2019s G7 gambit, which revived the discussion of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause that prohibits the president from taking any kind of gift or benefit from a foreigner.\n\nMany House Democrats have long believed that Trump has violated the clause due to the steady stream of foreign business at his D.C. hotel and now the steering of a high-profile international conference to his Florida resort. To date, only a small handful of lawmakers have been arguing that this should be a central focus in their impeachment probe\u2014but the brazenness of Trump\u2019s move could change that as the issue is thrust into the spotlight.\n\nA top House progressive, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), told The Daily Beast on Friday that there is a case to be made to write an article of impeachment based on the emoluments issue. \u201cWe have to see how strong we can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, these things are being done in public so it makes it easy.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who was among the first lawmakers to advocate for impeachment on the grounds of emoluments, said Friday there\u2019s \u201cmore than enough\u201d material out there now to write such an article.\n\nHardly any Democrats shrug off the issue of the president\u2019s profiting off his properties, but there\u2019s a genuine split over whether impeachment is the proper way to respond to it. Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) pointed to language in House-passed spending bills that prohibits the administration from spending federal funds at Trump properties, which would make it impossible to host a G7 summit at his Doral hotel.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastWith a slew of depositions of key figures in the impeachment inquiry lined up for next week, House Democrats aren\u2019t anywhere near done compiling evidence of President Trump\u2019s misconduct\u2014and yet in the span of just a few hours this past week they", "authors": ["Sam Brodey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5obwRyS61gSDoCi9kXrZ0A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/5dedaacf8bfeb4540652661be0873a43", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
