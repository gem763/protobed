AGI is set to release third-quarter 2019 results on Oct 30, after the closing bell.\n\n\n\nThe company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter. Its adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents.\n\n\n\nThe stock has gained 23.1% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 62.3% surge.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Factors at Play in Q3\n\n\n\nIn July, the company stated that it expects gold production in the third quarter to be flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Notably, it reported production of 125,200 ounces of gold in the second quarter.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from higher production at the Island Gold mine. The mine has been generating record quantities of gold over the trailing three reported quarters. It produced 75,100 ounces of gold through the first half of this year, driven by the benefit of the Phase 1 expansion. The trend is expected to have continued in the third quarter.\n\n\n\nAlso, higher gold prices are likely to have contributed to Alamos\u2019 third-quarter margins. After a turbulent 2018, gold has had a stellar run in 2019. Uncertainties related to the U.S.-China standoff and geopolitical tensions have triggered demand for gold so far this year. Higher prices are expected to have made a positive impact on the company\u2019s earnings.\n\n\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Says\n\n\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alamos this time around.
