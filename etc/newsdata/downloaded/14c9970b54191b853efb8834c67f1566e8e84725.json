Quiet shrines stand near neon-lit electronics shops, and serene parks edge up against alleyways lined with late-night ramen bars. But it wasn\u2019t always this way: in the 1600s, when Tokyo was still called Edo, it was nothing but a tiny fishing village, until the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu decided to build a castle here. In 1868, it was made the capital, and it is now among the largest cities in the world.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nAsk 100 people what to do in Tokyo and you\u2019ll probably get 100 different answers. I tell people to walk around Ginza. This central neighbourhood is one of Japan\u2019s wealthiest postcodes, where glossy department stores and high-end brands are housed in many of Tokyo\u2019s prettiest buildings, blending the best of Japanese fashion, design and cuisine \u2013 it\u2019s also the heart of Tokyo\u2019s sushi culture. Some of the greatest sushi restaurants on Earth are here, including the immortalised shop of Jiro Ono, star of the Jiro Dreams of Sushi documentary.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ginza\u2019s Sony Park. Photograph: Alamy\n\nWhile in Ginza, also visit Sony Park \u2013 a quirky urban space that often hosts live music \u2013 as well as the tiny shrine of Toyoiwa Inari, hidden down a very narrow alley. Also stop for a drink at Nissan Crossing, a cafe where you can have your face etched on top of your latte in macchi-art for \u00a5400 (\u00a33).\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nA small restaurant in Tokyo\u2019s Ebisu neighbourhood called GEM by Moto. Diners squeeze in on stools around the hardwood counter as they watch owner and sake sommelier Marie Chiba at work. This year, Marie was awarded the Sake Samurai award \u2013 one of the most prestigious achievements in the sake industry \u2013 for her unique pairings at GEM, selecting sake for each customer based on their food choices from the regularly changing blackboard menu. Her most famous pairing, which you can ask for, is that of milky-white doburoku (unfiltered homebrew sake) with a blue cheese and ham cutlet. On the restaurant\u2019s white walls, you\u2019ll find scrawled messages from Marie\u2019s many sake brewers, who travel from across the country to become customers themselves.\n\n\u2022 Small plates from \u00a33.80, 1 Chome-30-9 Ebisu, Shibuya City, on Facebook\n\nWhere to stay\n\nA trip to Tokyo wouldn\u2019t be complete without dipping a toe into the city\u2019s slightly stranger side. A stay at a Henn-na Hotel (meaning strange/weird hotel) will certainly allow you to do that. This chain, of which there are several branches across Tokyo, is almost solely run by robots: some in the shape of people, some in the shape of dinosaurs. You are generally checked in by a robot at reception, with a porter robot to carry your things to your room (plus robotic fish in the fish tank). The latest Henn-na Hotel, which opened on 1 September in Asakusa, even has holographic robot staff who flicker in front of you on the walls. You probably wouldn\u2019t want to spend more than a night or two there, but the rooms are affordable and are in great locations, from Ginza to Maihama (by Tokyo Disneyland). If the robot novelty doesn\u2019t appeal, I also recommend Remm in Hibiya (doubles from \u00a385), a modern hotel that provides a quiet, comfortable night\u2019s sleep in the heart of the city, with rooms featuring rain showers and massage chairs.\n\n\u2022 h-n-h.jp/en,doubles from \u00a355\n\nWhat the guidebooks overlook\n\nTokyo is often said to be the foodie capital of the world, with more Michelin stars than any other city on Earth. But less appreciation is given to the city\u2019s creative brewers, of which there are hundreds. My favourites include Brewin\u2019 Bar in Ginza, where you can try home-brewed craft beers (\u00a36); an amazing urban winery called Fujimaru in Kiyosumi-Shirakawa, with both a restaurant and a wine tasting room; and Wakaze, a brewery that does pop-ups around the city, serving deliciously sour oak barrel-aged sake.\n\nMoving on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Masaaki Ohashi/Getty Images\n\nHead north to nearby Ibaraki prefecture, where nature is in abundance. This is where you\u2019ll find the beautiful Tsukimachi waterfall, one of Japan\u2019s 88 ancient power spots. Here people practise a Buddhist ritual called Takigyo, known as \u201cwaterfall meditation\u201d, a cleansing of the mind and soul achieved by standing under the powerful \u2013 and very cold \u2013 water for anything from several minutes to several hours (something only committed monks achieve). You can rent a traditional shiro shozoku karate-style outfit and try it for yourself (I did it in August), warming up after at Momiji-en, a soba (buckwheat noodle) restaurant that overlooks the maple tree valley. About 12 miles away, you\u2019ll find Japan\u2019s highest bungee jump, which sees visitors throw themselves off a 100-metre-high suspension bridge above colourful Ryujin Gorge. To get to Ibaraki, take the 90-minute Limited Express train from Tokyo to Mito, then the 90-minute local Suigun Line train to Shimonomiya station. Tsukimachi waterfall is a 1\u00bd-mile walk from there. Alternatively, hire a car in Mito for easy access to Ibaraki\u2019s more rural reaches.\n\nInspiration\n\nThere are plenty of great Instagram accounts to follow for tips on Tokyo, including photographer @tokyo_one, who shares beautiful imagery, and @bunnytokyo who shares interesting stories. If you can get your hands on a copy, I also recommend the book series Tokyo Artrip. The books, written in Japanese on one side and English on the other, highlight great places to experience everything in Tokyo from sake and green tea to architecture and antiques.\n\nFixtures\n\nWales v Australia 29 September\n\nEngland v Argentina 5 October\n\nQuarter-final 2 19 October\n\nQuarter-final 4 20 October\n\nThird place play-off 1 November\n\nYokohama Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yokohama has Japan\u2019s biggest Chinatown. Photograph: Alamy\n\nBy Emma Sato, photographer living in Yokohama, @gomphotography\n\nMy city in a nutshell\n\nYokohama is Japan\u2019s second-largest city: it has one of the largest expat communities in the country \u2013 and the largest Chinatown. It may be less than an hour by train from the capital Tokyo (it is actually part of the Greater Tokyo area), but feels far more laid-back \u2013 the streets are uncrowded, easy to walk through and dotted with street art and cool cafes. The growing number of microbreweries in the city add to this youthful spirit, and there are beer festivals throughout the year, including an annual Oktoberfest.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Sean Pavone/Getty Images\n\nSpend the evening in Minato Mirai 21, Yokohama\u2019s harbour area. At night, the sea reflects the city lights like a kaleidoscope. To see the skyline in full, jump on the ferris wheel (\u00a35.30), a 15-minute loop that scoops you up among the skyscrapers. It\u2019s also worth viewing the ferris wheel from afar \u2013 it lights up in five-minute displays on each quarter-hour. The best spots to watch from are either Osanbashi Pier, which juts 50 metres into the water, or Manyo Club (\u00a319), an onsen (hot-spring) facility that has skyline views from the baths. Manyo also has footbaths outside, so you can roll up your jeans and sit back to watch the show.\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nI love a yakitori restaurant called Sumibi Yakitori Azume, where chicken is grilled on skewers over charcoal (yaki: cooked over heat; tori: chicken). There are several tables, but sit at the 10-seater bar if you want a front-row view of the chef turning each skewer on the flames. Almost every part of the chicken is available, from the crispy skin to the liver. Wash it down with a local sake or sweet plum wine \u2013 the bar is lined with bottles.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nProstyle Ryokan is a Japanese-Western fusion hotel that celebrates the fact that Yokohama was the first city in Japan to open its port to the outside world, back in 1859. The hotel\u2019s design reflects this blending of cultures, from the sunken earth floors of traditional Japanese homes to the Western-style bedrooms, with corridors lit by refurbished gas lamps brought to Japan from the west in 1872. In the lobby, you can listen to curated playlists made by the hotel staff, using headphones plugged into record players. They also offer free smartphones for guests to use out and about during their stay.\n\n\u2022 prostyleryokan.com, doubles from \u00a376 room-only\n\nWhat the guidebooks overlook\n\nYokohama\u2019s Koganecho neighbourhood was the city\u2019s red-light district until the government set about gutting the local brothels in 2006, turning them into creative studios and workspaces. Today, the neighbourhood, which lines the northern banks of the Ooka River, is a great place to stroll around, stopping in at the art shops and galleries, or admiring the bright murals painted on the walls.\n\nMoving on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hakone Open Air Museum, with Arch Leg sculpture by Henry Moore.

Hakone\u2019s real lure, though, is its Mount Fuji views. To take in all the sights (including designated \u201cFuji-viewing\u201d spots), follow the \u201cHakone loop\u201d \u2013 a day-long route that winds gently through the mountains and lakes via train, tram, cable car, enormous pirate-styled ship and bus. Don\u2019t leave without trying the famous black eggs of Owakudani, cooked in sulphur water. Locals believe eating one will add seven years to your life. The Hakone Free Pass (\u00a339) allows for unlimited travel in the Hakone area for two consecutive days.\n\nInspiration\n\nFollow: @in_suke_gram, who posts artistic photographs of the city.

Photograph: John S Lander/Getty Images\n\nBy Narumi Abe, musician in the rock band My Bird Warms a Blanket for Colette, @narumiabe_perdrart\n\nMy city in a nutshell\n\nSapporo sits on the west coast of Hokkaido, Japan\u2019s mountainous northern island. The cold Sea of Okhotsk, to the north, has some of the world\u2019s richest fishing waters, and Sapporo is known for its seafood \u2013 especially crab, served at all-you-can-eat crab buffets across the city. It was also the birthplace of the eponymous beer in 1876, one of the four big beer companies in Japan (alongside Asahi, Kirin and Suntory). The red-brick Sapporo Beer Museum (free) is a popular spot. The best thing about Sapporo though is the weather: heavy snowfall in winter, when the city hosts Japan\u2019s largest snow festival (4-11 February 2020), then a balmy climate in summer, far from the sweltering heat further south. But Hokkaido is perhaps at its best in autumn, when the trees turn bright red and yellow. And unlike further south, where the maples often stay green until late November, the transformation generally begins in late October.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nWalk down Ganso Ramen Yokocho, a narrow, lantern-lit alleyway home to 17 traditional hole-in-the-wall ramen shops. It\u2019s Sapporo\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d ramen street, where miso ramen \u2013 Hokkaido\u2019s famed noodle dish, often topped with \u201cbutter corn\u201d \u2013 is said to have originated, spurred on by the need for a heartier broth in cold winters. The street looks almost the same as it did in the 1950s \u2013 except now there are ticket machines where you choose your order and pay. Most of the shops are tiny, seating around six people, so it\u2019s not uncommon to queue.\n\n\u2022 3 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo Ward\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japanese-style lamb barbecue Photograph: Kyoko Uchida/Alamy\n\nHokkaido is one of the few places in Japan where you\u2019ll find lamb on the menu (or see sheep in a field): the animals were introduced to Hokkaido in 1857. Now, one of the island\u2019s staple dishes is Genghis Khan (pronounced jingisukan) \u2013 grilled lamb or mutton in a sticky marinade. In Sapporo, there are plenty of Genghis Khan restaurants, but the tiny Sapporo Genghis Khan Main Branch is my favourite. It\u2019s a real locals\u2019 bar, with 18 seats crammed inside, and grills set up to cook in front of you. A 130g plate of lamb costs \u00a37.50; English menus available on request.\n\n\u2022 6 Chome Minami 5 Jonishi, Chuo Ward\n\nWhat the guide books overlook\n\nSapporo Art Park, about 15km south of the city centre, has nearly 100 acres of landscaped gardens, outdoor museums and craft studios offering workshops such as woodworking or weaving.

It\u2019s not five-star luxury, but it\u2019s rare to find accommodation as traditional as this close to the city centre. The ryokan was founded in 1903 and has been in the same family ever since. The guest rooms have tatami mats, with roll-out futons in place of western-style beds, and there\u2019s an on-site 24-hour public bathhouse. It also offers a \u201chairy crab experience\u201d, where visitors can learn how to eat this Hokkaido speciality the local way (600g crab plus instruction, \u00a341).\n\n\u2022 nakamurayaryokan.com, rooms sleeping up to four from \u00a360\n\nMoving on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shikotsu-Toya national park in autumn.

There\u2019s nearly 1,000 square kilometres to explore, dotted with steaming volcanos, caldera lakes and forest-covered mountains. Make a beeline for Lake Shikotsu, one of the deepest in Japan, ringed by three volcanoes: Eniwa, Fuppushi and Tarumae. In autumn, the trees around the lake turn a brilliant burnt orange, intensified by the lake\u2019s mirror-smooth surface. After a day of hiking, stop to soak at Marukoma Onsen (\u00a37.50 public bath, \u00a319 private) on the north shore. The open-air hot-spring baths come down almost to the lake\u2019s edge.\n\nInspiration\n\nRead: The Rurubu Omotenashi Travel Guide to Hokkaido \u2013 a chaotically colourful but compelling book detailing what to see, eat, buy and do in Hokkaido\u2019s various regions.

Photograph: Junko Takahashi/Getty Images\n\nBy Kamada Hideaki, design engineer who has worked for Toyota for 20 years\n\nMy city in a nutshell\n\nToyota is best-known as the home of the eponymous car manufacturing giant. Before it moved there, the city was called Koromo but in 1959 \u2013 as an acknowledgement of the economic prosperity the motor chain had brought to this otherwise agricultural community \u2013 it was renamed Toyota. Many visitors skip Toyota in favour of nearby Nagoya, but that is doing the city a disservice. It has art galleries, gardens, historic temples and an interesting local craft culture, not to mention scenic mountains and valleys on the doorstep.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nKorankei valley is a pretty ravine carved by the gushing Tomoe River, and a riverside footpath leads from one end of the valley to the other, past the 254-metre peak of Mount Inari. The route winds over the scarlet Taigetsukyo Bridge (a great spot for photos) and past Kojakuji Temple, part-way up the slope under a canopy of maples. There are over 4,000 maple trees in the valley, each turning like traffic lights from green to orange to red as the year progresses. It\u2019s an explosion of colour so dramatic that thousands of visitors from across Japan come each year to witness it.\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hitsumabushi \u2013 grilled eel served on white rice Photograph: Alamy\n\nUnachu is a traditional restaurant that serves the most delicious hitsumabushi \u2013 a regional speciality of grilled eel on white rice. We love eel in Japan (the Japanese consume three-quarters of the total global eel catch) and Toyota\u2019s prefecture, Aichi, is one of the main eel-producing regions in the country. The eel is grilled on skewers over charcoal and dipped in a soy-based glaze, making it crispy on the outside and delicately soft inside. It\u2019s served with a variety of bowls and condiments (\u00a326). The idea is to divide the eel into three portions: the first is to be eaten alone with rice; the second with the accompaniments (nori, spring onions and wasabi); and the third with a green tea-based dashi sauce, poured out of a teapot. The restaurant itself is very pretty, with timber frames, tatami mats and sliding shoji doors.\n\n\u2022 unachu.com, around \u00a326 a head\n\nWhere to stay\n\nToyota\u2019s accommodation is dominated by \u201cbusiness hotels\u201d, aimed at travellers who visit for work. For a place with a little more character, try Sanage Onsen Hotel Kinsenkaku in the countryside about seven miles north of the city. In Japan, traditional rooms are typically measured by the number of tatami mats they can fit (as opposed to square metres): here, all rooms consist of eight mats, suitable for up to four guests sleeping on roll-out futons. The hotel is particularly proud of its onsen: the natural water contains radon, which is said to promote healing. You can bathe in it, but also drink it to absorb the minerals \u2013 it\u2019s the first resort water in Aichi prefecture designated safe to drink by the local government.\n\n\u2022 doubles from \u00a3212 with breakfast and dinner\n\nWhat the guidebooks overlook\n\nA small mountain on the outskirts of the city called Mount Sanage. It\u2019s only 30 minutes by bus, but it\u2019s like a different world, with shaded forests, tiny mountain shrines and far-reaching views over Aichi prefecture. I love to come here to run or hike, far from the noise of the city.\n\n\n\nMoving on\n\nTake a 90-minute train and ferry trip to the tiny art island of Sakushima \u2013 one of three islands in the Aichi archipelago, with a population of just 300. In 2000, Sakushima began a regeneration project to attract visitors, displaying over 20 modern art installations in the wilderness. There\u2019s no public transport on the 1\u00bd-mile-long island, but it\u2019s easy to walk or cycle the looping roads and footpaths, following an art map from the information centre. Circling the entire island on foot will take around two hours. In places, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve walked into a Japanese video game, exploring fantastical art structures in the pretty island scenery.\n\nInspiration\n\nFollow: @88mercury, based in neighbouring city Nagoya, takes beautiful images of Aichi prefecture, with lots of pictures shot in Toyota.\n\nFixtures\n\n\n\nWales v Georgia 23 September\n\nKobe Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kobe from Mount Maya, the Ten Million Dollar Night View. Photograph: Alamy\n\nBy Ami Takemoto, contortionist and performing artist in circus and dance shows across Japan, @ami_takemoto\n\nMy city in a nutshell\n\nIn a country not known for its cultural diversity, Kobe stands out. After Yokohama, it was one of the first ports to open up to the outside world (in 1868) and it has worn its multiculturalism as a badge of honour ever since. Perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this is the number of Western-style patisserie shops \u2013 I recommend L\u2019Avenue \u2013 and the sprawling Nankinmachi, or Chinatown. But Kobe also has strong Japanese traditions: most notably the production of nihonshu, or sake as it\u2019s known in the west (sake in fact just means alcohol in Japanese). Kobe\u2019s Nada district is the top nihonshu-producing region in the country, with many breweries open for tours and samples.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nThe view from the top of Mount Maya, just north of the city, is incredible \u2013 especially at night, earning it the nickname \u201cthe $10m view\u201d. The most rewarding way to reach the peak is to hike, setting off mid-afternoon. The easy-to-follow route begins just behind Shin-Kobe station and takes around three hours. On the way up, you\u2019ll pass the Nunobiki waterfalls \u2013 their misty white water a cooling refresher on the steep slope. Finally, you\u2019ll reach the Kikuseidai observation platform, where the view unfolds. Catch the 20-minute Maya Viewline cable car back down \u2013 or up, if you don\u2019t fancy the hike (\u00a33.30 one-way).\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nKobe beef is a variety of wagyu \u2013 the highly prized beef known for its succulent, buttery texture. If you\u2019re looking to splash out, there are lots of restaurants offering tasting courses \u2013 the two-Michelin-starred Aragawa, for example, will set you back \u00a3270 a head. Wanto Burger is one place to try the city\u2019s namesake meat for a fraction of the cost. It\u2019s an American-style diner and serves a Super Wanto burger, with sliced Kobe beef steaks, in a huge bun for \u00a328.\n\n\u2022 wantoburger.com\n\nWhere to stay\n\nNegiya Ryofukaku is a ryokan in Arima, one of Japan\u2019s better-known onsen towns, around 30 minutes from Kobe. Though it doesn\u2019t have the city-centre convenience, it makes up for it with traditional Japanese charm. Rooms are quintessential Japan, with neat tatami mats, low chabudai tables and sliding paper shoji doors. You can don a traditional yukata (Japanese robe) and shuffle between the steaming open-air baths \u2013 one of which has \u201cgolden\u201d water thanks to its rich iron content \u2013 and the dining room, where an impeccably presented multi-course kaiseki-style dinner is served.

But it\u2019s a great place to spend a few days, visiting tourist-free temples, wandering the coastline and staring up at Mount Fuji whenever the clouds clear. In the surrounding countryside, the hills are covered with green tea bushes, strawberry fields and wasabi farms \u2013 the land is fertile because of the mountain spring water and cool coastal climate.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nKunozan Toshogu shrine, on the edge of the city, is an ornate complex overlooking Suruga Bay from the side of Mount Kuno. The scarlet buildings of the shrine, dedicated to the powerful Edo leader Tokugawa Ieyasu, stand under a thick tree covering, with colourful paintings, copper lanterns and gold carvings. The ascent to the shrine zigzags over 1,000 stone steps, but for those who don\u2019t want to sweat, there\u2019s the Nihondaira Ropeway (\u00a38 return), a cable car that dangles you above the forested slopes. On clear days, the views sweep across the tea fields and ocean to Mount Fuji.\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\n\n\nHug Hop, a craft beer bar five minutes\u2019 walk from Shizuoka station, serves predominantly Shizuoka-brewed beer, from makers such as Baird Beer. There is also a regularly changing menu of pub dishes, like Japanese curry and pork belly (from \u00a33).

The garden, with its waterfall-fed pond and bamboo groves, was created at the end of the Edo period (in the 18th century). The restaurant serves seasonal dishes so pretty they look like they\u2019ve been painted on the plate (eight items from \u00a345).

There are bikes to hire for a ride around Lake Kawaguchi, and plenty of boat trips. Still days see the phenomenon of sakasa Fuji, or \u201cupside-down Fuji\u201d, where the lake creates a perfect mirror image. The Mount Kachi Kachi cable car runs 400 metres up to an opposing peak for panoramic views (\u00a36 return). Fuji Q Highland (\u00a343) is Japan\u2019s premier adrenaline theme park, with some of the most spine-tingling rides on the planet, including a rollercoaster with the world\u2019s fastest acceleration and largest loop.

It\u2019s not a pretty city \u2013 more a blur of concrete tower blocks and wide-laned roads \u2013 but its proximity to some of Kyushu\u2019s wildest landscapes makes it a great base to explore the island\u2019s wider reaches and go hiking, canyoning and wild swimming. And thanks to the same geothermal activity that carved these landscapes, Oita has another very tempting reason to visit: hot springs. It\u2019s Japan\u2019s top onsen spot, with more hot-spring facilities than anywhere else in the country.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nGo to an onsen: my favourite is Hyotan, just north of the city in Beppu. There are eight different onsen under one roof, from steaming open-air baths to sunamushi, where you\u2019re buried up to your neck in hot sand. But onsen culture doesn\u2019t just mean bathing: this area also has onsen jigoku or \u201chot spring hells\u201d \u2013 places where hot sulphurous water (definitely not for swimming in) spills through cracks in the earth to create the most vibrant (and smelly) coloured lakes, from cobalt to deep red. They\u2019re also hot enough to cook with. At Jigoku Mushi Kobo Kannawa, you can order (or take your own) vegetables and meat to steam in the water, which reaches temperatures of 98C (20 minutes\u2019 use from \u00a32.50).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Slices of raw pufferfish, or fugu, part of a fugu tasting menu. Photograph: Itsuo Inouye/AP\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nUsuki Fugu Yamadaya restaurant in Oita\u2019s Miyakomachi area has a sister branch in nearby Usuki (the original store) and two in Tokyo, one of which has three Michelin stars (and, unsurprisingly, prices to match). The Usuki one is known for fugu, the pufferfish banned from consumption through the Edo period due to the number of fatalities from its ovaries and liver, which contain a poison 13 times stronger than arsenic. Even now, the Japanese emperor is forbidden by law from eating it. It\u2019s only served at restaurants with a special licence (taking around three years to earn), which verifies the chef\u2019s ability to prepare it safely. Its fugu course (from \u00a372) includes the fish in its many forms.\n\n\u2022 4-11-14, Nishiazabu, Oita\n\nWhat the guidebooks overlook\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pudding cooked using jigoku mushi\n\nA little restaurant called Okamotoya on a hill above Beppu. Outside, you can walk around the exposed sulphuric jigoku \u2013 bubbling and steaming like a giant witch\u2019s cauldron \u2013 or stop to soak in their huge onsen, with views across Beppu Bay. My favourite reason to visit is the custard puddings, cooked using jigoku mushi (\u201chell steaming\u201d) in the potent natural steam.\n\n\u2022 4 Kumi, Myoban, Beppu\n\nWhere to stay\n\nBlossom Hotel, a minute\u2019s walk from Oita\u2019s main station, has beautifully styled interiors, with warm wooden furniture and elegant sliding shoji doors. Its biggest draw is the rooftop hot spring: an infinity-edge pool 80 metres above the ground. From the water you can see the city panorama, with the mountains behind and the sea in front. It also has steam rooms, saunas and a salt spa, as well as one of the largest roof gardens in Japan, home to roughly 1,000 trees and flowers.\n\n\u2022 jrk-hotels.co.jp, doubles from \u00a366 room-only\n\nMoving on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stone-built shops in Yufuin.

Yufuin\u2019s architecture is traditional, from old stone farmhouses to elegant ryokans, but the boutique shops and trendy cafes give the town a bohemian flair. It\u2019s a great place to explore on foot, dipping into the many craft shops and studios, where you can see people practise everything from pottery to washi (Japanese paper-making). Spend an hour crafting chopsticks at Hashiya Ichizen (\u00a320), then have lunch at Izumi Soba, a traditional soba noodle shop by Lake Kinrinko on the edge of town.\n\nInspiration\n\nFollow: @foodies_oita \u2013 a great Instagram page if you\u2019re interested in finding restaurants that aren\u2019t in the guidebooks.

Photograph: Peter Elvin/Alamy\n\nBy Daiki Tanaka, professional surfer, @daikitanaka0614\n\nMy city in a nutshell\n\nFukuoka is the largest city on the southerly island of Kyushu \u2013 a five-hour Shinkansen (bullet train) ride south of Tokyo. Despite the city\u2019s size (it\u2019s home to 1.6 million people), it\u2019s very compact: if you are flying there from Tokyo, you can get from the airport to the centre in less than 15 minutes, and most of Fukuoka\u2019s key sights \u2013 such as Shofukuji, the oldest Zen shrine in Japan \u2013 are within easy walking distance.\n\nMake sure that you come with an empty stomach: Fukuoka is known for its food, from rich bowls of pork-broth hakata ramen to bright pink karashi mentaiko (pollock or cod roe in the shape of a sausage). Fukuoka Now is a website in four languages and a monthly magazine in both Japanese in English, which was founded by Canadian Nick Szasz and is packed with local news and upcoming events.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fukuoka city.

On a clear day, you get a snapshot of the real Fukuoka: Hakata Bay and the sea beyond dotted with small islands, the sandy shore, the mirror-like high-rise buildings and the hazy mountains marking the edge of the prefecture. Dusk is a great time to visit, so you catch the last of the sunset over Hakata Bay, before the city lights flick on to reveal one of Japan\u2019s most amazing nightscapes.\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nDespite Tokyo\u2019s thousands of ramen shops, Fukuoka has a good claim to be the ramen capital of Japan. My favourite ramen bar is Hakata Isso, known for its rich tonkotsu ramen, served with soft chashu (pork belly slices) and a sticky soy egg. You\u2019ll usually have to queue to get in, especially as it only seats around 10 people. As with most Japanese ramen shops, you select and pay for your food using the ticket machine on arrival (the words are written in Japanese characters, but ask which one is the standard tonkotsu ramen, \u00a35), then hand your ticket to the server. Ramen is technically fast food, so don\u2019t linger long after you\u2019ve finished eating.\n\n\u2022 3 Chome-1-6 Hakataekihigashi\n\nWhere to stay\n\nStand By Me is a \u201cstanding bar where you can also stay\u201d. In Japan, standing bars or tachinomiya \u2013 tiny bars where the only option is to stand \u2013 took off in the 1980s as an inexpensive and quick place to grab a drink, and have become popular as fun places to hang out. Stand By Me has a standing bar downstairs and a hostel upstairs, with shared and private rooms that are simple, but clean and comfortable. A \u00a37.50 ticket for the standing bar lets you pick any four things off the menu, including beer, sake and lots of delicious local food: it\u2019s a good \u201csightseeing sampler\u201d if you\u2019re new to Japanese cuisine and aren\u2019t sure where to eat. The bar is also a great space to meet other like-minded travellers.\n\n\u2022 dorm beds from \u00a334, private rooms from \u00a3102\n\nWhat the guidebooks overlook\n\nPalm Beach The Gardens: even a lot of Fukuoka locals don\u2019t know about this place. It\u2019s a small dining and shopping complex on a golden beach, about 30km from the city centre. There are surfer-style cafes and bars serving Hawaiian favourites such as loco moco and garlic shrimp, as well as Italian gelatarias and cool surf shops. It\u2019s one of my favourite places in Japan to watch the sunset, especially after a day of surfing.\n\n\u2022 285 Nishi-ku Nishiura, Fukuoka-shi, Fukuoka\n\nMoving on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stalls selling local snacks and sweet near Dazaifu\u2019s Tenmangu Shrine.

This seventh-century settlement was Kyushu\u2019s administration centre for more than 500 years, from the year 663. The main tourist sight is Tenmangu Shrine, which was built in 903 on the grave of the scholar and politician Sugawara Michizane.

Photograph: Sean Pavone/Getty Images\n\nBy Noriyuki Yamashita, shochu enthusiast and owner of Glocal Bar Vibes, @glocal_bar_vibes\n\nMy city in a nutshell\n\nKumamoto city is built around the 17th-century Kumamoto Castle \u2013 considered one of the \u201ctop three castles\u201d of Japan. In 1877, it successfully withstood a 20,000-strong samurai attack for nearly two months. In 2016, it faced another attack: a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. Although parts of the building were damaged, it stills stands on its grassy mount as a symbol of Kumamoto\u2019s resilience. To the west lie the islands of Amakusa, and to the east, the volcanic mountains of Aso, making Kumamoto a great base for exploring Kyushu island\u2019s wild side. But don\u2019t rush to leave the city too quickly: after dark, the side streets around Shimotori and Kamitori (Kumamoto\u2019s two main strips) come to life, packed with hundreds of tiny izakayas (bars) that deserve at least a few nights of your attention.\n\nIf you do one thing\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Suizenji Jojuen Garden. Photograph: Alamy\n\n\n\nSuizenji Jojuen is a 17th-century garden considered one of the most beautiful in Japan, full of arched stone bridges, plum trees and herons standing stoically at the water\u2019s edge. It was designed in the kaiyu-shiki-teien style, leading visitors clockwise around a pond. The various elements of the garden are meant to reflect the 53 stops or post stations of the Tokaido \u2013 a road that connected Tokyo (then named Edo) with Kyoto. You\u2019ll head across a replica of Tokyo\u2019s Nihonbashi Bridge, pass a miniature Mount Fuji and finish at the Kokin Denju No Ma teahouse, transported to Suizenji in 1912 from Kyoto\u2019s Imperial Palace. Stop for tea on the tatami mats (\u00a34, including a sweet treat), watching the koi carp and turtles swim in the pond.\n\nMy favourite place to eat\n\nHero Umi izakaya specialises in seafood, getting its catch fresh each day from the Amakusa islands \u2013 the archipelago is just an hour away and is known for its high-quality hauls. At lunchtime, the fisherman\u2019s bowl (ryoshi no makanai donburi, \u00a37.50) is an assortment of sashimi caught that morning, served with rice and soup. In the evening, large sashimi platters come paired with a 120-minute nomihodai (all-you-can-drink) menu (from \u00a330, call ahead to book). Don\u2019t leave without ordering a side of basashi (raw horse meat) \u2013 a popular Kumamoto delicacy.\n\n\u2022 hero-umi.com\n\nWhere to stay\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hot spring baths at Maruko Hotel\n\nMaruko Hotel, a 120-year-old establishment just off the Kamitori, has the charm of an old-style ryokan but with the convenience of a sleek city centre hotel. You\u2019ll find tatami rooms with roll-out futons, as well as western-style bedrooms. There are male and female hot-springs baths, a private bath you can reserve for your group, and a tiny outside tub so you can soak in the open air. Dinner is served in traditional ryokan style, with lots of colourful small plates of pickles, fish, tofu and endless bowls of rice.\n\n\u2022 doubles from \u00a3170 room only, set meals from \u00a315\n\nWhat the guidebooks overlook\n\nMy own shochu bar, Glocal Bar Vibes (a \u201clocal\u201d bar for \u201cglobal\u201d people). As the bar owner I\u2019m biased, but you can seriously feel Kumamoto. We sell over 120 different kinds of shochu \u2013 a distilled spirit made from barley, potato or rice. It\u2019s the most popular alcoholic drink in southern Japan (not sake/nihonshu, as most people think). On Tuesdays we do an all-English night \u2013 no Japanese speaking allowed. It\u2019s a great chance to drink with the locals.\n\n\u2022 Arita BLD 3F, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku\n\nMoving on\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Getty Images\n\nHead to the southern city of Hitoyoshi \u2013 a 90-minute drive through 24 tunnels, or a 150-minute steam train along the Kuma River (\u00a320 one-way). Even for Japanese tourists, this is about as inaka (rural) as it gets. The city is sometimes called Little Kyoto because of its red-lacquered shrine gates, Edo-style teahouses and hot-spring baths. But there\u2019s also another reason to visit: shochu, the distinctively Japanese liquor made since the 16th century. There are 28 distilleries in the Hitoyoshi-Kuma valley, and the \u201cKuma shochu\u201d name has World Trade Organisation protection. Distillery tours always end with a generous shochu tasting, so you may want to stay the night: I recommend Nabeya Honkan, beside the rushing Kuma River.\n\nInspiration\n\nFollow: @kumalikecom on instagram (or visit their website: kumalike.com) for tips on the best restaurants, bars and attractions, as decided by the locals.\n\nRead: asianwanderlust.com/en/kumamoto-japan/ \u2013 a great blog giving you and in-depth account of the top things to do and places to stay in Kumamoto\n\nFixtures\n\nWales vs Uruguay 13 October\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
