But they stand a chance to do what only one of those 14 straight division championship teams could do: That's win a World Series.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s 6-0 victory against the San Francisco Giants, the Braves took the first big step toward achieving their ultimate goal by clinching the National League East title for the second straight season.\n\nThe Braves had already clinched a postseason berth. Now they join the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees as division clinchers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs it has been throughout most of the season, the clinching victory was the Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. show. The 21-year-old outfielder reached base three times, including hitting his team-leading 41st home run. Acu\u00f1a is three stolen bases away from becoming the youngest member of MLB\u2019s 40-40 club.\n\nOn the hill, Mike Foltynewicz pitched eight scoreless innings. The Braves have been winners in each of his last 12 starts.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have clinched their second straight National League East championship.

But it's a conversation they've earned the right to be in.\n\nAll season long the Braves have been consistent and balanced. The numbers bear that out as they enter the stretch run with a top 10 offense and a top 10 pitching staff. The Braves posted a winning record in every month but March, when they started 0-3. They also lead the NL in road wins and wins against teams over .500.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Braves lineup is loaded with firepower. Freddie Freeman is the stalwart. Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. brings the thrills. Ozzie Albies is a superstar in the making. While Josh Donaldson has regained his MVP form from four years ago. They\u2019ve all been exceptional and are capable of dominating a series.\n\nThe rotation is solid with Dallas Keuchel, Mike Soroka and Mike Foltynewicz pitching well. Their longtime ace, Julio Teheran, has struggled of late. That\u2019s had some questioning his postseason roster spot. Nonetheless, most playoff teams would love having a No. 4 who\u2019s had the success Teheran has had over this career. And Max Fried is a solid No. 5 as well.\n\nWhat the Braves have to do to win the World Series\n\nFirst and foremost, they have to win a playoff series. That might sound obvious or harsh depending on your viewpoint. But it\u2019s also a fact that Atlanta hasn\u2019t won a playoff series since 2001. That\u2019s despite making five postseason appearances since then.\n\nNo offense to the wild-card contenders, but if the Braves do advance, their journey to the World Series will likely have to go through Los Angeles. The Braves were 2-4 against the Dodgers this season, but were outscored in those meetings 37-19. That suggests the lower scoring the games are, the better chance Atlanta would have to get past L.A.\n\nThat said, the Braves have a lineup that\u2019s capable of carrying them. If the offense clicks in October, they will be a difficult team to eliminate.\n\nLingering questions\n\nFreddie Freeman recently admitted he\u2019s dealing with a bone spur in his right elbow. He\u2019s been able to play through it and continue producing at an elite level, but acknowledged there are some days when it\u2019s more sore than others. The Braves had to hope the discomfort remains at a manageable level.\n\nShane Greene got off to a rough start in Atlanta, but he\u2019s back looking like one of the best closers in MLB. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is Atlanta\u2019s bullpen will have to get big outs from other guys. Manager Brian Snitker\u2019s task will be figuring out which of those guys gives him the best chance to get those key outs.\n\nBraves lefties Sean Newcomb, Jerry Blevins and A.J. Minter all have good arms, but have all also struggled. With matchups against Cody Bellinger. Max Muncy and Joc Pederson potentially on the horizon, that situation is a valid concern.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Atlanta Braves have clinched their second straight National League East championship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/q69G_wNLAb8zLYE6gppqag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J9od9KYEWKysGjf69iZErw--~B/aD0yMDEyO3c9MzAxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/adbfd670-dbf2-11e9-b56b-3512520696d9", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
