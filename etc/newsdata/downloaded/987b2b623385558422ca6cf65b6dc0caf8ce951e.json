His resurrection of T\u2019Challa for Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was a runaway bestseller that, in turn, influenced Ryan Coogler\u2019s blockbuster \u201cBlack Panther\u201d movie.\n\nNow, Coates has unveiled yet another creative direction by publishing a novel called \u201cThe Water Dancer.\u201d While neither polemical nor wholly fantastical, the story draws on skills he developed in those other genres. Presented as a slave narrative in the tradition of Frederick Douglass, \u201cThe Water Dancer\u201d is rooted in details of pre-Civil War Virginia. But like Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cUnderground Railroad,\u201d the story\u2019s bracing realism is periodically overcome by the mist of fantasy. The result is a budding superhero discovering the dimensions of his power within the confines of a historical novel that critiques the function of racial oppression.\n\nThat sounds like a mess \u2014 Spider-Man Takes Antietam! \u2014 but Coates isn\u2019t dropping supernatural garnish onto \u201cThe Water Dancer\u201d anymore than Toni Morrison sends a ghost whooshing through \u201cBeloved\u201d for cheap thrills. Instead, Coates\u2019s fantastical elements are deeply integral to his novel, a way of representing something larger and more profound than the confines of realism could contain. This week, Oprah picked \u201cThe Water Dancer\u201d for her new book club, which will stream on Apple TV+ when it launches Nov. 1.\n\nThe story opens with calamity: During a terrible storm on the Lockless plantation, a horse-drawn carriage crashes off a bridge into an icy river. The driver, a slave named Hiram, miraculously survives. But the passenger, Hiram\u2019s white half-brother and the heir apparent of the plantation, drowns. For their father, this is just the latest disaster. Poorly managed tobacco farming has destroyed the soil on the Lockless plantation. Every year, more slaves must be sold down South to service rising debts. To the master, this is a troubling inconvenience. To the enslaved families ripped apart, it\u2019s a death sentence.\n\nHiram narrates this story from a distance of many years, but he describes everything with bracing immediacy. After the drowning death of his half-brother, he jumps back to describe the traumatic loss of his black mother and his existence as the favored slave of his proud father/master. That precarious position introduces Hiram to the social and psychological contortions of America\u2019s \u201cpeculiar institution,\u201d and he becomes an insightful critic of the layers of white deception. The Quality people, as Hiram refers to them, \u201ctransfigure robbery into charity,\u201d rape into romance, slavery into family. The stability of this system, he learns, depends not merely on power and terror but on a carefully engineered structure of lies and pretenses.\n\n\u201cI saw that just as the fields and its workers were the engine of everything, the house itself would have been lost without those who tasked within,\u201d Hiram writes. \u201cMy father, like all the masters, built an entire apparatus to disguise this weakness, to hide how prostrate they truly were.\u201d The grand house is constructed \u201cso as to make it appear powered by imperceptible energy.\u201d Every care is taken to render invisible not just the horrors of slavery but its victims, who are kept \u201cin the down there, in a basement of the mind.\u201d Moving between floors, Hiram and his fellow prisoners must use the secret \u201cslave-stairs\u201d so that they are never seen. During parties, Hiram says, \u201cwe were made to appear in such appealing dress and grooming so that one could imagine that we were not slaves at all but mystical ornaments, a portion of the manor\u2019s charms.\u201d\n\nDespite his extraordinary skill as a modern-day social critic, Coates never intrudes on the stately, slightly antique voice of his narrator. But his understanding of modern-day racism illuminates this portrayal of the 19th century, and it\u2019s not difficult to hear the contemporary echoes of Hiram\u2019s observations. After all, we still live in a world carefully designed to dissolve the contributions of black Americans in the solvent of white superiority. Our national mythology still regards slavery as a tragic footnote, not the essential precondition for America\u2019s rise to power. As Coates writes in \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d ignoring the prominence of slavery remains essential, because it leaves \u201cwhite Americans free to trumpet their love of freedom and democratic values.\u201d Such historical amnesia is the fuel that keeps our national innocence burning bright.\n\nIn response to that time-honored delusion, Coates has cleverly constructed \u201cThe Water Dancer\u201d so that the act of remembering is key to Hiram\u2019s supernatural ability. For several years, the young slave doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to him or have any control over the phenomenon, but gradually he comes to realize that by recalling neglected experiences and people, he can fold physical space like fabric and thereby travel instantly to distant points. Naturally, that\u2019s a skill of great interest to agents working for the Underground Railroad.\n\nAmong the many fascinating elements of this perilous journey is Hiram\u2019s interaction with these daring abolitionists on both sides of the slavery border. Harriet Tubman appears clad in the superhero guise she deserves. But Hiram must negotiate his standing with white agents, too \u2014 condescending liberals who believe they know what\u2019s best for their enslaved brethren.\n\nThe tone and setting couldn\u2019t be more different from his \u201cBlack Panther\u201d comics, but with Hiram, Coates manages to re-create, in the context of the antebellum South, a chosen one who comes to understand the horrible burden of what\u2019s required of him. That archetypal hero feels strangely natural here because Coates has effectively taken back this tarnished history and clarified the position of blacks in the fight against slavery. They are not passive victims waiting to be saved by enlightened whites. They are warriors, strategists and spies plotting their escape and struggling to remember everything.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday, Ta-Nehisi Coates will be at the Lincoln Theatre, 1215 U St. NW. 202-888-0050. thelincolndc.com.\n\nThe Water Dancer\n\nBy Ta-Nehisi Coates\n\nOne World. 416 pp. $28", "description": "The National Book Award winner\u2019s debut novel is Oprah\u2019s latest book club pick.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D3KDEEW2IQI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
