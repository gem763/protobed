Vacuum cleaners with special filters, called Hepa filters, can also be used, experts said.\n\n\u201cIf I could tell parents one thing, it\u2019s that they should leave shoes at the door, keep the house really clean of dust and make sure everyone washes up before they eat,\u201d said Jessica Wolpaw Reyes, a professor of economics at Amherst, in Massachusetts, who has done extensive studies on lead.\n\nAnd everyone said that the government needed to clean up the city and its schools as soon as possible.", "description": "Every expert consulted by The New York Times said it was still safe to visit Paris, though they differed on what precautions should be taken.", "authors": ["James Glanz", "Elian Peltier"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/world/15notre-dame-lead-takeaways1/15notre-dame-lead-takeaways1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
