He\u2019s the U.S. government\u2019s first witness in the trial of Jean Boustani, a Privinvest Group salesman who\u2019s accused of defrauding U.S. investors.\n\nPearse testified Thursday that while sitting by a pool at a hotel in Maputo, Mozambique, in 2013, Boustani offered him a bribe in exchange for lower transaction fees Credit Suisse would charge on a loan.\n\n\u201cI remember it clearly because it was the first time in my life I\u2019d been offered a kickback,\u201d Pearse told the jury in Brooklyn.\n\nPearse said he was trying to leave Credit Suisse and offered not only to cut some of the fees his bankers collected in the deal, but asked for Boustani\u2019s help in setting up a new company with Privinvest\u2019s chief executive officer Iskandar Safa.\n\nThose decisions were spurred by his affair with Detelina Subeva, a Credit Suisse banker who was junior to him, Pearse said. She has also pleaded guilty and will testify as a prosecution witness against Boustani.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Mark Bini asked Pearse if his affair with Subeva played any role in his decision to quit in 2013. He replied he was trying to hide the \u201cvery deep romantic relationship\u201d from his superiors.\n\n\u201cWe were both married at the time and it was difficult to see each other unless we were traveling,\u201d Pearse said. \u201cI wanted that relationship to continue. I wanted to leave Credit Suisse. I wanted to establish a deeper relationship with Ms. Subeva.\u201d\n\nBoustani is accused by prosecutors of masterminding \u201ca brazen international criminal scheme\u201d that helped one of the world\u2019s poorest countries borrow billions of dollars for dubious maritime projects, including one to ward off pirates.\n\nProsecutors say Privinvest officials charged Mozambique inflated prices for equipment and services, freeing up money for bribes. Mozambican government officials, corporate executives and investment bankers stole about $200 million, according to the U.S.\n\nStephen Hauss, a lawyer for Privinvest, says the company denies all wrongdoing. \u201cObviously Pearse has a sweetheart deal from the government to say what the government wants him to,\u201d he said.\n\nJurors saw records showing Privinvest made regular $1 million deposits into Pearse\u2019s bank account in Abu Dhabi. Pearse testified he shared at least $2 million of the payments he got from Boustani with Subeva.\n\nRead more on ProIndicus loan here\n\nAmong the companies that got loans from Credit Suisse was ProIndicus SA, which was to perform coastal surveillance. Pearse told the jury that after a loan to state-owned ProIndicus closed in March 2013, he met with Safa and Boustani at the Privinvest CEO\u2019s estate on the French Riviera where Pearse secured a cut of any future loans.\n\n\u201cIt was there that the terms of my kickback were agreed upon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was agreed I\u2019d be paid a fee for any further Privinvest business with Credit Suisse.\u201d\n\nThe Mozambique loans were arranged by Credit Suisse and the Russian bank, VTB Group. The money was supposed to be used for tuna-fishing operations, shipyards and the coastal security system. But those projects never happened, prosecutors said.\n\nMozambique sued Safa, a Lebanese-French billionaire, for fraud in August in London. A spokesman for Safa said at the time that the entrepreneur denies any wrongdoing and that the English courts have no jurisdiction over him.\n\nIn addition, Ndambi Guebuza, son of Mozambique\u2019s former president Armando Guebuza, was arrested in February in connection with the loan scandal. He\u2019s fighting the charges.\n\nPearse testified late Wednesday that Boustani told him Privinvest also paid a $2 million bribe to Makram Abboud, a senior banker at VTB, who worked on Mozambican loans.\n\nVTB denied Pearse\u2019s claims in a statement, calling him \u201ca convicted fraudster\u201d and said none of its bankers have been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cWe have seen no evidence that Mr. Abboud or any other VTB employee received improper payments of any kind in connection with those projects,\u201d the bank said in a statement Thursday.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A former Credit Suisse Group AG banker told a federal jury in New York that his decision to take millions of dollars in bribes was fueled in part by his secret love affair with a subordinate.Andrew Pearse, 49, admitted he got at least $45 million for his role in arranging $2 billion in", "authors": ["Patricia Hurtado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/236MFFdP6DrQ6GW1bqBj5A--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/c99ed4a0f46ab4e1002258fb1bcb9f8c", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
