However, that figure could be closer to 200.\n\nThe source had knowledge of the deaths, as he had worked at the camp from June to December 2018, but could not provide further information about any deaths that may have occurred at the camp before or after he left. The reports appear to corroborate similar claims put out by Kuchar County Police Chief Himit Qari, who was arrested after expressing his concerns over abuses taking place in the camps while attending a party at a friend\u2019s house this year.\n\nWhile attending the gathering, Qari confessed that \u201cmany people had died\u201d at the same concentration camp where he helped oversee the mass internment program that began in mid-2017. Weeks after his admission, Qari was summoned by the Kuchar County Public Security Bureau\u2019s disciplinary office for further investigation, before being sent to prison on charges of \u201crevealing state secrets\u201d and criminal trial.\n\nSince 2017, Chinese communist officials in Beijing have ordered the imprisonment of approximately 1.5 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities across Xinjiang. The aim is to indoctrinate them into the ideals of Chinese nationalism and communist ideology, forcing them to disavow their allegiance to Islam, engaging in slave labor, receiving forced sterilization or birth control, and, according to some reports, being used as live organ donors.\n\nThere have also been reports of killings in Xinjiang\u2019s internment camps. RFA also reported that a man Chinese authorities claimed had suffered a fatal heart attack while imprisoned in a detention center was actually beaten to death by a drunken police officer.\n\nThe RFA report released this week, despite using evidence from 2018, before the acceleration of internment of Muslims, marks the largest known number of detention-related deaths at any single internment camp since their inception two years ago. Given the dramatic increase in estimated prisoners at each facility and their rapid construction, the total death toll is likely significantly higher.\n\nBeijing has aggressively denied widespread accusations that they are being used as a repressive apparatus, insisting they are instead \u201cvoluntary de-radicalization camps\u201d and \u201cvocational training centers\u201d to help ethnic minorities integrate into Chinese society. They also claim the camps are a necessary measure to prevent terrorism following various Islamist inspired attacks over the past decades.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "At least 150 Uyghur Muslims died over the course of six months while imprisoned at one of China's concentration camps.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1148084972-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
