Companies may provide list prices, but they also negotiate discounts and after-market rebates with purchasers and their representatives - such as pharmacy benefit managers, health insurers and employers, as well as government and state health coverage programmes.\n\nDrugmakers have been under increasing political scrutiny to lower costs to consumers and have responded by limiting annual list price hikes to under 10 percent in many cases.\n\nICER evaluated the drug pricing in partnership with the research firm SSR Health, which calculated the cost increases excluding discounts and after-market rebates.\n\n'New important benefit'\n\nAbbVie spokesperson Adelle Infante said that ICER's data on its net pricing is inaccurate and called into question the group's methodology.\n\nRoche spokesperson Emmy Wang said that in pricing drugs, the company strives for the right balance between patient access and investing for breakthroughs in medicine.\n\nGilead, Biogen, Pfizer and Eli Lilly also questioned ICER's analysis, methodology and conclusions, with Lilly spokesperson Mark Taylor noting that generic versions of Cialis were now available for up to 90 percent less than the retail price.\n\nAmgen did not have an immediate comment.\n\nICER acknowledged it was difficult to determine the actual increase in spending on the drugs, but said it was confident that the seven drugs currently cost a lot more than they did just a few years ago.\n\nPricing drugs based on new benefits could help slow cost hikes, ICER Chief Medical Officer David Rind said.\n\n\"If manufacturers weren't raising prices [when] they haven't shown a new important benefit, I think that would help,\" he said.\n\nCelgene's multiple myeloma drug Revlimid and Gilead's HIV treatment Genvoya were also large contributors to spending but were excluded from the list because of their clinical advancements, ICER said.\n\nHumira's net price increase over 2017 and 2018 added $1.8bn in spending, while Rituxan added $806m, the report said.", "description": "Report says Humira and Rituxan topped list of drugs with highest spike in cost, despite doubt about research methods.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/7f1457ab2e924337b5a2ad7a31f7fe95_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
