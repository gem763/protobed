She said that a vulnerability in this chipset would have allowed an attacker to download and install new firmware, and then reboot the feeders so the changes take hold.\n\nProsvetova said the vulnerabilities would have been ideal for hackers looking into hijacking the pet feeders into an IoT DDoS botnet, as the entire process could be easily automated and carried out at scale.\n\nXiaomi was notified last week\n\nThe researcher contacted Xiaomi via email last week and notified the Chinese vendor of the security flaws she discovered. In a follow-up message posted on her Telegram channel, she posted a screenshot of the vendor's reply, which acknowleding the bugs and promised a fix.\n\nA Xiaomi spokesperson did not return an email seeking details about the patches.\n\nIt is unclear if a fix has been deployed, but Prosvetova has refrained from posting exact details about the bugs she found, giving more time to the vendor to fix the issue. The Xiaomi rep also told the researcher she won't be eligible for a bug bounty because the company doesn't run a vulnerability rewards program (VRP), like most big tech companies do.", "description": "Russian security researcher finds API and firmware bugs impacting around 10,950 Xiaomi FurryTail pet feeders.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/1133b532-ee5a-4c58-a08b-14981deec59e/thumbnail/770x578/1c7757348fd82b14695057112d73f8b7/xiaomi-furrytail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
