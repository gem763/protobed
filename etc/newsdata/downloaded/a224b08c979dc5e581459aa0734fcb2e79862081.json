All it took to get round the problem of a hard border in Ireland was to have two hard borders instead. But these will be simple, as they\u2019ll be at unspecified places, so maybe they can change every week so everyone gets a go at being a border which is fairer.\n\nSo one might be in Cork, and the other in a branch of Nandos in Eastbourne, where you can get half-price Peri-Peri chicken while you\u2019re having your lorry investigated by customs officers. Or it could be in Qatar, as they seem to host most things they\u2019re clearly not equipped for.\n\nThe difficulty of how to avoid checking goods as they cross the border has also been solved, by declaring it will be done by \u201cnew technology\u201d, without getting bogged down in what that technology is.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow we can enjoy the thrill of wondering what they\u2019ll reveal. It might be a giant mechanical parrot that flies across Europe identifying goods heading for the Irish border, squawking \u201cthat needs VAT paying on that, truckload of onions, truckload of onions\u201d.\n\nTo simplify matters even more, this agreement will be ratified by a Northern Ireland Assembly that hasn\u2019t existed for three years, so they might as well tell the EU the scheme will be voted on every Tuesday by the Knights of the Round Table. That might work more smoothly \u2013 until it breaks down because Lancelot went up the wall about petrol duty \u2013 but it would fit in with their aim of being \u201ccreative\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

When it\u2019s asked how it could legally take us out of the EU without an agreement, when that would be illegal, it says, \u201cAh, we have a plan.\u201d Several ministers have elaborated on this policy, by adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not saying what it is yet\u201d.\n\nThis is lovable, like when a six-year-old tells you they\u2019re building a rocket out of pencil shavings and ear wax, so you ask how it will fly and they tell you \u201cI\u2019m not saying yet\u201d. So Michel Barnier\u2019s reply to the proposals should be \u201cah, have you got a plan, that\u2019s sweet. Well then Boris, write it out neatly and I promise I\u2019ll read it as soon as I\u2019ve finished making dinner.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery how the Irish aspect of leaving the EU has become complicated, because the border between Ireland and Britain has never been an issue before. For example, David Davis was asked at the time of the referendum how we would deal with problems it could create in Ireland, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re Britain, we know how to sort out Ireland.\u201d\n\nThis seems obvious, as the largest party amongst nationalists in Northern Ireland is Sinn Fein, and while I don\u2019t speak Gaelic, I expect Sinn Fein translates as \u201cfair enough Britain, whatever you say is alright with us mate\u201d.\n\nIf you were cynical, you might feel there\u2019s no expectation these proposals will be accepted, but when they\u2019re rejected by the EU, the government can say, \u201cThere you are, you see. We spent almost 10 minutes working out a compromise, carefully written on the back of a leaflet that came from Sky about their winter films package, and the stubborn EU STILL won\u2019t agree.\u201d\n\nTo make this endearing, Boris Johnson acts as if his peculiar suggestions are a great historical pronouncement, like the American Declaration of Human Rights, and there will be paintings of them all signing it with a quill while he doodles a picture of a racing car over clause 7b.\n\nOne aspect of our new relationship with Europe that seems especially heartfelt is the insistence we end \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d. Priti Patel was particularly emotional about this, winning a huge roar of approval at the Conservative conference for shouting they will \u201cend freedom of movement once and for all\u201d.\n\nOther people round the world consider it some sort of advantage to be free to move where they fancy, but Conservatives are tougher than that, and scream with delight, \u201cYES, at LAST, we\u2019re all going to be stopped from going where we want.\u201d\n\nTo become even more popular with her members, Priti Patel should now promise to kidnap them all and put their head in a sack and drive them on a back of a truck to an unknown destination and drag them to a basement and secure them to a length of iron pipe screwed into the wall.\n\nBecause we\u2019re in new exciting times when Conservatives tell us we have to leave Europe to \u201cprevent riots\u201d. What a thrilling development that the Conservative Party now sees riots as a healthy tool for influencing government policy. Maybe Jeremy Hunt and Esther McVey will reveal they threw petrol bombs in Tottenham in the 1980s to demand British Rail was sold off to private investors.\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote campaign needs to take notice of this. Instead of marching and putting pictures on Instagram of them knitting EU flags, they should announce they want a second referendum by Wednesday or they\u2019re smashing the windows at PC World and walking off with a 78-inch TV.\n\nBecause this acid trip we\u2019re on is the new normal, in which we\u2019re led by someone who explains his thinking in interviews with answers such as \u201cah, ah, yes, this is very much, if I may, we had 17, er 17, the biggest democratic vote in ipso facto, 17.4 million in, in all human, or indeed animal, history.\u201d And he\u2019s known for his great skills as a communicator.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t blame the EU if their response to these proposals was a prescription for heavy medication, and a request to come back in a few years\u2019 time when we\u2019ve got better.", "description": "In the end, sorting out the backstop was easy.
