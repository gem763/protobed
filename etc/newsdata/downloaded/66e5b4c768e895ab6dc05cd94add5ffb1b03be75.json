Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the House Oversight Committee said. \"There is a series of folders which all come from Trump hotels, so folder after folder that says Trump hotel.

Volker resigned from his post last week and was scheduled to meet with congressional investigators on Thursday.\n\nIn a deluge of press interviews over the past week, Giuliani has said he was merely doing the State Department's bidding in reaching out to Ukrainians.\n\n\"I never talked to a Ukrainian official until the State Department called and asked me to do it,\" Giuliani said on Fox News last week, \"and then I reported every conversation back to them.\"\n\nIn an interview Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" with George Stephanopoulos, Giuliani insisted that \"the Ukrainians came to me.
