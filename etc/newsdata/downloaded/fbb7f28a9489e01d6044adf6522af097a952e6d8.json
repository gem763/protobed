So many celebrities throw them, including Made in Chelsea's Binky Felstead who orchestrated a mass of pink confetti to fall down from the ceiling to announce she was having a girl. Kevin Jonas had his two-year-old daughter hold a pink 'baby girl' balloon to confirm his second baby was also a girl. You just have to search 'gender reveal party' on Pinterest to find hundreds of pins of ideas on how to throw the 'perfect' party. Results are a sea of blue and pink decorations, cakes, and one woman even made a half-pink-half-blue dress for the occasion.\n\nThese parties, on first glance, may seem like a cutesy, harmless way of celebrating bringing new life into the world. But for many reasons (mainly that they rely on patriarchal gender stereotypes) the gender reveal party isn't as innocent as you might think. And the woman whose own gender reveal party sparked the trend has said she regrets it in a new interview with The Guardian.\n\nJenna Karvunidis baked a cake with pink icing back in 2008 to announce to her family she was having a baby girl. She wrote about the party on her blog, which was then picked up by a pregnancy magazine, and the trend was born. Some people took their parties to the extreme: including Dennis Dickey whose gender reveal announcement (which involved him shooting at a target loaded with a homemade explosive packed with blue powder) started a fire that destroyed a LOT of Arizona forest, and cost more than $8million to extinguish.\n\nJenna had previously explained how she inadvertently started the trend. \u201cI had had several miscarriages. It was like, \u2018Oh yay, I\u2019m finally at a point in my pregnancy where I know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl\u2019 rather than \u2018Let\u2019s saddle this kid with a whole identity\u2019. I don\u2019t think anybody was thinking like that in 2008,\u201d she told the newspaper in July this year. \u201cThen I started to realise that non-binary people and trans people were feeling affected by this, and I started to feel bad that I had released something bad into the world,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, in a new interview, she says she's not only worried the trend she helped to make so popular actively harms trans and non-binary people. But that gender reveal parties help people reduce sex and gender down to two options: pink or blue, boy or girl. And that this automatically imposes an identity and set of expectations on that unborn human. \"It\u2019s not a football player or a ballet dancer, it\u2019s a foetus, but the gender reveal helps people forget that,\u201d she said.\n\ncis folks make gender reveal explosives in their garages, ask invasive questions about people's genitals, and awkwardly stare at everything they don't like\n\n\n\nbut WE'RE the ones making THEM uncomfortable... alright\n\n\n\n\u2014 T\ud83c\udf83ni (@ToniQueene) October 15, 2019\n\nLet\u2019s tone down the gender reveal parties pic.twitter.com/ohIGiFq81d \u2014 Denlesks (@Denlesks) October 12, 2019\n\nWhen her younger daughter threw a tantrum because she didn't want to play with Lego because she considered it a \"boy's toy\", Jenna realised the whole pink and blue thing is far too reductive. She said she's also learning from her eldest daughter, Bianca, now 10, who she threw the party for that sparked the trend.\n\n\u201cBianca tells me there are more than two genders and many sexualities. I hadn\u2019t considered all this before. At least when the child is born you are getting all the information at once: the sex, the colour of their hair, who they look like, how long they are, what their heart rate is. With the gender-reveal you\u2019ve isolated one aspect of this person. When it gets elevated as being central to your identity that\u2019s problematic.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: vsanderson More", "description": "Jenna Karvunidis baked a cake with pink icing back in 2008, little did she know it would spark a huge trend...", "authors": ["Paisley Gilmour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yoOPL8wZgxiUknJwBbNGxQ--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/f2bcaf8d314df78a62da12c77a79b9a5", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
