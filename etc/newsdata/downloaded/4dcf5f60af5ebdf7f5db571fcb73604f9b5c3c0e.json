We will do what we have to do, if we have to grind it out, no matter how we do it, win with a drop-goal or something, we will do it to get out of the pool stages.\u201d\n\nThe Boks have chosen a six-two split on the bench, overloading with forwards \u2013 hooker Marx, props Kitshoff and Vincent Koch, locks RG Snyman and Franco Mostert, and loose-forward Francois Louw, another sign that Erasmus is concerned about the battle in the pack.\n\nIt means the only backline cover comes from utility back Frans Steyn and scrum-half Herschel Jantjies, but Erasmus feels they have enough versatility on the pitch to cover for any eventualities.\n\n\u201cPeople may think it is a gamble to have only two back replacements, but we want to have plenty of ammunition for what is likely to be a major forward battle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 23-player game these days and the players who come on will be expected to contribute almost as much in game time as those who start among the front rowers.\n\n\u201cFrans can cover (number) 10, 12 and 15, Damian de Allende can play at 13, Cheslin (Kolbe) can play scrumhalf or full-back and Faf (De Klerk) can even play as a flyhalf if needed. So we have a lot of options.\u201d\n\nCentre Jesse Kriel has not been considered as he recovers from a hamstring injury picked up in the opening 23-13 loss to New Zealand.\n\nTeam: 15-Willie le Roux, 14-Cheslin Kolbe, 13-Lukhanyo Am,\n\n12-Damian de Allende, 11-Makazole Mapimpi, 10-Handre Pollard,\n\n9-Faf de Klerk, 8-Duane Vermeulen, 7-Pieter-Steph du Toit,\n\n6-Siya Kolisi (captain), 5-Lood de Jager, 4-Eben Etzebeth, 3-Frans Malherbe, 2-Bongi Mbonambi, 1-Tendai Mtawarira\n\nReplacements: 16-Malcolm Marx, 17-Steven Kitshoff,\n\n18-Vincent Koch, 19-RG Snyman, 20-Franco Mostert, 21-Francois Louw, 22-Herchel Jantjies, 23-Frans Steyn.", "description": "South Africa have made three changes to their first-choice pack as they brace for a muscular forward challenge from Italy in the crunch Rugby World Cup Pool B clash at the Shizuoka Stadium on Friday.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435808825&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9028T-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
