She said while she and her son were out for Halloween last year, people waited for him to say \"trick or treat\" before giving him candy.\n\n\"Please allow him (or anyone with with a BLUE BUCKET) to enjoy this day,\" Taylor wrote.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 148,000 times as of Sunday.\n\nKristyn Roth, chief marketing officer for the Autism Society of America, said in a statement, the idea to use blue buckets \"is one example of creating an adaptive, enjoyable experience\" for a child with autism.\n\n\"While blue Halloween buckets are not a standardized practice, we have seen individuals with autism and families create various messaging to indicate that someone is autistic and may communicate differently,\" Roth said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.\n\nIn 2016, The Autism Society of America released tips for parents with children with autism who are looking to enjoy Halloween.\n\n\"Halloween can be a wonderful and exciting event, but the lack of routine and hidden faces may be among the stressors that make Halloween less fun for our loved ones on the autism spectrum,\" the organization wrote in 2016.\n\nTeal pumpkins: Why put out a teal pumpkin and non-food treats? Moms with kids who depend on them explain\n\nThe organization recommended making sure a Halloween plan is in place. If going out for Halloween isn't an option, The Autism Society of America also recommended throwing a Halloween party at home.\n\n\"Consider throwing a Halloween party at your house, then you and your child can work together to plan decorations, food, and guests; nothing is a surprise and you still get to enjoy your Halloween,\" the organization said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/21/blue-bucket-halloween-may-signal-child-has-autism/4005473002/", "description": "A mom of a son, who is nonverbal, hopes a blue bucket on Halloween will spread autism awareness.
