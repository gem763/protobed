Katie Porter (D-CA) and other freshmen House Democrats as they arrive at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-KY) office to deliver a letter \"urging him to end the shutdown\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 16, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nHill, a 32-year-old California Democrat who was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018, posted her resignation letter to Twitter, saying she believed it best for her constituents, community and the country.\n\nHill has admitted to an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a campaign staffer when she was running for Congress but denied she had a sexual relationship with a staffer in her office, according to media reports.\n\nThe ethics committee said on Wednesday it was \u201caware of public allegations... (that Hill) may have engaged in a sexual relationship with an individual on her congressional staff,\u201d and said it was investigating.\n\nHill, who is going through a divorce, apologized in her resignation letter for \u201cmistakes made along the way\u201d but also lamented a \u201csmear campaign\u201d.\n\nHill blamed her husband and said she was pursuing legal options after media outlets published intimate photos that purported to be of the lawmaker.\n\n\u201cHaving private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy,\u201d said Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal.\u201d\n\nHill serves on the House Armed Services and Oversight and Reform Committees, where she is also vice chair.\n\nShe defeated incumbent Republican Steve Knight in a district north of Los Angeles, helping the Democrats win control of the House. Her district is seen by election analysts at the Cook Political Report as one of the most competitive in the country.\n\nAlthough Hill\u2019s departure could help Republicans win back her seat in November 2020, they still face an uphill climb in their effort to regain control of the House.", "description": "U.S. Representative Katie Hill, who is under investigation by the House ethics committee over an alleged relationship with a congressional staffer, said on Sunday that she was resigning from Congress.", "authors": ["Pete Schroeder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445661749&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R00D", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
