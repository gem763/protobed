You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMeanwhile, the scandal around Mr Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine has deepened after a senior administration official reportedly said the president asked his acting chief of staff to withhold millions of military aid to Ukraine shortly before he pressured the country to investigate the son of his main 2020 rival Joe Biden.\n\nAnd on Monday, Mr Trump ended a press conference with the extraordinary claim that \u201cif a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did \u2026 they\u2019d be getting the electric chair\u201d.\n\nA senior US senator is demanding an investigation into the Trump administration\u2019s withholding of aid from Ukraine, Reuters reports.\n\nSenator Bob Menendez, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said Congress was not made aware of any policy reason for withholding the funds and \u201cit is becoming clear that\u201d Mr Trump put pressure on Ukrainian officials.\n\nIn one of three letters sent to Trump administration officials, Mr Menendez wrote:\n\n\u201cWe must immediately understand whether, and to what extent, the president and his team converted duly-appropriated United States foreign assistance funds for his personal and political benefit, and what role federal agencies may have played in it.\" Is there finally enough momentum behind impeachment for Democrats to go all-in on it? Some political journalists think so today\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Warren, who has repeatedly called for impeachment since April, has just tweeted that an investigation into Mr Trump \u201cmust start today.\"\n\nThis tweet from British journalist Robert Peston suggests Mr Trump\u2019s meeting with Boris Johnson is still set to go ahead as he is expected to fly back to the UK overnight tonight.\n\nThat means we could be getting the president\u2019s take on the UK court\u2019s controversial ruling later today.\n\nAdvertisement Three Democrats have just backed impeachment, including another member of Congress from the important \u201cfrontline\u201d group of vulnerable 2020 representatives.\n\nAntonio Delgado has joined Haley Stevens from the frontline group, while representative Tom Souzzi has also backed an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, Connecticut\u2019s Chris Murphy has come forward for an inquiry \u2013 arguing that \u201cthe seriousness of the moment requires all of us to speak out in order to preserve our nation\u2019s commitment to the rule of law\u201d.\n\nBernie Sanders has announced his \u201cextreme wealth tax\u201d, which he says will fund his Medicare for All healthcare plan and other initiatives by taxing fortunes worth more than $32m.\n\nHere\u2019s how the tax would work in brief:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement alongside the announcement, Mr Sanders said: \u201cEnough is enough. We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy.\"\n\nWhen asked by the New York Times\u2019 Thomas Kaplan if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr Sanders simply replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see if the plan is enough to wrestle some momentum off Elizabeth Warren on the left-wing of the Democratic primary. Here\u2019s why Haley Stevens backing impeachment is an important development for Democrats.\n\nAs Politico\u2019s Melanie Zanona has noted, Ms Stevens is a member of the \u201cfrontliner\u201d group \u2013 a list of 44 Democratic incumbents who are thought to be vulnerable in the 2020 election.\n\nThat\u2019s important because if vulnerable Democrats are getting behind impeachment that suggests the potential political consequences of an inquiry no longer outweigh the ethical argument for an investigation.\n\nThis is strange. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has said 10 members of its delegation to the UN General Assembly have been denied US visas, AP reports.\n\nMaria Zakharova, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told Russian news agencies that Moscow is \u201coutraged\u201d that its members were denied visas ahead of the event in New York.\n\nShe said the visa applications were returned with an explanation that they had been submitted too early but were returned too late to be resubmitted.\n\nDmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, has accused the United States of breaking its international obligations by preventing the Russian officials from traveling to the event. Advertisement Another Democratic member of Congress has come forward to call for an impeachment inquiry. Haley Stevens, a congresswoman for Michigan, has said Mr Trump\u2019s alleged actions represent \u201can impeachable offence\u201d if they are confirmed.\n\nOn Mr Trump\u2019s relationship with Ukraine, our reporter Chris Baynes has the full story on the allegations that the president withheld $400m in military aid days before his controversial call with the country's leader.\n\nMr Trump is supposed to be meeting Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, in New York today but that might change as the UK Supreme Court has just dropped a damaging ruling for Mr Johnson's government.\n\nThe court ruled this morning that Mr Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament was unlawful, meaning MPs will be called back to work tomorrow.\n\nIt is currently unclear at this time if Mr Johnson\u2019s schedule is expected to change.\n\nYou can read more about that story below:\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he expects a \u201cmeaningful, substantive\u201d meeting with Mr Trump this week and has reiterated his country\u2019s need for US support, Reuters reports.\n\nHowever, in comments released by his office today, Mr Zelenskiy did not refer to the allegations that Mr Trump pressured him to investigate Joe Biden in exchange for US military aid. The Ukrainian president will be meeting with Mr Trump during a trip to the United States for the UN General Assembly this week. Advertisement In 2020 news, Bernie Sanders is apparently planning to unveil a wealth tax that is \u201ceven more aggressive\u201d than Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cultra-millionaire tax\u201d, according to Axios.\n\nMs Warren\u2019s plan would tax the wealth of households with a net worth of $50m or more \u2013 roughly the wealthiest 75,000 households, according to her campaign website.\n\nThose households would pay an annual 2 per cent tax on every dollar of net worth above $50m and 3 per cent on every dollar of net worth above $1bn.\n\nThe apparent move by Mr Sanders comes as the senator has fallen behind Ms Warren in the 2020 Democratic field.\n\nOn the topic of impeachment, Al Weaver from The Hill has reported that one House Democrat told him you can \u201cTake it to the bank\u201d that Ms Pelosi will support a move against the president this week. The unnamed Democrat added that a number of \u201cfrontline members\u201d will be publicly supporting impeachment this afternoon.\n\nFox & Friends is up and running this morning and their top story is not the revelation that Mr Trump allegedly withheld military aid from Ukraine days before he called the country\u2019s president.\n\nInstead, they are downplaying the whisteblower\u2019s complaints that Mr Trump behaved improperly. As Fox & Friends is one of the president\u2019s favourite programmes, it will be interesting to see if he comments on the show's account later today.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Mr Trump and his conversation with Ukraine, this is what those seven Democratic members of Congress wrote in the Washington Post last night:\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States may have used his position to pressure a foreign country into investigating a political opponent, and he sought to use US taxpayer dollars as leverage to do it. \"He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain. \"These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.\u201d The freshman representatives, who are notable due to their background in national security, concluded their article with the following statement: \u201cThese new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. \u201cWe must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.\" Advertisement Mr Trump is not alone in mocking Greta Thunberg, as Fox News also got in trouble yesterday when a conservative pundit referred to her as a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child\u201d on one of its programmes.\n\nMichael Knowles, who hosts a podcast for Ben Shapiro\u2019s Daily Wire website, dismissed the latest wave of climate activism as \u201chysteria\u201d. Greta, who is a 16-year-old, was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s \u2013 a form of autism \u2013 in 2015. Our reporter Vincent Wood has more on that story below: Another major Trump story today is his bizarre claim that he would get a Nobel prize for \u201ca lot of things, if they gave it fairly\u201d.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s main issue appears to be with Barack Obama\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize, which he received during his first term in 2009.\n\nAs for his \"electric chair\" comment about Joe Biden, it came as the former vice president called on Mr Trump to release the transcript of his controversial conversation with Ukraine.\n\nThe controversy stems from his request to Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden and his son.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Biden is currently the front-runner in the race to select the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate. In other news, Mr Trump has been accused of mocking climate activist Greta Thunberg by describing her as a \u201cvery happy young girl\u201d after she gave an emotional speech condemning world leaders\u2019 failure to tackle climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd an op-ed by the publisher of The New York Times yesterday claimed that the Trump administration failed to help one of their journalists when they faced arrest in Egypt two years ago.\n\nThe alleged failure forced the newspaper to ask Ireland to help with rescuing the reporter.\n\nAdvertisement 1 2 Next\n\nPlease allow the live blog time to load...", "description": "House speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly preparing to drop her long-held opposition to impeaching Donald Trump as Democrats were said to be \"reaching a tipping point\" on Monday.
