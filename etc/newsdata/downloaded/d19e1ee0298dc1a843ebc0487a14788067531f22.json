The Arlington partnership says it will commit to renewing the contract and ensure that rents stay stable in the property, where 82 percent of units serve households that make less than 30 percent of Montgomery\u2019s Area Median Income \u2014 about $36,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great news,\u201d said Montgomery County Council member Hans Riemer (D-At Large), who chairs the council\u2019s housing committee. \u201cWe need all hands on deck here. \u2026 The more competition in the sector, the better.\u201d\n\nHousing experts say the partnership\u2019s decision to expand across the Potomac River is both a symptom and a response to a growing list of issues affecting the entire Washington region, pushing local actors to work beyond their jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at this inflection point with affordable housing where we have all these different forces together, putting pressure on the region,\u201d said Montgomery Housing Partnership President Rob Goldman.\n\nHe cited escalating rates of gentrification in the District, Amazon\u2019s decision to locate a second headquarters in Arlington, and the construction of the Purple Line light rail connecting Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOrganizations are looking regionally because these are regional problems with regional implications,\u201d said Gustavo Velasquez, director of the Urban Institute\u2019s Washington-Area Research Initiative, which released a report last month declaring that the region needs to collectively add 374,000 housing units by 2030.\n\nThe report said Montgomery \u2014 Maryland\u2019s largest jurisdiction, with a population of about 1 million \u2014 needs to add 23,100 low-cost housing units, the most of any individual county or city.\n\nIn recent years, nonprofit groups that have traditionally operated within a single county or city have identified new opportunities in neighboring jurisdictions \u2014 not just in terms of need, but in terms of resources, Velasquez said.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Arlington partnership decided in 2018 to look for outside projects, it did so for two main reasons, said chief executive Nina Janopaul: The organization had the capacity to expand beyond the Virginia county of 230,000; and it was becoming increasingly clear that there was an equal, if not more dire need for affordable housing elsewhere. \u201cThe problem is big in Arlington, but it\u2019s even bigger in Fairfax and in Montgomery,\u201d Janopaul said.\n\nAD\n\nIn the 2019 fiscal year, Montgomery invested a record $107.3 million in affordable housing through its Housing Initiative Fund \u2014 nearly eight times more than Arlington\u2019s own fund of about $14 million.\n\n\u201cIn Arlington, there\u2019s simply a finite number of projects they could fund every year,\u201d Janopaul said. \u201cWe have a strong and robust staff, we have some capital reserves \u2026 To some degree, we have to be opportunistic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Arlington partnership purchased Snowden\u2019s Ridge for $18.5 million, $2.75 million of which was a loan from Montgomery\u2019s Housing Initiative Fund.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about this specific project,\u201d said Stephanie Killian, who leads the county\u2019s housing division. \u201cThe Section 8 vouchers attached to the unit \u2014 they\u2019re very precious.\u201d\n\nGoldman, who runs the Montgomery housing partnership, said the organization\u2019s acquisition of a property in Southeast Washington earlier this year is part of a\u201cgrowth model\u201d that could also allow them to expand existing operations in Montgomery.\n\nAD\n\nVelasquez, however, noted that the growth of housing nonprofits is still significantly limited by the extent of government funding available.\n\nAD\n\nHe said elected officials in Montgomery, Arlington and elsewhere should follow D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) in setting clear numerical targets \u2014 and therefore solid commitment, Velasquez argues \u2014 for affordable housing units.\n\nBowser has pledged to add 12,000 affordable housing units by 2025, and on Tuesday, she unveiled specific goals for where to locate them.\n\n\u201cUltimately, these organizations rely on dollars,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cAnd right now, no question \u2014 D.C. is ahead.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The purchase of a property in suburban Maryland comes amid a growing regional focus on affordable housing.", "authors": ["Rebecca Tan", "Local Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vEzJnKfw9LeW3pgvJpiH1lu7ze8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YZF5AWHQIMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
