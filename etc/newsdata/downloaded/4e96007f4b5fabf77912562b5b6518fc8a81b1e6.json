Even the lead guest for the GOP isn\u2019t pure upside for Trump, though. That would be Ron Johnson, who\u2019ll appear on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to discuss what Trump and Gordon Sondland told him in their phone calls about Ukraine in late August. Sondland claimed there was a quid pro quo in the works; Trump adamantly denied it. If Johnson believes Trump, why does he think Sondland came to the conclusion that a bargain with the Ukrainians involving the Biden probe was in the works?\n\nElsewhere for Republicans, it\u2019ll be Jim Jordan on \u201cThis Week\u201d and Chris Stewart, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Expect each to make the point that it\u2019s time for Pelosi to hold a floor vote formally authorizing an impeachment inquiry. That way, Republicans will gain some subpoena power of their own in this process.\n\nAs for the Democrats, various House committee movers and shakers are on tap to comment on the text messages revealed this week by Kurt Volker and to plot the way forward on impeachment. Eliot Engel, the head of the Foreign Affairs Committee that interviewed Volker, is scheduled for \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Val Demings, a member of the Judiciary Committee (which will authorize final articles of impeachment), will sit down with \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d And Hakeem Jeffries, the head of the Democratic caucus, has \u201cThis Week\u201d on tap. An obvious question for each: Do they think Trump is guilty of impeachable offenses based upon what we already know, e.g., the \u201ctranscript\u201d of his call with Zelensky? Or are they nominally reserving judgment while they build the case?\n\nIf none of that grabs you, two of Trump\u2019s primary challengers are also set to pile on about Ukraine this morning. Both Mark Sanford and Joe Walsh will speak to \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The full line-up is at the AP.", "description": "Quid pro quo?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
