Burns Pet Food was also discovered to have received former racehorses.\n\nThe findings raise serious questions about the enforcement of Racing NSW\u2019s own rules, which effectively ban horse owners and breeders from disposing unwanted thoroughbreds to slaughterhouses.\n\nDespite the troubling findings, O\u2019Farrell said state racing industry leaders are working to ensure \u201cequine welfare is as high as possible within their jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Racing NSW chief Peter V\u2019Landys told the ABC perpetrators will be punished.\n\nThe shocking report comes as the nation gears up for peak racing season, with the Melbourne Cup and Sydney\u2019s controversial The Everest slated for the coming weeks.\n\nAfter all, whipping horses to make them sprint around a dirt circle remains totally above board.\n\nThe 7.30 findings also echo a similar landmark, Gold Walkley-winning investigation into the Australian greyhound racing industry, which resulted in seismic changes across the board.\n\nYou can watch the programme here.\n\nREAD MORE The Melbourne Cup\u2019s Got A Blank Space Cuz Taylor Just Up And Cancelled", "description": "Barry O'Farrell said he was \"shocked\" by the '7.30' investigation.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/horse-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
