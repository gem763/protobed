The company planned to partner with Saudi Arabia on a massive, high-speed pneumatic transit system, and Branson suspended a $1 billion investment into his space company, Virgin Galactic, from Saudi Arabia's public investment fund.\n\nTrump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, boycotted the event over bipartisan backlash to the Saudi kingdom's suspected role in Khashoggi's disappearance.\n\nLarry Fink, BlackRock's billionaire CEO, reportedly pressed Saudi officials to postpone the event but later decided to drop out given the political climate. Steve Schwarzman, CEO of The Blackstone Group, reportedly acted in a similar manner before pulling out too.\n\nOne year after his brutal murder, there are now audio recordings, Saudi admissions, and a 100-page UN report that reveal stunning details about the Kingdom's alleged role in the execution plot and its extensive cover up attempts.\n\nBut remnants of last year's outrage seemed to have dissipated on Tuesday, as scores of global executives and political leaders descended upon the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh for this year's conference. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which organized the event, said that 6,000 people registered to attend this year's event, according to The New York Times.\n\nIn total, over 150 executives across the world confirmed their attendance.\n\n\"It's always great to be in the kingdom,\" Fink said during an opening panel, according to The Times. Schwarzman from the Blackstone Group, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, and Michael Corbat, the head of Citigroup, were also in attendance.\n\nVirgin Hyperloop One CEO Jay Walder said in promotional material for the event that he was \"delighted\" to attend and showcase the companies new initiatives. According to The Times, Virgin Hyperloop One even rented out a massive display board to endorse its projects in the Kingdom.\n\nTrump administration officials were also in attendance. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, joined outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin at the elaborate event.\n\nAccording to The Times, Trump called Prince Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the conference and stressed the two nations' \"continued strong partnership.\"\n\nFormer World Bank president Jim Yong Kim pulled out of last year's conference, but this year the new president, David Malpass, chose to attend.\n\n\"I'm not sure what has changed since last year when the World Bank and the world community said we are not gong to be a party to corruption, harassment of dissidents and to extrajudicial killings,\" Paul Cadario, a former World Bank senior manager, told The Times.\n\nBut for many attendees, the prospect of investing in Saudi Arabia's emerging economy, which has seen vast cultural reforms over the last few years and ranks within the top 20 nations on earth in terms of annual gross domestic product, was enough to cast any political apprehension aside.", "description": "Last year, dozens of businesses and executives shunned Saudi Arabia's annual investment conference.
