TSMC gave that sales outlook after reporting net income of NT$101.1 billion ($3.3 billion) for the September quarter, handily beating estimates as the global chip market recovers.\n\nTSMC, the main chipmaking partner to Apple and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co., is benefiting from reinvigorated smartphone sales. Lower prices and aging handsets are helping drive demand for the iPhone 11 range, and Apple is said to be asking its assemblers to target the high end of an original forecast for 70 million to 75 million unit shipments in 2019.\n\nRead more: Apple\u2019s Lower Prices, Users\u2019 Aging Handsets Drive IPhone Demand\n\nTSMC and its industry peers have grappled with a plateauing smartphone market, efforts by top customer Apple to move beyond hardware, and U.S. tech-export curbs on No. 2 customer Huawei. But investors are growing more confident that the latest iPhones are firing up consumers. TSMC is in fact straining against capacity constraints in the current quarter, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Li said.\n\nThe \u201ciPhone is driving stronger near-term demand. We believe the competitive pricing of iPhone 11 is garnering good traction and has prompted Apple to place more orders at the supply chain,\u201d Li said in an Oct. 10 note.\n\nRevenue was NT$293 billion according to previously reported sales data. Shares of TSMC climbed to a record in October on optimism over the latest iPhones. They closed about 1% lower ahead of the earnings report.\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Debby Wu in Taipei at dwu278@bloomberg.net;Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Peter Elstrom\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the primary chip supplier to Apple Inc., projected current-quarter revenue ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates after the latest iPhones proved a hit with consumers.The world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker foresees revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion", "authors": ["Debwu", "Gao Yuan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R7wGQTrJ4PtquN20w8pYmg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/c60ba212e395c2c7a23f7ce97840dae7", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
