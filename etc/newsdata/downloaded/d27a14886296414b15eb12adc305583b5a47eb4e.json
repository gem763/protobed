The bill pitched to us in the last Parliament is different to the bill before the Parliament now. It is different in meaningful ways,'' Mr Chalmers said.\n\nHowever, all the concessions were made by the government in December last year, six months before the election, to placate a hostile business sector and Liberal backbench.\n\nLabor was unmoved back then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This ridiculous policy, this Venezuelan-style intervention, this intervention in the economy which would chill investment, has collapsed under its own weight,\" then shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said.\n\nThe caucus agreed to support the legislation on the basis the privatisation clause was tightened so there could be no partial privatisation of an asset. Labor will also insist on a review of the laws some time before they expire to gauge whether they were having detrimental effects, either on prices or investment.\n\nGiven up the fight\n\nThe government said it would accede to these demands. The bill should pass the Lower House next week and the Senate next month, making the laws operational before Christmas.\n\nThe energy sector has all but given up the fight against the laws following Labor coming on board. It still, however, remains concerned at a provision that enables the government to compel companies to supply electricity at a fixed price, quantity and duration for up to three years.\n\nLabor is also grappling with where to go on climate change policy. Frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon was attacked by colleagues from both factions this week for suggesting Labor adopt the Coalition's lower 2030 emissions reduction target of 28 per cent on 2005 levels.\n\nLabor went to the election promising 45 per cent.\n\nMr Albanese said Labor's climate policy would not be announced until closer to the next election but it would be more robust than what Mr Fitzgibbon was proposing.\n\n\"We will decide our targets and our policy, and we'll do it in accordance with the science.\"", "description": "Labor launched an attack on the government's big stick energy laws just hours after capitulating and agreeing to support them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2908%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_111%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6b0785abfc84d1e096b1f808f2cd159bc6fb1053", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
