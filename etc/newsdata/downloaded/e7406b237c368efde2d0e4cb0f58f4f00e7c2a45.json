Now imagine if solar cells could be built directly into the very fabric of your house. You just imagined something called \"building-integrated photovoltaics\" - and the technology exists right now.\n\nDespite being such a sunkissed country, Australia is still lagging behind in the race to embrace solar power. While solar panels adorn hundreds of thousands of rooftops throughout the nation, we have not yet seen the logical next step: buildings with solar photovoltaic cells as an integral part of their structure.\n\nOur lab is hoping to change that. We have developed solar roof tiles with solar cells integrated on their surface using a specially customised adhesive. We are now testing how they perform in Australia\u2019s harsh temperatures.\n\nOur preliminary test results suggest that our solar roof tiles can generate 19% more electricity than conventional solar panels. This is because the tiles can absorb heat energy more effectively than solar panels, meaning that the tiles\u2019 surface heats up more slowly in sustained sunshine, allowing the solar cells more time to work at lower temperatures.", "description": "One of the major stumbling blocks when it comes to solar panels is their size and appearance - who wants to bung a bunch of huge, ugly oblongs all over their house?
