Facebook joined in on testing the same thing in Australia this month. So far, the tests seem to be yielding promising results, according to Instagram Director of Fashion Partnerships Eva Chen, who has also been a guinea pig for the company.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like I don't really check the number of likes an image gets anymore, because it's actually two steps to find the number of likes,\u201d she said at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit: Generational Opportunities last week. \u201cThe thinking behind hiding [likes] or making it not the first thing we see is really just to free up expression and creativity.\u201d\n\nInstagram director of fashion partnerships Eva Chen participates in the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit at Union West on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, in New York.

That same belief was part of Instagram\u2019s big push to roll out Instagram Stories, its competitor to Snap\u2019s posts that disappear after 24 hours.\n\n\u201cI just kind of feel like it's closer to Stories, where you kind of post, and you're like, \u2018Whatever, it's out there in the ether.\u2019 And I definitely feel more liberated to post,\u201d she said.\n\nAn independent survey from influencer consulting firm Paid this summer yielded mix reviews of Instagrams moves, however. In a survey of nearly 200 Canadian creators, 35% of users exposed to the test voiced displeasure on the feature compared to 34% of users who enjoyed it. Another 31% remained undecided.\n\nYet, as Chen points out, the impacts of hiding likes might not be felt equally among all Instagram users.\n\n\u201cPut yourself in the shoes of a 15-year-old who spent like an hour thinking about what she wanted to post, and then when she doesn't get the number of likes, she might take it down, or feel self-conscious,\u201d she said. \u201cInstagram really wants to be the safest platform, and friendliest platform, and kindest platform out there and this is just one step that we're testing to see what the response is. And so far it's, been very positive.\u201d\n\nWatch the complete interview with Instagram\u2019s Eva Chen and Facebook Chief Creative Officer Mark Darcy here:\n\nZack Guzman is the host of YFi PM as well as a senior writer and on-air reporter covering entrepreneurship, cannabis, startups, and breaking news at Yahoo Finance.
