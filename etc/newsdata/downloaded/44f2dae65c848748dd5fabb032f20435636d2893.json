Now an NFL analyst for Fox Sports, Gronkowski said he\u2019s satisfied with his decision to leave the game after nine seasons with the Patriots. \u201cI say it all the time, I would have never left the game if I was going to be itching every single day,\u201d said Gronkowski. However, veteran wide receiver Julian Edelman believes that it would be \u201cawesome\u201d for the Patriots if Gronkowski comes out of retirement and join them in their hunt for a seventh Super Bowl trophy.\n\n\"I don't know. If he does (return), hey, that's awesome. We need it,\u201d Edelman told WEEI\u2019s \u201cThe Greg Hill Show\u201d when asked about Gronkowski\u2019s pronouncement that he will stay retired. Edelman clarified that Gronkowski\u2019s future is not his concern at the moment since he and the Patriots are focused on their Monday Night Football (MNF) showdown with the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. \u201cYou're worried about the Jets, who you're playing this week. That's how it goes,\u201d said Edelman.\n\nPatriots down two tight ends\n\nEdelman\u2019s statement about \u201cneeding\u201d Gronkowski was timely since the Patriots could possibly play the Jets with just two tight ends on their roster. Ryan Izzo missed Friday\u2019s practice because he\u2019s being evaluated for a concussion, according to Mike Reiss of ESPN. Reiss said Izzo\u2019s status against the Jets is questionable. Based on Reiss\u2019 report, Izzo could have sustained the concussion during Thursday\u2019s full-pads practice.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. NFL New England Patriots\n\nThis season, Izzo has six catches for 114 yards and a touchdown. Aside from Izzo, Matt LaCosse was the other tight end who has appeared in a game for the Patriots this season, but he\u2019s also down with an MCL sprain and could miss a few weeks. The Patriots currently have Ben Watson and Eric Tomlinson as tight ends, whom they both signed several days ago. The Patriots re-signed Watson just one week after releasing him due to the lack of a roster spot.\n\nIt was reported that, aside from a veteran wide receiver, the Patriots are looking to add another tight end to their roster before the Oct. 29 trade deadline. Among those being targeted, by the Patriots, are Atlanta Falcons tight end Austin Hooper and tight end O.J. Howard of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. There are reports that the Patriots are also interested in Cincinnati Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert.\n\nWatson excited to make season debut\n\nThis season was a roller-coaster ride for Watson, who came out of retirement and signed a one-year deal with the Patriots as replacement for Gronkowski. The 38-year-old Watson was suspended for four games due to violation of the league\u2019s substance-abuse policy. When his suspension ended, the Patriots did not activate him against the Washington Redskins and eventually released him.\n\nDays after, the Patriots signed him for the rest of the season and he\u2019s making his season debut against the Jets on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while, so I\u2019m excited to play a real football game Monday night, no less,\u201d said Watson, who played for the Patriots from 2004 to 2009.", "description": "Gronkowski recently declared that he\u2019s satisfied with his decision to leave the game.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Patriots Rumor", "Analyst Raises Potential Trade With Dolphins For Players Before Deadline", "Jets Amazed Brady S Longevity", "Reveals Secret To Successful Quarterback Sneak", "After Loss To Chiefs", "Analyst Says Broncos Should Consider Shipping Sanders To Patriots"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/18/os/b_1200x630/gronkowski-now-works-as-nfl-analyst-for-fox-sports-image-source-new-england-patriotsyoutube_2341507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
