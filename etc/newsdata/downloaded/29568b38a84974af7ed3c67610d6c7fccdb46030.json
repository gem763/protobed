Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was grateful Bertans didn\u2019t take the Wizards\u2019 final shot.\n\n\u201cI almost jumped out on the court,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe had a great game. He was wonderful. He\u2019s a super human being, a heck of a player. I\u2019m actually happy for him. He was great. He was great.\u201d\n\nBertans was traded to clear cap space for Marcus Morris, who agreed to a two-year deal with San Antonio only to back out of the agreement and instead sign a one-year contract with New York. Having already dealt Bertans, the Spurs opted to sign Trey Lyles.\n\n\u201cIt was emotional a little bit,\u201d Bertans said of his return. \u201cI spent a lot of time here. As I see it, even though I got traded, there\u2019s nothing but love for the Spurs and that\u2019s mutual.\u201d\n\nThat love was evident in Popovich\u2019s playful banter with Bertans on the court following the game and former Spurs general manager R.C. Buford\u2019s long embrace with Bertans in the Wizards locker room.\n\nBertans got to see the Spurs grind out a victory as an opponent for the first time in his four-year career. San Antonio recorded its 20th straight home victory over Washington with some late heroics.\n\nUsing a screen by LaMarcus Aldridge near midcourt, DeRozan drove to the basket and spun in a layup between Rui Hachiumra and Thomas Bryant, putting the Spurs up with 5.5 second remaining.\n\n\u201cI tell him all the time, I need you to take over at all times, not just when we really, really need it,\u201d San Antonio point guard Dejounte Murray said. \u201cBut he did his thing tonight. None of us were shocked or surprised. That\u2019s DeMar for you.\u201d\n\nBradley Beal attempted to force overtime with a driving layup, but Derrick White blocked his shot and grabbed the ball as the buzzer sounded.\n\n\u201cBottom line is, he didn\u2019t get the call,\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said, \u201cbut that\u2019s basketball. You move on to the next game. We keep playing like this, we\u2019re going to get the respect.\u201d\n\nAldridge led the Spurs with 27 points. Murray had 10 points, 10 rebounds and four assists and Bryn Forbes added 16 points.\n\nBeal had 25 points and Hachimura added 16 points for the Wizards.\n\nWashington\u2019s last victory in San Antonio was Dec. 11, 1999, when Mitch Richmond scored 31 points to beat Tim Duncan, who is now a Spurs assistant coach.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points, including the game-winning basket in heavy traffic in the final seconds, and the San Antonio Spurs beat the Washington Wizards.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Raul Dominguez"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/Wizards_Spurs_Basketball_02031.jpg-06497_c0-151-3626-2266_s1200x700.jpg?c018236fad6179a5142c2b55cdd091deba1ba32b", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
