But Wayne would be up there. He\u2019s a good laugh on a night out.\u201d\n\nCrouch is regarded as one of the finest strikers of his generation, having scored over 100 top-flight goals and also boasting an impressive international record of 22 goals in 42 games.\n\nDuring his career, which he called time on this year, he became known for busting out his trademark 'robot' dance when celebrating a goal.\n\n(Image: Publicity Picture)\n\nAnd the 38-year-old has opened up on how American icon Rourke once spotted him during a holiday in Miami, Florida.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI was going through a nightclub where there was a fella who looked like Mickey Rourke. This fella said to me, \u2018You\u2019re Robot Boy\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt WAS Mickey Rourke and we both started doing the robot dance. It ended up being a 4am-in-the-morning job.\n\n\u201c\u2018Tomorrow,\u2019 he said, \u2018let\u2019s do it again\u2019. So we had another great night out with him. At 9am the next day, there was a knock on the door. I looked through the spyhole and it\u2019s Mickey Rourke.\u201d", "description": "Retired striker Crouch enjoyed a glittering career in the Premier League which took in spells with the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images Sport", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Publicity Picture"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20589276.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-versus-Trinidad-and-Tobago-15th-June-2006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
