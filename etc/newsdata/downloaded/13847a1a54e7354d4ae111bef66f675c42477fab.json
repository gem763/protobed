You can form your own view.

We know that stigma continues to hold us back in ending HIV transmissions.\u201d\n\nGreen said that, according to a Terrence Higgins Trust poll, nearly half of people in Britain would not feel comfortable kissing someone who is HIV positive, even though it cannot be passed on in that way.\n\n\u201cTherefore it is so important to remove the fear associated with HIV if we are to reach zero new HIV transmissions by 2030 \u2013 which the UK government has committed to doing \u2013 so more people can come forward and get tested,\u201d he said.\n\nThomas told the i he feels \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the \u201cpositive reaction\u201d to his HIV diagnosis.\n\n\u201cMy message is about inspiring others to have the courage to speak out and not be afraid and to help educate people,\u201d the 45-year-old said.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, BBC aired documentary Gareth Thomas: HIV and Me.\n\nThe documentary followed Thomas as he learned more about the condition and sought to combat misunderstandings which continue to surround the subject.\n\nIf you need support or further information about HIV, you can contact the Terrence Higgins Trust helpline on 0808 802 1221. The helpline is open from 10am to 8pm, Monday to Friday.", "description": "A charity reported a surge in calls and online inquiries\u00a0after\u00a0Gareth Thomas\u00a0announced\u00a0he is HIV positive.", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/10/gareth-thomas-main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
