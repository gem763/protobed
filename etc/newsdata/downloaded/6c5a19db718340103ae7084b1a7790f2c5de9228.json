They called 188 offensive holding penalties in the first 33 games, including 10 in the Titans-Jaguars game.\n\nBy halftime, Brady was tweeting, \u201cToo many penalties. Just let us play!!!\u201d and then, \u201cI\u2019m turning off this game I can\u2019t watch these ridiculous penalties anymore.\u201d\n\nAnalyst Troy Aikman noted Brady\u2019s tweets on the game broadcast, saying, \u201cTom Brady is one of the least controversial people we have in our game. He is league royalty. When he makes a statement like that, that should get somebody\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nIt sure did.\n\nAl Riveron, the league\u2019s senior vice president of officiating, held a conference call with referees Saturday, ESPN reported, and they were instructed to stick to the backside holding calls and allow more time for O-linemen to get their hands inside the frame of defenders on front-side and other blocks.\n\nThe officials only flagged offensive holding 45 more times the rest of the weekend, an average of three a game, down from nearly six a game before Sunday.\n\nBrady tried to make nice with the officials a day after complaining about all the flags, saying, \u201cI\u2019m very pro-ref.\u201d\n\nThe backtracking by one of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars makes sense, because he relies on the officials to protect him when 300-pound defenders are bearing down on him in the pocket. Dolphins linebacker Raekwon McMillan told The Miami Herald that a member of the officiating crew told him after a legal hit on Brady last week, \u201cStay off Tom .\u201d\n\nOn his weekly Westwood One interview that aired Monday night, Brady explained his initial criticism, saying, \u201cI want to see tough, hard-nosed football. When I was watching the other night, I decided to turn it off because I didn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s what I was seeing.\u201d\n\nThe yellow flags were bringing another black eye to the NFL at a time when the Antonio Brown saga had consumed consumers\u2019 attention while the league was trying to celebrate its 100th season.\n\nANGRY BROWN\n\nOne of the NFL\u2019s most prolific receivers for a decade, Brown was traded out of Pittsburgh and released in Oakland after wearing out his welcome in both cities. The Patriots signed him anyway, and just days later a former trainer filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of rape. He played in one game, then was released Friday after the team learned he tried to intimidate a second woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nAfter thanking the Patriots for the opportunity and wishing them another Super Bowl win, Brown went on a Twitter rant on his first NFL Sunday without a team. He announced he was done for good with the league that exiled him and took shots at Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nANGRY BELICHICK\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick drew criticism on social media for staring down CBS Sports reporter Dana Jacobson, who asked him before the Jets-Patriots game what was the final straw with Brown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on the Jets today,\u201d Belichick replied, then stared at Jacobson for two seconds, ignoring her as she replied, \u201cThank you, Coach, thank you.\u201d\n\nMISSING MAN\n\nDetroit QB Matthew Stafford helped spring J.D. McKissic on a 44-yard reverse that set up a field goal in the Lions\u2019 27-24 win at Philadelphia.\n\nStafford was supposed to block the defensive end but none was there because the Eagles had just 10 men on the field.\n\n\u201cSo, I just kept moving and found the next guy,\u201d said Stafford, who shielded McKissic from three defenders on his way downfield.\n\nNICE CATCH\n\nEagles receiver Nelson Agholor is having fun with a fan who threw shade at him in a TV interview after saving children from a fire. Hakim Laws of West Philadelphia told reporters, \u201cWe was catching \u2018em \u2026 unlike Agholor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for being a hero in the community, would like to invite you and your family to the next home game,\u201d Agholor replied on Twitter as he shared the viral video of the man who couldn\u2019t help but get in a dig about the receiver\u2019s drops.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nWith contributions from AP Sports Writers Jimmy Golen and Kyle Hightower.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tom Brady has clout, and his indignation may have saved the NFL's 100th season from being ruined by the refs even though he backtracked like he was avoiding Shaq Barrett .", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/24/saints_seahawks_football_03343_c0-217-5184-3239_s1770x1032.jpg?8b8f23121690e0737bdb7f9c933479ff63e997a3", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
