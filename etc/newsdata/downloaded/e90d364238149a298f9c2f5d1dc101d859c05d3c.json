Britain's slow-motion Left-wing revolution just carried on, rolling over old and trusted rules and institutions, and crushing them into dust.\n\nLast week the court made a swift and cat-like grab for power, its sharp claws flashing as it swiped at Downing Street.\n\nThe decision, absurdly, was unanimous. Unanimity is surely for sheep, not for independent minds. The Supreme Court judges are pictured above\n\nThis, unlike so many of the things wrongly said to be 'historic', was a truly huge change in the way we are governed.\n\nLord Hennessy, the liberals' favourite liberal, exulted that Tuesday was the day when 'the constitution really did shift'.\n\nHe argued that 'the architecture of the British constitution will never be the same again' because 'the Supreme Court's reach\u2026 now penetrates the most intimate relationship in the British state, that between the head of government, the prime minister, and the head of state, Her Majesty the Queen.'\n\nLord Sumption, perhaps the cleverest lawyer in the country, said the decision was 'revolutionary'. He is right.\n\nBy the time the ruling was given, it was obvious there was no threat to Parliament. It had already defended itself robustly, without any aid from Brenda Hale (above) and her team of SuperJudges\n\nThis deep change has been brewing for a long time.\n\nAs one very senior judge has admitted, this country's grandest lawyers, ambitious to extend their reach, have recently developed methods that might be called the Baldrick Strategy \u2013 cunning and subtle ways of inventing laws out of nothing.\n\nIf not swiftly and firmly curbed, the Court can now use equally vague and feeble pretexts to start striking down any government action it does not like, urged on by wealthy individuals or corporations who share its liberal world view.\n\nThis was foolishly applauded by many on the Left.\n\nThey did not grasp that, however much they might enjoy watching Al 'Boris' Johnson looking silly, this was a direct blow at Parliament and at accountable power, things some of them still believe in.\n\nI should note at this point that I am not a supporter of Mr Johnson. I disapproved of his suspension of Parliament.\n\nI also agreed with the High Court when it backed Gina Miller, on Parliament's right to legislate on the activation of Article 50 of the EU treaty, back in 2016. I am not partisan on this issue. Anything but.\n\nProper Leftists should be careful what they wish for. What a pity that great English radical, Tony Benn, was not there to remind them of the questions we need to ask of anyone who has power: 'What power have you got? Where did you get it from? In whose interests do you use it? To whom are you accountable? And finally, how do we get rid of you?'\n\nYou would think from the squeals emitted by the 'Supreme' Court on Tuesday that Mr Johnson had surrounded Parliament with tanks, arrested the Speaker and declared that he would from now on rule in person. A protester is pictured above\n\nThey are excellent questions and, as we shall see, the 'Supreme Court' cannot answer the final three which are most crucial. Who do they serve? We do not know. Who is above them? It remains to be seen. How do we remove them? There is no obvious way.\n\nJust before this strange, unBritish chamber of sorrows was launched ten years ago, its future President, Lord Neuberger, spilled the beans in a BBC interview. He said there was a real risk of 'judges arrogating to themselves greater power than they have at the moment'. This was a reasonable prophecy.\n\nThe old court of final appeal, a committee of senior Law Lords, never called itself 'Supreme'. It understood that the Crown in Parliament is the only supreme thing in our constitution.\n\nUnlike the Blairites who invented the new court, it did not think Britain was the same as the USA.\n\nIt also did not sit in the grandiose white stone palace which the 'Supreme Court ' now occupies, a lovely, ornate listed building controversially converted to suit the new court, at a cost to the taxpayer of almost \u00a360 million.\n\nWhat did those who flattered and pampered this roomful of lawyers expect to happen?\n\nIf not swiftly and firmly curbed, the Court can now use equally vague and feeble pretexts to start striking down any government action it does not like, urged on by wealthy individuals or corporations who share its liberal world view\n\nWhen a newly qualified policeman puts on his new uniform, perhaps with boots and baseball cap, and is given handcuffs and tasers and club, it changes his behaviour.\n\nIf you call a group of confident, well-rewarded men and women 'supreme', when they are already used to wielding unquestioned power, and then give them a majestic headquarters just across the square from Parliament itself, you will change their behaviour. You will change it for the worse.\n\nLord Neuberger correctly worried back in 2009 that there was no way of telling where this would end.\n\nHe said then 'the danger is that you muck around with a constitution like the British Constitution at your peril because you do not know what the consequences of any change will be.'\n\nTo be fair to Lord Neuberger, he said at the time that he feared these developments. Lord Falconer, the Blairite crony and all-purpose radical lawyer who had pushed the changes through Parliament, was delighted by them.\n\nHe happily predicted 'the Supreme Court will be bolder in vindicating both the freedoms of individuals and, coupled with that, being willing to take on the executive.'\n\nBy bolder, he meant, more aggressive, and of course more revolutionary, just as he was.\n\nAnd the sorts of 'freedoms' he had in mind would be the freedoms beloved by Blairites, the vague and flexible 'human rights' which have made it so very hard to enforce old-fashioned commonsense law in recent years.\n\nMore recently, the same Lord Neuberger was talking to students at the Cambridge Union, and explained to them the huge powers of the United States Supreme Court to give orders to Congress and the President.\n\nHe then told them: 'We can't do that.' But he didn't quite mean it, for he continued: 'We get round that, the Judges get round that, by what Baldrick might call a 'cunning and subtle plan' of being able to 'interpret' statutes, and sometimes we interpret them quite, um, imaginatively, so as to, as we see it, 'comply with the rule of law.' '\n\nNo better description has been given of the Baldrick-style verdict of Lady Hale's court last Tuesday. It is full of 'imaginative interpretation'.\n\nLess politely, you could say that it makes up a whole new law out of nothing. It claims to do this to defend Parliament from the Executive. But in fact it is only able to do it because it has scented just how weak the current Government is.\n\nIt is interesting to compare it with the Baldrick-free judgment on exactly the same case given by the old-fashioned High Court on September 11.\n\nThat court \u2013 three very clever English judges \u2013 said simply that the prorogation of Parliament was a political affair and none of their business. This is what any English court would have said at any time in the past two centuries of parliamentary democracy.\n\nJohn Finnis, Professor Emeritus of Law and Legal Philosophy at Oxford, is even more devastating. He says the judges dangerously evaded Britain's most fundamental constitutional statute, the 1689 Bill of Rights.\n\nThis declares: 'Proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament.'\n\nIn other words, the courts are simply forbidden from interfering with Parliament.\n\nThe court got round this by claiming the prorogation itself was somehow not a 'proceeding in Parliament'.\n\nAs one very senior judge has admitted, this country's grandest lawyers, ambitious to extend their reach, have recently developed methods that might be called the Baldrick Strategy \u2013 cunning and subtle ways of inventing laws out of nothing\n\nBut the same 'Supreme Court' ruled in 2014 that the granting of Royal Assent to a Bill, a very similar action to prorogation, was a proceeding in Parliament, saying 'the Queen in Parliament is sovereign and its procedures cannot be questioned in the courts of the United Kingdom.'\n\nThe High Court gave a history of prorogation over the last century, which showed that the Johnson suspension was not hugely exceptional in modern times.\n\nIt adds up to just ten working days, once you have subtracted from it the three weeks normally taken off by Parliament at this time of year.\n\nParliament was prorogued for three whole months in the summer of 1930, from August 1 to 28 October. In 1901 it was prorogued for even longer, from August 17 until November 5.\n\nThe now-sainted Clement Attlee, Labour's post-war reforming Premier, suspended Parliament to make radical reforms of the constitution. John Major is accused of suspending it to avoid embarrassment over a possible scandal.\n\nNo law or rule requires Parliament to sit in constant session, the judges rightly noted.\n\nBut you would think from the squeals emitted by the 'Supreme' Court on Tuesday that Mr Johnson had surrounded Parliament with tanks, arrested the Speaker and declared that he would from now on rule in person.\n\nThey showed a total loss of proportion when they airily dismissed as 'scant' the two giant obstacles to anyone who tries to rule this country without Parliament.\n\nThese are the need to raise taxes, which cannot be done without Parliament, and the Armed Forces Act, which must be renewed every year to keep a standing Army in being.\n\nFar from being 'scant' they are a huge iron wall against tyranny which cannot be breached.\n\nThere is more evidence of a collective rush of blood to the head in the judicial chamber. Towards the end of their judgment, they say Mr Johnson's suspension of Parliament 'had such an extreme effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy'.\n\nWhat are they on about? Ten days of vacation, during which Parliament in fact has little or nothing to do, does not have an 'extreme effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy'.\n\nAny reader of the judgment who has taken it seriously up till paragraph 58 must surely realise at this point that it has jumped the rails of reality.\n\nThe decision, absurdly, was unanimous. Unanimity is surely for sheep, not for independent minds.\n\nGiven that the three judges of the High Court had taken the opposite view, could the 'Supreme' court not manage a single dissenter?\n\nBy the time the ruling was given, it was obvious there was no threat to Parliament. It had already defended itself robustly, without any aid from Brenda Hale and her team of SuperJudges.\n\nThe fundamentals are quite unthreatened. Look what happened. In the short time available, despite the Prime Minister's supposedly despotic decision to extend their holidays, an uncowed Parliament gave Mr Johnson two big black eyes \u2013 stopping him from holding an Election and banning him from taking us out of the EU without a deal.\n\nWhen they eventually struggled back from their supposedly tyrannical suspension, bravely rescued by Judge Brenda from Mr Johnson's non-existent Stormtroopers, MPs instantly punched the Premier on the nose by refusing him even a few days off for the Tory conference, an act of spite.\n\nIt is not Mr Johnson who is doing the pushing around. If anyone needs rescuing by the courts, it is him.\n\nIf they thought a few days of prorogation were bad, let us see what they think of the Rule of Lawyers which now faces us and them. Judges at the Supreme Court are pictured above\n\nBut the new legal elite see themselves as heroes against a wicked Government. If you think these politicised judges are not at all full of themselves and vain, you might be interested to know that Lady Hale's interesting life, and supposed struggle against brutal misogynist discrimination, will shortly be celebrated in a children's book, Judge Brenda, Equal To Everything.\n\nAdvance publicity suggests that it will not be a critical study. It is, in fact, hard to find a critical study of this highly significant woman.\n\nWe still know remarkably little about her and her fellow judges. The Hale Court is now at least as significant as the Cabinet, but its members are for the most part a mystery to us. Two things could reasonably happen now.\n\nA miracle could occur and we could get a serious patriotic Government with a big majority, which would disband the court and nullify this ruling, returning things to where they were before the Blairite vandalism created this dangerous tribunal.\n\nOr public and politicians alike could demand to know, before they are appointed, what sort of people will sit in this new almighty Star Chamber. The US Supreme Court's Justices all undergo severe and searching hearings before Senators of both parties. If they are conservatives and male, they can nowadays pretty much expect to be accused of being sexual predators, or otherwise attacked.\n\nBut these hearings do at least ensure that the elected part of the US government has some idea of the people who have such awesome power over them, and who will take huge decisions for years to come.\n\nIf we cannot get rid of them, then we must know who they are and what they believe in. And if Parliament is not ready to curb this new overmighty subject, in one way or another, it can expect to be less and less powerful in the years to come.\n\nIf they thought a few days of prorogation were bad, let us see what they think of the Rule of Lawyers which now faces us and them.\n\nYou can follow Peter on Twitter @clarkemicah and read his blog at hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk\n\nIf you want to comment on Peter Hitchens click here.", "description": "PETER HITCHENS: The Hale Court is now at least as significant as the Cabinet, but its members are for the most part a mystery to us.
