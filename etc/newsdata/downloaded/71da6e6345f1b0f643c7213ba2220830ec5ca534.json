It did kill or capture many al Qaida terrorists, but it did not eliminate al Qaida.\n\nIn 2003, after invading Iraq, then-President George W. Bush converted the strategic aim of the United States in Afghanistan, Iraq -- and, indeed, the world -- into an ideological enterprise.\n\n\"We are committed to freedom in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in a peaceful Palestine,\" Bush said, standing on the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln off the coast of San Diego.\n\n\"The advance of freedom is the surest strategy to undermine the appeal of terror in the world,\" Bush said. \"Where freedom takes hold, hatred gives way to hope. When freedom takes hold, men and women turn to the peaceful pursuit of a better life. American values and American interests lead in the same direction: We stand for human liberty.\"\n\nTwo years later, Bush made this doctrine the centerpiece of his second Inaugural Address.\n\n\"(I)t is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world,\" he said.\n\nIn 2011, two years after Bush left office, the United States finally tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nHe was in Pakistan -- not Afghanistan.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump took office in 2017, the Afghan war was in its 16th year. That August, Trump announced a new South Asia strategy.\n\nIn announcing it, he rightfully criticized the manifestly futile nation-building policy promoted by Bush.\n\n\"I share the American people's frustration,\" Trump said then of the Afghan war.\n\n\"I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly lives, trying to rebuild countries in our own image, instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations,\" he said.\n\nTrump then defined what he believed \"victory\" would mean in Afghanistan.\n\n\"From now on,\" he said, \"victory will have a clear definition: attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaida, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\"\n\nThe first four things Trump mentioned here should only matter to our government if they lead to the fifth: stopping attacks against the United States.\n\nISIS -- the Islamic State group of Iraq and Syria -- did not emerge as a significant force until we invaded Iraq and overthrew Saddam Hussein. Now with Trump in his third year in office, ISIS' Khorasan branch has become a force in Afghanistan -- where both the Taliban and its al Qaida ally are still active.\n\nIn its latest report to Congress on this 18-year-old war, the Department of Defense summarized the situation on the ground.\n\n\"Terrorist and insurgent groups continue to challenge Afghan, U.S., and Coalition forces,\" said the DOD report.\n\n\"During this reporting period, ISIS-K made territorial gains in eastern Afghanistan,\" it said. \"Regionally the group continues to evade, counter, and resist sustained CT (counterterrorism) pressure.\"\n\n\"While ISIS-K remains operationally limited to South and Central Asia,\" it said, \"the group harbors intentions to attack international targets.\n\n\"Al-Qa'ida (AQ) and Al-Qa'ida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) routinely support, train, work, and operate with Taliban fighters and commanders,\" said the report.\n\n\"AQ maintains an enduring interest in attacking U.S. forces and Western targets,\" it said.\n\nPresident Trump this week ended negotiations with the Taliban after a Taliban suicide bomber killed an American soldier in Kabul.\n\nThe DOD report concluded that even if those negotiations had succeeded, they would not have stopped al Qaida, ISIS or even current members of the Taliban from continuing their activities in Afghanistan and posing a threat to the United States.\n\n\"Even if a successful political settlement with the Taliban emerges from ongoing talks, AQ, ISIS-K, and some unknown number of Taliban hardliners will constitute a substantial threat to the Afghan government and its citizens, as well as to the United States and its Coalition partners,\" said the DOD report.\n\n\"This enduring terrorist threat will require the United States, the international community, and the ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) to maintain a robust CT capability for the foreseeable future,\" it said.\n\nIt is a safe prediction that even if Trump serves two terms, the Taliban, al Qaida and ISIS will still exist and still be present in Afghanistan when he leaves office. It is a safe prediction they or their ideological offspring will outlast Trump's successor and his successor's successor.\n\nThe duty of our president is not to eliminate them from this Earth -- or even from Afghanistan -- but to prevent them from attacking Americans.\n\nTerence P.
