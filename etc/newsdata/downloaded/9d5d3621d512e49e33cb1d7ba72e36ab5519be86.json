There was no broadcast of the game after the North refused to screen it live\n\nReclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n\nLast year saw a flurry of sports diplomacy between the two but ties have since cooled over stalled negotiations over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nTottenham Hotspur striker Son Heung-min said it had been a bad-tempered match.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, the game was so tough that I think we were very lucky already to be back with no one injured,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday upon arrival at Incheon airport via Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe could even hear many of very offensive curses from the other side.\u201d\n\nChoi Young-il, vice-president of the South\u2019s Korea Football Association (KFA), said the North Korean players had been overly aggressive.\n\n\u201cIt was like war,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey would use everything from elbows to hands to knees to fend off our players. It was really difficult.\u201d\n\nEach side received two yellow cards.\n\n\u201cNorth Koreans wouldn\u2019t even make eye contact when I talked to them, not to mention respond,\u201d Choi said.\n\nChoi said the KFA planned to discuss whether it will raise a complaint with world governing body FIFA or the Asian Football Confederation about North Korea\u2019s handling of the game.\n\nIn a video shared on Twitter by the Swedish ambassador to North Korea Joachim Bergstrom, Son appeared to be trying to play peacemaker as players from the sides confronted each other.\n\n\u201cEmotions run high,\u201d Bergstrom wrote in a tweet. He was among only a handful of spectators allowed at the match along with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.\n\nThe North provided a recording of the match on DVD but South Korean public broadcaster KBS cancelled plans to air it on Thursday due to the poor quality of the footage.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul in charge of inter-Korean affairs said on Thursday it was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d that the North did not allow the live broadcast of the match.", "description": "South Korea were happy to have made it back from Pyongyang in one piece after Tuesday's brutal 2022 World Cup qualifier, with a Korean FA official describing the physical encounter as being \"like war\".", "authors": ["Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441796446&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0L4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
