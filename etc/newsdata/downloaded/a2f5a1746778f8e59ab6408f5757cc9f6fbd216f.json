Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Miami Herald reported earlier Thursday that the two quarterbacks split reps in Thursday\u2019s practice, a change from previous weeks after Fitzpatrick won the preseason competition.\n\nFitzpatrick, 36, is 25 of 50 for 274 yards, one touchdown and four interceptions \u2014 two returned for touchdowns \u2014 through two games.\n\nRosen, 22, has gone 8 of 21 for 102 yards and two interceptions in mop-up duty.\n\n\u2014Philadelphia Eagles are expected to be without wide receivers DeSean Jackson (lower abdomen) and Alshon Jeffery (calf) on Sunday against the Detroit Lions, and likely Week 4 as well.\n\nThe Eagles were missing seven key players at practice, including tight end Dallas Goedert (calf), who is also considered unlikely for Sunday.\n\n\u2014New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur no longer will appear weekly on Mike Francesa\u2019s radio show on WFAN, the team\u2019s flagship station.\n\nFrancesa was blunt with Shurmur about the play of the 0-2 Giants on Monday. \u201cYou look like a bad team through two weeks. I hate to say it, but you look like a terrible team. You\u2019re not good at anything.\u201d\n\nShurmur said the team brass decided to end the weekly spots.\n\n\u2014Carolina quarterback Cam Newton missed practice with a foot injury again, increasing the likelihood that the Panthers will start Kyle Allen on Sunday in Arizona.\n\nNewton aggravated a left mid-foot sprain during last Thursday night\u2019s loss and has not practiced since.\n\nHead coach Ron Rivera told reporters he wasn\u2019t yet sure whether Newton or Allen would start against the Cardinals, saying he would know more Friday.\n\n\u2014In his first public comments since joining the New England Patriots on Sept. 7, wide receiver Antonio Brown declined to address his status amid the league\u2019s investigation into sexual assault allegations against him.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that question,\u201d Brown replied when asked about the subject. \u201cI\u2019m just here to just focus on ball. I look forward to getting out there in the home stadium and being with the team.\u201d\n\nThe Boston Globe also reported that Nike has terminated its endorsement deal with Brown.\n\n\u2014Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner was critical of the performance of wide receiver Donte Moncrief, saying he\u2019s got to start hauling in catches.\n\nIn Week 1, Moncrief caught three of 11 targets for 7 yards, with four incompletions that hit both of his hands. Last week, Moncrief was targeted just once, watching the pass go off his hands and deflect for an interception.\n\n\u2014Denver Broncos general manager John Elway was frank about the rash of holding penalties racked up by left tackle Garett Bolles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotta stop. Period,\u201d Elway said on 850 KOA radio. \u201cThere\u2019s no more excuses for it. He\u2019s had 26 holding penalties in the last two years and two games, so it\u2019s gotta stop.\u201d\n\n\u2014Chicago Bears defensive tackle Bilal Nichols has a broken hand but will likely avoid injured reserve. He is unlikely to play Monday at Washington but could play with the hand wrapped into a club, according to head coach Matt Nagy.\n\n\u2014The Dolphins claimed former first-round defensive end Taco Charlton, 24, off waivers from the Cowboys. The two teams play each other Sunday.\n\n\u2014 The Green Bay Packers promoted tight end Evan Baylis from the practice squad as Jimmy Graham deals with a groin injury. Graham, 32, did not practice Thursday, and his status is murky for Sunday\u2019s game at Lambeau Field against the Broncos.\n\n\u2014Cowboys defensive end Tyrone Crawford is doubtful for Sunday due to a hip injury.\n\n\u2014Giants wideout Sterling Shepard is expected to clear the concussion protocol and play Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\u2014In addition to a groin injury, Oakland Raiders rookie running back Josh Jacobs said he also has an illness that has caused him to lose 10 pounds.\n\n\u2014 Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill is out of a sling this week, sparking speculation that he could return from a right clavicle injury before the original six- to eight-week estimate.\n\n\u2014Running back Marlon Mack (calf) and linebacker Darius Leonard (concussion) both missed their second straight day of practice. Coach Frank Reich is expected to announce their availability on Friday.\n\n\u2014Tight end Jordan Reed (concussion) remains out of practice, but the Washington Redskins haven\u2019t ruled him out of Monday night\u2019s game against the Bears.\n\nReed sustained the concussion in the preseason and has yet to be cleared to play.\n\n\u2014Buffalo Bills tight end Tyler Kroft, an offseason acquisition, has yet to play this season because of a broken right foot.\n\nIt appeared he might play Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals, but that is in doubt. He left practice with a right ankle injury, and coach Sean McDermott said the extent of the injury wasn\u2019t known yet.\n\n\u2014Four-time Pro-Bowl linebacker C.J. Mosley missed another practice, but coach Adam Gase wasn\u2019t ready to rule him out for Sunday when the New York Jets travel to meet the Patriots.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "A day after head coach Brian Flores affirmed veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Miami Dolphins reversed course and made Josh Rosen the starting quarterback for Sunday's game at the heavily favored Dallas Cowboys, according to multiple reports Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431809051&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J02W-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
