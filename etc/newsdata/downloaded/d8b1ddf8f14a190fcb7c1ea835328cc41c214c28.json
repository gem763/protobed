How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC? Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on the server. So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine.\u201d (Remarks at the White House, Oct. 16)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was a server \u2014 the DNC server \u2014 that never went to the FBI. The FBI didn\u2019t take it. It was taken by somebody that, I guess, it\u2019s CrowdStrike \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. And referring to that, that\u2019s not for an election that\u2019s going into the future, that\u2019s for a past election that was a catastrophe.\u201d (Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Oct. 21)\n\nTrump is fixated on the idea that Ukrainians might have hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s network in 2016 and framed Russia for the cyber intrusion.\n\nIt\u2019s a debunked conspiracy theory that Trump\u2019s own advisers have dismissed, flying in the face of detailed assessments from the U.S. intelligence community, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and the congressional committees that have investigated Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nAD\n\nThe Internet security firm CrowdStrike, based in California, first investigated the DNC hack in June 2016 and traced it to two groups of hackers that \u201cengage in extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the Russian Federation and are believed to be closely linked to the Russian government\u2019s powerful and highly capable intelligence services.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMueller\u2019s report found that, from April to June 2016, a Russian military intelligence agency called the GRU \u201ccompromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and shared file server.\u201d Russian officials first gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s network, \u201cusing the credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully spearphished.\u201d Within a week, the Russian officials \u201cgained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection between the DCCC and DNC networks.\u201d\n\nThe Russian officers \u201cstole thousands of documents from the DCCC and DNC networks, including significant amounts of data pertaining to the 2016 U.S. federal elections,\u201d according to the Mueller report, such as \u201cinternal strategy documents, fundraising data,\u201d \u201cthe DNC\u2019s opposition research into candidate Trump\u201d and apparently \u201cthousands of emails and attachments, which were later released by WikiLeaks in July 2016.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community assessed in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the cyber-intrusion campaign to help Trump win; damage his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton; and shake confidence in U.S. democracy.\n\nAD\n\nNevertheless, Trump often runs with an alternate-reality version of events involving Ukraine, CrowdStrike and a DNC server that has caught fire in some corners of the Internet and among right-wing supporters of the president. As the New York Times reported, Trump at times has gone further than some of the \u201cdarkest threads\u201d online:\n\nOn 4chan and pro-Trump spaces on Reddit, on websites like ZeroHedge.com and Washington\u2019s Blog, you can find plenty of speculation about evil manipulation by CrowdStrike and secret maneuvers by Ukrainians \u2014 often inflamed by Mr. Trump\u2019s own statements. Until the president\u2019s statements, however, even internet speculation did not attribute CrowdStrike\u2019s ownership to a rich Ukrainian or suggest that the D.N.C. servers were hidden in Ukraine.\n\nAs the conspiracy theory goes: A rich Ukrainian owns CrowdStrike, and a DNC server was transported to Ukraine after the 2016 hack, thwarting the FBI from taking possession of it and presumably from establishing conclusively that Russia was behind the intrusion.\n\nAD\n\nBut CrowdStrike is a publicly traded American company co-founded by U.S.-born George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch, who was born in Russia, is a U.S. citizen and \u201chas no connection to Ukraine,\u201d as the company said. The DNC server data was copied and submitted to the FBI.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Washington Examiner reported: \u201cA tenuous Ukrainian connection is that Alperovitch serves as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which receives funding from Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire who has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The DNC also had more than 100 servers, not just one.\u201d\n\nThe FBI and DNC disagree on whether the FBI requested access to the DNC\u2019s servers. Former FBI director James B. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau made \u201cmultiple requests at different levels\u201d to access the servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access. The DNC had CrowdStrike analyze its network and share findings with the FBI, which Comey called an acceptable substitute.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have never taken physical possession of any DNC servers,\u201d CrowdStrike said in a blog post. \u201cWhen cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that evidence in a process called \u2018imaging.\u2019 It involves making an exact byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the machine\u2019s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through the victim\u2019s network. This has been standard procedure in incident response investigations for decades. The images, not the computer\u2019s hardware, provide the evidence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCybersecurity expert Thomas Rid previously told us that \u201chanding over the server\u201d as Trump described could have destroyed evidence.\n\n\u201cWhat they need to see is how the traffic moves,\u201d said Rid, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. If investigators were surveilling a house, Rid said, they would want to know who goes in and out. The same is true of investigating server traffic, he added. Having the physical object, whether a house or a server, is not nearly as helpful as knowing who goes in and out, Rid said.\n\nAD\n\nThomas P. Bossert, who served as Trump\u2019s first homeland security adviser, said Sept. 29 that the president has been told the story is \u201ccompletely debunked.\u201d \u201cThe DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go,\u201d Bossert said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cIf he continues to focus on that white whale, it\u2019s going to bring him down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNo matter. Trump continues to repeat it, as recently as Oct. 21 in Fox News.\n\nIn a July 25 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the CrowdStrike-DNC tale. That request is now being examined by House Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, according to the rough transcript of the phone call released by the White House. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, a whistleblower wrote a false narrative of the conversation. Now they don\u2019t want to talk about the whistleblower because they didn\u2019t think I was going to release the conversation.\u201d (Remarks to reporters, Oct. 28)\n\nWe recently gave this claim Four Pinocchios based on a line-by-line analysis of the Aug. 12 complaint filed by an intelligence community whistleblower, which spurred the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt will be up to Congress to determine whether Trump has been \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d as the whistleblower alleged. Thus far, with the exception of some minor details, virtually all the specific points of the complaint have held up and been confirmed by additional information, documents and reporting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, the Trump administration\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor, echoed the central allegations in congressional testimony. Taylor, the U.S. charges d\u2019affaires in Ukraine, told lawmakers in closed-door testimony that \u201cthe White House had threatened to withdraw much-needed military aid unless Kyiv announced investigations for Trump\u2019s political benefit.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s recap what the whistleblower alleged: Trump in a phone call asked Zelensky to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation\u201d into former vice president Joe Biden and his son. (Correct.) Trump raised a conspiracy theory involving CrowdStrike. (Correct.) Trump told Zelensky to \u201cmeet or speak\u201d with his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Attorney General William P. Barr. (Correct.) U.S. officials intervened to \u201clock down\u201d records of the call. (Correct.)\n\n\u201cNobody thought I was going to release the conversation. I got the approval from Ukraine. Once I released the conversation, this thing all died.\u201d (Remarks to reporters, Oct. 28)\n\nThe evidence has grown and become more perilous for Trump after weeks of House investigators collecting witness testimony and records, as The Washington Post\u2019s Ashley Parker reported.\n\n\u201cOver two weeks of closed-door testimony, a clear portrait has emerged of a president personally orchestrating the effort to pressure a foreign government to dig up dirt on a potential 2020 political rival \u2014 and marshaling the full resources of the federal bureaucracy to help in that endeavor,\u201d The Post reported.\n\nTrump said the State Department sought authorization from Ukraine to release the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call with Zelensky. \u201cI personally think that sometimes such calls between presidents of independent countries should not be published,\u201d Zelensky told Ukrainian media while in New York last month, after the transcript was released, Reuters reported. \u201cI just thought that they would publish their part.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, testified to House committees that he believed opening \u201cinvestigations into Burisma Group \u2014 a gas company where Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s son once served on the board \u2014 and into alleged 2016 election interference was a condition for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal, which also quoted Sondland\u2019s attorney saying that when the ambassador was \u201casked by a lawmaker whether that arrangement was a quid pro quo, Mr. Sondland cautioned that he wasn\u2019t a lawyer but said he believed the answer was yes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a significant change from what Sondland said last month, when he denied in a text message to Taylor that Trump was engaging in a quid pro quo.\n\nTaylor texted Sondland on Sept. 9, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Five hours later, Sondland responded: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported that the content of that text message was relayed to Sondland \u201cdirectly by President Trump in a phone call\u201d and that Sondland had \u201cno knowledge of whether the president was telling him the truth at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since Trump released the rough transcript of the telephone call with Zelensky, the president\u2019s position has been continuously weakened,\u201d The Post\u2019s Dan Balz wrote, noting the whistleblower complaint, the testimony of former Trump administration officials Marie Yovanovitch and Fiona Hill, and Taylor\u2019s testimony, which \u201cadds significantly to the chronology of events, and with the kind of documentation that will be difficult to refute.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the reality, despite Trump\u2019s constant efforts to portray just the opposite.\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "description": "Trump falsely insists that a whistleblower misrepresented his phone call with the Ukrainian president and that the impeachment inquiry has lost all its steam even as the evidence becomes more perilous for him.", "authors": ["Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3A2Ze8Mb12zEyEUAc8KgsjplDbw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IC3WM7XZQQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
