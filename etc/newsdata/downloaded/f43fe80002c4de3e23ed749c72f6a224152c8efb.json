When there are new listings, the information is recorded and a staff member will make a house visit.\n\n\"We have gone to some pretty serious measures to collect. We have literally dug up driveways and turned off water sewer service until the bill is paid, cutting them off completely from all municipal services.\"\n\nThe Town of Bonavista says it's trying to level the playing field between Airbnb operators and operators of more traditional hospitality accommodations. (Marie Isabelle Rochon/CBC)\n\nThe mayor said the taxation method has been successful, but he acknowledges not all Airbnb owners are pleased.\n\n\"I don't think some are happy about it, but it is what it is.\"\n\nAirbnb property owners don't pay Canada Select Fees, site inspection fees for Service NL or provincial tourism registration fees, according to Norman, which he says is part of the reason owners of more traditional accommodations are upset.\n\nUnfair advantage, says bed and breakfast owner\n\nPatrick Alan Monsigneur, co-owner of the Claddagh Inn, a Saint Mary's bed and breakfast, says they've had a significant decline in clientele since Airbnb rentals started popping up in the area.\n\nHe said he's in favour of healthy competition, but believes there's an unfair disadvantage.\n\nB&B co-owner Patrick Monsigneur says he has seen a significant decline in clientele since Airbnb became popular around the Saint Mary's area. (Marie Isabelle Rochon/CBC)\n\n\"We are no longer on an even playing field because the competitors aren't paying taxes, and paying all the fees and meeting all the requirements,\" he said.\n\n\"We collect taxes for the government. Unregistered and unlicensed operations are not collecting those taxes.\"\n\nAirbnb says homes are not hotels\n\nAn Airbnb spokesperson told CBC the province is home to many operators trying to make ends meet.\n\n\"Airbnb believes in paying its fair share, but given the casual nature of home sharing, our hosts should not be treated like corporate hotels. We already work with the Canada Revenue Agency to remind hosts across the country of their obligations during tax season,\" said Alexandra Dagg in a statement.\n\nThe view of Bonavista from White Rock Trail. (Linda Lane)\n\nThe company said it is not aware of any other Canadian municipality that is taxing Airbnb hosts as businesses based on their property assessment value.\n\nMore regulations needed\n\nThe lack of regulations on Airbnb properties also concerns Larry Laite, chair of Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nThere are no health inspections, or inspections done by fire departments or service NL.\n\n\"It's something that we have asked \u2026 that there be a legislative review done and completed on the tourism establishment act so that they can be regulated and legislated,\" said Laite.\n\nHe wants Airbnb properties to undergo health and fire inspections, and other scrutiny that licensed businesses encounter.\n\n\"Without having those regulations and that comfort zone \u2026 we are concerned that this can damage the work that has taken place over the last 25 years to build Newfoundland into a destination that people want to come to.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "The Town of Bonavista\u00a0is getting tougher in its attempts to collect taxes from Airbnb operators as rental properties pop up in the popular Newfoundland and Labrador tourist destination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5276299.1568049867!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/john-norman.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
