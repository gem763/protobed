It\u2019s a magnificent occasion and it\u2019s up to us to put in the performance to match it. We are very motivated to do that.\u201d\n\nAssistant coach Martin Gaitan was singing from the same hymn sheet and, as a man who missed the magnificent 2007 campaign after discovering a career-ending heart problem on the eve of the tournament, he is well placed to encourage his charges to seize the day.\n\n\u201cFor many years we\u2019ve believed in what we\u2019ve been building and, win or lose, that\u2019s not going to be devalued and we will still believe in our game plan,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to control the ball as much as possible and play a fast game and maintain possession. England are a complete team but we need to focus on ourselves and what we are doing rather than the opposition.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a very difficult game for us, it\u2019s huge, we want to win, but it\u2019s also beautiful that we get to play in a match like this.\u201d\n\nIt would be the stuff of dreams for Argentina if they could hold England long enough for the game to be decided by a late penalty but should it come to that, Emiliano Boffelli said he is ready to step up to the plate.\n\nThe fullback slid a probable match-winning long-range effort just wide in the dying moments of the opening defeat against France and was asked on Friday if that had rattled him by the small band of Argentine journalists huddled in the bowels of the stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve no regrets about what happened in the French game,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got confidence and, depending on where it\u2019s awarded, if there is another kick I\u2019ll put my hand up again. I just do whatever I can to help the team.\u201d", "description": "Argentina are feeding off the emotion of what they know will be a monumental challenge against England on Saturday and are determined to express themselves despite the quality of the opposition and their own World Cup hopes being on the line.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436907057&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930BG", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
