He is worried he won\u2019t know how to operate such a complicated machine. So he called an electrician.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t wait, and we know it\u2019s gonna happen again,\" Schmaltz said in an interview inside a 7,000-square-foot storage cave, one of the only places at Bella Winery where it was safe to breathe without an air mask as new fires raged a few miles away.\n\nAD\n\nFor this tightknit community in the heart of wine country, parts of which were devastated by the deadly and destructive Tubbs fire in 2017, rolling blackouts are becoming a new way of life. Electricity \u2014 a basic necessity for keeping food fresh, medical devices running, businesses operating and children in school \u2014 is being cut unexpectedly in an effort to limit wildfires.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Sonoma. Millions of residents across California, including in the major San Francisco metro areas, were expected to lose power this weekend in a record event as power utility company Pacific Gas & Electric cut services in what it said was an effort to prevent fires \u2014 a new normal its executives have said could continue for a decade.\n\nAD\n\nThis weekend alone, parts of Northern California are bracing for dangerous fire conditions and the prospect of nearly a million power outages as a potentially \u201chistoric\u201d wind event was forecast to sweep into the state on Saturday.\n\nAD\n\nThe ongoing Kincade fire, which sparked Wednesday night in Sonoma and has consumed over 25,000 acres, is expected to worsen this weekend as strong winds, combined with low humidity, create what the National Weather Service called \u201cextreme fire weather conditions.\u201d State fire officials issued new evacuation orders on Saturday, bringing the total number of people ordered to flee the region to about 50,000 people.\n\nThese are just the latest examples of the changes roiling California as climate change leads to hotter, drier conditions. Every year, winds known as the Diablo in the north and Santa Ana in the south pick up after months of no rain. The last two wildfire seasons were the state\u2019s deadliest and most destructive in history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and climate change is a \u201ckey driver,\u201d the agency says.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile wildfires are a natural part of California\u2019s landscape, the fire season in California and across the West is starting earlier and ending later each year,\u201d the agency adds in a warning for this year on its website.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, PG&E\u2019s older network poses dangers as aboveground power lines have the ability to spark the next major fire with the next gust of wind. The utility company, which declared bankruptcy after its infrastructure caused the most deadly California wildfire on record last year, has deployed a new strategy: preemptively shutting off the power in an attempt to prevent disaster.\n\nThat includes calm and sunny days like earlier this month, said winemaker Schmaltz, when \u201cmaybe one hair on my head went out of position.\u201d It\u2019s a risk-averse strategy that has proved frustrating and controversial, though some residents said they became more understanding in recent days as communities there are again blanketed in smoke.\n\nAD\n\nEven a year ago, it was unthinkable that California \u2014 one of the most prosperous states in the country, which has spearheaded climate initiatives and taken the national lead in electric vehicle adoption \u2014 would be put in a situation where whole neighborhoods have a choice between sitting in the dark or relying on noisy gasoline generators to keep life going. In Sonoma, the hum is now a constant presence when the power goes out, like a chorus of lawn mowers in neighborhoods where there is no grass to trim.\n\nAD\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Friday lashed out at the utility company over what he called years of greed and mismanagement that brought about the crisis.\n\n\u201cThat greed has precipitated in a lack of intentionality and focus on hardening their grid, undergrounding their transmission lines,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference. \u201cThey simply did not do their job.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe said this can\u2019t continue.\n\n\u201cBut nonetheless we have to recognize we are living in a new world, particularly in a state like ours after a five-year historic drought, after 15 of the 20 most destructive fire seasons just since 2000 because of climate change,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThe hots are getting hotter, and the dries are getting drier, and the wets are getting wetter, which has aided and abetted these grass fires.\u201d\n\nThis week, despite power cuts in some areas, new fires raged in Sonoma County and near Los Angeles. Meanwhile, rolling blackouts were affecting swaths of the state, with more scheduled.\n\nAD\n\nThat meant California residents in areas where power is cut who bought air filters couldn\u2019t run them to rid their homes of smoke. There was no way to charge their cellphones. They were streaming into stores to buy lanterns and solar chargers.\n\nAD\n\nIn Sonoma, the new way of life is apparent. Residents look down at their phones as they receive texts from alert-system Nixle to notify them of wildfires or power outages. Lines to fill up at gas stations stretch into the road. Signs along the streets warn of the danger from power shut-offs, instructing motorists to treat stoplights as stop signs.\n\nSome mobile home communities here put out bids for generators to ensure continued water supply from a well. For now, a manager said, residents are filling up their bathtubs preemptively so they\u2019ll be able to flush their toilets when the power is out.\n\nAD\n\nThe Garrett Ace Hardware in Healdsburg, about a seven-mile drive from where the Kincaid fire began, has practically had to redefine its inventory \u2014 for the long haul, said manager Penny Arreguin.\n\nAD\n\nInside the store this week, workers were unloading 280 boxes of 10-count N95 masks, which filter out air particulates when it\u2019s smoky. Normally they only have 12 boxes in stock. Generators are flying off the shelves.\n\nThe hardware store has become the town supplier for all things fire and power outage, including hoses, sprinklers, batteries, flashlights, fire extinguishers, air purifiers, extension cords and camping and survival gear.\n\n\u201cThis is the new norm,\u201d said Arreguin. It\u2019s \u201cpreparing for the future.\u201d\n\nTanner Carlozzi, 24, has gotten used to the risk of fires, having grown up in the Healdsburg area and watching it turn from green to brown. He puts his perishables on ice and heads to his mother\u2019s home in nearby Windsor to check on her and his grandmother. He also makes sure their cars have fuel, and that food and water are stocked up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2017, he packed his belongings into boxes as fire consumed the area. Now he can\u2019t stand a bonfire or barbecue, worrying about the potential risk.\n\nIn the nearby Coffey Park neighborhood, houses were leveled in 2017 by the fires. This week, residents of the newly rebuilt homes were warned of potential power shut-offs as fires raged nearby.\n\nSome houses were still under construction. Workers\u2019 radios occasionally blared out public notices of potential blackouts.\n\nJohn Holden, 70, moved into his rebuilt home the day after Christmas. His home of 32 years burned down two years ago.\n\n\u201cYou have water, you have a flashlight, you don\u2019t keep your freezer stocked up with too much stuff,\u201d he said of his new way of life. \u201cA lot of people get generators, but they\u2019re noisy and people don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nHolden, who grew up in Southern California, said he doesn\u2019t understand PG&E\u2019s decision.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing much left here to burn, so I don\u2019t know why they would turn this off anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably be okay.\u201d\n\nSchmaltz, the winemaker, said his family pays as much as $350 a month for electricity in their single-family home in nearby Cloverdale.\n\n\u201cMost of the country, I would imagine, would be outraged at those kind of electricity rates, and then to be dealing with [these outages] on top of it,\u201d he said. We live in \u201cone of the nicest places in the world, we have some of the highest rents in the world, having to live out of boxes every once in a while, it\u2019s kind of a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nOver at Bella Vineyards and Wine Caves, Schmaltz sent employees home for a day last week because there was no running water \u2014 they didn\u2019t yet have a second generator to power a pump in the well. A neighbor lent him one.\n\nAfter the fires broke out, however, the neighbor lost power as well.\n\n\u201cCome grab your generator,\u201d Schmaltz told him.\n\nOn Saturday, Healdsburg was evacuated because of the fires, and he again sent the team home.\n\n\u201cThe winery is shutting down,\u201d he texted.", "description": "From wineries to hardware stories, to newly rebuilt neighborhoods recovering from a devastating wildfire in 2017, blackouts are redefining a swatch of California.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eSlIRtJNfwxHTDXk3xAkiitwDUY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T7WX55HXWII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
