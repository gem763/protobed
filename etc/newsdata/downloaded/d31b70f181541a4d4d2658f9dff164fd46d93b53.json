They saw Ukrainian allegations in 2016 about Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort as part of a drive to undermine Trump\u2019s bid for the White House and then reverse the election result through what Trump keeps insisting is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d of \u201cendless investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUkraine is a chip on Trump\u2019s shoulder. So when he saw an opportunity to turn the tables and use Ukraine against former vice president Joe Biden, his leading potential Democratic rival in 2020, he grabbed it. As the narrative shows, he bent the tools of office to his personal political purpose.\n\nBiden deserves some blame, too. Putting aside the false Trump conspiracy theories about him, Biden used poor judgment in playing a roll on Ukraine policy while his son Hunter was working for Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Either the son should have quit, or the father should have shut up. Denying this obvious fact only weakens the Democrats\u2019 case against Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s resentment of Ukraine \u2014 and his disinterest in the country\u2019s fight for freedom against Russia \u2014 appears to begin in 2016, when Ukrainian officials were sharing information about payoffs to Manafort with reporters, Hillary Clinton supporters and FBI officials. (Manafort was eventually convicted of crimes including fraud and money laundering and sentenced to 7\u00bd years in prison.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe idea that Manafort\u2019s troubles were a Ukrainian-Democratic plot surfaced in a January 2017 piece in Politico, which quoted Andrii Telizhenko, a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, complaining that \u201cthe embassy worked very closely\u201d to provide information about Manafort to a Clinton supporter. More than two years later, in May 2019, Telizhenko would meet with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, as he was accelerating his efforts to gather dirt about Biden and other Democrats. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you a thing about the meeting,\u201d a hush-hush Giuliani told The Post in a May 24 article.\n\nTrump cared little about Ukraine\u2019s battle against Russian proxy forces. But he softened when then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko visited the White House on June 20, 2017, and offered to buy what became $80 million in Pennsylvania coal.\n\nThe coal purchase rang a political bell for Trump. In July 2017, he announced the appointment of Kurt Volker, an experienced diplomat, as special representative on Ukraine. Volker began meeting quietly with Vladislav Surkov, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s emissary, to hammer out a deal to stabilize eastern Ukraine. Backed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Volker also pressed Trump to sell Javelin antitank missiles and other weapons to Ukraine to gain leverage in the talks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVolker met with Surkov four times, in Minsk, Belgrade and a final session on Dubai in January 2018. By the last meeting, the two diplomats explored an agreement for deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in eastern Ukraine, local elections, an amnesty plan and a pathway to eventual stability, according to a State Department official. Surkov said he would send a paper outlining Russian views on this formula, but he never did. The back channel proved a dead end.\n\nThe Trump administration had decided in December 2017 to sell 210 Javelin antitank missiles to Ukraine, at Mattis\u2019s urging. For Trump, it was more a matter of marketing U.S. weapons abroad than taking a firm stand against Russia, say several former U.S. officials.\n\nBy 2018, the White House had become obsessed with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference. \u201cTrump had a deeply negative image of Ukraine. \u2018They\u2019re all corrupt, and they tried to take me down,\u2019 \u201d recalls the former State Department official.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSensing the political resentment, Poroschenko apparently decided to remove an irritant. A May 2018 article in the New York Times reported that Ukraine had halted its investigation of Manafort and its cooperation with Mueller.\n\nAfter the Mueller investigation finally concluded with the released report in April, Trump and Giuliani saw Ukraine as a place to settle political scores \u2014 and perhaps damage Biden. The pliant Poroschenko had been replaced by President Volodymyr Zelensky, elected that month. A new influence game began.\n\nTrump\u2019s leverage on the Ukranians was the military package, which had grown to $391 million. As Zelensky struggled to form his government in spring and early summer, he was counting on that aid.\n\nAD\n\nBut in July, just as Zelensky was beginning his outreach to Washington, military deliveries were halted. When Volker and others questioned the holdup at an interagency meeting July 18, no explanation was given, but it soon became clear the order came from the White House. Volker protested to his colleagues: \u201cWe have to keep this aid moving, This is important for our negotiating position with Russia,\u201d the State Department official recounts. But the stall continued.\n\nAD\n\nTrump wanted something very personal and political before he would offer congratulations to Zelensky and unfreeze the military aid. Hoping to break the logjam, Volker had breakfast on July 19 with Giuliani and later texted him to introduce Andrey Yermak, a close Zelensky adviser, according to records released Thursday by House investigators.\n\nThat same day, Volker texted two senior U.S. officials: Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and William Taylor, the charge running the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. Based on what he\u2019d heard from Giuliani, Volker explained what the White House wanted in the upcoming telephone call between Trump and Zelensky. \u201cMost impt [important] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVolker warned Giuliani that the allegations about Biden were based on an unreliable informant, according to the State Department official. What\u2019s astonishing is that Giuliani responded, \u201cYes, I know that,\u201d said this source. But the call \u2014 and the plan to impugn the former vice president \u2014 went forward anyway.\n\nAD\n\nVolker offered instructions to Yermak, the Ukrainian adviser, on July 25, the day of the call with Trump. Volker texted: \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z [Zelensky] convinces trump he will investigate/ \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nThe proposed transaction became explicit later that day, when Trump telephoned Zelensky. Despite all Trump\u2019s fluff about how the call was \u201cperfect,\u201d it was a naked power play. According to the rough transcript released by the White House, Zelensky said, \u201cWe are almost ready to buy more Javelins\u201d and Trump responded immediately: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d With that, Trump meandered through conspiratorial talk about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 campaign, and the \u201cincompetent\u201d Mueller, and \u201cthey say a lot of it started with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd finally, the real plum: Would Zelensky talk to Giuliani about \u201cThe other thing. There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General [William P. Barr] would be great.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Ukrainians thought the call had gone well. But in an Aug. 9 text to Volker, Sondland cautioned: \u201cI think potus really wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians didn\u2019t press Volker about the aid suspension until Aug. 28, when Yermak texted Volker a story from Politico about the cutoff. The squeeze tightened when Trump canceled a trip to Warsaw where he would have met Zelensky on Sept. 1. Was there an implied deal here, U.S. diplomats wondered.\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s how Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Kiev, put it in a Sept. 1 text to Volker and Sondland: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d To which Sondland responded obliquely: \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nTaylor warned Sondland in a Sept. 9 text: \u201cThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario.\u201d The military aid was finally released in mid-September.\n\nAD\n\nThe Ukraine story, like everything about that country, has a gnarled, murky past. But this one isn\u2019t complicated, really. The facts \u2014 what people said and did, in confirmed reports \u2014 are clear. The president linked support for an embattled ally to what he called \u201ca favor\u201d that would help him attack political opponents. If this behavior is acceptable, there really are no rules left.\n\nTwitter: @IgnatiusPost\n\nRead more from David Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Ignatius: This isn\u2019t just another spat.
