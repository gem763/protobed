It\u2019s easy to forget that many of them, particularly hair-care items, contain dangerous, flammable ingredients, despite warning signs printed on the labels. Unfortunately, a teenager in St. Peters, Missouri, got a hard lesson in the dangers of aerosol when her favorite dry shampoo exploded inside her Honda and blew a hole through its roof. Even worse, it was her brand-new car!\n\nChristine Bader Debrecht told the Washington Post that her 19-year-old daughter had just bought the car \u2014 her very first \u2014 in June and that keeping beauty products in the vehicle was a common practice for the teen. \u201cMy daughter has been constantly on the go since she got her driver\u2019s license three years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has always kept a stash of beauty products with her in her car, and dry shampoo has been among them.\u201d Who amongst us?\n\nThe explosion, which was caused by an overheated can of dry shampoo made by Equate, a generic Walmart brand, resulted in a hole in the car\u2019s sunroof and the hinges blown off the middle console. While the Post reports that the temperature outside was around 90 degrees, it was more than likely much hotter inside the vehicle. (A warning label on the can states that the product should be stored below 120 degrees.)\n\nAnother interesting thing about the incident was that a second can of dry shampoo was inside the vehicle, from Dove, but it did not explode. Michelle Francl, a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College, told the Post she was shocked to see propane and butane on the ingredients list of the Equate can. \u201cAt least if you are transporting butane or a propane tank, you know it\u2019s dangerous and can take special safety precautions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was a seemingly innocent can of dry shampoo.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s a bummer that this poor girl has to now deal with expensive damages, her family is grateful that she wasn\u2019t in the vehicle when it happened. It\u2019s also an eye-opener to anyone who tends to leave the occasional beauty product in the car.\n\n\u201cI would not have wanted to be in the car when that happened,\u201d Francl said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a small explosive device.\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
