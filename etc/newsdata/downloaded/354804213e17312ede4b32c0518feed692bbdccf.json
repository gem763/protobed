In March, the Steelers traded the four-time Pro Bowl receiver to Oakland, which released him before he played in a game. New England gave Brown another chance, but it did not last long; the team cut him last week after one game.\n\nDays after the Patriots signed him, a former trainer filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing Brown of rape. The team also learned he tried to intimidate a second woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations.\n\nThe exiled Brown took to Twitter on Sunday, saying he will not be playing in the NFL anymore.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antonio Brown is going back to school.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/patriots_brown_football_41964_c0-15-1676-992_s1770x1032.jpg?caf9e64096c56e65414e5e408149ad7b789db461", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
