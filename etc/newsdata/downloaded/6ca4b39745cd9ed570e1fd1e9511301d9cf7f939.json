In The Anatomy of Influence, a summation released in 2011, Bloom called himself an Epicurean who acknowledged no higher power other than art, living for \"moments raised in quality by aesthetic appreciation.\"\n\nBloom's legacy\n\nHis greatest legacy could well outlive his own name: the title of his breakthrough book, The Anxiety of Influence.\n\nBloom argued that creativity was not a grateful bow to the past, but a Freudian wrestle in which artists denied and distorted their literary ancestors while producing work that revealed an unmistakable debt.\n\nHe was referring to poetry in his 1973 publication, but \"anxiety of influence\" has come to mean how artists of any kind respond to their inspirations. Bloom's theory has been endlessly debated, parodied and challenged, including by Bloom.\n\nThe book's title has entered the culture in ways Bloom likely never imagined or desired, such as the New York Times headline that read \"Jay-Z Confronts the Anxiety of Being Influential\" or the Canadian rock band that named itself Anxiety of Influence.\n\nHis early life\n\nThe youngest of five children, he was born in 1930 in New York's East Bronx to Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Russia, neither of whom ever learned to read English. Bloom's literary journey began with Yiddish poetry, but he soon discovered the works of Hart Crane, T.S. Eliot, William Blake and other poets. He would allege that as a young man he could absorb 1,000 pages at a time.\n\n\"The sense of freedom they conferred,\" he wrote of his favourite books, \"liberated me into a primal exuberance.\"\n\nHe graduated in 1951 from Cornell University, where he studied under the celebrated critic M.H. Abrams, and lived abroad as a Fulbright Scholar at Pembroke College, Cambridge. After earning his doctorate degree from Yale in 1955, he joined the school's English faculty. Bloom married Jeanne Gould in 1958 and had two sons.\n\nCritiquing western culture and literature\n\nBloom openly acknowledged his own heroes, among them Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson and the 19th century critic Walter Pater. He honoured no boundaries between the life of the mind and life itself and absorbed the printed word to the point of fashioning himself after a favourite literary character, Shakespeare's betrayed but life-affirming Falstaff.\n\nBloom's affinity began at age 12, when Falstaff rescued him from \"debilitating self-consciousness,\" and he more than lived up to his hero's oversized aura in person.\n\nIn the 1950s, he opposed the rigid classicism of Eliot. But over the following decades, Bloom condemned Afrocentrism, feminism, Marxism and other movements he placed in the \"School of Resentment.\"\n\nHe disliked the Harry Potter books and slam poetry and was angered by Stephen King's receiving an honorary National Book Award. He dismissed the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature to Doris Lessing, author of the feminist classic The Golden Notebook, as \"pure political correctness\"\n\n\"I am your true Marxist critic,\" he once wrote, \"following Groucho rather than Karl, and take as my motto Groucho's grand admonition, 'Whatever it is, I'm against it.'\"\n\nIn The Western Canon, published in 1994, Bloom named the 26 crucial writers in Western literature, from Dante to Samuel Beckett, and declared Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo among the contemporary greats. Shakespeare reigned at the canon's centre, the inventor of our modern, self-conscious selves, a patriarch so mighty that Freud, Tolstoy and other latter-day masters nearly drove themselves mad rejecting him.\n\nEleanor Wachtel's 1995 conversation with Harold Bloom about his book The Western Canon. 47:44\n\nIn The Book of J, released in 1990, Bloom stated that some parts of the Bible were written by a woman. (He often praised the God of the Old Testament as one of the greatest fictional characters). He admired Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen, George Eliot and Emily Dickinson and the hundreds of critical editions he edited include works on Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Amy Tan.\n\nHis resistance to popular culture was emphatic, but not absolute. He was fond of the rock group The Band and fascinated by the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart and other televangelists.\n\nHe even confessed to watching MTV, telling The Paris Review in 1990 that \"what is going on there, not just in the lyrics but in its whole ambience, is the real vision of what the country needs and desires. It's the image of reality that it sees, and it's quite weird and wonderful.\"\n\nWith files from CBC Books.", "description": "Bloom wrote more than 20 books and prided himself on making scholarly topics accessible to the general reader.
