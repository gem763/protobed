But someone had to do it.", "language": "en", "text": "Recently, however, Trump\u2019s lack of focus has gotten so bad that it has become dangerous to human life, as the Kurds of northeastern Syria can attest. Trump agreed not to stand in the way of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s invasion plans to get the unpleasant Erdogan off the phone, according to an NBC News report. Erdogan later threw Trump\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d letter in the trash and is now demanding the right for Turkey to obtain nuclear weapons.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump sent Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara to straighten things out, but all they came away with was a \u201ccease-fire\u201d agreement that amounted to total capitulation by the Kurds. But how could they possibly have done more? Erdogan knows that Pence and Pompeo don\u2019t speak for the president. Nobody speaks for this president, except perhaps Rudy Giuliani. Any promise can be taken back, any commitment abrogated or red line erased by the next flurry of tweets.\n\nEnter Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is not the president, obviously, but increasingly is acting almost like a prime minister.\n\nOver the weekend, she led a congressional delegation on an unannounced trip to reassure U.S. allies in Jordan and Afghanistan. Given that Pelosi greenlighted the House investigation that likely will end in Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 and, thus, that Trump sees her as his nemesis \u2014 the president likely considered the speaker\u2019s trip a slap in the face.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut somebody had to do it. Somebody had to tell leaders who have thrown in their lot with the United States that Washington hasn\u2019t forgotten its friends or forsaken its responsibilities. That was the message of Pelosi\u2019s trip, aimed not just at leaders in Amman and Kabul but at allies around the world who wonder whether the United States is still worthy of their trust.\n\nIn an administration that operates like a television reality show, Pelosi\u2019s trip was effective counterprogramming. For Trump, this may be the most unsettling development of all: He\u2019s not the only one in town who knows how to steal the spotlight with a well-timed surprise.\n\nWith Pelosi\u2019s dressing-down of Trump at last Wednesday\u2019s White House meeting, her weekend trip abroad and her highly visible oversight of the impeachment process in the House, a first-time visitor to the capital might conclude that she is shaping events while Trump just thrashes around.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president doesn\u2019t even seem to remember why he made the Syria decision that has so many people angry with him. First he said the U.S. troops he ordered to step out of Erdogan\u2019s way would be coming home. The Defense Department then said the troops would instead be shifted to Iraq. Now, Trump is reportedly leaning toward a plan that would involve leaving some of the troops in Syria \u2014 which makes this whole shameful episode more tragic. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds are brutally being driven from their homes in a rampage of ethnic cleansing. For nothing.\n\nTrump seems shaken by the fact that so many Republicans have joined Democrats in denouncing his Syria withdrawal, or redeployment, or whatever it turns out to be. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chimed in Sunday with an op-ed in The Post.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a U.S. pullback and the escalating Turkish-Kurdish hostilities is creating a strategic nightmare for our country,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cEven if the five-day cease-fire announced Thursday holds, events of the past week have set back the United States\u2019 campaign against the Islamic State and other terrorists.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is noteworthy that McConnell is making plans for a serious, extended impeachment trial. He\u2019s not ready to break with Trump, though, and he won\u2019t make his office a competing power center. Only Pelosi is prepared to do that.\n\nWhile she was on her overseas trip, Pelosi\u2019s brother, former Baltimore mayor Thomas D\u2019Alesandro III, died at 90. She called him \u201cthe finest public servant I have ever known.\u201d Then she went back to serving the public.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "It\u2019s good that the speaker is acting almost like a prime minister.", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson", "Columnist Focusing On Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UGj7MWDHu9qyY-SXfNpaFSzLKw0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I44G3YHUIMI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
