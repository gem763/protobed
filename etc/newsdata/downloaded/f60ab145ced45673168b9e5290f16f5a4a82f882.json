Scientists are still trying to work out how someone so incredibly talented can be so utterly lovely.\"\n\nThe second series of Fleabag aired on the BBC earlier this year and has been released by Amazon in the US.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Bandersnatch writers Annabel Jones and Charlie Brooker\n\nOther British winners include Ben Whishaw, who won best supporting actor in a limited series for his role in BBC One's A Very English Scandal.

The interactive Bandersnatch allowed viewers to choose the way the film's storyline unfolded.\n\nIn his speech, Brooker thanked his two children, joking: \"I can never limit your video game screen time again, if I do I'm a disgusting hypocrite [because] it sometimes pays off.\"\n\nBritish writer Jesse Armstrong, whose work on HBO's Succession won him best writing for a drama series, made reference to the strong UK showing at the ceremony.\n\n\"Quite a lot of British winners, maybe too many? Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions,\" he joked.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Peter Dinklage was the only Game of Thrones actor to win on Sunday, for playing Tyrion Lannister\n\nAnother Brit, TV host John Oliver, won outstanding variety talk series for Last Week Tonight.
