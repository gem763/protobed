The officer, who was conscious, was taken to a hospital, and police arrested two people at the scene.\n\nEarlier, demonstrators hurled objects onto the track at another subway station, and police said they had to fire tear gas. Television videos showed police detaining people inside a shopping center and a fire burning near a Chinese bank\u2019s ATMs.\n\nProtesters planned to demonstrate in 18 districts Sunday in an event they called \u201cBlossoms Everywhere\u201d on social media, suggesting the antigovernment movement still has momentum even after this 19th weekend of unrest. Though it appeared to draw fewer protesters than the mass rallies earlier in the year, demonstrators said that reflected new strategies such as holding small protests simultaneously instead of one big rally.\n\nRiot police arrest a demonstrator during a protest event at Hong Kong\u2019s Kwun Tong station on Sunday.

Mrs. Lam could offer measures to address social concerns such as high property prices and a high cost of living. Protesters will also be watching to see if the controversial extradition bill that sparked the protests is officially withdrawn\u2014as the government has pledged\u2014when the legislature reconvenes Wednesday.\n\nIn what could be a veiled threat to Hong Kong\u2019s protesters, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned during a visit to Nepal on Sunday that anyone attempting to split China would be crushed, according to China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency.\n\nThe protests have battered Hong Kong\u2019s economy and threatened its position as a business hub, while complicating President Trump\u2019s negotiations with China over a trade deal. After a meeting with China\u2019s vice premier at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said the protests had \u201ctoned down a lot\u201d and that \u201cgreat progress has been made by China in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nElderly citizens attend a 48-hour sit-in outside the Wan Chai police station.

Some said they hoped the demonstration would show Mr. Trump that the antigovernment movement still has broad support. While many of those marchers were peaceful, some smashed windows at Chinese banks, government buildings and stores considered to be pro-Beijing.\n\nThe extradition bill that prompted the protests could have allowed people accused of crimes to face charges in China\u2019s opaque legal system. But the movement has evolved into a call for a broader democratic overhaul in the semiautonomous Chinese city, an independent inquiry into police conduct and an amnesty for protesters who have been arrested and charged with offenses.\n\nSome protesters say various measures taken by the authorities have reduced attendance in recent weeks. Subway service has been suspended or reduced by train operator MTR Corp., and the government earlier this month invoked an emergency law to ban masks at public gatherings.\n\nIn the Causeway Bay shopping district on Sunday, one of the locations planned for a protest, only a few dozen people attended before some moved to other areas. One protester in her 50s, who declined to be named, said many of her friends are now more likely to stay home even though they still support the protests.\n\nProtesters smash the signage of a Huawei telecom showroom during a flash-mob rally inside a shopping mall in Hong Kong\u2019s Sha Tin district on Sunday.

A masked male protester in a shopping center in the Tai Koo district said many protesters were arrested the previous week due to violence, making some protesters rethink violence as a strategy.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to be more peaceful than last week,\u201d he said, noting that protesters are targeting specific stores and trying to reduce unnecessary vandalism.\n\nJohn Burns, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the coming elections for Hong Kong\u2019s district councils\u2014a layer of government below the legislature\u2014could help reduce tensions in the city as protesters realize that the vote is another appropriate strategy for trying to rein in the government.\n\nAn antigovernment protester carries bamboo sticks for a barricade during a protest in Hong Kong\u2019s Tseung Kwan O district on Sunday.

So the peaceful protesters\u2014and I count myself among those\u2014are still very upset that the government refuses to accept accountability for this fiasco.\u201d\n\nSteve Cheung, 34, who was giving out face masks in Causeway Bay on Sunday, said a victory for the pro-democracy camp in the elections scheduled for later this year might sway the government to offer more concessions to the protesters.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get most of the seats in the elections to give the word to China,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everything goes well, I believe Beijing will actually listen to more of our voice.\u201d\n\n\u2014Natasha Khan contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com and Lucy Craymer at Lucy.Craymer@wsj.com", "description": "Antigovernment protesters built roadblocks, smashed storefronts and clashed with police in multiple locations around the city on Sunday, as demonstrators sought to keep pressure on Hong Kong\u2019s government ahead of a major policy speech by the city\u2019s leader and the reconvening of the legislature.", "authors": ["Mike Cherney", "Lucy Craymer", "Mike.Cherney Wsj.Com", "Lucy.Craymer Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-116479/social", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
