How Instagram started to find food offensive", "language": "en", "text": "I wonder if militant vegans are taking their campaign to demonise some of Britain\u2019s traditional foods to new levels of idiocy on social media.\n\nA fishmonger in west London recently had his Instagram account censored after posting pictures of his wares online. Who would have thought an unadorned halibut or a whole haddock could cause such upset?\n\nSomeone complained about Rex Goldsmith\u2019s snaps of fresh fish, and a warning appeared over a blurred image saying \u201cthis contains sensitive content that many may find offensive or disturbing\u201d. Goldsmith immediately speculated the complaint might have come from a vegan activist. For me, it\u2019s the word \u201cmany\u201d that I find extremely offensive.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nInstagram have now removed the message and apologised, but the Chelsea fishmonger, whose customers include celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, isn\u2019t the only food website to have experienced over-zealous monitoring.\n\nPadella, an excellent pasta restaurant near London\u2019s Borough Market, regularly posts pictures of their new dishes for customers. They were astonished to find a photograph of a dead grouse (which was going to be turned into ragu sauce) was deemed offensive by Instagram, and given a warning caption (which is still online). Images of plucked chickens have also been censored on other sites.\n\nIn a couple of weeks St. John restaurant (the home of nose-to-tail eating) in Smithfield is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a new cookbook (The Book of St John). Foodies travel from all over the world to sample their signature dishes of bone marrow, crispy pigs ears and devilled kidneys. I hope they\u2019ve laid on extra security for party night.", "description": "I wonder if militant vegans are taking their campaign to demonise some of Britain\u2019s traditional foods to new levels of idiocy on social media.\u00a0 A fishmonger in west London\u00a0recently had his Instagram account censored after posting pictures of his wares online.
