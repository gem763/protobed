At that point, she hit the call button to ask for help in her cell. Jail deputies drove her to the hospital more than two hours after she first asked for help, she alleges, at which point they paused for a coffee break at Starbucks.\n\nThe baby died later at the hospital.\n\nREAD: Video shows Colorado woman giving birth alone in a jail cell\n\nAnother woman, Ciera Stoetling, alleges she gave birth in the county jail in May 2018 after she informed staff she was pregnant and told a jail nurse she was having contractions.\n\nThe nurse told her there wasn\u2019t enough staff to take her to the hospital and that she\u2019d have to wait two more days. Her baby later died, but the county\u2019s district attorney\u2019s office concluded in June that the death was natural and there was no wrongdoing on the jail\u2019s part.\n\nStoetling had allegedly been arrested on drug-related allegations and smoked meth while 23 weeks pregnant, the county noted, according to KNBC. (Meth use can result in pregnancy complications, but it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s what contributed to the baby\u2019s death.)\n\nIn the third and most recent instance, an unnamed woman alleged she was denied medical care in late July, resulting in the death of her baby. In a July 30 press release, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department said a 30-year-old woman was transferred to a local hospital for an incident \u201crelated to her pregnancy,\u201d and it was later determined her baby had died at 27 weeks. She had been booked into the jail just days earlier, on July 21, for two misdemeanor warrants, according to the news release.\n\nThe local sheriff\u2019s office denied the allegations in a written statement to the Orange County Register and said that \u201cmany of the allegations in the lawsuit are rooted in a perspective that is anti-incarceration.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office has not yet responded to a VICE News request for comment.\n\nA study of pregnancy in state and federal prisons published in May showed that the nation\u2019s female inmate population has rapidly ballooned, resulting in a possible increase in pregnant, jailed women that often goes unstudied or unreported. Similarly, a federal lawsuit filed in Colorado last month alleged a woman was forced to give birth alone in her Denver County jail cell\n\nHowever, the allegations of the jailed mothers aren\u2019t the only ones lodged against the Orange County jail. Inmates also alleged that privileged calls with their attorneys were monitored and recorded and that they had been denied access to religious services in the original version of the class-action lawsuit filed in April. Some inmates reported being held in solitary confinement or isolation for years.\n\nCover: A sheriff deputy checks on detainees in an isolation unit at the Theo Lacy Facility in Orange, California, on Tuesday, March 14, 2017.
