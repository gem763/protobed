All the skills, like the climbing technique and all the endurance, these are basic for me,\" the 35-year-old Arnold told CNN Sport, from his home in Switzerland, as he reflected on his love of free soloing (climbing without ropes).\n\n\"There are so many very strong climbers around but having these normal climbing skills whilst also having a very clear mind and feeling safe without a rope, that's a bit like a joker [card] or a jackpot.\"\n\nDani Arnold set the speed record for climbing the Cima Grande.\n\nClimbing education\n\nClimbing has always played an important part in Arnold's life. Growing up in the Swiss mountains he would spend his days inadvertently honing his skills because, as he put it, \"there was nothing else to do.\"\n\nAs his skills developed, the challenges intensified as Arnold began to feel increasingly comfortable hanging off the steepest of rock faces, albeit with ropes attached and a support team.\n\nI don't go if I have a bad feeling Dani Arnold\n\nIt was not until he completed his first free solo while ice climbing that he realized the intense thrill that comes with the most dangerous of sports.\n\nFree soloing entered the public's consciousness after American climber Alex Honnold scaled the Californian granite monolith El Capitan without any ropes, an achievement immortalized in a breathtaking BAFTA-winning National Geographic documentary \"Free Solo,\" which won Best Documentary at this year's Oscars.\n\n\"I'm very in the moment,\" Arnold said, explaining how he manages to stay calm when his life is at risk.\n\n\"I know what would happen if I make any mistakes but it's not [...] fear or something like that. I'm just very, very concentrated. I know what I do. So it's not comparable with anything.\"\n\nIt's an answer that gives his family and friends little comfort when he sets off on such perilous adventures and Arnold admits that neither his parents or wife enjoy what he does, though they have come to appreciate why he takes such risks.\n\n\"They realized that this is something very important to me,\" he said. \"They see how many times I train for this stuff [...] I don't go if I have a bad feeling or something like that.\"\n\nArnold has been climbing his entire life, having grown up in the mountains.\n\nRecord breaker\n\nClimbing at speed while free soloing adds an extra layer of peril that pushes Arnold to his absolute limit.\n\nThe natural handgrips and footholds that he uses to pull himself up the rock face are often only a matter of inches but, when you're jumping between them at pace, you lose a certain amount of precision.\n\nBalance between being fast and being safe Dani Arnold\n\n\"[There is] a big balance between being fast and being safe. That's quite a small line, I would say,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the 35-year-old climber, minimizing risk is all about preparation.\n\nBefore setting off on the Cima Grande, Arnold climbed the exact same route (the 1,800 feet Comici-Dimai route) three times and felt mentally prepared for the challenge ahead.\n\nHowever, his record breaking attempt was the first time he climbed the route without safety ropes.\n\n\"I spend 200 days per year somewhere in the mountains, of course not always without ropes, but every day is a bit of preparation and training.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Climbing a 3,000-foot cliff without ropes Replay More Videos ...
