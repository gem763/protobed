Strache denies wrongdoing.\n\nAs suggested by opinion polls for months, Kurz\u2019s People\u2019s Party (OVP) came a comfortable first, with 37.1% of the vote, according to a projection by pollster SORA for national broadcaster ORF based on a count of all but postal ballots.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult four months and now the population has voted us back in,\u201d Kurz told his supporters, without indicating what his coalition preference might be.\n\nKurz said he will initially hold talks with all parties in parliament and has not ruled out any options.\n\nHis two most likely coalition choices are to ally with the FPO again or with the Greens, possibly in a three-way tie-up with the liberal Neos. A centrist coalition with the Social Democrats is mathematically possible but unlikely under their current leadership.\n\nThe SORA projection showed the Social Democrats coming second with 21.7%, their worst result since World War Two but still well ahead of the FPO on 16.1% and the resurgent Greens on a record 14.0%. The projection had a margin of error of 0.7 percentage point.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in Sebastian Kurz\u2019s court now,\u201d the left-wing Greens\u2019 campaign manager Thimo Fiesel told ORF when asked about a coalition with Kurz. \u201cThere is still a majority (for Kurz\u2019s OVP) with the FPO.\u201d\n\nTop candidate of Peoples Party (OeVP) and former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Freedom Party (FPOe) top candidate Norbert Hofer shake hands with Green Party top candidate Werner Kogler as they attend a TV discussion after the announcement of Austria's snap parliamentary election results at the Hofburg palace in Vienna, Austria September 29, 2019. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo\n\nWhile the FPO even issued campaign videos appealing to Kurz to revive their coalition, they were far less keen on Sunday after their share of the vote collapsed by around 10 points compared with the last election in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt is at least very unlikely,\u201d FPO leader Norbert Hofer told ORF when asked if the party would go into government with Kurz, adding that with far fewer votes than two years ago FPO would be seriously weakened in any coalition talks.\n\nLENGTHY TALKS\n\nAustrian voters\u2019 top concern is the environment, surveys show, which helped lift the Greens from less than 4% of the vote in 2017, when they crashed out of parliament.\n\nWhile the Greens could give Kurz a narrow majority, his party is wary of being at the mercy of a handful of its left-wing lawmakers. If he does ally with the Greens he might therefore seek a three-way deal including the liberal, pro-business Neos, who are on 7.8%.\n\nIt could take time for the Greens and Kurz to convince their supporters about working together. Many Greens voters see Kurz as their enemy since he brought the far-right to power. Many of Kurz\u2019s core voters, such as farmers and big business, are wary of the left-wing Greens.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had the impression that Mr Kurz continues to fancy turquoise-blue,\u201d Greens leader Werner Kogler told ORF, referring to an OVP-FPO tie-up. \u201cHe was praising its policies up until yesterday ... We\u2019ll see if they think again.\u201d\n\nKogler has said he is prepared to hold exploratory talks but only if Kurz shows quickly that he is serious.\n\nA tie-up with the Greens would at least spare Kurz the whiff of scandal that could accompany the FPO.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nAsked whom he should work with, Kurz supporter Jutta Hummel, 58, said at his election party: \u201cSurely not the Freedom Party. That was a complete flop before.\u201d\n\nAnother, Paul Widmann, was less keen on the Greens, saying: \u201cThey make politics for people living in cities, not in rural areas where they need a car.\u201d\n\nMany politicians and analysts expect a long period of coalition talks that could leave the current provisional government of civil servants led by former judge Brigitte Bierlein in place until Christmas or later.", "description": "Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz triumphed in Sunday's parliamentary election while the scandal-tainted far right took a beating and the Greens surged, leaving Kurz the option of forming a coalition with either of them.", "authors": ["Francois Murphy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435283529&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0RO", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
