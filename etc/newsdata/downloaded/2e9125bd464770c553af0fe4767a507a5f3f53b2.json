It is a remote place, and a poor one. Its 82 inhabitants live in tiny houses built of mud bricks and corrugated iron. Its open-air church is little more than an arrangement of sticks. Its school is a blackboard tacked to a tree.\n\nFor the newcomer, however, Cabio has a surprise up its sleeve. Though barely reachable by road, the village is a stop on the Benguela Railway, which runs from the port of Lobito in the west all the way to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east. The railway, which fell into disrepair during Angola\u2019s brutal civil war, was reconstructed between 2006 and 2014 by the Chinese, and with it Cabio\u2019s station. Flamingo pink, in the Portuguese style, it could not look more incongruous if it tried.\n\nThanks to its proximity to this railway, Cabio was strategically important during the war, and although there are no soldiers here now, its inhabitants still live with a legacy of those days. Next to the village, on a hill where livestock should be able to graze and children to play, is a minefield laid to protect a former army position (this point was held by the armed wing of the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], the party that now governs the country). It is the size of seven football pitches.\n\nThe mine-clearing women of Angola \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nDuring the worst of the fighting, Cabio was evacuated. When its people returned, no one told them what had happened to their land while they were away. \u201cBut our animals kept dying,\u201d says Jose Palanga, the village chief. \u201cThat was how we knew.\u201d In Angola, a cow can be worth up to $600; to lose one means the difference between a family eating and going hungry. \u201cThe minefield was destroying our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cried out for help. We begged for it.\u201d None came.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the villagers could only be grateful that no human had yet stepped on a mine (anti-personnel mines of the kind buried here detonate easily; all it takes is a child playing with a stick).\n\nBut last January, the Halo Trust, the British landmine charity, set up camp in the village, bringing with it a small army of its own in the form of 18 Angolan women mine clearers. Having since removed 197 mines and 50 items of unexploded ordnance from the area, it hopes to complete the job next month \u2013 at which point the land will be returned to the villagers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Princess Diana walking in one of the safety corridors of the landmine fields of Huambo in 1997 and Prince Harry in Dirico last week. Photograph: Juda Ngwenya/Dominic Lipinski/Reuters\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how happy we\u2019ll be,\u201d says Palanga. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to build. Perhaps more families will come here. Perhaps the village will get bigger.\u201d\n\nThe mine clearers, who live on site for 24 days at a time, are part of 100 Women, a project that aims to empower those involved, as well as to clear mines. So far, 78 have been recruited. Most clear mines, but some work in other capacities: for instance, as cooks. For one in five, this is their first job. Many are single mothers; three-quarters have three or more dependents. The work brings with it a decent salary, and some will tell you happily that it has helped them to buy land, even to build a house.\n\nBut the gains are not only financial. Clearing mines is both extremely dangerous and of immense benefit to Angola, one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. The job brings with it a certain respect.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard they weren\u2019t just recruiting men, I felt it was my duty to show that women could do this, too, by being one of them,\u201d says Maria Niva, who at 19 is one of the youngest women at Cabio (Niva is one of those who met the Duke of Sussex when he visited a \u201ctransformed\u201d Huambo last week, hoping to boost the anti-landmine campaign begun there by his mother, Princess Diana).\n\nWasn\u2019t she frightened? \u201cThe first time I saw an explosion, yes, I was. But you get used to things.\u201d She smiles. \u201cA big change is coming to Angola. It will be safe at last, and that will be amazing.\u201d\n\nHer optimism is infectious. But the task ahead is huge. Angola\u2019s civil war began in 1975. By the time it ended in 2002, more than 500,000 Angolans were dead, millions had been displaced, and its countryside, cities and roads were covered in mines.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maria Niva prepares her equipment before going to work. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nHow many mines are there in Angola? It\u2019s impossible to say. The various factions left no maps. Halo, which has 381 staff here working in 28 operational teams, has so far cleared 100,000 landmines (75 different kinds of devices, manufactured in 22 different countries). In Cuito Cuanavale alone \u2013 the site, between August 1987 and March 1988, of the biggest battle in Africa since the second world war \u2013 it has cleared 35,000 mines. Across Angola, 1,100 known minefields remain, in which there may be up to 500,000 devices.\n\nCould the country, a signatory of the 1997 Ottawa treaty, the convention banning landmines, meet its commitment to being mine-free by 2025? Only if the work, whose estimated cost is \u00a3214m, is fully funded by international donors such as the US and British governments. More money is needed. Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, has said that at the current rate of funding, Angola will not be mine-free until 2046.\n\nThe women at Cabio camp rise at five, put on their boots and uniforms, and line up outside their tents for registration, their faces still morning-soft as they respond to their names (I\u2019ve spent the night in camp with them). Five minutes later, they and their protective gear are in the back of a truck, and moments after this they are by the railway line. Although highly trained \u2013 each one attended a month-long de-mining course \u2013 every shift begins with a demonstration of part of the process: a reminder of the ever-present dangers of the work ahead (these dangers are brought home to me when, before I join them, a note is made of my blood group). An ambulance also waits beside the railway line.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Suzana Soares: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the area we\u2019ve cleared.\u201d Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nAfter this, the sun now almost up, they spread out, each claiming a spot at the edge of land that has already been cleared. A whistle blows: a sign they should get ready to begin. When it sounds for a second time, they fall to their knees, moving their metal detectors over a small rectangle of earth they have first carefully marked out with red cord. If the detector makes no sound, they shuffle forwards, and repeat. Beside them is a bucket of tools: shears for tackling the brush; painted sticks to mark areas that have been cleared. In some places, Halo uses heavy machinery to clear mines. But Cabio\u2019s isolation, and the lie of the land, make that impossible here. The job must be done by hand, inch by inch. It is intense work, and they do it in half-hour segments, a 10-minute break between each one.\n\n\u201cI like blowing the whistle,\u201d says Suzana Soares, with a grin. Soares, who is 28, started as a cook, moved into mine clearing and is now a section commander. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to make sure they\u2019re all safe; that they all take a break. It\u2019s a big job, and I\u2019ve been chosen from among all these girls.\u201d\n\nWhile she\u2019s away, her sister looks after her small daughter. She misses her, and finds this hard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a piece of cake,\u201d she says. But it\u2019s worth it. She is no longer dependent on her parents; she can give her child anything she needs. Like everyone here, her family was affected by the war. Now she has the chance to effect change in her country: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the area we\u2019ve cleared.\u201d\n\nThere is a kind of feminism in the air. Esperan\u00e7a Ngando, who is 24, tells me she was compelled to apply for a job at Halo when the recruiter told her that her work would save people\u2019s lives (she is another of those who met Harry in Huambo \u2013 though when I speak to her the week before his visit, she has no idea who he is). \u201cThose words got to me,\u201d she says. When she realised she would have to live in a tent in the bush for weeks at a time, she cried: she has a husband and three-year-old son. But she likes the life now. She has found solidarity here. \u201cWe\u2019re happy together. It\u2019s a family.\u201d\n\nSome days, the women find nothing. But on the morning of my visit, a mine is discovered \u2013 this makes them all very happy \u2013 and before I leave, it is detonated in a controlled blast. Watching such an explosion, you wonder how anyone who comes unexpectedly into contact with such a device could possibly survive. But survive they do, albeit with horrifying injuries. The 2014 census recorded 88,000 living victims of the explosive remnants of war (the real number is probably higher). Accidents, moreover, continue to happen even in areas that, officially, have been cleared.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manuel Rodriguez with his mother Ermelinda Victoria Jaime.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nIn Huambo, the next stop on my journey, only one uncleared mine field remains, and as a result, the city has grown hugely since Diana\u2019s visit in 1997. Minefield H013, which she crossed in full protective kit, has been fully cleared since 2005, and is now, as her son found out when he walked in her footsteps last week, a busy street, thronged with people and traffic (in 1997, it was still semi-rural). All the same, a month ago, three children from the same family were killed by unexploded ordnance in the city.\n\nTen-year-old Manuel Rodriguez lives in San Antonio, a barrio once close to several of Huambo\u2019s military bases. Three years ago, he and four of his cousins were playing with some stray mangoes on his grandfather\u2019s land when one of them picked something up. In the explosion that followed, one boy, Frederico, died; Manuel and another cousin, Jeremiah, both lost part of their legs. Rescued by soldiers, he spent three weeks in hospital.\n\nWhat was it like when he came home? \u201cIt was difficult at first,\u201d he says, gazing down at his Liverpool shirt (he is a football fan). \u201cI had to learn to use crutches. I used to fall down all the time.\u201d If he is lucky, in the future he will be fitted for a prosthetic leg at Huambo\u2019s orthopaedic centre, a hospital that was last week renamed in memory of Diana. But in Angola, nothing is guaranteed.\n\nOthers have been living with their injuries for decades. Nearby is the home of Luciana Baroso, a mother of eight. Baroso lost her sight in 1994, when she was nine, in an accident that killed her sister, Valentina. The two girls had been to nearby fields to get potatoes for lunch. Her sister hit a mine with a hoe, and it exploded. Somehow, Luciana managed to drag herself to the road; she was taken to hospital by a boy on his bicycle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mother of eight Luciana Baroso, who lost her sight in a landmine explosion when she was nine. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\n\u201cI hoped I would see again,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was discharged, no one told me that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d How did she cope? What effect has the accident had on her life? \u201cThe trauma is still with me,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t do ordinary things.\u201d Tears roll down her face. \u201cI feel it very badly.\u201d In the doorway her mother, Maria, weeps silently.\n\nIt would be easy to feel hopeless, knowing the scale of the work that lies ahead. But everyone agrees that Diana\u2019s visit here was transformational. It boosted funding and led, before the year was over, to the drafting of the Ottawa treaty, later to be signed by 133 countries. All those involved in mine clearance in Angola hope that Harry\u2019s visit will have reminded public and private donors alike that what she campaigned for has not yet been fully achieved. Meanwhile, the Angolan government has recently signed a $60m agreement with Halo that will enable it to clear 135 minefields in the Mavinga and Luengue-Luiana national parks, land that includes the headwaters that feed the Okavango delta, one of Africa\u2019s last wildernesses and home to thousands of threatened species. Harry visited the first minefield to be cleared as part of the project, at Dirico, last Friday.\n\nAbove all, there is the fact that 30 countries have been cleared of mines since 1997. Mozambique, another former Portuguese colony, was declared mine-free in 2015. \u201cThat took 22 years,\u201d says Ralph Legg, Halo\u2019s programme manager in Angola. \u201cEven when the work involved seems overwhelming, there is no excuse. It can be done, and it must be.\u201d", "description": "As Prince Harry visits the country to build on the anti-landmine work begun by his mother, Princess Diana, the Observer joins a group of women while they clear one village of explosives", "authors": ["Rachel Cooke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27700703a6cf54b07a824f865af12f057305f631/0_438_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad0eee53087de9f74ef2b5ec8c6a2170", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
