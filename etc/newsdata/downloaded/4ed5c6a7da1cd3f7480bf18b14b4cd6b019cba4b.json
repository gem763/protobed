Member for Maidenhead thought that she would be having a considerably nicer time when she was next to Lord Buckethead on the evening of the general election, yet here we are.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ladbrokes, the odds are 11/10 for no overall majority, while the chances of a Conservative majority are not far off at 10/11, with 1/6 changes of having the most seats.\n\nThis compares to 16/1 odds of Labour winning more than half of the Commons and a 5/1 chance they will gain the largest number of constituencies.\n\nWhy is Boris Johnson holding a general election anyway?\n\nJohnson hopes an election will finally resolve the Brexit deadlock (Picture: PRU/AFP/Getty)\n\nThe Prime Minister hopes December\u2019s vote will restore the the Conservative majority lost by Theresa May to end the three years deadlock in the Commons over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\n\nHe said yesterday: \u2018We are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse, and to allow us all to submit, as we must in all humility, to the judgement of the electorate\u2014to allow us to make our case and, above all, to allow a new and revitalised Parliament, with a new mandate to deliver on the will of the people and get Brexit done.\n\n\u2018There is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, wilful, fingers-crossed, \u2018not me, guv\u2019 refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people, and that is to refresh this Parliament and give the people a choice.\u2019\n\nAfter the Commons voted against a three-day timetable to railroad his withdrawal deal through Parliament in just three days, Johnson\u2019s pledge to the people to get Brexit done by October 31 \u2018do or die\u2019 was scuppered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking in Parliament yesterday, Ms Phillips said: \u2018This is going to be a Brexit referendum whether we like it or not, except that we will not be being clear and we will not be being honest\u2014none of us will be\u2014and in what we get back we will be able to see whatever we want to see.\n\nWhat will happen to Brexit if there is a hung parliament?\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips says this general election will essentially be a Brexit referendum but not as clear cut (Picture: PA)\n\nThis is probably the question with the least clear answer \u2013 but whatever happens, it is likely to lead to yet more political deadlock.\n\nProgress on the WAB has been abandoned for now as Parliament is expected to dissolve on November 6 to make way for election campaigning.\n\nHaving extended Article 50 until the end of January, the EU has taken no-deal Brexit is now off the table until then at least, whatever happens after December 12.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) received a healthy majority when it was voted for by the Commons last week, so it could still pass if the Tories are the largest party.\n\nBut, as ever in politics, it all depends on the numbers, and a minority government will raise plenty of questions over the mandate for Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ruled out re-negotiation when Theresa May was still in power, but the bloc ended up budging (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe European Union has indicated it is not prepared to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then again, the EU said there wouldn\u2019t budge on Theresa May\u2019s deal, so some wriggle room could be found after the election if Parliament doesn\u2019t get its act together by February.\n\nIf no solution has been reached by then, Parliament might have choose between Johnson\u2019s deal, no deal at all, asking for yet another extension to try and forge another agreement.\n\nAlternatively they could cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 \u2013 which is extremely unlikely unless the Lib Dems come to power \u2013 or hold another referendum, which would require more time in the European Union to organise.\n\nThe bloc still sees a no-deal Brexit as an outcome that will cause serious economic damage for everyone involved.\n\nSo as much as they want to avoid it, they are likely to find a way to extend the UK\u2019s membership \u2013 but this will hang on whether Government asks for it.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
