They began issuing fines, sometimes adding up to hundreds of thousands of dollars on the sanctuary recipients. This had the usual list of suspects up in arms, but it also didn\u2019t seem to produce much in the way of results.\n\nNow, that policy has apparently been rescinded. In a recent announcement, they confirmed that the orders of \u201cNotice of Intention to Fine\u201d had been withdrawn. (Washington Times)\n\nThe government\u2019s deportation agency has canceled the fines of up to $500,000 it had tried to levy on some illegal immigrants who are living in protection in churches, the sanctuary movement said Tuesday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had fired off notices to a number of migrants earlier this year telling them they owed massive fines for defying deportation orders. After an outcry from the migrants, and mocking from immigrant-rights advocates, ICE relented. \u201cFollowing consideration of matters you forwarded for ICE review, and in the exercise of discretion under applicable regulations, ICE hereby withdraws the Notice of Intention to Fine,\u201d the agency said in letters to migrants. That portion of the letter was released publicly by the National Sanctuary Collective.\n\nThere are probably more illegal aliens doing this than you might imagine. The article linked at the top tells the story of Maria Chavalan-Sut, a Guatemalan illegal immigrant who has been holed up in a Methodist church in Virginia for more than a year now. There are plenty of others, like Jose Robles, a Mexican illegal who has been living in a Lutheran church in downtown Seattle for even longer.\n\nDue to traditions and conventions at the agency, ICE doesn\u2019t forcibly remove such individuals from churches where they have been granted sanctuary. And with enough community support and patience on the part of the church, they can last there for a long time.\n\nSo why did ICE decide to back off the policy at this point? They\u2019re not saying, but it\u2019s not too difficult to speculate. While perhaps not the deciding factor, the press, and the Democrats have been having a field day painting the agency as some sort of collection of evil monsters. With the elections drawing closer, perhaps someone determined that the massive fines would probably be yet another PR headache that they didn\u2019t need.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s the question of effectiveness. As I mentioned above, I\u2019ve yet to find a single instance of a person in sanctuary coming out of hiding because they were worried about the fines. Most of the people taking this course of action have tended to stay in the church for a long time. If the strategy isn\u2019t working there isn\u2019t much sense continuing to generate all the paperwork to keep it going.\n\nThe bottom line is that if these individuals don\u2019t qualify for any sort of exemption that would allow them to remain in the country, they\u2019re just compounding their problems. Having spent so much time in violation of a court order to appear at a hearing, they\u2019re unlikely to receive a sympathetic ear from the judge when they finally come out. And the reality is that you can\u2019t stay in the same building indefinitely without eventually going stir crazy. They\u2019ll have to come out sooner or later and all ICE really needs to do is be patient. And as long as they\u2019re staying in the church they aren\u2019t causing any other problems.", "description": "Under deep cover", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/primacy-peter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
