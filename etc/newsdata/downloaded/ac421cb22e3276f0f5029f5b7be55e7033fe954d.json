REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not ask for a Brexit delay at an EU summit next month, but will instead press to secure a deal to smooth Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the prime minister will go to the council meeting on the 17th and 18th (of October), he\u2019ll be trying to strike a deal. He absolutely will not be asking for an extension in that meeting,\u201d Javid told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show.\n\nHe said the bill to force the government to ask for an extension to Brexit talks only has Oct. 19 as a deadline for parliament to either back a deal or leaving without an agreement, and that that was the date the government was watching.\n\n\u201cThe bill talks about the 19th (of October) being an important date and at that point we will consider our options but our policy is clear. It is unchanged, we will be leaving on Oct. 31,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will obey all laws because all governments should obey laws absolutely, but you will have to wait and see what happens then.\u201d", "description": "British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not ask for a Brexit delay at an EU summit next month, but will instead press to secure a deal to smooth Britain's departure from the bloc.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427535847&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870A9", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
