Noire: The Complete Edition\n\n\u2022 Max Payne 3: The Complete Edition\n\nYou\u2019ll also be able to get the Special Edition or Ultimate Edition of the game for a discount and the Outlaw Survival Kit, War Horse, and Treasure Map for story mode.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yeah, Rockstar are very keen that you pre-purchase.\n\nThere\u2019s not much concrete detail on what will be different about the PC version, with the first screenshots not due until 9 October, but Rockstar are promising \u2018a range of graphical and technical enhancements for increased immersion along with new Bounty Hunting Missions, Gang Hideouts, Weapons and more\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s implied that Red Dead Online will be available straight from launch and will include all previously released updates for consoles, including Frontier Pursuits and the specialist Roles of Bounty Hunter, Trader, and Collector.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to buy the game via Rockstar if you don\u2019t want to, as it will also be available via the Epic Games store, Greenman Gaming, the Humble Store, GameStop and \u2018additional digital retailers\u2019 starting October 23rd. There\u2019s no mention of Steam though.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 will also be coming to Stadia when that launches later this week, but perhaps the big question now is whether there\u2019ll be a remastered version \u2013 perhaps based on this new PC edition \u2013 for the upcoming PlayStation 5 and next gen Xbox.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Red Dead Redemption II has sold over 23 million copies \u2013 Take-Two \u2018encouraged\u2019 by Red Dead Online response\n\nMORE: Nintendo Switch was biggest console in US in 2018, Red Dead Redemption II was top game\n\nMORE: Red Dead Redemption II review \u2013 the good, the fantastic, and the beautiful", "description": "The long-awaited PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2 will be out next month, with Rockstar offering free games as a pre-order bonus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ae2b5ef6dc32a8dcb34858339093267f69b76dd8-ea74_1570201619.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
