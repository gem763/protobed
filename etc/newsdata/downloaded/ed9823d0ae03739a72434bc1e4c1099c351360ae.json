(While somehow managing to defy the process of aging.) The John Wick actress is generous with fans and loves to share her tried-and-true tips on Instagram.\n\nHalle's latest message is all about hydration. Naturally she paired her water wisdom with a photo of herself pouring water over her face and wearing a sopping wet t-shirt.\n\nHalle said in the caption: \"Today\u2019s #FitnessFriday is about one of the most important factors of any fitness routine - HYDRATION. We are made of 60% water, and replenishing that amount can have life changing effects on the body - weight loss, higher energy levels, better cardiovascular health, and younger looking skin.\"\n\nHalle's totally on point here\u2014water intake does have an impact on skin. \u201cI\u2019ve found that water makes a big difference in skin health,\u201d Rachel Nazarian, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at the Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City and an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, previously told Women's Health. \u201cWithout adequate water intake, skin appears duller, and wrinkles and pores more prominent.\u201d\n\nHalle continued on in her post, issuing a water challenge to her followers: \"The crazy part? When you\u2019re thirsty, you\u2019re already dehydrated - it\u2019s said that we need upwards of 64 oz. of water a day to stay hydrated and that\u2019s NOT including if we\u2019ve worked out. So I challenge all of us today to drink at least 8 x 8oz. glasses of water a day, EVERYDAY, until next week. Would love to keep track on everyone\u2019s progress, so let me know how it\u2019s going in the comments of this post! LETS DO THIS \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 - Happy Fitness Friday!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFWIW, that eight cups of water daily isn't a universal quota, though. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine actually recommends 11.5 cups per day for women, although hydration needs vary from person to person. The exact amount of H2O you need is dependent on your size and weight. Some of your total water intake comes from foods like fruits and veggies (an apple, for instance, can provide an entire cup of water).\n\nIn general, though, if you take your your weight and divide it by two, that should give you roughly the number of ounces of water you need in a day, Keri Gans, RD, author of The Small Change Diet, previously told Women's Health.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust remember, pouring water down your shirt a la Halle, won't actually help you hydrate though.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Because why not?", "authors": ["Jennifer Nied"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PtvL.f25hZzEt1mnm6ok5g--~B/aD03MTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/2af052b7b6a2b301875d8b52c1cce164", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
