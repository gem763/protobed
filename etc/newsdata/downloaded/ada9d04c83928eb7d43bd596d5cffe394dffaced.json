But he is also keenly focused on tailoring the process to insulate his most vulnerable members from a constituent backlash. The resolution introduced on Thursday was in part an effort to allow Republicans to unite publicly behind a measure critical of the inquiry, a way to show the party base that they were behind Mr. Trump even as they refrained from defending his actions.\n\nMs. Ernst, Ms. McSally, and Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina were among those who have so far publicly supported the measure.\n\nSenator Todd Young of Indiana, the chairman of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, said in a brief interview that the focus on impeachment gives senators \u201can opportunity\u201d to show voters that while they are being \u201cattentive and conscientious to current events, they remain intently focused\u201d on the issues their constituents sent them to work on.\n\nCampaign consultants have stressed to senators the importance of maintaining their own credibility, according to two senior Republican officials, especially given that new revelations may still emerge. They have instructed senators not to respond to every turn of the screw, one reason that most of them have dodged questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct or resorted to complaints about the process.\n\nMr. McConnell, for his part, offered a stilted if telling response on Tuesday, when a reporter asked him as Mr. Taylor testified if he was \u201cwilling to defend the president in this matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to talk about the process in the House,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cI just did. I think it\u2019s grossly unfair and I think the president has a legitimate complaint about the process.\u201d\n\nSome endangered Republicans have also carefully eyed blueprints tested by senators considered to be among the savviest in the conference. Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, have offered one alternative: staking out the position in interviews with local publications that while Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine may have been inappropriate, it is not impeachable.", "description": "Senate Republicans up for re-election in 2020, fearful of straying too far from Mr. Trump yet at pains to defend him, have adopted a strategy of saying as little as possible.", "authors": ["Catie Edmondson", "Emily Cochrane"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/us/politics/24dc-senate/merlin_163134297_250f00ea-216f-457b-8369-1ada441b4ac9-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
