The bullying was tough. There were times when I did not feel like leaving the house because I thought to myself, \u2018What\u2019s the point if I\u2019m going be hassled?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe dancing champion, who started to learn ballroom at the age of nine, urged anyone who is experiencing bullying to \u201chold out\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo those out there trying to make something of their life and who are being bullied or feel they can\u2019t be themselves, my message to them is, it gets better,\u201d Radebe said.\n\n\u201cYou get older, you take charge of who you are and nobody will ever tell you who to be. Just hold out.\u201d\n\nRadebe added that appearing on Strictly Come Dancing has given him courage to be himself.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a country where homosexuality was frowned upon,\u201d Radebe said.\n\n\u201cThe society around me pointed to me and said, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with you,\u2019 but Strictly has helped me be a better person and accepting of myself.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the UK it was beautiful, for the first time in my life I felt liberated.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Radebe and Tyldesley left the competition after losing out to BBC Breakfast\u2019s Mike Bushell in the dance-off.\n\nWhen asked by host Tess Daly about her time on the show, Tyldesley paid tribute to Radebe, calling him her \u201cbest friend\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to work with amazing people and get critiqued off amazing people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, I\u2019m going to keep it up because I fell in love with it! I\u2019ve loved every second, this man has changed my life!\u201d\n\nThis weekend, Radebe will return to Strictly Come Dancing to perform a same-sex routine with fellow professional Graziano di Prima.\n\nSpeaking of the upcoming performance, Radebe said he is \u201cproud\u201d to be a part of what will likely be a defining moment for the show.\n\n\u201cAm I proud to be a part of that? Absolutely,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be a trailblazer. It will be one of the moments where we all sit back and go, \u2018This is what we\u2019ve been waiting for\u2019.\"", "description": "Strictly Come Dancing star Johannes Radebe has opened up about a homophobic attack he experienced as a child while living in South Africa.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/09/johannes-radebe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
