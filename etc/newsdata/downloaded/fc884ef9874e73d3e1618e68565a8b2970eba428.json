Iran maintains its program is peaceful.\n\nIran already has breached the stockpile and enrichment level limits set by the deal, while stressing it could quickly revert back to the terms of the accord if Europe finds a way for it to sell its crude oil abroad despite crushing U.S. sanctions. However, questions likely will grow in Europe over Iran\u2019s intentions as satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press on Saturday showed an once-detained oil tanker Tehran reportedly promised wouldn\u2019t go to Syria was off its coast.\n\nTensions between Iran and the U.S. have risen in recent months, with mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone, and other incidents across the wider Middle East. Iran separately seized another ship and detained 12 Filipino crewmembers, a semi-official news agency reported Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur stockpile is quickly increasing,\u201d Kamalvandi warned in a news conference. \u201cWe hope they will come to their senses.\u201d\n\nThe accord saw Iran limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for sanctions relief. Among the limitations was a requirement that Iran use only 5,060 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges. A centrifuge is a device that enriches uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas.\n\nToday, Iran has begun using an array of 20 IR-6 centrifuges and another 20 of IR-4 centrifuges, Kamalvandi said. An IR-6 can produce enriched uranium 10 times as fast as an IR-1, Iranian officials say, while an IR-4 produces five times as fast.\n\nIran already has increased its enrichment up to 4.5%, above the 3.67% allowed under the deal. Using advanced centrifuges means a shorter time would be needed to push up its enrichment.\n\nKamalvandi said Iran had the ability to go beyond 20% enrichment of uranium. Experts say 20% is just a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% enrichment.\n\nWhile Kamalvandi stressed that \u201cthe Islamic Republic is not after the bomb,\u201d he warned that Iran was running out of ways to stay in the accord.\n\n\u201cIf Europeans want to make any decision, they should do it soon,\u201d he said.\n\nKamalvandi also said Iran would allow U.N. inspectors to continue to monitor sites in the country. A top official from the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency was expected to meet with Iranian officials in Tehran on Sunday.\n\nThe IAEA said Saturday it was aware of Iran\u2019s announcement and \u201cagency inspectors are on the ground in Iran and they will report any relevant activities to IAEA headquarters in Vienna.\u201d\n\nKamalvandi made the remarks in a news conference carried on live television. He spoke from a podium with advanced centrifuges standing next to him.\n\nIn Paris, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Iran\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t a surprise.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians are going to pursue what the Iranians have always intended to pursue,\u201d Esper said at a news conference with his French counterpart, Florence Parly.\n\nMeanwhile Saturday, satellite images showed a once-detained Iranian oil tanker pursued by the U.S. appears to be off the coast of Syria, where Tehran reportedly promised the vessel would not go when authorities in Gibraltar agreed to release it several weeks ago. Iran later seized a British-flagged oil tanker which it still holds.\n\nThe tanker Adrian Darya-1, formerly known as the Grace-1, turned off its Automatic Identification System late Monday, leading to speculation it would be heading to Syria. Other Iranian oil tankers have similarly turned off their tracking beacons in the area, with analysts saying they believe crude oil ends up in Syria in support of embattled President Bashar Assad\u2019s government.\n\nImages obtained by The Associated Press early Saturday from Maxar Technologies appeared to show the vessel off Syria\u2019s coast, some 2 nautical miles (3.7 kilometers) off shore under intermittent cloud cover.\n\nIranian and Syrian officials have not acknowledged the vessel\u2019s presence there. There was no immediate report in Iranian state media about the ship, though authorities earlier said the 2.1 million barrels of crude oil onboard had been sold to an unnamed buyer.\n\nThe oil on board would be worth about $130 million on the global market, but it remains unclear who would buy the oil as they\u2019d face the threat of U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe new images matched a black-and-white image earlier tweeted by John Bolton, the U.S. national security adviser.\n\n\u201cAnyone who said the Adrian Darya-1 wasn\u2019t headed to #Syria is in denial,\u201d Bolton tweeted. \u201cWe can talk, but #Iran\u2019s not getting any sanctions relief until it stops lying and spreading terror!\u201d\n\nU.S. prosecutors in federal court allege the Adrian Darya\u2019s owner is Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On Wednesday, the U.S. imposed new sanctions on an oil shipping network it alleged had ties to the Guard and offered up to $15 million for anyone with information that disrupts its paramilitary operations.\n\nBrian Hook, the U.S. special envoy for Iran, also has reportedly emailed or texted captains of Iranian oil tankers, trying to scare them into not delivering their cargo.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Transportation Department\u2019s Maritime Administration issued on Saturday a new warning to shippers about a potential threat off the coast of Yemen in the southern Red Sea.\n\n\u201cA maritime threat has been reported in the Red Sea in the vicinity of Yemen,\u201d the warning read. \u201cThe nature of the event is potential increased hostilities that threaten maritime security.\u201d\n\nLarge areas of war-torn Yemen are held by the country\u2019s Houthi rebels, which are allied to Iran. Shipping in the Red Sea has been targeted previously by rebel attacks. On Wednesday, a warning went out after two small boats followed one ship in the region, but there\u2019s been no other information about a new threat there.\n\nCmdr. Joshua Frey, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, said the Navy remained ready to maintain the safety of shippers in the region.\n\nSeparately Saturday, the semi-official ISNA news agency said Iran seized a tugboat and its crew of 12 Filipinos near the Strait of Hormuz on suspicion of smuggling diesel fuel. The report did not elaborate. Frey said the U.S. Navy was aware of the report, but declined to comment further.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
