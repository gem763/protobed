Dating back to 1685, only Groot Constantia in Cape Town is older.\n\nBetween the Simonsberg and the Drakenstein mountains, smack-bang in the middle of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, lies a farm-to-table destination for those seeking more than just a quick wine tasting (though, you can also do that).\n\nSnapshot: The Tree House experience for 'free range' kids at Boschendal\n\n(Beautiful Boschendal. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\nStay in the stunning Orchard Cottages, cycle, eat, drink, spa, send the kids to 'farm school' or to play at the Tree House (watch above video), while you take on the green: an afternoon on the lawn with a picnic and a bottle of Boschendal Brut MCC. Or get lost in endless wanders on this historical 'promised land'. The gardens are abundant in bio-dynamic produce.\n\nHome to grass-fed Angus cattle, forest-fed pigs and free range chickens, the farm cooks with nature, not against it. In 2018 The Werf Restaurant won the Woolworths Sustainability Award and placed in South Africa\u2019s Top 30 restaurants at the Eat Out Awards. It prides itself in using local and in season.\n\n(Drakenstein mountains view.

Small plates of tempura waterblommetjies, charcuterie from the on-site butcher, baked camembert and more can now be nibbled on as you sip on award-winning wines.\n\nREAD: From Friday night markets to farm stays: Break away to beautiful-from-every-angle Boschendal\n\n(The Werf, outside seating.

Like a cat in the summer sun, on the opposite side of the main Boschendal strip, you'll find lengthy lawns stretched out in front of the Rhone Homestead. Pop in or book to do a tasting at the Cellar Door Wine Tasting. Shiny and new, it just underwent a refurb. Head inside in winter or chill outside the giant tree in summer.\n\n(Rhode Homestead, also a popular wedding venue. PHOTO: Marisa Crous)\n\n(Time for some MCC.
