Or is it Francois?\n\nOn my phone I discover a contact called Francois Oven. I must have done this deliberately, knowing that if I stored Francois under his actual surname I would forget why I had his phone number. Also, I didn\u2019t know his actual surname. I\u2019m still surprised to find it because I have no memory of putting it there. I had been scrolling through my contacts, more in hope than expectation, looking for the number of someone my wife insisted was called Gervais.\n\nThere remains the problem of how I introduce myself to Francois on the phone after all this time. It\u2019s unlikely he has me listed under Tim Broken Function Selector Switch.\n\nFrancois, it turns out, has a much better memory of our last encounter than I do. He recalls all the technical details of the repair, and only needs me to text him my address as a reminder. Later that afternoon, my wife finds me reading in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cHave you rung Gervais?\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ring Gervais because he\u2019s not called Gervais,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s called Francois Oven.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cA remarkable coincidence, I know,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s coming tomorrow after 11.\u201d\n\nConfronted with skilled tradespersons, I tend to adopt whichever persona \u2013 curious onlooker, bewildered idiot, fellow central heating enthusiast \u2013 best suits the moment. With Francois, I naturally assume the role of apprentice. He seems to expect it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d I say as Francois unscrews the base plate of the hob, \u201cthat it\u2019s the same problem as last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Francois says. \u201cPlease turn off the power at the wall.\u201d\n\nI am right: the function selector switch has burned out. Again.\n\n\u201cThat should not happen,\u201d Francois says.\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d I say. \u201cIt was only 18 months ago that we bought this one!\u201d\n\n\u201cParts are not very well made these days,\u201d he says. The doorbell rings.\n\n\u201cAnd as I recall,\u201d I say, \u201ca new function selector switch isn\u2019t cheap.\u201d\n\nI only sort of recall this.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do,\u201d Francois says. \u201cHand me that screwdriver.\u201d\n\nMy wife is having a loud and unfathomable conversation at the door. It stops suddenly and another door shuts. I leave my station to look down the hall. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThe postman is just using the loo,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s in a hurry.\u201d\n\nI return to Francois, who shows me how to reconfigure the wiring so the switch will operate temporarily. He is patient and methodical, as if I have a forthcoming exam on this very repair. The postman comes out of the loo and into the kitchen.\n\n\u201cYou write for the papers, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I say. How does he know?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen with Brexit?\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, with confidence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cSo this is the neutral wire,\u201d Francois says.\n\nI walk to the door to wave off the postman, but he stops. Under the guise of eliciting my opinion about Brexit, he gives me his. He is articulate and he is furious: with the government, the opposition and anyone who would invoke Britain\u2019s wartime spirit in support of No Deal.\n\n\u201cThe people who fought in that war,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know why we joined the EU!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d I say. Wasn\u2019t he in a hurry?\n\nTim Dowling: there\u2019s a dead bird in my shopping \u2013 is it an omen? Read more\n\nAn hour after the postman finally leaves, the youngest one comes downstairs and peers into the fridge. \u201cThe oven works,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks to Francois Oven.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he the guy who hated Brexit?\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cNo, that was the postman,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cDoes he do that at every house?\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cIt turns out he\u2019s not even our regular postman.\u201d\n\nAn hour later I get a text from the oldest one asking if I want to join that day\u2019s protest outside parliament. I decide to go along, because in these dark times, the hardworking people of the nation need to be represented by those of us who haven\u2019t got much on in the afternoon.", "description": "And here\u2019s the postman, wanting to talk about Brexit\u2026", "authors": ["Tim Dowling"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01618b92e3184be860add84b54e7b4897e22ac46/0_166_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e3d33fa5406193f1d33bb67b3bf0e243", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
