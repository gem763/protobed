Consolidation, they argue, is how they can compete with digital giants as well as cable and satellite companies while still providing local broadcasts.\n\nCable companies, which pay broadcasters to retransmit TV signals to their customers, say the local TV market consolidation raises their costs and harms consumers.\n\nBut broadcasters, who scoff at the notion they have more leverage than giants like AT&T and Comcast, argue the arrangements provide rural Americans with network programming and more local news.\n\nDetails: The FCC\u2019s rules prohibiting broadcasters from owning two top-rated stations in a market aims to protect business competition and diversity of viewpoints.\n\nBut those rules don\u2019t apply to low-power TV stations, which don\u2019t have the geographic reach of a full-power station, or to multicast channels made possible by the shift to digital television.\n\nIn tiny St. Joseph, Missouri, the News-Press & Gazette Company owns the CBS, FOX and NBC affiliates, as well as the local newspaper. The company tried to buy the ABC affiliate, too, before withdrawing its bid at the FCC this month.\n\n\"You\u2019re seeing some stations say, 'We have to have more than one to survive,'\" said David Bradley, CEO of News-Press & Gazette.\n\nWhat they're saying: Critics of the practice say it reduces competition, but broadcasters say it's a choice between having one company providing local broadcast news in a small town, or having none. \"You\u2019re going to really cut the guts out of local journalism if it keeps going without some changes like this,\" Bradley said.\n\nWhat's next: The battle over the future of the media ownership rules will heat up this fall. The Senate Commerce Committee will hear Wednesday from industry officials as it considers reauthorizing legislation allowing satellite companies to import distant broadcast signals, along with other video marketplaces issues.\n\nThe FCC is also seeking comment on updates to its media ownership rules, including whether it should change how it treats low-power stations and multicast channels. The agency noted in 2018 there are \u201cat least several dozen\u201d markets where a single broadcaster has two of the big network affiliates using a multicast channel.\n\nBoth cable industry group NCTA and the American Television Alliance, which represents AT&T, DISH and others, want the FCC to crack down on the practice because it gives broadcasters the ability to blackout prime-time network programming in a market during disputes over retransmission rates.\n\nBut National Association of Broadcasters spokesman Dennis Wharton called it \u201ccomical\u201d to think the arrangements are an unfair competitive threat to cable or satellite companies.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are taking FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to task after his agency approved Gray Television's request to buy the third-rated TV station in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, even though Gray already owns the second-rated station.", "description": "Broadcasters are finding ways to own multiple top outlets in small markets despite rules saying they can't.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/pxWF9-LOK7ONRsaseOFLRNaWM5Y=/0x0:1365x768/1920x1080/2019/10/21/1571692600791.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
