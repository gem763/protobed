It may have taken a hot minute, but Twitch finally began testing a \u201cWatch Parties\u201d feature this week, albeit among a few select streamers.\n\nTwitch streamers like Brandon Nance and Travis Shreffler tweeted screenshots Thursday of emails inviting them to try out the new feature. Now, Twitch has organised events for viewers to binge flicks like Star Wars or Disney movies together in the past, but they were exclusively hosted through the company\u2019s official channel, Twitch Presents. According to these invitations, streamers will be able to host selections from Amazon Prime Video\u2019s library directly on their channels so they can watch and chat with their viewers.\n\nThe amount of times I've ptched this to twitch is... unfathomable. We're here. Finally. IM SO EXCITED. pic.twitter.com/4MtvGcHCXK \u2014 Brandon?

While streaming and watching most content on Twitch is free, users who link their Amazon Prime and Twitch accounts get access to perks like a free channel subscription every month or exclusive emotes. And now, it seems, a seat in its online movie theatre.\n\nOnly a small portion of Prime Video\u2019s full collection of movies and shows are currently available, the invitation continues, such as Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan series, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, and Pok\u00e9mon (which I\u2019m hoping means both the franchise\u2019s movies and shows, but it doesn\u2019t specify. Just... Pok\u00e9mon).\n\nThe company plans to add more offerings eventually, and I\u2019m sure Amazon is chomping at the bit to include some of its original series like Good Omens and The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel among them. Though Prime\u2019s library also has plenty of popular bread-and-butter exclusives too. For example, my mum\u2019s never watched a minute of Twitch in her life, but if channels started hosting Downton Abbey marathons, hell she\u2019d be spamming \u201cF\u201d in chat with the best of them.\n\nNo word yet on when \u201cWatch Parties\u201d will roll out to the masses, though we\u2019ve asked Twitch as much and will update this article with their response. However, you can let Twitch know what Prime Video titles you\u2019d like to see added to the list by emailing [email protected]\n\nWith other rapidly growing platforms like Mixer and Facebook Gaming finally making a dent in Twitch\u2019s stronghold on the streaming industry, Amazon\u2019s smart to fold in as many exclusive features as it can while Twitch continues to outmatch its competitors in cultural clout. Though I\u2019d hate to see what kind of movies our dear president, who joined Twitch earlier this month, might choose to stream. My money\u2019s on The Birth of a Nation.", "description": "Ever since Amazon bought Twitch for a cool $1.42 billion back in 2014, it seemed inevitable that eventually its catalogue of movies and shows would make their way onto the streaming platform for live viewing get-togethers.
