Shares rose 4% in trading before the market opened.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet had expected a profit of $1.83 billion, or $1.11 a share, on $9.59 billion in revenue. Morgan Stanley picked up about 7 cents a share in earnings thanks to a tax benefit; pretax profits were 5% lower than a year ago.\n\nMorgan Stanley is the last of the big U.S. banks to report earnings for the third quarter, a stretch in which two Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts and growing global tensions upended the relative calm and easy financial policies that have helped banks thrive in recent years.\n\nThe results were mixed: Profits rose at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., driven by strong consumer-banking businesses. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. posted lower profits, though the drops at the latter two owed largely to one-time charges.\n\nMorgan Stanley's return on equity, a measure of profitability, was 11.2% for the quarter, versus a range of 9% to 15% at peers that have already reported.\n\nChief Executive James Gorman, in the job since 2010, has transformed Morgan Stanley from Wall Street's problem child into one of its steadier performers. He cut costs, shrank the firm's trading division, and doubled down on wealth management, a steadier business that now accounts for nearly half of Morgan Stanley's revenue and ties up little of its capital.\n\nWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 17, 2019 08:11 ET (12:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
