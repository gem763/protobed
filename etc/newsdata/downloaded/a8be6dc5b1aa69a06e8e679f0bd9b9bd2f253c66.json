But in case the shelf expands beyond that limit, the economic zone can be expanded up to 350 nautical miles with full control of natural resources.\n\nIf the Russian bid is confirmed, the country will gain access to some 5 billion tons of untapped oil and natural gas reserves, worth as much as $30 trillion, according to the estimations of the Ministry of Natural Resources.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Russia, other regional players like Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the US are now actively looking to lay claim in the Arctic due to its rich natural resources and strategic geographical position.\n\nAlso on rt.com US wants Russia to stop being stingy & share its Arctic waters with the world\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
