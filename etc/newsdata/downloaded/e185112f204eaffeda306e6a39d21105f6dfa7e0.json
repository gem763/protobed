Written by Manuel Brug in German broadsheet Die Welt, it described Lewek and her fellow cast members as \"fat women in tight corsets spreading their legs\".\n\nLewek said: \"It was such a derogatory way of describing what my character was all about.\"\n\nWithout naming Brug, she lashed out at \"body-shaming and fat-shaming\" on Twitter, writing: \"Time's up on these juvenile bullies.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @KathrynLewek Why is it necessary to comment on a woman\u2019s body in the same sentence you comment on her high notes? Made the mistake of reading some reviews today (thankfully everyone \u2764\ufe0f\u2019s the production) but seeing comments on my #postpartum #breastfeeding body has me feeling low! \ud83d\ude41 \u2014 KATHRYN LEWEK (@KathrynLewek) August 15, 2019 Report\n\nBrug later responded, writing: \"If she is so sensitive why is she showing herself the whole time in this corset? It is interesting that the thin ladies on stage all had dresses and the not so thin ones have costumes where you see a lot of her weight.\"\n\nHis comments sparked a furious backlash from other singers.\n\n\"This is absolutely disgraceful,\" wrote British tenor Anthony Gregory. \"Why is it 'interesting' that all the 'thin ladies' on stage had dresses? Was that a disappointment? So sorry you're having to put up with it Kathryn.\"\n\n\"Commenting on anything that is unrelated to the performance is irrelevant,\" added Brit Award-winner Camilla Kerslake, noting that \"male singers rarely have to put up with this\".\n\n\"This is [a] representation of how our society and the media have gone way off course in analyzing real beauty and art - and that's devastating,\" said violinist Emily Madonia.\n\nLewek subsequently wrote to the editor of Die Welt imploring the paper to \"set higher standards of quality and decency for your employees\".\n\nIn response, the paper's editor, Dr Ulf Poschardt, said Brug's review had been misinterpreted.\n\n\"This report was not meant as a personal insult - and it is not written as a personal insult,\" he said.\n\n\"What Manuel Brug did attack though, was Barrie Kosky's stage-direction - and his view on woman expressed in this stage-direction. These aesthetics might be called misogynist, not Mr. Brug's clear words about [them].\"\n\n'Not ashamed'\n\nBorn and raised in Connecticut, Lewek has established herself as one of her generation's strongest coloratura sopranos, performing with the The Metropolitan Opera, Opera Leipzig, English National Opera and as a soloist at the BBC Proms.\n\nAlthough she has \"gone up and down in weight over the course of my life\", the singer said the recent reviews were \"the first time I have ever been a target\" of comments about her size.\n\n\"At first I just wanted to ignore it all,\" she said, but changed her mind when other performers, including Deborah Voigt and Jessica Pratt, contacted her to say they had faced similar criticisms.\n\n\"The outpouring of support, and people telling their stories to me made me realise this is something I need to talk about,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not ashamed of how I look, I've got a thick skin, and it felt like an opportunity for me to help my community - because it's unacceptable. It's not good journalism.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Lewek played the Queen of the Night in the Met's production of The Magic Flute six weeks after giving birth\n\nThe response has encouraged her to keep the campaign going, and she plans to speak at a summit of the Parent Artist Advocacy League in New York later this year.\n\nBesides, she said, the Salzburg critics missed a vital point about her post-baby physique.\n\n\"I think I'm singing better than I've ever sung and, honestly, the extra weight I put on when I had my daughter has actually helped,\" she said.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
