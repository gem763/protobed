More than 500 million Chinese watched NBA programming last year, including 21 million who tuned in for the NBA Finals.\n\nEarlier this month Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted in support of the democracy movement in Hong Kong. The Chinese government was enraged by the tweet, leading to friction between China\u2019s authorities and the NBA.\n\nThe topic has become a firestorm in the United States, with many fans upset that the NBA has taken the side of a communist country, possibly because of pressure from Nike, a league sponsor, that generated $6.20 billion from China last year. Comments made by Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James earlier this week in which he took shots at Morey only polarized the issue more, leading to the opinion that this is about the emerging market for the NBA in China.\n\nSilver went on to defend the league\u2019s handling of the entire situation, despite the criticism that they had backed down from supporting Morey\u2019s free speech and caved in to China\u2019s demands.\n\nHe hailed the NBA\u2019s values \u2013 \u201cThese American values\u201d \u2013 as having guided a response that drew national criticism.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cWe made clear that we were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe said there\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u201d", "description": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the league has been hit hard in recent flap with China.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/adam-silver-NBA-commissioner-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
