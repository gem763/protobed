She lost one beloved job, got her hours cut at another, and ended up working odd jobs, including one in human resources at an amusement park.\n\nWith little savings and a low salary, the single mother of three struggled \u2014 even as she watched friends buy million-dollar homes and pricey cars. \u201cI constantly felt like I wasn\u2019t \u2018enough\u2019 and didn\u2019t have \u2018enough,\u2019 \u201d she writes in her new book, \u201cWhy We Left,\u201d which profiles 27 expats in Mexico.\n\nAlso see: How this couple retired to Spain\u2019s gorgeous Andalusia region on $40,000 a year \u2014and you can too\n\nA trip to Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico \u2014 a colorful resort town on the Pacific coast \u2014 changed the course of her life. \u201cI fell in love, I felt this heart connection somehow \u2014 there were beautiful old buildings, cobblestone streets, plazas with wrought iron and the beautiful glittering Pacific Ocean, warm and swimmable,\u201d she tells MarketWatch. \u201cIt just felt deeply healing, friendly and welcoming.\u201d Plus, she saw the interesting cultural, outdoors and foodie offerings of the town and its abundance of English-speaking expats and tourists, and realized that there was almost no information in English about Mazatl\u00e1n\u2019s many goings-on. It sparked an idea: that she could use her journalism experience to create an English-language magazine about Mazatl\u00e1n and its cultural happenings.\n\niStock Panoramic view of the Mazatl\u00e1n shoreline.\n\nAnd so, though the surfing enthusiast initially considered moving to New Orleans, off to Mazatl\u00e1n she went, by herself, in 2006 \u2014 her Toyota Echo packed to the gills. The trip took about four days, and it wasn\u2019t absent self-doubt: She called each of her three children, who by that time were adults, sobbing, wondering if she was making a huge mistake. But she knew that staying in Santa Cruz would leave her scrambling for every dollar, unsure of her future, and she was ready for a new life \u2014 and a new journalistic endeavor. (Plus, she jokes, \u201cI wanted warmer weather and a warmer [expanse of] ocean that I could swim and play in.\u201d)\n\nShe spent the first year in Mazatl\u00e1n living on what she was paid for part-time editing work she did online and some savings (Janet lives on about $1,000 a month), while she explored how to start that local arts-and-entertainment magazine. M! Magazine launched in 2007 \u2014 filled with restaurant reviews, profiles, and advice on what to do and see \u2014 and Janet owned it for nine years.\n\nFast-forward more than a decade \u2014 during which time Janet also started a local organic farmers market \u2014 and, though Janet misses her kids and now three grandkids in the U.S., she reports she \u201ccan\u2019t imagine living in the U.S. again\u201d \u2014 in part because, she says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to live in the States again\u201d and that \u201cthe more easygoing Mexican lifestyle agrees\u201d with her.\n\nAlso see: These Arizona retirees \u2018couldn\u2019t afford\u2019 America \u2014 now they live their dream life on $2,000 a month in Ecuador\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very different vibe here that\u2019s kind of hard to explain. It\u2019s not about being retired, because I wasn\u2019t that until a year ago. It\u2019s just a different understanding of what\u2019s important in life, and a more relaxed, live-and-let-live attitude. If something doesn\u2019t get done today \u2014 there\u2019s always tomorrow, or the next day. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d she explains. Here\u2019s what her life in Mazatl\u00e1n is like, including the costs, residency issues, health care and more.\n\nMatt Mawson Janet Blaser framed by lush surroundings.\n\nCosts: Janet says she lives on about $1,000 a month, with her biggest regular expenses being rent ($210 a month, including water and electricity, for a one-bedroom apartment), gas for her car ($100 to $150 a month) and food (groceries cost her about $250 a month). While produce is cheap, specialty items like fancy cheese or high-end pasta are a bit more than they might be in the U.S., she says. She likes going out to breakfast sometimes and pays about $6, including tip, for that; a fancy dinner might cost $18 or so, she says. She also pays about $22 a month for Wi-Fi for her apartment, and $18 for phone (she uses WhatsApp a lot, which is how we talked), and adds that entertainment is very cheap in the area. You can go to a movie for under $5, for example. She even has a vet who makes house calls ($15) and a bike-repair person who does the same ($10, plus parts).\n\nOne bigger, albeit irregular, expense is travel, as flying to the U.S. is pricey, she says. One hack: You can fly out of Culiac\u00e1n, which is about 220 kilometers north of Mazatl\u00e1n, to Tijuana and then walk across the border, she says.\n\nHealth care: Janet says she spends roughly $1,500 a year on health insurance through an international health-insurance company. Her deductible is $1,000, and she rarely meets that because routine health care in Mexico is inexpensive. She says she\u2019ll spend about $30 on a doctor\u2019s visit and can get appointments the same week and sometimes even the same day; a recent trip to get two dental crowns cost her $135 each. So far, she says she\u2019s had a good experience with the health care in Mexico and highlights the two privately run hospitals in town as a perk.\n\nRead: These retirees ditched their pricey life in Santa Cruz, Calif. \u2014 and now live on a lake in Mexico on $1,750 a month\n\nLanguage hurdles: Though Janet had studied Spanish while living in the U.S., and \u201cthought I knew what I was doing \u2014 that I\u2019ve got this,\u201d she quickly realized upon moving to Mexico that she wasn\u2019t quite as close to fluent as she thought (and even today isn\u2019t perfect). \u201cI can carry on a conversation and make a phone call and order food to go and give directions, but I will never be completely fluent,\u201d she says. The difference between now and then, though, is that \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to try. Even if I sound like a caveman, I\u2019m not afraid \u2014 it\u2019s a constantly humbling position,\u201d she says, adding with a laugh that sometimes she still sounds like \u201ca toddler.\u201d\n\nJanet Blaser Sunset in town\n\nResidency: Janet says the process to secure permanent residency status was relatively easy for her more than a decade ago but notes that is has changed and is more complicated now, though still doable. Here are the details on Mexico residency.\n\nCons of living in Mexico: Janet fully admits that life in Mexico has some significant downsides. \u201cThere are issues in this country,\u201d she writes in her new book. These include \u201cextreme poverty in some parts,\u201d she tells MarketWatch. On a more day-to-day front, Janet laments being unable to find the underwear and organic body products that she likes, and that she finds some store-bought products like kitchen utensils, towels and sheets to be of low quality.\n\nBottom line: \u201cFor all the challenges, I can\u2019t imagine living in the U.S. anymore,\u201d despite the pull of her grandkids and \u201cthe deep comfort of being around my adult children,\u201d Janet writes in her book. \u201cWhen I visit, it doesn\u2019t feel like home anymore; I am indeed a visitor.\u201d And, she tells MarketWatch, \u201cI\u2019m able to actually live a more simple life and be satisfied in a way I could never before in the U.S.\u201d", "description": "After losing her job as a journalist, Janet Blaser left Santa Cruz for Mazatl\u00e1n, where she started her own magazine.
