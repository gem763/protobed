So much better as the last line of defence than last week and a trusty left boot. 8\n\nAnthony Watson A stunning performance, looking so bright down the right. Another who excelled defensively. He has been one of England\u2019s brightest performers throughout the tournament. 9\n\nEngland dethrone New Zealand to reach Rugby World Cup final Read more\n\nManu Tuilagi Unstoppable from that close with early try and got through buckets of defence work thereafter. This is Tuilagi firing on all cylinders. 9\n\nOwen Farrell (capt) A warrior. Played on one leg for most of the match and ended up as England\u2019s joint-top tackler. Hit on Williams typified display. Smile during the haka showed his relish for the occasion. 9\n\nJonny May Flawless under the high ball but did not look himself after hamstring injury last week. Defensively excellent though. 7\n\nGeorge Ford Fully justified his recall. Kicked from hand superbly. Took over goal-kicking duties with a ballsy penalty just before half-time. 9\n\nBen Youngs Ponderous once or twice but has growing into the tournament, improving match by match, which bodes well for the final. 8\n\nMako Vunipola Continues to redefine what loosehead props are capable of. He had 16 carries and made an impact in the scrum. 8\n\nJamie George Shocking throw for Savea\u2019s try but that aside another hugely impressive performance. Brings so much to the side. 8\n\nKyle Sinckler One of a number of England\u2019s big ball-carriers who made some real dents. Hobbled off after another massive shift. 8\n\nMaro Itoje Out of this world. Sacked mauls, disrupted lineouts, gave Smith no peace, hit everything and carried hard. Colossal. 10\n\nCourtney Lawes Jones said that he would throw himself around until Kruis came on and he certainly did that, emptying the tank. 9\n\nTom Curry He is now a live contender for the player of the tournament. Only 21 and should end up with more than 100 caps. 9\n\nSam Underhill Astonishing. Any time New Zealand threatened there was Underill to rock the ball-carrier back from whence he came. 10\n\nBilly Vunipola Much more purposeful with his carrying, especially early on and stuck at it throughout. His best performance of the tournament. 9\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan Dickie (for George 70) 7; Joe Marler (for M Vunipola 70) 6; Dan Cole (for Sinckler 50) Experience was welcome 6; George Kruis (for Lawes 55) Excelled 7; Mark Wilson (for Underhill 70) Huge turnover 7; Willi Heinz (for Youngs 63)7; Henry Slade (for May 45) Showed his class 7; Jonathan Joseph (for Tuilagi 74) n/a\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ardie Savea goes over for New Zealand. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Observer\n\nNew Zealand\n\nBeauden Barrett Never gave up, as demonstrated with his desperate run at the end, but if he beat one defender, there was another waiting. 7\n\nSevu Reece Made Billy Vunipola look silly earlier on and denied Daly a try wonderfully but couldn\u2019t break the shackles. 6\n\nJack Goodhue One of New Zealand\u2019s more forceful runners early on but he faded in the face of such ferocious defence. 6\n\nAnton Lienert-Brown He came into this match as one of the form players of the tournament but it eluded him. Culpable of handling errors. 5\n\nGeorge Bridge Wobbly start with a poor kick after being turned by Ford and did not get better, coming out second-best against Watson. 5\n\nRichie Mo\u2019unga England targeted him and got early joy with Tuilagi\u2019s try. It will be fascinating to see whether he keeps his place in the rebuild. 6\n\nMaro Itoje\u2019s one-man highlights reel puts England on course for greatness | Andy Bull Read more\n\nAaron Smith If England were going to win this match they were going to have to nullify his threat and they did that superbly. 5\n\nJoe Moody Got through plenty of work in defence, producing 13 tackles but could make no impact with ball in hand, carrying once. 6\n\nCodie Taylor New Zealand were supposed to have more joy at the lineout than they did and Coles looked more of a threat when he came on. 5\n\nNepo Laulala Was penalised at the scrum and dispossessed by Ford early on \u2013 and those were the two most notable moments. 5\n\nBrodie Retallick Put Itoje off enough in the lineout that led to Savea\u2019s try. But he has set extremely high standards and didn\u2019t reach them. 6\n\nSam Whitelock He gave away two penalties \u2013 with one, for pushing Farrell in the head, causing Nigel Owens to reverse his initial decision. 5\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n\n\nScott Barrett It was a big selection call and Steve Hansen admitted it did not pay off. Did not contribute enough at the lineout. 5\n\nArdie Savea He was gifted a try and it was just reward as he was the pick of New Zealand\u2019s forwards. The breakdown battle was titanic. 7\n\nKieran Read (capt) He may yet play the bronze medal match but this was, in effect, the disappointing end of a glorious international career. 5\n\nReplacements: Sam Cane (for S Barrett ht) Improved things 6; Dane Coles (for Taylor 50) Lively 7; Jordie Barrett (for Bridge 50) Walloped by Underhill 5; Sonny Bill Williams (for Goodhue 55) Tried his best 5; TJ Perenara (for Smith 55) 6; Angus Ta\u2019avao (for Laulala 55) 6; Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi (for Moody 53) 5; Patrick Tuipulotu (for Whitelock 67) 5", "description": "Maro Itoje was man of the match amid a slew of fine England performances, while the All Blacks struggled to shine", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4029f692675c4d8e85cd6a5894cb23392c55b528/0_126_5225_3136/master/5225.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0619b0dbff3a3a41be47256815f8e124", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
