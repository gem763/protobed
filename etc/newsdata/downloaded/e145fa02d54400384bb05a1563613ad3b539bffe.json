If you thought you saw Zooey Deschanel and Property Brothers star Jonathan Scott kissing in the front row of Monday night\u2019s episode of Dancing With the Stars, it was not just an erotic hallucination brought on by your hyperventilation over Sean Spicer\u2019s Saturday Night Fever dance homage to John Travolta. Your brain might be losing oxygen because of Spicer\u2019s cha-cha too, but according to People, Deschanel and Scott also really share a televised kiss when they were visible on-screen.\n\nThe pair, who reportedly met on the set of James Corden\u2019s Car Pool Karaoke, went public with their new relationship earlier in September, and now they seem to be trying to take it even more public. (It\u2019s not like they kissed in the back row at Dancing With the Stars, you know what we\u2019re saying?) What better way to demonstrate your affection than to literally broadcast it to the entire nation, we say? And really, who could stop themselves? Human nature just tends to take its course whenever Tom Bergeron\u2019s in the room.", "description": "New couple Zooey Deschanel and Property Brothers Jonathan Scott kiss in the front row of Monday\u2019s episode of Dancing With the Stars.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/1-Zooey-Deschanel.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
