It says it is working to reduce the amount of water used in agriculture.\n\nHydrologists consider a country to be facing water scarcity if supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year.\n\nEgypt currently has around 570 cubic metres per person per year, a figure that is expected to drop to 500 cubic metres by 2025, without taking into account any reduction in supply caused by GERD, Egyptian officials said.\n\nEthiopia is expected to start filling the GERD reservoir next year.", "description": "Egypt will push Ethiopia this week to agree to an external mediator to help resolve a deepening dispute over a giant hydropower dam being built on Ethiopia's Blue Nile, officials said on Sunday.\u202e\u202e \u202c\u202c", "authors": ["Aidan Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443089188&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0N7", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
