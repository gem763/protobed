According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Coahuila Attorney General\u2019s Office, a group of state police officers had been patrolling a series of rural roads near the town of Guerrero that lead to the banks of the Rio Grande when the attack took place.\n\nA group of four gunmen came out of the bushes and began firing at the police officers. The officers fought off the attack killing one of the gunmen. The other three gunmen ran away into the brush area. The state police officers called for backup and set up a manhunt to locate the three gunmen but were unable to find them.\n\nThe attack comes at a time when as Breitbart Texas reported, violence has spiked in the neighboring city of Nuevo Laredo where the CDN-Los Zetas have clashed with Tamaulipas State Police officers and military forces leading to several large-scale gun battles.\n\nUnder the leadership of Juan Gerardo \u201cEl Huevo\u201d Trevino Chavez, the CDN-Zetas has been making a series of pushes in an attempt to expand their territories in Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Coahuila. That expansion effort led to a dramatic escalation of violence in northern Mexico.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.
