We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe have a tiny five game slate for the start of the final week.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDIRT CHEAP BARGAINS\n\nClay Buchholz \u2013 SP \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays (vs Orioles)\n\nBy now, we should all be used to Buchholz\u2019s Jekyll and Hyde performance. The 2019 campaign has been a huge bust for the longstanding veteran. He\u2019s not inducing whiffs (5.22 K/9) or preventing runs (6.48 ERA, 5.12 FIP). However, since he\u2019s set to face a weak Orioles offense, he has some modest upside in this tiny slate. He can be expected to deliver a little over five innings with around four strikeouts. Given his miniscule price, there\u2019s upside for top-tier value. Of course, the downside might be ruinous.\n\nJosh Rojas \u2013 OF \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks (vs Adam Wainwright)\n\nJake Lamb \u2013 1B/3B \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks (vs Adam Wainwright)\n\nRojas is a frequent guest of this column. Despite a general failure to deliver much value to date, I\u2019ll continue to bet on his skills \u2013 plenty of hard contact with enough power, speed, and plate discipline to make things happen. Wainwright is one of the tougher matchups in the slate. Since they\u2019re both ground ball guys, Wainwright has the advantage. Rojas is likely to roll over a couple ground balls.\n\nStory continues\n\nLamb matches up better with Wainwright, although I have concerns about his actual talent. He\u2019s in the midst of another miserable season. While he has a history of mashing right-handed pitching, this season he\u2019s produced a meager 62 wRC+ with the platoon advantage (read 38 percent worse than average). Wainwright also has serious platoon issues. This year, lefties are hitting .270/.369/.461 against him with elevated walk and home run rates.\n\nRowdy Tellez \u2013 1B \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays (vs Chandler Shepherd)\n\nShepherd is a minor league-quality pitcher who gives every indication of being hit and homer prone. He allows copious quantities of hard, line drive contact. Tellez has struggled with strikeouts in the majors, but he absolutely annihilated the competition in Triple-A. He has a one-in-four chance for a home run. It\u2019s your best shot for a cheap burst of firepower.\n\nAlso Consider: Lewis Brinson, D.J. Stewart, Wilson Ramos, Austin Dean\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nSteven Matz \u2013 SP \u2013 New York Mets (vs Marlins)\n\nMatz is in the midst of an under-reported breakout. His velocity has climbed throughout the season, and he\u2019s generally delivered strong results in the second half. Sure, there have been occasional setbacks, but that\u2019s true of nearly any pitcher. He\u2019ll face one of the weakest offenses in the league at a top pitcher\u2019s park. Over six innings and six strikeouts with quality run prevention are likely. There\u2019s upside for him to lead the slate.\n\nAlso Consider: Adam Wainwright, J.D. Davis, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Rhys Hoskins, Lourdes Gurriel\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nPete Alonso \u2013 1B \u2013 New York Mets (vs Caleb Smith)\n\nSmith is massively homer prone (1.89 HR/9), and it\u2019s only become more of a problem as the season has progressed. He\u2019s particularly susceptible to right-handed power hitters (2.15 HR/9). For his part, Alonso is an equal opportunity masher. He carries a forty percent chance to hammer a deep fly tonight \u2013 easily tops in the slate. If there\u2019s a downside it\u2019s because he is the most obvious elite hitter.\n\nAlso Consider: Paul Goldschmidt, Juan Soto", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Monday, September 23.
