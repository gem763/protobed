That Apple event came and went without a mention of AirTag or any Tile-like features, but the hints in iOS 13.2 could mean Apple might be ready to unveil its tag hardware and features.\n\nAirTag spotted on the same day as AirPods Pro are announced\n\nApple surprised everyone with AirPods Pro earlier today, after rumors suggested these new noise-canceling headphones would appear at the end of October. Apple could pull a similar surprise for AirTag, or whatever the company is planning to call this device. 9to5Mac notes that the AirTag references in iOS 13.2 simply include placeholder images of AirPods, but that Apple can update these images remotely.\n\nEither way, if Apple does introduce an AirTag accessory then it will clearly be competing directly with Tile. The location tracking company has attempted to embed its technology directly into Bluetooth chips recently, in an effort to move beyond just the tags. Tile has teamed up with Qualcomm, Dialog Semiconductor, Silicon Labs, and Toshiba to include Tile compatibility as an option on future chipsets. Tile has also previously partnered with Boosted and Bose to embed its location tracking network into the companies\u2019 gadgets.", "description": "Apple could be about to announce AirTag, a rumored Tile-like device for tracking things like keys. iOS 13.2 includes references to AirTag, which could mean the device will be available soon", "authors": ["Tom Warren", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4T_cOXSKByy6vwN8c-FcH-1S4A=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11477051/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
