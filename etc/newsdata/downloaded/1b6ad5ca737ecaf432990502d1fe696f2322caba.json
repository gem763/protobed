Our artiste will take any action necessary to protect his children and avoid unnecessary impact on them. He will not tolerate anybody or any platform using his children to create false news,\" the statement read.\n\nEEG also urged the public not to be misled by these harmful rumours, and to recognise facts from fiction.\n\n\"Our company and artiste strongly condemns this misconduct and urge the relevant parties to stop, otherwise we will use legal means to pursue the matter,\" it added.\n\n(Photo Source: On CC)", "description": "The actor's camp releases a statement denying rumoured interview with son Lucas", "authors": ["Heidi Hsia"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8HH7h7NWT5ZlFziE54Ny0Q--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ybrand.cinema.com.my/c597246ede4d48fac511628e426554c8", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
