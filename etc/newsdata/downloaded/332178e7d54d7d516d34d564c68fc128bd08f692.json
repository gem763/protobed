REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nVoting ended at 1700 GMT and a first exit poll was expected at 1900 GMT.\n\nThe runoff presidential election pitted Kais Saied, an independent law professor, against Nabil Karoui, a media mogul facing corruption allegations, after they won more votes than any of the other 24 candidates in the first round last month.\n\nPreliminary turnout figures suggested Sunday\u2019s contest had grabbed the public imagination more than either September\u2019s first round vote or a parliamentary election a week ago.\n\nAt 1430 GMT on Sunday, turnout was 39.2% according to the electoral commission. By comparison, on the day of the first round vote it said that turnout at 1400 GMT was 27.8%.\n\nAt a polling station in the working class Ettadamon district of Tunis, a man stood haranguing passersby, urging them to vote against Karoui, until a policeman asked him to quieten down.\n\nInside, Hanan Madouri, a 25-year-old call center worker in a big straw hat, said she was voting for Saied, citing the corruption trial hanging over his opponent. \u201cI want to vote for a correct, serious person,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two candidates offer starkly different options for president: Saied has spent almost nothing on his campaign, has the backing of both leftists and Islamists, and wants Tunisia to adopt an experimental form of direct democracy.\n\nKaroui has courted the poor, showcasing his philanthropy on the television station he owns, but has also appealed to the business elite and to some secular Tunisians worried about Saied\u2019s conservative social views.\n\nKaroui was arrested in August and held pending a verdict in his trial for money laundering and tax evasion before a court released him on Wednesday. He denies the accusations against him.\n\nRelated Coverage Exit poll shows Saied winning Tunisian election: Mosaique FM\n\nBoth candidates present themselves as outsiders taking on an establishment that has failed to improve Tunisia\u2019s economy or arrest a decline in living standards since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy and inspired the \u201cArab spring\u201d.\n\nDissatisfaction with the political elite was evident in both the first round vote and last week\u2019s legislative election, as major parties lost ground, independents did well, and turnout was low.\n\nHIGHER TURNOUT\n\nOpposite the Ettadamon polling station, Othman Dabbousi, 63, sat next to his fruit stand and said he would not vote, preferring a non-democratic system of rule. \u201cThere is a lot of chaos in this country and it needs a strong man,\u201d he said.\n\nNearby, a soldier stood with a hand on her assault rifle watching over the polling station, a reminder of the jihadist attacks that have sporadically shaken Tunisia, threatening its tourism industry and alarming voters.\n\nWhoever wins the presidential race, along with any governing coalition that can be forged in the fragmented parliament, will face the same problems that have bedeviled recent governments: unemployment of 15%, inflation of 6.8% and high public debt.\n\nAn international election monitoring team in Tunisia raised concern on Sunday about the fairness of the vote, however, because of Karoui\u2019s detention during much of the run-up to the election including the first round vote.\n\n\u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d said Les Campbell, joint leader of the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute observer mission in Tunisia.\n\n\u201cThe playing field was disrupted and that was a significant factor in the election,\u201d the electoral monitor said.\n\nAt a polling booth in the upmarket Lac area of northern Tunis where Karoui also voted, 21-year-old student Najwa Salmi said she had traveled from her university in the city of Sousse to vote.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\n\u201cWe want a president who respects his powers... we don\u2019t need one who will bring in his family,\u201d she said, without saying who she would vote for.\n\nShe had not voted in either the first-round of the presidential election or in the parliamentary poll.\n\n\u201cBut today I vote to support a candidate who will be president of all Tunisians and be fair,\u201d she said.", "description": "Tunisians voted for their next president on Sunday in the last round of a series of elections that have tested the young democracy, with citizens rejecting established politicians and a major candidate spending weeks behind bars.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440295068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C067", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
