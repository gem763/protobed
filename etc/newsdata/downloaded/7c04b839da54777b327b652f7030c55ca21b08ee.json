They added that her pleas were ignored.\n\nThe trial of Bulut's ex-husband and suspected killer, Fedai Varan, 43, began yesterday in K\u0131r\u0131kkale in Central Anatolia. He faces life imprisonment if convicted of the murder.\n\nBulut's death in August triggered a debate about femicide across Turkey and drew attention to mounting violence against women in the country.\n\nThe mother-of-one had divorced her husband four years earlier, was stabbed in a cafe in front of her 10-year-old daughter in the central Anatolian city of Kirikkale. She later died in hospital.\n\nEmine Badeg\u00fcl Bulut pictured with her daughter. She was knifed to death by her ex-husband in a cafe in Kirikkale, Turkey on Sunday\n\nHorrifying footage shows a Turkish woman (left in both images) screaming 'I don't want to die' after being stabbed by her ex husband. Her daughter pleaded for her to stay alive\n\nA video of the aftermath of the attack was posted online showing Bulut in the cafe, covered in blood, screaming to her daughter: 'I don't want to die.'\n\nThe tearful girl says: \"Mum, please don't die.\n\nBulut's ex-husband Fedai Varan, 43, faces life imprisonment for \"deliberately killing with monstrous feeling\" if convicted.\n\nHe told police Bulut had insulted him.\n\nHe appeared via video link at the courtroom in Kirikkale, near Ankara where proceedings struggled to get underway due to the huge number of journalists and lawyers trying to watch proceedings.\n\nAccording to the women's rights group We Will Stop Femicide, 121 women were killed in 2011.\n\nIn 2017 that figure was 409, while 440 were killed in 2018.\n\nA total of 354 women were killed in the first nine months of 2019.\n\nExperts say the violence is partly the result of women exercising greater freedoms - not always welcome in conservative sections of Turkish society.\n\nProtestors gather outside the courthouse in Kirikkale to protest outside the first hearing of the husband suspected of killing his 38-year-old wife, Emine Bulut in August\n\nWomen's rights groups gather outside of the Kirikkale courthouse in Central Anatolia. The murder reignited the debate over mounting violence against women in the country\n\nDivorcing or launching criminal complaints against violent partners can also lead to assault and murder in a society where many men still do not see woman as equal.\n\nActivists have criticised the fact that, in some murder cases, Turkish courts have handed down reduced prison sentences for defendants who contend that they were 'provoked.'\n\nWomen's rights groups attended demonstrations outside the courthouse on Wednesday.\n\nTurkey has ratified the Council of Europe's 2011 Istanbul Convention on preventing domestic violence and has relevant laws covering the scourge.\n\nBut activists say the government must be much more proactive in applying the laws and working to protect women.\n\nThey point to a lack of shelters for women in need and underscore the importance of addressing the broader issue of gender inequality in Turkish society.\n\n'There needs to be widespread education. The laws must be applied as necessary by judges, prosecutors and by the police force,' Nuray Cevirmen of the Human Rights Association in Ankara said.\n\nBulut (far left) with her daughter and another relative. In a horrifying video clip posted on social media she can be heard screaming 'I don't want to die'\n\n'Mechanisms to prevent violence against women and the number of refuges must be increased,' she added.\n\nCevirmen criticised suggestions in some court cases that women's actions or clothes had in some way brought on the violence against them.\n\nVaran previously told a court hearing: 'After she insulted me while talking about the custody of our child, I stabbed her with the knife I brought along.'\n\nBulut's name was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter and 'I don't want to die' (#olmekistemiyorum) was widely quoted on social media, with users calling for harsher measures to tackle domestic violence.\n\nOfficials, including Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul, were quick to condemn the murder after the video was published, along with celebrities and football clubs such as Besiktas.\n\n'We expect the murderer to be punished in the most severe manner', tweeted presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin.\n\nThe murder of Bulut (right) sparked a wave of outcry and calls on social media and from Turkish politicians to tackle violence against women\n\nOmer Celik, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party, said after a party meeting at the time that 'we have to shake the earth' to halt violence against women.\n\nThe government said a team of psychologists was caring for the child.\n\nTurkey has struggled to contain rising violence against women.\n\nIn the first six months of 2019, 214 women were killed by men, while 440 women were killed last year, according to the women's rights group We Will Stop Femicide.\n\nThat was up from 409 women in 2017 and 121 in 2011.\n\nWhile the government acknowledges the issue of violence against women, critics say not enough is being done to provide shelters and to address the broader problem of gender inequality which permeates through society.", "description": "The victim of a high-profile murder in Turkey had taken refuge and sought help at a police station just two hours before her ex-husband stabbed and killed her, according to her family's lawyers.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483954-0-image-a-3_1570614082142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
