I mean, TikTok is doing well,\" Zuckerberg replied in the leaked audio. He went on to explain that TikTok is the first major Chinese tech company to become a major competitor globally.\n\nRead more: Instagram appears to be working on a new video tool, and it's a clone of the feature that made TikTok so successful\n\n\"TikTok, which is built by this company Beijing ByteDance, is really the first consumer internet product built by one of the Chinese tech giants that is doing quite well around the world,\" said Zuckerberg. He specifically said it was doing well with \"young folks\" in the US and India. \"I think it's past Instagram now in India in terms of scale,\" he said.\n\nIt's not entirely clear exactly what metric Zuckerberg is using to measure its scale, but TikTok's growth in India has been meteoric. In January 2019, 43% of the app's new users were from India, up from 9.5% in January 2018, according to app analytics site Sensortower.\n\nZuckerberg then said that one of Facebook's plans of attack was to launch its TikTok competitor Lasso in markets where TikTok hadn't yet got a foothold, like Mexico.\n\n\"We're trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big,\" said Zuckerberg.\n\nApp analytics site App Annie told Business Insider that in August 2019 TikTok had more than 625 monthly active users worldwide, up 85% from the previous year. The US represented 16 million of those users.\n\nRead more of Mark Zuckerberg's comments from the transcript of the Facebook meeting over at The Verge.", "description": "In leaked audio Zuckerberg said Facebook's plan was to launch its TikTok competitor Lasso in countries where TikTok isn't big yet.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b58ba1f89c8a11d008b4594?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
