Then, it was Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails and the Trump campaign\u2019s attempts to solicit Russia\u2019s help in leaking them -- which became the focus of a two-year investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThis time, Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine into investigating a largely discredited accusation that Biden tried to interfere in a Ukrainian corruption investigation involving a company connected to his son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cI mean, Vice President Biden did a terrible thing,\u201d Trump said on Sunday. \u201cJoe\u2019s got a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s response when asked about Trump\u2019s comment: \u201cTrump did a terrible thing.\u201d\n\nThe episode is a preview of the kind of 2020 campaign the country will face if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nTarnish Rival\n\nIt\u2019s also a clear effort by Trump to brush Biden with scandal and damage him as a potential general-election opponent. While Biden\u2019s lead in Democratic primary polls has shrunk, he still leads on the question of which candidate could beat Trump next fall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing about the Ukraine all through this Russian hoax, the witch hunt that they went through that now turned out to be a zero,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cBut after two years, all through I\u2019ve been hearing the name Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe Ukraine controversy involves two parallel, partisan narratives:\n\nFor Biden and the Democrats, the story is Trump\u2019s repeated solicitation of foreign help to discredit his rivals -- and his obstruction of any efforts to hold him accountable. The Ukraine story is a red herring, they say, nothing more than a debunked conspiracy theory meant to distract from Trump\u2019s own corruption.\n\nWhistle-Blower\n\nFor Trump and the Republicans, Democratic corruption is the story. The intelligence agency whistle-blower who reported Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate Biden must be a deep-state partisan, they say, part of a never-ending effort by Democrats to undermine a duly-elected president.\n\nThe Ukraine story also thrusts Biden\u2019s family back into the spotlight, a particularly sensitive topic for the former vice president.\n\nBiden uses the story of the death of his first wife and daughter in a car accident on the campaign trail to show his familiarity with personal tragedy and with the U.S. health-care system. But the 2015 death of his older son, Beau, was the decisive factor in his decision to skip the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\u201cIf we know one thing about Donald Trump it\u2019s that he\u2019s going to go after what he perceives as the weakness of his opponents,\u201d Senator Chris Coons said as he marched with Biden and other supporters during the Polk County Steak Fry on Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe is more concerned about Joe as an opponent than he is about any other opponent and what I think we\u2019re seeing is his willingness to do virtually anything to try to take a nick out of Joe,\u201d said Coons, who took over Biden\u2019s seat representing Delaware. \u201cThis won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nCampaign Pressure\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on the Biden family come as the former vice president faces increasing pressure from the rest of the Democratic field. He\u2019s seen his commanding lead in national polls slowly erode as Democratic voters get to know some of his rivals. And in the key early caucus state of Iowa, Elizabeth Warren edged ahead of Biden in two recent polls.\n\nWarren, for her part, has rallied to Biden\u2019s defense. \u201cThe way to hold the president accountable is for Congress to begin an impeachment proceeding. Congress hasn\u2019t done that,\u201d she said Friday. \u201cHe can go back to the well on exactly what he did before. And that is invite and profit from foreign interference in our election. It\u2019s time for Congress to step up and begin serious impeachment proceedings against this.\u201d\n\nJuly 25 Call\n\nThe controversy broke open last week after reports that the White House was trying to block intelligence officials from submitting the whistle-blower report to Congress. That report concerned a July 25 phone call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump pressured him to investigate Biden, according to a person familiar with the call.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s an early chapter from what could become a defining story line of the 2020 presidential campaign: President Donald Trump attacking his main Democratic rival even as he faces continued questions about his own discussions with a foreign power to instigate an investigation of Joe Biden.The", "authors": ["Gregory Korte", "Tyler Pager", "Josh Wingrove"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xfmK8Ug1yMY2mzFzuj6D3Q--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/afb0efb5c68663dce1660411a240db9f", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
