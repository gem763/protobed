I can prove it to you. The aide flowed once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually \u2014they were doing better with it we got that information from our folks from the conversation with Mr. Zelensky. And once we were able to establish \u2014 we had the Office of Management and Budget to research and other countries aide to Ukraine \u2014 it turns out they don\u2019t get any lethal aid, but they don\u2019t get a considerable amount of money\u2014 once those two things were cleared the money flowed. There was never any question between the flow of money in the server.\u201d\n\nWallace said, \u201cYou know, Mick you said what you said.\u201d\n\nMulvaney said, \u201cI recognize that I didn\u2019t speak clearly, maybe on Thursday.
