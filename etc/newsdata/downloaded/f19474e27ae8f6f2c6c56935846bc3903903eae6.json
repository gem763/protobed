In the middle of the film\u2019s most notorious scene, the sequence in which Monica Bellucci\u2019s character is brutally raped and assaulted by a sadistic, knife-wielding pimp in a subway underpass, the house lights suddenly came on. Looking around the cinema, you saw other spectators staring at their feet, trying to avert their gaze from the screen. They seemed a little bit ashamed about being there.\n\nSeventeen years on, the scene still has the same repellent power that so upset audiences and critics, provoking mass walkouts when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. You can\u2019t help but wonder why Bellucci and her director Gaspar No\u00e9 want to revisit the film now. Haven\u2019t they made us squirm enough already? Surely, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, showing such a film again is absolutely unconscionable?\n\nIn fact, according to the filmmakers, the reverse is the case. Irreversible is now being presented to audiences as a \u201cfeminist\u201d movie, as its star Bellucci calls it. She has a point. Few other movies in recent times have dealt so frankly with male violence towards women and the psychotic desire to hurt and humiliate them. However what undermines Bellucci\u2019s thesis that Irreversible is a feminist tract at heart, is the sheer fetishistic nature of the violence; the way No\u00e9 dwells on the victims\u2019 suffering. The rape sequence lasts for nine minutes and is done in a single shot. It is bravura filmmaking but that doesn\u2019t make it any the less appalling. Rape sequences in other controversial films such as A Clockwork Orange (1971), Straw Dogs (1971) and Elle (2016) are nothing like as graphic or as prolonged as the agonising sequence shown here at such length.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe reason Irreversible was programmed in the Venice Film Festival this week is that No\u00e9 has re-edited it. In the original cut, the story ran in reverse. The rape, which takes place after a party at which Alex (Bellucci) and her boyfriend Marcus (played by her then-husband Vincent Cassel) have argued, happened close to the beginning. We were then whisked back in time. Now, in the new \u201cstraight cut\u201d, the structure is chronological.\n\nIn telling the story backwards the first time around, No\u00e9 was borrowing the reverse chronology used in Betrayal, Harold Pinter\u2019s 1978 play about infidelity, and in Martin Amis\u2019s 1991 novel, Time\u2019s Arrow. The device was ingenious but alienating. It meant that the film seemed cold and experimental. Its violence was horrific but with a strangely abstract quality. The fact that the subway in which the pimp attacked Bellucci had dark purple walls emphasised the fact that this wasn\u2019t conventional social realism. No\u00e9 was turning modern-day Paris into his vision of hell. The martial drumming heard over the credits (which haven\u2019t been changed in the new version) added to the ominous mood of the storytelling.\n\nPresented clockwise, the film (now six minutes shorter than in 2002) is a far richer and more emotional experience than in the original version, at least in its earlier scenes. The new Irreversible still features the same two horrendous acts of violence. There is not only the rape but the scene a few minutes later, inside the \u201cRectum\u201d gay nightclub, in which Marcus and his straitlaced friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel) are trying to track down Alex\u2019s assailant. The quietly spoken Pierre bashes the face of the man he thinks is responsible with such force that we can see the man\u2019s skull crumbling like papier-mache.\n\nWith these incidents near the start of the 2002 cut, audiences were understandably so shell shocked that they missed the delicacy and lyricism found at the other end of the movie. In the revised cut, we learn early on that Alex is pregnant. We can pay more attention to the intimate, beautifully shot scenes between the naked Cassel and Bellucci in which they smoke, make love and listen to music in their apartment. There are hints of Truffaut\u2019s Jules et Jim (1962) in the playful sequences in which the threesome of Alex, Marcus and Pierre (Alex\u2019s former lover) head off to the fateful party. Alex emerges as a stronger, more complex character. We don\u2019t just see her as a victim but identify with her far more closely because so many extra details about her are revealed.\n\nThe way No\u00e9 described \u2018Irreversible\u2019, it was as if he wanted us to treat it as a public information film. You should watch it to understand (and guard yourself against) the most brutal extremes of male behaviour and the self-defeating nature of revenge\n\nAs in his 2018 film Climax, which also takes place over a single night and which follows a group of dancers behaving in an ever more manic and destructive fashion after someone spikes the sangria with LSD, No\u00e9 is exploring how quickly humans can turn from civilised behaviour to barbarism.\n\nThe shock factor is still here in the new cut. Indeed, there is an extra tension and suspense because we (like Alex herself) have the premonition that something awful will happen. We are also better able to understand why Marcus is so set on revenge.\n\nEven so, some of the rhetoric used by No\u00e9 and Bellucci in Venice to defend and celebrate Irreversible sounded a little glib. For example, the former described the film as \u201ctestosterone-phobic\u201d in its relentlessly dark view of male drives.\n\nBellucci, meanwhile, reminded us that when she first asked No\u00e9 why he chose her for the film, he said he wanted to show how \u201cmen sometimes try to destroy beauty\u201d. At the time she made Irreversible, the Italian actress and fashion model was at the height of her fame. She had starred in Giuseppe Tornatore\u2019s romantic comedy-drama Malena (2000), which had become a worldwide hit. Magazines and fashion houses fawned over her. Instead of celebrating her glamour and fame, No\u00e9 set out (in symbolic fashion at least) to degrade and destroy her. The horrific shot of her crumpled, bloodied body being wheeled into an ambulance is as far removed from the Bellucci who appeared in fashion shoots as it is possible to imagine.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 39 film characters that gave us nightmares Show all 39 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 39 film characters that gave us nightmares 1/39 Asami in Audition (1999) Played by: Eihi Shiina Eihi Shiina The torture sequence at the climax of horror film Audition positions the character of Asami \u2013 a woman whose dark history begins to affect her new relationship with a recent widower \u2013 as one of the scariest characters to come out of the Japanese horror sub-genre. Omega Project 2/39 The Blair Witch in The Blair Witch Project (1999) Played by: Nobody Nobody The Blair Witch is present in every shot of the original found-footage horror film despite the fact she's never once seen on screen. It's very much what you don't see that makes every hair stand on end while watching The Blair Witch Project. Artisan Entertainment 3/39 Candyman in Candyman (1992) Played by: Tony Todd Tony Todd You thought Beetlejuice was the worst thing you could summon by repeating his name three times? Wrong. Graduate student Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) learns this after completing a thesis on urban legends, which leads to her discovery of Candyman, the ghost of an artist and son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century. TriStar Pictures 4/39 Max Cady in Cape Fear (1991) Played by: Robert De Niro Robert De Niro Robert De Niro has played several sociopaths in his career (Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle springs to mind), but his depiction of the unstoppable Max Cady in Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear looms large in the memory \u2013 and somehow surpasses Robert Mitchum's performance in the 1962 original. Universal Pictures 5/39 Chucky in Child's Play (1988) Voiced by: Brad Dourif Brad Dourif Chucky has racked up the film appearances over the past three decades, but the character's first appearance came in Child's Play. The slasher film follows a serial killer named Charles Lee Ray, whose spirit possesses a popular doll. MGM/UA Communications Co. 6/39 The Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang (1968) Played by: Robert Helpmann Robert Helpmann The Child Catcher was created by author Roald Dahl, who co-wrote the big screen adaptation of Victor Fleming's Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang. The character may not have featured in the book, but In the film, he's employed to, rather disturbingly, snatch children off the streets to imprison them. United Artists 7/39 The Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) Played by: Heath Ledger Heath Ledger \"Some men just want to watch the world burn,\" Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred, tells him in Christopher Nolan film The Dark Knight \u2013 and while this was also true of Jack Nicholson's incarnation of the Joker in Tim Burton's Batman (1989), it was Heath Ledger who best conveyed this terrifying aspect of the demented villain. Warner Bros Pictures 8/39 Stephen in Django Unchained (2012) Played by: Samuel L Jackson Samuel L Jackson Stephen, the loyal slave belonging to Leonardo DiCaprio's unhinged Calvin Candie, watches anyone and anything that crosses his master's threshold like a hawk, which is precisely what makes Samuel L Jackson's performance in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained so unsettling. Columbia Pictures[ 9/39 Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist (1973) Played by: Linda Blair Linda Blair Mike Nichols turned down the chance to direct The Exorcist because he thought the material would have been too psychologically distressing for a young girl to act out. William Friedkin has no such problem, and went on to direct Linda Blair in the role of the possessed Regan. Warner Bros 10/39 Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas (1990) Played by: Joe Pesci Joe Pesci \"Funny how?\" Tommy DeVito asks Ray Liotta's aspiring gangster, Henry Hill, after he compliments him on delivering a funny quip in Scorsese classic Goodfellas. What follows is a scene as tense as any cinema's offered, mostly thanks to Pesci's volatile depiction. 11/39 Michael Myers in Halloween (1978) Played by: Nick Castle Nick Castle Also known as \"The Shape\", Michael Myers is Halloween's babysitter-hunting antagonist. Interestingly, his mask was a Captain Kirk one, made from a cast of William Shatner's face and painted white, which is terrifying in itself. Universal Pictures 12/39 Pinhead in Hellraiser (1987) Played by: Doug Bradley Doug Bradley Inspired by Bram Stoker character Dracula, the loquacious Pinhead \u2013 from Clive Barker's Hellraiser series \u2013 is one of the most visually terrifying villains in horror movie history \u2013 and note because he looks like he's walked out of an acupuncture clinic a bit too early. Entertainment Film Distributors 13/39 Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) Played by: Christoph Waltz Christoph Waltz It's the unpredictability with which Christoph Waltz plays Hans Landa \u2013 also known as the Jew Hunter \u2013 that puts every viewer of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds on edge. Universal Pictures 14/39 Pennywise in It (2017) Played by: Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd Pennywise is quite literally the thing of nightmares. Taken from the pages of Stephen King, the It character is an embodiment of the fears of every adult and child who comes across him. Warner Bros Pictures 15/39 Fiona in Kill List (2011) Played by: Emma Fryer Emma Fryer Perhaps a left-field choice, but the Phone Shop star was the perfect choice to play the seemingly unimportant date of one of the central characters in Ben Wheatley's Kill List. The moment in which she excuses herself from the dinner table to etch a symbol on the back of Neil Maskell's bathroom mirror is the first hint that nothing in this film is what it seems. Optimum Releasing 16/39 Norman Stansfield in Leon (1994) Played by: Gary Oldman Gary Oldman Gaumont Buena Vista International 17/39 Annie Wilkes in Misery (1990) Played by: Kathy Bates Kathy Bates If you're a famous figure, Misery's Annie Wilkes is one fan you don't want to have. She's so obsessive she's willing to go to extreme lengths to keep you under her care, which makes for some pretty harrowing \u2013 and, in Bates's case: Oscar-winning \u2013 scenes. Columbia Pictures 18/39 Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) Played by: Louise Fletcher Louise Fletcher Fletcher won an Oscar for her role of Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. She's not your stereotypical villain, but her cold, heartless, and passive-aggressive personality chills to the bone. United Artists 19/39 Reverend Harry Powell in Night of the Hunter (1955) Played by: Robert Mitchum Robert Mitchum Mitchum's performance was way ahead of its time \u2013 in 1955, this film about a religious fanatic who kills sexually-active women left viewers ashen-faced and, thanks to the actor's performance, it still packs a punch today. United Artists 20/39 Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) Played by: Robert Englund Robert Englund Just because Freddy Krueger's stripy jumper and clawed hand is so iconic doesn't mean he's any less terrifying. With the character, Wes Craven created a horror figure for the ages. New Line Cinema 21/39 Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men (2007) Played by: Javier Bardem Javier Bardem Anton Chigurh in the Coen brothers's No Country for Old Men could be the scariest villain that doesn't feature in a horror film. It really feels like there's no escape from the Terminator-style hitman, who'll stop at nothing until the job is done. Miramax Films 22/39 Captain Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth (2006) Played by: Forget all the fantastical creatures featured in Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, it's ruthless fascist Captain Vidal that looms large as the scariest aspect of the film. Warner Bros Pictures 23/39 Toby in Paranormal Activity (2009) Played by: Nobody Nobody Just like with Blair Witch, it's what you don't see that makes the hairs stand on end when watching Paranormal Activity. Later films attempted to explore why this particular demon was haunting the poor couple featured at its heart, but not knowing why is what makes the first film the spookiest of the lot. Paramount Pictures 24/39 Norman Bates in Psycho (1960) Played by: Anthony Perkins Anthony Perkins Psycho may have been parodied to death but there's no denying that Norman Bates smiling at the camera with the skeleton of his mother's face transposed over his own is one of the most chilling final shots in cinema history. Paramount Pictures 25/39 Minnie Castavet in Rosemary's Baby (1968) Played by: Ruth Gordon Ruth Gordon For the first few hours of Rosemary's Baby, you find Minnie Castavet irksome. By the end, though, after being revealed as a demon-worshipping witch, she's embedded herself onto a list of people you most certainly wouldn't want as your neighbour. Paramount Pictures 26/39 Sadako Yamamura in Ring (1998) Played by: Rie In\u014d Rie In\u014d The image of Sadako crawling out of the television screen in Ring is as iconic as any the horror genre has offered \u2013 and to this day, remains just as terrifying. Toho 27/39 Billy the Puppet in Saw (2004) Played by: Nobody Nobody If you see Billy emerge from the shadows, you know you're in trouble. The toy was the puppet used by the franchise's Jigsaw killer (Tobin Bell) to communicate to his prisoners what deathly traps they're stuck in. Lionsgate Films 28/39 Don Logan in Sexy Beast (2000) Played by: Ben Kingsley Ben Kingsley Characters don't come as erratic as Don Logan. His violent gangster, who demands Ray Winstone's character take part in a bank job, tears up Sexy Beast like a whirlwind and earned Kingsley an Oscar nomination in the process. Fox Searchlight Pictures 29/39 Amon Goeth in Schindler's List (1993) Played by: Ralph Fiennes Ralph Fiennes Universal Pictures 30/39 Jack Torrance in The Shining (!977) Played by: Jack Nicholson Jack Nicholson Oh, Jack Torrance. For the first half of the film, he's just a guy who's trying to get along and settle down yo write his book. Once he's finally driven mad by the strange goings-on of the Overlook hotel, though, he becomes hell-bent on murdering his wife and kid. That's always going to earn you a place on this list. Warner Bros 31/39 Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) Played by: Anthony Hopkins Anthony Hopkins It's testament to the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins's performance that you almost like Dr Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. We say \"almost\", because there's no forgetting he's a heartless murderer who'll feast on you if he could. if anything, it's his humanity ithat makes him even more unnerving Orion Pictures 32/39 Pyramid Head in Silent Hill (2006) Played by: Roberto Campanella Roberto Campanella Just look at the picture and you'll see why Pyramid Head is on this list. One of the rare characters from the Silent Hill video game that was made even scarier on the big screen. Alliance Atlantis Communications 33/39 Doyle Hargraves in Sling Blade (1996) Played by: Dwight Yoakam Dwight Yoakam Miramax Films 34/39 Leatherface in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Played by: Gunnar Hansen Gunnar Hansen It's he way that Leatherface \u2013 the villain at the heart of 1974 horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre \u2013 flails around, chainsaw in hand, that terrifies the most. There's no method to his madness, but he'll probably catch you anyway.

It is not a documentary. That\u2019s why people like going to see movies about the Titanic or concentration camps. Movies can educate you and prevent you falling in some traps.\u201d\n\nThe way No\u00e9 described Irreversible, it was as if he wanted us to treat it as a public information film. You should watch it to understand (and guard yourself against) the most brutal extremes of male behaviour and the self-defeating nature of revenge.\n\nThese are familiar arguments that have also been made over the years about everything from the eye-gouging scene in King Lear to the bloody excesses of Jacobean revenge tragedy, and the more extreme moments in Sam Peckinpah\u2019s Straw Dogs (1971).\n\n\u201cInside the brain, you have three brains \u2013 the reptilian brain, the mammal brain and the neocortex. That (the neocortex) is the one that allows you to play chess, predict the future and make plans. That\u2019s the rational brain but in the situation of drama and stress, sometimes the reptilian brain dominates the rational brain,\u201d the director told me when I interviewed him last weekend.\n\nThere\u2019s far more of the rational brain in the new cut than its predecessor. With the story told in order, you empathise with the characters. You have time to admire the fluid camera work and the brilliance of the performances. Nonetheless, Irreversible is still a film that hits you hardest in the guts, but is ultimately sickening in its reptilian themes.\n\n\u2018Irreversible \u2013 Straight Cut\u2019 premiered at the Venice Film Festival.
