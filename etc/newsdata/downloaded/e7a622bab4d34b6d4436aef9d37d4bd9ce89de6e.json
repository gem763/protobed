REUTERS/Adriano Machado\n\nThe Chinese vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, was speeding away from Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone towards China on Thursday morning under the escort of at least two other Chinese ships, according to data from Marine Traffic, a website that tracks vessel movements.\n\nChina claims almost all the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea but neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.\n\nTension between Hanoi and Beijing escalated when China sent the vessel to conduct seismic surveys in waters off Vietnam in early July.\n\nThe foreign ministry in Hanoi has repeatedly accused the vessel and its escorts of violating Vietnam\u2019s sovereignty and has demanded that China remove its ships from the area.\n\nThe ministry did not respond immediately to a Reuters email seeking comment on Thursday.\n\nPolice broke up a brief protest in August outside the Chinese embassy in Hanoi over the survey vessel.\n\n\u201cChina doesn\u2019t want any non-ASEAN companies to drill for oil in the South China Sea,\u201d said Ha Hoang Hop, a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nHop also said China only withdrew the vessel shortly after the oilrig Hakuryu-5 completed its drilling at Vietnam\u2019s Block 06.1, which is operated by Russian state oil firm Rosneft ROS.MM.\n\nChinese coastguard ships have also been operating within the oil block since the standoff began, the Marine Traffic data showed.\n\nRosneft did not respond immediately to an email requesting comment.\n\n\u201cChina is determined to pressure Vietnam to end joint oil exploration and production with foreign partners in the area,\u201d said Hop, who is also a visiting senior fellow at the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\nPetroVietnam told Spanish energy firm Repsol last year to halt an offshore oil project under pressure from China, and a unit of Rosneft expressed its concern that its recent drilling could upset China.\n\nVietnamese President and Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong called last week for restraint in the South China Sea, saying Vietnam should \u201cnever compromise\u201d on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nChinese defense minister Wei Fenghe said on Monday the South China Sea is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. \u201cWe will not allow even an inch of territory that our ancestors have left to us to be taken away,\u201d Wei said.\n\nThe Chinese vessel had been thought to have stopped the surveys when it headed away from Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone in early August to Fiery Cross Reef, a man-made island controlled by China that was built on a disputed South China Sea reef. Vietnam and the Philippines also have competing claims on the reef.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that China will send an oil rig to drill in the area where the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had conducted seismic surveys in Vietnam\u2019s exclusive economic zone,\u201d Hop said.", "description": "A Chinese oil survey vessel that has been embroiled in a tense standoff with Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea left Vietnamese-controlled waters on Thursday after more than three months, marine data showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444373103&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0A9", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
