The American move effectively abandoned the Kurdish fighters who were allied with the U.S. and cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s invasion aimed at crushing them.\n\nAmerica\u2019s abrupt reversal pushed the Kurds to strike a deal with the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, inviting its forces to return to regions of northern Syria it had abandoned at the height of the eight-year-old civil war.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia is committed to ensuring security in the region as it works to mediate between the Syrian government and Turkey.\n\nRussia already announced that it had deployed troops to the flashpoint town of Manbij to keep apart advancing Syrian government and Turkish-led forces.\n\nMoscow will also continue to encourage Syria\u2019s Kurds and government to seek rapprochement following the U.S. withdrawal, Lavrov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.\n\nLavrov also blamed the United States and Western nations for undermining the Syrian state, saying this pushed \u201cthe Kurds toward separatism and confrontation with Arab tribes.\u201d\n\nDuring a visit to Iraq last week, Lavrov met with the leaders of the Kurdish autonomous region and said that Moscow is sympathetic to their need for autonomy.\n\nNow in its eighth day, Turkey\u2019s offensive against Kurdish fighters has increasingly strained relations with its NATO allies.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed he would not accept a cease-fire in northern Syria, despite growing pressure from the U.S. and Europe.\n\nSpeaking to a group of journalists late Tuesday on his return from a trip to Azerbaijan, Erdogan said Turkey would only consider a cease-fire once it had cleared the border region of Kurdish fighters that it considers a threat for links to an insurgency within its own territory.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for us to declare a cease-fire until it is cleared,\u201d the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper quoted Erdogan as saying.\n\nErdogan\u2019s comments came as Washington, which has announced limited sanctions on Turkey, said U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national-security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien are traveling to Ankara on Wednesday to try and negotiate a stop to the fighting in Syria\u2019s northeast. Erdogan said early Wednesday he would not meet with Pence or Pompeo, according to reports from AFP and others.\n\n#BREAKING Erdogan says won't meet Pence, Pompeo on Ankara visit pic.twitter.com/6wZGef3av9 \u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) October 16, 2019\n\nTurkey's president @RTErdogan tells @AlexCrawfordSky he will not speak with the US Vice President about a ceasefire in Syria during his visit - adding that he will only talk to President @realDonaldTrump.\n\n\n\nFollow the latest world news here: https://t.co/l50mLoSc4w pic.twitter.com/o5NjsNzt2r \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen Trump comes here, I will be talking to him,\u201d the Turkish president told Sky News.\n\nTrump had announced on Monday new sanctions to try to pressure Turkey to accept a cease-fire.\n\nBut Erdogan told journalists that he had rejected U.S. offers to mediate.
