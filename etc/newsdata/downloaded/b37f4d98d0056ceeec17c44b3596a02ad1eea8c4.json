Further, 26 percent of Republicans surveyed said they oppose the move and 18 percent said they do not hold an opinion on the matter. The poll surveyed 1,500 people between October 13th-15th and had a margin of error of plus or minus of 2.7 percentage points.\n\nThe survey\u2019s results show Republican lawmakers who oppose the troop pullout \u2013 such as Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) \u2013 are at odds with the majority of GOP voters.\n\nGraham, one of Congress\u2019s most high-profile foreign policy hawks, has argued the president\u2019s decision is a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d and \u201cwill be a stain on America\u2019s honor for abandoning the Kurds.\u201d\n\nConversely, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), known for his non-interventionist approach with respect to foreign policy, has said Graham is flat-out wrong.\n\n\u201cLindsey Graham has been wrong about almost every foreign policy decision of the last two decades,\u201d Paul told MSNBC on Tuesday. \u201cHe was wrong about the Iraq War. The Iraq War was a mistake. It made Iran stronger, allowed more chaos, more instability, and more terrorism. He was wrong about the war in Libya. It leads to more chaos and more terrorism. He is wrong about this.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense has argued that continuing to station troops in the area could put American lives at risk.\n\n\u201cDue to Turkey\u2019s irresponsible actions, the risk to U.S. forces in northeast Syria has reached an unacceptable level. We are also at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict,\u201d said Defense Secretary Mark Esper, before adding that \u201ca small footprint\u201d of troops will stay behind at the Al Tanf garrison in southern Syria. The decision, Esper says, to prevent a re-emergence from ISIS in the area.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday to reporters in the Oval Office, President Trump said any military conflict between Turkey and Syria is between the two Middle Eastern countries.\n\nThey have a problem at the border; it\u2019s not our border,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cIf Syria wants to fight for their land, that\u2019s up to Turkey and Syria,\u201d he added. \u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d", "description": "57 percent of Republicans support President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, according to a newly-released poll.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1168367792-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
