I\u2019ve experienced this in my life so I already know what it feels lie,\u201d added Mowry-Housley, fighting back tears.\n\nShe also revealed she\u2019s currently in therapy. \u201cI\u2019m getting grief therapy, and to move on I just have to compartmentalize my days,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to get to a point that it has to happen to you so that you\u2019re finally sensitive on the subject,\u201d said Mowry-Housley. \u201cI can only speak as a victim of this, but I don\u2019t want my niece to have died in vain,\u201d she added.\n\nMowry-Housley\u2019s 18-year-old niece, Alaina Housley, was one of 12 people killed in 2018 when a gunman opened fire at a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Shortly after the tragedy, Mowry-Housley posted a tribute to her niece on Instagram, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair how you were taken and how soon you were taken from us.\n\nFellow panelist Adrienne Houghton used the conversation to call for tighter gun control and a ban on assault weapons. \u201cThe issue here is assault weapons,\u201d said Houghton. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t need is a machine gun.\u201d\n\nMany viewers took to Twitter to applaud Mowry-Housley for being so open about her grief, and to echo Houghton\u2019s call for gun control:\n\nSo many people feel the same way as you @TameraMowryTwo\n\nStop voting for Republicans! \u2014 Loser Lyds (@Lyds85) September 19, 2019\n\n@TameraMowryTwo Thank you for grieving out loud on @TheRealDaytime - crying, wearing black, sharing the need for grief counseling... Your experience demonstrates who and what #gunviolence leaves behind and the pressing need for #guncontrol. \u2014 Dr. Bisa (@DrBisa) September 19, 2019\n\n@TheRealDaytime my 5 yr old started kindergarden and the only question he asked is what do i do if someone comes in school shooting? Broke my heart. This isnt what a 5 yr old should be thinking starting school. \u2014 Christina monteiro (@Christinamon142) September 19, 2019\n\nOthers heard Houghton\u2019s view on assault weapons and wrote to say they disagree that guns are the issue behind the violence:\n\nWe do not have a gun problem, we have a people problem. We also have a problem with the media glorifying the shooter. They shouldnt even be acknowledged in the story. It should be solely about the victims and who they are. \u2014 Alanna Holcomb (@AlannaHolcomb5) September 18, 2019\n\nHow about condemning the person behind the gun that has no morals instead of blaming the gun. God has been taken out of schools and government, now we have a \u201cGodless Society \u201c just what the liberals wanted! \u2014 Marilyn Keller (@marilynkeller96) September 19, 2019\n\nMeghan McCain defends Sean Spicer:\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "Tamera Mowry-Housley opens up a year after her niece was killed in the Thousand Oaks, Calif., mass shooting.", "authors": ["Todd Garrin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KIxCwlV4XqFNDdFuIQSVRA--~B/aD0xNDg2O3c9MzM0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/94407740-db20-11e9-b1dd-0db41efb7c9f", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
