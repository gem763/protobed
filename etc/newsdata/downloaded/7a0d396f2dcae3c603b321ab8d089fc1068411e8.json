It had some of the same mountains it has today, some of the same valleys and inlets. But it didn\u2019t have the same address.\n\nLong ago, Antarctica was located in the mid-\u00adlatitudes, once part of the super\u00adcontinent Gondwana, until it slowly broke away, leaving continental kin like Africa and South America behind. It then went its own way, carried off by continental drift at just 1 to 2 in. per year, until it wound up where it is today, banished by tectonics to the bottom of the world.\n\nThere, the 5.4 million sq. mi. \u00adcontinent\u2014larger than Australia\u2019s 2.9 million and Europe\u2019s 3.9 million\u2014gets its sunlight only laterally, never vertically, and will thus ever be sunk in a deep freeze, until the same crustal migration carries it to a kinder part of the planet. For now, Antarctica is buried under a layer of ice that averages 7,100 ft. deep\u2014or 1.3 miles. That dense covering represents 90% of all the world\u2019s ice and 70% of its fresh water, locked in a wasteland.\n\nSign up for One.Five, TIME\u2019s climate change newsletter\n\nOnly it\u2019s not a wasteland. Antarctica is home to penguins, seals, visiting whales, gulls, krill, albatross and more. Like all continents, it has its complex food web; like all continents it has its seasons and its landscapes and its peaks and valleys. They aren\u2019t the seasons we might like; it\u2019s not a landscape we could survive. But our species is not the sole measure of a continent\u2019s worth.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, all of that entrained ice is serving us well. In a world in which Antarctica were situated elsewhere, the ice would be water and the oceans would be deeper, inundating what are now our coasts. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered to us if we\u2019d been born into that world. If there had been no Florida in the first place, we never would have built a Miami. But there is, and we did. And now, thanks to our industrial enterprise and our fossil-fuel gluttony, we\u2019re raising the temperature and melting the ice. The Arctic is already vanishing and the Antarctic is following, threatening us with the very inundation the polar ice spares us. The numbers here tell an alarming story\u2014and it\u2019s a story we are every day authoring.\n\nThis is one article in a series on the state of the planet\u2019s response to climate change.
