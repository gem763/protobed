Recounting a trip to Kyiv in late 2015, Biden described telling the then-president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, that he had to fire the prosecutor general or the US would not release $1 billion in loan guarantees. \u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours,\u2019\u201d Biden told the crowd, taking a long look at his watch for effect. \u201c\u2018If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch.\u201d Here the audience laughed. \u201cHe got fired.\u201d\u2026\n\nThree former officials who worked closely with Biden on Ukraine said they knew as soon as they watched the appearance that Biden had not spoken well. \u201cIt was classic Joe Biden,\u201d said one former official\u2026\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s quite possible that he got it over the finish line,\u201d the former official said of Biden. \u201cEverything that a president or vice president does, almost everything has been worked on for months or weeks by dozens if not hundreds of people.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, there was the concern that Biden\u2019s remarks would embarrass the Ukrainian leadership. Poroshenko had a contentious relationship with Biden while the two were in office, the Ukrainian leader finding him too pushy. After Biden\u2019s statements at the Council on Foreign Relations, Poroshenko, still president, was furious, and made calls to former officials to register his displeasure.", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Miriamelder Joe-Biden-Ukraine-Hunter"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
