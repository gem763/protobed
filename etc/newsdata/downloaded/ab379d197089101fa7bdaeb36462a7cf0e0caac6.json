But if the situation becomes so bad, then no option should be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.\u201d\n\nLam said that her visit to Beijing for China\u2019s National Day parade on Oct. 1 had been brief and didn\u2019t include any business meetings with central government officials.\n\nLam condemned protesters\u2019 violence and attacks on businesses, after demonstrators vandalized shops and paralyzed the city\u2019s transit system in some of the worst unrest of the past four months. She said authorities would offer support to industries affected by the movement and called for developers and store owners to provide relief measures.\n\n\u201cThis kind of violence has become limitless and lawless,\u201d she said. The city government \u201cwill use its greatest determination to halt these violent acts,\u201d she said.\n\nStressing the impact to Hong Kong\u2019s economy after four months of pro-democracy protests, she said that visitor arrivals to the Asian financial hub had dropped by more than 50% year on year during the Oct. 1-6 National Day holiday period, when the city is usually packed with tourists.\n\nThe fierce clashes -- and the specter of Beijing deploying its People\u2019s Liberation Army troops in the city -- have drawn condemnation and concern from officials from the U.S., the U.K. and others.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Beijing that trade talks between the two sides could suffer if the country does anything \u201cbad\u201d to try and end protests in Hong Kong. \u201cThey have to do that in a peaceful manner,\u201d he told reporters at the White House.\n\nThe weekend\u2019s unrest followed Lam\u2019s decision to ban protesters from wearing masks under a colonial-era law that could also be used to detain and arrest protesters and censor publications. She didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of further measures under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which was last used more than a half century ago to put down leftist riots.\n\n\u201cWe are faced with such a changing situation,\u201d Lam said. \u201cWhat I can assure you is the government will take a very serious view and very careful assessment before the ERO is to be invoked again.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s subway network shut down over the weekend as radical protesters clashed with police, throwing Molotov cocktails and bricks at police officers and vandalizing banks and train stations. Many businesses shut down, and video footage showed a taxi driver dragged out and beaten by demonstrators after accusations he\u2019d driven into a crowd of protesters.\n\nThe dramatic scenes -- including the shooting of a second protester -- were the latest in four months of anti-China demonstrations opposing since-scrapped extradition legislation that have morphed into the most serious challenge to Beijing\u2019s rule since Hong Kong returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nLam has previously took the blame for the \u201centire unrest,\u201d after withdrawing her ill-fated proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China. Last week, she condemned radical protesters and saying mask ban was required in the face of unending violence.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to say that the anti-mask law is not effective. For any new policy or new legislation, it will take time for it to be effectively implemented,\u201d Lam said Tuesday. \u201cIf a piece of legislation has been enacted, but people refuse to abide by the law, then of course we have a problem at hand.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net;Shawna Kwan in Hong Kong at wkwan35@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said her government could handle growing violence without intervention by Beijing, but didn\u2019t rule out seeking China\u2019s help or invoking further emergency measures.\u201cI still strongly feel that we should find the solution ourselves,\u201d Lam told reporters", "authors": ["Iain Marlow", "Shawna Kwan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZCnxmKapoMnG3MnwjeDJNw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/745b79fbd298fff7ef401ef98fa7f658", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
