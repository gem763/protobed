And the winners are:\n\nTheodore Roosevelt\n\nPresident Roosevelt may have espoused the gospel of \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d but that didn\u2019t stop the Nobel committee from awarding him the peace prize in 1906 for \u201chaving negotiated peace in the Russo-Japanese war.\u201d He was the first head of state to win the prize, and the move was controversial, since Roosevelt had also fought for control of the Philippines. According to the Institute, Swedish newspapers said Alfred Nobel was \u201cturning in his grave.\u201d\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\nBetween 1914 and 1918, i.e. World War I, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded only once, to the International Red Cross. Then in 1919, President Wilson won for being the \u201cleading architect of the League of Nations.\u201d A precursor to the United Nations, the League of Nations was supposed to prevent a world war from happening ever again. Unfortunately, the Senate Republicans blocked the U.S. from joining, and the League ultimately failed.\n\nJimmy Carter (post-presidency)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFormer president Carter won the peace prize in 2002 for \u201chis decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts,\u201d but the committee said he had probably deserved it while he was still in office. In 1978, he mediated a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel known as the Camp David Accords. As an ex-president, Carter also worked for peace in Northern Ireland, North Korea, Uganda, Palestine, to name a few. He called for an end to the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in the U.S., arguing that policies that punish instead of treat drug users are inhumane. And at 95, the longest-living former president in U.S. history is still building homes for the poor with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nBarack Obama\n\nAs the Nobel committee noted, there was a long list of reasons why Carter was Nobel-worthy. The same could not really be said for President Obama in 2009, who won the prize \u201cfor his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\u201d only nine months after taking office. In fact, the nomination window closed 11 days after his inauguration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe award drew criticism from the right and left, and not just because of his brief time on the international stage. As commander in chief, he was also presiding over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan even as he traveled to Oslo to accept the honor.\n\nHours after the news broke, Obama said, \u201cTo be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who've been honored by this prize.\u201d\n\nTrump noted this, too, 10 years later, saying, \u201cThey gave one to Obama immediately after his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it. You know what, that was the only thing I agreed with him on.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump wasn't awarded the coveted peace prize Friday, but four of his predecessors in the White House have won it.", "authors": ["Gillian Brockell", "Staff Writer For Retropolis"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L_JS0vfXadFyse5lkpAaEjyTm40=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YQCQDY4JN5FGZEATN53HDTD6VU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
