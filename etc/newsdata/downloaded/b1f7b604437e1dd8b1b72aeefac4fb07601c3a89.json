So he follows the Netflix special capturing his Broadway show with \"Western Stars,\" a deeply personal film performing songs from his latest album, which also marks his debut as a director.\n\nCo-director, actually, since Springsteen shares those chores with longtime collaborator Thomas Zimny -- with whom he collaborated on \"The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town\" and \"Springsteen on Broadway\" -- in an 80-some-odd minute presentation that weds the music to Springsteen's stage-honed storytelling skills, coupled with gauzy images of him and his wife, Patti Scialfa.\n\nIt is, clearly, a valentine for hardcore \"Bruuuuuce\" fans, but one that does an effective job of both showcasing the material and connecting the songs in a thematic way, supporting an album that Springsteen describes near the outset as a meditation on \"the struggle between individual freedom and communal life.\"\n\nWith its modern-cowboy vibe, some of the ancillary footage looks a bit like an old Marlboro commercial, but the clear desire is to create a cohesive feel that augments the 13 songs -- performed, with a full orchestra, in Springsteen's 100-year-old barn with a minimal number of onlookers.\n\nBruce Springsteen in 'Western Stars'\n\nThe experience is undeniably intimate, even through the medium of film.
