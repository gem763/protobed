The two most frequent problems, according to Dr. Castellano, are an open bite (where the top and bottom front teeth don't touch even when the child is biting down) and a crossbite (where some of the upper teeth bite on the inside of the lower teeth). Dr. Castellano said he sometimes sees an open bite so dramatic that it looks like a pacifier-shaped gap between a child\u2019s front teeth. For this reason, the A.A.P.D. recommends that children try to stop using a pacifier by age 3, he said. If you\u2019re not sure whether your child\u2019s pacifier is affecting his teeth, discuss it with his pediatric dentist.\n\nIf your child is at least 9 months old and is having frequent ear infections, that\u2019s another indicator that it might be time to give up the paci. A 2003 review by the Canadian Paediatric Society found that pacifier use among children ages 3 and under can increase the risk for middle-ear infections. One 1999 study of 200 babies who were 12 months or younger, for example, found that those who used a pacifier for more than five hours per day had a greater chance of ear infections than those who didn\u2019t use a pacifier. The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends that children stop using a pacifier if they have recurring ear infections. If you notice this in your child, ask your pediatrician about it.\n\nIf your child was born prematurely, Dr. Feldman-Winter recommended waiting until at least 12 months after your original due date to wean. Premature babies are at higher risk of SIDS, and evidence suggests that pacifiers can help to protect against it.\n\nSometimes parents are concerned that pacifiers might contribute to speech problems, but there\u2019s no solid body of evidence linking the two, said Diane Paul, Ph.D., a speech-language pathologist at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association in Rockville, Md. Two small studies \u2014 one of about 70 2-to-6.5-year-olds in Arkansas and another of about 200 preschoolers in Australia, published in 2008 and 2018 respectively \u2014 found no difference in speech difficulties between children who used a pacifier and those who did not. One 2009 study of about 130 3-to-5-year-olds in Chile, however, did suggest that children who continued using a pacifier or sucking their fingers past age 3 were more likely to develop speech disorders than those who did not use a pacifier. It found no increased risk, however, for children who had used a pacifier for 3 years or less. \u201cIf there's a link at all, it's for preschool children who've used the pacifier for 3 years or more,\u201d said Dr. Paul, but larger studies are still needed to tease out these differences.\n\nAnother concern parents may have is that a pacifier might disrupt breastfeeding, but if your child is already using a pacifier, this fear isn\u2019t backed by solid science, said Dr. Feldman-Winter. The research on whether pacifiers interfere with successful breastfeeding is mixed and comes from the first few months of life, especially from the time before breastfeeding is fully established. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends waiting to introduce a pacifier until after breastfeeding is well established, Dr. Feldman-Winter said, which means breastfeeding is going well and the baby is gaining weight and is able to latch and feed effectively, without causing any pain in the mother.\n\n[Tips on how to breastfeed during the first two weeks of life.]", "description": "Breaking the habit won\u2019t be fun for anyone.
