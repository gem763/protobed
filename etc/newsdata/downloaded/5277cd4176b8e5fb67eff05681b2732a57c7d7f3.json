The target is related to what the sources described as Tehran\u2019s ability to spread \u201cpropaganda.\u201d The operation was said to be smaller in scale than previous ones that took place during several months of US-Iranian brinkmanship.\n\nWashington has a long record of using its cyber-offensive capabilities against Iran. The most famous example was Operation Olympic Games, which involved infecting industrial controllers at an Iranian uranium enrichment plant with a virus designed to damage centrifuges in ostensibly natural malfunctions. The campaign was conducted under the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and was stopped after the virus, called Stuxnet, got out of control and spread across the internet, where it was identified by cybersecurity experts.\n\nAlso on rt.com Khamenei tells Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards to create its own advanced and modern weapons\n\nThe latest cyberoperation was meant as retaliation for the September 14 drone and missile attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility which the US and its allies blamed on Tehran. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who have been fighting against a Saudi-led military incursion into their country since 2015, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe escalation of tensions between the US and Iran started last year when President Donald Trump broke an international agreement signed by his predecessor and launched a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran. Trump re-imposed economic sanctions which had been lifted in exchange for Iran\u2019s agreement to restrict its nuclear industry, and targeted Iranian oil exports, threatening buyers of Iranian crude with secondary sanctions.\n\nWashington\u2019s public response to the September 14 airstrikes was to deploy additional troops and weapons to the region \u2013 the latest in a series of similar moves this year.\n\nLike this story?
