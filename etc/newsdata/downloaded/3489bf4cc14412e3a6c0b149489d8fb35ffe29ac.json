Harrelson said he had always thought it was more important to focus on serious issues like \u201cthe ice is melting; the Amazon is burning; our water, food and air are polluted.\u201d\n\nThen he stripped off his tux to the \u201cultimate evening wear\u201d pajamas he had on underneath. That seemed to be the chameleon theme of his monologue.\n\nWhen Harrelson mentioned that he didn\u2019t \u201cjust get off the boat,\u201d he seemed embarrassed and stopped himself apologetically. It \u201csounds like I\u2019m slandering immigrants; I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think immigrants make this country great.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut let\u2019s face it, most of \u2019em, they don\u2019t come by boat anymore. I mean they just walk right in. We see that every day on the news. Well, Fox News, anyway,\u201d Harrelson said. \u201cOh geez, if what I just said offended Fox News viewers, I apologize. And if I hurt the one Fox viewer who\u2019s also an immigrant, well I apologize to you, Madam First Lady.\u201d\n\nHarrelson complained about the Chinese \u201ctaking over everything\u201d \u2014 including his whole house. \u201cMy wife\u2019s Asian, my daughters are Asian,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m caucasian.\u201d\n\nCheck out his last joke \u2014 about the word \u201cpussyfoot\u201d \u2014 in the video up top.", "description": "\"I think immigrants make this country great,\" he tells audience.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9058b92100005a00fd5d42.png?cache=ig3r79lu1o&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
