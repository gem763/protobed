Chez ma Cousine, which has four locations in the city, is a glorious exception. Here, the atmosphere is warm, the food hearty, and the prices reasonable, at least for Switzerland. Order the restaurant\u2019s signature dish: half a roast chicken, served alongside a pile of chunky, well-seasoned roasted potatoes and a heap of perfectly dressed salad greens (15.90 francs). It\u2019s best to book ahead for Saturday lunch, although the smallest location, in Old Town, doesn\u2019t take reservations.\n\n7) 2 p.m. Humanitarian history\n\nYou could argue that Geneva arrived on the global stage in 1863, when the Genevois Henry Dunant and four other Swiss men set up what we know today as the Red Cross, an organization whose emblem \u2014 the inverse of the Swiss flag \u2014 has become a universal symbol for medical aid. Explore this history, and the Red Cross\u2019s role in assisting soldiers, prisoners, and endangered people around the world, in the small but engrossing International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum (entry, 15 francs). The museum\u2019s immersive exhibitions explore three pressing humanitarian challenges: defending human dignity, restoring family links and reducing natural risks. Look out for the moving video testimony of a former detainee at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\n\n8) 4 p.m. To the lake\n\nSet off downhill from the museum and walk around the corner to the Broken Chair sculpture, which sits at one end of a long row of flags leading to the Palais des Nations, the European headquarters of the United Nations. Carry on down the slope to the enchanting and often-overlooked Botanical Garden, where dahlias, asters and autumn daffodils come into bloom as summer draws to a close. At the bottom of the garden, look for the small underground walkway that takes you below the traffic on Rue de Lausanne and straight to the edge of Lake Geneva (or Lac L\u00e9man, as it\u2019s called in French). Keeping the lake on your left, walk past the lawn of the World Trade Organization, continue through the landscaped Parc Mon Repos, and finally stroll along the Quai Wilson, where you can take in a view of Geneva\u2019s 460-foot-tall fountain, the Jet d\u2019Eau, across the lake.", "description": "At once deeply Swiss and intrinsically international, this city on the shores of Lake Geneva has carved out its own place in the world.", "authors": ["Paige Mcclanahan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/travel/12Hours-Geneva1/merlin_160289727_e561902e-6b0c-43d0-b463-011986dfeae4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
