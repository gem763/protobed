He spoke to lawmakers for around 10 hours.\n\nLawmakers leaving the closed-door deposition said there were gaps in his testimony, and said Sondland responded \"I don't know\" and \"I don't recall\" many times. But they said it was enlightening and damning as the political appointee and Trump donor described Giuliani's takeover of U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\n\"It is clear you have a shadow shakedown going on by Giuliani,\" said California Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House intelligence panel. \"I think it is just important for the American people to understand Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump and Donald Trump is Rudy Giuliani. If Rudy Giuliani is doing something it is because he's the lawyer for Donald Trump, and lawyers don't take actions that are not authorized by their clients.\"\n\nSondland's closed-door testimony to three House committees was aimed at distancing himself from Trump and Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Sondland said he was concerned that the president delegated to Giuliani foreign policy responsibilities that he thought belonged to the State Department, but Sondland followed Trump's instructions anyway. He insisted that he played no role in encouraging investigations of Biden, telling lawmakers that he thought it improper to invite a foreign government to conduct criminal probes to influence American elections.\n\nThe ambassador was the latest in a series of witnesses to be privately interviewed by three House committees conducting the impeachment investigation. He was one of several current and former Trump administration officials who have provided new information \u2014 and detailed diplomats' concerns \u2014 about Trump and Giuliani and their attempts to influence Ukraine.\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney defended Giuliani's involvement in foreign policy, saying, \"That's the president's call.\" Even if some people don't like it, he added, \"it's not Illegal. It's not impeachable. The president gets to use who he wants to use.\"\n\nThe investigators will continue apace next week, when they have tentatively scheduled multiple additional interviews with a mix of State Department diplomats and White House aides. Among them is the current top official at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, William Taylor, who exchanged text messages with Sondland this summer and fall as diplomats attempted to navigate Trump's demands.\n\nSondland's attempts to stand apart from Trump and Giuliani are notable since, unlike other career civil servants who have testified in the impeachment inquiry, he is a hand-picked political appointee of the president who contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee. His appearance was especially anticipated since the text messages and other witness testimony place him at the center of a foreign policy dialogue with Ukraine that officials feared circumvented normal channels and that is now at the center of the House impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nIn prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press, Sondland aimed to untether himself from any effort by the Republican president or Giuliani to have a political rival investigated, joining other current and former administration officials who have communicated to Congress misgivings about the administration's backchannel dealings with Ukraine.\n\nBut Sondland's pivotal role in the dialogue, including discussions about a quid-pro-quo in which Ukraine's president would get a coveted White House visit in exchange for satisfying Trump's push for corruption-related investigations, made some Democrats skeptical that he wasn't more closely involved.\n\n\"For purposes of the impeachment inquiry, it really doesn't matter whether Sondland was a knowing participant in this scheme or if he was an unwitting pawn,\" said California Rep. Ted Lieu as he left the deposition. \"He was still executing the policies of Rudy Giuliani and Rudy was following the orders of the president.\"\n\nSondland said he was disappointed by a May 23 meeting with Trump, who rejected calls by the ambassador and others to arrange without preconditions a phone call and White House visit for the new Ukraine leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.", "description": "The U.S. ambassador to the European Union told House impeachment investigators Thursday that President Donald Trump instructed him and other envoys to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Ukraine policy and that he was \"disappointed\" by the directive.
