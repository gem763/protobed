The more hashes, the stronger and more secure the Bitcoin blockchain is.\n\nAs an example of how quickly the metric has progressed this year, in September 2018, hashrate was around 55 quintillion h/s.\n\nKeiser: Fiat Will Suffer From BTC Strength\n\nThe impressive performance was not lost on commentators, with one, in particular, stating his belief that subdued markets would soon follow hash rate in its bullish trend.\n\nAccording to RT\u2019s Max Keiser, Bitcoin\u2019s price traditionally follows increases in hash rate, with hash rate lows triggering the start of bull markets.\n\nThat was the case at the beginning of 2019 when mining power began expanding after six months of contraction. Several months later, in April, Bitcoin\u2019s price began a several-month long bull run.\n\nNow, he says, the pace of the cryptocurrency\u2019s gains will, in turn, create difficulties for fiat currency.\n\n\u201cBitcoin hash (rate) set to break 100 (quintillion h/s),\u201d he tweeted on September 8.\n\n\u201cThis will start to become a problem for fiat as data centers dedicated to maintaining fiat systems are pulled into the BTC black hole of true value.\u201d\n\nInstitutions Line Up to Test BTC\n\nKeiser appeared to be referencing a theory about sound money. Bitcoin, as a finite currency which is difficult to produce, should become preferable to savers over fiat.\n\nThe latter, slips of paper and cheap metal coins, is conversely easy to produce but involves a huge amount of human effort in the form of central banks keeping fragile markets afloat.\n\nAs economics professor Saifedean Ammous points out in his book on the issue, The Bitcoin Standard, this energy is better spent on activities which are more productive for humanity and is a common feature unsound money at risk of collapse.\n\nThe move up in hash rate meanwhile comes at a timely juncture in Bitcoin\u2019s history. Later this month, institutional investors will begin using the long-awaited regulated trading platform Bakkt.\n\nBakkt will initially offer physical Bitcoin futures, which will require participants to accept and handle payouts in BTC, instead of fiat currencies such as the US dollar.\n\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin\u2019s current hashrate?
