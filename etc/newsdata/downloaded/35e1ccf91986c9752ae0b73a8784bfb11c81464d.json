His base does not care about the hurricane,\u201d said Barbara Res, a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization, who worked for Trump on and off from 1978 until 1998. \u201cThis is a personal thing. He just can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d\n\nThursday marked the fifth day that Trump was fixated on the idea that the state of Alabama was in the path of deadly Hurricane Dorian, which devastated the Bahamas and is now off the southeast coast of the U.S.\n\nSince Trump canceled a weekend trip to Poland to monitor the weather threat, news about Hurricane Dorian dominated the president\u2019s already prolific Twitter feed. He\u2019s retweeted information from national TV news networks about the perceived strength of the storm, satellite images from the National Weather Service and short videos of him attending FEMA briefings about Hurricane Dorian. The flood of information has given Americans the sense that the president is both closely monitoring the hurricane but also that his involvement is at the center of it.\n\nHis fact feud started Sunday with a presidential Twitter warning mentioning Alabama among the states likely to be hit \u201cmuch harder than anticipated.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Birmingham quickly corrected him online, writing on Twitter: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/169/1155968404_6083737993001_6083745742001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nBut Trump referenced Alabama again Sunday at an in-person FEMA briefing, then started attacking the media over it and kept stoking it on Twitter in the days that followed.\n\nTrump referenced Alabama again in person on Wednesday with some force, showing off a hurricane map \u2014 clumsily doctored with a black marker \u2014 that extended the path of the storm into Alabama.\n\nWhen asked by reporters how the Sharpie marker ended up on the printed map, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAs the controversy escalated with \u201cSharpiegate\u201d trending on Twitter, Trump tweeted out an early map of the storm \u2014 issued days before the president\u2019s first Alabama tweet \u2014 that did not come from the National Hurricane Center: \u201cThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!\u201d\n\nJust as the backlash over the hurricane gaffe appeared to die down on Thursday, Trump revived it by tweeting that \u201cAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News!\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s meteorologists saw the extended presidential eruption as an unhelpful diversion from a serious threat. The National Hurricane Center\u2019s latest estimate on Thursday afternoon showed Dorian approaching the coast of South Carolina and then hovering over or near the North Carolina coast Thursday night or Friday.\n\n\u201cThere is a potentially life-threatening hurricane headed for the Carolinas, and any distraction from making people aware of the potential consequences is not doing anyone a favor,\u201d said Dan Sobien, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. \u201cThis is a distraction from what the official government message should be right now.\u201d\n\nSobien said the union representing the National Weather Service has fielded numerous calls over the past 24 hours from managers from the weather service, private-sector businesses and union members asking how the National Weather Service can stop the president from continuing to repeat confusing information \u2014 or worse, undermining the fact-based reports from the Miami-based hurricane forecasters. They issue regularly scheduled hurricane reports at least four times a day.\n\n\u201cWhat is most important is that people listen to and trust the National Weather Service,\u201d Sobien said. \u201cI would hate it if someone from the coast of North Carolina might have gotten a mixed message.\u201d\n\nOne senior administration official said Trump kept talking about Alabama in the path of the hurricane because the state had been on a map cone by the National Weather Service and FEMA during a presidential briefing in the early days of the storm. It is still unclear who drew the now-infamous black Sharpie line on the map displayed in the Oval Office on Wednesday, a marking that extended the potential path of the hurricane to Alabama.\n\n\u201cHad it ripped across Florida, that\u2019s where it was going,\u201d the official said. \u201cSo far, U.S. lives and property have been spared from what could have been worse.\u201d\n\nThroughout Thursday, some aides and family were tweeting in defense of the president or mocking a CNN flub in retaliation.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/d0/94/78e439c5471981e284cbee8022d4/buttigieg.png\"\n\nAnd on Thursday evening, the White House released a testimonial on official letterhead from the president\u2019s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, Rear Adm. Peter J. Brown, about his storm briefings. Brown said the president\u2019s comments were based on a forecast showing the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama through Monday morning. (Official forecasts regarding wind in Alabama had diminished long before the president\u2019s warning.)\n\nFor current and former administration officials, the \u201cSharpiegate\u201d controversy echoed a movie they\u2019ve all seen many times before \u2014 and long ago grew immune to.\n\nIt started with Trump\u2019s inauguration and the president harping on the crowd size, even as photographs showed empty bleachers and a National Mall scene not as full as Trump would have liked in comparison to his predecessor\u2019s inauguration.\n\nMore recently, the same has happened for Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, whose economic burden the president insists is borne entirely by China. (American consumers, businesses, farmers and Wall Street are feeling the effects, too, according to multiple economic data points and forecasts.)\n\nEven in his business days, Trump would repeat statements executives at his organization knew were false, Res said \u2014 like telling people Princess Diana was going to take an apartment in Trump Tower, or inflating numbers when he was trying to make a sale.\n\n\u201cHe would tell the staff his ridiculous lies, and after a while, no one believed a single word he would say,\u201d Res said, adding that she never saw Trump back down in public from a misleading statement.\n\nDuring the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency, aides often would rush into the Oval Office and try to tell the president not to convey information a certain way or to inform him a fact was inaccurate. But aides soon learned Trump would inevitably tweet about it again anyway.\n\n\u201cIt was clear it was a futile effort,\u201d said one former senior administration official. \u201cHe has his own reality, and he will maintain that reality regardless of facts or evidence. My impression is that most people have given up on this.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides on Thursday mostly just shrugged and carried on with their day, so accustomed have they grown to the president\u2019s operating style.", "description": "The Trumpification of a deadly hurricane turned a forgettable flub into an unforgettable presidential feud.", "authors": ["Nancy Cook"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b2/90/b7a1e85f46ed9cfc80d3a65db590/1995-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
