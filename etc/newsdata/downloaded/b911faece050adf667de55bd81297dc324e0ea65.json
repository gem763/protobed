These whole-body suits function as external skeletons to help people walk when they \"have very high-level spinal cord injuries as well as pretty serious [paralysis from] strokes,\" he said.\n\n\"But not many people have access to these robots, which we know help rehabilitate people, because they're not yet considered to be mainstream rehabilitation treatments,\" he said.\n\nHelping healthcare start-ups\n\nOne of the keys to his success is \"hacking\" technology originally intended for other uses and applying it to patient rehab, such as the $10 cardboard glasses stroke patients can buy online for watching on their smartphones a virtual reality video created by his team to stimulate neural responses.\n\n\"We aim to develop low-cost healthcare solutions that are easily accessible for people,\" said Dr Putrino, who is also assistant professor of rehabilitation medicine at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine.\n\nDr Putrino and his team at the Mount Sinai Abilities Research Centre run clinical trials using existing technology easily bought online and \"help healthcare technology start-ups bridge the gap between early-stage ideas and a ready-for-market product by conducting clinical research,\" he said.\n\n\"According to a 2016 Forbes magazine article, 98 per cent of digital health start-ups are zombies, meaning these digital health start-ups died before they touched a patient.\"\n\nAll these venture capital funds were pouring money into healthcare start-ups that didn't have a channel to enter the medical system because it was not geared to respond to new technology, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It often takes 17 years for anything new to become mainstream treatment,\" Dr Putrino said.\n\n\"Of course technology needs to be rigorously tested, but that time frame is too long, which is why our lab runs clinical trials and where necessary seeks [US] Food and Drug administration approval for new technology.\"", "description": "Dr David Putrino has won the 2019 Advance Australia award, a federal government award for international Australians who exhibit remarkable talent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/90729d8d0ea0fa574fab7ec572a85bea2176e7ef", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
