Most girls there undergo the practice, which involves the partial or total removal of external genitalia, aged between five and nine.\n\nA family court had ruled that the girl could be subjected to FGM if taken abroad after social services applied for a protection order to stop her being deported.\n\nBut Britain\u2019s Home Office, which handles immigration issues, challenged the court\u2019s power to prevent her deportation and on Wednesday the court accepted it did not have such powers.\n\nBritain claims it protects girls from FGM. So why are we deporting them? | Charlotte Proudman Read more\n\nThe Home Office did not respond to a request for comment on the case by the time of publication.\n\nThe UK has invested heavily in efforts to combat FGM in countries where it is practised, notably in parts of Africa, and is viewed as an international leader in the field.\n\nBut Charlotte Proudman, the lawyer who represented the girl\u2019s mother in court, said there was a contradiction between the government\u2019s stated commitment to end FGM and its immigration policies.\n\n\u201cThey are happy to prosecute FGM, they are happy to give money abroad to stamp it out, but they are failing to protect women who are at risk if deported,\u201d Proudman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nFGM is linked with severe long-term complications including cysts, infections and complications in childbirth. In the most severe cases, the vaginal opening is sewn up.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother said she had undergone FGM, as had her two sisters, who both died as a result, according to court papers.\n\nOne of the single biggest indicators that a girl is at risk is her mother having been cut, studies have shown.\n\nAbout 87% of Sudan\u2019s women aged between 15 and 49 have been cut, and the majority have undergone the severest form, infibulation, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAlthough FGM is a recognised ground for asylum in Britain, the Home Office \u2013 the government department responsible for immigration \u2013 has previously argued that the risk in similar cases was low.\n\nProudman said she would ask the government to accept expert assessments of the risks the girl faced if deported and grant her secure immigration status.\n\nAnti-FGM campaigner Alimatu Dimonekene said authorities were failing to consider the rights of children when processing the asylum applications of their parents.\n\n\u201cThis girl will be at risk not only of FGM if she returns to these countries, but will be at risk of other known extreme forms of violence,\u201d added Dimonekene, who runs the charity A Girl At A Time.", "description": "Fears child may return to Sudan via Bahrain after Home Office challenged efforts to stop deportation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b054322774201b2acd87abaaaa999e0c848590c/0_19_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f9888e695e926298368571122ed7d697", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
