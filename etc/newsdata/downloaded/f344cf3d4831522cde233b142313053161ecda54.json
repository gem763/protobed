The move allows the committee to designate certain hearings as impeachment hearings, and empower staff to question witnesses for a longer period of time.\n\nMr Trump is travelling to Baltimore today for a Republican fundraising event and the House Republican Conference member retreat dinner, and is scheduled to speak just after 7pm EST. That is about an hour before the debate is set to start, meaning any delay could put the two events into conflict.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.
