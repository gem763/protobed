It lifted the lid on what was seen by many as a toxic culture within Westminster in which women and men who experienced or were experiencing inappropriate treatment had stayed silent for years.\n\nAs well as the phone line, which has had 285 callers, the independent complaints and grievances scheme run by the Commons authorities provides a channel for people to complain about an individual, whether it is a colleague, staffer, MP or peer.\n\nBut on the second anniversary of #metoo, there are still concerns that there has not been a significant cultural shift in behaviour in parliament.\n\nThe Labour MP Jess Phillips said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say nothing has changed because the former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and those working with her had a real will to set up a system that would work.\n\n\u201cBut the culture hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s still very much the case, and I can cite conversations about this, where if you don\u2019t like the person that is complaining then they are [presumed to be] lying. There\u2019s still a culture of friends and patronage in parliament. You sort out the culture by genuinely having trust in a process.\u201d\n\nPhillips said the new complaints scheme, in which the accused receives anonymity throughout the entire process, was in its infancy and its effectiveness in helping to change behaviour in the long term had yet to be seen.\n\nTara Jane O\u2019Reilly, 25, who founded the Women in Westminster network this year to support female members of staff, said \u201cThings have been put in place like the helpline and there\u2019s now a behaviour code but in terms of actual cultural change, I don\u2019t think that has happened at all.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly not enough change for us to start celebrating yet. I don\u2019t think people have necessarily stopped behaving inappropriately but they have become maybe smarter in what they do. I still hear from other female staffers of men being incredibly inappropriate in terms of what\u2019s been said to them and also physically.\u201d\n\nAllegations that emerged in 2017 led to the resignation as defence secretary of Michael Fallon, who it was reported that he attempted to kiss a journalist on the lips in 2003. He admitted his behaviour towards women had fallen short of standards expected by the Conservative party.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s first secretary of state Damian Green lost his job after it was found that he lied to colleagues about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer, which he maintains he did not download or view. Green also apologised to the journalist Kate Maltby for making her feel uncomfortable after she alleged he had behaved improperly towards her, though he said he did not recognise her account of events.\n\nIn the aftermath of those cases, dozens of anonymous accounts of people\u2019s experiences \u2013 ranging from inappropriate comments to touching \u2013 were reported by the media, prompting Leadsom, then leader of the Commons, to take charge of the way parliament should protect its workers.\n\nOne of the problems highlighted was that MPs\u2019 staff had never been covered by any form of human resources. This is is believed to have contributed to chronic under reporting of incidents as was the fact that many staffers arrive in Westminster in their early 20s straight from university and may not be familiar with normal employment structures.\n\nLeadsom said she was proud of the crossparty work that had been done to improve the lives of everyone who working in or visiting parliament. She also implemented a new behaviour code and training courses for MPs, although they are not mandatory.\n\n\u201cThe independent complaints procedure will transform behaviour in parliament, ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect. As more cases come forward and those who have been badly treated get redress for their complaints, we will start to see real behaviour change.,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\nThe highest number of investigations carried out since the scheme was set up was 14, between October and December 2018. Because of the anonymity afforded the processes, it is not known who the individuals involved were, whether they were found to have acted inappropriately or what sanctions, if any, were imposed. The figures for the next quarter are due out on Monday.\n\nThe leader of the of Commons, Jacob Rees Mogg, is understood to be keen to carry on with the work started by Leadsom. He met Phillips as soon as he was appointed to take her advice on which areas needed more work.\n\nHe said: \u201cEveryone in parliament should feel safe in their working environment. The reforms steered through the house by my predecessor Andrea Leadsom offer complainants confidentiality and an assurance that their cases will be heard independently and expertly. We are making good progress, but there is more to be done.\u201d\n\nDiscussions are continuing on whether to open the independent complaints procedure to cases that pre-date 2017 and to former employees.", "description": "Reports continue about inappropriate behaviour despite helpline and series of changes", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f1ed595f2fa681207117f4fade01f6de4aa411/0_0_5131_3079/master/5131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=098dbcdda03fce9755e6cca474af5bba", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
