We spent 582 days dreaming of this moment. We're still in shock and trying to process our emotions,\" he said.\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland tweeted she was relieved by the news. Canada had worked behind the scenes to press for Mombeini's release, said a Canadian government official.\n\n\"We are grateful to the Canadian government, and specifically Foreign Minister Freeland for their unwavering support from day one. We are also thankful to Iran for allowing our mother ... to finally leave,\" Raam said by email.\n\nMombeini returned just five days after Iranian authorities freed an Australian couple who spent more than three months in a prison in Tehran.\n\nThe Canadian government official said Mombeini's release had removed a \"big obstacle\" to the process of improving relations. Canada cut all diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.\n\n\"We had had a couple of visits of Iranian officials here and we had visited there a couple of times as part of seeking some level of re-engagement and we put that all on ice after she was subject to the travel ban,\" said the official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nBilateral ties between Iran and Canada worsened in 2003 when an Iranian-Canadian photo journalist, Zahra Kazemi, died in Tehran's Evin prison while in custody.
