(AP) - A lifesaving gesture by a Clifton man\u2019s best friend saved the life of the special-needs niece he raised from childhood and helped three more gravely ill people through a live organ-exchange program.\n\nJoseph Porretta donated his kidney on Oct. 2, coming to the rescue of Tiffany Sheppard, 24, who was raised from age 8 by his best friend from Clifton High School, Joe Bray.\n\nHis kidney, however, went to a patient in California, while Sheppard received a live kidney from Utah. The connection was facilitated by St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston\u2019s Living Donation Kidney Exchange Program, which results in quicker and better statistical outcomes for the patients.\n\n\u201cI found out I was compatible, but because there\u2019s some age difference between me and Tiffany, they put us in this national exchange program,\u201d said Porretta, 51, a retired parole officer who lives in Rockaway Township with his wife and son.\n\nDr. Stuart Geffner, director of kidney and transplant surgery and chairman of the department of surgery at SBMC, said transplants of live kidneys are usually more successful than waiting for \u201cdeceased donor\u201d kidneys.\n\n\u201cSome patients have a potential living donor, but that donor might not be compatible for them,\u201d Geffner said. \u201cSo the idea is that if Patient A needs a kidney, and their donor is incompatible, and Patient B needs a kidney, and their intended donor is incompatible, then perhaps Patient A\u2019s donor is compatible with Patient B, and Patient B\u2019s donor is compatible to Patient A. And therefore, both patients can be transplanted.\u201d\n\nA 2016 blood test unrelated to her condition revealed previously unknown problems with Sheppard\u2019s kidneys. Subsequent testing revealed she was only born with one kidney, and it was undersized.\n\nShe immediately started regular dialysis treatments, reporting to the hospital three times a week for 3 1/2-hour sessions. Three years later, she entered the exchange program with Poretta in August, and they were matched just four days later.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly valuable program for our patients,\u201d Geffner said. \u201cIf patients do not have a potential living donor, they have to wait on a waiting list, and that waiting list in New Jersey is five to seven years. Patients generally do not do that well on dialysis for that long.\u201d\n\nThe successful surgery on Oct. 2 was \u201clife-changing\u201d for her, Bray said. It was also delayed for several hours because Sheppard\u2019s new kidney, which arrived on a red-eye flight at JFK Airport, \u201cgot stuck in traffic in Brooklyn.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter three years, no more dialysis,\u201d Bray said \u201cShe is starting to lead a normal life again.\u201d\n\nSheppard will be \u201cgrounded\u201d for about six more weeks as she heals and adjusts to anti-rejection medications that have compromised her immune system. But she hopes to resume participating in Special Olympics sporting events and looks forward to being healthy for the holidays, Bray said.\n\nThe family also will be counting its blessings this holiday season, starting with the astounding gesture by Porretta, who is still recovering, but is on his feet and able to drive.\n\n\u201cI was best man at his wedding, and he was best man at mine,\u201d Poretta said of Bray. \u201cWe are like brothers and I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing is, he didn\u2019t only help my Tiff,\u201d Bray said of Poretta. \u201cWhen he donated his kidney, Tiff got hers and someone else got his. That\u2019s two, but with those two off the list, two more people moved up. So he really helped four people.\u201d\n\nSheppard is similarly grateful to the man she knows as her father\u2019s best friend.\n\n\u201cWhen she found out, she almost tackled him,\u201d Bray said. \u201cShe grabbed him and said, \u2018You\u2019re my hero\u2019.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2VTM0dW\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Record (Parsippany, N.J.), http://www.dailyrecord.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A lifesaving gesture by a Clifton man's best friend saved the life of the special-needs niece he raised from childhood and helped three more gravely ill people through a live organ-exchange program.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "William Westhoven"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
