REUTERS/John Amis/File Picture\n\nThe Republican leader faces allegations he abused his office by pushing Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Earlier on Tuesday, the Trump administration blocked a key witness from appearing before three House committees, prompting a subpoena.\n\n\u201cTell the truth, I think, for a change,\u201d Carter told MSNBC when asked what advice he would give Trump.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing over Ukraine and has reacted to the inquiry with a flurry of posts on Twitter lobbing obscenities and insulting nicknames for Democratic lawmakers, who launched their impeachment probe two weeks ago.\n\nWhile the Republican-led Senate now is \u201cunlikely\u201d to remove Trump even if the Democratic-controlled House backs impeachment, Carter said that could change depending on what the investigation reveals.\n\n\u201cIf the facts reveal an increasing number of things that he has actually done, then of course impeachment is possible and removal from office is possible,\u201d the nation\u2019s oldest living former president told MSNBC.\n\nCarter, 95, ran on a pledge of honesty and served one term in the White House from 1977 to 1981. He suffered from his own political controversies including a U.S. hostage crisis in Iran.\n\nHe criticized Trump\u2019s response to the impeachment probe, saying blocking witnesses and documents was \u201cstonewalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a departure from custom and a departure from what the American people expect,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThat in itself is going to be ... another item of evidence that can be used against him.\u201d\n\nTrump, he said, should restrain himself on Twitter and \u201cgive the House of Representatives and the Senate \u2014 and the general public \u2014 the evidence that we need to form a case either for or against him.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the other living former U.S. presidents \u2014 Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republican George W. Bush \u2014 could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nClinton became the second U.S. president to be impeached by in 1998 but was not removed from office by the Senate. Congress took up impeachment proceedings against President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 under threat of impeachment.", "description": "Former Democratic U.S. President Jimmy Carter on Tuesday called on President Donald Trump to cooperate with Congress' impeachment inquiry, saying his refusal to comply with lawmakers' requests has left Americans grappling for answers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438615099&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971KV", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
