In a series of lighthearted videos, the couple tells it like it is about everything from the birds and the bees to the food on their plates at mealtime. Eschewing the little white lies parents often employ, the couple embraces a simple truth: when you have food that\u2019s honestly good, you don\u2019t have to lie to get people\u2014even your kids\u2014to eat it.\n\n\u201cPartnering with Kristen and Dax is a significant moment for the brand,\u201d said Michael Lenahan, Vice President of Marketing at Greenleaf Foods, SPC. \u201cAs America\u2019s most honest, relatable, and fun-loving celebrity couple, they share Lightlife\u2019s core brand values. This campaign underscores our commitment to empowering families and inspiring honest conversations about food around the dinner table.\u201d\n\nLightlife, the plant-based pioneer, has been at the forefront of plant-based eating for decades, long before flexitarianism became mainstream. With a rich history of innovation, the brand\u2019s portfolio has grown to span a wide selection of plant-based proteins, including burgers, dogs, grounds, sausages, chicken and tempeh. The hero of its newest line, the Lightlife Burger, is everything you crave from a traditional beef burger, yet is made from plants, and contains half the ingredients of other plant-based burgers, making it honestly good\u2014for you, your taste buds and the planet.\n\n\u201cAt Lightlife, we believe that plant-based proteins are for everyone\u2014whether you\u2019re a vegetarian, flexitarian, or a meat eater simply looking for more protein options,\u201d said Dan Curtin, President and CEO of Greenleaf Foods, SPC. \u201cWe often hear from parents that their entire family loves the taste of Lightlife, and parents love serving nutritious, plant-based foods.\u201d\n\nThis marks the second large-scale campaign that Lightlife has brought to market this year. It will be broadly advertised through digital, social and audio media, and can be found at lightlife.com/atasteofhonesty.
