It\u2019s a body. When it goes, we\u2019re gone, so it\u2019s best to look after it while we\u2019ve got it.\n\nTo do that, it helps to know what\u2019s inside it and how it works. That\u2019s what Bill Bryson sets out to tell us in his latest book \u201cThe Body: A Guide for Occupants.\u201d\n\nAs in his numerous earlier books \u2014 notably \u201cThe Mother Tongue and A Short History of Nearly Everything\u201d \u2014 this volume is full of humor, but also packed chock-a-block with information.\n\nSome of it you may feel you\u2019d rather not know. One relative of mine prefers to think his body is full of sand rather than contemplate the beating of the heart, the physics of the eye, the strategies of the liver and, especially, the myriad coils and containers of the alimentary system. Mr. Bryson\u2019s encouraging comments jolly such folk along:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d he notes, \u201cthat you can sit at a dinner party, enjoying yourself extravagantly \u2014 eating, talking, laughing, breathing, slurping wine \u2014 and that your nasopharyngeal guardians will send everything to the right place, in two directions, without you having to give it a moment\u2019s consideration. \u2026 While you are chattering away about work or school catchment zones, the price of kale, your brain is closely monitoring not just the taste and freshness of what you are eating, but also its bulk and texture \u2026 Meanwhile, you, far from assisting this critical process, just keep pouring more red wine down your throat, destabilizing all your internal systems and seriously compromising your brain\u2019s functional capabilities.\u201d\n\nExactly how everything functions \u2014 and, especially, how it all functions together \u2014 is explained in 23 chapters, most of them devoted to one part of our physiology, beginning with \u201cThe Outside: Skin and Hair\u201d and moving on through every bodily system until we reach \u201cNerves and Pain.\u201d All this is extraordinarily informative, both in tracing how early doctors and researchers worked out what happens inside us, but also in highlighting how much of our medical knowledge was not discovered until the late-19th century or later.\n\nAnd, as the author often points out there\u2019s still lots to learn. We don\u2019t even know why we age. Noting three types of theories \u2014 genetic mutation theories, wear-and-tear theories and cellular waste accumulation theories \u2014 he says \u201cIt may well be that all three factors work together, or it may be that any two of the above are side effects of the third. Or it may be something else altogether. No one knows.\u201d\n\nBut what we all know and suffer is disease and death. The final four chapters of \u201cThe Body\u201d deal with these, and the picture is darker because we see how much of what happens to us when we are sick is not just biological: It\u2019s also social and financial.\n\nAs a result, the people of some countries have much better outcomes than those of others. This is not just a matter of rich countries outstripping the poor ones, though wealth is a factor. You are likely to live until your late 80s \u201cIf you are middle-aged, well off, and from almost any high-income nation.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, when it comes to curing the diseases that kill us \u2014 heart disease, cancer \u2014 even high-income nations exhibit big variations. \u201cIt is not a good idea to be an American,\u201d Mr. Bryson writes. \u201ceven being well off doesn\u2019t help you.\u201d As he says, this is counter-intuitive considering not only the wealth of America, but also that the country spends on health care \u201ctwo and half times more per person \u2026 than the average for all the other developed nations of the world.\u201d\n\nHe explains this paradox by noting America\u2019s unhealthy lifestyle, including over-size food portions; the risks of traffic and gun accidents, especially to young people; and the colossal costs of health care. Notably, when it comes to the five-year survival rate of cancer patients, the United States is tops for breast cancer, but South Korea and Australia are significantly ahead for colon cancer, Japan and Denmark for cervical cancer. Overall for cancer survival, \u201cAustralia, New Zealand, the Nordic countries and the wealthier nations of the Far East all do really well, and other European countries do pretty well. For the United States the result is mixed.\u201d\n\nThis is scary. But the overall impact of \u201cThe Body\u201d is celebratory. The author marvels at the intricacies of the human body and its extraordinary feats of timing and fine-tuning. He digs into history to show the persistence and tribulations of researchers. He describes the amazing feats of medicine and surgery accomplished in the last few decades. Even his critical account of how America, and also Britain, fail their people medically is invigorating.\n\nIn short, this fact-packed story-strewn volume is a fascinating read, a book to own and return when questions arise \u2014 as they always do.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE BODY: A GUIDE FOR OCCUPANTS\n\nBy Bill Bryson\n\nDoubleday, $30, 464 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
