Fans saw her exit as she swore to clear her name and return to her family a free woman.\n\nTony (left) and Ziva (right) may finally be reuniting (Picture: Getty)\n\nShe may be gone now, but showrunners are already bracing fans for her seemingly inevitable return. And yes, a \u2018Tiva\u2019 reunion is probably 100% happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There will be four episodes [with Ziva],\u2019 producer Frank Gardea told Parade Magazine (via Newsweek). \u2018Two early on, and two in fall/winter.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re very well aware of the Tony-Ziva connection,\u2019 added exec Steven Binder. \u2018And the fans desire and response to it.\u2019\n\nCote de Pablo\u2019s return as Ziva was on the cards for quite some time (Picture: CBS)\n\nThat means that fans have already seen the first two instalments\u2026and there\u2019s two left to go. Given that Tony got into contact with Gibbs about Ziva, we know it won\u2019t be long until the star-crossed lovers are reunited \u2013 probably in the most dramatic and heart-wrenching way possible.\n\nCote de Pablo herself also previously shared the news that her character would only be back for a short stint in the high-octane drama, but her return has been on the cards for some time.\n\n\u2018This time they wanted to really have a serious discussion about where I thought the character had been in the past five years,\u2019 the actress said. \u2018And how we could potentially create a complex and fun storyline to bring the character back.\u2019\n\nNCIS is broadcast on Fox UK and is also available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
