Well, look no further, because last night\u2019s Late Night With Seth Meyers featured a very helpful commercial parody starring writers Amber Ruffin, Jenny Hagel, and Ally Hord that answers the question: \u201cWhat the hell is an impeachment inquiry anyway?\u201d It\u2019s all very simple, really: An impeachment inquiry leads to an investigation by Congress, which leads to debates about what the Constitution defines as a \u201chigh crime,\u201d which leads to more investigations by six House committees that are presented to the Judiciary Committee, which leads to a House vote, which leads to a Senate trial involving the president\u2019s lawyers and a Supreme Court justice, which leads to a decision by the Senate majority leader. The whole process takes at least a handful of months if not over a year, and after it\u2019s all said and done, the president will be impeached. Or maybe not impeached! Anyway, that sounds simple enough, right? Thanks for clearing all of that up for us, Late Night!\n\nRelated", "description": "On NBC\u2019s \u2018Late Night With Seth Meyers,\u2019 writers Amber Ruffin, Jenny Hagel, and Ally Hord star in a commercial parody that explains the impeachment process.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-late-night-seth-meyers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
