Again, she left. One lawmaker wearing a paper mask showing the face of Chinese President Xi Jinping tossed a placard as Lam was leaving.\n\nFinally, 75 minutes after the previously scheduled start of the lengthy address, Lam delivered it via video link, with China's yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong's flag on her left.\n\nDescribing the semi-autonomous Chinese city as going through \"major crisis,\" Lam said: \"People are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?\"\n\nShe appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to \"cherish the city,\" warning that \"continued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.\"\n\nStanding ramrod-straight, she then launched into a dry and detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong's shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent, and other welfare issues. With its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for development, the 50-minute speech seemed likely to fuel protesters' criticism that Lam is deaf to their concerns about the future of the territory's freedoms, unique in China.\n\nLam's speech a 'shame and a sham'\n\nEven before Lam delivered it, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed the address as a \"shame and a sham\" and said the chief executive had lost all authority.\n\n\"She is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,\" Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam's address there.\n\nThey played a recording on a small loudspeaker they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters' wails.\n\nPro-democracy lawmakers, who are seeking major changes in Hong Kong, shouted slogans during the address. (Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters)\n\n\"These are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,\" said lawmaker Tanya Chan. \"Please, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don't let us suffer any more.\"\n\nShe and others called for Lam's resignation. \"This is the only way that we can have a good future,\" said Chan.\n\nLam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement.\n\nU.S. shows support for pro-democracy protesters\n\nHong Kong's leader is expressing \"frustration and disappointment and regret\" over steps by U.S. Congress to support pro-democracy protesters in the territory.\n\nLam said, \"This Hong Kong human rights and democracy act is totally unjustified and unwarranted.\"\n\nShe said it \"will hurt not only the Hong Kong business. It will hurt American interests in Hong Kong. They have 1,400 companies, 85,000 citizens in Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe House on Tuesday passed three bills, approved on separate voicevotes, aimed at showing U.S. support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, one each that:", "description": "In chaotic scenes, furious pro-democracy lawmakers twice forced Hong Kong's leader to stop delivering a speech laying out her policy objectives and clamoured for her to resign after she walked out of the legislature on Wednesday and then delivered the annual address 75 minutes late via television.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5322332.1571201364!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hongkong-protests-carrie-lam.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
