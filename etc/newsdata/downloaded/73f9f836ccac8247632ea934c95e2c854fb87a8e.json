Half the people support the peace pact with the Farc guerrillas negotiated by President Santos. The rest, led by ex-president Uribe, is against the accord. Father Dar\u00edo Ech\u00e9verri took part in the negotiations and thinks the Pope\u2019s visit could be used politically.\n\n\u201cThe government wants the Pope, with all his moral authority, to endorse what the Government did, for which they risked everything. I understand it. I, as a priest, would hope that the Pope\u2019s visit is not going to be left bogged down, pawned off or reduced to just that,\u201d he said.\n\nSix thousand conflict victims are attending an act of reconciliation with Pope Francis. Consuelo Gonz\u00e1lez spent seven years kidnapped by Farc. She thinks forgiveness is needed to overcome a polarization that worries her.\n\n\u201cA lot of damage has been inflicted on families, on friendships that were valuable and today are affected by the positions taken over the peace process. We cannot allow Colombia to keep living in an era of hate,\u201d said Consuelo Gonzalez De Perdomo.\n\nConsuelo and Angela Girado, whose brother was murdered by the Farc, think that victims should play a more important role.\n\n\u201cFarc are going to have seats in Congress, obviously to defend some points of the Peace. We the victims are not going to have any representation in Congress,\u201d said Angela Giraldo Cadavid.\n\nShe confirms that not everyone affected by the Farc favors the peace accords.\n\n\u201cVictims that oppose the peace process do that because of the same confrontational atmosphere that we have in Colombia. There are some that take it in a political way and think that supporting the peace process is supporting President Santos and that being against the process is being in favor of president Uribe,\u201d she said.\n\nThat confrontation is part of daily life in Colombian households.\n\n\u201cPolarization in Colombia could grow ahead of the 2018 presidential elections. Those who are against the peace pact have already said that they are going to tear it to shreds if they win. It seems difficult that Pope Francis\u2019s visit will calm both sides,\u201d reports euronews\u2019 H\u00e9ctor Estepa, in Bogot\u00e1.", "description": "With Colombia divided over the FARC peace process Pope Francis walks a fine line with his message of reconciliation.", "authors": ["Robert Hackwill"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/386870/1000x563_386870.jpg", "published_at": "2017-09-07"}
