We like a challenge. We always felt the next move would have to be the perfect opportunity and we see this as the perfect opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe feel we can add value here. The opportunity to be managers as opposed to head coach was important to us, because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always worked.\n\n\u201cI want to wake up in the morning with that feeling, that buzz. I look at the job in front of us and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\n\nHuddersfield have won just one game since November 25 last year and have collected only one point in six Championship matches this season. They were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Cowley\u2019s Lincoln.\n\nCowley began his managerial career with non-League Concord Rangers and then worked at Braintree before guiding Lincoln from the National League to League One.\n\nHe sees the move to the John Smith\u2019s Stadium as a logical next step.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe want to be challenged. I want to live life. The safer option would have been to stay at Lincoln, a club we loved and felt a connection with.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a lot easier to stay but we are not interested in easy decisions. We want to test ourselves. I didn\u2019t want to die wondering.\u201d", "description": "Danny Cowley insists taking over as manager at Huddersfield Town was an exciting opportunity he could not turn down.
