Elijah Cummings", "language": "en", "text": "BALTIMORE \u2013 The city of Baltimore is mourning the loss of Rep. Elijah Cummings, who represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District until his death Thursday. He was 68.\n\nCummings died from complications of \"longstanding health challenges\" at 2:30 a.m. EDT at Gilchrist Hospice Care, his office said in a statement. Within hours, flowers were placed in front of his downtown offices and, at city hall, flags were flying at half-staff.\n\n\"A fearless champion of justice who fought tirelessly for civil rights & equality for everyone, including his beloved Baltimore,\" the NAACP, which is headquartered in Baltimore, said in a statement. \"Our democracy is stronger because of him.\"\n\nBaltimore Mayor Bernard C. Young lamented the loss of \"a powerful voice and one of the strongest and most gifted crusaders for social justice\" in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"He was, simply put, a man of God who never forgot his duty to fight for the rights and dignity of the marginalized and often forgotten,\" Young said of Cummings.\n\nCongressman Elijah Cummings speaks to the media the morning after citywide riots following the funeral of Freddie Gray, on April 28, 2015 in Baltimore, Maryland. Gray, 25, was arrested for possessing a switch blade knife April 12 outside the Gilmor Houses housing project on Baltimore's west side. More\n\nLarry Gibson, a professor at the University of Maryland Law School where Cummings graduated in 1976, said Baltimore was just as proud of Cummings as he was of the city. Gibson attended the same high school and college as Cummings and noted that as he rose through the ranks of Maryland politics, the late congressman always emerged as a leader.\n\n\"Now of course we\u2019re in a period of deep mourning. But we\u2019ve got lots of memories,\" Gibson said. \"There\u2019s going to be a very strong physical presence forever of him.\"\n\nA small group of reporters gathered outside Cummings' Baltimore home on a quiet tree-lined street in the 2000 block of Madison Avenue. The house bears a sign in the window that reads \"Re-elect Cummings for Congress,\" and a single bouquet of white flowers lay on its front steps.\n\nSome neighbors were peeking out of windows or sitting on their stoops, including Darrin Timpson, 23.\n\n\"It's very sad for his family and the black community,\" he said. \"That's one person that really has not let the city down.\"\n\nTimpson remembered the late congressman was the guest speaker at a football banquet he attended when he was 13 and said he was \"distraught\" when he learned of his death.\n\n'Don't just come and criticize': Elijah Cummings defends Baltimore in face of Trump's insults\n\nCynthia Wilson, 54, said residents are left wondering who will be able to pick up where Cummings left off.\n\n\"We need somebody that's strong and who will fight for Baltimore just like he did,\" she said, sitting in the doorway of the home she's lived in for 12 years. \"He protected Baltimore, he loved Baltimore and he did everything he could to help Baltimore ... He meant a lot to Baltimore, and we was blessed to have him for as long as we did.\"\n\nWilson said she respected Cummings for always defending Baltimore, including when President Donald Trump derided Cummings' district as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\"\n\nBut she said it was seeing him march in the streets during the riots after Freddie Gray's death in 2015 that \"gave him king status.\" A state of emergency was declared in the city when hundreds took to the streets after Gray, 25, died of injuries sustained during police transport.\n\n\"Nobody ever stood up like he did,\" Wilson said. \"He actually walked in the street while they (were) throwing trash cans and all that. And he just locked arms with people and kept going.\"\n\nBishop Walter Thomas has been the pastor at Rep. Elijah Cummings' church since 1975. More", "description": "Rep.
