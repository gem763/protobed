Mr. Trudeau was already in a tough election fight before the images emerged, with his Liberal Party running in a virtual tie with Conservatives ahead of a vote on Oct. 21. Shoring up support in urban areas, which have sizable immigrant communities, is crucial for Mr. Trudeau to hang on to power, analysts say.\n\nDespite his effort to move on, the blackface controversy continued to dog Mr. Trudeau\u2019s campaign on Friday. In response to reporters\u2019 questions in the Oval Office, President Trump said he was surprised to learn Mr. Trudeau wore blackface, \u201cand I was more surprised when I saw the number of times.\u201d\n\nAsked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Mr. Trudeau said he recognized he \u201churt people who in many cases considered me an ally\u2026by the terrible choices I made many years ago. I apologize deeply to them.\u201d Mr. Trudeau declined for a second day to say with certainty that more damaging photos wouldn\u2019t emerge.\n\nRelated Video On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for a second time after old images of him wearing brown and blackface surfaced. The Liberal Party leader said he is, \u201cwary of being definitive,\u201d when he was asked how many times he has worn brown or blackface makeup.

In the prior decade, covering 2006 to 2015, the average was 174 a year.\n\nMr. Trudeau used the policy announcement to launch an attack on his main rivals, the Conservatives, and portray them as a threat to urban safety. Nightly polling during the election campaign from Ottawa-based Nanos Research indicates a tight race between the Liberals and Conservatives, although the firm\u2019s numbers have the Tories recently pulling slightly ahead.\n\n\u201cThoughts and prayers are just not going to cut it,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cThe choice could not be clearer. Liberals are for tougher gun laws, Conservatives are for weaker gun laws.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau said a re-elected Liberal government would set up a buyback program for assault rifles that were legally purchased. He also said he would work with Canadian provinces to give local governments the power to ban or further restrict handguns in specific cities. The mayors of Toronto and Montreal have both called for a ban on handguns.\n\nUnder current Canadian laws, individuals are required to hold a license to purchase and possess a firearm and buy ammunition. According to data from Canada\u2019s national police, there were 2.2 million firearms licenses in force as of 2017.\n\nGun control is a divisive issue in Canada. People in larger cities and suburbs tend to favor strict controls, while rural residents argue tougher restrictions target law-abiding gun owners who use the weapons for hunting and self-protection.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Friday he supports gun-control measures such as screening for gun owners, but questions whether a blanket ban on particular firearms would make a difference.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard from police experts is that it\u2019s more effective, it will lead to safer communities, if we use police resources to go after criminals and illegal firearms,\u201d Mr. Scheer said.\n\n\u2014Vivian Salama in Washington contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com and Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "description": "After two days of apologies over photos showing him wearing blackface, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tried to pivot election-campaign talk toward gun control with a promise to ban military-style assault rifles and give cities the power to ban handguns.", "authors": ["Kim Mackrael", "Paul Vieira", "Kim.Mackrael Wsj.Com", "Paul.Vieira Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109336/social", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
