Nifty recovered Wednesday from 2-weeks low of 11091.30 and made a high of 11362.35 early Friday but suddenly plunged again and made a low of 11189.50. Although there was no clear catalyst behind the sudden plunge, there was a report of an explosion in an Indian oil tanker at a Saudi Port. Also terrible Indian auto sales data from SIAM may have affected the risk-on sentiment.\n\nIn any way, there was already a strong buzz that the Indian government may soon announce a personal tax cut (fiscal stimulus) to boost consumer spending ahead of Diwali. The Indian market jumped mid-Wednesday after Modi government hiked the DA (dearness allowance to compensate higher inflation) by 5% (from 12% to 17%) for almost 5M central government employees and 6.2M central government pensioners as a \u2018Diwali Gift\u201d, which was stalled for the last three months.\n\nThe market was also boosted on upbeat global cues on hopes and hypes of a Brexit deal coupled with another report that China is open for a partial trade deal despite Chinese techs blacklisting by Trump admin. Earlier on Wednesday, Nifty made a 2-week low of 11091.30 trackings subdued global cues (fading hopes of an interim U.S.-China trade deal), less dovish RBI cuts and IMF downgrade of India\u2019s economic prospect. But Nifty soon got some boost in hopes of IBC/NCLT reform by the Modi government.\n\nThe Indian government may introduce a time-bound online bidding process of stressed companies under IBC/NCLT mechanism to accelerate the overall resolution process in a transparent and less disruptive manner. At present, the IBC/NCLT resolution process is marred with various controversies, judicial cases, delays in the bidding process- hampering the overall recovery process of India\u2019s legacy corporate NPA. The market is quite optimistic that the IBC/NCLT reform will be positive for banks/financial institutions/lenders for the speedy recovery of corporate NPA. Thus banks and financials helped the Indian market on Wednesday. The market was closed on Tuesday for a holiday.\n\nOn Tuesday, IMF\u2019s new MD Georgieva issued a \u2018guidance warning\u2019 by saying that the IMF may cut its global growth forecast further amid the synchronized global slowdown. Georgieva said effects of global slowdown more visible in India:\n\n\u201cIMF expects nearly 90% of the world is growing slower than a year ago and may lower global growth forecast next year. Trade conflicts could slash global GDP by 0.8% by 2020. Incrementally higher fiscal spending (stimulus) cannot work everywhere as global public debt remains near record levels. But German, the Netherlands and South Korea should increase spending on infrastructure. Any major downturn could put $19T in global corporate debt at risk of default -- 40% of the total in 8 major economies. The global economy is in the midst of a synchronized slowdown, effects of which have particularly been felt in countries such as India\u201d.\n\n\u201cDespite this overall deceleration, close to 40 emerging market and developing economies are forecast to have real GDP growth rates above 5 percent \u2014 including 19 in sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States and Germany, unemployment is at historic lows. Yet across advanced economies, including in the US, Japan and especially the euro area, there is a softening of economic activity. In some of the largest emerging market economies, such as India and Brazil, the slowdown is even more pronounced this year. In China, growth is gradually coming down from the rapid pace it saw for many years\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe precarious outlook presents challenges for countries already facing difficulties \u2014 including some of the Fund's program countries. Now is the time for countries with room in their budgets to deploy \u2014 or get ready to deploy \u2014 fiscal firepower. In fact, low-interest rates may give some policymakers additional money to spend. The right reforms in the right sequence could double the speed at which emerging markets and developing economies reach the living standards of the advanced economies. While the need for international cooperation is going up, the will to engage is going down\u201d.\n\nTrade is a case in point. And yet, we need to work together. From safely adapting to fintech to fully implementing the financial regulatory reform agenda, to fighting money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Climate change as a crisis where no one is immune and everyone has a responsibility to act. One of the IMF\u2019s priorities is to assist countries as they reduce carbon emissions and become more climate-resilient. But at the current average carbon price of USD 2 per ton, most people and most companies have a little financial incentive to make this transition. Limiting global warming to a safe level requires a significantly higher carbon price\u201d.\n\nIndia\u2019s Nifty tumbled last week on less dovish RBI rate cuts coupled with lingering shadow banking crisis:\n\nThe Indian stock market (Nifty) closed around 11126.40 Monday, slumped almost -0.43% on less dovish RBI rate cuts coupled with lingering shadow banking crisis and general economic slowdown despite fiscal deficit boost. Nifty tumbled almost -1.23% on Friday even after RBI cuts rate by -0.25% (as highly expected) as RBI slashed its forecast for FY-20 GDP growth sharply to +6.1% from the earlier projection of +6.9%. Overall, the RBI is now short of ammunitions after 5-consecutive times for a cumulative -1.35% in the last 7-8 months. Looking ahead, RBI may cut one again by -0.15% in Dec\u201919 to bring the RBI rate at +5.00%.\n\nBut the market is concerned about the ultimate effectiveness of RBI rate cuts due to very poor transmissions by the bank down the line. The market is also concerned more about the credibility of the Indian banking system marred with various lending frauds and issues of corporate governance.\n\nOverall, Nifty slips almost -2.93% last week and almost corrected 50% of the rally (around +10%) after the unexpected corporate tax cut fiscal stimulus boost as the market is now not so much optimistic about the actual benefit of corporate bottom line and ultimate boost to the subdued consumer spending amid the slowing Indian economy. The market is now looking for another fiscal stimulus as a \u2018Diwali Gift\u2019 to the nation by PM Modi in the form of personal tax cut/reform.\n\nThe Indian government may cut personal income tax to 0% for taxable income till Rs.5 lacs (present rate 5%), 10% for income above Rs.5 to Rs.10 lacs (present rate 20%), 20% for income above Rs.10 to Rs.20 lacs (present rate 30%), while the present rate of 30% on income above Rs.20 lacs to Rs.200 lacs will remain unchanged.\n\nThus the government may cut a 10% tax rate for a higher middle class earning group having a taxable income above Rs.5.00-20 lacs/PA. This category of earners in India would have disposable income for discretionary spending (in white money) and could boost consumer spending as DEMO almost destroy the black money/corruption oriented Indian high-value domestic consumption story and even business capex.\n\nThe economic cycle is taking its own time to rebuild wealth after the DEMO. India\u2019s NPA crisis also resurfaced at an alarming level just 2-year after DEMO as banks are now unable to evergreen the legacy NPA/corruption after the surgical strike on India\u2019s black/unaccounted money.\n\nBut there is little fiscal space and the Modi government is fiscally hawk/prudent. In other words, both the Indian government and central bank (RBI) is now increasingly out of ammunition to stimulate the economy.\n\nRBI believes in the government that there will be no additional fiscal deficit for the corporate tax cut fiscal stimulus announced, although it may cost Rs.1.45T (around $20B) per year as per the government\u2019s own estimate (for likely loss in corporate tax revenue). This means that either there will be no major tax revenue loss (because of various caveats to avail the complete benefit of the tax cut) or the government is quite confident to manage the fiscal deficit by higher revenue from other sources (like disinvestment, indirect taxes).\n\nAs the nominal GDP could be less than the budget estimate, the fiscal deficit (as a % of GDP) will bound to rise even if the absolute/nominal deficit remains at the budgeted levels. As there will be a higher probability of revenue collection miss in disinvestment and indirect taxes (amid volatile capital market, poor quality of PSUs/disinvestment candidates and slowing economy), the market is now quite skeptical about the ultimate benefit of corporate tax cut to the corporate bottom line.\n\nVarious corporates are now seeking tax cut clarifications, which clearly stated that to avail the facility, there would be no additional/special deductions. For example, a company can\u2019t claim any MAT credit for availing the new tax regime. For such credit or any other special deductions, they have to pay at the old rate (after availing deductions).\n\nThe recent NPA/corruption fiasco at PMC Bank and even Yes Bank indicates corporates-politicians nexus, corruption, and lack of corporate governance, regulatory supervision and credibility of auditors. The whole economy is running on currency leverage (huge devaluation) and most of the debt-heavy corporates are running like a great Ponzi scheme- like paying SBI credit card dues with PNB credit card.\n\nIt was almost unthinkable about the bankruptcy of groups like Reliance-ADAG, DHFL, India Bulls Housing, IL&FS, and Cox & Kings (to name a few) just a few years ago. Now the biggest concern in India is how RIL-MDAG could manage its huge debt of almost Rs.1.55T (almost $21.5B) despite Saudi Aramco\u2019s and BP\u2019s proposed deal (Rs.1.10T expected) and deleveraging (IPO listing) of R-JIO and R-Retail to make RIL debt-free by 31st March 2021. Saudi Aramco is itself struggling with its own listing/fundraising (IPO) as its owner (Saudi government/Royal Family) now desperately needs funds to sustain the Saudi economy and to invest in alternatives to fossil fuel as the world is shifting gear to non-polluted electric energy (vehicles).\n\nOn Friday (4th Oct), as highly expected, India\u2019s RBI cuts the main lending rate by -0.25% as highly expected to further slash the rate from prior +5.40% to +5.15%. But some market participants were also expecting a cut of -0.40% (the prior cut was unexpected -0.35%) to bring down the Indian rate to +5.00%. RBI cuts rate in Oct on account of slowing Indian economy as a result of Trump trade war uncertainty and synchronized global slowdown.\n\nBut India is mainly a domestic consumption-oriented economy. not a major export hub like China or even South Korea and thus least affected by the Trump trade war. Although almost 50% of Nifty earnings come from export (mainly IT services and RIL), the Indian IT/tech outsourcing industry is also least affected as Trump is too much pre-occupied with China. And India has its own advantage as IT outsourcing because of the skill, brain, and proficiency of the English language.\n\nIn any way, this is the record 5th consecutive times in the last 7/8-months that RBI cuts rate by -1.35%, whereas Indian banks have barely transmitted around -0.35% on a weighted average basis. Indian public sector banks (PSBs) are transmitting more than their private counterparts under government pressure to kick start lending in a big way. But there is little pick up in lending as there is a severe lack of eligible and quality borrowers, especially in the highly leveraged corporate sector. Also, there is a growing trend in MSME and retail NPA/NPL as the economy is slowing down considerably. Moreover, existing borrowers (2018 and prior) will have no benefit for RBI rate cuts in 2019.\n\nOn a question over RBI's stance on fiscal deficit after recent fiscal stimulus (corporate tax cut) announcement by the government, Das (RBI governor) said the central bank has enough trust in the credibility of the government over its fiscal discipline commitment. RBI believes that there will be no significant breach in the fiscal deficit target of 3.3%.\n\nOn the possible use of OMO (Indian version of QE-only government/GSEC bonds) to control surging bond yields as the market is quite concerned about fiscal deficit breach by the government significantly, Das said, OMO is the main tool, but there are also other tools like FX swap and term/temporary repo and RBI does not control bond yields, which are market-driven.\n\nOn a question about RBI\u2019s statement to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth (akin to ECB/Draghi stance) and whether RBI would like to go lower bound; i.e. cuts rate further considering the fact that GDP growth of 5.00-4.75% could be the base, Das was non-committal and said RBI will go by meeting-to meeting and as long as GDP growth does not revive/rebound, RBI will be in accommodative (cut) mode.\n\nOn the question of a report about government seeking an interim dividend from RBI for Rs.30B, which may a violation of the existing rule; Das denied the same as fake media news. On another question of cutting rate at -0.25% against some market expectations of -0.40% and the issue of insufficient rate cut transmissions by banks, hampering credit growth; Das said RBI now has to watch the impact of 135 bps cuts and the slew of fiscal stimulus by the government into the real economy in the days ahead before going for further rate actions.\n\nOn the question of India\u2019s shadow banking/NDFC/HFC/Co-operative bank crisis and lack of regulatory supervision, Das assured that the Indian banking sector is \u2018sound and stable and there is no reason for any unnecessary panic\u2019 and blamed \u2018rumors\u2019 for the unnecessary panic. But Das has no answer on lack/lapses of repeated regulatory supervision on banking/lending frauds be it in PNB or PMC. Das was asked about timely liquidity support of PMC Bank; Das said PCA is the first line of weapon.\n\nOn another question regarding the pending issue of the merger of Laxmi Vilas Bank with the India Bulls group, Das sounded evasive. On a question about the government\u2019s limited fiscal space after recent corporate tax cut fiscal stimulus and RBI role, Das said he strongly believes in government\u2019s commitment to the fiscal discipline.\n\nOn a question whether the Indian economic slowdown is a result of surging unemployment and low/nil real wage growth, Das basically said he has no idea (as In India, there is no regular data on unemployment and wage growth). On the question about poor rate cut transmissions by banks amid still high small savings rate and trajectory of Indian currency (INR), Das said small savings rate is under government prerogative and the government is aiming at gradual capital account convertibility.\n\nOn a question about only -0.25% cut against GDP downgrade of -0.80% and hidden NPA issue for PMC Bank for almost 8-years and lack of RBI supervision, Das again ducked but said over the last 8-9 months RBI has cumulatively cut by -1.35%. On appropriate regulatory supervision of India\u2019s banking system amid series of scams in the last few years (PNB, IL&FS, and PMC Bank), and especially cooperative banks, Das said RBI is taking appropriate action. On the concern of fiscal deficit breach after corporate tax cut fiscal stimulus and subsequent \u2018crowding out\u2019 (higher government borrowing in lieu of corporates) effect, Das basically downplayed the same. On India\u2019s alarming shadow banking crisis, Das said the central bank (RBI) is monitoring the situation very closely.\n\nOn the sole regulatory supervision of the cooperative banks in the aftermath of the PMC bank crisis, Das said RBI is with discussion with the government and waiting for the review process. On recent push by the government for the banks to organize \u2018Loan Fair\u2019 and possible risk thereby, Das said banks have to maintain \u2018prudent\u2019 lending norm. On the failure of past policy/initiative to convert cooperative banks to payment banks, Das said there are various issues, but the discussion process is going on with the government. On India\u2019s 26-years old deposit insurance scheme (RBI guarantee) in case of bank failures, RBI said there are various studies, but no final decision has been taken.\n\nOn India\u2019s NBFC/HFC (shadow banking) crisis related to underlying real estate sector stress and the subsequent effect on bond yields, Das said RBI is analyzing the situation as per financial stability report. On a recent surge in INR-NDF volume (offshore) and RBI stance to bring back onshore volume, Das said the government/RBI is analyzing the situation. On the government\u2019s plan to issue any sovereign/dollar bond, Das said it\u2019s under government prerogative. On any possibility of a merger of the PMC Bank with any other strong Bank in the aftermath of the recent NPA crisis (scam), Das said at present it\u2019s not on the card, but RBI is monitoring the situation closely.\n\nOn RBI\u2019s recent meeting with global investors (FPIs) for the inclusion of India bond in the global bond index, Das said it\u2019s an ongoing process. On RBI downgrade of India\u2019s GDP growth to +6.1% amid Trump trade war policies, Das said he is not so much concerned about the trade spat between India and the U.S. On the very poor transmission of RBI rate cuts by the banks to the borrowers so far, Das said the central bank is trying its best to ensure smooth and complete transmissions over a period of reasonable time. On RBI close supervision of India\u2019s 50 largest NBFCs for any default crisis, Das said RBI is closely interacting with the top management of those NBFCs if it found something wrong. On RBI\u2019s latest GDP growth and inflation forecast, Das said it was unanimous among RBI MPC.\n\nFinally, on growing panic among depositors to withdrawing money from various cooperative as-well-as private banks in the aftermath of PMC and Yes bank saga, Das/RBI finally reiterated both in English and Hindi that \u2018Indian banking sector is very sound and stable\u2019.\n\nAs a pointer, RBI tweeted on 26th Sep in the aftermath of PMC bank fiasco:\n\n\u201cReports appearing in some sections of social media about RBI closing down certain commercial banks are false.\u201d\n\n\u201cRumours are being circulated in sections of social media about operations of banks to create panic among the public. All are advised not to fall prey to such baseless and false rumors.\u201d\n\nFurther on 1st Oct, RBI again tweeted:\n\n\u201cThere are rumors in some locations about certain banks including cooperative banks, resulting in anxiety among the depositors. RBI would like to assure the general public that the Indian banking system is safe and stable and there is no need to panic on the basis of such rumors\u201d.\n\nLater, in the analysts\u2019 concall, RBI said it\u2019s open to the idea of liquidity management (squeeze) in the surplus situation. On one time restructuring of stressed loans for the real estate given by NBFC/HFC and allowing one large private sector Bank (Yes Bank) some exceptions to allow the quick raising of equity capital to support balance sheet, RBI said it will go by the rule book. On the present shadow banking crisis and stability of the Indian financial system, RBI played the old song and kicked the can down the road to the broad financial stability report. On any regulatory exception for India\u2019s Small Finance Bank (SFB) to get a universal banking license, RBI said everybody (entity) has to follow the rule book. But on any change in the RBI review process of NBFCs post fraud of PMC Bank, RBI has basically no specific answer.\n\nOn the present scenario of panic in the Indian money market; especially for below AAA companies to get funding RBI said its role is to provide sufficient liquidity in the market (at an affordable rate), but not to look after the quality of borrower; that\u2019s the prerogative of individual lenders. In other words, RBI will not bail out stressed NBFCs.\n\nOn a question, whether RBI is looking for another FX swap buy/sell window or any measure to bring swap cost lower to make hedging affordable and lucrative so that corporate (MSME) clients can tap global liquidity till PSU banks are still under deleveraging phase, RBI basically said \u2018no\u2019.\n\nOn the legacy issue of RBI\u2019s lack of forwarding guidance and subsequent flip-flops (consecutive rate cuts in 2019 just after rate hikes in 2018) and possible policy mistakes, RBI Governor Das basically pointed out that RBI has no such forward guidance or dot-plots like ECB or Fed. The market has to guess or find out from the MPC/MPR language. At present, RBI will be in \u2018accommodative stance\u2019 (rate cut mode) till GDP growth revives (take a definitive U-turn) and headline inflation (CPI) stays well below the RBI target of 4%. As RBI sees CPI well below its target of 4% till at least Q1FY21, there may be some policy space (to cut rates and boost consumer spending).\n\nOn any RBI plan to introduce mandatory external benchmark rate mechanism for India\u2019s shadow banks (NBFC/HFC/cooperative banks), RBI said currently there is no plan but for any plan, the shadow banking sector needs to be in proper order. On RBI research about transmission period to the real economy after a rate action (cut), RBI said it\u2019s between 2/4 to 8-quarters; i.e. 1-2 years. On any regulatory changes (LCR) for NBFC and whether there is any possibility of offering them a sustainable line of credit against G-Secs, RBI said it\u2019s still undecided.\n\nOn any update on the implementation of holding company structure for existing banking entities that have insurance and other subsidiaries underneath, RBI said the present rule continues to hold on. On a question about a specific private bank (Yes Bank) has seen a significant erosion of market cap which has impaired its capital raising ability, which could potentially hinder growth and could create a systemic concern if LCR depletes or CET-1 goes below regulatory threshold, RBI basically said they can\u2019t bail out such entity, although government/RBI will never allow a complete \u2018bankruptcy\u2019 for a bank, even if that is private, RBI said: \u201cI think we cannot discuss individual bank\u2019s responses\u201d.\n\nOn synchronized global easing (monetary) and any probability of synchronized global fiscal stimulus (Trump tax cut and Modi tax cut), RBI Governor Das said there is no such thing as synchronized global fiscal stimulus as each country has different policy space.\n\nOn a question, whether there is any risk of India getting into a stagflation situation in the next six months where growth becomes stagnant and inflation rises sharply due to higher food inflation as the food price cycle is turning around globally, RBI downplayed/trashed the stagflation scenario. RBI said GDP growth is expected to surge between +6.6% to +7.2% by H2FY20 from present +5.00%, while CPI would be well below the RBI target of +4.00%.\n\nFinally, on RBI projection of +6.1% GDP growth (from prior estimate of +6.9%) for FY20 and whether RBI cuts its GDP growth estimates further to the downside if the government does not announce corporate tax cut fiscal stimulus, RBI said the corporate tax cut fiscal stimulus is \u2018fiscally neutral\u2019 and hence this does not affect the GDP growth projection estimate materially from their part.\n\nOn last Friday (4th Oct), data shows that the Indian service PMI plunged to 19-months low at 48.7 in Sep from prior 52.4, lower than the expectations of 52.1 and deep into contraction zone, the steepest since Feb\u20192018 as new orders fell for the first time in one-and-a-half years and employment growth softened to the slowest since June, while backlogs fell for the first time in 40 months.\n\nMarkit said:\n\n\"The bad news of a cooling manufacturing sector was compounded by an outright services downturn in September. As a result, private-sector output in India contracted for the first time since February 2018. This reflected a decline in sales, albeit fractional, which restricted employment growth. Worryingly, business sentiment sank to a 31-month low\u201d.\n\n\"Policymakers will hope that monetary and fiscal stimuli can boost domestic demand as well as business investment, thereby restoring economic growth in the months to come. A drop in aggregate input cost inflation to its lowest in around three years raises the possibility of a further cut in the benchmark interest rate\u201d.\n\n\"When we look at the sub-sector data for the service sector, we can see diverging performances. Real Estate & Business Services and Finance & Insurance were the main sources of weakness, failing to record the growth of new orders and output. The other three segments continued to expand, but at softer rates than in August. Once again, Consumer Services was the best-performing category in September\u201d.\n\nBottom line:\n\nIndia is mainly a service-oriented economy and Markit clearly stated that the Indian service sector, especially financials, real estate, general business automobiles (service sector), which are now under severe stress. The Indian banking sector has long enjoyed high NIM and provided well-paid job opportunities despite such high NIM maybe also one of the primary reasons for today\u2019s NPA mess. Now, RBI rates are declining and RBI is pressuring them to lower/transmit rates, NIM is bound to be affected, especially at a time, when bond yields are not falling proportionately and small savings rates are still elevated. The possible squeeze in NIM and earnings may affect employment in this sector going forward.\n\nRBI, on its part, may cut another -0.15% in Dec\u201919 and then pause for some time to give emphasis on rate cut transmissions as it remains incomplete and staggered. There is a considerable policy transmission lag as only around 45 bps has been transmitted till now (taking SBI cut of 10 bps on 9th Oct) against 135 bps RBI cut in the last 8-months. Thus RBI may wait after Dec\u201919 to allow the rate cuts so far to work their way through the real economy before taking any further action; otherwise, there will be some risk of the aggressive dual stimulus (both monetary and fiscal), eventually transmitting into higher inflation and stagnated growth, resulting in stagflation. Overall, the market is now expecting another -0.50% cut by the RBI till Q1FY21.\n\nAs a pointer, the Indian 10Y bond yield surged to 6.68% from 6.60% after RBI\u2019s less dovish cut on 4th Oct. The historical spread between RBI repo rate and 10Y GSEC bond yield is around 100 bps. In that scenario, the 10Y GSEC bond yield should now hover around 6.00 to 6.15%; but that\u2019s not the case. The Indian bond yield jumped despite RBI rate cuts on the concern of higher fiscal deficits, higher government borrowings. Higher Indian bond yields are also making the cost of funds higher for the Indian banks, making rate cut transmissions even tougher apart from the main issue of higher deposit rate for various government-sponsored small savings instruments.\n\nIn India, the main problem for policymakers is that there is little leading economic data (like retail sales, unemployment, wage growth) to guide. The GDP growth and inflation data are also distorted and there is a large gap between them (headline CPI, core CPI, and GDP growth). This is a legacy problem despite the country has now good penetration of mobile, internet and UID cards. Modi government should ensure that Indian policymakers get reliable leading economic data so that they could formulate policy intending maximum employment and price (inflation) stability, the common goal for all the global central banks; otherwise it would be like driving without headlights in the night for the Indian policymakers and also politicians.\n\nThe Indian government/RBI should also ensure proper technology to integrate the entire banking system with RBI so that RBI could detect any banking/financial scams at an early stage before it becomes too big to shake the entire financial system of the country.\n\nOverall, apart from various shadow banking related frauds, lack of regulatory supervision and corporate governance, the Indian market is subdued despite corporate tax cut stimulus, because in reality, there are significant confusions and various conditions to avail those tax cut benefits. In any way, it may take time to be reflected in corporate earnings, higher capex, high wages for employees and reduced price of goods & services (if any) by a lag of 1-2 years.\n\nThe Indian government under PM Modi is also trying for some structural reform like a call to control surging Indian population growth (voluntarily), allowing semi-government/private companies (IRCTC) to run selected railways and putting an extra thrust of disinvestment of selected PSUs. But Modi-2 needs to reform personal income tax and also GST system (including petroleum products) along with lowering of interest rate on small savings scheme (for better rate cut transmission by banks) to boost consumer spending.\n\nBut India\u2019s growing issues of hidden NPA, corporate loan fraud, lack of adequate regulatory supervision and shabby corporate governance is now a grave concern for investor confidence despite the appeal of Modinomics, political stability and 4-D (demography, demand, deregulation, and democracy).\n\nTechnical View (Nifty, Bank Nifty, and USDINR-I):\n\nTechnically, whatever may be the narrative Nifty Future has to sustain over 11480 for a further rally to 11555*/11605-11650/11750* and further to 11805/11900-12000/12125* in the near term (under bullish case scenario).\n\nOn the flip side, sustaining below 11450-11430 Nifty Future may fall to 11380*/11290-11240/11180* and 11090*/11000-10950/10880* in the near term (under bear case scenario).\n\nTechnically, Bank Nifty Future has to sustain over 29350-29700 for a further rally 29875/29975-30200/30450 and 30575/30850-31100/31325 in the near term (under bullish case scenario)\n\nOn the flip side, sustaining below 29300-28950* Bank Nifty Future may fall to 28600/28400*-28100*/27600 and 27400/27100-26800/26600* in the near term (under bear case scenario).\n\nTechnically, USDINR-I has to sustain over 70.20 for a rebound to 70.95*/71.35-72.00/72.65* and further rally to 72.95/73.65-74.00/74.50 in the near term (under bullish case scenario)\n\nOn the flip side, sustaining below 69.95, USDINR may fall to 69.60/68.85*-68.25/68.00* and 67.35/66.90-66.25/66.00* in the near term (under bear case scenario).", "description": "Shares Analysis by Asis Ghosh covering: Nifty 50.
