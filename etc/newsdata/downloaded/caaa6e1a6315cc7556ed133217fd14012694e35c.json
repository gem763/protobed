She did not know what the future would hold, but she was certain it would be brighter.\n\nJuan Jose Granados Hernandez, a Venezuelan who lives in Buenos Aires, rides his bike in the capital city in Argentina September 4, 2019. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian\n\nPirrone, an employee at a pasta factory in Buenos Aires, is now feeling a sense of deja vu, as her adopted home teeters towards its own economic crisis, with inflation running at over 50% and the peso currency plunging amid default fears.\n\nArgentina\u2019s turmoil hits close to home for the South American country\u2019s extensive Venezuelan community, many of whom moved here to escape rising poverty, spiraling inflation and tight controls on currency and food.\n\n\u201cIt is not something I would like to go through again. I worked very hard to get my family out of there and now to have possibly brought them to the same situation is terrible,\u201d said Pirrone, whose mother and sister have since joined her in Argentina.\n\nShe said it would be complicated to leave Argentina but that she would consider it if things got worse, especially with a change of government likely towards the end of the year.\n\n\u201cI did not leave Venezuela to fall back into another type of similar government, so yes, I would leave.\u201d\n\nArgentina\u2019s center-right President Mauricio Macri was soundly beaten in a primary vote in August, making it highly likely that October\u2019s election will be won by the main Peronist opposition ticket, which includes divisive populist ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.\n\nArgentina, the No. 4 destination for Venezuelan migrants, has been in recession and firefighting economic crises since last year. The shock primary result sparked a further market crash, with the peso losing over a quarter of its value against the dollar in August alone.\n\nIn response, Macri rolled out plans to delay debt repayments and imposed capital controls to protect the peso. For some expatriate Venezuelans, that brought back reminders of home, which has long been under currency controls that many blame as the root causes of the country\u2019s economic malaise.\n\n\u201cReally, the first thing you think is to leave,\u201d said Alejandro Dugarte, an employee at a digital payments firm in Buenos Aires, who left Venezuela three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe already lived it. Living it again is not my plan,\u201d told Reuters from the living room of the Buenos Aires apartment he shares with his girlfriend, adding that he did not yet have concrete plans of where, when or even whether he would move.\n\nPARADISE VS CHAOS\n\nIn recent years, an estimated 4.3 million Venezuelans have fled an economic collapse in their home country that has fueled a humanitarian crisis and shortages of food and medicine. Most have scattered across South America.\n\nThe sound of Venezuelan salsa music and scent of arepa cakes grilling have become familiar to cities across the region, including Buenos Aires. Nearly 650,000 registered Venezuelan migrants have settled in Argentina in the last few years.\n\nJuan Jose Granados Hernandez said he sold eggs on his father\u2019s farm in Venezuela until the money no longer stretched to feed everyone at home. Now, he is a delivery cyclist for on-demand apps Rappi and Glovo in Buenos Aires.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is in total chaos. Here, it is still a paradise compared with Venezuela,\u201d he said, adding that Macri had \u201copened the doors\u201d to Venezuelans.\n\nFears of political upheaval, though, have spooked some Venezuelans. Fernandez de Kirchner, the vice presidential opposition candidate who led the country between 2007-2015, was once an ideological ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nHer running mate Alberto Fernandez has criticized regional demands for Maduro to step down and said if elected he would join Mexico and Uruguay in promoting talks between Maduro and the opposition.\n\nThat would represent a major policy shift that would end nearly four years of strident criticism of Maduro under Macri.\n\nMaduro has blamed Venezuela\u2019s economic woes on U.S. sanctions and said they have led some Venezuelans to try their luck in other countries, but that the extent of the crisis and number of migrants has been exaggerated.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nVenezuelans were wary of a return to Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s leftist policies because they had a \u201cfear and terror of everything that has to do with socialism,\u201d said Sofia Nunes, a Venezuelan journalist who has lived in Argentina for five years and works for local news site Urgente24. She has appeared on Argentine television criticizing the situation in Venezuela.\n\nShe said she had talked to her friends about leaving Argentina, but could not imagine rebuilding her life again.\n\n\u201cWhere would I go? To suffer again, where?\u201d she said.", "description": "Andreina Pirrone left Venezuela for Argentina six years ago as her country was spiraling towards the worst humanitarian crisis in its history.
