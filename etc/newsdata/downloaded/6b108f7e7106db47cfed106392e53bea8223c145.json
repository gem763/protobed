The market was expecting payrolls to have risen 160,000, according to economists\u2019 forecasts compiled by Investing.com.\n\nThe unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%, suggesting that the economy remains close to full employment.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose 0.4% in the month and 3.2% from the year-ago period. That was a little stronger than expectations for a monthly increase of 0.3% and a 3.1% year-over-year rise.\n\nIn days past, such a report would leave the Fed with conflicting monetary policy indications.\n\nJob growth was weaker than the consensus. And \u201cmore that 20% of job gains (were) due to temporary hiring for 2020 census, with downward revision to previous two months,\u201d Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk tweeted.\n\nJune payroll gains were revised down 15,000 from to 178,000 from 193,000 and July was revised down 5,000 to 159,000 from 164,000 \u2013 a total of 20,000.\n\nIn addition, average monthly job growth for the first eight months of 2019 is 158,00, down from 233,000 in full-year 2018 and the 225,000 in the year-ago period, Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management, tweeted.\n\nThat weakness could support some easing of rates.\n\nYet, with wage growth beating forecasts, inflation hawks would probably lean more to tightening.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t normal times, as far as the Fed is concerned.\n\nAnd if anyone needed a reminder, President Donald Trump tweeted before the release of the numbers, again demanding rate cuts and criticizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (This came a day after Trump tweeted about \u201cgreat\u201d jobs numbers from ADP (NASDAQ: ) and might have tipped those watching that the headline number would arrive below expectations.)\n\nThe Fed \u201cwere WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut\u201d he tweeted, and added \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome?\u201d\n\nThe markets seem pretty sure that nothing has really changed from yesterday and that Trump will get his cut at the FOMC meeting later this month.\n\nFed fund futures are pricing in a 92% chance of a quarter-point cut, just a tad lower than when the jobs report came out, according to Investing.com\u2019s .\n\nThe was flat in early trading.\n\nAnd the yield edged up 0.005 percentage point to 1.570%", "description": "Jobs Report Little Help to Fed as Trump Keeps Shouting for Cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC140QN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
