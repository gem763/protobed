So starting with the question What\u2019s Down There? seemed a very good place to begin the conversation about the female body and introduce the correct names for the vulva and vagina.\n\n\u2018The words penis and testicles appear in That\u2019s My Willy (penis also features in What\u2019s Down There).\n\n\u2018And while the characters in the book for girls start out questioning, they all end the book understanding and using the words vulva and vagina correctly.\u2019\n\nAlex Waldron, author of the Fred & Woody books series added: \u2018I wrote That\u2019s My Willy to teach my sons about the appropriateness of when and where they can explore themselves and to instil in them the idea that it\u2019s their body and they get to choose who gets to see or touch it.\n\n\u2018The \u2018That\u2019s My Willy\u2019 line is a fun, repetitive shout on each chorus encouraging kids to join along.\n\n\u2018With What\u2019s Down There? I wanted to deal with the same topics for girls but address the issue of the \u2018correct\u2019 terminologies.\n\n\u2018Confusion between the names vulva and vagina is current at the moment and it was an opportunity to insert the right names early on for a preschool audience within the story of the book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Through the guidance of Mandy Lancaster and my publisher (Ruby Tuesday) we did the same with the boys\u2019 book, making sure penis and testicle were used in the text.\u2019\n\nMORE: Does that pomegranate cutting hack actually work?\n\nMORE: Bride ties the knot wearing a wedding dress made of patches crafted by friends and family\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Books by Alex Waldron critcised for covers that say 'That's My Willy' for boys but 'What's Down There' for girls.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91172535_1571755145.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
