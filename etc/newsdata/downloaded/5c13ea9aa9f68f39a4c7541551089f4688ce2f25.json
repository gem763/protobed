By making his legacy all about Trump, we fail him again", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic Congressman and celebrated civil rights leader Elijah Cummings died early Thursday morning, October 17th. His last days were spent at a hospice center in Baltimore, where he was receiving care for \u201ccomplications concerning long-standing health challenges,\u201d his office said in a statement. Cummings was 68.\n\nIn the wake of his death, many media outlets linked the Congressman to President Donald Trump in headlines and content \u2014 either focusing on Cummings\u2019 strong opposition to his presidency, his role in the impeachment inquiry against Trump, or Trump\u2019s racist and derogatory attacks on Cummings. In one headline, The Daily Beast referred to the Congressman as a \u201cTrump foil.\u201d Most of these stories mention Cummings\u2019 love and advocacy for his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, while also focusing on the fact that President Trump once referred to Baltimore \u2014 a nearly 65 per cent black city \u2014 as a \u201cdisgusting, rat- and rodent-infested mess.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, it is necessary to speak about these topics. The country deserves to know what impact Cummings\u2019 death will have on the impeachment inquiry, for instance. And Trump should not be able to praise Cummings on this day while escaping accountability for his past comments.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut for many black people, it is depressing to see Elijah Cummings\u2019 death linked to his response to Trump\u2019s chaos. For us, he was so much more than that. Furthermore, the focus on Trump after Cummings\u2019 death is a painful reminder of the way our black elders are denied the rest they deserve in death.\n\nThe son of black sharecroppers, Elijah Cummings spent his last days fighting for justice in the midst of one of the most racist, corrupt presidential eras this young country has seen in recent years. But his work was more than just fighting against the current evil in our office. He was a Howard graduate, an experienced lawyer, and the holder of 12 honorary doctoral degrees. And he was more than even this labor, also. He was a father, and a husband, and a friend \u2014 not merely a \u201cTrump foil.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Trump isn\u2019t worthy of the focus he\u2019s receiving today. While Cummings was studying to become a lawyer to help his community, Trump was being sued for discriminating against black tenants. When Cummings was first elected to the House of Representatives, Trump was allegedly assaulting a magazine columnist in a department store fitting room. Trump is a man who has accomplished nothing. Nothing but bigotry and discord.\n\nOne way that black people are dehumanized in death is when others reduce our worth to the fervor with which we fought our enemies, without reflecting on the brokenness of a society that forced us to fight so fervently.\n\nIn a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Cummings as the House of Representatives\u2019 \u201cNorth Star.\u201d Pelosi went on to say that Cummings \u201cwas a leader of towering character and integrity, whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose\u2026 he dedicated his life to advancing the values that safeguard our republic: justice, equality, liberty, fairness.\u201d\n\nElijah Cummings spent almost his entire life fighting white supremacy. But in his last days, he was denied the peace he deserved.\n\nIn this way, our society failed him. They promised him that the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice, but allowed the universe to regress and entrench itself deeper into evil.\n\nYes, he should have been resting in his last days, but instead he was fighting Trump. The least we can do is not make Trump the focus of his legacy.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s hearing before Congress, Cummings addressed him and said: \u201cWhen we\u2019re dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?\u201d\n\nTo keep our democracy intact, I want to see our political leaders \u2013 especially our white political leaders \u2014 work to ensure that the next black elder, the next giant of the civil rights movement, is not forced to pass into the next world under the spectre of impending fascism. I don\u2019t want to see the same evil that beat them with sticks, chased them with dogs, barred them from voting follow them into their obituary.\n\nI don\u2019t want to see them forced to share headlines honoring their memory with the bigot who verbally abused them and terrorized their communities.", "description": "Democratic Congressman and celebrated civil rights leader Elijah Cummings died early Thursday morning, October 17th.
