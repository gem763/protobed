Like any negotiation with the EU, and in fact with any major negotiation in life, everything happens at the last minute.\n\n\u201cThis was always going to be both complicated and come down to the final hours and days, so this doesn\u2019t surprise me. We are going to work round the clock to try to secure it.\u201d\n\nMr Rinne\u2019s comments came as negotiators stepped up efforts to work out a way to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the contingency measure to prevent a hard border on the island.\n\n\u201cI think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU Council meeting. We need more time,\u201d Mr Rinne said during a Helsinki press conference, in remarks reported by Reuters.\n\nA Cabinet briefing on Brexit was understood to have been postponed by Mr Johnson as negotiators continued talks to hammer out a new deal ahead of the October 31 deadline.\n\nTuesday\u2019s planned update to senior ministers was said to have been delayed until Wednesday so he can give more detailed information on efforts to strike a new agreement.\n\nThe PM has been under increasing pressure to concede greater ground to Brussels, with reports suggesting the UK has dropped a demand that a deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly on customs arrangements.\n\nIrish deputy premier Simon Coveney raised some hopes by saying \u201ca deal is possible\u201d, maybe even this week, but stressed \u201cwe\u2019re not there yet\u201d.\n\nSimon Coveney (Rebecca Black/PA)\n\nIn similar comments, Mr Johnson told senior ministers there was \u201cstill a significant amount of work to get there\u201d but a \u201cpathway\u201d to a deal was still visible.\n\nThe two-day EU summit is crucial because the PM must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.\n\nThe Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to a no deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article 50 if MPs do not back a deal by then.\n\nThere are fears that a loophole could be used to avoid this, with the PM repeatedly ruling out making the extension request under his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to get Brexit done by the Halloween deadline.\n\nLeader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested the Government could use European law to achieve no deal.\n\n\u201cTheresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,\u201d he said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour.\n\nLabour has threatened court action to force the PM to obey the legislation.\n\nRegardless of the outcome in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday \u2013 the first in 37 years \u2013 if MPs approve the unusual move.\n\nThey will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next in the Brexit saga.", "description": "Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said a `great deal\u00b4 of progress has been made and negotiators are working `very intensively\u00b4.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/wire-19715158-1571094243-262_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
