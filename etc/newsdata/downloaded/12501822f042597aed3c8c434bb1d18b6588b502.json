Jim Jordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, laid out the ways the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry is not being done in a non-partisan way or following precedent from previous inquiries.\n\nThe inquiry is investigating President Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president and his push to have the country investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over allegations of corruption in exchange for military aid.\n\n\"Look, this is an unfair partisan process being run by Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff trying to impeach the president of the United States 13 months before an election, based an on anonymous whistleblower with no firsthand knowledge, whose biased against the president, who worked with Joe Biden, who did a memo the day after the phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky,\" Jordan told Fox News on Monday.\n\nBecause of the way Rep. Schiff (D-CA) is running the inquiry, Republicans are planning on voting to censure the House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\n\"We can\u2019t see the transcripts. He selectively leaks part of the transcripts and oh, in the interviews, no White House lawyers can be there. No agency lawyers can be there. The State Department can\u2019t have lawyers there. The minority isn\u2019t given subpoena authority. We can\u2019t get the witnesses we may want to call to get the information for the American people,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"And most importantly, it\u2019s all being done in the basement of the capitol where no one in the country can see based on an anonymous person that only Adam Schiff and his staff know who this guy. The rest of the 300-plus million people in this country have no idea who the individual is who started this whole darn thing,\" he added.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:19:06AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/294/c769e6c1-ed46-4127-afda-cb68da276ecb.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
