After opening slightly higher, the index tumbled on reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will announce she is directing an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.\n\nStocks then pared some of their losses after Mr. Trump said he would release a transcript of a call with the Ukrainian president that has come under fire in recent days. Reports have suggested Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe Dow industrials fell 142.22 points, or 0.5%, to 26807.77. The S&P 500 dropped 25.18 points, or 0.8%, to 2966.60, as nine of its 11 sectors slumped. Only the consumer staples and utilities sectors -- both of which are seen as safety plays -- held on to gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 118.84 points, or 1.5%, to 7993.63.\n\nEnergy stocks were the biggest decliners in the session, falling 1.6% as oil prices also dropped. Oil has been on a wild ride since attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities earlier this month sent prices soaring.\n\nTuesday was one of the most volatile sessions for stocks in weeks. The S&P 500 averaged daily moves of 0.2% in each of the previous two weeks. Even with Tuesday's decline, the broad stock-market index is up 18% for the year and less than 2% below its July record.\n\nThe market seems like it needs some incremental positivity to push through and reach new highs, and we haven't seen that yet,\" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager with Globalt Investments.\n\nMeanwhile, new data on consumer confidence and manufacturing added to the downbeat sentiment, intensifying worries that economic weakness elsewhere in the world could spread to the U.S.\n\nInvestors have cited strong consumer confidence as a bulwark supporting the U.S. economy, so the Conference Board's announcement that its consumer confidence index had fallen in September -- and by more than economists expected -- chipped away at that reason for optimism. A gauge of softening manufacturing activity across mid-Atlantic states was a disheartening sign of weakness after overall U.S. industrial production rose in August.\n\nInvestors were also parsing the latest signals on the state of trade talks between the U.S. and China. President Trump delivered a rebuke of the World Trade Organization Tuesday and said he wouldn't accept a \"bad\" trade deal with China at an address before the United Nations.\n\nAlbert Brenner, director of asset allocation strategy at People's United Advisors, said the amount of uncertainty in the market has led the firm to reduce its position in U.S. stocks.\n\n\"If the market isn't confident, the possibility that there could be significant negative reactions to news, even if it's transitory, that could occur,\" Mr. Brenner said. \"We just don't think now is the time to be having extra money on the table in risk assets, and equities in particular.\"\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up less than 0.1%, following a session of gains in Asia. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 24, 2019 16:59 ET (20:59 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
