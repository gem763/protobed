It then took another 10 years to complete the major structural changes.\n\nMarie-Agn\u00e9s Poussier-Winsback, Vice-President of Normandy Regional Council, said: \"These works had two aims. Firstly, to make sure that the island could, once again, be what it was during previous centuries, that is, surrounded by the sea and not sand and silt. And secondly, to improve the way we manage tourism.\"\n\nThe main work undertaken was the removal of the concrete causeway. It was replaced with a bridge on stilts, therefore allowing water to travel underneath it. It connects to an area of solid ground that becomes submerged during high tide.\n\nThe old dam on the Couesnon was also demolished, and replaced with a new eight-gated structure that regulates the flow between the river and the sea, which meet in the bay.\n\nRomain Desgu\u00e9e, who manages the new dam, explained to Euronews how it works.\n\n\"The old dam was there to limit flooding and marine flooding. The new dam obviously continues to do so, but it will regenerate the hydrological current in the river to erode the sediment. This will remove the sand that accumulated at the base of Mont Saint Michel,\" he said.\n\nTo complete this facelift, the car parks at the foot of the island have been removed, and it can now only be reached by a free shuttle bus, horse-drawn carriage, or by foot.\n\nMore than 2.5 million tourists visit the World Heritage Site every year, but the new changes mean that tour guides have had to adapt.\n\nHugo Poulet, a guide for Les Chemins de la Baie, visits the bay several times a day with groups of tourists. He said that the structural changes have had an effect on his work.\n\n\"Since the works have finished, the ground level has dropped, the sea is moving faster and now we have the Cuesnon passing on each side. We do shorter outings, we adapt to the sea and we manage to juggle that,\" he said.\n\nThe project cost a total of \u20ac184 million. Of that, \u20ac85 million was funded by the French government, and \u20ac21.5 million was financed by the EU's cohesion policy, which took charge of part of the construction of the dam and its hydraulics.", "description": "After around 20 years of research and construction work, Mont Saint Michel has recovered its isolated character, thanks to a new dam and footbridge.", "authors": ["Alfie Tobutt"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/79/12/64/1000x563_cmsv2_b58d2b9e-edd3-513d-b306-d2877a191fe8-3791264.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-16"}
