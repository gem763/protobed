Afterwards, many Labour MPs who wanted an unambiguous pro-Remain stance were more pessimistic than ever about the party\u2019s chances of winning an election, or even coming close.\n\nLabour\u2019s Remainers will fight on, saying that pressure to overturn the conference policy will only continue to build in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and shadow cabinet. They hope it will be tweaked when the election manifesto is eventually decided. But I suspect that now he\u2019s cleared the conference hurdle, Corbyn\u2019s \u201call things to all people\u201d approach will prevail.\n\nHis allies claim that Remainers refuse to take Yes for an answer. Indeed, a year ago, they would have given their left arm for a cast iron pledge of a Final Say referendum with an option to Remain; now, Labour\u2019s centre of gravity has forced Corbyn to give up his anti-referendum position. But he has stuck stubbornly to keeping Leave in the frame so that Labour can \u201cunite the country\u201d \u2013 and, crucially, so it can appeal to the Leave voters Boris Johnson is eyeing in the North and Midlands\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

MPs fear a repeat of the European Parliament elections in May, where Labour fell between the two stools of a polarised country and was roundly beaten into a poor third place. As one said: \u201cWe will go into a Brexit election saying \u2018we\u2019ll tell you what we think about Brexit when it\u2019s over.\u2019 It\u2019s nonsense, and not credible.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

New YouGov polling for the People\u2019s Vote campaign shows that only 14 per cent of Labour\u2019s Remain voters would \u201cdefinitely not\u201d vote for the Lib Dems, with only 9 per cent spurning the Greens. In contrast, the risk of losing Leave voters is lower: 72 per cent of Labour Leavers would definitely not back the Tories, and 48 per cent reject the Brexit Party.\n\nOpinium found for the first time that Remainers are just as likely to vote for the Lib Dems as Labour (33 per cent for each). Labour has already lost one in four of the voters who backed it in 2017 to the Lib Dems or Greens.\n\nCorbyn allies point out that Theresa May wanted a Brexit election in 2017, but it turned on other issues such as austerity. Yet the game has moved on, and surely the coming contest will be dominated by Brexit. When Channel 4 News asked voters last week how they would vote in the election, they found that people responded \u201cLeave\u201d and \u201cRemain\u201d rather than named a party.\n\nIt is true that Labour can borrow from the traditional Lib Dem playbook and tailor their message to fit different constituencies. Remainer Labour MPs can claim they would stop Brexit via a referendum; Leavers can say Corbyn will negotiate a better Brexit than the Tories.\n\nBut coupled with his disastrous personal ratings, Corbyn\u2019s neutral stance on the election\u2019s critical issue might simply look like weakness. He doesn\u2019t even intend to take sides in a referendum. As prime minister, he would allow cabinet ministers to campaign for Remain or Leave while keeping his hands clean to honour the result either way.\n\nThis raises the prospect of Sir Keir Starmer negotiating a soft Brexit deal with the EU which he has already pledged to campaign against, along with other senior figures such as John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Emily Thornberry. No wonder there are doubts at the highest level of the shadow cabinet about the policy backed by the conference.\n\nOne crumb of comfort for Labour\u2019s pro-Europeans is that they are confident the party will finally come out for Remain when it holds the now-mooted special one-day conference to decide whether to recommend a Labour deal or Remain in the referendum.\n\nBut that could be academic, as it will come after an election that has just got more difficult for Remainers to win. The decision Labour just took will likely make it harder for Remainers to organise tactical voting at the local level. Their fear is that the split in the Remain vote, notably in Conservative-Labour marginals, will ultimately help one man most: Boris Johnson.", "description": "To get his way at Labour conference, Jeremy Corbyn\u00a0had to turn his showdown with Labour Remainers at his party's conference into a loyalty test.
