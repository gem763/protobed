Defense Iran dismisses U.S. allegation it was behind Saudi oil attacks\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Iran denied on Sunday it was involved in Yemen rebel drone attacks the previous day that hit the world\u2019s biggest oil processing facility and an oil field in Saudi Arabia, just hours after America\u2019s top diplomat alleged that Tehran was behind the \u201cunprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\nThe attacks Saturday claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels resulted in \u201cthe temporary suspension of production operations\u201d at the Abqaiq processing facility and the Khurais oil field, Riyadh said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, authorities said while pledging the kingdom\u2019s stockpiles would make up the difference. The amount Saudi Arabia is cutting back is equivalent to over 5% of the world\u2019s daily production.\n\nWhile markets remained closed Sunday, the attack could shock world energy prices. They also increased overall tensions in the region amid an escalating crisis between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nLate Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo directly blamed Iran for the attack on Twitter, without offering evidence to support his claim.\n\n\u201cAmid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d Pompeo wrote. \u201cThere is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\u201d\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Those militias in recent weeks have been targeted themselves by mysterious airstrikes, with at least one believed to have been carried out by Israel.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed Pompeo\u2019s remarks as \u201cblind and futile comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans adopted the \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning towards \u2018maximum lies\u2019,\u201d Mousavi said in a statement.\n\nSeparately, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s office issued a statement on Sunday denying the drone attack came from there.\n\nIraq \u201cabides by its constitutions that prevents the use of its lands to launch aggressions against neighboring countries,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFirst word of Saturday\u2019s assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nMachine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day\u2019s first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom\u2019s defense, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is \u201cwilling and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,\u201d according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.\n\nSaudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as \u201cthe largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world.\u201d\n\nThe facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July.\n\nThe Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.\n\nThere was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel.\n\n", "description": "\u201cThe Americans adopted the \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning towards \u2018maximum lies\u2019.\u201d", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0d/4f/58769b5a4019a7256a51255642b3/webp.net-resizeimage%20(19).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
