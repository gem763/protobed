The Nintendo Switch certainly is. So you can\u2019t blame Nintendo for wanting to bring a bunch of games that a lot of people missed on the former over to the latter.\n\nFrom Mario Kart to Captain Toad, the Switch is now home to a sizeable Wii U Catalogue In Exile, with an increasing number of Nintendo-published titles having made the jump.\n\nTo give you an idea of just how many Wii U ports have been shuffled over since the Switch\u2019s release in 2016, here\u2019s a list of every game Nintendo published for the Wii U.\n\nThose that have been ported to the Switch \u2014 or at least been announced \u2014 are in bold.\n\nBayonetta\n\nBayonetta 2\n\nCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker\n\nDevil\u2019s Third\n\nDonkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze\n\nDr. Luigi\n\nFatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water\n\nGame & Wario\n\nHyrule Warriors\n\nJust Dance Wii U\n\nKirby and the Rainbow Curse\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD\n\nLego City Undercover\n\nMario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games\n\nMario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games\n\nMario Kart 8\n\nMario Party 10\n\nMario Tennis: Ultra Smash\n\nMario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars\n\nMini Mario & Friends: Amiibo Challenge\n\nNES Remix\n\nNES Remix 2\n\nNES Remix Pack\n\nNew Super Luigi U\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. U\n\nNinja Gaiden 3: Razor\u2019s Edge\n\nNintendo Land\n\nPaper Mario: Colour Splash\n\nPikmin 3\n\nPok\u00e9mon Rumble U\n\nPokk\u00e9n Tournament\n\nPushmo World\n\nSing Party\n\nSplatoon\n\nStar Fox Guard\n\nStar Fox Zero\n\nSuper Mario 3D World\n\nSuper Mario Maker\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Wii U\n\nTokyo Mirage Sessions \u266fFE\n\nWii Fit U\n\nWii Party U\n\nWii Sports Club\n\nThe Wonderful 101\n\nXenoblade Chronicles X**\n\nYoshi\u2019s Woolly World\n\n* - Not technically a port, but close enough** - It\u2019s a port of a Wii game, not a Wii U game, but I\u2019ll count it\n\nWhen you look at the big first-party releases for the Wii U that stood alone, so many of them have been ported, from Mario Kart to New Super Mario Bros and even Captain Toad. Pretty much the only games that really stand out here as not having been ported are Super Mario 3D World and Pikmin 3.\n\nAnd maybe the Zelda ports if you\u2019re getting fussy.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of re-releasing, more than even Sony and friends have pulled on the PS4 with ports like The Last Of Us and Shadow of the Colossus. And while it\u2019s easy to label a practice like this as a shameless money grab, I think when it comes to Nintendo and the Wii U there\u2019s probably also a humbling practicality at play where the company figures, you know what, the Wii U bombed so hard a lot of people never got a chance to play these great games.\n\nNow that the Switch is doing great, maybe we can push them out once more and give them a second chance.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this list going forwards, because there\u2019s no way Nintendo don\u2019t have more ports planned.\n\nOh, and before we go, check out Kohler\u2019s 2017 predictions on which Wii U games did and didn\u2019t deserve a port, in which he absolutely nails Mirage Sessions, but like most folks never saw Captain Toad coming.", "description": "The Wii U wasn\u2019t exactly a raging success.
