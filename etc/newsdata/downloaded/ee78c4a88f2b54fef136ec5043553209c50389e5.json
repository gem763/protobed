Elizabeth Warren has come a long way in the polls since the early days of her 2020 presidential campaign. Back in April, she was polling in the mid single digits nationally, but she now leads a number of national and early-state polls. And based on polls from September and August, Warren has expanded her support in a few overlapping directions \u2014 making inroads with groups and categories of voters she was previously struggling with. The result is that she is now positioned as the leading alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Here\u2019s a look at where Warren has made inroads, so far:\n\nWarren is appealing to more moderate voters now, too\n\nAlong with Sen. Bernie Sanders, Warren has long been a favorite among more liberal voters. And since June, she\u2019s actually been the top choice among very liberal voters, according to polling from Quinnipiac University. Now, however, there\u2019s evidence she\u2019s picking up support from more moderate voters, too. In the latest Quinnipiac national survey, Warren not only inched ahead of Biden in overall support from Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents, 27 percent to 25 percent, but she also beat him for the first time in Quinnipiac\u2019s polling among somewhat liberal voters, capturing 30 percent of that group to Biden\u2019s 19 percent. (She was also the clear second choice among moderate or conservative voters, although Biden still had a 10-point lead there.)\n\nEarlier in September, I wrote that it was good for Warren that she was doing so well among very liberal voters, but that it probably wasn\u2019t enough to carve out a path to the nomination as the Democratic Party is roughly evenly split between liberals and moderates. But now, it seems as if Warren\u2019s appeal is broadening beyond her ideological base of very liberal supporters.\n\nQuinnipiac isn\u2019t the only pollster who found this, either. Monmouth University\u2019s September national survey found that Warren led with 37 percent of the vote from liberal voters and was also in second place among moderate or conservative respondents with 20 percent support \u2014 10 points behind Biden\u2019s 30 percent. This marked an uptick of 4 percentage points among these moderate or conservative voters since Monmouth\u2019s August poll. Additionally, the latest YouGov/Economist national poll pegged Warren as the first choice for 15 percent of moderates \u2014 some distance behind Biden\u2019s 30 percent, though still in second place. But this was still about twice the level of Warren\u2019s support among moderates in late August.\n\nWarren is finally starting to make inroads with voters without a college degree\n\nFor the past couple of months, Warren has been the leading candidate for college-educated voters, particularly white ones, but there are now signs she\u2019s garnering support from voters who aren\u2019t college educated, too. This is important for Warren because a plurality of Democratic voters are white voters without a college degree, and they currently form a key constituency for Biden and Sanders. And in Quinnipiac\u2019s latest survey, Warren had 26 percent support among non-college whites, which put her in a near-tie with Biden at 27 percent and ahead of Sanders\u2019s 19 percent. By comparison, in Quinnipiac\u2019s late-August survey, Warren had 20 percent to Biden\u2019s 30 percent among non-college whites and was roughly tied with Sanders, who had 19 percent support among that group.\n\nFox News also found a slight improvement in Warren\u2019s support among white voters without a college degree in its September survey: 19 percent support, compared to 15 percent in August, and she now sits just 5 percentage points behind Biden. Granted, these aren\u2019t huge shifts we\u2019re talking about \u2014 and we should be cautious with reading too much into the crosstabs because they have larger margins of error than the overall sample \u2014 but the trend has been consistent across a number of recent polls. Monmouth also found Warren\u2019s support among voters (of all races) without a four-year degree went up from 17 percent in August to 24 percent in late September.\n\nAnd if Warren is gaining among white voters who don\u2019t have a college degree, it\u2019s likely to the detriment of Biden and Sanders, who are the only other candidates who get at least double-digit support from this group. This is especially important in light of the fact that Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the Democratic primary, are predominantly white and, as a result, have a large share of white voters without a college degree. In fact, if we look at Democratic primary exit polls from 2016, half of Iowa caucus-goers weren\u2019t college graduates, and 40 percent of New Hampshire primary voters fell into that category as well. So if Warren can keep improving her standing among whites without a college degree, it could help her chances in the first two contests, which could potentially catapult her to outright front-runner status early in 2020.\n\nWarren is also winning over voters who aren\u2019t white\n\nArguably the biggest threat to Warren\u2019s chances at the nomination has been just how white her support is. She has consistently had low support among nonwhite voters, especially African Americans, who make up anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of the Democratic electorate. But polls now suggest Warren may be, at last, gaining traction. Quinnipiac\u2019s past two national polls showed Warren\u2019s support among black voters nearly doubled from 10 to 19 percent, and the most recent YouGov/Economist survey found her at 15 percent among African Americans compared to 9 percent in its final August poll. And Monmouth\u2019s late September survey found her at 20 percent among nonwhites more broadly, up from 14 percent in August.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that Fox News\u2019s August (13 percent) and September (11 percent) surveys showed virtually no change in Warren\u2019s support among nonwhites. And though she might be eating into Biden\u2019s support elsewhere, two new polls in South Carolina show Biden doing far, far better than Warren among black voters. A Winthrop University poll found Biden winning 46 percent of black voters to Warren\u2019s 9 percent, while a Fox News survey had Biden at 50 percent compared to Warren\u2019s 8 percent among that group. So while Warren has started to make inroads among nonwhite voters, we shouldn\u2019t rush to overstate her improvement. She still has plenty of work to do to expand her support.\n\nWarren is also maybe winning over some former Harris backers\n\nThis theory may be on less solid footing than the other ones I\u2019ve floated so far, but I venture that at least some of Warren\u2019s gains have come at the expense of Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s support, too. If we look at the last two months of national polls and split them into three different periods (each spanning three weeks) and calculate the polling average for Warren and Harris using polls from pollsters with at least a B- rating, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, you can see Warren and Harris have pretty clearly moved in opposite directions. Warren has moved from the mid-teens to the low 20s, while Harris has fallen from the high single digits to just the mid single digits.\n\nAnd one reason to think that some of Harris\u2019s supporters have moved into Warren\u2019s camp is that they have tended to name Warren as their top second-choice candidate. In part, this is probably because there is some demographic overlap in their support \u2014 both candidates have a fair amount of backing from college-educated voters and more progressive voters.\n\nTo be clear, Biden is still leading in the polls, but the distance between him and Warren has narrowed considerably. And so while we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on how things develop, it does seem like Warren has improved her position from where it was in April. She has done this, in part, by starting to build support from a broader coalition that includes more moderate voters, less-educated voters and some nonwhite voters, as well as some voters who supported Harris earlier in the campaign. There\u2019s still a lot of progress left for Warren to make, particularly among voters of color, but for now, her trajectory for the 2020 Democratic nomination is moving in the right direction \u2014 up.", "description": "It seems as if Warren\u2019s appeal is broadening beyond her ideological base of very liberal supporters.", "authors": ["Geoffrey Skelley"], "top_image": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1171198260_16x9.jpg?w=575", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
