The company is confident it can agree a solution for the whole group, but landlords complain they have been kept out of the loop.\n\nOne said: 'The frustration that some of us have felt is with the lack of information flow.\n\n'Landlords have tried to engage and there have been a number of restructurings suggested in the past, but nothing has been agreed. They are coming to us with no clear picture of what Four Seasons is going to look like.'\n\nThe landlords are understood to include major funds such as a branch of US hedge fund Davidson Kempner and controversial investment firm Cerberus Capital Management, along with smaller property owners.\n\nCerberus, led by billionaire Donald Trump ally Stephen Feinberg, has been described by MPs as a 'hound of hell' for buying the debts of UK households from banks and driving them towards ruin.\n\nThe major landlords are understood to have contingency plans to replace Four Seasons with another operator, if talks fall apart. This should mean minimal disruption for residents.\n\nThough the management would change, they would remain in the same home with most of the same staff.\n\nHowever the future of residents living in care homes owned by smaller landlords, who do not have a contingency plan in place, could be more uncertain.\n\nFour Seasons says current rent levels are unsustainable, and is hoping to reach agreement with landlords over reduced rates.\n\nAn independent report found that the majority of Four Seasons' landlords are charging above market rate for the rent. They have raked in more than \u00a3100million over the past two years.\n\nMartin Healy, chairman of Four Seasons, said: 'Following the exchange of contracts with H/2 Capital, we have put in place a clear pathway to ensure continuity of care across the group and are confident of reaching consensual agreements on our leasehold properties.'", "description": "Four Seasons, which is the second largest care home operator in the UK and looks after 16,000 residents, stopped paying its landlords two weeks ago in order to pull them to the negotiating table.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
