Many others were injured, and the area around the future hotel remained evacuated Thursday as emergency workers were preparing to bring down a pair of unsecured cranes.\n\nGetting construction started took several years as the developers faced a variety of issues, including a jail sentence for one developer who was sentenced to prison for overbilling a government program. The lawsuit names the developers, architect, engineers and builders as defendants, accusing them of negligence.\n\nAttorneys Steve Herman and Rene Rocha, who are representing the victims, said in a statement, \u201cThe primary goal is to get to the bottom of exactly what happened, and make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\nCitadel Builders, the company which was building the development and which was named in the lawsuit, said in a statement on its website that it was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the deaths and \u201cgrateful\u201d that most of the injured have returned home.\n\nIn a statement about the collapse, Citadel touted its safety record and pledged that safety would remain a priority.\n\nWhile we don't yet know what caused the accident at the Hard Rock site, we would like our clients, friends, and the general public to rest assured that we are working with some of the finest engineering minds in the world and will get to the bottom of it,\" the company said.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the structure wasn\u2019t designed to bear the loads it was intended to hold, that concrete wasn\u2019t given enough time to cure and that unskilled and under-supervised labor was used.\n\n\u201cDelays, design changes and shortcuts created extra challenges to the project,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe developers were supposed to submit pile load tests to city planners showing the piles could hold 125 tons. But they instead submitted tests from a different project that had been tested for 50 tons, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe building also had an \u201cinsufficient\u201d number of supports, the suit claims. Workers reported that decking materials and supports were too thin.\n\nEven before the collapse, \u201cdips\u201d appeared in concrete decking on the upper floors, according to the lawsuit. That would indicate the concrete hadn\u2019t cured, the building was not secure or both. Workers also noticed support beams bowing and failing, but construction continued.\n\n\u201cThis major building collapse would not have occurred, but for the negligence and failures of the defendants,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Workers reported issues before the partial building collapse, according to the lawsuit.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/12/0/0/694940094001_6094398390001_6094394520001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
