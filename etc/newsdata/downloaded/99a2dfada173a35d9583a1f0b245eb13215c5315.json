Button of the Month is a monthly look at what some of those buttons and switches are like on devices old and new, and it aims to appreciate how we interact with our devices on a physical, tactile level.\n\nI think a lot about power buttons these days. With modern devices \u2014 especially smartphones \u2014 we don\u2019t really use them as power buttons, because our phones are never really off. But that\u2019s a double-edged sword, because while they don\u2019t actually \u201cpower\u201d on our phones, we press them more than ever: my iPhone X\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d button probably gets pressed dozens of times every day now.\n\nPower buttons are a subtle reflection of trends in modern technology\n\nAnd it\u2019s that iPhone power button that I specifically want to talk about: the one on Apple\u2019s most recent Face ID iPhones. When Apple killed the home button with the iPhone X, it also killed the hardware trigger for Siri \u2014 you can\u2019t press and hold a home button that doesn\u2019t exist, after all.\n\nPower buttons are a subtle reflection of trends in modern technology. When smartphones first came about, nearly every phone had a power button on top of the device. As screen sizes grew, and that top edge got farther and farther away from the reasonable reach of most thumbs, the power button migrated to the side. When screens grew larger and home buttons went extinct, the power button got built-in fingerprint sensors. And Apple is no different: the iPhone power button experiences the same trends.\n\nSo when Apple killed the home button, it changed two things about the power button, too. First, the power button on the iPhone X is twice as big as prior models, so it\u2019s always easy to press it. And it now activates Siri when held down, instead of offering the shutdown prompt (the other main function of the iPhone home button). Both of these shifts make sense, logically. iPhones were getting bigger, and making the button easier to press is a natural extension of that. And as the last major button left on the phone, having the power button trigger Siri was essentially the only option (short of adding some kind of dedicated Siri button, anyway).\n\nBut the side effect is that the power button on current iPhones can\u2019t actually do the one thing it\u2019s supposed to: actually turn the phone on and off (a separate command that requires holding it and the volume up button together is needed to actually shut the phone off entirely).\n\nIt was a frustrating change at first, but the difference is a positive one, I think. I use Siri for simple tasks like setting alarms and adding reminders to return Amazon packages far more than I did to turn off my phone. And putting that function in the power button \u2014 which I nearly always have a thumb on when holding my phone, even more so than the home button \u2014 makes it even more accessible. Plus, the bigger button is just more enjoyable to press, especially on brand-new devices when the click is still nice and crisp.\n\nSome Android phones are following this trend, too: the Note 10\u2019s power button doesn\u2019t shut off the phone, and OnePlus phones can be customized to launch Assistant with a short press.\n\nEven as we\u2019re starting to see phones that eschew buttons entirely, some kind of hardware to turn on a device is still needed. And as smartphones continue to get increasingly innovative and fresh designs, it\u2019s a safe bet that the power button will continue to change along with them.", "description": "I think a lot about power buttons these days.
