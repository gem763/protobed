If the weather affects the schedule on Saturday, leading to postponement, then we could see qualifying take place very early on Sunday morning UK time, as has happened in the past before in Japan.\n\nWill it be affected by Typhoon Hagibis?\n\nEngland's Rugby World Cup match against France has been cancelled because of Hagibis and there is a chance it will affect further games as well. It's no surprise, then, that it may affect Suzuka and the worst conditions are most likely to fall on Saturday.\n\nIt's possible that conditions in Mie Prefecture will make it either unraceable or be so bad as to endanger the safety of attendees and other personnel. It may be or rescheduled beforehand in that case, so stay tuned for updates. A decision may be made by Friday lunchtime UK time.", "description": "What is it?", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212565641-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLeUJvOJqnV613e1NxllMSd6BnMf0kzF1WPsn9AqaDz8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
