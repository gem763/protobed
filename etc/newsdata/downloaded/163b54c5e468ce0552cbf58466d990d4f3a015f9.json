But baked beans just seems like an impractical choice for the roads.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMaybe this was what caused someone to leave a tin wedged underneath their passenger seat, only to be found by a shocked webuyanycar.com buyer in Wrexham.\n\nEven more concerning was that the four-year-old tin was found three years into the ownership - meaning they\u2019d been chauffeuring the rotting beans around the entire time!\n\nA... blood transfusion machine?\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever misplaced something - be it a phone or a wallet - you will know that getting it back can feel like your life depends on it.\n\nWell, sometimes it just might. Sister company to webuyanycar.com, webuyanyvan.com, reported that one customer found a blood transfusion machine in their new purchase.\n\nWhile the device wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the back of an ambulance, the discovery was made in second-hand van bought in Coventry.\n\nBox of human ashes\n\nEarlier this year, a customer visited the Altrincham branch to sell his late father\u2019s car.\n\nWhen the car was later moved, the buyer was shocked to find that the customer had left behind a box - containing his father\u2019s ashes.\n\nThankfully, it didn\u2019t take long for the customer to be reunited with the ashes.\n\nAnother grave discovery was once made in Norwich, where a buyer found an order of service from the customer\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral.\n\nAn envelope with \u00a310,000 in cash\n\nNot all discoveries have to bad. Cash is one of the most common items to be mistakenly left behind in cars.\n\nThe biggest amount discovered to date is an impressive \u00a310,000, found in a large envelope beneath the passenger seat in Melksham.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this is one item the panicked customer did come back for.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHorse manure\n\nDriving through the countryside, it\u2019s not unusual to get some unwelcome scents wafting in through the windows from the fields.\n\nHowever, for one buyer in Falkirk, the source of the problem was much closer to home - when they discovered a bag of horse manure in their car.\n\nOther strange items that have been left behind in cars include:\n\nPack of 20 shotgun shells\n\nAn unused, boxed microwave\n\nAn ex-fiance\u2019s engagement ring, attached to the spare key\n\nAn inflatable man\n\nHead of technical services at webuyanycar.com, Richard Evans, said: \u2018we always strive to go above and beyond for our customers and sometimes this means reuniting them with some strange items that have been left behind in cars.\u2019\n\nWhile items left behind only get more bizarre, he added: \u2018One thing is always certain, no matter what your car may have been storing, we will be sure to buy it.\u2019", "description": "Buying a new car is very exciting, but imagine opening the boot and finding one of these bizarre items sitting waiting for you...", "authors": ["Thomas Amor", "Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20643175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Close-up-hand-male-giving-a-key-new-car-on-hand-female-outside-her-car-Concept-of-rent-car-or-buyin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
