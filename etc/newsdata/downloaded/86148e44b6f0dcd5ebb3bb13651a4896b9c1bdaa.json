That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all they\u2019ve gotta do. They\u2019ve gotta get on stage only when invited, perform whatever partway humiliating task is required of them, and leave the stage without managing to fuck the show or \u2013 god forbid \u2013 the star, up. Apparently though, that instruction wasn\u2019t transmitted to this bulky doofus who managed to drop himself and Lady Gaga off the stage in a scary tumble a short time ago.\n\nGaga is currently in Las Vegas performing a residency leg of her Enigma show at the Park MGM Theatre.\n\nDuring today\u2019s performance, she invited a rather meaty-looking fellow onto the stage where she proceeded to climb him like a tree.\n\nOnly problem there is that apparently one of said tree\u2019s trunks was about as sure-footed as a tumble dryer with a brick in it, because old mate managed to completely miss the edge of the stage, tumbling off it to the floor with Lady By-God Gaga still attached to him.\n\nCop this footage of it. That fall is rough.\n\nA fan picked up gaga and fell off the stage tonight???? pic.twitter.com/j9pjTUF64M \u2014 laurie calderone (@laur_calderone) October 18, 2019\n\nLady Gaga fell off stage tonight during Enigma ???? Thankfully, she is ok and continuing with the show #ENIGMA pic.twitter.com/tCNBJ4ZSD9 \u2014 Gaga Now ???? (@ladygaganownet) October 18, 2019\n\nJudging by that vision, the fan took the brunt of the impact square on his anoos, but jesus christ imagine being the idiot that manages to break Lady Gaga\u2019s back, for god\u2019s sake.\n\nEver the resilient type, Gaga apparently bounced back up and finished the rest of her set relatively unscathed.\n\nWhether the same can be said of the fan\u2019s clearly now-shattered tailbone remains to be seen.\n\nAgain: Do not drop the star of the show off the stage they\u2019re performing on. Under no circumstances should you do that.", "description": "A fan has somehow managed to drop Lady Gaga off a stage in Las Vegas in what looked like a pretty nasty fall.
