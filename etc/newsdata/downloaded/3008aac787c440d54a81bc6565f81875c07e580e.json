If you call us an enemy to the people, you\u2019re really playing with fire or something. That\u2019s total garbage. This is America. If you suck, you get criticized. Suck it up, you weak, soy boy buttercups. And we love it. We love it when President Trump calls you out on your nonsense\u2014and this weekend was quite the bonfire.\n\nThey tried to character assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh again. They just cannot stand that Trump won, that America won, and that baseless sexual misconduct allegations lost. It\u2019s too late. He\u2019s confirmed. He\u2019s on the court. And he\u2019s not going away. Elections have consequences and liberals need to understand that they\u2019re not entitled to win all of them.\n\nThe New York Times peddled a new accuser who, and get this, doesn\u2019t even remember that Kavanaugh ever allegedly assaulted her. It\u2019s similar to the accusation that Deborah Ramirez lobbed against Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. That a drunken Kavanaugh shoved his genitals in her face at a drunken college party at Yale. The Times piece rehashed the Ramirez story, but had this tidbit:\n\nWe also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez\u2019s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier; the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.\n\nIn the @nytimes Kavanaugh article, it says \"Two F.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Ramirez, telling her that they found her \u201ccredible.\u201d\"\n\n\n\n\"telling her\"\n\n\n\nSo it's Ms. Ramirez telling Times reporters that the FBI agents said she was \"credible\".https://t.co/iR11mDp2S4 pic.twitter.com/rGlUN1XGIH \u2014 Jeryl Bier (@JerylBier) September 16, 2019\n\nHow did the @nytimes editors fail to include the below info in their article re: Kavanuagh?

The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nSo, it\u2019s a nothing burger. It\u2019s another nothing burger. Another character assassination attempt and a warning from the Left that they will engage in the politics of destruction if you dare oppose their abortion agenda, among other things. Conservatives need to follow suit in defense of our principles\u2014that we will not only defend ourselves but ruin our attackers with ruthless efficiency with sheer brutality. Not just delivering a haymaker in response, but more like two shots to the head, bludgeoned, set on fire, and then run over with a tank\u2014metaphorically speaking. We have to hate these people more than they hate us. It\u2019s the only way to win. It\u2019s the only way to defend our agenda. Show no mercy for you shall receive none. This was done to get the impeachment of Kavanaugh train started\u2014and it has for the current 2020 Democratic crop. Only after the nuke has gone off have some publications noted the journalistic malpractice here, but like nuclear winter itself. There\u2019s\u2019 no one left around to see it (via AP):\n\nHeadlined \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not,\u201d the story was primarily about Deborah Ramirez, a Connecticut woman who alleged that Kavanaugh, as a freshman at Yale in 1983, had pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her. Kavanaugh has denied those claims. Yet the authors said they\u2019d uncovered a similar story involving Kavanaugh at another freshman-year party, where he allegedly exposed himself and friends pushed his penis into the hands of a female student. The story said former classmate Max Stier reported the incident to the FBI and senators as Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was being discussed, but the story said Stier would not discuss it with the authors. Kavanaugh would not comment on the story, a court spokeswoman said Monday. After the story was posted online but before it was in the print edition, the Times revised the story to add that the book reported that the woman supposedly involved in the incident declined to be interviewed, and that her friends say she doesn\u2019t recall the incident. While an editor\u2019s note pointed out the revision, it did not say why those facts had been left out in the first place. A Times spokeswoman said no one was available for an interview on Monday. The Times\u2019 deputy editorial page editor, James Dao, posted answers to readers\u2019 question on the newspaper\u2019s website Monday evening but did not address this issue. [\u2026] The Washington Post, detailing its own decision on the story, called into question the Times\u2019 decision to run with the accusation in the first place. The Post said that last year it had independently confirmed that lawmakers and authorities knew of the second accusation against Kavanaugh, but did not write about it because the woman involved would not comment and the alleged witnesses were not identified. [\u2026] The Times also apologized for an offensive tweet sent out by the opinion section advertising its initial story. The tweet said: \u201cHaving a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn\u2019t belong at Yale University in the first place.\u201d The Times deleted the tweet and said it was \u201cclearly inappropriate and offensive\u201d and was looking into how it was sent.\n\nNEW -- NYT's @rpogrebin suggests unnamed woman in her Kavanaugh excerpt may have been too drunk to remember Kavanaugh's penis being pushed into her hand.https://t.co/e5bW0Z2ZSJ \u2014 Vince Coglianese (@VinceCoglianese) September 17, 2019\n\nShe declined to be interviewed, her friends say this never happened, but here are NY Times reporters speculating on her state of mind anyway on national TV to save their own face. They should both be fired & journalists who care about credibility should want them fired \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) September 17, 2019\n\nFine, you won\u2019t let me interview you? I\u2019ll just go on National TV and tell everyone you were drunk. You don\u2019t like that? Dispute it to me on record in an interview. \u2014 Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) September 17, 2019\n\nPlot thickens.\n\nRobin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly claim that the qualifier about the other alleged Kavanaugh accuser not remembering an incident at Yale was included in the initial NYT draft but removed. pic.twitter.com/p9wUTnFyM1 \u2014 Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) September 17, 2019\n\nYeah, that was another thing that was mocked; that the Times thought that having someone shove their penis in your face was \u201charmless fun.\u201d It was a banner weekend for the paper that all the news that\u2019s fit to print. Frankly, you\u2019d get more utility wiping your rear end with it after this fiasco. Now, the authors of the Times piece are blaming their bosses for omitting the part where the alleged new accuser, Harmon Joyce, said she doesn\u2019t remember. Oh, and she might have been too drunk or something. The point is even though she didn\u2019t remember the alleged assault doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s an entirely different debate. What is clear is that that is not enough to put to print\u2014anywhere. This was done to deliver a missile strike at Kavanaugh, the GOP, and the Trump White House. This was done to push the Democratic agenda. This is their media complex at work. It\u2019s vast. It\u2019s effective. It\u2019s unrelenting. Trump won the 2016 election. He can pick his judges. Democrats don\u2019t have that power\u2014and they can\u2019t stand it. This party and their allies in the media did well confirming that they\u2019re enemies of the people, of this country, and they have to be stopped in 2020.", "description": ".09/17/2019 19:23:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/283/4b28ff5f-8664-4e42-bae7-acd9d0849d0e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
