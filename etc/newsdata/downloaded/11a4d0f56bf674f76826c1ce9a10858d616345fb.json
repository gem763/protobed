Aikman quote-tweeted analysis from The Athletic which noted that Mahomes has thrown 36 percent of Aikman\u2019s career touchdowns in just 8 percent of the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback\u2019s career games.\n\nNFL HALL OF FAMER TROY AIKMAN APPEARS UNHAPPY WITH PATRICK MAHOMES COMPARISON\n\nAikman replied: \u201ciCYMI: Talk to me when he has 33% of my Super Bowl Titles.\u201d\n\nBut he insisted the tweet wasn\u2019t a jab at Mahomes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare anything that\u2019s happening in today\u2019s game to any other era,\u201d the three-time Super Bowl winner said. \u201c[Patrick Mahomes]\u2019s been phenomenal. Great kid, love everything about him. I just don\u2019t like when we start trying to look at numbers and saying \u2018this is why this guy\u2019s greater than this particular player, this former player,\u2019 whatever it is. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nRICHIE INCOGNITO DENIES ROLE IN BULLYING SCANDAL, BLAMES 'DEMONS' FOR EX-TEAMMATE BEING OUT OF NFL\n\nWhile the NFL has shifted dramatically to a pass-first league and Mahomes has fully taken advantage of that, the Chiefs quarterback doesn\u2019t have the same exact talent around him that Aikman had.\n\nAikman played with Hall of Famers Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith \u2013 along with an elite offensive line \u2013 when he won back-to-back Super Bowls in 1992 and 1993. Having Hall of Famer Charles Haley in the middle of his career and borderline Hall of Famer Darren Woodson on defense also helped.\n\nAt this point, it doesn\u2019t appear Mahomes has the future Hall of Fame talent that Aikman did. Though, Mahomes does have one of the league's top tight ends in Travis Kelce.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Chiefs also had one of the worst defenses in the NFL last season compared to Aikman playing with one of the best defenses in the league consistently during his three Super Bowl runs.", "description": "Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman said Wednesday \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to compare Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes to him because of the different eras.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
