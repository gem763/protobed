There is also an additional early-state path: 5 percent in two approved polls conducted Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina. Candidates can meet either of the two polling thresholds in order to satisfy that requirement.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/7f/40/f2b649eb45bc9c3ae674d3479cd2/fall-debates.png\" true\n\nPolls must be released between Sept. 13 and seven days before the November debate \u2014 the timing or location of which has not yet been announced \u2014 to count toward qualification.\n\nAdditionally, candidates now need to receive donations from 165,000 unique donors \u2014 up from 130,000 from the September and October debates \u2014 with 600 unique donors in 20 different states, territories or the District of Columbia.", "description": "Like the September and October debates, candidates will need to clear both polling and donor thresholds.", "authors": ["Zach Montellaro"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/58/c4/5d59f1854f58aafbe524f0b1ef71/190923-tom-perez-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
