It is the first time the latter has been included and his elevation comes after only four Premier League starts. Abraham, who has eight goals this season, won caps against Germany and Brazil in 2017.\n\nGareth Southgate worried about disorder in Prague and racism in Sofia Read more\n\nBut the omissions were equally significant and they were headlined by Kyle Walker, Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard \u2013 each of whom started in the World Cup semi-final defeat against Croatia in 2018. Eric Dier, a substitute in that game, has also missed out and so has Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\nSouthgate made the point that telling players they are not needed for a particular get together is the worst part of his job but said no conversation would be as difficult as the one he had with Wayne Rooney, whose England career he effectively ended. That episode has steeled him.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re selecting a squad, the players need to see some sort of meritocracy when possible,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWho am I going to leave out if I bring guys back in? Does it mean leaving out somebody who is scoring freely and playing exceptionally well just because they\u2019re younger? I think that everyone within the squad would look and say: \u2018OK, there\u2019s a privileged access to certain players.\u2019 To put them [Alli or Oxlade-Chamberlain] in means I\u2019ve got to leave somebody out who is in form. So a Mason Mount or a James Maddison. Nothing has been as difficult as leaving Wayne [Rooney] out \u2013 because of what he\u2019s done in the game and his seniority.\u201d\n\nIt is questionable whether such a meritocracy existed during Southgate\u2019s days as an England player but was there such intense competition for places? The new wave of young players, who also include Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Joe Gomez, Declan Rice, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Callum Hudson-Odoi, have increased the pressure. Hudson-Odoi will be a part of the under-21s squad during the upcoming break, having only just returned from long-term injury.\n\nSouthgate has included only 11 of his squad from the World Cup finals, but expects to see players battle back. \u201cAll of the conversations we\u2019ve had with the players [who have been left out], I\u2019ve got to say they\u2019re very realistic about the amount of football they\u2019ve played and exactly where they\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very mature in how they\u2019ve responded to that. I don\u2019t expect anything other than a really good reaction.\u201d\n\nWalker was the surprise exclusion from the last squad, which won home games against Bulgaria and Kosovo, and it sounds as though he is firmly below Alexander-Arnold and Kieran Trippier in Southgate\u2019s thinking. Right-back is an area of particular strength, where Aaron Wan-Bissaka has missed out because of tonsillitis.\n\n\u201cKyle is the slightly more defensive full-back,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe has good qualities with the ball but the other two boys [Alexander-Arnold and Trippier] we felt did well last month. We didn\u2019t feel the decision to change would be the right one.\u201d\n\nHudson-Odoi\u2019s instant impact leaves Pulisic out in the cold at Chelsea | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nA lack of football at club level has held back Alli, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Dier, with the latter having started only one game for Tottenham all season \u2013 the Carabao Cup exit against Colchester. Alli has been fit since the last international break, if not at full sharpness after hamstring trouble, but he has started only three times for Spurs while Oxlade-Chamberlain has started twice for Liverpool since he was included by Southgate in the previous squad.\n\nSouthgate did not pull his punches in his assessment of Alli, who has struggled for form since the beginning of last season. \u201cThe last 12 months in particular has been frustrating for him,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe\u2019s had hamstring injuries and he played a lot deeper last year. There were signs the other night [against Bayern Munich] of him getting into the areas where he is really dangerous and the high pressing. There are a few things for him to contend with. He\u2019s got a fight on his hands at his club but I know his mentality will be to get back in.\u201d\n\nLingard has not scored for Manchester United since January and Southgate mentioned how attacking midfielders \u201care going to be judged on goals and assists\u201d. He added: \u201cWhen you look at the likes of [Raheem] Sterling and Sancho, it\u2019s a really high bar. Jesse\u2019s had a difficult period and he\u2019s aware of that but he\u2019s another player that can fight back.\u201d\n\nSouthgate said he had recalled Fabian Delph for his leadership and the defensive balance he brings to the midfield options.", "description": "England manager Gareth Southgate has left familiar names out of his squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers to show young players that no one has privileged access", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cb415d490670d572226a7cda8c4d8ccf2b0140/0_79_1937_1162/master/1937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20e843be7d2c3d89b6ec90c090f07b7e", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
