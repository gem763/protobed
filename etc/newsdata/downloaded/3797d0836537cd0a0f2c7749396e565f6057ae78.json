But he said he would be willing to accept one if it would secure the goal of getting Britain out of the EU.\n\nWhere it gets interesting is his thoughts on what happens next.\n\n\u201cIf we decided, in some considerable years\u2019 time that we wanted to review our membership of any such customs union if we signed it \u2013 and I'm not saying we will \u2013 that's a matter for negotiation and discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nWith that he was singing from the same hymn sheet as Michael Gove, who has also suggested that whatever is agreed could be changed after the UK is out of the bloc.\n\nPeople like Cox and Gove are a lot smarter than the zealots of the European Research Group, for whom nothing short of pushing Ireland out of the way and sailing off into the middle of the Atlantic will do.\n\nThey are arguably the more cynical members of a cynical tribe too.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s days in Number 10 Downing Street are numbered and her probably ERG backed successor could make her look like an accommodating moderate.\n\nThey\u2019ll be in charge of the next phase, if we get to it.\n\nIt would be difficult to overturn a compromise agreed with Corbyn and codified in law. But Cox and Gove have prepared the ground for it, if not by the current parliament then certainly for a future one, and one can easily imagine a hard Brexiteer doing all in their power to harden Brexit using this potential loophole.\n\nOnly a confirmatory referendum (with an option to remain, otherwise it would be a nonsense) can change that dynamic. Gove, Cox and the smarter Brexiteers, would find it much harder to overturn a deal that had received the backing of \u201cthe British people\u201d, particularly given what they\u2019ve said about referenda, and the importance of respecting them. I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to try, but they\u2019d find it harder.\n\nWe may ultimately end up with one anyway because it\u2019s really the only way out.\n\nMay and Corbyn\u2019s conceptions of Brexit are miles apart. Their respective proposals have only two things in common: they are both worse than the deal we have and neither will satisfy hardcore Brexiteers. The best option is a Final Say referendum and, in my opinion, a vote to remain inside the EU.\n\nIf Corbyn won\u2019t listen to the majority of Labour members, the majority of Labour voters, Unison, the GMB, his deputy Tom Watson, shadow cabinet members like Emily Thornberry, perhaps he should sit down and re-read his own holy book.", "description": "Never trust a Tory.\u00a0 That\u2019s an article of faith in large parts of the Labour movement.\u00a0 You can recognise those who hold to it because they never use the word \u201cConservative\u201d to describe their opponents, whom they characterise as demons spawned from the blackest pits of hell.
