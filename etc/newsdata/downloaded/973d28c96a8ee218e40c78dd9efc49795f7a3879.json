The New York Giants beat the Red Sox twice in the 1912 World Series, the year Fenway opened. They also defeated the Boston Braves in Fenway during the 1914 and \u201815 seasons.\n\n\u201cI was just excited being able to do that before friends and family,\u201d Mike Yastrzemski said. \u201cThe crowd reactions, all night, were incredible. I can\u2019t thank them enough for being supportive.\u201d\n\nThe game featured a major-league record-tying 24 pitchers - including a team-record 13 by the Giants - and had 50 players overall, lasting 5 hours, 54 minutes. \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\u201d was played in the middle of the 14th inning.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get my 10,000 steps in,\u201d Bochy joked of the changes. \u201cI was a little behind.\u201d\n\nThe Giants\u2018 pitchers threw 294 pitches to Boston\u2019s 253.\n\nBochy, who is retiring at the end of the season, moved one win away from becoming the 11th big-league manager to reach 2,000 victories.\n\nDonovan Solano opened the 15th with a ground-rule double against Trevor Kelley (0-2) and advanced on a wild pitch before the Dickerson\u2019s sac fly.\n\nDickerson (oblique) was not in the starting lineup. Bochy said before the game that he\u2019d likely be in Wednesday, and, he was, pinch hitting at 12:50 a.m.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can play him in a doubleheader,\u201d Bochy said, smiling.\n\nDereck Rodriguez (6-9) worked two innings for the victory.\n\nBrandon Crawford\u2019s RBI double had given the Giants the lead in the 13th before Boston\u2019s pinch hitter Juan Centeno drew a bases-loaded walk off Kyle Barraclough, the Giants\u2018 fourth pitcher of the inning.\n\nYastrzemski hit a 95.8 mph fastball from Nathan Eovaldi into the center-field bleachers for his 20th of the season, getting a nice ovation - many standing - as he circled the bases when his shot made it 5-1 in the fourth. He finished 2 for 7 with a double, walk and three strikeouts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special moment,\u201d Bochy said of the homer. \u201cA lot of attention with him coming here. . Number 20, that\u2019s quite the night for the kid.\u201d\n\nHis teammates were excited in the dugout.\n\n\u201cI was so happy for him,\u201d Giants starting pitcher Logan Webb said.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. hit a solo homer and drove in two runs for the Red Sox.\n\nEven Eovaldi could appreciate the moment for the younger Yaz.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s cool,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I mean you see our fans, too, they give him a really good welcome. Cool experience.\u201d\n\nThe Yastrzemskis walked Fenway\u2019s outfield grass before the game and Mike played left field, where his grandfather shined and captured seven Gold Gloves during his 23-year career, all with the Red Sox.\n\nCarl, who turned 80 in August, retired in 1983 after collecting 3,419 hits, including 452 homers and over 1,800 RBIs. In 1967, he won the AL MVP when he captured the Triple Crown. He was inducted into the Hall in 1989 and the Red Sox dedicated a statue of him outside the right-field entrance in 2013.\n\nSTAR STRUCK\n\nBochy said it was an honor to meet Carl Yastrzemski before the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with a Hall of Famer that I grew up trying to impersonate as a hitter as a kid, and there he was in my office,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a cool moment. I\u2019m like anybody that grew up idolizing these guys when you have a chance to meet him.\u201d\n\nGLOVE WORK\n\nBoston\u2019s Marco Hern\u00e1ndez saved a run with diving stop on Donovan Solano\u2019s grounder in the 10th and CF Brady made a leaping grab on Belt\u2019s drive in the 12th.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nGiants: Bochy said C Buster Posey \u201ccould use a day\u201d because of tightness in back and hip area.\n\nRed Sox: Manager Alex Cora said LHP David Price (cyst left wrist) could undergo surgery for it during the offseason. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to talk about,\u201d Cora said. Price hasn\u2019t pitched since Sept. 1. \u2026 OF Mookie Betts missed his third straight game with inflammation in his left foot. \u2026 J.D. Martinez was removed was left groin tightness and Sam Travis left after getting hit in the head - after his helmet popped off - by a throw on a headfirst slide into third on his triple.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Jeff Samardzija (10-12, 3.72 ERA) is set to start Wednesday for the Giants. RHP Jhoulys Chac\u00edn (3-10, 5.44) is slated to go for the Red Sox.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Yastrzemski rounded the bases to the cheers of the Fenway Park fans after hitting a solo homer for San Francisco - like his grandfather heard numerous times during his illustrious career with the Red Sox.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Powtak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/giants_red_sox_baseball_03669_c0-128-2759-1736_s1770x1032.jpg?19b9c403d3d4248a276fd1c2b4865d5641cf8609", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
