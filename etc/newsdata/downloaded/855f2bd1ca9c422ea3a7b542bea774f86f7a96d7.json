Lebanon for third day", "language": "en", "text": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of Lebanese people took to the streets Saturday for a third day of protests against tax increases and alleged official corruption despite several arrests by security forces.\n\nThey streamed into the streets around the country\u2019s parliament in Beirut, as well as elsewhere across the country, AFP journalists said, despite calls for calm from politicians and dozens of arrests on Friday.\n\nThe number of protesters grew steadily throughout the day, with major demonstrations in second city Tripoli, in the north, and other locations.\n\nMany waved billowing Lebanese flags and insisted the protests should remain peaceful and non-sectarian.\n\nThe demonstrators are demanding a sweeping overhaul of Lebanon\u2019s political system, citing grievances ranging from austerity measures to poor infrastructure.\n\nThey have crippled main roads and threatened to topple the country\u2019s fragile coalition government.\n\nMost Lebanese politicians have uncharacteristically admitted the demonstrations are spontaneous, rather than blaming outside influence.\n\nIn Tripoli demonstrator Hoda Sayyur was unimpressed by the contrition some leaders displayed on television and echoed a widely-held hope that the entire political class be replaced.\n\n\u201cThey took all our fundamental rights\u2026 We are dying at hospital gates,\u201d the woman in her fifties said.\n\n\u201cI will stay in the street\u2026 Since I was born, we\u2019ve been spectators to their quarrels and corruption,\u201d she said.\n\nThe army on Saturday called on protesters to \u201cexpress themselves peacefully without harming public and private property\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Ultimatum \u2013\n\nSaturday evening thousands were again packed into the Riyadh al-Solh Square in central Beirut, despite security forces using tear gas and water cannons to disperse similar crowds a day before.\n\nThe Internal Security Forces said 70 arrests were made Friday on accusations of theft and arson.\n\nBut all of those held at the main police barracks were released Saturday, the National News Agency (NNA) said.\n\nIt said that the father of one man detained tried to set himself on fire in front of a police station.\n\nThe demonstrations first erupted on Thursday, sparked by a proposed 20 cent tax on calls via messaging apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nSuch calls are the main method of communication for many Lebanese and, despite the government\u2019s swift abandonment of the tax, the demonstrations quickly swelled into the largest in years.\n\nPrime Minister Saad Hariri has given his deeply divided coalition until Monday evening to give their backing to a reform package aimed at shoring up the government\u2019s finances and securing the disbursement of desperately needed economic assistance from donors.\n\nHe held a series of meetings Saturday regarding the situation, NNA said.\n\nHariri\u2019s political rival, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, gave his first response on Saturday, telling protesters their \u201cmessage was heard loudly\u201d and calling for political action.\n\nIn a thinly veiled criticism of Hariri, Nasrallah condemned those who had renounced their \u201cresponsibilities and were blaming others.\u201d\n\nBut he warned against demanding resignation of the government, saying it could take a long time to form a new one and solve the crisis.\n\nThe current unity government has the backing of most Lebanese political parties, including Hezbollah.\n\nKarim el-Mufti, a Lebanese political scientist, said Hezbollah, which is fighting in neighbouring Syria alongside the government of Bashar al-Assad, wanted to avoid potential chaos at home.\n\n\u2018Protesters beaten\u2019\n\nIn the southern port city of Tyre, supporters of Shia politician and speaker of parliament Nabih Berri attacked protesters Saturday, a witness said, a day after demonstrators had accused him of corruption.\n\nHis Amal political party condemned the attack and called for an investigation.\n\nMore than a quarter of the Lebanese population lives below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s senior politicians came to prominence during the country\u2019s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990.\n\nA protester in the southern city of Nabatiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, said protesters are demanding their \u201crights\u201d. protesting.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to portray us as a mob, but we are demanding our rights,\u201d he told a local television channel. \u201cWe are used to repression.\u201d\n\nLebanon has one of the highest public debt burdens in the world and the government is trying to reach agreement on a package of belt-tightening measures to cap the deficit in next year\u2019s budget.\n\nThe promised austerity moves are essential if Lebanon is to unlock $11 billion in economic assistance pledged by international donors last year.\n\nGrowth has plummeted in recent years, with political deadlock compounded by the impact of eight years of war in neighbouring Syria.\n\nLebanon\u2019s public debt stands at around $86 billion \u2014 more than 150 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 according to the finance ministry.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013
