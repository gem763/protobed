Here\u2019s why that would be \u2018very unusual\u2019 right now", "language": "en", "text": "Bears contend the stock market\u2019s largely sideways action over the last year signals a top may already be near, if not already established. But that would be out of keeping with recent history, says one economist.\n\nMajor indexes sit a percentage point or two away from all-time highs as stocks flip between small gains and losses on Monday, but over the past 12 months the market has advanced only modestly\u2014feeding the notion among some investors that equities may be in the process of putting in a top for the cycle, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, in a note.\n\nBut there\u2019s a rub, he said.\n\n\u201cSome investors have speculated that the market might be topping out ahead of a possible U.S. slowdown over the next year,\u201d LaVorgna wrote. \u201cHowever, this would be very unusual, as equities have always had a double-digit rally before the economy experiences a downturn.\u201d (See table below.)\n\nNatixis\n\nAs the table shows, the stock market\u2019s peak has come ahead of the economy in the run-up to seven of the last eight recessions dating back to 1960, LaVorgna noted, with an average lead of seven months. More recently, there have been much shorter lead times from the stock-market peak to the peak in the economy, he said, which \u201cmeans that strong stock-market performance could persist until very late in the business cycle.\u201d\n\nRead: A \u2018Fed put\u2019 on the stock market could expire worthless due to these \u2018recession errors\u2019: Stifel\u2019s Bannister\n\nThe market\u2019s largely sideways trade over the last 12 months\u2014the S&P 500 SPX, +0.20% has gained 2.2% over the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% is up 0.8% over the same stretch\u2014\u201csuggests that we have not seen the highs of the current business cycle,\u201d LaVorgna said.\n\nThat is in keeping with Natixis\u2019s view that an economic downturn before 2021 is unlikely. But LaVorgna notes that the average percent change in stocks, excluding dividends, in the 12 months ahead of the peak has been 17.6%.\n\n\u201cWe need to be clear: we are not forecasting recession,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, it is important to highlight that stocks tend to do very well even as we get closer to an economic inflection point,\u201d which means investors should \u201cremain vigilant on the financial outlook.\u201d", "description": "Bears contend the stock market\u2019s largely sideways action over the last year signals a top may already be in.
