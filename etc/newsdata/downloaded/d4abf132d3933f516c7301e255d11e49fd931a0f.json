The rotation that began last week earnestly picked up yesterday with investors fleeing high-beta names looking for a combination of low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and yield.\n\nThat combination often occurs as a result of stocks underperforming, sending share prices lower and yields higher. This makes Energy (XLE) very attractive. The sector climbed 2.00%, aided with another move higher in West Texas Intermediate (WTI).\n\nFinancials also looked enticing for those looking for \u201ccheap\u201d stocks (based on P/E) ratio and yield.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the notion that safe havens have gotten too expensive. Despite their fat yields, Real Estate and Utilities continue to lurch lower.\n\nSector PE Ratio Yield % Change XLC 18.78 0.79% +0.32 XLY 21.03 1.27% +0.38 XLP 20.47 2.63% -0.21 XLE 17.00 3.74% +2.00 XLF 12.26 2.00% +1.53 XLV 15.43 1.64% -0.92 XLI 17.25 2.03% +0.30 XLB 18.31 2.10% -0.52 XLRE 43.25 3.12% -0.75 XLK 20.55 1.37% -0.75 XLU 20.20 2.94% -0.49\n\nAttack of the AGs\n\nCommunication Services sector eked out a gain yesterday, but it was led by Trip Advisor (TRIP) and News Corp (NWS). Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG) performed admirably, considering both companies are circling the wagons these days.\n\nYesterday, Attorney Generals (AGs) from 48 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. gathered in the nation\u2019s capital to announce an investigation into possible antitrust violations at Google, the search giant. It sounds like a fishing expedition more than anything akin to investigating illegal activity.\n\nOne of the AGs said there wasn\u2019t a sense of what the conclusion would be because \u201cyou gotta find liability before you get to remedies.\u201d Essentially, size is the problem, and increased advertising costs lead to increased consumer costs.\n\nIt appears they are not only pushing on the string, but they are also connecting too many dots. Anyway, this free-for-all is just getting started and could go well beyond the advertising part of the business.\n\nMomentum darlings are off a lot in the past couple of months, and soon they could be the hot value investments.\n\nApproach\n\nCommunication Services Consumer Discretionary Consumer Staples 1 2 1 Energy Financials Healthcare 1 1 2 Industrial Materials Real Estate 3 2 1 Technology Utilities Cash 3 0 3\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nLooks like it will be a flat to slightly lower start to trading this morning. The most intriguing, even infuriating, news of the morning is how the media\u2019s over hyping of recession is influencing polls. There is so much amazing news people are not hearing. You have to ask how the media can be so biased as to increase the risk of recession by fanning the flames and ignoring or severely under reporting real time stuff- great stuff.\n\nThe Chief Economists at NFIB shares those sentiments:\n\nAugust 2019 Report:\n\nSmall Business Economy Remains Steady,\n\nDespite Doom and Gloom Narrative That\u2019s Hampering Expectations\n\nhttps://www.nfib.com/surveys/small-business-economic-trends/\n\nThe NFIB Small Business Optimism Index fell 1.6 points to 103.1, remaining within the top 15 percent of readings.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the success we continue to see on Main Street, the manic predictions of recession are having a psychological effect and creating uncertainty for small business owners throughout the country,\u201d said NFIB President and CEO Juanita D. Duggan. \u201cSmall business owners continue to invest, grow, and hire at historically high levels, and we see no indication of a coming recession.\u201d\n\nSmall Business Owners\u2019 Difficulty Finding Qualified Workers Reaches Survey High in August\n\nTwenty-seven percent ranked finding qualified workers as their No. 1 business problem.\n\nOverall, 64 percent of owners surveyed said they hired or tried to hire people in August, a slight increase from the month before. Of those, 89 percent reported finding few, if any, qualified applicants.\n\nThirty-five percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the period, down four points from July. Forty-nine percent had openings in construction, while 42 percent had unfilled positions in manufacturing. Thirty-five percent or more in all industry groups expect financial services and professional services reported unfilled openings.\n\nThirty-three percent have job openings for skilled workers, and 13 percent have openings for unskilled workers.\n\nOwners citing \u201cfew or no qualified applicants\u201d\n\nConstruction (highest share) 68%\n\nManufacturing 59%\n\nA net 29 percent reported raising compensation and a net 19 percent plan to raise compensation in the coming months. Fourteen percent of all firms reported using temporary workers. ??", "description": "Call it cautious optimism or just investors shaken up from .09/10/2019 19:27:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/76105473-2de5-44a2-b1d1-c1b10b6c6076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
