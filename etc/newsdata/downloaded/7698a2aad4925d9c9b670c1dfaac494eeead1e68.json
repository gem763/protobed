This will continue to be the case when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMr Gove told parliament on Thursday that delays at the main port of Dover were a material risk but all would run smoothly if companies have the necessary customs declarations. While scarcity of some product lines may push up prices, it was unlikely to lead to full-scale shortages, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no good time of year to leave the European Union without a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever we have to be ready for the consequences.\u201d\n\nOnce considered the industry\u2019s nightmare scenario at the extreme edge of probability, a no-deal Brexit is now looking ever more possible after Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to take Britain out of the EU without an agreement if necessary.\n\nWhile opposition parties are trying to force another delay, a looming election means nothing can be taken for granted.\n\nThat marks a major challenge for a food industry which relies heavily on imports from Europe during the autumn when warmer climes are needed to grow some fruit and vegetables.\n\nWhile Britain normally buys in around half of its food, with about a third coming from the EU, by the end of October the bloc provides some 86% of lettuces, 70% of tomatoes and 27% of soft fruit, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC).\n\nFood grown in North Africa also comes through Spain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is any risk that the UK will go hungry, the question is will the UK be able to eat what it wants to eat in terms of fresh food?,\u201d said the senior supermarket executive.\n\nAutumn is also when retailers fill their warehouses ahead of the year\u2019s busiest shopping season \u2014 Christmas.\n\nTesco boss Dave Lewis has said Britain\u2019s biggest retailer stockpiled over 200 million pounds worth of long-life goods by the original Brexit deadline of end March, but will struggle to repeat that due to the millions of mince pies, hams and cheeses that already sit in warehouses.\n\nFresh food can\u2019t be stockpiled and border delays of a few days would wilt such produce meaning it could be put on final discount almost as soon as it arrives in store.\n\nTesco, with a No. 1 grocery market share of 27%, a workforce of 320,000 and a sourcing base of over 50 countries, expects to hold its own alongside rivals.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s sources a higher proportion of cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers in Britain than others, Morrisons makes half of all its own brand and fresh food and Asda benefits from being part of Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer.\n\nThe major supermarkets have declined to say how much they are spending on their Brexit preparations, and declined to give any more details about their current readiness for a no-deal departure.\n\nAhead of the deadline, manufacturers, suppliers and retailers are battling to unravel a system honed over decades that delivers fresh and non-perishable goods to the stores just in time for sale, and in the most economically efficient way.\n\nThe need to build up stocks - to mitigate for any delays at ports - is putting pressure on the vast warehouses that form the backbone of Britain\u2019s food network. Jonathan Baker, executive director at Lineage UK, the world\u2019s largest temperature-controlled logistics firm, said his sites are at maximum capacity.\n\nWorking in the industry for 37 years, he said the whole system started to creak before the original March deadline, with some food deliveries failing as logistics providers struggled to extract goods on time from warehouses filled to the brim.\n\n\u201cIt could be a lot worse in October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last Brexit deadline, we were coming out of a relatively quiet period whereas this is slap bang in the busiest time of year.\u201d\n\nWith so much uncertainty in the air, supermarkets are asking suppliers to hold more stock, and are likely to source more longer-life vegetables such as carrots and potatoes to avoid any empty shelves, according to the BRC.\n\n\u201cIf your competitor is doing better than you then the consumer will walk,\u201d said Andrew Opie, a director at the BRC lobby group. \u201cOne of the key items that all consumers look for is tomatoes. If you can\u2019t see it you think the whole store is somehow depleted.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "UK supermarkets are frustrated with the government\u2019s demands to stockpile food in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal, with executives saying they should not be blamed if a no-deal Brexit leads to shortages.", "authors": ["James Davey", "Kate Holton"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/10/tomatoes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
