We all want another vote.\u201d\n\nHe added: \"Everyone knows perfectly well that we\u2019re made up of people who want to Remain.\"\n\nBut Remainer and former Tony Blair spin doctor Alastair Campbell said: \"Those letters sent to staff last night saying the campaign director and comms Director have been fired must be forgeries then.\n\n\"Likewise the instruction to security not to let them in building today must have been imagined.\n\n\"He rightly said we are in touching distance of getting a confirmatory referendum. Hence the madness of a deliberate act of sabotage and destabilisation at this time of all times.\n\n\"After his rare visit to the building today it is to be hoped those actually working for a second referendum rather than talking about it to their business pals (none of whom have made donations for months) can get on with their jobs and put this silly episode behind us.\"\n\nMr Baldwin told the BBC: \"It\u2019s a curious situation. We are here three days before the Brexit deadline with the prospect of crashing into a general election or crashing out of Europe or both.\n\n\u201cThe Liberal Democrats appear to be playing some rather strange games with the People's Vote campaign at the moment and playing games over a general election.\n\n\u201cRoland Rudd has chosen this time to put a wrecking ball really through the campaign.\n\n\"It\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s certainly not about him. The People\u2019s Vote campaign is five different organisations - he\u2019s the non executive chairman of one, the outgoing non executive chairman of one.\n\n\"He\u2019s making a mistake that I think a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics. which is to think that because they have a certain title on a board that they then own the campaign.\"\n\nHe added: \"The People\u2019s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just one businessman who\u2019s hardly ever seen in the campaign, I think he\u2019s been in offices like three or four times in the past 18 months.\n\n\"It\u2019s really not for him to tell the campaign what to do I\u2019m afraid.\"", "description": "Tom Baldwin hit out at director Roland Rudd and vowed to come into work anyway - risking a clash with security", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Ben Cawthra Lnp", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740439.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Politicians-in-Westminster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
