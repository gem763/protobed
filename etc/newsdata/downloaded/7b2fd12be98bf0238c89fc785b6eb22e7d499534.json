As Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal has unfurled over the last few days, Pelosi has taken steps to put her a just little closer to the path of impeachment, issuing a rare Dear Colleague letter on Sunday. In the brief sent to all members of Congress, the Speaker states that if the Trump administration continues to block acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from giving Congress the \u201cfull complaint\u201d filed earlier this year by a whistleblower in the intelligence community, then the administration will \u201cbe entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will takes us into a whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nTo recap the complicated and developing scandal, Pelosi is referring to a complaint filed by an intelligence officer in August involving a call Trump made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, reportedly encouraging him to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s son in the country \u2014 an exchange that Trump admitted to on Sunday. In her letter, Pelosi also demanded that Maguire \u201cestablish a path for the whistleblower to speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law.\u201d On Thursday, Intelligence Community inspector general Michael Atkinson declined to give Congress the whistleblower\u2019s complaint that broke open the scandal, an act that Adam Schiff called \u201cunprecedented.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Democrats also mulled over employing the congressional power to hold witnesses in contempt, an act that hasn\u2019t been used in almost 100 years. House Judiciary member Ted Lieu weighed in favor of contempt, tweeting that if Maguire does not comply, the House must also \u201chave procedures in place to use the inherent contempt powers of Congress,\u201d adding, \u201cWe cannot have a repeat of the Lewandowski hearing.\u201d Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee was more enthusiastic: \u201cI say do it,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cLet them argue in court that they take the position that it\u2019s legally questionable. We back off of everything! We\u2019ve been very weak.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the party, representatives grew more frustrated at Speaker Pelosi\u2019s unwillingness to impeach the president for his repeat constitutional offenses. \u201cAt this point, the bigger national scandal isn\u2019t the president\u2019s lawbreaking behavior \u2014 it is the Democratic Party\u2019s refusal to impeach him for it,\u201d tweeted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. House Democrats in favor of impeachment currently number at 138 \u2014 a majority of the caucus.", "description": "The Speaker issued a rare Dear Colleague letter stating that if the Trump administration and Acting DNI Director Maguire do not allow Congress to see the Ukraine scandal whistleblower\u2019s transcript, there will be a \u201cwhole new stage of investigation.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/22/Pelosi_impeachment.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
