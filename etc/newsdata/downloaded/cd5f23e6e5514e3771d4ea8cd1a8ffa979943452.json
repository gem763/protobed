There are a few reasons.\n\nTo get your attention. Particularly for kids who don\u2019t have language yet, whacking their heads against something is a great way to get mom or dad to come scurrying over. In typical motor development, kids may occasionally bang their heads randomly, Dr. Kurtz said. But if they realize head banging gets you to pay attention, they may make it into a game. What started out as a r andom accident \u201ccan develop into a learned behavior,\u201d Dr. Kurtz said. (I never had a headbanger, but I recognized the parent-toddler feedback loop Dr. Kurtz described: One of my kids figured out that licking foreign surfaces reliably got our attention, so she licked everything, including a window at Southwest Florida International Airport, looking positively delighted with herself. We\u2019re just lucky she didn\u2019t get botulism.)\n\nTo discourage the behavior, move the child away from whatever surface she\u2019s banging her head against; say, \u201cno head banging;\u201d and distract her with a song or a game, said Hugh Bases, M.D., a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at N.Y.U. School of Medicine.\n\nTo self-soothe. Some children will bang their heads around naptime or bedtime, Dr. Heard-Garris said, as a way to calm their bodies down. \u201cThat repetition, that movement, that calms down their brain and tells them its time to go to sleep,\u201d she said. Hearing the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of your kid\u2019s head hitting the mattress for 10 minutes might be upsetting, Dr. Heard-Garris said. But do not install bumpers or put stuffed animals into the crib to interrupt your headbanger, she cautioned, as the safest sleep environment for babies is an empty crib with a flat mattress (more on safe sleep guidelines here).\n\nAnd don\u2019t go into the baby\u2019s room every time you hear the banging \u2014 he will have a very difficult time sleeping if you interrupt his soothing rituals. If you\u2019re concerned, you can watch him on a video monitor, Dr. Heard-Garris said.\n\nTo express frustration. Before children can convey their feelings in words, they may bang their heads if they are frustrated with a task. In that case, Dr. Bases said, observe the child\u2019s behavior. If you can recognize the signs of your child\u2019s frustration, you can help her before she starts head banging, Dr. Bases said.", "description": "Some babies and toddlers bump their heads on purpose.
