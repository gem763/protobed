Today, the company is introducing a completely redesigned Creative Cloud app that better integrates your Creative Cloud Libraries and offers deeper search and asset management features. With this, the app becomes less of an installer and more of a central command center for your work across Creative Cloud\u2019s applications.\n\nThe rollout for this update is a bit odd. It will start in France and Germany today, followed by Japan tomorrow. Customers in the U.S. and elsewhere will see it on their desktops over the course of the next week.\n\nLike before, the core feature of the app is to help you install the rest of the Creative Cloud tools. That\u2019s not changing. But unlike in previous versions, you can now also more easily see what\u2019s in your libraries thanks to a new full-screen management tool that shows you previews of your assets. Adobe says it also made it easier to share libraries with others.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1894823,1894827\"]\n\nThe Creative Cloud app also now features a Tutorial Hub for learning more about how to use the various CC apps. That\u2019s something Adobe has put quite a bit of emphasis on recently. The latest CC version of Lightroom, for example, now also features built-in tutorials.\n\nThe app also lets you manage the fonts you have installed on your machine. Like before, though, it looks like you\u2019ll have to use the web app to search for and select the fonts you want to install. I\u2019m surprised Adobe didn\u2019t build this relatively basic functionality right into the app.", "description": "As Adobe expanded its product lineup and cloud-based services in recent years, its core Creative Cloud app, the desktop app you use to download the rest of the Creative Cloud apps, started to feel a bit limited.
