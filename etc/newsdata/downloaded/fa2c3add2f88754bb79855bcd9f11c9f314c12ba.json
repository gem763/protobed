I don't think he's the kind of guy who should be praised at the international level,\" said Efrem Berhe, an Eritrean youth activist.\n\n\"Saying that he made peace in Eritrea is very inaccurate, because there is no peace.\"\n\nIn 2018, hundreds of people marched between Ottawa City Hall and Parliament Hill to celebrate the opening of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. (Laura Osman/CBC)\n\nBerhe's parents are still living in Eritrea, where there are stll rampant human rights violations. There is no freedom of religion, freedom of information or freedom of the press.\n\nSince the peace treaty, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki has also closed the border at the town of Zalambessa.\n\n\"Abiy is making an alliance with the Eritrean dictator, but not with Eritrean people,\" Berhe said.\n\n\"To put it bluntly \u2014 sleeping with a brutal dictator does not constitute peace building.\"\n\nYears of border issues\n\n\"Abiy accepted the peace agreement, but he is not pushing to demarcate the border,\" said Yohannes Drar, a social worker at the Royal Ottawa Health Centre.\n\nBefore Drar came to Canada, he fought for Eritrean independence as a freedom fighter. He thinks the Nobel Peace Prize is positive news for Ethiopia, but not his home country.\n\n\"After Eritrea achieved independence, it came under a dictatorship,\" said Drar. \"Now, we are like the North Korea of Africa.\"\n\nFor Drar, a clearly defined border between Ethiopia and Eritrea is the first step toward establishing Eritrea's sovereignty and a lasting peace.\n\nAbiy has not acknowledged the human rights violations going on in Eritrea, Drar said, adding he hopes the award will shed light on the ongoing situation in his country.\n\nYohannes Drar (left), a former freedom fighter in Eritrea, and Efrem Berhe (right), an Eritrean youth activist, both disagree with the decision to award Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed the Nobel Peace Prize. (Submitted by Yohannes Drar and Efrem Berhe)\n\nMore peaceful candidates\n\nAs for Berhe, he wishes the Nobel Peace Prize committee would have acknowledged reformers like the Eritrean group nicknamed \"The G-15,\" which first called for an open dialogue with Ethiopia in 2001.\n\n\"It feels one-sided,\" said Berhe. \"If you're really concerned about the border conflict, how about [recognizing] the other side?\"\n\nNevertheless, Berhe hopes the prize will put more pressure on the Ethiopian government to completely withdraw from Eritrean territory.", "description": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was announced as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize last week.
