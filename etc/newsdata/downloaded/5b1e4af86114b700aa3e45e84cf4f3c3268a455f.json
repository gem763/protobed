In just a week, the shed over 250 points to 1.22 support. The sterling remains under pressure amid political uncertainty in the UK, which is only getting stronger as the fateful date of October 31 approaches, when the United Kingdom will have to leave the EU with or without a deal. The opposition parties are seriously considering launching an extremely rare impeachment process against British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This possibility was discussed at the meeting of the opposition lawmakers last Thursday after the British Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Johnson's decision to suspend the Parliament for 5 weeks ahead of the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline had been unlawful.\n\nThe judiciary of one of the UK's highest courts of appeal, in fact, agreed with the Prime Minister's critics, who claimed from the very beginning that by this measure, Johnson tried to cut short lawmakers' time to challenge his Brexit plans before the deadline.

The House of Commons had already passed a law that legally obliges Johnson to ask for an extension until October 19, provided that until this moment, the Government fails to secure a new deal with Brussels.\n\nThe bottom line is that political events in England significantly increase the likelihood of even greater losses in the pound sterling. Market participants seriously consider the possibility of a hard exit, that is, without maintaining access to a single European market and the customs union. With this in mind, we recommend opening \"short\" positions in and pairs.
