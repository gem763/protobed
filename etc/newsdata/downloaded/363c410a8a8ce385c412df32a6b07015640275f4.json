According to the Instagram account that first shared the photo, the snap was originally posted last summer.\n\nAnd just last week, the two were once again spotted out together, this time at a hockey game. Both Jim and Wilson appeared to keep a low profile during the game, wearing baseball caps and hoodie sweatshirts for the outing.\n\nBut both Jim and the nanny have denied having an extramarital relationship. The status of Jim and Meghan\u2019s relationship remains unclear.\n\n\u201cThe allegations are completely false,\u201d Wilson wrote on Instagram when a fan asked about the rumors.\n\nOn Monday, Jim posted a lengthy message to his Instagram account, calling the allegations \u201cdisgusting and irresponsible.\u201d Jim said he looked at Wilson as one of his children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be accused of something. It\u2019s another thing to be so negligent and so careless, and ruin the lives of innocent young people.. I did not sleep with our nanny,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe\u2019s not just a nanny, she is someone that we brought into our house and promised to protect and look after while she was in our home. We have been treating and raising this young girl like she is our own child! For someone to accuse me of sleeping with her is not only wrong, it\u2019s disgusting and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cJust because I am an athlete and I was portrayed as a bad person on bravo TV. Doesn\u2019t mean I dont have a clue what life is all about. We made a promise to that young girls mom, that We would take care of her and make sure that she was safe while she was in our hands. I will not sit here and take this bullshit without fighting back.\u201d\n\nHe also appeared to take aim at Meghan, accusing her of using social media to manipulate the truth.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re extremely whitty [sic] and intelligent, and know how to play the Instagram game. Doesn\u2019t give you the right to use that platform to wrongfully accuse,\u201d he concluded. Not only is it irresponsible. It is dangerous and puts my family in harms way. We all make mistakes. This is not one of those times. My heart is broken for everyone involved. if you get anything out of this post.
