International fell 0.8% to $58.89.\n\nBloomberg reported that China wants to hold more talks this month to discuss details of the \u201cvery substantial phase one\u201d trade agreement touted by U.S. President Donald Trump. That contrasted with the U.S. president\u2019s contention that the two sides were closer to an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe were celebrating traction in the U.S.-China trade talks, but once again China did not sign the agreement and warned to keep the champagne on ice after phase one of the trade deal,\u201d wrote Dan Flynn, a commodities analyst at Chicago\u2019s Price Futures Group.\n\nThe Bloomberg report added that even if the two sides managed to agree on a deal, existing tariffs would not be rolled back and thus slowing economic growth would remain a major concern for the oil market.\n\nTraders now await the weekly crude stockpile data due tomorrow and Thursday. Inventories rose by 9.5 million barrels over the four weeks through Oct. 4, according to Energy Information Administration data.", "description": "Oil Prices Fall as Traders Reassess Sino-U.S. Trade Talk Progress", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2J0AZ-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
