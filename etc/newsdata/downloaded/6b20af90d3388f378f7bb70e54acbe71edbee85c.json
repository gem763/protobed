The United States also provided some funding.\n\nBut many white farmers dug their heels in, hiding behind the \u201cwilling buyer-willing seller\u201d principle, and the overall programme achieved less than half its targets.\n\nIt was also plagued by allegations of graft. When Blair came to power in 1997 he made it very clear that Britain, particularly under Labour, had no obligation to finance land redistribution.\n\nMugabe responded by drafting a new constitution that allowed for the compulsory purchase of land without compensation. The charter was defeated in a referendum in 2000.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
