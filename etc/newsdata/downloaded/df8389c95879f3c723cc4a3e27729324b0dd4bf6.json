The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has confirmed to the Guardian it is investigating how the money was awarded.\n\nAsked whether a further inquiry might be merited into any potential conflict of interests, Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019m here to talk about, as I said, what we\u2019re going to talk about at the UN.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he and Arcuri had ever had a sexual relationship, Johnson said: \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, I\u2019m going to talk exclusively about what we\u2019re doing here at the UN.\u201d\n\nHe declined to answer three further questions, including being invited to deny any of the allegations made in the Sunday Times article, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about what we\u2019re doing in the UN.\u201d\n\nBoth Labour and Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, have said Johnson should answer questions on what happened.\n\nArcuri\u2019s company Innotech was given \u00a310,000 in sponsorship from a mayoral organisation in 2013, the Sunday Times reported. Johnson was also the guest speaker at several of its events, and appeared in a Google hangout alongside Arcuri.\n\nThe report also suggests that Arcuri was initially refused permission to attend two of the trade mission trips because her business did not meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nBut after the intervention of Johnson, she was allowed on to the missions, according to an email seen by the paper. It points out that Johnson was bound by a Greater London Authority (GLA) code of conduct to declare any private interests. He was also banned from providing undue benefits to friends.", "description": "Prime minister refuses six times to be drawn on ties to Jennifer Arcuri, who received thousands in taxpayers\u2019 money", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbb0723e7bd50d0c859641080050d7af7f7c7800/0_203_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe753cb6a64a5db16dff43de3da299d2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
