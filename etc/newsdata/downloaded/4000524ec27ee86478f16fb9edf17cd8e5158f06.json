England booked their place in the World Cup quarter-final but it could come at a cost after an injury scare to Billy Vunipola.\n\nWith three wins from three, England have secured their passage to the knockout stages with a game to spare, although they are yet to face a true test of their title credentials.\n\nArgentina lock Tomas Lavanini was sent off for a high shot on Owen Farrell after 18 minutes and, from thereon in, this victory was a formality.\n\nEngland put on an impressive display to become the first side to book their place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals\n\nThe big talking point from the game arrived early when Nigel Owens showed Tomas Lavanini (left) a straight red card\n\nThe Argentina No 5 produced a dangerous high tackle on England fly-half Owen Farrell as his shoulder connected to the head\n\nLavanini was left in tears as he walked off the pitch at the Tokyo Stadium having known he had left his side with work to do\n\nMATCH FACTS England: 39 points Tries: May, Daly, B Youngs, Ford, Nowell, Cowan-Dickie Conversions: Owen Farrell (3) Argentina: 10 points Tries: Mat\u00edas Moroni Conversions: Emiliano Boffelli (1)\n\nNext week's game with France will now be a battle for top-spot and perhaps a chance to gauge of England's mettle.\n\nThe Pumas had promised a 'war' but they fired few shots in England's red zone.\n\nTopping 30C, it was one of the hottest days of the tournament so far as English fans poured out of Tobitayku metro station, all red cheeks and sweat patches.\n\nFor the Argentinians, it felt just like summer in Buenos Aires. The bounced and sang and basked in the sunshine \u2013 even as their side slipped away on the scoreboard.\n\nFortunately for England, night falls early in Tokyo and Eddie Jones' side set out to dictate the tempo as the air cooled.\n\nRevved up from the dressing room, the Pumas took an early 3-0 lead but that was as good as it got.\n\nThe old rivals saw tempers fray between them throughout a feisty first half where a huge scuffle broke out on the ground\n\nPlayers had to be separated on a number of occasions with officials urging the squads to gain some composure in Tokyo\n\nJonny May got England on their way with a well-worked try after a switch from right to left saw George Ford pick him out\n\nBilly Vunipola dropped the ball in contact and No 10 Benjamin Urdapilleta spotted Jamie George out on the wing. He kicked into a pocket of space for Matias Moroni, who would have scored the first try but for some desperate cover defence by Jonny May to ground the ball.\n\nWith four minutes on the clock, the two packs set down the first, eagerly-anticipated scrum. The set-piece had been the focus of debate all week \u2013 who would creak first? \u2013 and George Kruis gave Kyle Sinckler a pat on the shoulder as the two packs prepared to engage.\n\nNeither gave an inch, so Javier Ortega Desio picked from the base and eventually won a penalty for a no-arms tackle by Sinckler. Urdipilata kicked the opening points but the rest was largely one way traffic.\n\nIf analysts had spotted one glaring weakness in the English ranks, it is their high-ball defensive cover in the backfield. Neither Tonga or the USA had put England under strain but, here, Elliot Daly had the answer with solid positional play in one of his best displays at No 15.\n\nEngland's first try came when Daly ran back a limp kick, flaunting his football skills with a chip over the top of an onrushing defender. England gained valuable territory, with Maro Itoje claiming the ball at the tail of the lineout. George Ford switched play and Jonny May scored down the left wing.\n\nThere was talk of rugby warfare before kick-off.\n\nFord (left) let out a celebratory roar with May (middle) after securing the first try of the game against Argentina's 14-men\n\nEngland's man advantage continued to cause Argentina real problems as Elliot Daly was next to cross for a try for England\n\nFarrell, having taken that early high tackle from Lavanini, struggled kicking initially before finding his range in the second half\n\nArgentina, eyes bulging, had promised physicality and 27-men piled into a brawl after Pablo Matera's late hit on Ben Youngs. Moments later, hot-headed lock Tomas Lavanini lined up Owen Farrell. He locked his eyes onto the England captain and landed his left shoulder square on Farrell's head.\n\nRed card. Lavanini trudged off the pitch, hands on hips, before kicking a water bottle with the look of a man who had just cost his team the World Cup. Referee Nigel Owens was left with no other option \u2013 although moments later Manu Tuilagi was thanking his lucky stars for avoiding a yellow card for tackling Emiliano Boffelli in the air.\n\nEngland had their foot on Puma throats but they took a while to make it count. Farrell missed four kicks at goal in the first-half \u2013 cueing the debate about whether he needed an HIA - and Billy Vunipola struggled through the end of the break with heavy strapping on his right ankle.\n\nWith 36 minutes on the clock, England did eventually make their extra man pay. After Itoje was held up, play switched from right to left. Daly juggled a pass from Farrell, before finding his balance to hitch-kicking through two defenders to score.\n\nArgentina would have settled for the 10-3 deficit at half time but, with the clock two minutes in the red, England built pressure through 20 phases before Ben Youngs sniped through the last line of defence for England's third.\n\nMaro Itoje (middle) was at the heart of the action for England as they looked to gain an early advantage given the humidity\n\nBen Youngs added a try of his own on the stroke of half-time in what was a major moment for England's bonus point hopes\n\nManu Tuilagi (right) raised both arms in celebration as he saw team-mate Youngs evade the challenge to cross the try line\n\nWorrying, Vunipola was hooked at half-time and did not re-emerge after the final whistle.\n\nEngland changed out of their sweat-soaked jerseys and came out to turn the screw. They suffocated the Pumas with grunting challenges by Joe Marler and Sam Underhill, while George Ford applied the grace with pinpoint kicking from hand.\n\nTom Curry switched to No 8 and England attacked from a scrum. Manu Tuilagi sucked in four defenders with a powerful carry, before Ford was left to dive over for a short-range, bonus-point try. Farrell eventually found his range from the kicking tee and, after 63 minutes, England fans rejoiced at the uplifting sight of Mako Vunipola returning from injury to replace Marler from the bench.\n\nJack Nowell followed five minutes later, to warm applause, safe in the knowledge that the job had been done.\n\nArgentina opened up in the closing 10 minutes, scoring through Matias Moroni, but it was England who had the final say. Wearing his blue scrum-hat, the winger collected a miss pass from Farrell, before stepping in and out to bounce off his defender to score.\n\nThen Luke Cowan-Dickie piled over to score in the final play and \u2013 having promised 'war' \u2013 all hell broke loose on the final whistle as the game ended with another brawl.\n\nThere were plenty in England red and white inside a packed-out Tokyo Stadium as England reach the tournament's last eight\n\nAfter a stop-start and scrappy first half, England came out the blocks quickly and Ford did brilliantly to get an early try", "description": "NIK SIMON AT THE TOKYO STADIUM: England showed their credentials against Argentina as Eddie Jones' side ensured safe progression to the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/10/19328198-0-image-a-105_1570268050918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
