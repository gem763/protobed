He was wrong Read more\n\nAt the same time as calling for an investigation of the former vice-president and frontrunner in the Democratic primary, Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, Trump noted that the US was in trade talks with China and \u201cif they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power\u201d.\n\nAsked if he had already asked China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, to start an investigation, the president said: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u201d\n\nThe president was speaking as his former special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, was giving evidence to House committees about what he knew about parallel contacts with Kyiv conducted by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and aimed exclusively at obtaining compromising material on the Bidens.\n\nHunter Biden was on the board of an energy company in the eastern European country, where Joe Biden, as vice-president, pressed for the dismissal of the chief prosecutor. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by father or son.\n\nWhat happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine Donald Trump\n\nTrump has insisted he did nothing wrong in his dealings with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelinskiy, and has even accused an intelligence whistleblower of treason for providing evidence that the president used the power of his office \u2013 the withholding of military aid and a summit meeting \u2013 for his own political ends.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to do just that in front of the cameras on the White House lawn on Thursday, when he openly called for Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIf they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nOn a 2013 trip to China, the then vice-president took his son with him on his official plane. The younger Biden was in the process of setting up a private equity fund, BHR, with money coming in part from Chinese investors.\n\nHunter Biden later acknowledged having met a prospective partner during the trip, though a spokesperson told NBC News it was a social encounter.\n\nThere is no evidence the Bidens did anything illegal.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump also noted that Chinese negotiators are due in Washington for the latest round of high-stakes trade talks, and threatened negative consequences if Chinese leaders did not make concessions.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are coming in next week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a meeting with them, we\u2019ll see, but we\u2019re doing very well. I have a lot of options on China. But if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.\u201d\n\nBeijing has shown itself to be sensitive to Trump family dynamics.\n\nIn 2018, Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion and homewares business received initial Chinese approval for trademark applications days before her father announced a reversal in policy, dropping a US ban against ZTE, a Chinese telecoms firm that admitted breaking US sanctions on Iran and North Korea.\n\nTrump\u2019s China comments seemed likely to broaden the impeachment inquiry, which is already at fever pitch in Congress.\n\nHe feels he can do anything with impunity Adam Schiff\n\nEarlier on Thursday, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to speaker Nancy Pelosi, demanding she suspend the inquiry until more \u201ctransparent and equitable rules and procedures\u201d are established.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cUnfortunately, you have given no clear indication as to how your impeachment inquiry will proceed \u2013 including whether key historical precedents or basic standards of due process will be observed.\u201d\n\nBut the inquiry continued and journalists lined a spiral staircase that descended to a secure room in the bowels of the Capitol where Volker was testifying in closed session before members of three committees.\n\nThe session ran well into the afternoon. Democrats emerging from the room refused to comment. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio, issued a statement targeted at the Democratic chairman of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff.\n\nVolker\u2019s testimony has not \u201cadvanced Schiff\u2019s impeachment agenda\u201d, Turner said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Schiff speaks to reporters as Kurt Volker, Donald Trump\u2019s former envoy to Ukraine, is interviewed in nearby offices. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nEmerging from the hearing after several hours, Schiff declined to comment on Volker\u2019s testimony. But he called Trump\u2019s remarks on the White House lawn \u201crepugnant\u201d and a \u201cfundamental breach of the president\u2019s oath of office\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump's bizarre press day was a full-blown impeachment tantrum Read more\n\n\u201cOnce again,\u201d he said, \u201chaving the president of the United States suggesting, urging a foreign country to interfere in our presidential elections is an illustration that if this president has learned anything from the two years of the Mueller investigation is that he feels he can do anything with impunity.\u201d\n\nOn a visit to Arizona, Vice-President Mike Pence defended Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy \u2013 even as his aides sought to distance him from the rapidly unfolding scandal. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Pence\u2019s top national security adviser, Keith Kellogg, listened in on the call from the Situation Room.\n\nPence told reporters: \u201cAs more facts come out of this, as people take time to read the transcript of the president\u2019s call and reflect on these facts, they\u2019ll come to realise this is more of the same of what we\u2019ve seen from Democrats in the last two and a half years.\u201d\n\nEchoing Trump, he insisted that the real wrongdoing was on the part of Biden.\n\n\u201cI think the American people have a right to know if the vice-president of the United States and his family profited off of his position,\u201d he said.", "description": "President, who is facing an impeachment inquiry over similar behavior with Ukraine, warns \u2018If they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous power\u2019", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6be6da9fa5c03feca8bef50dd3759bf9e46430d9/0_22_1798_1078/master/1798.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=618d4dca1693f36d486f6d17cc7e01dd"}
