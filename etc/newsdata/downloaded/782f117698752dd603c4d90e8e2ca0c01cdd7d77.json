He then questioned whether Saudi Arabia was ready to fight \"to the last American soldier.\"\n\n\"This is not the first time Iran's foreign minister has said something ridiculous and frankly laughable,\" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh on Saturday.\n\nHis comments come amid a state of heightened tension between Saudi Arabia, Iran and the U.S. following drone and missile attacks on two Saudi oil facilities a week ago. The attacks, claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, shut down half of Saudi Arabia's oil production.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S. have suggested that Iran had a role in, or was responsible for, the attack on Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq and Khurais oil facility. Iran has denied the accusations, calling them \"meaningless\" and \"pointless.\"\n\nBoth the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have stopped short of any retaliatory action against Iran, although on Friday the Pentagon announced that it will deploy additional U.S. troops and missile defense equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAl-Jubeir said the strikes represented attacks not just on Saudi Arabia but on the entire international community.\n\nExtensive repair work is underway on the two damaged oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Aramco's Chief Executive Amin Nasser has reportedly told employees of the state oil giant that the company had emerged from attacks on its oil facilities \"stronger than ever\" and added that full oil production would resume by the end of this month.", "description": "", "authors": ["Natasha Turak Holly Ellyatt", "Natasha Turak", "Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105586617-1542802712473gettyimages-904318920.jpeg?v=1569059351", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
