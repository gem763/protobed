The former mayor said on Friday he was.\n\nGiuliani is under pressure over his extra-governmental role in Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a potential opponent in the 2020 election, over unfounded allegations of corruption involving the former vice-president\u2019s son.\n\nThe Ukraine scandal is driving a formal impeachment inquiry by Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\nTwo Soviet-born US citizens, both associates of Giuliani, were arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of campaign finance violations, while trying to leave the US on one-way tickets.\n\nOn Friday, the New York Times reported that Giuliani himself was under federal investigation over his work on and in Ukraine. The same paper also reported that in 2017 Giuliani tried to get a client released as part of a prisoner swap with Turkey, a move blocked by Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.\n\nSuch a one-sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful! Donald Trump\n\nTrump has seemed recently to begin to distance himself from Giuliani, amid reports that allies of the president want the voluble former mayor to keep quiet.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry run by House Democrats is gathering pace, dragging the state department and senior diplomats into a morass of hearings, subpoenas and bare-knuckle political fights.\n\nOn Friday the former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified in private before House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, having defied White House and state department efforts to block her.\n\nDiscussing her controversial removal, Yovanovitch said: \u201cThe harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.\u201d\n\nAs he left the White House for a campaign rally in Louisiana, the president was asked if Giuliani was still his personal attorney.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy. I spoke to him yesterday briefly. He\u2019s a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney.\u201d\n\nGiuliani told the Washington Post he was still representing Trump. On Saturday, a Yahoo News reporter said he had \u201cjust texted\u201d with Giuliani, who said \u201che never worried Trump would cast him aside and attributed reports of a potential rift to people \u2018leaking to be malicious\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have questioned the common description of Giuliani as Trump\u2019s lawyer, given the apparently non-legal nature of his work. Giuliani has suggested attorney-client privilege would protect him from congressional scrutiny. That notion has been placed in doubt.\n\nTrump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is serving a three-year jail term for crimes including campaign finance violations he says were committed by order of his boss. It was reported this month that Cohen wants to write a tell-all book, once he regains his freedom.\n\nDonald Trump is a 'potty-mouth', says Nancy Pelosi Read more\n\nOn Saturday morning, after leaving the White House for his golf course in Sterling, Virginia, Trump tweeted: \u201cSo now they are after the legendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, 75, was mayor of New York from 1994 to 2001, earning lasting praise for his leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. In 2012, he briefly ran for the Republican presidential nomination. Before entering politics, he was a tough and successful US attorney for the southern district of New York \u2013 the office which is now investigating him.\n\n\u201cSuch a one[-]sided Witch Hunt going on in USA,\u201d Trump insisted on Saturday. \u201cDeep State. Shameful!\u201d\n\nThe reference to the \u201cDeep State\u201d was to a popular rightwing conspiracy theory which posits the existence of a permanent government of intelligence officials and bureaucrats, dedicated to stymying Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe former Trump campaign chair, White House strategist and Breitbart News supremo Steve Bannon, a prime mover behind the popularisation of the conspiracy, is on record as saying \u201cnone of this is true\u201d and the theory is \u201cfor nut cases\u201d.", "description": "Trump calls Giuliani \u2018greatest Mayor in the history of NYC\u2019, after having appeared to distance himself a day earlier", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0ac411e00fcb4aabc7336bd51879d312b94738/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bde6664c8f41f54ed0de732fac9e5adf", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
