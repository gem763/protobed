'Post offices provide such a lifeline for so many people particularly in rural areas where there has been a tendency not to be a bank anyway.\n\n'The opening hours tend to be longer than at banks. Access to finance is so useful for elderly people and people without transport.\n\n'The Post Office has been really helpful to people getting access to cash and carrying out their day-to- day financial transactions so, yes, I am disappointed.'\n\nBusiness secretary Andrea Leadsom described Barclays' decision to ban its customers from taking out cash through Post Offices as 'very disappointing'\n\nWhen asked whether she would call upon the bank to reconsider, she said: 'I just did.' Leadsom was speaking as she launched a new small and medium business charter signed by leading banks \u2013 including Barclays \u2013 which have promised to support firms through Brexit.\n\nThe banks have set aside billions for lending and support for firms and have pledged they are 'open for business and ready to lend'.\n\nBut Barclays' proposals to forbid its customers to take out cash through their local post offices has provoked widespread condemnation.\n\nThe controversial move is also a blow to the struggling post office network.\n\nBanking services are a vital source of income for postmasters, the independent businessmen who run local post offices.\n\nAs many as 2,500 of them said that they are considering resigning or downsizing in the next year because of the financial hardship they experience, according to a recent survey.\n\nBarclays, which made \u00a33.5billion profits last year, is estimated to have shut more than 480 branches in the past five years, or around a third of its total.\n\n'I've been a customer for 75 years and i feel betrayed' Retired nurse Sylvia Walton, a Barclays customer of 75 years, says she feels 'betrayed' by the bank's decision to stop customers withdrawing cash at their local Post Offices Retired nurse Sylvia Walton, 91, feels 'betrayed' by Barclays' decision to stop customers withdrawing cash at local post offices, writes Fiona Parker. The Barclays customer of 75 years withdraws her pension every week from the post office, which is two minutes' walk from her home. Sylvia, pictured in her nurse's uniform, opened a Barclays account when she was 16 Her nearest bank branch is five miles away in Stowmarket. Mrs Walton, from Elmswell, Suffolk, said: 'Barclays is betraying customers like myself. 'I am lucky as I can still drive, but I don't know how long I will be able to and there are a lot of elderly and vulnerable people who rely on the post office. January is an especially inconsiderate time to axe the service, when the weather is worse and roads can be dangerous.' Mrs Walton, who is a widow, added: 'Barclays is still making profits, but is not taking customers into consideration. The great-grandmother, who opened an account with Barclays when she was 16, added: 'I spent my career caring for people and I know how disabled and older people rely on these services.'\n\nRachel Reeves, the Labour chairman of the business select committee, said: 'This unjustifiable decision from Barclays to stop customers accessing their own money from post offices is a deeply retrograde step.\n\n'It lets down customers, undermines the post office network, and potentially leaves people in many places without access to their own cash.\n\n'It's essential that the future viability of the post office network is secured, and unfortunately this decision from Barclays suggests they are forgetting their wider social responsibilities.'\n\nThe National Federation of Sub-Postmasters also condemned the bank, accusing it of 'hypocrisy, greed and contempt for its customers'.\n\nIts chief executive Calum Greenhow said removing cash withdrawal services was 'damaging to communities across the UK'.\n\nHe added: 'Barclays are telling their customers: 'We don't care about you.' They are telling sub-postmasters: 'We don't care about you.'\n\n'The bank needs to locate its moral compass and reverse this decision before it is too late.'\n\nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron MP said: 'Barclays is throwing our local communities under a bus \u2013 especially after closing branches in local towns in my Lake District constituency.\n\nHe added that he would write to Leadsom and Barclays chief executive Jes Staley demanding that Barclays change its mind.\n\nMartin Kearsley, head of banking at the Post Office, said that he was 'disappointed'.\n\nBarclays hit back by promising it would not close branches in remote areas, where it is the last in town, for two years.\n\nThe move will protect 100 ring-fenced branches until October 2021, the company said.\n\nIts customers will also be able to get cashback from businesses in 200 remote towns and areas without a bank branch or ATM within half a mile.\n\nBut critics said this was 'a token gesture'. The Barclays decision will remove cash withdrawal from 6,100 rural post offices.", "description": "The business secretary (pictured), last night slammed Barclays' decision to ban its customers from taking out cash through Post Offices and called on the bank to think again.", "authors": ["Ruth Sunderland", "Tom Witherow For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
