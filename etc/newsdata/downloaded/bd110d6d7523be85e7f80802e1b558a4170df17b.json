Forty children have died after being left alone in a hot vehicle so far in 2019, according to the National Safety Council.\n\nInterested in Hot Car Deaths?

There was a record 53 deaths recorded in 2018.\n\nThis week the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers announced that automakers would voluntary add rear seat warnings to new vehicles.\n\nThese alerts could be a combination of \u201cauditory and visual alerts\u201d that will turn on after the driver turns off the vehicle. The auto industry has committed, according to the auto alliance, to have a rear seat alert system in place in \u201cessentially\u201d all new cars and trucks by model year 2025.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/AP Photo\n\n\u201cAutomakers have been exploring ways to address this safety issue and this commitment underscores how such innovations and increased awareness can help children right now,\u201d Alliance Interim President and CEO David Schwietert said in a statement.\n\nThe National Safety Council praised the automakers\u2019 decision but said it needs to move quickly in order to save lives.\n\n\u201cAutomakers took a step in the right direction Wednesday, adding another layer of protection against these tragedies,\u201d the council said in a statement. \u201cAutomakers should move fast on their commitment and continue to collaborate on additional protections that can be provided to all our drivers.\u201d\n\nFrom 1998-2018 the National Safety Council said nearly 800 children have died in hot cars: 53.8% of hot car deaths were because the children were forgotten, 26.3% died after gaining access unknowingly and 18.6% died after being knowingly left in the car.\n\nKidsaAndCars.org said the auto alliance\u2019s plan falls short because the alerts don\u2019t address \u201cnearly a third\u201d of hot car deaths that involve children gaining access to the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThis is an outrageous attempt by the automakers to avoid an enforceable safety standard,\u201d Joan Claybrook, former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a news release. \u201cThey should have added detection systems to their vehicles decades ago when auto manufacturers told all parents to move their children to the back seat due to the decision of some automakers to install overpowered airbags.\u201d\n\nKidsandCars also said the voluntary agreement is \u201cnon-binding and unenforceable,\u201d so there\u2019s no way to hold automakers accountable to follow through on their commitment.\n\n\u201cWhile the public waits for these systems to be offered as standard equipment at the pace determined by the manufacturers, families continue burying children week after week after week,\u201d the organization said.\n\nChildren as young as 5 days and as old as 14 years have died in hot car deaths. More than half of those deaths were children under the age of 2.\n\nChildren should never be left alone in a car, even if parents think they\u2019ll be just a few minutes, the Safety Council said. On a 70-degree day, it takes only 15 minutes for the car to reach 96 degrees. On an 80-degree, it takes only 10 minutes to reach 100 degrees.\n\nIf you see a child alone in a car, call 911.", "description": "The U.S. has already 40 hot car deaths in 2019, surpassing the yearly average.
