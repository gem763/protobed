He is a very cheerful baby indeed.'\n\nEnchanting Sasha is described as 'unique' because most babies born with the condition also have multiple other ailments.\n\nThe Russian boy has two benign cysts on his forehead which soon will be removed.\n\nHe is believed to suffer in extreme form from rare SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome which afflicts one in a quarter of a million.\n\nRussian medics say Sasha is one of only three babies registered in the world with no eyeballs at all.\n\nBaby Sasha (left and right) with a nurse at Tomsk specialised children orphanage in the Siberian city of Tomsk where he is being cared for. The search is on for a new loving home for the eight-month-old\n\nThere are two other cases of babies born without eyes registered in the world, according to doctors. The most well-documented of them is 'miracle' baby Archie Innes from the United Kingdom (above)\n\nTomsk doctor Tatiana Rudnikovich said: 'Sasha is going through all regular check ups and tests like any other baby of his age. He is doing well.'\n\nHowever, medics say there is currently 'no chance' that Sasha will ever see.\n\nHis adoption listing says the boy is 'a peaceful, smiling baby'.\n\n'He smiles back as soon as he hears familiar voices. His mother signed his refusal papers in the maternity hospital.\n\n'There is no information about Alexander's father and there is a 'dash' in his birth certificate where it should have been a name of the father.\n\n'Alexander is up for adoption or foster care.'\n\nThe child is initially up for adoption with Russian parents but if no-one suitable comes forward, he could go to foreign parents.\n\nCurrently there are restrictions to adoptions to the US.\n\nSasha is believed to suffer in extreme form from rare SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome which afflicts one in a quarter of a million\n\nHis adoption listing says the baby boy is 'a peaceful, smiling baby'. He will need operations every six months or so to prevent his face becoming deformed\n\nThe boy's carer nurse recently took him 2,500 miles to St Petersburg where surgeons implanted tiny eye orbs to ensure that his face is not deformed as he grows, reported The Siberian Times.\n\nHe will need such operations every six months or so, each time with larger orbs.\n\nThere are only two other cases of babies born without eyes registered in the world.\n\nThe most well-documented is 'miracle' baby Archie Innes, now two, born to Scottish parents Fiona and Steven Gould who currently live in Sydney, Australia.\n\nHis mother was told about Archie's condition 31 weeks into her pregnancy, say reports.\n\nIn Archie's case, he also has severe gross motor delay, mild-to-moderate hearing impairment, and moderate aspiration.", "description": "Despite little Alexander K - known as Sasha - being born without eyes, he is otherwise healthy.
