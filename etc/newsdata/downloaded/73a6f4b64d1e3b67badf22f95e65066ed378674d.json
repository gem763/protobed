One-handed games that are a natural fit for a phone aren\u2019t an issue for me, but tapping and swiping in games with complex control schemes can be maddening.\n\nThe Black Shark 2, a Xiaomi-made gaming phone released in China earlier this year, reduces that friction with its MagicTouch feature. It relies on the phone\u2019s pressure-sensitive display to let you reassign controls to a more convenient location on the screen. It works similarly to 3D Touch on the iPhone, changing the screen\u2019s response depending on how hard you push on it, except it\u2019s more useful. MagicTouch can be activated in-game by swiping in from the top right corner of the screen while gaming in landscape mode (games in portrait mode, like Pok\u00e9mon Go, aren\u2019t supported). Its interface asks you to choose which two button mappings you\u2019d like to change, and where you\u2019d like them to live on the screen. Obviously, how you choose to customize is up to you, but the idea here is to reduce, if not eliminate, awkward finger movements during gameplay.\n\nOur review of Xiaomi Black Shark 2 Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Fast performance for a reasonable price\n\nMagicTouch makes gaming more enjoyable Bad Stuff It\u2019s months behind on security updates\n\nThe design won\u2019t appeal to most Buy for $599.99 from Amazon\n\nPUBG on mobile is a great example to focus on. It\u2019s already designed with tremendous control customization, allowing players to change the location of literally every button, as well as their size and transparency. Where MagicTouch compliments it is by letting me make two multifunction buttons, made possible with the phone\u2019s pressure-sensitive touchscreen.\n\nOriginally, PUBG\u2019s controls put the \u201cSprint\u201d button where your finger naturally rests to move the character. I\u2019d prefer to be able to sway my avatar left and right to avoid gunfire, while managing inventory on the right side of the screen. Usually, that involves tapping the \u201cInventory\u201d button near the bottom corner of the screen. MagicTouch lets me create a secondary action right over the \u201cSprint\u201d button that, when I press the screen hard enough, opens the inventory on the right side without lifting a finger.\n\nMagicTouch lets you customize one button on the right side, too, and for PUBG, I knew exactly what else I wanted to change. You can already move the camera, whether in third- or first-person view, by moving a finger around in the right half of the screen. That\u2019s fine, but I don\u2019t want to have to lift that finger to find the \u201cFire\u201d button when I stumble upon another player. So, I anchored a MagicTouch button to this part of the screen that fires my weapon when I press hard enough. It feels like this is the way the game is intended to be played.\n\nMagicTouch isn\u2019t limited to PUBG. You can use it on any landscape-oriented game that has controls that you\u2019d like to customize and developers don\u2019t have to do anything special to their games to enable it. However, due to its reliance on the Black Shark\u2019s 2 pressure-sensitive screen, it\u2019s limited to just this phone. Most popular Android phones don\u2019t have screens that support something like this, so it wouldn\u2019t work even if this software was released on the Google Play Store. To try out the feature yourself, you\u2019ll have to buy the phone.\n\nYou can get it for $599.99 at Amazon, and that\u2019s not prohibitively expensive for a phone with specs like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855, the latest processor found in 2019 Android flagship phones. It has 8GB of RAM, and an in-display fingerprint sensor, too, so it\u2019s right up there with the likes of the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10 in terms of hardware features.\n\nCool as the MagicTouch feature is, though, the Black Shark 2 isn\u2019t the best choice if you live in the US. The phone only works with GSM carriers, like AT&T and T-Mobile; Verizon and Sprint won\u2019t work. And, there is no warranty support in the US.\n\nThe Black Shark 2 runs Android 9 Pie, and it\u2019s free of bloat, which is a good thing. Surprisingly, the interface is largely \u201cstock,\u201d and isn\u2019t Xiaomi\u2019s (Black Shark\u2019s parent company) MIUI interface. But Xiaomi has failed to deliver security updates on a regular basis. As of time of publishing, it\u2019s on the February 2019\u2019s security patch.\n\nIf those issues haven\u2019t turned you off, its design might. Black Shark 2 is built for gaming, and while that doesn\u2019t have to necessitate garish looks, this phone is full of divisive hardware details. A bright green chamfered edge runs all the way around the phone, and the back of the Black Shark 2 looks like a flashy sports car. Google\u2019s Pixel phones usually get flak for their two-toned design, but Xiaomi\u2019s blend of metal and glass is truly something. It even has an illuminated logo on its back and a light-up strip on the side \u2014 nigh obligatory inclusions for anything marketed toward gamers.\n\nGrid View Photo by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPhoto by James Bareham / The Verge\n\nPressure-sensitive screens are usually a gimmick. On iPhones, 3D Touch in iOS is useful on paper, though Apple hasn\u2019t done a great job of justifying its existence. Some power users may enjoy it, since it can let users get more done with fewer taps, but most people likely don\u2019t even know it exists.\n\nBlack Shark\u2019s application of this sort of tech is still mostly a gimmick. Its utility will vary depending on what games you like to play, and you won\u2019t get much use out of it if you\u2019re already an ace at playing games on a touchscreen. But personally, it was revelatory. Instead of logging onto Twitter every few minutes, for a lack of anything better to do on my phone, I actually felt the rare pull to play a mobile game.\n\nI have more fun when I play with MagicTouch. I wasn\u2019t expecting much, but now I don\u2019t want to play a mobile game without it.", "description": "The Black Shark 2 is a lot like other flagship phones, but its pressure-sensitive screen sets it apart.
