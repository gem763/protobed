Let\u2019s be honest: It wouldn\u2019t be much an awards show if it didn\u2019t. From the quiet end of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the unexpected performance of \u201cFleabag,\u201d from a couple of touching, rousing speeches to one gut-twistingly awkward red-carpet moment, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Sunday\u2019s award show.\n\n\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 goes out with a whimper, not a bang\n\n\n\nThe cast and crew of \"Game Of Thrones\" accepts the award for outstanding drama series. (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nThe behemoth has been something of an unstoppable force since it burst onto HBO in 2011 and helped the last remnants of a monoculture hang on for a few years. The show continuously broke records, such as when it won the most Primetime Emmys in a single year in 2015 and then became the most-awarded series in Emmy history in 2016. The show has racked up more than 50 Emmy statuettes, and this year, it earned a record-breaking 32 nominations for a single season.\n\nIt didn\u2019t exactly clean up, though, winning only 12 of those awards \u2014 including outstanding drama series and a supporting actor win for Peter Dinklage on Sunday night on top of its 10 trophies from last weekend\u2019s Creative Arts Emmys. (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is the only show that can win a dozen Emmys and yet somehow still kind of feel like a failure.) A few factors may have been the cause: maybe because the final season was generally reviled; maybe because it split votes by having multiple entries in many categories; maybe there\u2019s a GoT fatigue that finally settled in. We probably won\u2019t know, at least not until the prequels air.\n\n[Review: Emmy night proved two things: TV shows are great right now and some awards shows really, really need a host]\n\n\u2018Fleabag\u2019 cleans up\n\n\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge holds her Emmys. She created, writes and stars in \"Fleabag.\" (Nina Prommer/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nThe Emmys are often criticized for being entirely too predictable, which makes it the opposite of Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s \u201cFleabag,\u201d a show as unpredictably emotional as it is hilarious. Waller-Bridge, who also wrote the first season of \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d caught the eye of many American audiences when the first season of \u201cFleabag,\u201d which she created, writes and stars in, hit Amazon in 2016. That its second season had such a long gestation period is often the sign of a creatively defunct project. In this case, it was completely the opposite, delighting (and emotionally crushing) critics and fans alike. The Emmys surprised us all by giving it four awards Sunday (in addition to two from the Creative Arts ceremonies), including a shocking victory for Waller-Bridge over Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the outstanding lead actress in a comedy category. Maybe the awards show has picked up a few of Waller-Bridge\u2019s tricks.\n\nMichelle Williams\u2019s powerful speech on pay parity\n\nThe \u201cFosse/Verdon\u201d star\u2019s win for best lead actress in a limited series gave way to a powerful speech on pay parity and the importance of women feeling valued in the workplace.\n\n\u201cI see this as an acknowledgment of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feel safe enough to voice them, and respected enough that they\u2019ll be heard,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen I asked for more dance classes, I heard yes; more voice lessons, yes; a different wig, a pair of fake teeth \u2014 not made out of rubber. And all of these things, they require effort and they cost more money, but my bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed in order to do my job and honor Gwen Verdon.\n\n\u201cAnd so, I want to say thank you so much to FX and to Fox 21 Studios for supporting me completely and for paying me equally,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cBecause they understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value. And then, where do they put that value? They put it in their work.\n\n\u201cThe next time a woman \u2014 and especially a woman of color, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterparts \u2014 tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her, believe her,\u201d Williams added. \u201cBecause one day, she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\"\n\nUSA Today reported last year that Williams, who has been acting since she was a child, had received around $1,000 for reshoots on Ridley Scott\u2019s 2017 film \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d while her co-star Mark Wahlberg received $1.5 million. The actress addressed the issue this year on Capitol Hill, where she recalled feeling \u201cparalyzed in feelings of futility\u201d after discovering the large gap in their pay.\n\nThe long-standing dominance of \u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019 and \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 continues\n\n\n\nLorne Michaels and the cast and crew of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d accept the award for outstanding variety sketch series. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking of seemingly unstoppable shows, \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver\u201d won outstanding variety talk series for its fourth straight year, which is particularly impressive when you consider that it\u2019s only been on television since 2014. SNL, meanwhile, might be an older show, but it has been cleaning up lately as well. It earned its 67th Emmy on Sunday when it nabbed outstanding variety sketch series for the third time in three years (not to mention a third straight win for its director, Don Roy King). It\u2019s tough not to see what both shows have in common: comedically critical crosshairs focused on the Trump administration.\n\nThomas Lennon\u2019s voice-overs \u2014 in lieu of a host\n\nSince there was no host this year, actor and screenwriter Thomas Lennon served as the ceremony\u2019s de facto emcee, in voice-over only. His asides, which drew mixed reviews on social media, included a particularly brutal \u201cshout out to past best actress winners who may be watching from prison.\u201d That was a thinly veiled reference to Felicity Huffman, who won a best lead actress Emmy for \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d in 2005, and recently received a two-week prison sentence for paying $15,000 to increase her daughter\u2019s SAT scores.\n\nLennon also joked that \u201cChernobyl was filmed in Studio City, California, in front of a live audience,\u201d and directed several zingers at Amazon\u2019s massive budget, suggesting more than once that \u201cFleabag\u201d could afford to be filmed in space. At one point, he noted that a few nominees had the potential to make history. \u201cAre the Emmys woke or is that just something that,\u201d Lennon started before pivoting to a joke about the show\u2019s lack of a host: \u201cThis is why people don\u2019t do this \u2014 because it sucks.\u201d\n\nBilly Porter\u2019s historic, EGOT-paving win\n\nPorter, the first out gay man to win an Emmy for best lead actor in a drama, received a standing ovation \u2014 with particularly loud cheers from his \u201cPose\u201d castmates \u2014 as he took the stage.\n\n\u201cI gotta read,\u201d he told the audience, adding glasses to his ensemble that included a sparkly suit from Michael Kors couture, an angled hat from Stephen Jones millinery and platform boots by Rick Owens.\n\n\u201cThe category is love, ya\u2019ll, love,\u201d Porter began. \u201cI am so overwhelmed and I am so overjoyed to have lived long enough to see this day. James Baldwin said, \u2018It took many years of vomiting up all the filth that I have been taught about myself and halfway believed before I could walk around this Earth like I have the right to be here.\u2019 I have the right. You have the right. We all have the right.\u201d\n\nAfter thanking his fellow nominees, family and his manager of 29 years, Porter thanked \u201cPose\u201d co-creator Ryan Murphy. \u201cYou saw me, you believed in us,\u201d he told the prolific TV writer-producer. Porter also had a message for his colleagues. \u201cWe as artists are the people that get to change the molecular structure of the hearts and minds of the people who live on this planet,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever stop doing that. Please don\u2019t ever stop telling the truth.\u201d\n\nPorter is now one step closer to the esteemed EGOT, having won a Tony in 2013 for \u201cKinky Boots\u201d and a Grammy the following year for the Broadway show\u2019s album.\n\n[The complete list of 2019 Emmy Award winners]\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus denied a history-making Emmy\n\nLouis-Dreyfus won six consecutive Emmys for lead actress in a comedy for her role as Selina Meyer in HBO\u2019s satirical \u201cVeep.\u201d She also scored one in the same category for \u201cThe New Adventures of Old Christine,\u201d and one for supporting actress for \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d That put the 58-year-old even for the record of most wins for acting Emmys with Cloris Leachman (who is 93). So it was easy to bet on Louis-Dreyfus taking home the gold, especially because it was the final season of the show and came later than planned after she received a breast cancer diagnosis for which she is now in remission. But in a shocking twist, Phoebe Waller-Bridge snatched the Emmy as part of her surprising \u201cFleabag\u201d run. Let\u2019s just hope Louis-Dreyfus is more easygoing than her character.\n\nJenny McCarthy was, uh, something on the red (purple) carpet\n\nJenny McCarthy pretends she's years younger than the always stellar Christina Applegate (their ages are within one year of each other). Then she commends her on her first Emmy nomination, when in fact she was nominated for the show \"Samantha Who.\" #Emmys2019 pic.twitter.com/xR5NDLEQYw \u2014 Darcy (Leda) (@MeAndNoArmy) September 23, 2019\n\nRemember Jenny McCarthy, that MTV personality who became infamous for her anti-vaccination views? Well, now the \u201cMasked Singer\u201d judge is a red-carpet interviewer, we guess \u2014 and trust us, that\u2019s not a good thing. To list all her faux pas here would require more space than even the Internet provides, so let\u2019s just focus on her interview with Christina Applegate in which she said she watched the actress as a child and wanted to grow up just to be like her (Applegate is one year older than McCarthy), before asking how it felt for Applegate to have her first lead-actress nomination (it was her third). She also asked Julia Louis-Dreyfus to do the Elaine dance, a request the actress denied before quickly walking away.\n\nWait, what exactly is \u2018Ozark\u2019?\n\nIf Twitter is any indication, Netflix\u2019s \u201cOzark,\u201d which won two of the five awards it was nominated for Sunday night, might not be all that popular. Netflix famously doesn\u2019t release its ratings, so we\u2019ll never know for sure. But for the uninitiated, the show features Jason Bateman as Marty Byrde, a Chicago financial planner who gets mixed up in some shady deals and ends up moving his family (Laura Linney, Sofia Hublitz and Skylar Gaertner) to a small community in the Ozarks. Things go bad, quickly. Think of it like a darker, moodier \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d on meth \u2014 it dives right into the most genre-y/action-filled parts and skips most of the philosophical moralizing.\n\nit's unsurprising that OZARK won an award, because it's a famed tv show we all know and love. I could tell you the plot of OZARK right now, but I won't, because what a redundant thing to do! Everyone knows what OZARK is and thinks it's great \u2014 David Sims (@davidlsims) September 23, 2019\n\nJharrel Jerome\u2019s emotional win\n\nThe 21-year-old actor earned his first Emmy \u2014 and a standing ovation \u2014 for his acclaimed performance as Korey Wise in Ava DuVernay\u2019s limited Netflix series, \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d And it\u2019s a historic honor: The Emmys noted on Twitter that Jerome is the second-youngest person to win in this category; Remezcla reported that Jerome, who is Dominican American, is the first Afro Latino to win an acting Emmy.\n\n\u201cI feel like I should just be in the Bronx right now chilling, waiting for my mom\u2019s cooking or something, but I\u2019m here in front of my inspirations. I\u2019m here in front of people who I\u2019m so motivated by \u2014 and the reason I\u2019m here is because of actors like the people I\u2019m in the category with,\u201d the actor said before thanking his mom (\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it without her\u201d), the rest of his family and DuVernay.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, this is for the men that we know as the Exonerated Five,\u201d Jerome continued, using the increasingly preferred moniker for the five men who were wrongly convicted as teens for the brutal 1989 assault of a jogger in Central Park. The men were in the audience and stood up to cheers as Jerome said their names: \u201cThis is for Raymond, Yusef, Antron, Kevin and king Korey Wise!\u201d\n\nActors who also write and/or direct cleaned up\n\n\n\nBill Hader accepts the award for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series for \"Barry.\" (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nThis year\u2019s ceremony clearly favored multitaskers, a group that included \u201cBarry\u201d co-creator Bill Hader, who won his second consecutive Emmy for best lead actor in a comedy series, and \u201cOzark\u201d star Jason Bateman, who won an Emmy for directing the Netflix drama\u2019s Season 2 opener (and was nominated for outstanding actor for his lead role in it). But no one can claim more range than Phoebe Waller-Bridge \u2014 the creator, writer and star of \u201cFleabag\u201d \u2014 who also served as the showrunner of \u201cKilling Eve\u2019s\u201d first season.\n\nAll of those \u2018Masked Singer\u2019 cross-promotions\n\nHey, did you know the \u201cMasked Singer\u201d was on Fox? No? Maybe? After Sunday\u2019s Emmys, it is kind of impossible to feign ignorance. The network hosted the awards show for the first time in a few years, and Fox made use of the airtime to plug its big reality singing competition show in some pretty awkward ways. A bunch of the characters walked the \u201cpurple carpet\u201d in 90-degree weather. There was the giant Thingamajig joining the very professional accountants onstage, there to represent the integrity of the vote-tallying process. And then there was that painful Tik Tok stunt. \u201cYou talk to Mariah Carey that much?\u201d Ken Jeong asked of Nick Cannon while trying to kill time. Yeesh.
