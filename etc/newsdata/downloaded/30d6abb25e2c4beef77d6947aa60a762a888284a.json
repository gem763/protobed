The events have \u201cset back the United States\u2019 campaign against the Islamic State and other terrorists. Unless halted, our retreat will invite the brutal Assad regime in Syria and its Iranian backers to expand their influence.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also noted that \u201cwe are ignoring Russia\u2019s efforts to leverage its increasingly dominant position in Syria to amass power and influence throughout the Middle East and beyond. ... Predictably, our adversaries seem to be relishing these developments.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky senator pointed to his experience working with three presidential administrations since the Sept. 11 terror attacks and learning that the threat from groups like the self-described Islamic State, also known as ISIS, \u201cis real and cannot be wished away,\u201d he warned.\n\nHe pointed out that the U.S. is \u201cnot in this fight alone,\u201d and has relied on local forces, including the Kurds, in the fight against ISIS. \u201cIronically, Syria had been a model for this increasingly successful approach,\u201d McConnell noted.\n\n\u201cWe saw humanitarian disaster and a terrorist free-for-all after we abandoned Afghanistan in the 1990s, laying the groundwork for 9/11,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe will see these things anew in Syria and Afghanistan if we abandon our partners and retreat from these conflicts before they are won.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Trump agreed to cede the battlefield in northeast Syria to Turkey, which began attacking Kurdish residents of the region almost immediately.\n\nRead McConnell\u2019s entire op-ed here.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
