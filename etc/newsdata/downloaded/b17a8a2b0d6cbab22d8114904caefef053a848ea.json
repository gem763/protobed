While the first of the trio will be available across all of NBN's fixed line technology, the latter two are currently slated to only be available on fibre-to-the-premises and HFC networks, with fibre-to-the-curb being considered.\n\nAt the lower end of the market, NBN said it would retain the same pricing for its 12/1 service, but reduce its charge to RSPs when \"average monthly peak CVC usage across [entry-level] services on a CVC is above 150Kbps\" from AU$22.50 to AU$5.70 per service. A partial waiver will be introduced on October 1 to allow the change to take effect, with the price to reduce down to AU$4.10 per service in October next year.\n\nThe company said from December it would also look to reduce service transfer fees from AU$22.50 to AU$5, as well as change the way CVC breaches are calculated and implemented.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nOptus takes wraps off customer concierge service to take NBN out of the equation\n\nSingle point of contact for customers moving onto NBN until 30 days after installation.\n\nVocus hoping ACCC can solve broadband affordability if NBN cannot\n\nVocus CEO Kevin Russell attacks the CVC as a download tax, saying the market value of NBN is far less than what it had cost to build.\n\nTelstra announces AU$400m revenue downgrade in wake of NBN corporate plan\n\nWith NBN connecting less people next year, Telstra will get AU$300 million less in payments.\n\nNBN shifts positive cash flow predictions out to 2023\n\nExtra AU$200 million of capital expenditure in 2022 sinks plan to be cash flow positive in 2022.\n\nNBN moves into Layer 3 with Sky Muster Plus launch\n\nBroadband wholesaler to exempt certain sites, email, and operating system updates from satellite data quota.", "description": "Network Extensions will initially only be available on fibre-to-the-node.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/01/21/239ab006-7fdc-4694-a431-65537ac99016/thumbnail/770x578/92259eb0ac03601eeb257229852c352b/traffic-lights.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
