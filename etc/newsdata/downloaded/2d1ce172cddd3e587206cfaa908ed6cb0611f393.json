(AP Photo/Noah Berger)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Latest on California wildfires (all times local):\n\n7:20 a.m.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library says it is being protected by firefighters as a wind-driven wildfire burns nearby in hills northwest of Los Angeles.\n\nMelissa Giller said Wednesday morning that the hilltop library in the city of Simi Valley is safe as the fire burns between Simi Valley and Moorpark, where evacuations have been ordered.\n\nGiller says the portion of the library closest to the fire is a pavilion housing a former Air Force One aircraft.\n\nThe portion of the library housing archives faces away from the fire.\n\nGiller says hundreds of goats are brought in each year to the library grounds as a fire prevention method so they can eat away vegetation that can fuel wildfires on the undeveloped portions of the 300-acre (121-hectare) property.\n\n___\n\n6:40 a.m.\n\nA large new wildfire has erupted in Southern California as strong Santa Ana winds blow through the region and officials ordered mandatory evacuations.\n\nTelevision images showed the fire burning before dawn Wednesday in the Simi Valley area about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nVentura County officials have tweeted that the brush fire is large without providing more details on its size and say it is burning between the cities of Simi Valley and Moorpark.\n\nMandatory evacuations were issued but officials did not say how many people were subject to the orders.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is in the vicinity.\n\n___\n\n6 a.m.\n\nFire danger warnings blanket a large swath of California because of gusty winds and extremely dry air.\n\nThe National Weather Service says Santa Ana winds developed more slowly than expected in Southern California but strong gusts topping 50 mph (80 kph) are being reported early Wednesday.\n\nSo far, the winds have stayed away from the section of Los Angeles that burned Monday in the Getty fire, where there's concern that smoldering embers could be carried away by gusts and start new fires.\n\nIn Northern California, winds are beginning to decline, but forecasters warn that fire danger remains.\n\nThe weather service says winds topped out near 70 mph (112 kph) at the highest elevations north of San Francisco Bay, where firefighters are battling the destructive Kincade Fire in the Sonoma County wine country.\n\n___\n\n10:43 p.m.\n\nCalifornians are facing winds, wildfires and darkness from yet another power outage for more than 1 million people.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric is blacking out about 1.5 million people in some 30 counties to prevent high winds from toppling power lines and sparking fires. It's the third shutoff in a week.\n\nA fire in northern wine country and another in the wealthy Brentwood area of Los Angeles have burned dozens of homes. Both were driven by strong winds.\n\nThe Sonoma County area was hit by gusts of 30 mph (48 kph) or more Tuesday but firefighters report little growth in the blaze, with winds were expected to ease Wednesday.\n\nBut in the south, forecasters say hot, dry Santa Ana winds through Thursday could bring gusts of 50 to 80 mph (128.7 kph) at times.", "description": "A spokeswoman for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library says it is being protected by firefighters as a wind-driven wildfire burns nearby in hills northwest of Los Angeles.
