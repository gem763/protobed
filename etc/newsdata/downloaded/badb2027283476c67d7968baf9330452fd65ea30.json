But according to the Daily Mail, SE has paid the transgender activist group $33,400 to counsel sports organizations to accept trans athletes with no restrictions.\n\nFor most sports, trans athletes are required to meet testosterone and physical requirements to be accepted as the gender they identify as, but Gendered Intelligence calls this a form of discrimination and is telling leagues to drop all requirements, according to documents that the newspaper reviewed.\n\nFor instance, one policy paper, entitled \u201cA Social Inclusion Model for Trans People in Sport,\u201d demands to know, \u201cWhy are we worrying about what medical intervention they may or may not have had? They are a woman, within women\u2019s parameters.\u201d\n\nGendered Intelligence (GI) is registered as a charity organization and claims to have performed trans-acceptance training to 16,000 people.\n\nGI denounces the \u201cexclusive\u201d policy of requiring trans athletes to provide medical evidence before competing. Instead, they are demanding that U.K. sports move to an \u201cinclusive\u201d model that \u201cassumes everyone can play unless there is a clear, objective reason for them to be excluded.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Sport England says it has not crafted its own official transgender policy, but it is promising to do so soon. The group released a statement saying, \u201cSport England is committed to ensuring that everyone can benefit from the benefits that leading an active life can offer. That\u2019s why we have been working with Gendered Intelligence since April to support the sector to be better equipped to include trans people.\u201d\n\nBut criticism of allowing biological men claiming to be trans women is growing, both in England and across the world.\n\nDr. Nicola Williams, who represents the women\u2019s rights group Fair Play For Women, said that by hiring GI, Sports England is \u201csneaking out\u201d a transgender policy by stealth even though it claims not to have an official trans policy.\n\nThe Mail also spoke to Cathy Devine, a specialist in sport policy for women, who said that Sports England might even be breaking British law.\n\n\u201cThe Equality Act says that people with the protected characteristic of \u2018gender reassignment\u2019 can be excluded from female sports categories for the purposes of fairness and safety,\u201d Divine told the paper.\n\nThe controversy comes on the heels of the mounting success of transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon, who has been trouncing natural-born female competitors in race after race.\n\nMcKinnon has been tearing through the female cycling world since competing as a transgender woman. McKinnon won the 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles in 2018, among other events.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @WTHuston.", "description": "The U.K. has devoted taxpayer dollars to a group that claims transgender women (biological males) should be allowed to compete against", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/R-6-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
