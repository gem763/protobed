(Jay Turnbull/CBC)\n\nAn employee of a gym in the strip mall told CBC News he saw the victim shortly before 8 a.m.\n\n\"I noticed the victim in his car because that's his usual routine \u2014 waiting in his car for me to come open up the gym,\" he said.\n\n\"I went upstairs to open the gym. When I got inside the gym, I heard two bangs. I thought it was construction because we are in a building that's under construction right now.\"\n\nA few minutes later, the gym employee noticed people were gathering outside so he went outside to investigate and saw the man with serious injuries to his head.\n\nNo suspects have been arrested.\n\nEarlier this month, Quebec provincial police arrested four people who were allegedly involved with homicides connected to organized crime.\n\nAt that time, S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec Chief Insp.
