And Elizabeth Warren is gaining traction among black female voters under 50, while Bernie Sanders has a significant following among young black voters as well.\n\nThe anecdotal reports from African-American activists on the ground offer a reason for skepticism that Biden has already clinched the Democratic Party\u2019s must-win voting bloc. The state of play is more fluid than assumed, they said, offering hope not just to Warren but to other candidates hoping to mount a late surge in the primary should Biden collapse.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
