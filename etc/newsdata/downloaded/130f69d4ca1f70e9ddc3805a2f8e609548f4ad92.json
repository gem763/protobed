We may want a war over, we may even declare it over. You can pull your troops out, as President Obama learned the hard way out of Iraq, but the enemy gets a vote, we say in the military. If we don\u2019t keep pressure on, then ISIS will resurge. It\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\" he explained.\n\nReports of ISIS fighters, who were being held in camps in northern Syria, have been able to escape as Turkey's military advances further into the country.\n\nMattis submitted his letter of resignation in December of 2018 after Trump announced at the time his intention to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria. The retired Marine Corps general also wrote how it is important to have allies and to treat them with respect.\n\nMy views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.\n\n\n\nBecause you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.\n\nWhile Mattis planned on leaving in February the following year, Trump replaced him with then-Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan at the beginning of 2019.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/13/2019 14:24:36PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/286/a9d085f7-b11c-40b8-adba-3e7345aea881.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
