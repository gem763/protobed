Humour is one of my favourite things and if we can use humour to raise awareness I\u2019m all for it.\n\n\u2018If one woman is inspired to check herself or get a mammogram from this video I will be happy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m doing it for a bigger cause. This is bigger than the video or me, this is about our mums, grandmothers, children, sisters and friends.\u2019\n\nFor Chris, it\u2019s not the first social experiment of this type to raise awareness for cancer. He and pal CJ Koegel created a similar viral clip in 2014 to raise money for prostate cancer.\n\nChris and Whitney\u2019s mum has had breast cancer twice but has now got the all-clear from her ten-year check-up.\n\nHere is more information on booking a breast cancer screening.\n\nMORE: One of UK\u2019s youngest terminal breast cancer patients has beautiful \u2018bucket list\u2019 wedding\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Is having itchy boobs a sign of breast cancer?\n\nMORE: Mum\u2019s breast cancer spotted by museum\u2019s thermal imaging camera\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Whitney Zelig, 29, from New York, wanted to remind women that they should also check their breasts out.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_92968629_1572192443.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
