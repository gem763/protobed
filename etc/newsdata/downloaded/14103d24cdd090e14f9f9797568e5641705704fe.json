The coordinated drone strikes on key Saudi oil facilities have removed nearly 5% of global supplies, an attack that the United States blamed Iran for.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the attack was a \u201cstate-on-state act of war\u201d by Iran, but the United States is still committed to find a diplomatic solution with Iran. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper added that the United States will send troops to Saudi Arabia but that would be \u201cdefensive in nature.\u201d U.S. treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said that \u201cthe United States will continue its maximum pressure campaign against Iran\u2019s repressive regime, which attempts to achieve its revolutionary agenda through regional aggression while squandering the country's oil proceeds.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the coordinated drone strikes affected the world\u2019s largest oil procession plant. In fact, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that almost 5.7 million barrels a day of and gas have been affected.\n\nMeanwhile, a positive trade deal between the United States and China would support crude since the trade dispute has impeded global economic expansion. Things are, in fact, looking up at the trade front. While U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office did say that trade talks with China were \u201cproductive\u201d over the weekend, China's Commerce Ministry added that the talks were \u201cconstructive.\u201d\n\nConcerns about economic recession were also weighing on crude prices for quite some time. But, higher factory output and strong consumer spending data have eased worries about an impending recession.\n\nThe Federal Reserve recently said that industrial production, a measure of factory, mining and utility output, increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.6% in August from the prior month. The reading was well above analysts\u2019 expectation of a 0.2% increase. At the same time, retail sales rose 0.4% last month, lifted by spending on motor vehicles, building materials, healthcare and hobbies.\n\nNonetheless, futures at one point of time increased 63 cents/b (0.98%) from Friday\u2019s closing price to $64.91/b. U.S. oil futures, by the way, moved 57 cents/b (0.98%) higher at $58.66/b.\n\nHow to Play Oil\u2019s Northward Journey\n\nIt\u2019s quite obvious, from bigwig oil producers to rig operators to pipeline owners; all are likely to witness a rally in their share prices as oil prices scale upward. Energy shares have been one of the poorest performers so far this year, however, now this continuous uptick in oil prices will surely lure investors back.\n\nIn fact, the recent rise in oil prices will improve margins of oilfield service contractors. Per Rystad Energy, the oilfield service industry was badly affected during the oil price collapse in 2014 and 2015. But now, as oil prices have continued to scale up, almost 60% the top 50 oilfield service contractors have said that their margins have improved. Oilfield service contractors have collectively registered an EBITDA margin of 15.2%in the first half of 2019, compared with 14.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nAs crude oil prices move north, prices of essential goods and commodities also increase. And value of gold rises when inflation picks up. After all, it acts as a hedge against inflation. In fact, theoretically, more than 60% of the time, gold and crude oil have a direct relationship. Thus, with oil prices moving north, shares of gold mining companies are poised to gain traction.\n\n5 Top Picks\n\nWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that can make the most of this bullish oil market.
