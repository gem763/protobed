Now I realize it hurt people and for that I\u2019m sorry.'\n\nShe also apologized for not knowing more about the conflict.\n\nThe Stone Cold singer wrote: 'Sorry I\u2019m not more educated, and sorry for thinking this trip was just a spiritual experience.\n\nTaking to social media: This came just a day after posting a gallery of images from the trip including one of her being 'baptized in the Jordan River'\n\n'Going against all advice right now and apologizing because it feels righ to me and I\u2019d rather get in trouble for being authentic to myself than staying quiet to please other people.'\n\nShe concluded the note by writing: 'I love my fans, all of them, from all over the world.'\n\nThis came just a day after posting a gallery of images from the trip including one of her being 'baptized in the Jordan River.'\n\n'There is something absolutely magical about Israel. I've never felt such a sense of spirituality or connection to God\u2026something I've been missing for a few years now,' the singer wrote in the caption of four photos taken during her experience that she shared on Instagram.\n\nPilgrimage: The Get Back singer also touched the Western Wall in the Old City Of Jersalem, which is considered the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray\n\nIn the first picture from her pilgrimage, Lovato is seen getting a hug moments after she was dipped into the holy waters, with a big smile of contentment on her face.\n\nShe's wearing a white baptismal robe that must be worn for all baptisms in the Jordan River.\n\nIt is a common practice for pilgrims to come from all over the world, like Lovato, and visit Israel to get baptized in the Jordan River.\n\n'I was raised Christian and have Jewish ancestors,' the Get Back singer wrote.\n\n'When I was offered an amazing opportunity to visit the places I'd read about in the Bible growing up, I said yes.'\n\nThe New Mexico native went on to talk about how important it was for her to be baptized in the same place Jesus Of Nazareth was baptized, adding that she's 'never felt more renewed in my life.'\n\nLovato also shared a few other photos of her in the Old City Of Jerusalem, including one where she touched the Western Wall. Made of ancient limestone, it has also been called the Wailing Wall due to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples.\n\nThe Western Wall is considered the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the holiest site in the Jewish faith lies behind it.\n\n'This trip has been so important for my well-being, my heart, and my soul,' Lovato concluded in the caption.\n\n'I'm grateful for the memories made and the opportunity to be able to fill the God-sized hole in my heart. Thank you for having me, Israel.'", "description": "Many on social media blasted the 26-year-old songstress - who suffered a near-fatal drug overdose in July of 2018 - for promoting the country amid the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "authors": ["Justin Enriquez", "Kevin Kayhart For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/09/19242190-0-image-a-5_1570089917314.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
