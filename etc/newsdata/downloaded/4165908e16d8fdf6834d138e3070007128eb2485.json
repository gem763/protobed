Is this the America you grew up believing in?'\n\nIt was said that no other forces had been near the site, which is close to the Turkish border, at the time.\n\nCaggins also said on Tuesday that Kurdish-led forces had 'set fire to, then vacated, its facilities and equipment' when 'Turkish-backed militias advanced towards the Lafarge Cement Factory'.\n\nA convoy of Turkish backed Free Syria Army troops as they cross into Turkey near the town of Azaz, Syria\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Turkey\n\nOn Sunday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper revealed the US planned to pull its remaining 1,000 troops out of northern Syria 'as safely and quickly as possible'.\n\nThere had been around 1,000 soldiers in the territory allied with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to combat ISIS. The Pentagon previously pulled about 30 of these troops from the Turkish attack zone along the border.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said: 'It'll be a deliberate withdrawal, and we want to conduct it as safely and quickly as possible.'\n\nEsper said he would not discuss a timeline for the US pullback, but said it would be done 'as safely and quickly as possible.'\n\nA military source confirmed on Wednesday that US forces had been pulled from all locations across Syria and would meet at a location near Kobani, from which they will be airlifted away from the conflict within the next few weeks.\n\nIt comes after Russian journalists filmed themselves inside abandoned American bases that appeared to have been left largely intact, with writing still seen on white boards inside.", "description": "Two jets were scrambled to blow up the storage bunker, located at the Lafarge Cement Factory between Koban\u00ee and Ain Issa, amid fears the weapons could fall into the hands of armed groups.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19843230-0-image-a-68_1571324277312.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
