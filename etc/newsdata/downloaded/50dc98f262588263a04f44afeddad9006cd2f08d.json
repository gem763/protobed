That leaves just 31% who say $1 million is not enough.\n\nBut it\u2019s that small group who\u2019s probably right, experts say. \u201cFor many people, $1 million isn't enough to live off in retirement,\u201d explains Mitchell C. Hockenbury, a certified financial planner at 1440 Financial Partners. \u201cWith people living longer with the advances of medical care and the higher costs of living, a million dollars just doesn't go as far as it used to.\u201d\n\n\n\nAiming for just $1 million by age 65 may be especially problematic for people in their 20s and 30s, says Mary Ellen Hancock, a senior wealth strategist at PNC Wealth Management \u2014 as inflation will lead to most things costing far more than they do now. And it may be hard for the majority of Americans who say they want to travel the world in retirement.\n\nHow can $1 million be too little? Let\u2019s say you subscribe to the commonly used 4% withdrawal rule, which means that you take 4% from your nest egg each year to pay your expenses, everything from food to insurance premiums to vacation costs. \u201cAt that rate, one would take $40,000 for the year. But, if this is inside of a 401(k) or traditional IRA, it hasn't been taxed. Once you pay for federal and state taxes (depending on your state) you may be left with $35,000,\u201d explains Hockenbury. \u201cFor a married couple with a car loan and the mortgage still not paid off, this can be a tremendous source of stress.\u201d\n\nNow add in a few other factors that can eat into your money. Kimberly Foss, president and founder of Empyrion Wealth Management, points to health care (even when you have Medicare coverage, which may exclude pricey things like some nursing home care). \u201cHaving a million dollars in the bank may seem like plenty of cushion, but when treatment for a single catastrophic illness or an extended nursing home stay can absorb funds in chunks of $250,000, that nest egg looks a little less secure,\u201d she says.\n\nOf course, you can likely factor in some Social Security income into what you can spend each month, and if you live in an inexpensive city and have low expenses you may be fine with just $1 million. Indeed, while $1 million might last more than 30 years in certain cities in Texas, in places like New York City, San Francisco and Honolulu, it might last only half that long, or less, according to data released Thursday from personal finance site SmartAsset, which analyzed data on average expenditures for seniors, cost of living and investment returns.\n\n\n\n10 cities where a $1 million nest egg lasts longest\n\nHarlingen, Texas 31.7 years McAllen, Texas 31.3 Memphis, Tenn. 29.8 Richmond, Ind. 29.8 Knoxville, Tenn. 28.9 Muskogee, Okla. 28.9 Kalamazoo, Mich. 28.6 Wichita Falls, Texas 28.6 Conway, Ark. 28.4 Jonesboro, Ark. 28.1\n\nSource: SmartAsset\n\n\n\nSo what is the magic number you need to save for retirement? It depends on the person, says Angela Coleman, a fiduciary investment adviser at Unified Trust \u2014 who says you can get a very rough estimate of how much you might need to save using a retirement calculator on a site like Bankrate.com.\n\nOf course, all of this likely sounds overwhelming to those of us who are just starting out. So here are five things you can do right now to start saving and to save more:\n\n. Start now. As soon as you can, start contributing to a retirement account like your company\u2019s 401(k). The younger you start, the longer your money has to grow.\n\nAs soon as you can, start contributing to a retirement account like your company\u2019s 401(k). The younger you start, the longer your money has to grow. . It\u2019s OK to start small , says Coleman. For example, if your employer offers at 401(k), contribute to it, even if it\u2019s just 1% of your salary.\n\n, says Coleman. For example, if your employer offers at 401(k), contribute to it, even if it\u2019s just 1% of your salary. . Gradually increase your contributions. Hancock says that you should try to up your contributions when you can every six months or so. So if you\u2019re putting in 2% of your salary to your 401(k) now, see how it might feel to put in 3% in six months. This, she says, will give you time to test the waters.\n\nHancock says that you should try to up your contributions when you can every six months or so.

Aim to save more than 10% of your income, experts say. You don\u2019t have to do this right away, but by slowly upping your contributions, you can get there.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "Plus, the No. 1 thing Americans get disastrously wrong about retirement", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP792_retire_MG_20190820123158.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-07"}
