Today, we turn our attention to chairs, because we all need more seating. You can get extremely cheap chairs and extremely expensive ones, but we set ourselves a limit of $150 (or thereabouts, making exceptions for a few that were too good to exclude). These are options for sprucing up a dining table, a bar counter, or a living room, because it\u2019s time to put those overworked Ikea chairs out of their misery.\n\nLiving room chairs\n\nFlash Furniture Beech Bentwood Chairs We think these would look cool as a pair around a similarly curved-shaped coffee table. Or, put one in your living room and tuck another in a corner of your dining room to create some symmetry throughout the house. $206 for 2 at Amazon Buy $206 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nHome TopGo Ball Chair It may not be the coziest to sit on, but this bright orange fiberglass stool-chair will definitely brighten up a room. $135 at Amazon Buy $135 at Amazon Buy\n\nArmen Living Summer Chair in Charcoal Fabric and Walnut Wood Finish $106 (was $237, now 55% off) This mid-century-style accent chair has undeniable Mad Men vibes. $106 at Amazon Buy $106 at Amazon Buy\n\nDuhome Design Dining Chair/Accent Chair with Metal Frame Legs and Velvet Seat, Rose This velvety, rose-colored scoop chair would be particularly elegant in the corner of a bedroom. (Bonus: the open back can serve as a deterrent from letting clothes pile up). $100 at Amazon Buy $100 at Amazon Buy\n\nArmchairs\n\nRoundhill Furniture Tuchico Contemporary Fabric Chair, Tan $111 (was $145, now 23% off) The seat is big and cushy, but the slim wooden legs and light-colored fabric let it blend in without feeling like it\u2019s taking up too much space. $111 at Amazon Buy $111 at Amazon Buy\n\nModern Design Fabric Chair w/Solid Wood Leg, Teal $90 (was $100, now 10% off) We\u2019re very into accent chairs in vibrant colors. This one has a bold shape, but it still looks like something you\u2019d actually want to sit in. $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nHomePop Velvet Swoop Arm Chair, Dark Green $154 (was $200, now 23% off) If you\u2019ve ever lived in an apartment with roommates, there\u2019s always that one super comfortable chair that\u2019s always been there and no one knows where it came from. This is like that chair, but brand-new. (Think Monica Geller\u2019s apartment aesthetic). $154 at Amazon Buy $154 at Amazon Buy\n\nDining room chairs\n\nSafavieh Home Bernice Natural Cane Dining Chair Adding some cane to your dining room will give the room some texture and warmth, not to mention that the material is having a moment. $180 at Amazon Buy $180 at Amazon Buy\n\nangelo:HOME Asti Collection Dining Chair Yes, these are also part of the mid-century trend, but the walnut wood and kind of geometric shape set them apart from more ubiquitous MCM styles. $130 for 2 at Amazon Buy $130 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nSandra Grey Fabric with Oak Finish Mid Century Modern Dining Chairs (Set of 2) A set of two Scandinavian-style dining chairs that look like they should cost double the list price. $120 for 2 at Amazon Buy $120 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nPoly and Bark Burton Side Chair in Clear (Set of 2) Clear plastic chairs (okay, ghost chair look-alikes): They match anything and are easy to clean. $127 at Amazon Buy $127 at Amazon Buy\n\nRivet Florence Mid-Century Wide Open-Back Accent Dining Chairs (Set of 2) These blue, open-backed chairs would work anywhere, and the black wooden legs are a little more subtle than the typical exposed woodgrain. $149 at Amazon Buy $149 at Amazon Buy\n\nEGGREE Mid Century Modern Accent Living Room Chairs (Set of 2), Velvet, Purple We love these velvet accent chairs. They could make for a stylish dining chair set if you\u2019re not worried about spilling food on the pastel purple fabric. $110 at Amazon Buy $110 at Amazon Buy\n\nStools\n\nROBTLE Anti-Slip Bentwood Stool If four stools sounds like too many, try one in a springy green (it also comes in Necco-wafer pink). $22 at Amazon Buy $22 at Amazon Buy\n\nVASAGLE Shoe Bench And if you\u2019re going to ask your guests to take their shoes off, at least let them do so in style on this very affordable mid-century-inspired bench. $56 at Amazon Buy $56 at Amazon Buy\n\nTopeakmart 17.3\u201d Tall Nesting Plastic Stack Stools Blue/Green/Red/White/Yellow (Set of 5, Multicolored) A set of five nesting stools in different colors. (Sure, they\u2019re a little kindergarten-y, but as long as you don\u2019t pair them with a sandbox and wooden blocks, you should be fine). $59 at Amazon Buy $59 at Amazon Buy\n\nEuro Style Sallie Modern Stool, White $45 (was $46, now 2% off) An abstract, hourglass-shaped stool that doubles as an end table. It\u2019s made from durable ABS plastic so it would work outside, too. $45 at Amazon Buy $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
