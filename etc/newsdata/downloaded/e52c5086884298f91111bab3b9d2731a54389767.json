He won the fight,\u201d said Warren. \u201cHe won it with a serious injury.\n\n\u201cI was concerned when the doctor went to the corner a couple of times he would stop the fight \u2013 maybe another doctor would have stopped it.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is Tyson won the fight. He did what he had to do, he hurt him a few times. Wallin was a very credible opponent.\n\n\u201cAll these people, armchair critics and judges, who come out with these various predictions for fights, I have to keep saying to them anything can happen with these big guys and it nearly did again.\u201d\n\nFury did not attend his post-match press conference as he was immediately whisked away for medical treatment and, while Warren is confident the damage will not affect the proposed February 22 rematch with Wilder, he admits it hinges on how well Fury heals.\n\n\u201cThe doctors here said as much as it was a very bad cut it was a clean cut and doesn\u2019t need micro-surgery inside and it will stitch well so, fingers crossed, it will be all right,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe said although it was deep they are not hard cuts to sew. He said they should heal pretty well.\u201d\n\nFury\u2019s trainer Ben Davison said, in the immediate aftermath, it was impossible to talk about the prospect of a delay on the Wilder bout.\n\n\u201cI know boxing very well but I couldn\u2019t comment on that. We will have to see what advice he gets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously it affected him a lot, he couldn\u2019t see out of it but he had to make out he could see out of it.\n\n\u201cBoxing is full of obstacles, sometimes you have to overcome these obstacles and that is what Tyson did. That is what champions have to do.\u201d\n\nDavison also brushed off criticism from Fury\u2019s father John, unable to travel to the USA because of previous convictions, who said his son looked \u201cweak as a kitten\u201d and the performance was \u201cthe worst I have seen from Tyson\u201d.\n\n\u201cJohn is Tyson\u2019s dad so you have to respect him but Tyson was fully prepared, you can\u2019t do nothing about a bad cut,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cJust because someone\u2019s gone the distance you can\u2019t say someone is weak. If someone is weak they wouldn\u2019t have done 12 rounds like that.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just keep saying it for the sake of it, he (Wallin) wasn\u2019t to be underestimated.\n\n\u201cThat is why we worked in training for it to potentially be a dogfight because we knew we might have to go there \u2013 although not in that manner.\n\n\u201cLuckily we had prepared Tyson for that, because that\u2019s what he needed.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Tyson Fury\u2019s reputation in the United States will not be affected by his gruelling 12-round victory over relative unknown Otto Wallin, according to the boxer\u2019s promoter Frank Warren.
