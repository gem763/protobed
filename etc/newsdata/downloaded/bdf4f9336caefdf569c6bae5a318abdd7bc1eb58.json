However, prices pared losses after U.S. President Donald Trump then said he had refused the request by Tehran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really been following headline to headline,\u201d said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n\nCrude futures were also earlier hit by a Wall Street Journal report citing unnamed sources saying that Saudi Arabia had agreed a partial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global Oil Forum.\n\nBrent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi facilities on Sept. 14, which initially halved the kingdom\u2019s production.\n\nSources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day.
