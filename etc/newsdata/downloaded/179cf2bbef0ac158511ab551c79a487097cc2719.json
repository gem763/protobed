(May 17) AP\n\nBrittany Snow says she doesn't regret opening up about her mental health \"too early\" during a time when honesty about personal struggles was ridiculed, not celebrated.\n\nThe \"Almost Family\" actress, 33, revealed her nine-year battle with anorexia, depression and self-harm in 2007. Much to Snow's surprise, her experience was slammed as a mere publicity stunt.\n\n\"I think there was still a stigma around sharing so much truth, and it kind of got seen as me being self-indulgent or trying to gain attention,\" she told InStyle. \"I definitely wasn't ready for that. I was too young and not prepared for what was going to happen.\"\n\nReview: Fox's 'Almost Family' is a drama disaster that makes light of a heinous crime\n\nSpeaking about mental health was a taboo over a decade ago, but times have certainly changed. Celebrities are now hailed for being candid about their trials and tribulations, including Selena Gomez and Justin Beiber, who both shared their personal struggles.\n\nSnow, however, didn't receive that kind of support from the world in 2007.\n\nIn fact, she called the response downright \"awful.\" The backlash forced her to step out of the limelight following an onset of crippling anxiety: \"I needed to, for health reasons.\"\n\nSelena Gomez: I'm 'healthier' after battling 'scariest moments of my life'\n\nJustin Bieber: Asks for fans' prayers after revealing he's been 'struggling a lot'\n\nBrittany Snow arrives at the 71st Emmy Awards at the Microsoft Theater.

Despite the initial critiscm, Snow said she's proud to have helped paved the way for others to open up about their internal battles without the fear of being shunned.\n\n\u201cI think that that's a really nice thing to feel like I was a part of, where I can tell my daughter one day, \u2018I was really honest when a lot of people weren't being honest,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIn my thirties, I can confidently say that it's almost like another life that I look back and [say], \u2018Wow, I was so anxious and scared, and now I'm just not.'\"\n\n'Talking about is the most important thing':Pink gets real about mental health, anxiety\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/18/brittany-snow-mental-health-admission-backlash/4029223002/", "description": "Brittany Snow doesn't regret opening up about her mental health \"too early\"  when honesty about personal struggles was ridiculed, not celebrated.", "authors": ["Cydney Henderson", "Published P.M.
