That's even though face-painted Iranian women have cheered for their team abroad for years despite the 1981 ban that followed the country's Islamic Revolution.\n\nAn Iranian woman shows off her country's flag during Thursday's match.

It's an extraordinary feeling,\" said Zahra Pashaei, a 29-year-old nurse who has only known soccer games from television. \"At least for me, 22 or 23 years of longing and regret lies behind this.\"\n\nIran scored in the game's fifth minute with a long shot by midfielder Ahmad Nourollahi. On Iran's conservatively controlled state television, which carried the match live, a shot of the cheering crowd included ecstatic women spectators. They followed with another goal in the 10th minute.\n\nIranian women cheer as they arrive at Azadi Stadium in Tehran on Thursday. (Vahid Salemi/Associated Press)\n\nWhile Iran for years has considered letting women into soccer matches, the decision to allow them in Thursday came as part of intense pressure from FIFA, the world body governing the sport. Iran faced a potential ban if it didn't allow women into the match.\n\nIran is the world's last nation to bar women from soccer matches. Saudi Arabia recently began allowing women into soccer matches.", "description": "Flag-draped Iranian women watched a FIFA soccer match from inside a Tehran stadium Thursday, the first time they've been freely allowed into a stadium in decades.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5316126.1570718964!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/iran-women-at-match.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
