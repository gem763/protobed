It is unclear if they, too, were coming down.\n\nIn addition to earning the ire of some on social media, the restaurant\u2019s owner may be facing charges for violating South Korea\u2019s National Security Act, which prohibits the display of \u201canti-government\u201d materials, the South China Morning Post reported. The country\u2019s National Security Law has been in place since 1948; those who violate may be punished with prison sentences of up to seven years.\n\nServing North Korean-style cuisine, however, is perfectly legal in South Korea. Many are currently in operation within Seoul, but, unlike the Pyongyang Pub, they don\u2019t brandish portraits of North Korean leaders.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nOpposition to the restaurant on Korean social media erupted over the weekend, with one user calling the management \u201cpathetic\u201d for \u201cfeaturing portraits of war criminals and dictators,\u201d per the South China Morning Post. Still, others who spoke with The Associated Press said they feel the establishment will survive the early setback.\n\n\"I think it is too early to do this kind of thing,\u201d one local said. \u201cBut once this place opens for business I would come here purely out of curiosity.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A restaurateur in South Korea has \u201cvoluntarily\u201d removed the images of North Korean leaders \u2014 along with a North Korea flag.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/SeoulNKThemedRestaurantAPPhotoLee-Jin-man2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
