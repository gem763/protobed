Beer writer, Karl Tessendorf delves into the new light beer movement that's sweeping the country. by: Karl Tessendorf | 18 Oct 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nLike it or not, light beer is here to stay. Personally, I\u2019ve never been a fan of anything light, be it food or drink because it usually sacrifices flavour and, after all, isn\u2019t that why we eat and drink nice things? Personal gripes aside, light beer (or lite beer, as it\u2019s often called) has morphed from just Castle Lite to emulate the American light beer boom, transforming into a gigantic market. Most of the big players now have a light variant and it was only a matter of time before craft beer went light.\n\nNew light lagers\n\nThis year alone we\u2019ve seen the launch of light lagers from Striped Horse, Noon Gun, Chester\u2019s Lager, Devil\u2019s Peak and Cape Brewing Company. These beers join Citizen, Darling Brew and Little Wolf to create a substantial light craft beer category. It\u2019s an understandable move from the brewers because we\u2019re a lager country and light lager is booming. Many craft purists will tell you that it flies in the face of everything that craft stands for. Hell, I\u2019d be inclined to agree with them, but in a struggling economy, it just makes good business sense to have a light line in the water.\n\nSo what makes a light beer light?\n\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is fewer calories and lower alcohol \u2013 this is achieved by adjusting the brewing process. By either extending the mashing process (steeping of malted barley) or adding an enzyme, most of the carbohydrates are broken down into sugars. The sugars are fermented by the yeast, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. Then the beer is diluted with water to get it to the correct alcohol percentage.\n\n\n\nThe spelling of \u2018lite\u2019 originated in America during the 70s, and the term stuck after Miller spent millions on advertising to push their lite beer. Light lagers typically have about 90 to 100 calories per bottle, while lagers normally push above 140 calories per bottle. One could argue that it\u2019s not a huge difference, but if you\u2019re trying to be better then every calorie counts. Light lagers also have very little body to them, which makes for a lighter drinking experience. This lighter experience is the reason given most often when someone explains why they drink light beer.\n\nSo where does this leave the South African craft beer market?\n\nWell, if you\u2019d told me a year ago that we\u2019d have a burgeoning category of light beers, I would\u2019ve laughed at you, but here we are. It irks the craft purist in me, but the sensible side of me says that the market needs to grow if it\u2019s going to survive. The light craft beers are good, but in a style where minimal flavour is expected, will consumers want to pay extra when we already have so many big beer alternatives?\n\nWith anything beer-related, the best way to form an educated opinion is to grab a bunch of mates and beers and drink them side by side in a blind tasting. A light lager tasting is one of the hardest because the flavours are so subtle, with nowhere to hide. I guarantee you\u2019ll be surprised by which beer you like best, because most of the time it\u2019s not the one you regularly drink.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in hearing how all the new light craft beers stack up against the big boys, check out the #BeerTime Podcast on Lite Lagers.\n\nCape Brewing Company\n\nStriped Horse\n\nNoon Gun\n\nDevil\u2019s Peak\n\nCitizen\n\nDarling:\n\nLittle Wolf\n\nALSO SEE...
