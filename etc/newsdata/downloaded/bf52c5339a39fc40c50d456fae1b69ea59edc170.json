(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 There will be a lot of Iran-related diplomatic action this week here in New York during the United Nations General Assembly, but any prospect of direct interaction between U.S. and Iranian officials is now officially eliminated, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Sunday. He also accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d and said he should be put on trial before the International Criminal Court.\n\nOnly a couple of weeks ago, it seemed quite possible that President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani might meet on the sidelines of the General Assembly to stop the escalation of tensions that has twice in a few months brought the two countries to the brink of armed conflict. Last month, Zarif flew to Paris and then Biarritz, France, on the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the hopes of negotiating a Trump-Rouhani meeting in New York.\n\nBut following the alleged Iranian attack on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure and new, even tougher U.S. sanctions against Iran\u2019s central bank, there\u2019s no possibility for a diplomatic exchange, much less a breakthrough, between Washington and Tehran, Zarif told a group of journalists Sunday afternoon at the Iranian U.N. mission.\n\n\u201cI think President Trump knowingly or unknowingly on Friday closed the door to negotiations,\u201d Zarif said.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration increased sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank in response to the attack on Saudi Arabia, designating the central bank as a supporter of terrorism, which eliminates any exceptions, even for humanitarian aid. Zarif blamed the sanctions on a Washington think tank, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), which the Iranian government has sanctioned as a supporter of terrorism.\n\n\u201cFDD, [its executive director] Mark Dubowitz, wanted to make sure neither this president nor his successor will be able to normalize relations with Iran,\u201d Zarif said.\n\nZarif denied Iran had anything to do with the attack. He said the Houthis developed and launched the advanced cruise missiles and drone swarms on their own. On Sunday, Pompeo on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d called it \u201ccrazy\u201d for anyone to claim the Houthis perpetrated the attack and he called Zarif a liar with no real influence over Iranian foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe hope the Iranian people, who we think are demanding that their country stop this kind of behavior, act in a way that causes the Iranian regime's behavior to change. That's our mission sense,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nZarif responded Sunday that Pompeo was admitting to starving the Iranian people for political objectives.\n\n\u201cAt least Secretary Pompeo is brave enough to admit that they are conducting economic terrorism,\u201d said Zarif. \u201cI think he should be prepared to answer the consequences in [the] International Criminal Court. \u2026 Get a good lawyer.\u201d\n\nZarif will meet leaders of the other countries that are a party to the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday morning and try to convince them to ease economic restrictions on Iran. Macron is proposing extending Iran a $15 billion line of credit in exchange for Iran coming back to the table and adhering to its commitments under the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nTrump reportedly considered endorsing the French proposal, but Zarif said the Europeans should just defy the United States and make a deal without a \u201cgreen light\u201d from Trump. Money would have to begin flowing before Iran would sit down for negotiations over the nuclear issue, even with the Europeans, he said.\n\n\u201cThe credit that they are talking about is not charity. \u2026 The credit is in lieu of the oil they were supposed to buy,\u201d Zarif said.\n\nRouhani will come to New York on Wednesday and announce his proposal for a new \u201cCoalition for Hope,\u201d which Zarif said was open to membership to anyone who wanted to join. Details regarding the coalition were scarce.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with the assembled U.S. journalists that lasted more than an hour, Zarif made several dubious assertions, including that Iran does not run proxy operations in other countries and that no Iranian forces (or their proxies) are involved in current military operations in the Idlib region of Syria.\n\nHe admitted an Iranian oil tanker had unloaded its cargo near Syria, but claimed it unloaded in international waters so Iran was not responsible for its final destination. Zarif declined to say whether Iran was currently exporting oil to China, because he said he didn\u2019t want to expose China to U.S. punishment.\n\n\u201cWe have an energy relationship with China, but we are not going to be transparent, period,\u201d he said.\n\nZarif did say his government was discussing with China a 25-year economic partnership that could result in more than $400 billion of Chinese investment in Iran. But Zarif repeatedly refused to acknowledge, much less criticize, the Chinese government\u2019s internment of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the Western interference in other countries\u2019 internal affairs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think countries need to be able to respect the rights of their populations based on the values of those countries.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFareed Zakaria: The central mistake of Trump\u2019s Iran policy\n\nMax Boot: In his showdown with Iran, Trump blinks\n\nJosh Rogin: How Trump can punish Iran, without starting a war\n\nJason Rezaian: Bolton\u2019s departure will fundamentally alter Trump\u2019s Iran policy\n\nKenneth M.
