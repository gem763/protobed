He received a bone marrow transplant from his brother in December, and was already on the road to recovery.\n\nIn May, Balla received the upsetting news that his cancer was back. But, after more chemotherapy treatments, he went back into remission.\n\nNow cancer-free, Balla is using his story to encourage more men to stop ignoring what they might think are minor health concerns.\n\n\u201cI have learned that you have to kind of follow up and make sure that you're listening to your body,\" he said, according to FOX8.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDoctor Aaron Gerds, an oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said he sees more and more men ignoring warning signs and attributing them simply to skin problems.\n\n\u201cIt's called acute because if people don't get treatment right away, it can take people's lives within days and weeks,\u201d he said.", "description": "The decision by an Ohio man to go to the emergency room to have a second look at a bug bite turned out to be a life-saving one, doctors say.", "authors": ["Paulina Dedaj", "Paulina Dedaj Is A Writer", "Reporter For Fox News.
