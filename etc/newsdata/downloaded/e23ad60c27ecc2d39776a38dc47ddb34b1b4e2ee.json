(Jim Bourg/Reuters)\n\nA Saudi manufacturing tycoon sent hundreds of thousands of dollars through his business associate to help pay for President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection inauguration.\n\nSheikh Mohammed Al Rahbani attempted to send $850,000 through his associate Imaad Zuberi, the Associated Press reported. However, Zuberi, a straw donor who has donated to multiple U.S. political campaigns including almost $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, actually only donated $97,500 of that money and pocketed the rest for himself.\n\nRahbani\u2019s donation is illegal under U.S. law.\n\nZuberi, a venture capitalist, has fundraised millions of dollars for both Republicans and Democrats, including Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns as well as lawmakers who figure prominently in deciding U.S. foreign policy, such as Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel.\n\nHe has been charged and pled guilty as part of an agreement with prosecutors that he appropriated the majority of the donation to the Obama inaugural committee.\n\nRahbani has not been charged and has declined to comment on the matter.\n\nTrump\u2019s inaugural committee has not been charged in connection with the case and said it has cooperated with the federal investigation.", "description": "A Saudi manufacturing tycoon sent hundreds of thousands of dollars through his business associate to help pay for President Barack Obama's reelection inauguration.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
