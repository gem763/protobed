Owing to the \u201cweaponization\u201d of Title IX, we now a sprawling bureaucracy of leftist ideologues who are eager to use their power to punish those who say politically incorrect things that have even the most tenuous relationship to sexual harassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn today\u2019s Martin Center article, Professor Adam Ellwanger explains how bad things are. Speaking from personal experience, he relates that when a student, upset at the grade he\u2019d received, filed a Title IX complaint against him that did not contain a \u201clegitimate\u201d allegation, school officials coached him on how to change it so that it was.\n\nEllwanger was able to fight the complaint off (after months of bureaucratic heel dragging in which he was not informed of the exact nature of the complaint) only because, he argues, he holds tenure. That\u2019s an important protection for the remaining conservatives in academe.\n\nHe doubts that the Trump Education Department is up to the task of defeating the monster that Title IX has become. He\u2019s probably right, since that requires the repeal of the law to eliminate the power all those aggressive campus bureaucrats have. That simply isn\u2019t possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEllwanger rightly concludes, \u201cTitle IX in its expanded articulation is nothing less than an attempt to advance the ideological objectives of the left on campus. It has been weaponized to silence dissenting speech and chill open debate of leftist ideology on campus. If the university is to remain a place for open inquiry and the production of new knowledge, dissenting voices (often conservative ones) need more than due process in the procedure of investigating complaints against them.\u201d", "description": "It's harmful to professors and students.", "authors": ["George Leef", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
