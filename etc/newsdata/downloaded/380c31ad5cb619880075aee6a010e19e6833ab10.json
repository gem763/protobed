(Cole Davis)\n\nPhotographer Cole Davis was born in Texas, grew up in Louisiana and now lives in Brownsville, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, where he says, \u201cI\u2019m a photographer photographing life underneath the headlines.\u201d\n\nDavis moved to Brownsville after hearing of the tragic death of a teenager named Timi Oyebola.\n\nHe notes Brownsville is often referred to as the \u201cMurder Capital of New York,\u201d but he says, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a shooting to make people pay attention to Brownsville, but since they\u2019re paying attention, there\u2019s an opportunity to show what it\u2019s like to live in the neighborhood, show that it\u2019s not only a dangerous neighborhood that pops up in crime articles, but also a place of beauty and depth.\u201d\n\nIn Sight asked Davis to talk a little bit more about the work he is doing there. Here\u2019s what he said.\n\n\u201cOn Sept. 20, 2018, Minister David Oyebola sat with his son Timi telling him stories from his travels. Timi was distant, hardly listening. \u2018He knew he was leaving,\u2019 his father recalled. The next day, on a Brownsville basketball court, a bullet struck the 16-year-old in the forehead, and the kind-spirited teen and community mentor was killed. Afterward, his father demanded merciless justice for his son\u2019s murderer \u2014 only to discover weeks later that the killer was 14 years old.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t understand the impalpable horror of this tragedy. I researched tirelessly following the event, I learned about Brownsville\u2019s reputation, the associations that people attach to its name: the \u2018Murder Capital of New York.\u2019 Sixty thousand people living in one square mile, with the highest incarceration rate of any New York area by a significant margin. But despite so many heavy statistics, I found beauty and aliveness walking around, more so than suffering. My skin became stitched to the skin of the community, and I didn\u2019t know how to stop, I didn\u2019t know how to leave. So I moved in. I was conscious of my identity as a white man from Louisiana in a predominantly black neighborhood. It was often an uncomfortable experience, being the only one who looked different. Before this, my understanding of race was shallow, as it no doubt still is, but I began to comprehend what \u2018minority\u2019 fundamentally means.\n\n\u201cI was walking in East New York, a few months after feeling at home in Brownsville, when I bumped into the church where Timi\u2019s father was a minister. He sat down and told me the whole story in detail. I spent a lot of time thinking about what happened to Timi \u2014 and here I was with someone who had no choice whether or not to think about it. Speaking to him, I realized his focus was entirely on the protection and prosperity of the next generation of children. Not on the past. And in this, there is no longer fear, only solutions.\n\n\u201cI still live in Brownsville, because of a simple notion: I love being there. It\u2019s an area of authenticity. I often questioned myself, or was questioned by others \u2014 about the risk of exploiting a black neighborhood as a white photographer, facing the backlash and criticism for it, but the risk is worth it. Because if there is a one-in-a-million chance to help, to grow, to share, it\u2019s worth it. Even if none of these things happen, I\u2019d rather get torn apart having tried, then not try at all. Nothing gives me the right to enter the discourse on race, nor anyone; it isn\u2019t a right, but a decision, to throw our hat in the ring and face the possible consequences for caring.\u201d\n\nYou can see more of Davis\u2019s work on his website, here.\n\n\n\nAn anti-violence sign posted in the Chester Street basketball court, the court where Timi Oyebola died.
