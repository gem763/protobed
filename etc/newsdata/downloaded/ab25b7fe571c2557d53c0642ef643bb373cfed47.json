From the Washington Post Sunday morning:\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48\n\nThe Post has since rewritten that, though the description of an \u201caustere religious scholar with wire-rimmed glasses\u201d remains in the lead paragraph. Meanwhile, the headline on Foxnews.com:\n\nAl-Baghdadi kill: how the daring military operation went down\n\nThe Post headline would fit a quiet academic who died in his sleep, not a genocidal jihadist leader. The Fox headline is less nuts, but still not quite right: al-Baghdadi wasn\u2019t killed but reportedly committed suicide, while pursued by American \u201cmilitary dogs.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump was correct when he tweeted Saturday night that something \u201cbig\u201d had happened, but from there, America received two almost completely different versions of the story of al-Baghdadi\u2019s pursuit and suicide. It was a vivid demonstration of how dysfunctional the modern news landscape has become.\n\nWhen important events take place now, commercial news outlets instantly slice up the facts and commoditize them for consumption by their respective political demographics. We always had this process, to some degree, but it no longer takes days to sift into the op-ed pages.\n\nNow news is packaged for Republicans or Democrats on the first reporting pass. Moreover, it\u2019s no longer true that Fox is more blatant about its slant than the Democrat-friendly press, which in the Trump years has become a bullhorn of caricatured bellyaching in the same way Fox was in the Clinton years.\n\nThe Trump version of the Baghdadi story was a predictable heroic cartoon. The Obama administration at least had the decency to seek out a decent director and wait a year or so before the heroic Zero Dark Thirty bin-Laden-killing epic was released. Trump decided the skip the Hollywood negotiations and deliver the boffo movie lines upfront.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d Trump said, saying al-Baghdadi died \u201cwhimpering and crying.\u201d Al-Baghdadi, Trump said, was the \u201cbiggest ever\u201d terror villain, even bigger than bin Laden, because he \u201cbuilt a caliphate.\u201d He even praised the \u201cbeautiful dog, talented dog\u201d that chased al-Baghdadi into a tunnel. The White House released photos of Trump and advisers watching the assault, an experience Trump described as being like \u201cyou were watching a movie.\u201d\n\nConservative media immediately emphasized the political benefit of the raid to Trump, as in the Fox headline, \u201cAl-Baghdadi takedown catches Dems flat-footed, blunts criticism of Trump\u2019s Syria pullback.\u201d There was also mockery of liberal culture-war targets like Saturday Night Live, which ran an ill-timed gag this weekend. \u201cSNL mocks Trump for \u2018bringing jobs back to ISIS\u2019 amid operation targeting Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria,\u201d read the Foxnews.com headline.\n\nMeanwhile, in what increasingly feels like a monolithic bloc of anti-Trump media at the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, etc., the Baghdadi headlines were a remarkable collection of angst-ridden talking points. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who can ever celebrate a violent helicopter assault that results in the deaths of children \u2013 I count myself in that number \u2013 the difference in how this story was covered compared to analogous stories about bin Laden or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was striking. Apparently, the salient facts about the death of al-Baghdadi included:\n\nThat last story \u2013 that Trump\u2019s situation room photo was taken nearly two hours after the raid happened, undercutting the notion that Trump was \u201cwatching a movie\u201d \u2013 flew around the Internet for hours before it turned out to have been based on an error. Actual news outlets noted the presence of unplugged Ethernet cables, like moon landing conspiracists pointing out suspicious shadows. It should be noted that similar absurdities directed toward Obama rocketed around the Internet after the bin Laden news broke.\n\nAppropriately, many Americans used to roll their eyes at the brazen pettiness of Fox news. During the Obama years, the network seemed constitutionally incapable of reporting positive news of any kind, or even dealing with anodyne developments rationally. \u201cThis is proof he\u2019s a Marxist,\u201d was a famed Fox line about Obama\u2019s decision to wear a tan suit.\n\nTrump is inspiring similar insanity now with Fox\u2019s opposites at the Times, Post, CNN, MSNBC, etc. I\u2019m no fan of Trump either, but this has gotten to the point where there\u2019s no longer anyplace to go, if you\u2019re looking for unslanted first-draft takes on news. I\u2019m increasingly forced to turn to the BBC and AFP to try to grab raw quotes and numbers before spin doctors in American outlets have a chance to salt news with hot takes.\n\nDuring the Trump-Clinton presidential race three years ago, I wrote:\n\nThe model going forward will likely involve Republican media covering Democratic corruption and Democratic media covering Republican corruption. This setup just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe al-Baghdadi story is a classic example of what happens when that dynamic is allowed to play out to its logical conclusion. From Fox to the New York Times, all of the major commercial outlets this weekend were more consumed with telling audiences who benefited politically from the al-Baghdadi mission, than getting the facts about that mission out.\n\nThis is a disservice to audiences, who deserve to know the basics. Who is al-Baghdadi? How did he come to be the leader of ISIS/ISIL? Why was he in Idlib? The story of this person ought to have been a mix of the enraging and the sobering. Al-Baghdadi was reportedly involved in all sorts of atrocities, from beheadings to crucifixions, but he seems to have become radicalized by America\u2019s invasion of Iraq.\n\nThis ought to have been a moment to reflect on what\u2019s happened in the last twenty years, and if our policies across multiple administrations have been the right ones. Would we even be launching operations against such a person if we hadn\u2019t invaded Iraq all those years ago? What\u2019s the endgame? What do the people of the region think?\n\nAll of this has been subsumed to the only story left that matters in the United States \u2013 who\u2019s winning Twitter at any given moment, Trumpers or anti-Trumpers? News outlets are now so committed to pushing one or the other narrative that they are falling prey to absurdities like the Post\u2019s \u201caustere cleric\u201d headline.\n\nIf papers are going to go this far in an obituary to avoid even the implication of a favorable Trump narrative, how are audiences supposed to trust reporting on super-charged partisan stories like impeachment? There\u2019s more to life, and to the news, than what is or isn\u2019t good for Donald Trump. Can\u2019t we at least get a day or two of facts before we fight over whom they favor?", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Matt Taibbi", "Contributing Editor", "Matt Taibbi'S Most Recent Stories", "Baghdadi Story Reveals Divided", "Broken", "News Media", "Everyone Is A Russian Asset", "In Democratic Debate", "More Evidence That Ukrainegate Helps Biden", "View All"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_editorial_10457627b-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
