U.K. House Prices Barely Grow in Subdued Market, Nationwide Says\n\n(Bloomberg) -- U.K. home-price inflation slowed last month to the lowest since January as Brexit uncertainty made buyers and sellers more cautious, according to Nationwide Building Society.\n\nPrices rose 0.2% in September from a year ago, the 10th month of gains below 1%, the mortgage lender said Tuesday. That was down from 0.6% in August. On the month, values slipped 0.2%.\n\nThe U.K. housing market has little more than stagnant this year as the country approaches its departure from the European Union. Originally scheduled for March, the new Oct. 31 deadline may be extended again if Prime Minister Boris Johnson is bound by legislation to seek more time if he doesn\u2019t get a deal by middle of the month.\n\n\u201cHouse-price growth almost ground to a halt,\u201d said Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. That reflects a cooler economy, which \u201cappears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty.\u201d\n\nFigures on Monday showed mortgage approvals fell in August. They\u2019ve been stuck in a narrow range around 65,000 a month this year.\n\nLondon was the worst performing region in the third quarter, according to the report. The strongest gains were seen in Northern Ireland.", "description": "U.K. House Prices Barely Grow in Subdued Market, Nationwide Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECB7000_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
