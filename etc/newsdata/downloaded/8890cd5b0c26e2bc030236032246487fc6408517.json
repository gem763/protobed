Truly we live in an era of delayed woke | Barbara Ellen", "language": "en", "text": "Musician Pharrell Williams says he is now \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Blurred Lines, his controversial hit with Robin Thicke. He says that he has only belatedly realised that such sentiments as \u201cI know you want it\u201d and guest rapper TI\u2019s lyric: \u201cI\u2019ll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two\u201d could be considered \u201crapey\u201d. Now Williams says: \u201cSome of my old songs, I would never write or sing today. I get embarrassed\u2026 It just took a lot of time and growth to get there.\u201d Williams adds: \u201cI realised that we live in a chauvinist culture\u2026 Didn\u2019t realise that [some] of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it, folks \u2013 behold the pop-cultural phenomenon of Delayed Woke. The generally male, conveniently belated mea culpa of sexism, which seems to say that you can behave as you like as long as you\u2019re very apologetic at some unspecified point in the future.\n\nNo one is claiming that Blurred Lines was the first ever sexist song. Nor is it only Williams who is guilty of delayed wokery. Snoop Dogg said that he didn\u2019t regret initially blasting women as \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cwhores\u201d, as he later grew to respect women, going on to view his early material as merely a marker for how far from misogyny he had come (so glad that womankind could help with your \u201cjourney\u201d, Snoop!).\n\nElsewhere, after the comedian Louis CK was pilloried for masturbating in front of women, he \u201capologised\u201d (ish) by incorporating his infamy into his act, perhaps proving that, for some, woke ends up permanently delayed.\n\nBlurred Lines wasn't 'different' times. All this happened, not in yon olden pop days, but in 2013\n\nThen there are Beastie Boys, who were slammed for misogyny around their first album, Licensed to Ill (women dancing on stage in cages and the like). However, not only were the Beasties very young, they listened to criticism, later apologising in a song (Sure Shot), and renouncing chauvinism. By contrast, Williams was already 40 when Blurred Lines was released. But hey, I suppose some artists need more \u201ctime and growth\u201d than others.\n\nAm I being too harsh on Williams? Possibly. At least he\u2019s no longer defending Blurred Lines with such zingers as: \u201cIs it sexually suggestive when a car salesman says to a person who is trying to buy a car, \u2018I know you want it\u2019?\u201d (Yup, an actual quote from 2014.) However, this former music hack knows that releasing a pop song is a fairly lengthy process, with plenty of time for a seasoned professional to reflect that things had become \u201crapey\u201d.\n\nIn short, I don\u2019t entirely buy this \u201challelujah \u2013 I\u2019ve seen the chauvinist light!\u201d routine that adult men belatedly come out with \u2013 after, say, they have banked all the global royalties and noted not only the #MeToo storm but also how admired artists such as John Legend are for their pro-feminist mindsets.\n\nLet\u2019s face it, Blurred Lines wasn\u2019t \u201cdifferent times\u201d. All this happened, not in yon olden pop days, but in 2013. It\u2019s sweet that Williams finally, as he says, \u201cgot it\u201d. Then again, Pharrell, what took you so long?\n\nWriting a motto for anorexics is hardly holistic, Gwyneth\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gwyneth Paltrow: \u2018quackery\u2019. Photograph: Amy Sussman/FilmMagic\n\nWe have become accustomed to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s wellness-quackery, via her Goop site. Many will recall her advice to steam your vagina \u2013 only expensively, mind, ladies; it wouldn\u2019t be holistic just to throw your knickers off and crouch over a scalding, billowing kettle spout, DIY-style. However, groundbreaking as Paltrow has been over the years, she and Goop need to be careful that they don\u2019t cross the line and become dangerous.\n\nGoop recently published a Q&A about achieving one\u2019s \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d, angering and dismaying those who try to help people with eating disorders. In fairness, the person being interviewed, Traci Mann, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota, is against strict dieting and her argument directly relates to an individual\u2019s \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d \u2013 without extreme steps.\n\nHowever, people with eating disorders wouldn\u2019t look at it like that. For them, \u201cleanest liveable weight\u201d is likely to be misappropriated as an aspirational buzzphrase, similar to the infamous 2009 Kate Moss quote: \u201cNothing tastes as good as skinny feels.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of thing that ends up on those ghastly Pro-Ana/Thinspiration sites. Anorexia is a potentially fatal mental health disorder and Goop has unwittingly pandered to it.\n\nAnorexics don\u2019t tend to tell each other: \u201cHey, let\u2019s all get so emaciated that we collapse and die.\u201d They say: \u201cHere\u2019s how to eat as little as possible, but still function.\u201d\n\nThey tell each other lies, because they\u2019re lying to themselves. And they\u2019ll use whatever the beautiful Paltrow advocates to justify it. Goop is often good for a giggle, but there\u2019s a big difference between risible lifestyle blather and irresponsibility.\n\nWe all ooh and aah, but isn\u2019t everyone sick of fireworks now?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bonfire Night festivities in Lewes: \u2018fireworks are an exploding anachronism\u2019. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nBravo to Sainsbury\u2019s for stopping selling fireworks, joining the Co-op, which stopped in 2014. Britons spend \u00a320m a year on fireworks, but does anyone genuinely like them?\n\nI\u2019ve always disliked fireworks. They terrify animals. Idiots use them as weapons. They\u2019re pollutants. Even when they\u2019re used \u201ccorrectly\u201d they\u2019re boring. Colours in the sky, whizzy sounds, loud bangs \u2013 is this really supposed to be entertaining? You guys are easily pleased. I used to stub out cigarettes with more drama.\n\nFirework displays seem to continue for no other reason than that they\u2019re traditional. The rationale appears to be that all big events, not just Bonfire Night, need marking with pointless firework displays. Cue crowds of people staring at the sky, insincerely muttering: \u201cGosh, what a spectacle, I\u2019m changed forever\u201d, after which everyone trails away, cold, unsatisfied and with cricked necks.\n\nThere\u2019s a community spirit argument at this time of year, and I\u2019d hate to be a bonfire grinch, so instead of fireworks why not have open-air film screenings or silent discos? There\u2019s no reason why people need to stifle yawns, staring mindlessly at outmoded pyrotechnics. I\u2019ve twirled a few sparklers in my time, but generally fireworks are an exploding anachronism.\n\n\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist", "description": "The pop star has seen the light about his \u2018rapey\u2019 lyrics.
