Missile strikes on Saudi Arabian refineries, and global warming ... everywhere.\n\nInvestors have had no lack of things to worry about in the global economy lately -- and that's probably a big part of the reason the S&P 500 is down 2% since this month began. Lately, investor worries have found a new center of focus in China, where trade negotiations between the U.S. and that country have taken a(nother) turn for the worse.\n\nNot only are new 30% US tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods about to kick into effect on October 15. This week, the US Commerce Department announced a new blacklisting of 28 Chinese companies and organizations over allegations of Uighur persecution, putting new trade talks at risk.\n\nWhere is an investor to turn for safety in a world like this? Asking the TipRanks Stock Screener for some answers, we find many Wall Street analysts think you're best off sticking with \"the usual suspects.\" No matter how bad things get for the world at large, Deutsche Bank analysts, in particular, still think that strong buy-rated tech giants Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook each of which reports earnings this month -- will come out on top in the end. Let's take a closer look:\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nThe first of these tech giants to report will be Amazon, with Q3 earnings expected to arrive just two weeks from now, on October 24. That sounds like good news, but investors may need to be careful about this one.\n\nOn the one hand, analysts who track Amazon's fortunes are optimistic about revenues, predicting that Amazon's sales will surge more than 21% year over year to tip the scales at $68.8 billion. On the other hand, though, profits could come as a bit of a shock. The consensus estimate right now is that Amazon will earn only $4.57 per share for the quarter -- more than a 20% drop from last year's Q3.\n\nDespite this prospect, 5-star Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley issued a bullish report on Amazon, reiterating the bank's \"buy\" rating on the shares and predicting the shares will top $2,450 a year from now -- 42% more than they sell for today. (To watch Walmsley's track record, click here)\n\nWhat makes Walmsley so optimistic? \"We ... think AWS related sales and marketing investment in 1H should pay dividends helping stabilize AWS growth in 2H,\" argues the analyst, referring to Amazon Web Services, the source of only 11% of Amazon's revenue ... but 59% of its profits. Although some investors are worried about the higher costs Amazon plans to incur in offering 1-day shipping service to its retail customers, Walmsley thinks a small sacrifice of \"near term margins\" in the service of winning faster sales growth through \"1-day prime\" is a trade-off worth making.\n\nAll in all, the retail giant looks like a very compelling investing opportunity, as TipRanks analytics showcasing AMZN as a \"strong buy.\" With an average price target of $2,293.72, analysts are predicting an upside potential of 33% for the stock. In total, Amazon stock has received 33 \"buy\" ratings vs. just one \"hold\" rating in the past three months.
