Jackie Doyle-Price, the minister for mental health and suicide prevention, said anyone thinking of a breast enlargement or lip fillers must check that the practitioner is qualified. She disclosed figures showing that at least one NHS hospital has seen a six-fold rise in corrective procedures following cut-price cosmetic surgery abroad. Contestants such as Love Island\u2019s Megan Barton-Hanson have spoken openly about undergoing such surgery. But Miss Doyle-Price said: \u2018Love Island sits atop lots of things which put across a generally unrealistic picture of body image. \u2018We also see it in The Only Way Is Essex and Absolutely Ascot \u2013 everyone is having lip fillers and boob jobs. \u2018If people want to change aspects of their appearance that is fine, but they need to understand that all these procedures come with risk.\u2019 She said one study at the Royal London Hospital last year found a six-fold rise in cases needing follow-up care from procedures done abroad since 2013. The hospital spent more than \u00a363,000 to repair botched overseas surgery. The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London had to treat 12 patients with infected fillers in the past year at a cost of \u00a340,000. Miss Doyle-Price warned against going to places such as Turkey, India and eastern Europe for inexpensive operations. \u2018Please don\u2019t do it because the NHS is having to put problems right,\u2019 she said.\n\nPatients at these clinics were also not being given enough 'cooling off' time after their consultation to properly consider the procedures.\n\nOther common areas of concern included an inability to manage anaphylaxis \u2013 a deadly allergic reaction \u2013 and a lack of attention to fundamental safety processes.\n\nThe CQC said it also had concerns about equipment cleanliness and maintenance at some clinics.\n\nIt has so far inspected 65 of the 102 services it licenses in England to carry out cosmetic surgery and published reports on 58 of them.\n\nThe watchdog has taken enforcement action against 12 of those 58 \u2013 a fifth of the total. This means the surgeries must make fundamental changes to their practices or risk being closed.\n\nIn August, the regulator suspended the Look Younger clinic in Chichester in west Sussex from operating after uncovering an array of safety issues.\n\nThe establishment was found to be putting patients at risk by not doing enough to control the risk of infection.\n\nIt was also using out-of-date medicine and had too few trained staff to keep patients safe.\n\nThe CQC also stripped Bearwood cosmetic clinic in Solihull, West Midlands, of its licence after unearthing a number of unsafe practices.\n\nDetails around what poor standards inspectors found will be released when a new report is 'published soon', the watchdog said.\n\nProfessor Ted Baker, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, has since written to all the beauty clinics and warned them they face being shut down if standards are not improved.\n\nIn the letter, he says: 'Where we have concerns about the quality and safety of services, we will use our enforcement powers to demand improvements and, in the case of very significant concerns, to suspend or cancel a provider's registration in order to protect people receiving care.'\n\nThe Royal College of Surgeons of England said the CQC\u2019s findings showed that some clinics were not meeting its own professional standards for cosmetic surgery.", "description": "The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said 20 per cent of clinics in England put clients at risk of serious harm.
