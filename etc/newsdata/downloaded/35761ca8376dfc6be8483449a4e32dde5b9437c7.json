Till a few days ago, the perception built was that BJP would win more than 70 seats in the state and that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had managed to consolidate the non-Jat vote while the dominant Jat community was split in its loyalty towards INLD (OP Chautala) and Congress (Bhupinder Hooda). So, what changed within the last few days or were the signs always there and experts failed to read them?\n\nThe popular perception was that INLD, Congress and Dushyant Chautala\u2019s JJP were all fighting for the Jat votes that constitute 20-25% of the state\u2019s electorate. While a majority of the remaining vote was left for BJP to walk away with the prize for the second successive time. On can hardly blame BJP for covertly pushing Dushyant Chautala\u2019s fledgling JJP to cut into Jat votes of INLD and Congress. The new party had always eaten into the vote share of Congress in the previous by-elections held in the state. But JJP seems to have made a serious dent into BJP\u2019s vote on some seats this time.\n\nThe striking feature of this election is the Jat community that voted strategically for stronger candidates of Congress and JJP on selective seats with the sole aim of defeating BJP. Congress and JJP have also wrested many reserved seats which BJP held in 2014. This also points to the urban-rural divide where the anger of rural youth coupled with unemployment seemed to have spelt trouble for BJP. The rate of unemployment in Haryana is nearly three times more than the national average as per CMIE.\n\nBJP may have Narendra Modi as its trump card who also happens to be the most popular leader in the country. But the electorate seem to make the differentiation between a national election and state elections where they know Modi will not be their chief ministerial candidate.", "description": "It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that BJP is struggling to win 40 seats in Haryana, a state where they swept to power five years ago winning 47 out of 90 assembly seats.
