Howe", "language": "en", "text": "Canada\u2019s strong financial services sector is an \u201cunderwhelming\u201d contributor to the country\u2019s productivity, according to a report from the C.D. Howe Institute, which places some of the blame on what it views as restrictive rules that hold back competition and innovation.\n\nThe report, written by policy analyst Farah Omran and Jeremy Kronick, associate director of research at the think tank, suggests Canada\u2019s lagging productivity could be given an \u201coutsized\u201d boost from the financial services sector if rules were updated to encourage more competition from non-traditional, innovative financial technology (fintech) services.\n\nIt also recommends changing the incentive structure of financial institutions to shift the focus from government-backstopped mortgage lending to making loans to small and medium-sized businesses \u2014 which would also benefit from increased competition in the lending segment of capital markets.\n\nAccording to the authors, it has been established by earlier research that \u201crobust\u201d productivity growth occurs when regulations and policies foster competition and spur innovation in the delivery of financial services, and create conditions to attract and efficiently allocate capital.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Canada has lagged behind many OECD countries in terms of productivity \u2014 including countries it is often compared to such as Australia, Norway and Sweden, according to the C.D. Howe report.\n\nThe authors, who zeroed in on business lending and compared Canada with a sample of other countries that are part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, concluded that credit for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) is \u201cboth less available and less affordable in Canada \u2014 a critical gap to be addressed given the strong link between SMEs and productivity growth.\u201d\n\nOmran and Kronick found that Canada \u201cranks last\u201d in small business lending as a share of total business lending among the sample OECD countries, and \u201cnear the bottom in overall business and small businesses lending as a percentage of GDP.\u201d\n\nThe report concluded that there is also a lag in fintech development in Canada, with investments totalling $263 million in the first half of 2018, compared with $16 billion in the United States and $14.2 billion in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe fintech market of New York state alone is valued at $9 billion, a figure that dwarfs Canada\u2019s $1 billion in investment since 2010, the authors note.\n\nStephen D.A. Clark, co-chair of the Financial Institutions Group at law firm Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP in Toronto, said he agrees with several of the report\u2019s conclusions.\n\n\u201cThe authors are correct about fintech,\u201d he said, adding payment systems and open banking could be put in the same category because Canada \u201clags\u201d other countries there as well.\n\n\u201cThe problem is not the banks or their willingness \u2014 it is the underlying statutory regime that needs to be updated.\u201d\n\nClark said completing such an overhaul would be a complex task because there are a number of laws to review and consider. In addition, there are jurisdictional considerations highlighted by legal and political wrangling over who controls aspects of financial services regulation governing consumer protection.\n\nThe problem is not the banks or their willingness \u2014 it is the underlying statutory regime that needs to be updated\n\n\u201cThis same refrain (calling for updated rules) has been out there for years, (but) it does not seem to be a priority for the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Clark and the report\u2019s authors pointed to a federal government pledge to relax rules for banks investing in fintechs that also do business outside the financial services sector as an example of the long road to reform.\n\n\u201cSupporting regulations have not yet been released, let alone enacted,\u201d Clark said of the pledge to relax the investment rules.\n\nOmran and Kronick suggested that removing such obstacles is key to promoting investment and productivity and scaling up fintechs.\n\nThe arrival of new fintech players has heralded both under-regulation and overregulation in the banking sector, according to the C.D. Howe report, which suggests the problem has been noted but not fully addressed.\n\nFintechs that are in the lending business, in particular, face stiff regulations similar to traditional bricks-and-mortar banks, even though the risks they pose to the system could be much lower, the authors say.\n\nThe report notes the success of structures and policies put in place to support innovative firms \u2014 such as the Canadian Securities Administrators\u2019 regulatory \u201csandbox,\u201d the Ontario Securities Commission\u2019s LaunchPad, and the FinTech Group at Quebec\u2019s Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers \u2014 but says \u201cevidence suggests that Canada is not reaching its potential\u201d compared to other jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cIn the United Kingdom, for example, and unlike many of Canada\u2019s financial sector regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has an explicit mandate to promote competition, and has established a clear link between competition and productivity,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com | Twitter: BatPost", "description": "Boost could come if rules were updated to encourage more competition from non-traditional, innovative fintech services", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/banks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
