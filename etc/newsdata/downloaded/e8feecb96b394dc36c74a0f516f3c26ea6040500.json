(AP) \u2014 Auburn starting tailback JaTarvious Whitlow sustained a knee injury in the Tigers' loss to Florida.\n\nTigers coach Gus Malzahn says Whitlow had a procedure on Tuesday and is expected to miss four to six weeks.\n\nWhitlow has rushed for 544 yards and seven touchdowns for the 12th-ranked Tigers, the second-highest total in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nAuburn has an open date this week after the 24-13 loss to No. 7 Florida.\n\nWhitlow could return in time to play against No. 3 Georgia on Nov. 16.\n\nHis absence will likely lead to increased roles for Kam Martin and Shaun Shivers. Martin has run for 174 yards and Shivers has gained 144.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
