In fact, they\u2019re such good remakes that it brings into question whether the games, especially Spyro, really deserved such attention in the first place. They were always popular, and the nostalgia appeal can\u2019t be underestimated, but few would claim they\u2019re top tier platformers.\n\nIt\u2019s a different situation for Crash Team Racing, whose quality was never in question, but PlayStation 1 game MediEvil is nowhere near as well respected. This is clearly Sony\u2019s attempt to ride the same family friendly remake bandwagon but no matter how fond your memories may be of the original it was never a particularly good game and it certainly hasn\u2019t got any better in the last 21 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough often categorised as a 3D platformer MediEvil is really closer to being a scrolling beat \u2018em-up, as there\u2019s much more combat than Crash, Spyro, or any of its other contemporaries. You play as the reanimated Sir Daniel Fortesque, mistakenly brought back to skeletal life by the evil wizard Zarok who\u2019s trying to take over the entire kingdom with an undead army. The story is pretty basic stuff but, with some clear influence from A Nightmare Before Christmas, the tone is welcomingly different to most other 3D platformers and it\u2019s obvious why Sony chose to release this just before Halloween.\n\nDespite combat being the major focus of the game, it\u2019s disappointingly basic. The most interesting aspect is the wide variety of weapons, with Dan using his own dismembered arm by default but also a wide range of swords, clubs, and ranged weapons. You can also use a shield at the same time, but it tends to be very flimsy and is best held back for more dangerous encounters.\n\nThe trick for any remake is to maintain the same basic gameplay and level layout while using modern advances in a way that compliments the original design. MediEvil doesn\u2019t really do that though, as there no real attempts to improve or change anything. Not so much out of laziness but out of an unjustified reverence for the original game.\n\nDespite claims that the movement controls have been improved they\u2019re still extremely imprecise and there remains no lock-on option. It\u2019s worth remembering that MediEvil came out a month before Zelda: Ocarina Of Time on the N64, a game which completely revolutionised 3D combat. By comparison, MediEvil has you floundering around trying to stab in vaguely the right direction and frequently failing to land a hit on enemies that are right in front of you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the camera, it was terrible in the original and by today\u2019s standards it renders the whole game almost unplayable at times. You\u2019d swear it had been specifically designed to always place itself in exactly the worst position to frame the action and it\u2019s infuriating when every defeat is because you couldn\u2019t see where you\u2019re going or couldn\u2019t judge the angle of attack properly.\n\nMediEvil (PS4) \u2013 showing its age\n\nMediEvil offers nothing of interest to do in between fights, with the simplistic platforming and puzzles being even more underdeveloped than the combat. The level design is bland and repetitive and while there are hidden areas to discover you come across many of them largely by accident, so it never feels like any kind of an achievement.\n\nPerhaps most damning is the fact that the graphics aren\u2019t even that great. They\u2019re obviously better than the original but they\u2019re nowhere close to the quality of Activision\u2019s remakes or Sony\u2019s own Shadow Of The Colossus. MediEvil clearly has a lower budget than either of those but that only begs the question of why bother at all if you\u2019re just going to do it on the cheap.\n\nIf Sony wanted to remake a classic PlayStation 1 platformer they would\u2019ve been much better off with Ape Escape, which was always a much better game and far more deserving of the attention \u2013 not to mention a new sequel. And that\u2019s just counting Sony published titles. They might not be classics themselves but everything from Pandemonium! to Klonoa: Door To Phantomile was better than MediEvil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s Sir Dan that everyone remembers, so nostalgia wins out and underserving as it may be this is the end result. The graphics are better but nothing else about MediEvil has seen any useful improvement and that means you\u2019re left playing a 20+ video game that was already deeply flawed when it first came out. Sometimes the dead should just be left to rest in peace.\n\nMediEvil PS4 review summary In Short: A remake that is loyal to a fault when it comes to honouring the original, with gameplay and design mechanics that were barely acceptable 21 years ago, let alone now. Pros: If you loved the original then this is as amorous a love letter as you could ever hope for. Cons: Dull combat with horribly imprecise controls and one of the worst cameras ever seen in a modern game. Bland level design, with few other gameplay distractions.
