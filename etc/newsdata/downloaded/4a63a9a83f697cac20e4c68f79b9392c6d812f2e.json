Highs are mainly in the low 90s, but it feels like upper 90s, with dew points near 70. Another band of thunderstorms is a decent bet, with the strongest activity probably north and east of downtown. Winds are light from the northwest. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: A few lingering thunderstorms are possible in the evening but should die out as winds shift to out of the northeast. Cooler, drier air settles in with lows in the mid- to upper 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates.

This cool marine flow keeps overcast skies in place much of the day, but there\u2019s only a slight chance for a light shower. Highs in the mid- to upper 70s with moderate humidity (dew points in the low 60s) are a nice change of pace. Confidence: Medium\n\nTomorrow night: Clouds are likely to linger much of the night as winds calm. Chances for glimpsing the \u201cHarvest\u201d full moon are not good. Lows fall to the low to mid-60s. Confidence: Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nSaturday sees clouds break up enough to allow the sun to warm us back up. Highs should reach the low to mid-80s. That warmth should help to set off some late-day thunderstorms, but most should be quickly passing. Overnight lows sink into the mid- to upper 60s. Confidence: Medium\n\nSkies are mainly sunny Sunday, with highs pushing into the mid- to upper 80s and increasingly uncomfortable humidity. Thunderstorm chances are minimal. Lows overnight should be in the mid- to upper 60s. Confidence: Medium\n\nMonday is back to uncomfortably warm and humid, with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s under sunny skies.
