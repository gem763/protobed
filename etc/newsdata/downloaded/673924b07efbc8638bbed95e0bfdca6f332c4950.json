His chief rival brushes aside the invitation.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe will listen carefully to anyone, but we will not surrender to any dictates,\u201d said Gantz, a former army chief of staff, in his first public address since election night. He said he remained committed to pursuing \u201ca broad and liberal coalition headed by myself.\u201d\n\nJilted, Netanyahu expressed dismay. \u201cI was surprised and disappointed that at this time Benny Gantz still refuses to respond to my call to meet,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time Netanyahu extended a hand to Gantz on Thursday and failed to get a warm response. When the two encountered each other at a memorial service for the late prime minister Shimon Peres, Netanyahu leaned in for a handshake, leaving Gantz looking bemused and impatient.\n\nIn his public remarks, Gantz has assumed the mantle of confident victor, emphasizing that his party had won the election.\n\nIsraeli election leaves both major parties well short of a majority\n\nWith 97 percent of the vote counted, Blue and White had secured 33 seats in the parliament, or Knesset, and Netanyahu\u2019s Likud had 31. Both parties remain far short of the 61 seats required for a governing coalition. But Netanyahu, a proven political escape artist, who is on the back foot, and Gantz \u2014 at least for now \u2014 is the one with momentum.\n\n\u201cI think what is happening now is that he can be seen as a very legitimate candidate for prime minister,\u201d Amotz Esa-El, a longtime political analyst and fellow at Jerusalem\u2019s Shalom Hartman Institute, said of Gantz.\n\nIn the faceoff between Gantz and Netanyahu, it\u2019s tempting to ask who will blink first. Gantz pledged during the campaign that he would not enter a coalition government with Likud if it were still headed by Netanyahu. Netanyahu has vowed to fight on, pressing Likud members to remain loyal to him.\n\nWhether Netanyahu\u2019s unity offer on Thursday was a gambit, a tactic or a white flag, many observers detected a whiff of deflation from the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister\n\n\u201cI think that is part of his illustrious career\u2019s death pangs,\u201d Asa-El said. \u201cIt may have been sincere, but it was very late in the day.\u201d\n\nIt was shortly after an updated vote count gave Blue and White an additional Knesset seat that Netanyahu made his surprise pitch for a power-sharing agreement.\n\n\u201cDuring the elections, I called for the establishment of the right-wing government,\u201d said Netanyahu in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, election results show that this is not possible. Therefore, there is no choice but to form a broad unity government that is as wide as possible.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s turnabout came as Israel\u2019s fractious political system enters the dealmaking phase, with the two main parties jockeying for the support of other factions in pursuit of a majority coalition.\n\nThe shortest path to a majority for either major party is to turn to the other for a coalition and share the prime minister\u2019s job and other top positions on a rotating basis. Israel has had several such unity governments, including in the 1980s when rivals Peres and Yitzhak Shamir shared power.\n\nAt the memorial service for Peres, Netanyahu called for the parties to follow that example of power-sharing.\n\n\u201cWhen there was no clear outcome from the Knesset elections, Shimon chose national unity. He and Yitzhak Shamir agreed to cooperate, to navigate Israel\u2019s path to safety,\u201d Netanyahu said in remarks at the service.\n\nBut in today\u2019s Israel \u2014 a polarized country, with Netanyahu one of its most polarizing figures \u2014 a unity government would be a tough sell, even if the two party leaders begin to talk.\n\nGantz is not alone in his camp in insisting that Netanyahu step aside as Likud party leader as a precondition of power-sharing. Many of the right-wing and religious parties that support Likud, for their part, have no love for the centrists and secularists behind Gantz.\n\nEven as he called for Gantz to join him in forming that government, Netanyahu worked to lock up support on his right. Likud announced commitments of support from three small parties that had united behind him \u2014 two representing Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox and a third that is also religious but more nationalist in nature.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I met with right-wing party leaders and we agreed that we would go into this coalition negotiation as one bloc,\u201d said Netanyahu in his statement. \u201cNow I call on you, Benny Gantz, to join us in establishing a broad unity government today. The people expect us, both of us, to show responsibility and work for cooperation.\u201d\n\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin, who will select one of the party leaders to have the first crack at forming a new government, welcomed the emerging notes of cooperation and called the rivals to negotiate.\n\n\u201cI hear, loud and clear, the voices calling for a broad and stable national unity government, and I congratulate you, Mr. Prime Minister, on joining that call this morning,\u201d Rivlin said in remarks at the Peres memorial service. \u201cThe responsibility for making it happen falls to you elected officials, especially the leaders of the major parties. The citizens of Israel have spoken.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, representatives of each of the eight parties that won Knesset seats are scheduled to visit the president\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem to formally recommend a candidate for prime minister. Rivlin will then ask one of those nominees to try to assemble a governing coalition. It is unclear when he will announce his choice.\n\nTraditionally, if the chosen leader fails to assemble a government after 28 days (or 42, if an extension is granted), the candidate will return the mandate to the president and the president will offer the chance to someone else.\n\nBut in May, after Netanyahu was stymied in assembling a coalition, he maneuvered to have parliament call Israel's second election in five months. Avigdor Liberman, the head of secular nationalist party who blocked Netanyahu in the spring, looks likely to recommend that Gantz be the first to try.\n\nGantz\u2019s party said it would meet to discuss Netanyahu\u2019s overture. But analysts cautioned that Netanyahu\u2019s strong alliance with ultra-Orthodox parties and factions on the extreme right wing would complicate negotiations.\n\nHanging over the negotiations are pending corruption charges against Netanyahu, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 3. If Gantz does get a chance to form a government next week, he may have every reason to take his time on the theory that Netanyahu will be even weaker once he is enmeshed in a formal legal battle.\n\nGantz \u201cwill let the political process be overshadowed by the legal process that is about to begin,\u201d said Esa-El. \u201cI think his calculation is then Netanyahu\u2019s own college in the Likud will show him the door.\u201d\n\nGantz campaigned on a platform of not joining a coalition with a leader who was under indictment. And much of Gantz\u2019s success, analysts say, hinges on his promise not to sit in government with Netanyahu if Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit decides to put him on trial in three pending criminal cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\n\nDan Avnon, chairman of the political science department at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said the election results showed that the majority of Israelis want a \u201cstable, normal and functioning democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis election put a stop sign to the impression that the edges determine the center, that the extremists determine the center,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Our relations are with Israel\u2019: Trump appears to give embattled Netanyahu the cold shoulder\n\nIsrael\u2019s two main parties locked in dead heat as negotiations begin over new government\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Benny Gantz, whose Blue and White party finished first in the election, insists he must lead the new government.", "authors": ["Steve Hendrix", "Feature Writer Without Portfolio Based On Local Enterprise But Filing For National", "Foreign", "Magazine", "Other Sections", "Ruth Eglash", "Reporter Covering Israel", "The Palestinian Territories"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LS35R6G22YI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
