(Kyusung Gong)\n\nNew Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees defended himself Thursday amid backlash over his recent appearance in a video publicizing an event organized by a major conservative Christian organization known for its anti-LGBT views.\n\nBrees, who has been outspoken about his faith, pushed back against accusations that he knowingly aligned himself with Focus on the Family when he shot a video for \u201cBring Your Bible to School Day.\u201d Focus on the Family was founded in 1977 and is described by the Human Rights Campaign as \u201cone of the most well funded anti-LGBTQ organizations in America.\u201d The group has sparked outcry over its apparent support of \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d the discredited practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nIn a video posted to social media on Thursday, Brees explained that he only intended to encourage students to bring their Bibles to school and \u201cbe able to live out your faith with confidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was as simple as that, so I\u2019m not sure why the negativity spread or why people tried to rope me into certain negativity,\u201d the 40-year-old said. \u201cI do not support any groups that discriminate or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality. \u2026 That\u2019s not what I stand for.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 20-second promotional clip was released late last month and does not include any mention of Focus on the Family, but it directs viewers to a website published by the group. The video was also shared on the organization\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nHopefully this sets the record straight with who I am and what I stand for. Love, Respect, and Accept ALL. I encourage you not to believe the negativity you read that says differently. It\u2019s simply not true. Have a great day. pic.twitter.com/4RdTahE7EZ \u2014 Drew Brees (@drewbrees) September 5, 2019\n\nWhen pressed by a reporter Thursday about his decision to support \u201cBring Your Bible to School Day,\u201d Brees said he was not aware of the event\u2019s connection to anti-LGBT messaging.\n\n\u201cIt was not promoting any group, certainly not promoting any group that is associated with that type of behavior,\u201d he said of the video during a post-practice media availability. \u201cI know that there are, unfortunately, Christian organizations out there that are involved in that kind of thing, and to me that is totally against what being Christian is all about. Being Christian is love. It\u2019s forgiveness, it\u2019s respecting all, it\u2019s accepting all.\u201d\n\nDrew Brees addresses his \u201cNational Bring Your Bible To School Day\u201d video that appeared on Focus on The Family platforms.\n\n\n\nHe said he was not aware of the group\u2019s anti-LGBT views. He says hate goes against everything being a Christian is all about. pic.twitter.com/Jjhexqljo0 \u2014 Amie Just (@Amie_Just) September 5, 2019\n\nBrees\u2019s troubles appeared to begin Wednesday when Big Easy magazine, a progressive publication in New Orleans, published a story titled, \u201cDrew Brees Records Video for Anti-LGBT Religious Organization.\u201d The article not only reported on the promotional video, but also found evidence that Brees has interacted with Focus on the Family dating back to 2010.\n\nThe NFL star was swiftly called out by critics. Many struggled to understand how the vocal anti-bullying advocate, whom TV host and gay rights activist Ellen DeGeneres has repeatedly fawned over, could link himself to a group that some consider to be \u201cone of the worst LGBTQIA+ bullies in the country.\u201d Focus on the Family previously partnered with former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow in 2010 for an antiabortion ad that aired during the Super Bowl.\n\nHey @TheEllenShow Could you talk to your good friend @drewbrees about making a video for Focus on the Family? I'm sure you know that's an awful group that promotes Anti-LGBTQ views. I'm all for practicing your faith, except when it promotes hate of other humans. \u2014 Christi Longlois (@Nolalongwa) September 4, 2019\n\nFocus on the Family makes its views on LGBT issues clear in numerous posts shared to its website. In one article, the group wrote that \u201csame-sex \u2018marriage\u2019\u201d has no place \u201cwithin the context of a Christian worldview,\u201d adding, \u201cAccording to the Bible, marriage is heterosexual by definition.\u201d\n\nFor many years, the organization also ran the \u201cLove Won Out\u201d ministry, which put on conferences and workshops nationwide with the goal of helping churches \u201crespond in a Christ-like way to the issue of homosexuality,\u201d according to an archived website. Anyone who struggled with \u201cunwanted same-sex attractions\u201d was offered \u201cGospel hope\u201d that their desires could be \u201covercome,\u201d the website said.\n\nOn Thursday, Brees blamed the backlash to his video on Big Easy magazine\u2019s \u201cvery negative headline,\u201d which he argued \u201cled people to believe that somehow I was aligned with an organization that was anti-LGBTQ.\u201d In an attempt to \u201cset the record straight,\u201d the athlete emphasized that he lives by \u201ctwo very simple Christian fundamentals\u201d: \u201cLove the Lord with all your heart, mind and soul, and love your neighbors yourself.\u201d The second principle, he said, means to \u201clove all, respect all and accept all.\u201d\n\nBrees continued to complain about the headline during the media availability, noting, \u201cMy intent with that video was to make a positive impact in the lives of some young people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a shame is that people make headlines just to get hits, just to get views, and all of a sudden these rumors spread that are completely untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cShame on them.\u201d\n\nIn response to Brees, Big Easy magazine tweeted, \"We were very very hurt by your actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that you would spin this in a way to suggest our publication is publishing clickbait,\u201d the news outlet wrote in another tweet.\n\nhave been accepted if you hadn\u2019t attacked us for clickbait. We were very very hurt by your actions. \u2014 Big Easy Magazine (@bigeasy_mag) September 5, 2019\n\nBy Thursday night, social media was alight with reactions to Brees\u2019s comments.\n\nIn addition to fans who assured Brees that they stood by him, former NFL running back Reggie Bush and Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) came out in defense of the quarterback.\n\n\u201cAnybody who doubts @drewbrees character or believes bogus headlines about this man does not know him period!\u201d tweeted Bush, who played with Brees in New Orleans from 2006 to 2010. \u201cHe is a great father, husband, leader, and most of all true man of god!\u201d\n\nAnybody who doubts @drewbrees character or believes bogus headlines about this man does not know him period! He is a great father, husband, leader, and most of all true man of god! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Reggie Bush (@ReggieBush) September 5, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Banks blasted \u201cthe Left,\u201d accusing critics of turning \u201can encouragement to share God\u2019s love into hate-mongering.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that the Left turns an encouragement to share God\u2019s love into hate-mongering. Neither Drew Brees nor @FocusFamily have mentioned LGBT people\u2014they\u2019ve only promoted Bring Your Bible to School Day.
