The clouds covering the megacity, almost 2,000 miles from the fires, made it impossible for residents and the rest of the world to ignore the destruction taking place.\n\nAs international leaders, environmental groups and activists condemn Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro for weakening rainforest protections, we want to hear from those who have witnessed and been directly affected by these fires \u2013 in the Amazon and across the region.\n\nFires occur every year in the region. They\u2019re mostly man-made and deliberate \u2013 farmers or ranchers clearing existing farmland, or illegal land-grabbers destroying trees. Official figures recorded 73,000 forest fires in Brazil, mostly in the Amazon, in the first eight months of 2019, the highest number since 2013. Last year there were almost 40,000 fires in the same period, according to Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research.\n\nTell us if you live or work in these areas across South America that have been impacted by forest fires. How have the fires affected communities and livelihoods? What is at stake for your local environment? How has Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency changed the situation? What have you been doing to raise awareness of the issue? Tell us how you think the international community should respond.\n\nShare your experiences\n\nYou can share your experiences in the form below.
