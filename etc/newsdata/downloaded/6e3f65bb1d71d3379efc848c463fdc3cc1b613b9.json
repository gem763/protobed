New areas being resettled with the Kurds,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Abdi said his forces had resumed working with the US-led coalition against IS in the east of the country, and insisted Washington\u2019s presence in the country was important.\n\nInternational observers have warned that the incursion could force Kurdish fighters to redeploy from jails and camps where they are guarding thousands of suspected IS fighters and family members.\n\nThat has raised fears of a resurgence by the extremists, whom the SDF expelled from their last scrap of territory in March but who continue to claim deadly attacks in Kurdish-held areas.", "description": "Ras al-Ain (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces fully withdrew from a Turkish-encircled town in northern Syria Sunday, in what", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/4fccfe_dozens-us-armoured-vehicles-escorted-by-helicopters-driving-northern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
