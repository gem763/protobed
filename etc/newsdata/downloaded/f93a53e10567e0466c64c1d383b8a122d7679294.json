Five years of fighting killed almost 400,000 people, displaced millions and plunged pockets of the country into famine. Government and opposition forces alike have been accused of committing human rights atrocities, including the use of rape as a weapon of war.\n\nAs the country slowly emerges from conflict, with a fragile peace deal signed last September, it is looking to diversify revenues instead of relying almost entirely on oil.\n\nIn February, for the first time since gaining independence in 2011, the ministry of wildlife and tourism hosted a three-day marketing workshop with the East African Community, a regional body comprised of six countries. South Sudan is working with Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, all of which have established tourism industries to make it easier for people to travel across borders.\n\nThe government is banking on the country\u2019s geographical and cultural diversity \u2013 it has 64 tribes \u2013 as well as Nile rafting tours, mountain climbing and conservation tourism to entice visitors, said Joseph Oroto, director general for tourism. A total of 16 travel agencies operate within the country, and there are more than 180 hotels in the capital, Juba.\n\nNot since the 1970s, when there was a lull between civil wars in Sudan, have tourists poured in. Less than 6% of the national budget is put towards the wildlife ministry, and last year no money was allocated towards tourism development. Visitors like Pedersen are rare.\n\nHumanitarians working in the country are reluctant to invite guests to a place that\u2019s strictly censored by the National Security Service and notorious for being more dangerous for carrying a camera than a gun.\n\nThe government knows that, without investors, the industry will take decades to develop. Companies reluctant to do business in South Sudan are waiting to see what happens in November, when opposition leader Riek Machar is expected to return and once again serve as President Salva Kiir\u2019s deputy. When the two leaders last attempted to work together, it ended in failure as fighting broke out in Juba in July 2016. Machar fled the country on foot.\n\nBut some communities are eagerly getting started. Situated on the edge of the Bire Kpatous game reserve, along the Congolese border in Western Equatoria state, villagers from Ndoromo are trying to shed a brutal past. Terrorised by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army and crippled by own civil war, locals have been increasing efforts to preserve the park and stave off poachers. The aim: enticing holidaymakers.\n\n\u201cIt would be the best thing for tourism to come here,\u201d said Masimino Pasquale, a community volunteer who patrols the reserve.\n\nBecoming a tourism hub will take some time \u2013 Ndoromo lacks basic infrastructure such as easy access to water, paved roads and buildings that could accommodate visitors.\n\nConservation experts warn against viewing tourism in Africa, especially in volatile countries like South Sudan, as a \u201csilver bullet solution\u201d, said Alison Mollon, director of the Africa programme for Fauna & Flora International, a wildlife organisation. It can work, she says, but it needs to make sense for the context and be resilient to shocks such as war.", "description": "Travel firms adopt wait-and-see approach as government seeks to entice visitors with safaris, Nile rafting and climbing trips", "authors": ["Sam Mednick In Juba"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d714bc623beb7c7c84f5bb02b298a1578b34e76c/0_228_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8aceb2be9e4b81d74c36a44b97023788", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
