Western-inspired pieces like cowboy boots and oversized belt buckles have been big trends for fall 2019, but I was hesitant to get on board.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and need another reason to giddy up and get on this trend, Etsy\u2019s in-house trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson says the site has seen a 30% uptick in searches for \u201ccowboy hats.\u201d\n\nWith stats like that, it got me thinking. Maybe I wasn\u2019t ready to go full-on cowgirl, but perhaps I could get behind something Western-inspired for fall. That\u2019s when I found a $16 women\u2019s hat on Amazon perfect for autumn that\u2019s become my favorite fall fashion accessory.\n\nThis Lisianthus women belt buckle fedora hat has a 4.2-star rating and more than 1,700 reviews on Amazon. The $16 hat is available in 16 colors, ranging from fall-friendly hues to vibrant statement shades. What I like is that it comes with a thin black belt with brass hardware \u2014 the perfect touch to make it feel a bit more authentic (and look like I spent more on it than 16 bucks).\n\nAmazon Maybe I wasn\u2019t ready to go full-on cowgirl, but I still could get behind something Western-inspired for fall. That\u2019s when I found a $16 women\u2019s hat on Amazon perfect for autumn\ufeff.\n\nIt\u2019s an affordable dupe to some of the $70-and-up Western-inspired hats at Anthropologie. For a hat skeptic, this $16 lookalike was a better fit for my style and my wallet.\n\nThe just over 2-inch brim offers nice coverage when you\u2019re outdoors (I wore it on a particularly raining day in New York, and it held up nicely). Inside, it has adjustable sizing tassels so you can adjust the size of the hat perfectly to your head. Material-conscious folks will appreciate it\u2019s made with more cotton than polyester, so it\u2019s not too hot or itchy. I even wore it hiking on a 70-degree day without breaking a sweat.\n\nI went the traditional route and opted for the camel color, and it has become my go-to for all fall festivities \u2014 apple picking, foliage hikes and beer tastings. I was even bold enough to wear it to work and snagged plenty of compliments on it throughout the day.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s something to this urban cowgirl trend after all?\n\nHuffPost This $16 Amazon hat has become my go-to for all fall festivities \u2014 apple picking, foliage hikes and beer tastings \u2014 but I've also worn it to work.", "description": "It's a perfect dupe for more expensive versions at Anthro.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8d9622100001415ad321c.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
