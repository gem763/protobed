She was fantastic in the first two films, and her presence has been greatly missed in all three of the less-than-successful follow-ups. Now finally close to 30 years later, she\u2019s back on the big screen and firing bazookas at robot assassins from the postapocalytic future. For Terminator fans, for sci-fi fans, for Linda Hamilton fans (surprisingly enough) it\u2019s a genuine pleasure to see her again, persuaded no doubt by James Cameron\u2019s return to the producer\u2019s chair.\n\nMackenzie Davis\u2019 Grace is also very good, really selling her absurdly strong cyborg character and emotionally pulling you into every action scene. You want her to succeed, you want her to save Dani, you want her to survive. There\u2019s some slightly iffy \u201cShe needs certain medication to keep her energy up\u201d syringey nonsense, but if you can swallow that, Grace is a stand-out character in the franchise and one you may want to see more of. And just to touch on Arnold himself: he\u2019s not in the film all that much \u2013 and it\u2019s a good thing too, as it\u2019s not really his story \u2013 but when he\u2019s on screen, it\u2019s a real pleasure to see a long-in-the-tooth Terminator who\u2019s used to human ways, one who has become part of a human family with his absurdly dry jokes. When he says \u201cI am extremely funny\u201d, it really tickled me.\n\nDirector Tim Miller is still best known for his break-out hit Deadpool, and when you look at the action scenes in Dark Fate, it\u2019s easy to see why they asked him on board. His VFX background obviously served him well, and there\u2019s some pleasing crunch to his fight choreography. Some of the punches and slices take place as our leads cross the Mexican border into the US, and the political angle of course adds to proceedings. As you\u2019ll see in the Cons section, Dark Fate relies heavily on Judgment Day for its action beats \u2013 the new enemy Terminator is essentially a T-800 crossed with a T-1000 \u2013 but when it gets going there\u2019s a real thump behind every blow.\n\nCons\n\nApologies for being cryptic, but as a fan of the Terminator franchise, some of Dark Fate\u2019s plot decisions are a bit \u201coff\u201d for me. Naturally to reveal them now would potentially ruin the film for you, but trust me, once you\u2019ve seen it you\u2019ll know that there\u2019s one moment in particular that feels wrong, undoing some of the hard work done in Judgment Day. What\u2019s important to remember here is that Terminator 1 and 2 work fine by themselves, and all this is easy to ignore should you wish to, but it\u2019s a shame nonetheless as part of the appeal to this much-delayed threequel is that it picks up the threads of Sarah, John and Skynet and shows you what happened next.\n\nA lot of the headlines popping up around this film scream \u201cThe best Terminator film since Judgment Day!\u201d But when you\u2019re a fan of the franchise, you know that isn\u2019t necessarily that big a compliment. It is undeniably true, however, and it\u2019s a relief to watch a Terminator film that is pointed in the right direction, so to speak, leaning hard on what worked before and maintaining that gritty, everything-is-kind-of-awful tone. But sometimes you can lean too hard on past glories and the comparison is not flattering, and this is one of those occasions. It is, in a nutshell, sometimes just too similar to Judgment Day, only not as good. For nostalgia purposes a few nods and callbacks are okay, but robotically recycling certain sequences is an unforced error.\n\nIt feels bad to call out one individual actor, but Natalia Reyes was miscast as Dani. Her character has to prop up the whole movie, but I don\u2019t think she hits every mark the film needs her to, particularly towards the end, coming over as a McGuffin the other characters are carrying around for purposes of the plot. Then again, she is ultimately\u2026 okay, as is the rest of the film in its own way. It\u2019s clunky and derivative, but it\u2019s also serviceable and occasionally fun, and for a Terminator movie these days, that\u2019s not too bad. And did I mention Linda Hamilton is back? She\u2019s great. And so is Mackenzie Davis!\n\nThree word review: Solid, clunky... fun?", "description": "And so is Arnie and his hilariously dry sense of humour", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07rv21t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
