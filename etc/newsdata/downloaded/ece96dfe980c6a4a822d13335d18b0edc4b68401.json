The event starts at 10 a.m. ET and CBCNews.ca will carry it live.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau is holding a press conference of his own on the climate plan at 12:30 p.m. ET. in Burnaby, B.C. \u2014 the riding now held by NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. CBCNews.ca will also stream that live.\n\nIn a news release, McKenna said it's time for Canada to join governments and leading businesses around the world that have committed to net zero emissions by 2050 to \"tackle the worsening climate crisis.\"\n\nA 'more prosperous' future\n\n\"We know that the strongest economies and businesses in the future will be those that embrace clean technologies. We will ensure that all Canadian workers are part of this transition to a cleaner, more prosperous and more sustainable future,\" she said.\n\nKey to the Liberal climate change action plan is the carbon tax, which set a minimum carbon price of $20 per tonne this year, increasing $10 a year to $50 by 2022. The federal government imposed the tax on businesses and individuals in provinces with no federally approved carbon pricing plan. In those provinces, the government is handing back carbon tax rebates to most residents. Several provinces have challenged the tax in court challenges without success.\n\nThe Conservatives are campaigning against the carbon tax, calling it a \"Liberal tax grab\" that hikes costs for consumers.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has said his first act in government would be to scrap the tax.", "description": "The Liberals are promising to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050, joining the European Union and countries making the\u00a0same pledge at the United Nations\u00a0in New York City this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5190898.1561649927!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/carbon-tax-20190625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
