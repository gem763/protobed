People love it when they get here,\u201d said Joan Levinson, a Paradise Valley luxury real estate expert with Realty ONE Group.\n\nMore: North Scottsdale Appeals for Its Climate, Low Taxes and Golf\n\nBoundaries\n\nParadise Valley, equidistant from the downtown areas of Phoenix and Scottsdale, is roughly bordered by Gold Dust Avenue to the north and Camelback Mountain to the south, Scottsdale Road to the east, and a rough western border as far as 32 Street.\n\nPrice Range\n\n\u201cIf you want a ranch-style home on a decent-sized lot with nice views, you\u2019re looking at a minimum of $1 million,\u201d said Bob Hassett of Russ Lyon Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. At that price point, though, buyers are generally considering land value with the intent to tear down an older home to build new.\n\nMs. Levinson reports that higher-end homes in Paradise Valley range from $3 million to $6 million, with single-family homes averaging under $3.4 million and $403.71 per square foot. She noted that prices can climb much higher, especially if they are on larger lots (between two and five acres).\n\nIn March 2019, one extraordinary home sold for a record-setting $15.68 million, Ms. Levinson said. The 31,000-square-foot home, called Villa Paradiso, included an indoor basketball court and even a hair salon.\n\nThere are no condominiums in the area currently, but those under construction by the Ritz-Carlton are anticipated to be listed between $1.8 million and $5.7 million. The luxury resort is slated to open in summer 2020.\n\nThis privately gated, 5-acre palatial estate in Paradise Valley is listed for $13.4 million.

Paradise Valley offers \u201ceverything from Spanish Colonial to Santa Fe to Santa Barbara to Mediterranean to contemporary.\u201d Ms. Levinson likewise noted the great variety of sizes, ages and styles of homes, adding that contemporary homes are particularly sought-after.\n\nZoning codes for Paradise Valley ensure that all single-family homes are located on lots of at least one acre and that homes occupy only 25% of their lots. The heights of homes are limited, too. The result, Mr. Hassett said, is that the neighborhood has a rural feel even while it is located within close proximity of everything Phoenix and Scottsdale have to offer, and the exceptional views that draw so many buyers are preserved.\n\nWith ample space, views of Arizona\u2019s natural beauty, and a pleasant climate, many homes feature retractable glass walls and outdoor entertaining spaces to facilitate indoor-outdoor living. Larger homes, especially those on larger lots, come with amenities such as pools and pool houses, tennis and basketball courts, and large garages.\n\nMore: Baseball Hall of Famer Randy Johnson Sells Arizona Home for $7.3 Million at Auction\n\nInside, homes in the luxury market commonly include amenities such as a wine cellar or room, a home theater, a gym or exercise room, and a sauna or spa. Many buyers, anticipating welcoming extended family, seek out homes with suites, multiple family rooms, guest houses, casitas and ramadas, Mr. Danley said.\n\nOne exceptional 25,000-square-foot home currently on the market for just shy of $15 million includes all of those amenities, as well as a two-story library, multiple elevators, and a shooting range.\n\nParadise Valley is populated almost exclusively by single-family homes and bordered by a handful of resort communities, but the Ritz-Carlton is currently constructing an enclave centered around a hotel that will include condominiums, Ms. Levinson said.\n\nAn interior view of a six-bedroom, ultra-luxury home in Paradise Valley.

He and Mr. Danley both said that the diverse architecture of the neighborhood also makes it unique.\n\nAlthough Paradise Valley used to be considered quite rural, as Phoenix and Scottsdale have grown up around it, it has come to enjoy both proximity to the amenities of both cities and a tranquil atmosphere. \u201cArizona enjoys the best weather in the United States,\u201d Ms. Levinson said, adding that the streets of Paradise Valley are immaculately clean and free of traffic. Bisected by only two or three through streets, the neighborhood is very much a private enclave, but it is by no means isolated.\n\nThis 16,000 square feet Paradise Valley home comes with patios, pool, pond with water feature and a detached guest house. The home is asking for $12.95 million.

Phoenix\u2019s Biltmore Fashion Park is an upscale shopping mall that includes Saks Fifth Avenue. The Palmeraie Shops, to be part of the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s $2-billion project on the border between Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, will also offer luxury shopping and specialty boutique. The developer, Five Star, is consulting with Hanna Struever, whose similar development in Dallas includes the likes of Herm\u00e8s, Chanel, Dior, Christian Louboutin, and Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nNumerous resorts are within a 15-minute drive of Paradise Valley. Mountain Shadows Resort houses condominiums and offers golfing, a spa and a fitness center, a hotel, and several dining options. Camelback Inn offers golfing, a spa, and numerous upscale restaurants.\n\n\u201cIn the last 20 years, a wide variety of excellent restaurants have come to Paradise Valley, including a few \u2018foodie\u2019 destinations\u201d Mr. Danley said. Lincoln Steakhouse, Bar 1936, and Rita\u2019s Kitchen, which features Southwestern cuisine, are all located within the JW Marriott Camelback Inn Resort and offer great views of Camelback and the Sonoran Desert as well as indoor-outdoor dining. El Chorro, in the heart of Paradise Valley, serves up American fare and offers incredible view of Camelback and Mummy mountains.\n\nAmong several private schools in Paradise Valley, Phoenix Country Day School serves students from pre-k through grade 12, and the Jones-Gordon School serves grades 1 through 12.\n\nMany buyers also find Paradise Valley attractive because of its proximity to both Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Scottsdale Airport. \u201cPart of what we offer is that we\u2019re only about 15 or 20 minutes from either one. From North Scottsdale, it could take an hour or more,\u201d Ms. Levinson said.\n\nTwo medical centers, Lincoln Plaza and Mountain View, are also found in Paradise Valley.\n\nMore: Mansion in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Ask $26 Million\n\nWho Lives There\n\nIn the past, Paradise Valley has attracted more seasonal residents during the colder months in the east due to its climate and proximity to multiple airports, but in recent decades, the area has become increasingly popular among year-round owners. Mr. Danley said buyers are skewing younger, particularly those in business and the tech industry.\n\n\u201cRecently, there has been an influx of people from northern and southern California because of the lower cost of living and taxation,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia has always been a good feeder market for the area.\u201d\n\nMs. Levinson also noted this wave of buyers, saying that comparable homes in Paradise Valley cost anywhere from one-third to one-half of what they would cost in California. She added that many doctors, lawyers, and athletes are attracted to Paradise Valley.\n\nView of a Paradise Valley mountain top home's helipad. This property is currently listed for $25 million.

Derrick Hall and Ken Kendrick, president and managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, respectively, reportedly have homes in Paradise Valley, as do Marc and Emily Nemer, co-founders of Ganesh Capital, and members of the Walton family.\n\nBillionaire Bennett Dorrance, Charles Barkley, and Michael Phelps have reportedly owned homes in Paradise Valley.\n\nOutlook\n\nSince the economic downturn of 2008, the market has steadily recovered and new construction is on the rise. Ms. Levinson reported that the $3 million- to- $7 million market is doing very well due to this new construction and that homes in the $1.8-million to $2.2-million range are more difficult to find. She estimated that the market has come back up about two-thirds, compared to 2006-2008. Dub Dellis, COO of Walt Danley Realty, reported over 20 sales over $5 million so far this year, compared to an average of just under seven sales per year over the past five years.\n\nThe market is currently balanced between buyers and sellers, Mr. Hassett said, \u201cbut if it\u2019s leaning any way, it\u2019s toward sellers. The $3-million-plus market is busier than ever.\u201d\n\nMore: Cowboy-Financier Lists Two Ranches in $50 Million Package\n\nSince Paradise Valley is \u201cland-locked,\u201d as Mr. Danley put it, completely surrounded by Phoenix and Scottsdale, the amount of stock is more or less capped, making it a question of supply and demand.\n\nUnlike Mr. Hassett, Mr. Danley expects it to be more of a buyer\u2019s market going forward, noting that especially in the luxury market, homes tend to take longer to sell. In the $7 million plus market, owners regularly work with designers who seek out the finest finishes available in the world, Mr. Hassett said, and they can often afford to wait for the perfect buyer to come along.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Danley said, the area has seen consistent \u201cgrowth and maturation of the community. There\u2019s more to do, more to see, more to enjoy than ever.\u201d\n\nClick for more profiles of high-end neighborhoods around the world\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["A.M.
