We cannot be serious about cracking down on the ways social media companies allow hate speech, disinformation, lies, and threats of violence to flourish on their platforms if we do not demand accountability across the board.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Politics Twitter-Kamala-Harris-Trump-Account Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
