The country\u2019s most influential cleric pinned the blame for the violence on politicians who had failed to improve the lives of the public, and ordered them to meet the protesters\u2019 demands.\n\nAnother politically powerful cleric pulled his opposition faction\u2019s lawmakers out of parliament, a gesture certain to fuel the passions behind the unrest.\n\nOn the streets of Baghdad, Reuters reporters saw one protester fall to the ground after being shot in the head. He was pronounced dead at hospital. Elsewhere, a Reuters television crew saw a man critically wounded by a gunshot to the neck after snipers on rooftops opened fire at a crowd.\n\nThe violence comes two years after Iraq put down the insurgency by the Sunni Muslim armed group Islamic State. The protests arose in the south, heartland of the Shi\u2019ite majority, but has quickly spread, with no formal leadership from any organised political or sectarian movement.\n\nSecurity and medical sources gave a death toll early on Friday of 46 killed in three days of unrest, the vast majority of the deaths in the last 24 hours as the violence accelerated.\n\n\u201cIt is sorrowful that there have been so many deaths, casualties and destruction,\u201d Iraq\u2019s most influential cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said in a letter read out by his representative during a sermon.\n\n\u201cThe government and political sides have not answered the demands of the people to fight corruption or achieved anything on the ground,\u201d said Sistani, who stays out of day-to-day politics but whose word is law for Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019ites. \u201cParliament holds the biggest responsibility for what is happening.\u201d\n\nPopulist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who leads the largest opposition bloc in parliament, ordered his lawmakers to suspend participation in the legislature until the government introduces a programme that would serve all Iraqis.\n\n\u201cWE WALK AMONG YOU\u201d\n\nThe violence is an unprecedented test for Adel Abdul Mahdi, a mild-mannered veteran politician who came to power last year as a compromise candidate backed by powerful Shi\u2019ite groups that dominated Iraq since the downfall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nIn his overnight address, Abdul Mahdi pledged reforms but said there was no \u201cmagic solution\u201d to Iraq\u2019s problems. He insisted politicians were aware of the suffering of the masses: \u201cWe do not live in ivory towers - we walk among you in the streets of Baghdad,\u201d he said.\n\nA young man in a crowd fleeing sniper shots at a central Baghdad square in the morning was scornful. \u201cThe promises by Adel Abdul Mahdi are to fool the people, and today they are firing live gunshots at us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cToday this was a peaceful protest. They set up these barricades, and the sniper is sitting right there since last night.\u201d\n\nA man is seen on the street during a curfew, three days after the nationwide anti-government protests turned violent, in Baghdad, Iraq October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Khalid al-Mousily\n\nPolice and medical sources told Reuters the death toll included 18 people killed in the southern city of Nassiriya, 16 in the capital Baghdad, four in the southern city of Amara and four in Baquba as unrest spread north of the capital. Deaths were also reported in the southern cities of Hilla and Najaf.\n\nCurfews were imposed in a number of cities. Authorities shut roads into the capital from the north and northeast and were sending reinforcements to Baghdad\u2019s densely-populated east. Military convoys were being sent to Nassiriya.\n\nLate on Thursday protesters in Baghdad gathered in darkness by a bonfire set among the flaming wreckage of an armoured vehicle, across the Tigris River from the government compound.\n\n\u201cThey are shooting live fire at the Iraqi people and the revolutionaries. We can cross the bridge and take them out of the Green Zone!\u201d a man shouted to Reuters TV.\n\n\u201cAbdul Mahdi, they will cross the bridge. You better resign. Resign. The people demand the fall of the regime!\u201d he shouted as the crowd behind him took up a chant that swept the Middle East during popular uprisings across the region in 2011: \u201cThe people demand the fall of the regime!\u201d\n\n\u201cREVOLUTION OF HUNGER\u201d\n\nThe unrest comes on the eve of Arbaeen, a Shi\u2019ite pilgrimage which in recent years has drawn 20 million worshippers, trekking for days on foot across southern Iraq in the world\u2019s biggest annual gathering, ten times the size of the Mecca Hajj.\n\nSome pilgrims were already taking to the roads on Friday, although in smaller numbers than in recent years. Iran has closed one of the border crossings used by millions of pilgrims. Qatar has told its citizens to stay away.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nA senior Iranian cleric blamed the unrest on the United States and Israel, saying they aimed to thwart the pilgrimage.\n\nThe protests could grow if they receive formal backing from Sadr, who has long denounced corruption and the political elite. Parliament was set to hold a session dedicated to finding a solution, but members Sadr\u2019s faction said it would stay away.\n\nSadr has not called on his followers to join the protests, but his faction has expressed sympathy with their aims. One senior Sadrist politician, Awad Awadi, described the protests to Reuters as \u201ca revolution of hunger.\u201d\n\nTwo years after the defeat of the Islamic State Sunni militant movement, Iraq has finally been at peace and free to trade for the first extended period since the 1970s, with oil exports at record levels. But Iraqis say they have seen few benefits, with infrastructure still in ruins and jobs scarce.", "description": "Dozens of demonstrators were killed across Iraq on Thursday and Friday as violent protests against government corruption swelled into a mass spontaneous uprising sweeping much of the country, the worst unrest since the defeat of Islamic State.", "authors": ["Ahmed Rasheed", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436940568&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930IC", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
