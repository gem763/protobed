Restaurants are full; the scars aren\u2019t so visible. Sure, people are less fragile, less vulnerable, maybe also less kind to strangers, the same way they were after the attacks of November 13, 2015, when sitting outside at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 seemed like an act of defiance. Yet over the past year, since the \u201cyellow-vest\u201d protest movement began, the conversation has shifted from terrorism to questions of income inequality.\n\nStill, France remains in a state of emergency, with the government warning of the high risk of a terrorist attack. In honoring the victims of the police-headquarters killings yesterday, French President Emmanuel Macron said that security forces had thwarted 59 terrorist attacks in the past six years, and that the country would continue to fight the \u201cIslamist hydra,\u201d a multiheaded monster. Security services have to be right every time, though\u2014terrorists have to be right just once.\n\nRead: What the November 13 attacks taught Paris\n\nOn national radio this week, France\u2019s interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said he could not rule out that the attacker, a man whose job was to help protect France from terrorist attacks, had shared some of the confidential information to which he had access. Castaner defended himself against opponents calling for his resignation, and will be questioned by lawmakers this week.\n\nThe attack has caused a crisis of confidence in Macron\u2019s government, Le Monde editorialized. The state has been \u201cinfected with the cancer of Islamism,\u201d said the conservative daily Le Figaro, which also decried what it called \u201cdenial-Islam,\u201d a play on words suggesting the government\u2019s denial of militant Islam\u2019s risks. The left-wing daily Lib\u00e9ration wrote that if the attacker \u201chad for several years calmly forwarded data from the Paris Police intelligence office to a nebulous jihadist, we would be facing a major security and political problem.\u201d\n\nThe attacker was identified by French media as Mick\u00e4el Harpon, 45, born in Martinique, frustrated that his deafness might have hindered his advancement at work. After jihadists murdered 12 people and wounded others in an attack on the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, Harpon apparently told his colleagues that he \u201cunderstood\u201d the attackers. A complaint was filed against him over the remarks, but apparently nothing came of it. He reportedly frequented a mosque where a Moroccan-born imam routinely preached hate.\n\nFrance\u2019s police department \u201cshould examine its conscience,\u201d Gilles Kepel, one of the country\u2019s most prominent scholars of Islam and terrorism, told Le Figaro. When the attack took place, Kepel said, he was just blocks from the police headquarters, attending the trial of two women who in 2016 recorded a video swearing allegiance to the Islamic State and attempted to blow up a car filled with gas containers on a touristy street facing Notre-Dame\u2014the street that houses Shakespeare and Company, the historic and much-beloved bookstore. Their plot backfired when the car didn\u2019t catch fire, and they were arrested.", "description": "The French capital suffered a wave of violence in 2015 and 2016 and while recent years have been more peaceful, a recent attack resurfaced unease.", "authors": ["Rachel Donadio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX76NMT/facebook.jpg?1570561772", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
