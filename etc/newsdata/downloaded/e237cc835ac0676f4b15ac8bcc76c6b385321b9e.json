The War on Terror Will Create Another.", "language": "en", "text": "After U.S. special operations forces dealt a violent end to the leader of the premier jihadist group in Iraq, the president hailed the importance of the moment.\n\nThe man was a monster, the president declared, responsible for a regional campaign of devastation, even the beheadings of American hostages. True, the killing would not mean the end of the broader war, the president noted, but the U.S. had dealt \u201ca severe blow\u201d to the jihadists.\n\nGeorge W. Bush said this in 2006, following the killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nAfter U.S. special operations forces dealt a violent end to the leader of the global jihadist movement, the president hailed the importance of the moment. The man was a monster, the president declared, responsible for a global campaign of devastation, and particularly the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 Americans. True, the killing would not mean the end of the broader war, the president noted, but the U.S. had reaped \u201cthe most significant achievement to date\u201d against the jihadists.\n\nBarack Obama said this in 2011, following the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nAfter U.S. special operations forces ensured a violent end for the leader of a new global jihadist movement, the president hailed the importance of the moment. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a monster, the president declared, responsible for a global campaign of devastation, even the beheadings of American hostages. True, the killing would not mean the end of the broader war, the president noted, but it showed that \u201cthese savage monsters will never escape their fate.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump said this on Sunday, following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nThese three fatal milestones all point to the strategic incoherence within a global war that has now lasted an entire generation. No one, neither the Trump administration nor its critics, believes that the so-called Islamic State is finished because al-Baghdadi is dead. As proficient as U.S. special operators have become at manhunting these past 18 years, and as central as manhunting has been during that time, there is no campaign plan, not even a theory, by which the killings of jihadist leaders knit up into a lasting victory. Asking for one would require reckoning with the catastrophic failure represented by a war that only perpetuates itself.\n\nThere would be no Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had Bush not invaded and occupied Iraq in 2003. That war created an opportunity for a mass murderer, Zarqawi, to construct an al-Qaeda franchise more bloodthirsty than even the one bin Laden created. Even after Zarqawi\u2019s 2006 death, Bin Laden could never rein in al-Qaeda in Iraq, documents recovered after the 2011 raid on his Abbottabad compound showed, and he grew particularly dyspeptic over the offshoot\u2019s clear desire to declare a caliphate.\n\n\u201c This history matters because it shows that the expansive war the U.S. launched does not fight against a static enemy. It generates enemies and provides opportunities for new ones to arise. \u201d\n\nSome believe bin Laden is the real victor of the war on terrorism, since he succeeded at provoking the U.S. into endless war in unfamiliar terrain. But the rise of ISIS showed bin Laden lost control of the movement he started. Bin Laden did not believe the time was right for a caliphate. Baghdadi took advantage of both the Syrian civil war and Obama\u2019s 2011 withdrawal from Iraq to make the caliphate a brutal fascist reality, complete with misogynist enslavement and opportunities for men to find meaning through sanctified violence. When al-Qaeda and the elder generation of jihadist theorists opposed ISIS, Baghdadi\u2019s organization\u2014now an actual state, complete with an army, and a flag\u2014had no problem attacking them. Baghdadi was less visible than bin Laden, rebuking the leadership style of a previous generation and signaling that the caliphate was more important than he was. The caliphate was ISIS\u2019 triumph over bin Laden, whose children ate his revolution.\n\nThis history matters because it shows that the expansive war the U.S. launched does not fight against a static enemy. It generates enemies \u2013 the slain al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki is another example \u2013 and provides opportunities for new ones to arise. Baghdadi himself experienced four years of captivity in the U.S. detention facility at Camp Bucca in Iraq before his 2009 release. Trump on Sunday recalled the horror of seeing American detainees dressed in orange jumpsuits without recalling that ISIS chose the orange jumpsuits to evoke the ones worn by detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nNo one should think the fall of the caliphate, let alone Baghdadi\u2019s death, means that U.S.\u2019 jihadist adversaries have achieved their final form. Whatever else the war on terrorism is, its history shows it yielding further generations of jihadists as long as there are American forces hunting, surveilling, and killing Muslims worldwide. Part of that dynamic involves those newer generations emerging when U.S. forces pull back but leave intact the apparatus of the war on terrorism\u2014the drone strikes, the surveillance dragnets, the lethal raids\u2014as happened in Iraq in 2011 and, very likely, now in Syria in 2019. Maintaining that apparatus is supposed to hedge against withdrawals from agonizing ground conflicts. Yet at each turn of the war\u2019s ratchet, the jihadists have only come back in more violent form and greater mass, the exact opposite of what any war is supposed to achieve.\n\nTrump\u2019s pullback from northeastern Syria, like from the Forever War more broadly, was never total. Like Obama before him, Trump\u2019s rhetoric about wishing to be done with endless wars obscures the reality of how he prosecutes them. Trump escalated drone strikes in the undeclared regions of the war on terrorism and, in Afghanistan, escalated air strikes, with a commensurate rise in civilian deaths. Syria has long displayed the decadence of a strategically exhausted war on terrorism: Obama invaded without congressional approval\u2014to no real congressional outrage\u2014and Trump has made the residual mission one of plundering oil and, in the background, threatening Iran. Trump made clear last week that he expects \u201cTurkey, Syria and others in the region\u201d to do the work of preventing an ISIS return.\n\nAll that means ISIS, in whatever future form, has a new lease on life. A series of ISIS jailbreaks occurred after Trump\u2019s green light for the Turkish invasion led the United States\u2019 Syrian Kurdish partners to prioritize their own survival. Like Baghdadi out of Camp Bucca, new generations of ISIS leadership may have made their way out of the Syrian prisons. The U.S. is hardly the only actor that matters here: the unconcluded Syrian civil war helps set the context for whatever comes next, and the U.S. has never been able to shape events within that war. Nicholas Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center from the dawn of the anti-ISIS war until 2017, tweeted that Baghdadi\u2019s death was a \u201cbig blow\u201d to ISIS but \u201cmay not leave us safer from ISIS attack.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s pullback from northeastern Syria has troubled American strategists. The persistence of the war on terrorism, which set the context for that pullback, troubles them less. At a Reuters forum in September, I asked former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis why military officers never put forward a theory of victory in the war on terrorism. He responded that terrorism was a persistent reality, \u201can ambient threat,\u201d and so was an American response. \u201cThis desire to have the war over, I understand it, but this is a war that springs from root causes that will have to be addressed at the same time we\u2019re fighting,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cIt will be there throughout our lifetimes.\u201d\n\nTerrorism, as old as human history, will indeed be present throughout our lifetimes. But that elides the choice America makes to wage a war against it that only makes jihadism worse. While the bombs drop, American officials never get around to addressing Mattis\u2019 undefined \u201croot causes,\u201d because some of those root causes are the bombs themselves . And all that means Baghdadi\u2019s death gains the U.S. as much as the broader war on terrorism does: ultimately nothing, only a fleeting feeling of national pride briefly concealing the worsening wreckage of a generation.", "description": "A U.S. raid doomed the leader of the so-called Islamic State.
