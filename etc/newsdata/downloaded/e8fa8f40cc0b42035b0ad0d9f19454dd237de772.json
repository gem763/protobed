As a result, more and more services are adding features that speak to their users\u2019 privacy concerns. If you\u2019re a YouTube viewer (and who isn\u2019t these days?), one of these concerns is probably your viewing history, which can tell marketers and other third parties more about you than you probably want them to know.\n\nRelated Google announces three new ways to hide your personal activity from Google\n\nOne way to prevent that type of intrusion is to delete that history. While you could previously delete your history manually (see below), Google has recently made the process automatic so you no longer have to remind yourself to perform the task regularly.\n\nTo set your YouTube account to automatically delete your history:\n\nGo to the Activity controls for your YouTube history. You can either follow this link to get there directly, or you can get started from your main Google account page. Find and click on the \u201cData & personalizations\u201d tab, then \u201cYouTube history\u201d > \u201cManage activity.\u201d\n\nUnder YouTube History, you\u2019ll see two boxes. The right-hand box helps you determine if and when your history of YouTube viewing and searching will be deleted. If you\u2019ve never been on this page before, it will probably say \u201cKeeping activity until you delete it manually.\u201d Click just below that on the link that reads \u201cChoose to delete automatically.\u201d\n\nYou can select to have Google delete your YouTube history after three months or after 18 months. Click on the option you prefer.\n\nConfirm your preference. Google will tell you at this point if you have anything that will be deleted immediately (because it\u2019s older than three or 18 months).\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you\u2019re done!\n\nIncidentally, if you\u2019d rather simplify things and not save your history at all, you can do that as well. Start from the YouTube History page and look at the left-hand box; it will say whether your YouTube history is on or off. If it\u2019s on and you want it to be off:\n\nClick on \u201cChange setting\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll see two checkboxes, one that says \u201cInclude the YouTube videos you watch\u201d and the other that says \u201cIncludes your searches on YouTube.\u201d If you uncheck either, you will pause the collection of that particular history.\n\nIf you want to pause both, move the toggle above them to the \u201coff\u201d position.\n\nFinally, if you want to just get rid of your entire viewing history right now:\n\nOn the YouTube History page, click on the three dots on the right side of the top search box.\n\nClick on the link \u201cDelete activity by\u201d\n\nDelete your activity for the last hour, the last day, for all time, or within a custom range. There is also a link that will take you to the same automatic delete choices that we described earlier.", "description": "While you could previously delete your YouTube history manually, Google has recently made the process automatic so you no longer have to remind yourself to perform the task regularly.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vsqsQKpOwkU4UcWtSj7KuUI8aZo=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10158491/acastro_180202_1777_0003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
