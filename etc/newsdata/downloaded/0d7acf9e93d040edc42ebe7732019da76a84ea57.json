Unfortunately, that\u2019s about the best one can say for it.\n\nJohnson had vowed to improve on the exit agreement secured by his predecessor, Theresa May, and arguably he has succeeded in some respects. His deal replaces the hated U.K.-wide \u201cbackstop\u201d that May agreed to with one that applies only to Northern Ireland; leaves Northern Ireland aligned with the EU\u2019s single market; imposes a customs boundary in the Irish Sea, thereby avoiding a hard border with Ireland; and creates a complicated system for lawmakers to eventually opt out of the arrangement.\n\nThis approach resolves or elides some of the dilemmas that led Parliament to reject May\u2019s deal three times over. And it\u2019s surely better than a chaotic and costly no-deal exit.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s nothing to celebrate. By ditching the customs union and abandoning May\u2019s commitment to a close trading relationship in goods, it will wrench Britain further away from the EU and impose more costs and barriers. By one estimate, based on the government\u2019s stated goals, Britain\u2019s per-capita gross domestic product could be reduced by more than 6% over 10 years, only slightly better than leaving with no deal at all.\n\nThe rationale for this approach is that the U.K., free of the EU\u2019s meddlesome restraints, will be able to conclude its own free-trade deals around the world. There are reasons for skepticism. Of the 40 or so deals the EU has in place, Britain has so far managed to \u201croll over\u201d just 15. And by the government\u2019s own reckoning, additional deals would probably add only about 0.7% to GDP over the long-term.\n\nMore ominously, Johnson\u2019s deal could place further strain on Britain\u2019s union. Scotland may demand similar treatment to Northern Ireland or once again pursue independence. The logic of a united Ireland may become more compelling as Great Britain and Northern Ireland diverge. Even many Welsh now say that independence would be preferable to leaving the EU, a sentiment that could intensify as the U.K. becomes less competitive.\n\nWith the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31 bearing down, Parliament will convene Saturday to consider the deal. Its prospects are tenuous. The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Johnson\u2019s ostensible majority, has already rejected it. Brexit hardliners may yet find it insufficient. (Nigel Farage, for one, insists the deal is \u201cnot Brexit.\u201d) And Johnson will have to plead for votes from quite a few Tories whom he recently expelled from the party.\n\nThe best path forward would be for lawmakers to demand that this deal, if it passes, be ratified by a second referendum. That would confer some measure of democratic legitimacy on a bargain that looks very different from what Brexit campaigners originally promised. It would give voters an informed choice now that the costs and benefits of leaving are clearer. And it would make the deal more sustainable as Britain and the EU prepare for many months of grueling talks over their future relationship.\n\nNot least, it would also offer voters a final chance to do the right thing and reverse this calamitous process. Johnson\u2019s deal may have avoided the worst. But the one thing it cannot paper over is that Brexit remains a terrible idea.\n\n--Editors: Timothy Lavin, Clive Crook.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The deal that U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just negotiated with the European Union isn\u2019t the worst conceivable outcome to the long saga of Brexit.
