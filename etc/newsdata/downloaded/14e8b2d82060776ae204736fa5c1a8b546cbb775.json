They may even have basements or conservatories added.\n\nJust as with children's dollhouses, the range of accessories for the interiors of these adult dollhouses is extensive. They range from various types of book cases and sofas, to candlesticks and flower vases.\n\nIt is even possible to get a laptop or a jewellery box in miniature - and the items of furniture are certainly cheaper than purchasing the real life versions.\n\nUpstairs downstairs: This older style dollhouse comes with an additional basement\n\nOliver Appleby, director of Streets Ahead Dollshouse, explains: 'People are fascinated with dollhouses due to the novelty of miniature representations of real items.\n\n'Being able to own and order your own miniature house with everything in its place, as many rooms as you can imagine, and decorate in period splendour, ultra-modern minimalism, or a mix of both fulfils a real creative hobby and psychological need in people.'\n\nDollhouses come in all shapes and sizes, with thousands of miniature products for inside\n\nCooking up a storm: Miniature ovens come with pans and saucepans\n\nLike real life homes, dollhouses can have LED lighting, wallpaper and fireplaces\n\nWhile it is possible to start off with the basics and a small budget of around \u00a3100, dollhouses can also prove big business with Mr Applyby suggesting that costs can soon run into thousands of pounds.\n\nHe said: 'The houses that we supply begin with retail prices under \u00a3100 for a first time collector's house, flat packed and painted with minimal construction.\n\n'This then goes up to 15 room mansions with servant's quarters retailing for up to \u00a31,000. But this is for an unpainted DIY kit, so there is some building work still required.\n\n'There are still dollhouse builders in Britain making small run or bespoke houses to order. The sky is the limit and price tags in the tens or even hundreds of thousands are possible if you want one of a kind perfection.'\n\nAttention to detail, this dollhouse item has areas to stack plates and other household goods\n\nKeep your dollhouse warm with a decorative fireplace that fits into the colour scheme\n\nInterior products available include sofas, book shelves and rugs - and even pets\n\nFulfilling your interior design urges with a dollhouse does not have to stop with how you would like your home to look. For it is also possible to get other types of buildings in miniature.\n\nMr Applyby explained: 'We have seen people make everything from childhood homes or favorite shops and film locations to fantasy castles and Halloween houses of horror.\n\n'We have been bringing new products out every year since we started and are always working towards ever better miniature representations of every day items. From 'sheets' of metro tiles to bring your miniature bathroom or kitchen right up to date to real Turkish carpets - actually made in Turkey - for traditional entrance halls and grand sitting rooms.\n\n'Many people just want a little hobby to escape every day life and 'play' with their collection, alone or with children.\n\n'Others work towards grand personal statements or artistic masterpieces to proudly display to friends and family. Everyone can join in for far less time, money and mess than renovating their real home or moving to a country house.'\n\nCaroyln Annette, of dollshousehampshire.co.uk agreed, saying: 'We provide everything from the houses to the wallpaper - and there are dozens of types of wallpaper.\n\n'Indeed there are thousands of different products for dollhouses, and you can spend as little - or as much - as you want.'\n\nA wide selection of crockery is available for dollhouses, including this more traditional design", "description": "Dollhouses can help you to explore your interior design ideas with having to spend time and money on changing your actual home.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/11/19199414-0-image-a-19_1570013594851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
