However, their sixth-place Premier League finish last season saw them fail to qualify for Europe\u2019s elite club competition, meaning turnover in 2020 is expected to drop to between \u00a3560m and \u00a3580m.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r\u2019s rebuild talk cannot mask Manchester United\u2019s sense of drift Read more\n\nThe Red Devils are already 10 points adrift of Liverpool after only six top-flight matches this term, but Woodward set out a long-term vision as he promised to stand by Solskj\u00e6r. United\u2019s executive vice-chairman said on the club\u2019s quarterly investors\u2019 call: \u201cWe and our growing global fan-base demand success. Success means winning trophies. That target and that standard has never changed for Manchester United.\n\n\u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made on the business side underpins the continued investment in the football side. Much of the progress made around that investment in the academy, the recruitment department and the training ground facilities is behind the scenes and therefore isn\u2019t immediately apparent to those on the outside looking in.\n\n\u201cThese investments, together with the commitment we\u2019ve made to Ole and his coaching staff in March have given us the building blocks for success. Whilst we\u2019re confident this investment will deliver results, it\u2019s important that we are patient while Ole and his team build for the future. We will continue to focus on the long-term strategy and won\u2019t be influenced by short-term distractions. We\u2019re optimistic for the future.\u201d\n\nDespite a significant outlay on the likes of defenders Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka and winger Daniel James over the summer, United\u2019s inability to replace striker Romelu Lukaku has been scrutinised.\n\nThe three additions and a number of first-team players signing new contracts means United\u2019s wage bill reached an eye-watering \u00a3332.3m, an increase of \u00a336.3m on the previous year and accounting for 53% of their turnover.\n\nWhile they are yet to appoint a director of football, Woodward said: \u201cRegarding the speculation around the head of football, we\u2019re continually reviewing and looking at the potential to evolve our structure on the football side. Much of the speculation on this type of role focuses purely on recruitment, an area we\u2019ve evolved in recent years.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r defends United players and rues missed \u2018big chances\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cWe feel that the players we\u2019ve signed this summer demonstrate that this approach is the right one. Returning to the roots of our club\u2019s ethos of youth-led, attacking football is the right way forward and everyone at the club: the board, the manager, the squad and all of the staff remain resolute in our desire to get Manchester United back to the top of English football.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make the necessary investments to make this happen across our first-team players, our academy and our recruitment department. This long-term approach to building a squad is the right one.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s accounts showed that operating profit is up to \u00a350m, while the net debt has come down to \u00a3203.6m.", "description": "Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has pledged his faith in Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ebd495a2839a6c6eac024cecdc4f1551fae8699/0_0_1898_1139/master/1898.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c486151ffb50111e802a2da113b15f37", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
