Giuliani described his controversial involvement in U.S. foreign affairs Friday as part of a mission to \u201cdisrupt the world.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani, the former two-term Republican mayor of New York City, made the remark on Fox News in response to being asked about his attempts to have the Ukrainian government investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political rival, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cA lot of people look at this situation and they say \u2018What exactly are you doing in this situation?\u2019 We have a State Department, we have ambassadorial level that\u2019s involved in all of this. Why are you, the president\u2019s personal attorney, what is your personal \u2014 what\u2019s your mission?\u201d Fox News host Martha MacCallum asked Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\u201cTo disrupt the world,\u201d Mr. Giuliani replied. \u201cMy mission is to defend my client in the best traditions of the legal profession.\u201d\n\nDemocrats controlling the House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump last week after his administration tried to block Congress from seeing a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community. The White House subsequently released a rough transcript of a July phone call that triggered the complaint, and it showed that Mr. Trump repeatedly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, over the latter\u2019s ties to a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nMr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky during the call that Mr. Giuliani would be in touch, and Mr. Giuliani, who has repeatedly discussed his outreach to Ukrainian officials recently, was subpoenaed this week as part of the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cOur inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the president in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the office of the president,\u201d three Democratic House chairmen wrote in a letter to Mr. Giuliani this week.\n\nAppearing on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani denied he reached out to Ukrainians exclusively for the sake of attacking Mr. Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of my client to unravel the corruption in the Ukraine, which involved mostly collusion in the election into which Joe Biden inserted himself,\u201d said Mr. Giuliani.\n\nMr. Giuliani has claimed for months during media appearances that the former vice president pressured Ukraine while in office to fire a prosecutor who had been investigating a company that counted his son among its board members. The Democratic candidate has denied wrongdoing, and several past and current Ukrainian government officials have said there is no evidence to indicate the Bidens broke any laws.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s campaign asked cable news network earlier this week to stop granting airtime to Mr. Giuliani, citing his \u201cincreasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies.\u201d He has appeared repeatedly since on Fox News.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
