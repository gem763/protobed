I settle on what\u2019s at the top of my mind: \u201cMy only #fear is being a nobody.\u201d How could I know this exchange would begin a dialogue that would continue nearly every day for the next nine years of my life?\n\nI began using Twitter in 2010 as a newly minted high school freshman. Though it began as a hub for my quirky adolescent thoughts, over the years it became an archive of my emotional and intellectual voice \u2014 a kind of virtual display for the evolution of my politics and artistic identity. But after nine years, it was time to close the archive. My wanting to share my every waking thought became eclipsed by a desire for an increasingly rare commodity \u2014 a private life.\n\nThough I thought disappearing from social media would be as simple as logging off, my refusal to post anything caused a bit of a stir among my small but loyal following. I began to receive emails from strangers asking me where I had gone and when I would return. One message read: \u201cNot to be over familiar, but you have to come back eventually. You\u2019re a writer after all. How will we read your writing?\u201d Another follower inquired, \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d\n\nThe truth is I have not gone anywhere. I am, in fact, more present than ever.\n\nOver time, I have begun to sense these messages reveal more than a lack of respect for privacy. I realize that to many millennials, a life without a social media presence is not simply a private life; it is no life at all: We possess a widespread, genuine fear of obscurity.", "description": "I left social media to more fully embrace a private life.
