But key to what happens next is, of course, the EU\u2019s position.\n\nWhen UK (and European) commentators talk about the EU\u2019s stance on Brexit, they almost invariably conclude that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. Europe\u2019s unity is paramount. Ireland will not be sacrificed. The withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. Even suggesting that Germany\u2019s deteriorating economic conditions may give Berlin some pause for thought is tantamount to heresy. The EU\u2019s Brexit position is fixed in time and space.\n\nLike Macbeth, Johnson is too stepped in blood to turn back. Where next? | Andrew Rawnsley Read more\n\nThe truth, as always, is more nuanced, as I learned during meetings in Brussels at the end of last week. There is real debate in the EU about Brexit. The EU\u2019s position today is subtly different to that of two weeks ago. And its position of two weeks ago subtly different to that which came before. So where is the EU currently on Brexit?\n\nThe EU liked Olly Robbins, Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiator. Intelligent, thoughtful, persistent and tirelessly hardworking, he was widely respected among his EU peers as someone they could do business with. They were less keen on May herself. Their misgivings were well-founded. Robbins negotiated a Brexit deal widely recognised in Europe as an excellent outcome for the UK, in light of the red lines his prime minister had drawn at the time. Yet May proved incapable of managing the domestic politics and selling his deal. This provides the context for understanding how the EU sees Johnson.\n\nWhile there is a lot in him they dislike, they welcomed the fact he is a \u201cred-blooded politician\u201d, as one adviser to an EU head of state put it to me. A breath of fresh air compared to May. The fact Brexit is inherently political for Johnson \u2013 a means to a bigger Commons majority \u2013 creates the glimmer, no matter how slight, that he may be able to get a deal over the line. This, combined with Johnson\u2019s singular focus on the backstop, and his willingness to adopt \u201ca continental line\u201d on global issues at the G7 in Biarritz, gave EU leaders more confidence a deal could possibly be struck.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The EU liked Olly Robbins, Theresa May\u2019s Brexit negotiator.

But it\u2019s equally fair to say that the goodwill Johnson did establish is quickly ebbing. But this is not for the reasons people might think.\n\nIt is true that the government has not tabled any formal proposals to the EU yet. This reinforces scepticism in Westminster that the government is serious about a deal. However, senior EU officials and negotiators were not expecting much prior to the Tory party conference, which runs from 29 September to 2 October. The critical window they have earmarked were the weeks running into the 17-18 October European heads of state meeting in Brussels, and after, until 31 October.\n\nMoreover, trial balloons floated by No 10 have made their way to the EU\u2019s institutions and have been discussed by the 27 member states. These include radically reducing the backstop to sectoral elements and proposing a single all-Ireland regime for agriculture.\n\nDavid Frost, Johnson\u2019s most senior official for European affairs and the government\u2019s lead negotiator, has also clarified the government\u2019s approach to Brexit, clearly setting out new parameters for the negotiation. Unlike Robbins and May, the Johnson government is not seeking \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d with the EU while simultaneously leaving the EU\u2019s two economic institutions that are necessary to deliver it \u2013 the customs union and the single market. Instead, Johnson and Frost only want to \u201cfacilitate\u201d trade with the EU. They accept that Brexit will mean the UK\u2019s access to EU markets will suffer.\n\nThis is where Europe\u2019s concerns set in. The ideas floated by No 10 suggest a trade border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. As one senior EU negotiator puts it: \u201cThe backstop means no border on the island of Ireland. But the UK\u2019s solution will result in a customs and regulatory border \u2013 which will carry implications for peace.\u201d This is obviously unacceptable for the EU27.\n\nThe government also wants to bank the benefits of Brexit by diverging from EU rules to the maximum extent possible. Yet this has fostered the perception in EU capitals that the UK will compete with its firms by undercutting EU standards.\n\nNo-deal Brexit will not be clean break, Irish PM warns Boris Johnson Read more\n\nPolitically, it makes little strategic sense for the EU to compromise on the backstop \u2013 and risk its principles \u2013 if the purpose of doing so is to facilitate a deal over a bare-bones free trade agreement (FTA) that would not differ much from a no-deal outcome. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between no deal and a hard FTA?\u201d ponders another adviser to an EU head of state. In no deal, the EU would at least have stuck to its principles.\n\nOnce the EU factors in Johnson\u2019s tumultuous week in parliament \u2013 that has left him heading an even weaker minority government and facing the high likelihood of an early election \u2013 it\u2019s possible to see why its calculus is shifting it again towards a harder, less flexible position.\n\nAs the UK slides painfully towards an early election, there is less scope for progress in Brussels. Any formal UK proposals will become political fodder. The EU will have to become more cautious in its response; it will not risk its interventions becoming part of the campaign. As the EU ponders events in London, its window for a deal, while open, is closing.\n\n\u2022 Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director of Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm", "description": "As Johnson\u2019s position weakens, EU leaders are finding fewer reasons to yield to his Brexit \u2018solutions\u2019, says Mujtaba Rahman of political consulting firm Eurasia Group", "authors": ["Mujtaba Rahman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a73f334dffaefde1b8bfb77ef6d1dd319c67d6d/356_176_1492_895/master/1492.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=97c8c69f1e6b7e51029266affbe11e05", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
