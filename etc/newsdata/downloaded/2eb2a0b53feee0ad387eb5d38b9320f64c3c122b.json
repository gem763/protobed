Show Hide Eating too much sugar contributes to people having too many calories during the day, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight increases the risk of health problems such as heart diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Sugar is also one of the main causes of tooth decay. The NHS advises that most adults and children in the UK eat too much of a type of sugar called 'free sugars'. These are the sugars added to food and drinks, found in biscuits, chocolate, breakfast cereals and fizzy drinks. But they are also found naturally in honey and unsweetened fruit juices. The UK government\u2019s recommendation is that these 'free sugars' should not make up more than 5% of the calories you have every day. That is still quite a lot of sugar - it equates to seven sugar cubes worth for an adult. But bear in mind that one can of a fizzy drink can include the equivalent of 9 cubes of sugar. Children under 4 should avoid all sugar-sweetened drinks and food with added 'free sugars' in it. Martin Belam\n\n\n\nThe amount of sugar people in England consumed overall from eating those types of foods, which also includes confectionery, puddings, sweet sauces and morning goods such as pastries, rose by 2.6% between 2015 and 2018. That was despite the government in 2016 exhorting the food industry to contribute to the fight against obesity by delivering the 20% cut by 2020.\n\nThat 2.6% rise amounts to the equivalent of a 0.5% increase in sugar intake per head in England, although differences in consumer behaviour means that not everyone will be doing that.\n\nPHE\u2019s report says: \u201cOverall the total tonnes of sugar sold in foods included in the reformulation programme from the in-home sector has increased by 2.6% between 2015 and 2018 (excluding cakes and morning goods), whereas the sugar sold in soft drinks subject to the soft drinks industry levy has decreased by 21.6%.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "Public Health England figures deal blow to government\u2019s drive to combat obesity", "authors": ["Denis Campbell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9615460f7752aababcf6690950e912c6ab0ec7de/861_0_4478_2687/master/4478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b4bed1cb833661e9b2d26bb826dd170", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
