Colorado lies well within the United States, though its large southern neighbor New Mexico does border Mexico.\n\n\u201cYou know why we are going to win New Mexico? Because they want safety on their border,\u201d Trump said during a speech in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cAnd we are building a wall on the border of New Mexico, and we are building a wall in Colorado,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can\u2019t get over, you can\u2019t get under.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we are building a wall in Texas, and we are not building a wall in Kansas, but they get the benefit of the walls that we just mentioned,\u201d he added.\n\nBuilding a wall on the southern border with Mexico was one of the signature promises of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, but Congress has refused to pay for its construction.\n\nPoliticians and social media users reacted to Trump\u2019s comment with bafflement and mockery.\n\n\u201cWell this is awkward\u2026 Colorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico,\u201d tweeted the state\u2019s Governor Jared Polis.\n\n\u201cGood thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy tweeted a map showing a new international border drawn around New Mexico and a line obscuring the first half of the state\u2019s name so that it reads: Mexico.\n\nTrump later tweeted he had spoken of building a wall in Colorado \u201ckiddingly\u201d, and \u201crefered to people in the very packed auditorium, from Colorado & Kansas, getting the benefit of the Border Wall!\u201d", "description": "Pittsburgh (AFP) \u2013 Donald Trump has made building a barrier to stop migrants on the US-Mexico border a central plank of his presidency, but on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
