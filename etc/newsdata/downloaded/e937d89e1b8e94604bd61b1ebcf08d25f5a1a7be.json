So it\u2019s a good time for Simon Heffer to produce his account of how the Great War shaped Britain.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear from this extraordinarily detailed account is that the Great War (this was a term readers of The Times in 1915 decided to use) really did change Britain for ever; more than any other war.\n\nIt began, as the historian A.J.P. Taylor observed, in a different world, when \u2018a sensible, law-abiding Englishman could pass through life and hardly notice the existence of the state, beyond the post office and the policeman\u2019, and ended with the creation of the modern state.\n\nA young woman works in a London engineering shop for the General Omnibus Company in September 1917, due to a shortage in male workers\n\nBritain had waged total war, and everything changed because of it. Simon Heffer (who is, I should say, a friend), tells us how, from curbs on drinking to the rise of the Labour Party.\n\nThe sheer scale of the cull of young men remains hard, even now, to grasp \u2014 the bravest and best of a generation as well as reluctant conscripts. How would Britain look now if they hadn\u2019t died? There\u2019s no knowing.\n\nAround 705,000 men from the British Isles perished, more than 560,000 of them in Flanders; from the British Empire, another 250,000. The losses of officers was triple that of other ranks.\n\nAnd for all those young men, you can count the secondary casualties \u2014 the young women at home who never married and had families.\n\nBut, as Heffer says, \u2018nowhere was the unprecedented upheaval caused by the end of total war more apparent than in the position of women.\n\nWomen pictured working in a munitions factory in Shoreditch, London, in 1915\n\n\u2018The total number of working women rose by 22.5 per cent during the war, to 7.3 million [nearly a million of them in munitions].\u2019\n\nFemale recruitment began when Sylvia Pankhurst marched 30,000 women down Whitehall to the Ministry of Munitions demanding the right to serve. She got the vote in return.\n\nThese women were made redundant in short order when the men returned (one in five with venereal disease), but there was no return to the old world.\n\n\u2018Many who left domestic service in 1914 for the front or industry never returned below stairs . . . Middle-class families, used to having a housemaid or cook, had to learn that doing without was not just a wartime measure, but permanent.\u2019\n\nAnd so The Servant Problem was born; as a result, so too was the vacuum cleaner.\n\nTwo women work on shell casings at Vickers Ltd munitions factory in the UK in 1915\n\nSocial deference and the class system did not disappear in the war, but the author concludes that people no longer felt that \u2018someone deserved respect simply because he or she occupied a superior social station\u2019.\n\nIn a way it was a vindication for George Bernard Shaw, a plucky pacifist (he declared early on that the best thing troops could do would be to shoot their officers and return home), who observed that the democratic case for the conflict was that it would empower the working classes. And what about the causes of the war? This is not a military history, says the author. Yet it\u2019s impossible to write about the effects of the war without discussing how it came about and how it was fought.\n\nTHE MUNITIONETTES IN WW1 Produced 80 per cent of the weapons and shells used by the British Army. Were banned from wearing nylon, silk and bras with metal clips, all of which could cause friction and explosions. Worked with TNT, which turned their skin yellow, earning the nickname Canaries. Their babies were also born yellow, although the colour faded in time. Were searched by the first women police officers in the country, who were on the look-out for contraband. They were also ensuring the women did not sneak off for a quick cigarette where they could cause an explosion. EARNED 18 shillings a week, more than their counterparts in other factories or those working on the land.\n\nHow did the assassination of the unpopular heir to the Habsburg Empire, by a fanatical Serb \u2014 an event that raised barely a ripple at the time \u2014 result in the death of millions? Heffer\u2019s admirable summary is almost unbearable to read because it makes clear that war could have been avoided if statesmen had acted swiftly and urgently.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just German militarism that was to blame, but Austro-Hungarian intransigence and Russian insistence on solidarity with Slav brothers in Serbia against the Habsburgs.\n\nGermany felt in turn that it had to back Austria; France that it had to support its ally, Russia. Britain was under no obligation to get involved but it is clear from this account that even without the German invasion of Belgium, British statesmen could not have allowed Germany control of the Channel and of its ports.\n\nThe British foreign secretary, Edward Grey \u2014 who famously said \u2018The lights are going out all over Europe\u2019 \u2014 sensed that the great powers were headed towards catastrophe but he was unforgivably tardy in alerting the Cabinet to the dangers.\n\nAs Simon Heffer observes exasperatedly, why on earth did he take his concerns down to Hampshire to go fishing rather than to the chancelleries of Europe?\n\nThe one thing Heffer, in this wonderfully comprehensive history, doesn\u2019t answer is why \u2014 when Germany made overtures for peace in 1916 when the hell of trench warfare was known \u2014 there wasn\u2019t a clamour to take them up on the offer. It seems nuts to us now.\n\nThere are some unforgettable pictures of individuals.\n\nTwo women pictured working at the Cunard shell works in Bootle, Liverpool, in 1917\n\nChurchill emerges from this account as vain, bombastic and self-absorbed (disastrously so in the Dardanelles campaign) while Northcliffe, the proprietor of the Daily Mail and The Times, comes across unflatteringly as the embodiment of power without responsibility.\n\nSome of the shrewdest observers are women, including Mrs Asquith, the PM\u2019s wife.\n\nShe gives the book its title. \u2018Now that shrapnel is killing an entire generation,\u2019 she wrote, \u2018we are left staring at God.\u2019\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look any better a century on.", "description": "Simon Heffer has produced his account of how the Great War shaped Britain and changed it forever.
