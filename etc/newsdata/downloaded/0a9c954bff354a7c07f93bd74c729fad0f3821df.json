The rhythm of Girl is intermittent and fearsomely strong; reading this novel is like riding the rapids.\n\nAnd that, it seems to me, is what living in one of the world\u2019s too-numerous war-ravaged places must be like. The violence is awful, but just as awful, in a way, is the day-to-day accommodation to relentless illogic and unreason\u2014the creeping sense, at every moment, of certain disruption and displacement, sudden exile and loss. Girl captures that sort of existential dread as well as any war novel I know. Early on, Maryam describes the day of her kidnapping: \u201cWe enter dense jungle, trees of all kinds, meshed together, taking us into their vile embrace. Nature had gone amok here.\u201d That feeling of wrongness in nature is entirely new to her. Later, we learn that she had won a prize at school for an essay about trees, which did not seem then to embrace her vilely. Quite the contrary: \u201cIn our country we depend on trees for our lives,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFor shelter in rain and for shade in sun. For food of many kinds. They are our second home \u2026 But the most important aspect of the tree is the Tree Spirit. Ancestors who have died live there and govern lives. They ward off evil. If these sacred trees are harmed or lopped or burnt, ancestors get very angry and sometimes take revenge. Crops fail and people go hungry. \u201cDon\u2019t step on the spirits,\u201d my brother Yusuf would say when we did spells in there, tiptoeing over the bony roots that wound and knitted together. It was always at evening time. Birds did not roost there, but at certain times sang some song that was both inexplicably sweet and melancholy.\n\nShe dreams of this essay, at a moment when the very trees\u2014her second home\u2014have turned alien to her, malign. And when she wakes, in the Jihadis\u2019 camp, she tells her diary: \u201cI will never get out. I am here forever. I am asking God to please give me no more dreams. Make me blank. Empty me of all that was.\u201d\n\nThis is a vision of hell: a girl, hardly begun in her life, wishing to be emptied of all that was. O\u2019Brien has always been singularly alert to that sort of bleak emotion, especially when the despair is visited upon the young. It\u2019s no more of a stretch for her to imagine the feelings of a Nigerian teenager than it was for her 16 years ago to find her way into the mind of another girl undone by war, in her play Iphigenia, adapted from Euripides. Is the experience of a contemporary African girl really less accessible to a European writer of the 21st century than the Trojan War and the worldview of the ancient Greeks? Iphigenia discovers in the course of the play that her father, King Agamemnon, means to sacrifice her in order to appease the gods and, he hopes, reverse the flagging fortunes of the restive military he commands. That\u2019s a girl whose world has turned on her. Iphigenia naturally pleads with her father at first: \u201cDo not destroy me before my time \u2026 I love the light \u2026 do not despatch me down to the netherworld \u2026 hell is dark and creepy and I have no friends there \u2026 I am your child \u2026 I basked in your love.\u201d But by the inevitable end, she\u2019s telling her mother, \u201cOne must not love life too much.\u201d She\u2019s been emptied.", "description": "The setting of her new novel is terror-ridden Nigeria, a world away from her native Ireland, but the psychic territory is familiar.", "authors": ["Terrence Rafferty", "Edna O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/07/CULT_Girl_OBrien_Final_web/facebook.jpg?1564430227"}
