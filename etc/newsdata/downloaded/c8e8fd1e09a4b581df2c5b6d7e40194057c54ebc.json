Koji Sasahara/AP Photo Maezawa spoke about the deal during an emotional, roughly two-hour-long press conference on Thursday. Although he raised misgivings about how he managed the company in recent years, saying he regretted mistakes that hurt the company's bottom line, Forbes reported, he rationalized his departure in another and far more personal way: a need to prepare for his 2023 flight around the moon inside Starship.\n\nMaezawa also said he wanted to launch on a less ambitious spaceflight prior to SpaceX's privately funded circumlunar voyage.\n\n\"Training to go into space will to take up much of my time,\" Maezawa reportedly said.\n\nMaezawa first announced his bid for a weeklong Starship flight around the moon during a September 2018 presentation about the launch system by Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO. (It was then called Big Falcon Rocket, and has since been redesigned and renamed Starship, but the craft's core goals and capabilities remain similar.)\n\nThe fashion mogul, who is also an avid collector of art, named his experimental mission #dearMoon. He plans to handpick a crew that includes a \"painter, musician, film director,\" and other artists \u2014 and maybe a couple of astronauts\u2014 to \"inspire the dreamer within each of us\" with the trip.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Musk about his possible participation in the #dearMoon mission, he said (seemingly half-seriously), \"maybe we'll both be on it.\"\n\nMusk says progress on Starship is accelerating 'exponentially'\n\nStarhopper \u2014 SpaceX's first Mars Starship prototype \u2014 hovers over its launchpad during a test flight in Boca Chica, Texas, on August 27, 2019. Trevor Mahlmann/Reuters\n\nIf Starship is realized as currently envisioned by Musk, it will be a roughly 400-foot-tall, two-stage, steel-bodied vehicle. It'd also be the world's largest, most powerful, and paradoxically most affordable launch system because \u2014 unlike any orbital-class rockets today \u2014 it'd be fully reusable.\n\nMusk said he may beat NASA back to the lunar surface with Starship and launch the first humans to Mars with the system, perhaps 100 at a time. Musk is also dreaming up an even larger version of Starship, the scale of which stretches the imagination.\n\nRead more: SpaceX is eyeing these 9 places on Mars for landing its first Starship rocket missions\n\nMusk in 2018 estimated it'd cost between $2 billion and $10 billion to develop the first fully operational Starship system. Maezawa would not disclose last year how much he's paying SpaceX for the trip, though his investment is going toward simultaneous Starship development efforts in Boca Chica, Texas, and Cocoa, Florida.\n\nAn illustration of SpaceX's upcoming Starship spaceship (left), Super Heavy rocket booster (right), and an integrated Starship-Super Heavy launch system (center). \u00a9 Kimi Talvitie \"Progress is accelerating,\" Musk tweeted in August about the Starship development program, later adding that it's moving \"exponentially.\"\n\nSpaceX began building its first prototype, called Starhopper, at its Boca Chica launch site in late 2018. After a few short test launches or \"hops\" in April and July, the vehicle \u2014 which is a essentially a flying test-bed for SpaceX's new Raptor rocket engines\u2014 made its last experimental launch from Texas in August. The final flight took Starhopper about 490 feet (150 meters) into the air before it landed on a nearby concrete pad.\n\nSpaceX is now pushing to complete two orbital-class prototypes, called Starship Mk 1 and Mk 2 in Texas and Florida, respectively.\n\nNewly released FAA documents refer to this part of Starship's development program as \"Phase 3.\" As part of that phase, Musk tweeted on August 28 that SpaceX will try launching Starship Mk 1 about 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) above Texas in October before the company attempts an orbital launch \"shortly thereafter.\"\n\nMusk added that he would provide an update on the overall Starship development program on September 28. Previously, he said he would deliver that presentation from Boca Chica, Texas \u2014 possibly to do so with a fitting backdrop.\n\n\"Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time,\" he said.\n\nSpaceX representatives did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Maezawa's latest remarks, the #dearMoon mission, or overall on the Starship development program.", "description": "With SpaceX CEO Elon Musk at his side in September 2018, Yusaku Maezawa announced he'd be the first Starship passenger on a flight around the moon.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ba6832e22af0c7f00809f-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
