By the way, shouldn\u2019t she be in school? Reporters won\u2019t ask because most appear to buy into her secular doctrine that the apocalypse is just around the corner.\n\nGreta claims \u201cpeople are dying\u201d because the Earth is getting hotter. She warns that adults had better wake up or they will burn in ecological hell or perhaps even the real thing. Her theological qualifications have yet to be examined.\n\nThink back to when you were 16 and believed you knew it all. At 18, an adult called me \u201cprecocious\u201d (he didn\u2019t mean it as a compliment). I had to look up the meaning in a dictionary. It was a humbling experience.\n\nAs their adolescent brains continue to develop, most teenagers know only what their teachers and textbooks tell them and maybe their parents, if they still listen to them. Science textbooks mostly embrace the climate change scenario, so why wouldn\u2019t kids believe what they read and what they\u2019re taught?\n\nGreta was preparing to speak to the assembled adults at the U.N. when President Trump walked in ahead of her. The man knows showmanship. The expression on Greta\u2019s face was priceless. If spitting fire contributed to \u201cglobal warming,\u201d we\u2019d have been in real trouble.\n\nIt appears the girl is being held in intellectual captivity. She might benefit from consulting a list of \u201c50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalytpic Predictions\u201d compiled by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI.org), the nonprofit libertarian think tank based in Washington, D.C.\n\nJust a few examples:\n\nIn 1967, the Los Angeles Times carried a story headlined \u201cDire Famine Forecast by 1975.\u201d The story said it might \u201calready be too late.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 10, 1969, The New York Times quoted a 37-year-old scientist predicting a new ice age and that \u201ceveryone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam by 1989.\u201d\n\nAn April 16, 1970, story in the Boston Globe quoted Paul R. Erlich of the University of California, Riverside, predicting America will be \u201csubject to water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980.\u201d Mr. Erlich said the oceans would be as dead as Lake Erie in less than a decade.\n\nOn July 9, 1971, The Washington Post, which, like most other media, now claims climate change and a warming planet is \u201csettled science,\u201d thought differently then. It quoted S.I. Rasool of NASA and Columbia University. Mr. Rasool predicted a coming \u201cnew ice age.\u201d He was described as a \u201cleading atmospheric scientist,\u201d so he should be believed, right? He predicted we had only about \u201c50 or 60 years\u201d to save ourselves from freezing to death.\n\nOn her way back to Sweden, Greta should take along a copy of the CEI summary. She just may discover that some older people might know more than she does about most things and that those who preceded her in these \u201cChicken Little\u201d hysterics were as wrong then as she is now.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
