Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett said: \u201cWe have concluded that, whilst we should grant permission to apply for judicial review, the claim must be dismissed.\u201d\n\nTheir ruling comes in the same week the prime minister fought off a similar legal challenge in Scotland.\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Miller said she would appeal to the Supreme Court. \u201cAs our politics becomes ever more chaotic, we feel it is absolutely vital that parliament should be sitting. We are therefore pleased that the judges have given us permission to appeal to the Supreme Court which we will be doing, as we feel that our case has merit to be handed up.\n\n\u201cTo give up now would be a dereliction of our responsibility. We need to protect our institutions. It is not right that they should be shut down or bullied, especially at this momentum time in history.\u201d\n\nA Supreme Court hearing has been pencilled down for September 17.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "Campaigner pledges to appeal to Supreme Court saying that giving up now would be a \u2018dereliction of responsibility\u2019.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55439689-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
