REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Files\n\nRockets general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet, which he quickly deleted over the weekend. Beijing, Chinese fans and the team\u2019s partners in a key NBA market have not been assuaged, however, resulting in loss of sponsors and broadcasts in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nThe National Basketball Association issued a statement saying it regretted Morey\u2019s remarks, drawing criticism from U.S. lawmakers. At the same time, commissioner Adam Silver told Kyodo News the NBA supports freedom of expression - a response deemed unacceptable to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose Silver\u2019s support of Morey on the basis of freedom of speech and we think any comments that challenge a country\u2019s sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\u201d CCTV said Tuesday in a statement in Chinese, adding that it would review its relationship with the NBA.\n\nThe league\u2019s regular season, to which CCTV owns exclusive Chinese broadcast rights, begins this month. Tech giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) has exclusive internet streaming rights in China, which local media reports have said are worth about $1.58 billion; it has said it would temporarily stop showing Rockets games.\n\nThe decision heaps further pressure on the league, which faces criticism on multiple fronts about its handling of the controversy. Its apology on Sunday disappointed some who see the league as the most progressive of the U.S. sports organizations, while Silver\u2019s support for Morey\u2019s right to speak his mind has left the league vulnerable in China.\n\nThe league has worked for years to cultivate the Chinese market and regularly plays exhibition games in the country. Its top stars, including Rockets guard James Harden, frequently visit to meet fans and conduct promotional activities with sponsors.\n\nTencent said in July that 490 million Chinese fans watched NBA programming on its platforms last season, up threefold since the 2014-2015 season.\n\nRIGHT OF EXPRESSION\n\nSilver told Kyodo in an interview the league\u2019s stance was firm that members of the NBA community were free to express themselves and that the league backed their right to do so.\n\n\u201cThere are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days, and that includes free expression,\u201d Silver, in Japan for a preseason game on Tuesday between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors, told Kyodo.\n\n\u201cI think as a values-based organisation that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d he told the news agency. \u201cI accept that it is also Chinese governments\u2019 and Chinese businesses\u2019 right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\u201d\n\nSilver said the league also supported Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba Group (BABA.N) co-founder Joseph Tsai, who issued a lengthy statement criticising Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nA preseason game between the Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers is set for Thursday in Shanghai, with a rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen. However, organisers abruptly canceled a Tuesday media event in the city without explanation.\n\nSeveral Chinese celebrities also announced on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo service that they would not attend an NBA-organised \u201cfans\u2019 night\u201d Wednesday evening.\n\nBasketball - NBA - Washington Wizards v New York Knicks - The O2 Arena, London, Britain - January 17, 2019 Commissioner of the NBA Adam Silver during a press conference before the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers/Files\n\nActor and singer Evan Li said in a statement posted on his Weibo account that he would boycott the event, saying \u201cthe motherland always stands above everything.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is believed to earn billions of yuan a year from its Chinese merchandise sales, and fans said the league needed to take action.\n\n\u201cIf the NBA doesn\u2019t do anything about this matter, about Morey supporting Hong Kong independence, then should we think about how does the NBA view the Chinese market and Chinese fans?\u201d said Zhang Jinru, a Beijing high school student.", "description": "Chinese state television said on Tuesday it wouldn't air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week, heaping further pressure on the U.S. basketball league after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Chris Gallagher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438380546&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970IH", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
