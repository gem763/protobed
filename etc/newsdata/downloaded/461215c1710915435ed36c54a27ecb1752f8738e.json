This meant that the company was potentially missing out on a market worth about $100 million a year.\n\nImpossible Foods secured the FDA\u2019s OK on July 31 after a lobbying effort, and it began selling its Impossible Burger products in grocery stores in September. The approval has come as the company disclosed lobbying spending of $270,000. It reported $10,000 in Washington lobbying expenses in 2017, then $200,000 in 2018, and $60,000 in this year\u2019s first half, according to OpenSecrets.org data.\n\nImpossible Foods declined to say how much of that lobbying was directed at the FDA, with a spokeswoman saying it \u201cdoes not comment on lobbying expenses or strategies.\u201d But the company\u2019s outside lobbying firms have included BGR Group, which bills itself as an adviser on \u201clegislative and regulatory policy matters\u201d involving the FDA.\n\nHeme had not been sold before in uncooked form and was met with some skepticism from the FDA and consumer advocacy groups. Impossible Foods first had to prove that it was safe to eat the plant-based ingredient extracted from the roots of soybean plants. The FDA responded in July 2018 with a \u201cno questions response,\u201d which is seen as an approval.\n\nBut since heme is also used as a color additive that provide a \u201cbleed\u201d effect, Impossible Foods filed an additional petition with the FDA in November 2018. The petition was approved eight months later, clearing the way for distribution in grocery stores.\n\nRelated: I tried Beyond Meat\u2019s burgers three times \u2014 here\u2019s what I thought\n\nBeyond Meat Inc. BYND, -0.56% has not disclosed any lobbying spending in Washington, D.C. The El Segundo, Calif.-based company\u2019s meatless products, which feature pea protein and beet juice, appeared on store shelves in 2016. Beyond Meat has made an effort to emphasize that its offerings don\u2019t contain heme.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received a number of questions from our Beyond Meat consumers about heme, which we do not use,\u201d the company said in a post on its website in 2017.\n\n\u201cThese inquiries reinforced our understanding that folks often confuse us with Impossible Foods. We get it \u2014 there are some similarities. Our founder is named Ethan Brown. Impossible\u2019s founder is named Pat Brown (no relation). Also, Bill Gates is an investor in both companies. And we both make plant-based burgers that the media has dubbed as \u2018bleeding veggie burgers.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut then Beyond Meat\u2019s post highlighted a key difference, urging customers to look at a list of retailers already selling its products at that time: \u201cWe\u2019re up to about 2,000 stores nationwide!\u201d\n\nImpossible Foods is now finally getting a chance to play ketchup, if you will. The company last week emphasized that its Impossible Burger became the top-selling item at some grocery stories following its debut.\n\nRelated: How Beyond Meat can lose the lead in the plant-based meat category to Tyson\n\nAlso see: Why some restaurants are turning up their noses at Beyond Meat\n\nGrocery stores represent a growing distribution channel for Impossible Foods and its competitors, said MKM Partners analyst Brett Levy in a recent note.\n\n\u201cDistribution availability is inching up,\u201d Levy said. \u201cBeyond has been a more active player in the at-home channel, including the availability in the likes of major chains like Safeway and Kroger KR, +0.22% , but recent weeks have seen Impossible Foods products make their ways onto the shelves of a few west and east coast chains.\u201d\n\nSupermarkets look like a market worth at least $100 million a year, given that Beyond Meat alone has reported $54 million in retail revenue in this year\u2019s first half.", "description": "Just a few months ago, it was impossible for Impossible Burger\u2019s parent company to compete with Beyond Meat in grocery stores.
