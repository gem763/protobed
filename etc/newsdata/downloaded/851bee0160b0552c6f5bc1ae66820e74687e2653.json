Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nBlack students fight for equal access to early voting in rural Texas\n\nStudents at the historically black Prairie View A&M University used to be required to complete \u201cresidency questionnaires\u201d to prove their eligibility to vote. In the 1990s, some were arrested when they tried to cast ballots, on suspicion of improper voting. Some saw their power diluted when their campus was carved into three districts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd last year, when county leaders scheduled fewer early-voting hours on the university campus than in whiter communities nearby, they spoke out.The disparity tapped into deep feelings of marginalization and anger over long-standing efforts to keep black voters from the polls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWaller County has a very long history of racism,\u201d says political reporter Amy Gardner . \u201cAnd so the setting and the scene for this particular story is quite fraught.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018That makes him a product of this diabolical machine that the NFL has created\u2019\n\nThe New England Patriots released wide receiver Antonio Brown amid an NFL investigation of accusations of rape and sexual assault against him. The move is the latest chapter in a saga in which three teams have cut ties with the seven-time Pro Bowl selection since the end of last season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a remarkable case of self-destruction, self-sabotage,\u201d says sports columnist Jerry Brewer . \u201cAnd it involves a lot of the issues that are consistent with the problems that the NFL has yet to resolve \u2014 specifically, the way it reacts to players who are accused of violence and misconduct against women.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe billions in U.S. military funds diverted to pay for border wall\n\nThe Pentagon has indicated that funding for construction projects diverted to the border wall could create dire outcomes for troops and their families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMilitary construction is one of those things that\u2019s been brushed under the rug and ignored when people talk about DoD funding,\u201d says defense reporter Aaron Gregg . \u201cBasic things like housing or an ambulatory care center or a school often get overlooked. They\u2019re much cheaper, but they don\u2019t always have the same cachet in Congress.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGregg poured over defense budget documents and uncovered the projects that have been delayed or canceled as a result of the wall, including ones the Pentagon say could put lives at risk if left incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Amy Gardner on a case of alleged racial bias in the administration of a local election in Texas.
