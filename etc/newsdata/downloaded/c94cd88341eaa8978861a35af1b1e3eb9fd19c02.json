The series explores how the legacy of slavery continues to shape our society today.\n\nHannah-Jones says the year 1619 is as foundational of year to the shaping of this country as 1776 and explains why she writes black Americans have worked to perfect the ideals put forth by the founding fathers to ensure that all citizens are indeed created equally. Plus, she discusses her reaction to the overwhelming response to the project, and the impact she hopes it has on readers and on school curricula throughout the country.\n\nWe invite you to listen to the #CTMPodcast on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher, SoundCloud, TuneIn, RadioPublic, PocketCasts, Castbox and RSS feed.\n\nYou can email us your questions, comments and suggestions to CTMPodcast@cbsnews.com.\n\nHear more of our \"CBS This Morning\" original podcasts:\n\nMost Recent:\n\nUSTA CEO on pay equality, a decade of growth and last year's U.S. Open women's final | Audio\n\nSo You Want To Start a Podcast?
