U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue explains:\n\nAs alleged, Nerayoff and Hlady carried out an old-fashioned shakedown to be paid off with 21st century cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company at the center of the duo\u2019s extortion attempts is a Seattle-based enterprise that remains unnamed at press time. The company provides a cryptocurrency rewards program that provides users with crypto depending on how much they utilize the company\u2019s products.\n\nNerayoff is credited with designing the structure behind Ethereum-based initial coin offerings (ICOs). Interestingly, ICOs have lost a lot of traction in the crypto world as of late given their phony and untrustworthy roots. Many have emerged over the past two years seeking to raise funds for a false company that ultimately disappears halfway through operations with all the money they\u2019ve earned, or close completely, leaving investors with a useless coin, bruised egos and some very empty pockets.\n\nThe first extortion attempt from Nerayoff and his assistant is said to have taken place in the summer of 2017. Nerayoff agreed to host an ICO for the company in question in exchange for 22.5 percent of the funds raised. However, he later hit back at the firm, demanding more money than what was originally stated in his contract. He is alleged to have threatened the company into submission, who ultimately gave into his demands and later received no additional work from Nerayoff or his team.\n\nNerayoff should have quit while he was ahead, but the extortion attempts didn\u2019t end there. Hlady, in charge of operations at Nerayoff\u2019s company, also got in touch with the enterprise, saying that if he didn\u2019t get access to a loan of roughly 10,000 ether tokens, he would do all he could to destroy the company. This occurred in March of 2018. The company gave into these demands as well, but the loan was never repaid.\n\nDon\u2019t You Have Enough Money Already?\n\nThe owners of the company allege that they stayed in Nerayoff\u2019s home in New York once when bad whether prevented their traveling back to Seattle. During this time, both Hlady and Nerayoff purportedly entered their rooms and threatened them with violence if they didn\u2019t pay more money.\n\nNerayoff appeared in court Wednesday and has since been released on bail. Hlady also appeared in court and his been ordered to return for a second appearance. Granted both men are convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison.", "description": "Ethereum ICO architect Steven Nerayoff and his assistant have been arrested and charged with extortion and threats of violence.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/11/Ethereum-Mining.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
