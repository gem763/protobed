(AP Photo/Samantha Maldonado, File)\n\nE-cigarettes are currently the most used tobacco product among US teens.\n\nA 2016 Surgeon General's report found a 900 percent increase in e-cigarette use among young people from 2011 to 2015.\n\nIn September, a report from US Food and Drug Administration found that 27.5 percent of high school students are using e-cigarettes in 2019.\n\nIn its lawsuit, the St Charles district said that as a result of 'youth-targeted product design and marketing, and years of misstatements and omissions regarding its products, JUUL succeeded in addicting a generation of youth to nicotine.'\n\nThe Olathe district similarly accused the company of creating a nationwide 'epidemic of vaping' and said it had been 'forced to expend significant resources combating this public nuisance.'\n\nBoth districts, which are represented by some of the same attorneys, have accused JUUL of gross negligence and public nuisance.\n\nThey also claim that JUUL violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, a federal law originally passed to target organized crime that also allows civil lawsuits.\n\nThey are seeking unspecified money damages.\n\nOne legal expert told The New York Times that the school districts may have a hard time putting together a convincing case.\n\n'It has nothing to do with the school themselves,' Kathleen Hoke, a law professor at the University of Maryland who studies tobacco regulation told the newspaper.\n\n'The connection is to the students who have been marketed into addiction. I do think it's very unique.'\n\nThe litigation comes on the heels of an investigation into a slew of breathing illnesses related to vaping across the country\n\nThere have been 1,080 cases reported in mostly teens and young adults in 48 states, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released on Thursday.\n\nAt least 21 deaths, which have been suspected to be linked to vaping, have been reported in 18 states: Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Virginia.\n\nSome states, including New York, Michigan and Rhode Island, have moved to restrict the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nMassachusetts has gone even further, instituting a four-month ban on all vaping products, flavored or not.\n\nOn Friday, a New York judge blocked a state ban on most flavored e-cigarettes from taking effect after an industry group sued to challenge it, while a Massachusetts judge upheld that state's ban.\n\nJUUL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Two public school districts - of St Charles, Missouri, and Olathe, Kansas - have sued JUUL for targeting teenagers and forcing the schools to bear the expense of preventing students from vaping.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19446226-0-image-a-2_1570544613334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
